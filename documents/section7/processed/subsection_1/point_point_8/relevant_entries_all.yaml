  description: Ensemble-based anomaly detection systems (ADSs), using Boolean combination,
    have been shown to reduce the false alarm rate over that of a single detector.
    However, the existing Boolean combination methods rely on an exponential number
    of combinations making them impractical, even for a small number of detectors.
    In this paper, we propose weighted pruning-based Boolean combination, an efficient
    approach for selecting and combining accurate and diverse anomaly detectors. It
    works in three phases. The first phase selects a subset of the available base
    diverse soft detectors by pruning all the redundant soft detectors based on a
    weighted version of Cohen's kappa measure of agreement. The second phase selects
    a subset of diverse and accurate crisp detectors from the base soft detectors
    (selected in Phase1) based on the unweighted kappa measure. The selected complementary
    crisp detectors are then combined in the final phase using Boolean combinations.
    The results on two large scale datasets show that the proposed weighted pruning
    approach is able to maintain and even improve the accuracy of existing Boolean
    combination techniques, while significantly reducing the combination time and
    the number of detectors selected for combination.

    Intrusion detection systems (IDS) are divided into two categories: Network intrusion
    detection systems (NIDS) and host-based intrusion detection systems (HIDS). A
    NIDS monitors and analyzes network traffic. It is transparent (i.e., it can move
    in different locations) and independent (i.e., it can work in different network
    topologies). An HIDS works on a host computer and monitors user activities to
    detect unauthorized access, illegitimate modification of configuration files,
    and other unwanted behaviors. IDS can be further classified into two categories:
    1) Signature-based (or misuse) IDS; and 2) anomaly detection systems (ADSs). The
    former can only detect known attacks [30], whereas the latter, the focus of this
    paper, is capable of detecting novel attacks by analyzing deviations from the
    normal behavior of a system. Anomaly detection methods often vary in their design
    depending on the application domain [62], but the common practice is to train
    a model that characterizes the normal behavior of a system. The model is used
    later as a baseline to detect deviations (anomalies) from normalcy. When a trained
    model produces scores instead of a decision (i.e., normal or anomalous), it is
    called a soft detector. When it produces a decision instead of scores, it is called
    a crisp detector. A soft detector can be converted into one or more crisp detectors
    by setting different thresholds on the output scores. A single crisp detector,
    however, is known to generate an excessive number of false alarms, which is one
    of the main reasons that limits deployment of ADS in commercial settings [20].
    Training an anomaly detector is a one-class classification problem that depends
    on the normal (or healthy) data. The detector, which in our case is based on HMM,
    is trained using the normal traces and expected to represent the normal behavior
    of the system. It should be noted that we used HMM because it has been shown to
    provide best accuracy [41] compared to other classification techniques. Our approach,
    however, can be used with any other one-class classification method. The combination
    of several soft or crisp detectors requires a labeled dataset including both normal
    and anomalous traces to be able to select the best crisp detectors, and the Boolean
    combination functions to optimize the performance (i.e., minimize the fpr and
    maximize the tpr ). In practice, the evaluation of an ADS requires a labeled validation
    set to select the operating thresholds (e.g., tolerable fpr ). Our approach takes
    further advantage of this validation set to select the operating thresholds and
    Boolean functions that yield the most accurate and concise ensemble of detectors,
    which will be used during system operation. In this paper, we propose a weighted
    pruning of Boolean combinations that selects the best subset of diverse base soft
    detectors by pruning all the redundant ones. Each diverse base soft detector is
    then used independently to select the complementary crisp detectors instead of
    brute-force search like in PBC. The complementary crisp detectors are then combined
    by leveraging both pair-wise brute-force Boolean combination (BBC2) and iterative
    Boolean combination (IBC) [1], [21], which shows that the pruning approach can
    be used with any Boolean combination approach. We leverage both weighted and unweighted
    Cohen''s kappa [46], [58] in order to select the best subset of diverse base soft
    detectors. Weighted Cohen''s kappa is a special case of simple kappa (unweighted
    kappa) that is particularly used when the agreements between two detectors are
    ordinal instead of nominal. In our case, the scores of a soft detector are ordinal,
    and the decision of a crisp detector based on a given threshold is nominal. Our
    weighted pruning approach prunes both soft and crisp detectors based on the ordinal
    agreements and the nominal agreements between two detectors. The selected diverse
    and accurate crisp detectors are then used for Boolean combination. During combination,
    we leverage both the pair-wise and IBC s introduced by Barreno et al. [1] and
    Khreich et al. [21], respectively. The proposed pair-wise weighted pruning Boolean
    combination (namely called WPBC2) fuses and combines all possible pairs of crisp
    detectors generated from the selected diverse base soft detectors. Whereas, the
    weighted pruning iterative Boolean combination (namely called WPIBC) fuses and
    combines the selected diverse base soft detectors sequentially until no significant
    improvement is possible. Another major contribution of this paper is the evaluation
    of our approach for detecting anomalies at the system call levels. We compare
    the performance of WPBC2 and WPIBC to that achieved with the original BBC2 and
    IBC techniques. In addition, we compare the performance of our approaches to pruning
    Boolean combination (PBC) [45]. In sum, the main contributions of this paper are
    as follows. We propose an anomaly detection approach that enforces the diversities
    among the combined soft and crisp detectors using weighted and unweighted Cohen''s
    kappa [46]. The approach can be used with both pair-wise and IBC techniques [1],
    [21], and easily adaptable to other Boolean combination methods. We evaluate our
    approach on two large publicly available system call datasets: ADFA linux dataset
    (ADFA-LD) [6] and CANALI windows dataset (CANALI-WD) [47]. We show that our approach
    outperforms BBC2, IBC, and PBC by achieving lower false positive rate, while maintaining
    and improving the detection accuracy, measured using area under the curve (AUC).
    The organization of this paper is as follows. The related anomaly detection approaches
    are discussed in Section II. HMM-based ADSs using system call sequences are discussed
    in Section III. The convex hull under the receiver operating characteristics (ROC)
    space and related Boolean combination techniques are explained in Section IV.
    The proposed weighted pruning-based Boolean combination techniques are discussed
    in Section V. Section VI presents the proposed method for pruning the Boolean
    combination as well as the results of the experiments that are carried out on
    two benchmarks datasets of system call sequences. The effects of pruning-based
    Boolean combination are discussed in Section VII. The limitations of our approach
    are discussed in Section VIII. The conclusion and future work are reported in
    Section IX. SECTION II. Related Research Anomaly detection is an important component
    used to enhance system reliability and security in a variety of domains. In their
    detailed survey, Chandola et al. [62] showed that anomaly detection is used in
    a wide variety of applications such as fraud detection for credit cards, insurance
    or health care, intrusion detection for cyber-security, fault detection in safety
    critical systems, and military surveillance for enemy activities. Anomaly detection
    techniques have also been shown useful in enforcing the reliability of software
    and hardware systems. Murtaza et al. [67] presented an approach and a supporting
    tool to detect program functions that are likely to introduce faults in a software
    system by examining historical execution traces. Their approach can be used to
    enhance testing and other software verification methods. In a recent study, Sha
    et al. [68] proposed an approach based on anomaly detection to ensure the safety
    of cloud-based IT infrastructures. Bovenzi et al. [69] proposed an approach for
    revealing anomalies at the operating system level to support online diagnosis
    activities of complex software systems. Yang et al. [70] proposed an efficient
    method for detecting abnormal executions of Java programs using sequential pattern
    mining. Gizopoulos et al. [71] argued that the huge investment in the design and
    production of multicore processors may be put at risk because of reliability threats,
    mainly due to the existence of bugs and vulnerabilities, unless these systems
    are equipped with robust anomaly detection tools. They proposed multicore processor
    architectures that integrate solutions for online error detection, diagnosis,
    recovery, and repair during field operation. Several studies (e.g., [11], [41])
    showed that the temporal order of system calls issued by a process to request
    kernel services is effective in describing normal process behavior. This has led
    to a considerable amount of research studies that investigated various techniques
    for detecting anomalies at the system call level (see survey in [12]). Among these,
    sequence time-delay embedding (STIDE) and hidden Markov models (HMMs) are the
    most commonly used [41]. Ensemble methods have been proposed to improve the overall
    ADS accuracy by combining the outputs of several accurate and diverse models [7],
    [23], [25], [44]. In particular, combining the outputs from multiple crisp HMM
    detectors generated from multiple soft HMM detectors, each trained with a different
    number of states, in the ROC space, has been shown to provide a significant improvement
    in the detection accuracy of system call anomalies [11], [21], [41]. Among existing
    combination approaches, the pair-wise BBC2 combines all possible pairs of crisp
    detectors by fusing all types of Boolean functions [1]. BBC2 reported a significant
    improvement in reducing false alarms as compared to a single learned model [1].
    However, an exhaustive brute-force search to determine optimal combinations leads
    to an exponential number of combinations, which is prohibitive even for a small
    number of detectors [1]. To address this, Khreich et al. [21] proposed an IBC
    approach for combining relatively a large number of soft HMM detectors while avoiding
    the exponential explosion of BBC2. However, IBC produces a sequence of combination
    rules that grows linearly with both the number of soft HMM detectors and the number
    of iterations, which is difficult to analyze and understand. Furthermore, the
    algorithm is sensitive to the order of the combined crisp HMM detectors, making
    it challenging to find the best subset for combination operations. It is clear
    that if the number of combined crisp detectors (K) increases, the computation
    time and complexity also increase linearly for IBC and exponentially for BBC2.
    Moreover, we also know that the performance of an ensemble method is highly dependent
    on the diversity of combined detectors [27], [53]. The question is: how can we
    select the smallest and most diverse subset of detectors (among all the available
    ones) that can maintain or improve the detection accuracy (while reducing the
    false alarm rate) using the smallest number of Boolean combinations? In previous
    work [45], we proposed an effective PBC method based on Cohen''s kappa [5] coefficient
    (a statistical measure of the degree of agreement between two classifiers). MinMax-Kappa,
    a pruning technique of PBC, selects a small subset of diverse and accurate crisp
    HMM detectors based on measuring the kappa coefficients between each crisp HMM
    detector''s decision and the true decision labels (or ground truth) provided by
    the validation set (comprising both normal and attack traces). MinMax-Kappa computes
    the kappa values for all possible crisp HMM detectors, and then sets Min (minimum
    kappa value) and Max (maximum kappa value) boundaries with sorting them in an
    ascending order. After that, MinMax-Kappa selects 50% crisp HMM detectors whose
    kappa values are close to Min and another 50% crisp HMM detectors whose kappa
    values are close to Max. However, PBC uses the kappa coefficients between two
    crisp HMM detectors, it cannot ensure the diversity among soft HMM detectors.
    For example, if the scores of a subset of available soft HMM detectors on a validation
    set are almost the same, the responses of the crisp HMM detectors at a decision
    threshold of these redundant soft HMM detectors will probably be the same. Particularly,
    the computed kappa values for each crisp HMM detectors generated from these redundant
    soft HMM detectors will probably be almost equal. So, if the kappa value of one
    of these redundant crisp HMM detectors is close to Min or Max, the chances of
    selecting the rest of the redundant crisp HMM detectors are very high. Therefore,
    only one soft HMM detector from this subset of redundant soft HMM detectors should
    be used, whereas the rest of the redundant soft HMM detectors should be pruned
    before converting them into crisp HMM detectors. SECTION III. HMMs for Anomaly
    Detection Using System Call Sequences The sequences of system calls collected
    from the system call traces are known to provide a stable signature of normal
    behavior of a process [11], [41] , [47]. There are two properties of system call
    sequences that make them potential features for anomaly detection. The first property
    is uniqueness, where different processes generate different patterns of system
    call sequences. The second one is the matching probability, which tends to be
    low when an intruder is attempting to alter the normal sequential pattern of system
    calls of a process. Researchers from diverse disciplines use these two important
    properties of a system call sequence, which have been proposed in a large number
    of anomaly detection techniques such as neural network [15], k-nearest neighbors
    [29], Markov models [19], [31], and Bayesian models [24]. To the best of our knowledge,
    the very first approach for anomaly detection is based on sequence matching [11],
    [41]. During training, this approach builds the normal profile by segmenting the
    full-length sequences of system calls into a fixed-length contiguous subsequences
    using a fixed-size sliding window, shifted one by one symbol. In testing, an unknown
    sequence of system calls is also segmented into subsequences (as in training)
    and classified as normal if all subsequences are present in the normal profile.
    Otherwise, it is classified as an attack. HMM has been shown to be a very effective
    method to model a system''s behavior over time [36]. An HMM is a stochastic model
    for sequential data determined by the two interrelated mechanisms—a latent Markov
    chain having a finite number of states and a set of observation probability distributions,
    each one associated with a state. An HMM is typically determined by three parameters
    λ=(A,B,π) , which represent the states and transition probability distribution
    (A) of a system in a Markov process, the observation probability distribution
    (B) of observation sequences that comes from the temporal order of executions
    of a system, and the initial state probability distribution (π) of each hidden
    state in a Markov process. The first parameter A is usually hidden in an HMM.
    The only physical events are the observation sequence (B) that are associated
    with the hidden states of a Markov process. Fig. 1 illustrates a generic topology
    of an HMM, λ=(A,B,π) [48]. Fig. 1. General topology for an HMM model. Show All
    Number of hidden states (N) : To learn an HMM, we have to set the number of hidden
    states (N) in a Markov process. Let the distinct states be S i , i={0,1,…, N−1}
    . The notation X t = S i represents the hidden state sequence at time t. Number
    of observation symbols (M) : To learn an HMM, we have to set the number of observation
    symbols (M) . Let the distinct observation symbols be R k , k={0,1,…, M−1} . The
    notation O t = R k   represents the observed symbol R k at time t for the given
    observation sequence O−( O 0 , O 1 , …,  O T−1 ) , where T is the length of the
    observation sequence. State transition distribution (A) : The first row stochastic
    process is the hidden state transition probability distribution matrix A={ a ij
    } . A is an N×N square matrix, and the probability of each element { a ij } is
    denoted in (1) as a ij i,j =P(state  S j  at t+1|state  S i  at t) ={0,1,…,N−1}.
    (1) View Source The transition from one state to the next is a Markov process
    of order one [36] . This means the next state depends only on the current state
    and its probability value. As the original states are “hidden” in HMM, we cannot
    directly compute the probability values in the past. But we are able to observe
    the observation symbols for the current state S i at time t from a given observation
    sequence O to learn an HMM model. Observation symbol distribution (B) : The second
    row stochastic process is the observation symbol probability distribution matrix
    B={ b j ( R k )} . B is an N×M dimensional matrix that is computed based on the
    observation sequences (i.e., the temporal order of executions of a system). The
    probability of each element b j ( R k ) is denoted in (2) as b j  ( R k )= P(observation
    symbol  R k  at t|state S j  at t). (2) View Source Initial state distribution
    ( π ): The third row stochastic process is the initial state probability distribution
    π={ π i } . π is a 1×N row matrix, and the probability of each element { π j }
    is denoted in ( 3) as π i = P(state  S i  at t=0). (3) View Source A. Training
    an Ergodic HMM The behavior of a system can be discrete (e.g., symbols from a
    finite alphabet) or continuous (e.g., signals from a speech, music, etc.). In
    our case, the behavior of a process in UNIX or Windows system can be represented
    as a discrete sequence of system calls. Since a discrete HMM is a stochastic process
    for sequential data [36], [48], we can use it to learn the behavior of a process.
    A well-trained HMM model using the discrete normal sequences of system calls can
    be used as a potential model for detecting anomalies. Practically, training an
    HMM using a discrete sequence of observation O−( O 0 , O 1 , …,  O T−1 ) aims
    at maximizing the likelihood function P(O| λ) over the parameter space represented
    by A, B , and π . The Baum–Welch (BW) algorithm is one of the most commonly used
    expectation-maximization algorithm for learning the HMM parameters [2] . The BW
    algorithm is an iterative procedure to estimate the HMM parameters. It uses a
    forward-Backward (FB) algorithm [48] at each iteration to efficiently evaluate
    the likelihood function P(O| λ) , and then updates the model parameters until
    the likelihood function stops improving or a maximum number of iterations is reached.
    In our experiments, we have chosen the BW algorithm to train all HMMs using the
    system calls datasets. The user-defined three initial distributions of A, B ,
    and π , and two fixed-value parameters of M and N have an impact on the performance
    of HMM. The common solution for the initial distributions of A, B, and π is the
    random initialization and the use of validation set to select the best parameters
    [49] . We have also initialized the distributions of A, B, and π randomly and
    repeated the training process ten times. The initial distributions for which we
    obtain the highest AUC on the validation set are selected. The alphabet size M
    is defined by the number of distinct system calls in a system. However, it is
    difficult to define the number of states N in advance. The reason for that is
    a single HMM trained with a predefined number of states N may have limited chances
    to fit the underlying structure of the data [36]. In fact, the underlying distribution
    of sequences of system calls at different states varies according to the architectural
    complexity of a system and results in many local maxima of the log-likelihood
    function [20]. To tackle the variations in the underlying distribution of the
    sequences of system calls, ensemble HMMs have shown to be a better choice than
    a single HMM [7], [23]. The ensemble methods have reported that the diversity
    among the ensemble classifiers is an essential factor in increasing the accuracy.
    In particular, Khreich et al. [21] showed that the IBC of the responses of several
    accurate and diverse HMM detectors significantly increases the accuracy while
    reducing the number of false alarms. We have also trained different discrete-time
    ergotic HMMs with various N using the BW algorithm. These ergodic HMMs are the
    primary inputs to the proposed weighted pruning approach for Boolean combination.
    B. Soft and Crisp HMM Detectors In a binary classification problem, any trained
    model that produces a score instead of a decision (i.e., positive or negative)
    is called a soft detector. During operation, a trained HMM (λ) outputs a score
    computed by the FB algorithm. The score is the likelihood or the probability P(
    O 1:T | λ) for a given new observation sequence O 1:T . Normally, the score provided
    by λ should be significantly high, if the new observation sequence O 1:T is normal;
    otherwise, it is considered as an anomaly if the score is comparatively low. Since
    the output of a trained HMM is a score instead of a decision (normal or anomalous),
    then this model λ is a soft detector. On the other hand, in a binary classification
    problem, any trained model that produces a decision (i.e., positive or negative)
    instead of a score is called a crisp detector. We can convert a soft detector
    to one or more crisp detectors by setting one or more thresholds θ on the output
    scores produced by a soft detector. A crisp detector always gives a decision whether
    the testing sequence is normal ( score≥θ ) or anomalous ( score<θ ) based on a
    predefined threshold, θ . However, because of the limited amount of representative
    data, complex behavior of a system, and imbalanced distributions of classes, it
    is difficult to determine a threshold on the scores that will always separate
    the normal and anomalous sequences during operation [21]. Therefore, a single
    crisp HMM detector may generate a large number of false alarms. The Boolean combination
    of responses of multiple crisp HMM detectors (crisp-HMMs) in the ROC space have
    been shown to decrease the false alarm rate [21]. The crisp-HMMs are produced
    by setting various thresholds on the scores of the multiple soft HMM detectors
    (soft-HMMs). The following section introduces the two most useful Boolean combination
    techniques BBC2 and IBC for combining crisp-HMMs and also reports on their limitations.
    SECTION IV. ROC-Based Boolean Combination Techniques The ROC curve is a commonly
    used metric for evaluation of detectors’ performance. It plots the performances
    of a binary classifier in a 2-D space [9], where, y-axis represents the true positive
    rate (tpr) , and x-axis represents the false positive rate (fpr) for every possible
    crisp detector. The tpr is the proportion of correctly classified positive responses
    over the total number of positive samples tested by a crisp detector. The fpr
    is the proportion of incorrectly classified negative responses over the total
    number of negative samples tested by a crisp detector. Therefore, a single crisp
    detector plots a single point (fpr, tpr) in an ROC space, whereas a soft detector
    produces an ROC curve by connecting all the possible crisp detector''s points
    at various decision thresholds. A. ROC Convex Hull (ROCCH) All the points in an
    ROC space can be classified into two groups superior and inferior based on their
    tpr and fpr . Suppose a and b are two operating points in the ROC space, a is
    defined as superior to b , if fp r a ≤fp r b and tp r a ≥tp r b . If an ROC curve
    has tpr(∗)>fpr(∗) for all its points (∗) , then it is a proper ROC curve. The
    ROCCH is therefore the piece-wise outer envelope connecting only its superior
    points [6], [9], [52]. The linear interpolation is used to connect the two adjacent
    superior points so that, no points in an ROC space lies out of the final ROCCH
    curve. The accuracy of an ROCCH curve is measured by the AUC. The ROCCH can be
    used for the combination of two or more crisp classifiers in an ROC space [50],
    [51]. However, ROCCH combination rules discard the inferior points without verifying
    their combination in order to improve the system performance. The following section
    introduces the Boolean combination approaches [1] , [21], [54] of multiple ROC
    curves and showed that the new composite ROCCH improves the AUC as compared to
    the original ROCCH. B. Boolean Combination of ROC Curves The very first Boolean
    combination approach, proposed by Daugman [54], used only the conjunction (and)
    and disjunction (or) rules and fused on all the responses in an ROC space. The
    author applied these rules in a biometric test and concluded that the new composite
    ROCCH may increase the AUC of the ROC curve. As a consequence, other researchers
    also applied the and or or combination to combine soft detectors [55], [56]. For
    example, consider a pair of soft detectors ( S a ,  S b ), and the various decision
    thresholds are Ta and Tb , respectively. In a pairwise combination, the and or
    or rules are fused between each pair of converted crisp detectors ( C a i , C
    b j ) . The optimum thresholds are then selected based on the Neyman–Person test
    1 [52]. Finally, the selected optimum thresholds along with the corresponding
    Boolean functions are stored and used during operation. However, the and and or
    combinations cannot provide optimal thresholds when the training and validation
    datasets are limited and imbalanced [21]. The reason for the limited and imbalance
    data may lead to the appearance of large concavities in the resulting ROC curves
    [57]. In particular, the false alarm may be increased, if we fuse the best detector
    and the worst detector. But, the diversity among the combined detectors is an
    important factor in order to improve the performance while reducing the false
    alarm rate [53]. Therefore, further improvement is possible by including the other
    Boolean rules, in addition to the and and or rules. The following sections introduce
    the two most common combination techniques using all Boolean rules: 1) Pairwise
    brute- BBC2 [1]; and 2) IBC [21]. We also report on the limitations and complexities
    of these techniques. C. Pair-Wise BBC2 The pair-wise BBC2 fuses all possible pairs
    of crisp detectors generated from all the available soft detectors using all Boolean
    functions. As BBC2 uses all Boolean functions, it implicitly combines responses
    of both accurate and diverse crisp detectors at both superior and inferior points
    in the ROC space. However, the pair-wise brute-force strategy is computationally
    expensive due to the high number of permutations. For example, if the number of
    crisp detectors is N, there are N2 possible combinations for only one Boolean
    function. Barreno et al. [1] reported that exploiting all Boolean functions using
    an exhaustive brute-force search to determine optimum points leads to an exponential
    number of combinations. D. Iterative Boolean Combination (IBC) IBC avoids the
    impractical exponential explosion associated with the BBC2 by combining the emerging
    responses on a composite ROCCH sequentially. It first combines the first two ROC
    curves of the first two soft detectors. Then, the combined ROCCH, particularly,
    the emerging points are combined with the next ROC curve, and so on until the
    Kth ROC curve is combined. IBC repeats these sequential combinations iteratively
    until there are no further improvements or it reaches to a predefined maximum
    number of iterations. However, in practice, IBC requires a sequence of combinations
    of 11 to 20 crisp detectors to reach a final point on the final composite ROCCH
    [45]. In fact, it grows linearly with the increase of the number of iterations.
    Tracking and analyzing such a long sequence of combination rules during testing
    time increase the complexity of IBC. Moreover, the order of combined crisp detectors
    makes the IBC algorithm more sensitive to finding the best subset. It is evident
    that the computation time and complexity increase exponentially for BBC2 and linearly
    for IBC with the increase of the number of combined soft detectors (K), and thus
    making them inefficient. Our proposed pruning approach select the smallest and
    most diverse subset of detectors (among all available ones), which does not only
    reduce the computation time and complexity for Boolean combinations but also maintains
    or improves the detection accuracy (while reducing the false alarm rate) using
    the smallest number of Boolean combinations. SECTION V. Proposed Weighted Pruning
    Technique The proposed weighted pruning based Boolean combination approach leverages
    both weighted and unweighted kappa measures of (dis)agreement. The main novelty
    of this paper is to ensure the diversity among the scores of all the available
    ensemble of soft detectors by pruning the redundant soft detectors using weighted
    kappa. Then, our approach applies the unweighted kappa based MinMax-Kappa pruning
    technique (one of the pruning techniques of PBC) individually on each selected
    diverse base soft detectors and selects the complementary crisp detectors. At
    the end, we merge all the selected complementary crisp detectors from each selected
    diverse base soft detectors and use them for Boolean combination. A. Kappa Measure
    of (Dis)Agreement Cohen''s kappa or simply called kappa is a statistical tool
    that is widely used for measuring the interrater reliability or (dis)agreement
    between raters [5]. There are two types of kappa coefficients that can be used
    in computing the interrater reliability. The unweighted kappa coefficient is the
    simplest version of kappa [58] that is used only for nominal category. The weighted
    kappa coefficient is an extended version of kappa [46] that is used when the category
    is ordinal [59]. Our pruning techniques leverage both kappa coefficients. The
    weighted kappa coefficient is used to prune the redundant soft detectors when
    the level of scores is ordinal (thresholds). The unweighted kappa coefficient
    is used to prune the trivial and redundant crisp detectors when the decision is
    nominal (anomaly/normal). The contingency matrix for both kappa coefficients of
    (dis)agreement is defined on two detectors. Let the two detectors be D1 and D2
    , and the contingency matrix is C n×n . Here, n is the order of levels. For unweighted
    kappa coefficient, n is fixed to two, i.e., either positive or negative. For weighted
    kappa coefficient, n is equal to the number of levels or thresholds with the assumption
    that both detectors have the same number of constant levels or thresholds. An
    example of a contingency table C 2×2 for n=2 is given in Table I. Where, each
    element a ij represents the number of instances on which detector D1 and detector
    D2 agree at level i and level j . The sum of all elements in Table I is equal
    to the size of the validation set. TABLE I Contingency Matrix For the weighted
    kappa coefficient, we need to define the weighted matrix W in addition to the
    contingency matrix C . Among the many possible weighting schemes, the linear weighting
    scheme is effective when one order is important than the next one [60]. We also
    use linear weight when the order is the number of thresholds, and the distance
    between two thresholds is important to define whether two soft detectors are similar
    or diverse. We can compute the linear weighting matrix W using W = w ij =1− abs(i−j)
    n−1 . (4) View Source When C and W are the same dimensional square matrices, the
    kappa coefficient for both unweighted and weighted kappa can be computed based
    on the Hadamard product ( o ) [46] or element-wise product of matrices according
    to kp= p a − p ε 1− p ε (5) View Source where p a = sum(CoW) is the proportion
    of weighted agreement (for unweighted kappa, W=I means complete agreement). The
    parameter p ε is the proportion of agreement due to chance and computed using
    (6) as p ε =( c n×1  × r 1×n )oW. (6) View Source Here, c n×1 denotes a column
    matrix in which each element is the sum of each row of C . Similarly, r 1×n is
    a row matrix in which each element is the sum of each column of C . The kappa
    coefficient kp computes the interrater reliability based on the proportion of
    agreement ( p a ) and agreement due to chance ( p ε ), where the degrees of disagreement
    are controlled by the weight matrix W ( W=I for unweighted kappa that means no
    degrees of disagreement). Therefore, kp=1 indicates perfect agreement (i.e., both
    detectors agree at the same level for every instances), and kp= 0 indicates that
    any agreement is totally due to chance. The value of kp might also be negative.
    Negative values indicate that both detectors are negatively correlated, and such
    complementary detectors are important in the combination of ensemble techniques
    [27], [53]. In the rest of this paper, we use the running example shown in Fig.
    2 to describe the phases of our approach. In this example, we have selected three
    HMM-based detectors, D 1 , D 2 , and D 3 by varying the number of hidden states.
    Fig. 2(a) shows the scores of each detector. Fig. 2. Simple example of weighted
    and unweighted kappa for pruning redundant soft and crisp detectors. Show All
    Phase1-Pruning using weighted kappa: The first phase of Algorithm 1 describes
    the steps for pruning the redundant soft detectors using weighted kappa coefficient
    kp . Suppose, we have K soft detectors and they produce S k {k=1…K} score vectors
    using a validation set V . In the example of Fig. 2, K = 3 and the scores for
    each detector are shown in Fig. 2(a). Let the number of thresholds of each soft
    detector be n k . In the example of Fig. 2, n k = 4 . Therefore, we have K ROC
    curves ( S k , n k ) with probably K different AUC values. In each iteration (lines
    7–18 in Algorithm 1), we select one out of K available soft detectors for which
    the AUC is maximum and use it as a base soft detector S b . We store S b onto
    B (line 9 in Algorithm 1) for the next Phase2. Now, we compute the weighted kappa
    coefficients kp between S b and each of the rest K←K− S b soft detectors, where
    the thresholds n k of S b are used as an order or levels. Then, the soft detectors
    among the K− S b soft detectors, which perfectly agree (0.8<kp≤1) with S b based
    on the computed weighted kappa kp , are pruned as a redundant copy of S b . Let
    us say, the number of redundant detectors we found in each iteration is 0≤ K ′
    ≤K−1 , and then we remove them from the available K detectors as: K←K− K ′ . We
    repeat this process until K is zero. Algorithm 1: PSCDs( S 1 ,… S K , T 1 ,… T

    2, we have S b = D 1   because the AUC of D 1 is maximum. We then store D 1 in
    B as a base soft detector. Suppose, n k of D1 is equal to four different levels
    ( S≥3; 3>S≥2;2>S≥1; and 1>S≥0 ) of scores S( D 1 ) . First, we have to compute
    the contingency and weighted matrices between base ( S b = D 1  ) and each of
    the rest two ( K←K− S b ) soft detectors D 2 and D 3 . Fig. 2(b) shows the contingency
    tables ( C 4×4 ) for four different levels. Since the dimension of the contingency
    and weighted matrices are the same, we put them together, where, each cell c ij
    (#_#_ w ij ) in Fig. 2(b) represents three values: The first and second values
    represent the number of samples agreed at levels i and j of the two contingency
    tables between D 1 and D 2 and between D 1 and D 3, respectively. The third value
    is the linear weight computed using ( 4). Based on the contingency and weighted
    matrices between two detectors, we can compute the weighted kappa ( kp ) coefficients
    using ( 5). The weighted kappa KP between D 1 and D 2 is 1, meaning that both
    are in perfect agreement (i.e., kp ∈0.8<kp≤1 ) at the same level for every instances,
    and thus D 2 should be pruned (lines 15–18 in Algorithm 1). However, the weighted
    kappa kp between D 1 and D 3 is 45.65 , meaning poor agreement (i.e., kp∉0.8<kp≤1
    ) at the same level for every instances, and therefore D 3 is more likely to diverse
    from D 1 and should be selected for combination. At the end of the first iteration,
    we only keep D 3 (i.e., K=1 ), while D 2 is pruned because it is redundant of
    the base detector D 1 . The final results of this phase consist of two diverse
    base soft detectors D 1 and D 3 . The diversities at the response level for four
    different thresholds are presented in Fig. 2(c). We can see that the responses
    of the two selected base soft detectors D 1 and D 3 diverse at various instances
    [see Fig. 2(c)] for all threshold points, except for S≥0 . In Fig. 3(a), we show
    a more realistic example, using the ADFA-LD dataset with 20 soft HMM detectors.
    In this figure, we have eight base soft diverse detectors (green solid ROC curves)
    and 12 pruned redundant soft detectors (black dotted ROC curves). Similarly, Fig.
    3(b) shows the experiment on CANALI-WD dataset, where we have only three base
    soft diverse detectors and 17 pruned redundant soft detectors. At the end of Phase1,
    all the selected base soft diverse detectors L≪K (stored in B) are then fed into
    Phase2 of Algorithm 1. Fig. 3. Example of selected base soft detectors (green
    solid lines) with pruning redundant soft detectors (doted black lines) under the
    ROC space using weighted kappa ( Phase1 in Algorithm 1) on ADFA-LD dataset (a)
    and CANALI-WD dataset (b). Show All Phase2-Pruning using unweighted kappa: The
    second phase of Algorithm 1 leverages the MinMax−Kappa pruning method [45], one
    of the two pruning methods of PBC using unweighted kappa, to select the complementary
    crisp detectors. Since the base soft detectors selected in Phase1 are diverse,
    we apply the MinMax−Kappa pruning method on each base soft detector individually
    instead of brute-force search like in PBC. We compute the unweighted kappa coefficient
    kp between a base soft detector''s decision vector (or crisp detector) and the
    true decision labels (or ground truth), same as in PBC. If n b is the number of
    decision levels on a base detector''s scores vector S b , then we obtain n b crisp
    detectors. Now, we compute unweighted kappa coefficients of n b crisp detectors
    and sorted them in ascending order. According to MinMax−Kappa , the accurate crisp
    detectors should reside close to kp≈k p max and their complementary crisp detectors
    should reside close to kp≈ kp min . However, we have to set the number of crisp
    detectors and the ratio of them to be selected close to kp max and kp min . We
    set the ratio 50%, same as in MinMax−Kappa . Moreover, before selecting the complementary
    crisp detectors, we have to filter out the trivial crisp detectors (giving always
    either positive or negative responses) whose kp is close to zero. In the running
    example shown in Fig. 2, Phase2 selects two diverse base soft detectors D 1 and
    D 3 with four different thresholds. Therefore, each base soft detector produces
    four crisp detectors at four different levels or thresholds. The responses R(D(S)≥θ)
    of each crisp detector for 25 instances and their corresponding true labels (ground
    truth) are shown in Fig. 2(c). Fig. 2(d) shows the unweighted kappa values sorted
    in ascending order for each crisp detector of two base soft detectors D 1 and
    D 3 . Consider a ratio of 50% and the number of crisp detectors to be selected
    to be two. Therefore, from Fig. 2(d), we obtain, kp max ≈0.62 and kp min ≈0 for
    D 1 . Similarly, for D 3 , kp max ≈0.59 and kp min ≈0 . However, the trivial crisp
    detectors [one for D 1 : R(S≥0) ; and two for D 3 : R(S≥1) and R(S≥0) ] should
    be filtered out first. Fig. 2(d) shows the filtered trivial crisp detectors (large
    diagonal marker with cross sign). Since the ratio is 50%, from each base soft
    detector, one crisp detector should be selected close to kp max , and another
    one should be selected close to kp min . Fig. 2(d) shows the four selected complementary
    crisp detectors (two from each base soft detector, marked with large circle marker).
    In general, if the number of selected complementary crisp detectors from a selected
    base soft detector is m (i.e., m/2 close to kp max and m/2 close to kp min ),
    then the total number of selected crisp detectors will be M=m∗L , where L is number
    of selected base soft detectors (selected from Phase1). We tested m with different
    setting ( l=4,8,12,16 , and 20) and obtained best results for m=12 . In Fig. 4,
    we show a more realistic example using ADFA-LD dataset. In this figure, we have
    M complementary crisp detectors (red bold points) selected from L diverse base
    soft detectors (selected in Phase1) using unweighted kappa-based MinMax-Kappa
    pruning technique. Fig. 4(a) shows the results under the space of kp−fpr , and
    Fig. 4(b) shows the results under the space of kp − tpr. Fig. 5 also shows the
    selected total M=96 complementary crisp detectors from the L=8 diverse base soft
    detectors under the ROC space. Fig. 4. Example of selected complementary crisp

    L base soft detectors (selected by Phase1 in Algorithm 1) using MinMax−Kappa pruning
    technique ( Phase2 in Algorithm 1) on ADFA-LD dataset. Show All Fig. 5. Example

    L base soft detectors (selected by Phase1 in Algorithm 1) using MinMax−Kappa pruning
    technique ( Phase2 in Algorithm 1) on ADFA-LD dataset. Show All Phase3-Boolean
    combination techniques: The third phase combines the selected complementary crisp
    detectors using Boolean functions. The first combination approach called WPBC2,
    shown in Algorithm 2, combines all possible pairs of complementary crisp detectors
    (selected from Phase1 and Phase2) same as in BBC2. In contrast with BBC2, WPBC2
    fuses only the complementary crisp detectors instead of using brute-force (i.e.,
    all available crisp detectors). The second approach called WPIBC, shown in Algorithm
    3, combines the complementary crisp detectors of each diverse base soft detectors
    sequentially same as in IBC. The difference is that WPIBC only combines the most
    diverse base soft detectors after pruning all the redundant soft detectors. As
    we will show in the evaluation section, both WPBC2 and WPIBC Boolean combination
    approaches, using only M≪N complementary crisp detectors of L≪K diverse base soft
    detectors, improved the true positive rate when the false tolerance is almost
    close to zero. Algorithm 2: WPBC2( S 1 ,… S K , T 1 ,… T K ,lab) : Weighted Pruning

    ROCC H iter and R iter B. Complexity Analysis Suppose, we have K soft detectors
    with S k {k=1…K} scores using a validation set V . Let the number of decision
    thresholds on the scores S k of each soft detector be constant, and the size be
    T . Let N=K∗T be the total number of crisp detectors. The brute-force search for
    optimal combination is infeasible in practice due to the doubly exponential combinations.
    In fact, for N crisp detectors there are 2 N possible outcomes that can be combined
    in 2 2 N ways, which makes the brute-force combination impractical even for small
    N values [1], [43]. The worst case time complexities of the proposed and existing
    Boolean combination methods are given in Table II. The pair-wise combination of
    N crisp detectors employed in BBC2, which requires O( N 2 ) Boolean operations,
    may not be feasible in practice for large N values. The sequential combination
    of the IBC algorithm reduces its worst case time complexity to O( T 2 +N) Boolean
    operations. TABLE II Worst Case Time Complexity of Pruning and Without Pruning-Based
    Boolean Combination Methods Our recent pruning approach [43] used the kappa-error
    diagrams or simply called unweighted kappa coefficient to decide which ensemble
    members can be pruned with maintaining a similar overall accuracy. Although PBC
    reduces the impractical exponential computation time for BBC2 to O(N(logN+1))
    , the performance at low false alarm values is also decreased (details in Section
    VI). This is because PBC selects U≪N complementary crisp detectors over the whole
    N converted crisp detectors, it cannot consider the diversity among the individual
    soft detectors. The proposed pruning technique is more general as it ensures the
    diversity among both of the individual soft and crisp detectors instead of using
    N crisp detectors. As shown above, the total number of crisp detectors N depends
    on two important parameters K and T . Phase1 in the proposed weighted pruning
    technique reduces the size of the ensemble from K to L diverse soft detectors,
    by pruning the redundant ones. As shown in Fig. 3(a), out of K=20 soft HMM detectors,
    Phase1 selects only L=8HMMs for ADFA-LD dataset and only L=3HMMs for CANALI-LD
    dataset [see Fig. 3(b)]. Then, Phase2 optimizes the size of T of each selected
    base diverse soft detector (L) to m<<T by pruning all the trivial and redundant
    crisp detectors. Here, m is a user defined parameter and set based on the experimental
    results using validation set (e.g., in this experiment, m=12 gives the best result
    for both datasets). At the end, the proposed pruning methods always select M=L∗m
    complementary crisp detectors. Therefore, the worst case time complexity required
    by the proposed pruning technique to select M complementary crisp detectors is
    O( K 2 +K∗(T(logT+1))) , where, Phase1 requires about K 2 operations for computing
    and sorting the AUC and the weighted kappa of K soft detectors, in order to select
    L diverse base soft detectors. In Phase2, each base diverse soft detector ( L
    ) requires about T(logT+1) operations for computing and sorting the unweighted
    kappa for T crisp detectors, in order to select m≪T complementary crisp detectors.
    Therefore, in the case of worst case, Phase1 selects all K soft detectors (i.e.,
    L=K ). So, the worst case time complexity for Phase2 requires about (K∗(T(logT+1)))
    operations, in order to select a total of M=K∗m complementary crisp detectors.
    At the end of pruning Phases, Phase3 combines the decisions of M complementary
    crisp detectors. In Phase3, the worst case time complexity for the proposed WPBC2
    is about O( M 2 ) Boolean operations, and for the proposed WPIBC is about O( m
    2 +M) Boolean operations, where M≪N and m≪T . SECTION VI. Experiments and Comparison
    We experimented with the proposed pruning approach on two system call datasets:
    ADFA-LD [6] and CANALI-WD [47]. The experimental results are compared with BBC2
    [1] and IBC [21] without pruning. We also compared our approach to PBC that we
    proposed in previous work [43]. ADFA-LD dataset: ADFA-LD consists of normal and
    anomalous sequences of system calls collected from Ubuntu [6]. A normal sequence
    of system calls of a process is collected from the system call traces while it
    is executed under the normal conditions. An anomalous sequence of system calls
    of an attack is collected from the system call traces while it is executed against
    the system. There are in total 5206 normal traces collected from various normal
    Unix-based processes such as web browsing and Latex document preparations. The
    dataset contains 60 attack traces by exercising six different types of attacks:
    web-based exploitation, simulated social engineering, poisoned executable, remotely
    triggered vulnerabilities, remote password brute-force attacks, and system manipulation.
    In training, we use the 833 normal traces same as in [6] to train the 20 discrete-time
    ergodic HMMs (i.e., K = 20 soft detectors) with various values. The rest of the
    4373 normal traces and the 60 anomalous traces are used for evaluation. CANALI-WD
    dataset: CANALI-WD consists of two normal datasets called goodware and anubis-good
    and two malware datasets called malware and malware-test [47]. The goodware dataset
    contains a massive amount of 180 GB execution traces of normal day-to-day operations,
    which are collected from ten different machines. The anubis-good dataset contains
    the traces of 36 benign applications executed under anubis [61]. The malware dataset
    is a collection of execution traces of 6000 malware samples including a mix of
    all the existing categories (botnets, worms, dropper, Trojan horses, etc.), which
    are randomly extracted from anubis [61]. The final malware-test dataset is a collection
    of execution traces of 1200 malware samples, which are collected from a different
    machine than the normal ones used for anubis. In training, we use the anubis-good
    dataset and the traces for nine out of ten machines in the goodware dataset (same
    as in [47]) to train 20 soft HMMs detectors with various values. In contrast to
    [47], however, where the malware dataset was also used to train the models, we
    only use malware for testing. This is because an anomaly detector mainly models
    the normal behavior of a system. Therefore, the rest of the 23 traces of the tenth
    machine in the goodware dataset, 5855 traces from malware dataset, and 1133 traces
    from malware-test dataset are used for evaluation. A. Experimental Setup We use
    a stratified fivefold cross validation (5FCV) technique, same as in [43] , on
    the testing set for the evaluation of the proposed pruning approach. Since the
    ratio between the normal and anomalous traces in both datasets is not balanced,
    we applied stratified 5FCV to partition the normal and anomalous sets separately.
    This is because we want to keep the same ratio (normal to anomalous) to guarantee
    that all folds include the normal and anomalies traces. Therefore, for ADFA-LD
    dataset, each fold contains 874 traces selected randomly from the 4373 normal
    traces and 12 attacks traces selected randomly from the 60 attack traces. Similarly,
    for CANALI-WD dataset, each fold contains four traces selected randomly from the
    23 normal traces and 1397 traces selected randomly from the 6988 anomalous traces.
    However, as we followed the same setting as in PBC [43] instead the way of standard
    cross validation, we also used one fold for validation and the remaining four
    folds for testing on the both ADFA-LD and CANALI-WD datasets. As described in
    Section III, we apply the BW algorithm on the validation set to learn the parameters
    of an HMM with setting the random initialization of A, B, and π , and M=340 distinct
    system call symbols for ADFA-LD dataset and M=89 distinct symbols for CANALI-WD
    dataset. Since a single HMM with a predefined number of states N may have limited
    chances to fit the underlying structure of the data (as noted in Section III),
    20 different discrete-time ergodic HMMs (i.e., 20 soft detectors) are trained
    with various N=10, 20…200 values. For each state value N , we repeated the training
    process ten times with a different random initialization of A, B, and π to avoid
    the local minima, and the HMM that gives the highest AUC value on the validation
    set is selected for Boolean combination. B. Results and Comparison We mainly focus
    on how the proposed pruning-based Boolean combination approaches can reduce the
    computation time (as discussed in Section V) of the BBC2 and IBC techniques while
    maintaining or improving the detection accuracy and reducing the false alarm rate.
    Figs. 6 and 7 show the AUC results in the ROC space for the proposed weighted
    pruning techniques on ADFA-LD and CANALI-WD datasets. We can see that the ROC
    curve of the proposed pruning-based WPIBC shows slightly better AUC than IBC.
    In particularly, WPIBC is able to ensure the diversity among the fused crisp detectors
    (selected using unweighted kappa at Phase2 in Algorithm 1) where each crisp detector
    comes from the selected diverse base soft detectors (selected using weighted kappa
    at Phase1 in Algorithm 1). Therefore, in contrast to IBC, where the order of combination
    responses in each iteration is the order of all the available soft and crisps
    detectors, WPIBC maintains the order of combination responses in each iteration
    among the selected diverse soft and crisp detectors (see details in Algorithms
    1 and 3). For instance, to achieve the final operating points denoted in Fig.
    6 with a large pink circle, WPIBC uses only five selected complementary crisp
    detectors (red bold plus marker points) and four Boolean operations, whereas IBC
    uses 17 crisp detectors (black bold circle marker points) and 16 Boolean operations.

    and four folds are used for testing. Show All Fig. 7. Algorithm comparisons on

    for testing. Show All Compared to BBC2, although the AUC of WPBC2 is slightly
    low, WPBC2 maintains the same AUC of PBC shown in Figs. 6 and 7. However, WPBC2
    overcomes the exponential time complexity problem of BBC2 by pruning the redundant
    and trivial crisp detectors, in fact, without pruning, BBC2''s time complexity
    is exponential with respect to the number of detectors (N ^2) [1], [43]. Table
    III shows the maximum detection accuracy (tpr) achieved by each technique for
    a fixed (almost close to zero) fpr value of 0.002, all values are averaged over
    the 5FCV. TABLE III Average (avg), Maximum (max), and Minimum (min) AUC Values
    and True Positive Rate (tpr) With False Positive Rate (fpr)<=0.002 , and Their
    Standard Deviations (std) Over the 5FCV (Train on One Fold and Tested on Four
    Folds) For ADFA-LD dataset, although the AUC values of all pruning methods are
    almost equal, the tpr of PBC with MinMax-Kappa pruning technique is the worst.
    The tpr of WPIBC is almost equal to that of BBC2 method and slightly better than
    that of IBC method. Moreover, the standard deviation of WPIBC is also good as
    compared to the other methods. For the CANALI-WD dataset, the tpr of WPIBC is
    still better than PBC and WPBC2 pruning techniques, and almost equal to BBC2 and
    IBC that do not use pruning techniques. Through this analysis, we observed that
    when the proposed weighted pruning technique combines the selected complementary
    crisp detectors iteratively (i.e., called WPIBC), it achieves similar results
    to that of IBC. Particularly, when we compared the results with the tpr , where
    the maximum fpr is almost equal to zero (0.002), both WPIBC and WPBC2 outperform
    PBC. The results demonstrate that the proposed pruning approach is more general
    and applicable to either pair-wise Boolean combinations (WPBC2) and iterative
    Boolean combinations (WPIBC). Moreover, we tested the proposed pruning approach
    by using the standard way of 5FCV, i.e., four folds are used in validation, and
    one fold is used in testing. With this setting, the results of one fold of 5FCV
    are demonstrated in Fig. 8 for ADFA-LD dataset and in Fig. 9 for CANALI-WD dataset.
    Table IV shows the average results over the 5FCV with this standard setting of
    5FCV. From Figs. 8 and 9, we can see that for both datasets our proposed pruning-based
    Boolean combination approaches are able to achieve the same performance (in terms
    of AUC, fpr , and tpr ), while reducing the time complexity, the number of crisp
    detectors, and the number of Boolean combinations. For CANALI-WD dataset, we got
    almost equal results with the original approaches (which use all crisp detectors)
    and the highest value of tpr=0.91 when the false alarm rate is zero, given in
    Table IV. However, for ADFA-LD dataset, we observed a great difference between
    the proposed pruning approach and the PBC. When the average tpr=0.49 for WPIBC
    (with the limit of maximum fpr is equal to 0.002), it is equal to zero for PBC
    and 0.17 for WPBC2. For example, from Fig. 8, we got tpr=0.51 (when fpr<=0.002
    ) for WPIBC, it is still zero for PBC. Fig. 8. Algorithm comparisons on ADFA-LD

    Table V shows the cost, i.e., the combination time and the number of Boolean operations
    that are required by each method during the validation and testing phases. The
    values are averaged over the 5FCV on the ADFA-LD dataset. All 5FCV executions
    are performed on a 3.1 GHz Intel Core i7 CPU machine with 16 GB of RAM and a 17×5400
    r/ min hard disk. TABLE V Cost Analysis (Values are Averaged Over 5 FCV) in Terms
    of Pruning and Combination Time (s), and Number of Boolean Operations Applied
    During Validation Phase, and the Number of Combined Crisp Detectors Required to
    Achieve Each Vertex on ROCCH During Testing Phase We can see that although the
    pruning time of the proposed approach is slightly more than the PBC, WPIBC reduced
    the combination time and the number of Boolean operations to almost half compared
    to IBC. The total computation time, including pruning and combination during validation
    of WPIBC, was 7.9 s, whereas PBC took 16.6 s. Furthermore, in testing, WPIBC also
    reduced the number of combined crisp detectors by almost half than the number
    required by IBC (5 instead of 11). We can see in Fig. 6 that WPIBC requires on
    average five crisp detectors, whereas IBC requires 11 crisp detectors to achieve
    a single point on the final composite ROCCH. Similarly, WPBC2 always requires
    only two crisp detectors similar to BBC2 and PBC to achieve a single point on
    the final ROCCH. Therefore, the proposed pruning approach is more general, and
    it can be applicable to both pair-wise and IBC s. However, based on the computation
    time and the number of combined Boolean operations, WPIBC is more desirable in
    order to obtain better accuracy while reducing the false alarm rates (as shown
    in Tables III and IV). From the worst case time complexity given in Table II,
    we can see that the proposed pruning approach reduces the total number of crisp
    detectors, i.e., N=K∗T by optimizing two important parameters of K and T in Phase1
    and Phase2, respectively. For example, Phase1 of the proposed weighted pruning
    approach selects only L=3 diverse ensembles of HMM soft detectors out of K=20HMM
    soft detectors [shown in Fig. 3(b) ] for CANALI-WD dataset. As a result, Phase2
    computes the unweighted kappa only for about 300 (i.e., L∗T and let say T=100
    ) crisp detectors, in order to select only M=36 (i.e., M=L∗m , where m=12 ) complementary
    crisp detectors. Whereas PBC always computes the unweighted kappa for about N=2000
    (i.e.,  N=K∗T ) crisp detectors, in order to select U=50 complementary crisp detectors.
    Moreover, since PBC cannot ensure the diversity among the ensembles of soft HMM
    detectors, the probability of selecting the redundant complementary crisp detectors
    or rejecting the other diverse crisp detectors is also high. In fact, it is reported
    in Tables III and IV that PBC significantly reduced the tpr with a low false alarm
    as compared to the other approaches due to the rejection of some diverse complementary
    crisp detectors. SECTION VII. Effects of Weighted Pruning-Based Boolean Combination
    For any ensemble-based Boolean combination algorithms, increasing the accuracy
    is highly dependent on the diversity among the fused soft/crisp detectors (i.e.,
    the level of disagreement among the fused soft/crisp detectors should be high).
    Although the existing ensemble based BBC2 and IBC Boolean combination techniques
    implicitly fused such diverse soft/crisp detectors and showed higher accuracy,
    they face the challenges of computation time and complexity because of fusing
    all the possible pair of crisp detectors from all the available soft detectors
    (as discussed in Sections IV and V; and reported in Table III). In addition, the
    accuracy of IBC is also dependent on the order of combinations. In fact, with
    the increase of number of soft detectors, the computation time and complexity
    increase exponentially for BBC2 and linearly for IBC (discussed in Section IV).
    To be clear, we tested the proposed approach using 50 available soft HMM detectors
    (i.e., on average 5000 crisp detectors), trained with various N=5, 10, …,250 values
    on CANALI-WD dataset. The results are shown in Fig. 10 , where the values are
    transformed into a logarithmic scale. It is clear that when we apply the proposed
    weighted pruning approach (top one in Fig. 10), a noticeable improvement can be
    observed in the reduction of the number of Boolean operations. Particularly, WIBC
    significantly reduces the number of Boolean operations as compared to other approaches.
    For example, BBC2 requires 25 million (7.4 in logarithmic scale) Boolean operations
    for 50 soft detectors, whereas, WPBC2 uses only 3600 (3.4) operations. Similarly,
    when IBC requires 15 000 (4.2 in logarithmic scale) Boolean operations, WIBC uses
    only 204 (2.3) operations. As a result, we can state that WPBC2 is 6944 times
    faster than BBC2 and WPIBC is 73 times faster than IBC for 50 soft detectors.
    Moreover, from the 30 soft detectors, WPBC2 and WIBC always select five diverse
    soft detectors with the increase of the number of soft detectors, and thus, reach
    a constant number of Boolean operations. Fig. 10. Algorithm''s computation time
    and complexity analysis on the validation subset of CANALI-WD dataset. Show All
    The bottom part of Fig. 10 compares the computation time (including pruning and
    combination time together for pruning-based approaches). We can see that WPBC2
    and WIBC reported the lowest computation times as compared to other approaches.
    For example, WPBC2 is 10 000 times (seconds) faster than BBC2, and WPIBC is two
    times faster than IBC during validation phase using 50 available soft detectors.
    Moreover, from the 30 soft detectors, although the pruning time for WPBC2 and
    WIBC increases slightly with the increase of number of soft detectors, the combination
    time remains same as both are always using only five selected diverse soft detectors.
    Compared to PBC pruning approach where both the pruning and combination time are
    increasing linearly with the increase of number of soft detectors. In fact, PBC
    shows worst result when the false alarm is almost zero for both ADFA-LD and CANALI-WD
    datasets (given in Tables III and IV). On the other hand, the accuracy with almost
    zero false alarm is the desired expected solution for deploying a ADS in a real
    world application. The reason is that PBC also uses all the available soft detectors
    to select a subset of complementary crisp detectors without ensuring the diversities
    among the use of soft detectors. As a result, the redundant soft detectors produces
    redundant crisp detectors, and thus it increases the probability of selecting
    these redundant copies if anyone is selected as a complementary crisp detector
    by MinMax-Kappa pruning technique of PBC. The proposed WPBC2 and WPIBC weighted
    pruning techniques select the most diverse base soft detectors from the available
    soft detectors using weighted kappa. For instance, from the Fig. 3(a) , eight
    diverse base soft detectors are selected while 12 are pruned as for redundant
    copies for ADFA-LD dataset. Similarly, from the Fig. 3(b), only three diverse
    base soft detectors are selected while 17 are pruned for CANALI-WD dataset. As
    the selected base soft detectors are diverse, the converted crisp detectors from
    them might also be diverse as well. Therefore, when we apply the MinMax-Kappa
    pruning technique on each selected diverse base soft detectors individually, there
    is no chance for the selection of redundant complementary crisp detectors. As
    a result, our proposed pruning technique shows better accuracy when the false
    alarm is close to zero, compared to PBC for both datasets (given in Tables III
    and IV). Moreover, the proposed weighted based pruning approach is more general
    as we can combine the selected diverse soft/crisp detectors either pair-wise or
    iteratively same as in BBC2 or IBC Boolean combination techniques. Although the
    proposed approach is experimentally validated only on HIDS using system call data,
    it can be applied in other application domains particularly, where one model does
    not formulate the complex normal behaviors of a system. In that case, we can train
    ensemble detectors with considering various normal behaviors. Then, the proposed
    method may be a good one for pruning and combining the multiple detector''s decisions.
    For example, detecting programming errors (i.e., software bugs) and root causes
    in a complex computer programming system [64], [65]. Fosdick and Osterweil [66]
    reported that a computer program is strongly related to the computation patterns
    of input data and, thus, useful for detecting the data flow anomalies. The sequences
    of operations, i.e., the flows of data are assumed to be consistent and used to
    model ensembles classifiers. A social or cultural event or road accident can also
    be detected using sensor and user (e.g., users of twitter, Facebook, etc.) generated
    data. For example, Pramod et al. [63] trained several linear Markov models by
    segmenting the nonlinear traffic data and used them to detect the city events.
    SECTION VIII. Limitations and Discussion Our approach is limited to ensemble of
    homogeneous soft anomaly detectors (i.e., multiple HMMs). However, the input can
    be ensemble of heterogeneous soft and crisp anomaly detectors (e.g., STIDE [11]
    , SVM [72], etc.). In fact, having different types of detectors should further
    increase the diversity in the ensemble and allow for improved performance [73].
    Heterogenous detectors use different learning techniques and may commit different
    (and potentially complementary) type of errors, which increases the diversity
    in the ensemble. For example, OC-SVM models the normal behavior of a system using
    fixed-size feature vectors instead of sequential features like HMM; STIDE uses
    the Hamming distance, whereas HMM uses likelihood probability as a matching measure.
    To adapt our approach to support heterogeneous detectors, we need to modify Phase1,
    which assumes the same thresholds of a base soft detector, which are the orders
    or levels for the weighted kappa for computing the diversity score. It may be
    more efficient to group them based on each modeling technique. Then, apply the
    Phase1 pruning technique on each group separately. For example, STIDE with various
    sliding window sizes can be used to produce many homogeneous soft detectors [11],
    which can then be fed as input to Phase1. Although the proposed approach significantly
    reduces the Boolean combination time (see Fig. 10) by pruning the number of combined
    soft (K) and crisp detectors (N), the worst case time complexity, particularly,
    for the pruning phases (given in Table II), will be increased exponentially (
    K 2 ) with the increase of K. Therefore, for large values of K, the pruning approach
    may suffer from scalability problems. To address this limitation, we need resort
    to parallel processing techniques and platforms such as the Hadoop ecosystem [74],
    [75]. Moreover, the proposed approach is dependent on the ROC space for pruning
    and combining the decisions of the selected complementary crisp detectors. However,
    here, the used ROC curves are a binary classification problem. Therefore, to extend
    the approach for multiclass classification problems, we need to work with an ROC
    curve for more than two classes, and then adapt the Boolean combination and pruning
    techniques to accommodate multiple classes. SECTION IX. Conclusion The proposed
    effective pruning-based Boolean combination techniques analyze the diversities
    among the available ensemble soft detectors (HMMs) using weighted kappa (measures
    the agreement/disagreement between two soft detectors). Based on the weighted
    kappa coefficients, it selects a best subset of diverse base soft detectors while
    pruned all the redundant soft detectors. Each selected base soft detector is then
    converted into all the possible crisp detectors (at various decision thresholds),
    and then used for selecting a subset of complementary crisp detectors using an
    unweighted kappa-based MinMax-Kappa pruning technique. At the end, we merge all
    the selected complementary crisp detectors and use them for Boolean combinations.
    The experimental evaluation on the two benchmarking ADFA-LD and CANALI-WD system
    call datasets verified the validation of the proposed method. We achieved much
    better results than the recent PBC pruning technique, particularly, when the false
    alarm is almost close to zero. Our future plan is to investigate the proposed
    pruning approach using different diverse detectors and other datasets. Moreover,
    we also want to leverage big data platforms such as Hadoop and the MapReduce programming
    model in order to further improve the performance of our approach, especially
    when used with multiple heterogeneous ensemble soft detectors such as HMMs, One-class
    SVM, STIDE, and so on. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics Footnotes

    of wireless technology resulted in the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT),
    which has recently been extensively improved to make it more convenient for usage
    in present and future real-world based applications. IoT was first introduced
    in 1999 by a member of the Radiofrequency Identification (RFID) business association.
    Then it started to gain attention for real-world applications due to the continued
    rise of electronic devices, cloud computing services, and data analytics [1].
    IoT nodes are sensor adapted pieces of hardware that transmit perceived data over
    the internet. Thus, it is clear that this network system has its roots in several
    conventional technologies, including ubiquitous informatics, embedded systems,
    and sensor networks. In addition to having already provided numerous advantages
    in the environment, transportation, health care and smart homes sectors, it is
    having a particularly significant impact on the industry by enabling more structured,
    controlled, and optimized observation at a lower cost. The Industrial Internet
    of Things (IIoT) helps industries to run more efficiently, resulting in cost reductions
    in capital expenditure (CAPEX) and operating expenses (OPEX) [2]. It refers to
    computer-linked interconnected equipment as well as industrial applications such
    as production and energy management. Fig. 1 depicts how industrial IoT and consumer
    IoT interact to preserve the digital connection with the assistance of an intelligent
    network system for large and small-scale networks. In this context, IoT is active
    in the retail sector, whereas IIoT is associated with the industrial sector, making
    it an essential step in enhancing manufacturers’ operating performance. Download

    Internet of Things and Industrial Internet of Things. Industrial IoT is an advanced
    subtype of IoT that combines networked devices and technologies with mechanization
    applications intended specifically for industrial communication. Previously, most
    industrial wireless technologies were based on ad hoc solutions, but with the
    help of industrial IoT, cost-effective technologies such as WirelessHART and ISA100.11a
    are being created with more adaptability [3]. IIoT is a persuasive concept that
    connects various sensors around us to the internet, opening up wonderful prospects
    for the appreciation of a fantastic way of life [4]. IIoT is now recognized as
    the most ideal approach to achieve production performance as it can combine both
    information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) domains, reducing
    operating costs and greater relevance in machine to machine communication. A cost
    reduction in this scenario can be achieved in industrial applications such as
    the production of industrial equipment and operational energy distribution systems.
    IIoT applications contribute to the formation of Smart Factories, which connect
    all devices embedded with sensors over the internet to enable advanced visibility
    of activities through real-time data access. In industry, IoT environmental monitoring
    helps maintain a healthy work environment by detecting the presence of smoke and
    other contaminants and measuring air and water quality. Information gathered from
    the work environment is relayed through Bluetooth from each cluster to the centralized
    server [4]. Smart grid, industrial automation, smart electricity, and smart communication
    are some of the other IIoT applications that work with enormous amounts of data
    in a timely and efficient manner to increase productivity at a low cost. The opportunities
    created through IIoT, such as improved customer experience, data confidentiality,
    continuous data streaming, increasing GDP, and many others, are assisting industries
    in growing more quickly than they otherwise would. The advent of this technology
    allows industrial equipment or systems to sense and react accordingly to their
    surroundings and other conditions. By 2025, the IIoT is predicted to produce $11
    trillion in annual earnings, with business to business (B2B) solutions responsible
    for 70% of this total [5]. Rather than manual machine operation, machines may
    work and solve mechanical difficulties by altering their modulation approach constantly
    with the assistance of IIoT smart devices. Although numerous IIoT applications
    have been developed recently, the technology is still in its initial phase, therefore,
    the aforementioned issues are to be expected. Previous review studies on IIoT
    have identified several issues with its communication technology without providing
    a thorough explanation of how the challenges might be overcome using IIoT-enabled
    technologies. Also, many studies have focused only on the current application
    and challenges without mentioning the opportunities this technology opens for
    industrial growth and increased consumer satisfaction. This study thus aims to
    provide insights into IIoT-enabled technologies and infrastructure, focusing on
    their importance in driving global industrial growth, their applications, challenges,
    and future recommendations on resolving current issues and opening up new opportunities.
    The specific objectives of the current review include: (i) Identify the present
    state of knowledge in the field to help academics understand IIoT ideas, concepts,
    models, and empirical investigations and the progress accomplished. (ii) Provide
    a complete overview of the state-of-the-art knowledge in the field by synthesizing
    and summarizing the results of relevant studies on IIoT in order to identify recurring
    themes, patterns, and trends. (iii) Identify research gaps and opportunities for
    further study to highlight IIoT''s unresolved questions, unknown areas, and developing
    trends. (iv) Propose potential strategies and approaches for improving the field
    based on the research gaps and evaluating the existing state of knowledge. This
    review will assist industrialists to comprehend the necessity and utilization
    of IIoT technology for an industry''s growth, the establishment of new business
    models, and enhancing market competitiveness. The present work is structured as
    follows: Methodological procedures for conducting the review are outlined in Section
    2. Industry 4.0 and IIoT have been introduced and discussed in Section 3. The
    technologies that enable IIoT have been explored and analyzed in Section 4 so
    that their characteristics, strengths, and shortcomings can be identified. Section
    5 identifies and discusses the challenges and benefits associated with IIoT-enabled
    technologies and applications. This section also includes prospective recommendations
    based on the identified issues. A conclusion is presented based on the complete
    study in the final Section 6. 2. Methodology Using an integrative literature review
    approach, this study explores the industrial IoT enabled technologies associated
    with their applications, challenges, and future directions. High-quality, pertinent
    papers were gathered, screened, and analyzed during this process. Database searches
    were conducted using prominent online resources including Google Scholar and Scopus
    as well as highly regarded academic publishers like Elsevier, Nature, Taylor &
    Francis, Wiley, Sage, Springer, ACS, Frontiers, MDPI, Inderscience, and Frontiers.
    A wide variety of keywords such as “Industrial IoT”, “Industrial Internet of Things”,
    “Applications of industrial IoT”, “Industrial IoT-enabled technologies”, and “Challenges
    of industrial IoT” were used to search for pertinent publications. It was found
    that in recent years, the industrial IoT has garnered considerable attention and
    momentum in a wide range of disciplines as shown in Fig. 2. Download : Download

    publications trends (a) year-wise (b) sector wise. The bibliographies and references
    of the works mentioned above were collected and compiled in order to search for
    more related works. We went through the selected papers'' abstracts, introductions,
    and conclusions, classifying them based on the criteria below: (i) Peer-reviewed
    publications only from reputable websites and publishers were initially considered
    (ii) Papers written by scientists currently working in the field were collected
    (iii) A proper balance between current and previous studies was maintained in
    the collected papers (iv) Commercial websites employing the keywords mentioned
    above were considered (v) The cutting-edge technologies available that are relevant
    to this study were taken into account (vi) Important articles cited in previous
    recent works were retrieved, and a thorough evaluation was conducted of the original
    sources used in the studies. Numerous questions came out about recent works throughout
    the process of our study. In order to answer these questions and improve the review''s
    overall quality, further literature searches and readings were conducted. During
    the literature search, we identified a few crucial phrases to help us defend our
    rationale. Keywords such as “Internet of Things”, “IIoT”, “Industry 4.0”, “Cloud
    computing”, “Fog computing”, “Internet of Things”, “Edge computing”, and “Big
    data analytics” were chosen to facilitate the progress of the investigation. As
    the focus of the investigation improved, the list of keywords was refined. 3.
    Industrial IoT and Industry 4.0 IIoT is considered as the 4th industrial revolution,
    or Industry 4.0, due to its contribution to advancing IoT, the internet of services,
    automation systems, the integration of cyber-physical systems (CPS), cloud computing,
    augmented reality, wireless technologies, concentric computing and more [6]. The
    concept of Industry 4.0 emerged in Germany''s manufacturing industry as part of
    the government''s high-tech growth agenda. Preceding industrial revolutions resulted
    in mechanization (the first industrial revolution, or Industry 1.0), contributed
    to electricity (Industry 2.0), and gave us information technology (Industry 3.0),
    whereas the present industrial revolution (Industry 4.0) is driving digital transformation
    through the advancement of IoT technology. Fig. 3 describes industrial digitalization
    and its transition over time. In short, Industry 4.0 is mainly an evolution of
    digital signal transmission technology based on advanced cyber-physical systems
    (CPS) built for industrial manufacturing processes. Download : Download high-res

    revolutions. The notion of Industry 4.0 is also known as the “Factory of the Future”
    (FoF) or the “Smart Factory” due to the use of smart machines comprised of CPS
    for productivity purposes in the industry. It generates a business ecosystem that
    helps to connect assets, resources, infrastructure, and other commercial strategies
    across various businesses so they can interact and regulate each other in a decentralized
    manner. This industrial revolution has replaced the traditional production system
    with intelligent manufacturing and as a result, national economies are making
    significant progress with the help of high-tech gadgets. In terms of digital transformation,
    Industry 4.0 is a broad concept of industrial growth, whereas IIoT is one of the
    major components used to achieve that progress. As shown in Fig. 4, while Industry
    4.0 aims to solve all industrial networking difficulties and create opportunities
    in the business sectors, IIoT is only one of the major components assisting Industry
    4.0 to reach its goal. According to Pereira et al. [7], because Industry 4.0 has
    shifted from centralized networks to decentralized networks, it cannot function
    without IIoT, which was developed specifically to deploy equipment using decentralized
    intelligence. As a result, it is apparent that IIoT is playing a significant role
    in advanced industrialization as an essential component of Industry 4.0. Download

    Elements of Industry 4.0. 4. Industrial IoT-enabled technologies Digital and physical
    technology are combined in the new industrial landscape, often recognized as Industry
    4.0, to demonstrate flexible, networked processes. Enterprises are utilizing the
    internet and other associated technologies to make fast choices across the supply
    chain and the smart factory. IIoT solutions leverage edge and connected sensors
    to make real-time improvements to manufacturing productivity and product quality.
    The IoT concept is supported by the internet''s globalization, openness, interoperability,
    and socialization. Regardless of whether they are industrial or consumer-oriented,
    IoT systems emphasize the connections between items through physical addresses,
    whereas the industrial internet shows probable future patterns of industries based
    on new technology. Studies should focus on cloud computing, the IoT, and big data
    analytics in the future. Highly effective methods to manage and store massive
    amounts of data are artificial intelligence (AI) and data mining. Fuzzy logic
    and neural networks are used in AI. Data pre-processing, filtering, clustering,
    selection, conversion, and pattern analysis are the steps used in data mining.
    Around 40% of IoT benefits to nearly all industrial applications are found in
    the finding, looking, and exchanging of information and resources [8]. IoT may
    be reduced and controlled while maximizing its value by utilizing real-time data
    and knowledge mining using several technologies (Fig. 5) including data analytics/modeling,
    machine learning, edge, and fog computing, and blockchain. However, it is clear
    that IIoT cannot reach its full potential without ensuring proper security. Download

    Industrial IoT-enabled technologies. 4.1. Cyber physical system The cyber physical
    system (CPS) is one of the fundamental technologies of Industry 4.0 that uses
    embedded intelligent systems in production machinery to connect the manufacturing
    sectors to the real environment [9]. It combines with IoT to link the real world
    of manufacturing with the virtual one. Through the integration of networking,
    computation, and storage, CPS creates smart factories by enabling an interactive
    industrial environment. From this vantage point, smart products are becoming increasingly
    identifiable and trackable. CPSs are automated distributed systems that connect
    communication networks and computing infrastructures with physical reality. They
    differ from conventional embedded systems in that they place a greater emphasis
    on Industry 4.0 device networking. As a result, they comprise a control unit that
    can manage a sensor and an actuator that creates interaction with the physical
    environment. They then process the collected data and exchange it with other applications
    and services via a communication channel. These systems should be stable, dependable,
    secure, and effective during service. For this purpose, one of Industry 4.0’s
    objectives is to offer optimal security support across all CPS network tiers,
    securing sensitive data while ensuring data anonymity. Physical system integration
    is a significant problem since it impacts the system''s qualities, including maintainability,
    functioning, extension, adaptability, and variability [9]. An industrial CPS architecture
    was suggested by Hinojosa-Palafox et al. [10]. The architecture specification
    was established using an attribute-based design technique to collect the parameters
    that ensure the quality of the data and big data management attributes (functional
    requirements) from initiation/planning, manufacturing, and maintenance. These
    components allowed the adoption of an architecture model for data analysis design
    for industrial big data, including prediction and KPI inference. The infrastructure
    is divided into three layers: infrastructure, monitoring, and presentation from
    a functional standpoint. The provision of component deployment, which met all
    functional needs using open-source technologies, was also made available. Prior
    research focuses in particular on guiding principles for a CPS implementation
    technique. Contrary to those recommendations, the industrial data quality/management
    attributes that Hinojosa-Palafox et al. introduced are significant for iCPS analytics.
    However, one potential drawback of this work is the lack of a practical implementation
    of the suggested architecture. Thakur & Kumar Seghal [11] suggested a heterogeneous
    model for a smart cyber-physical system that enables the execution of hybrid process
    dynamics by integrating various electrical, pneumatic, and hydraulic processes.
    The proposed architecture can separate the moving aspects of a process, including
    computation, control, communication, and actuation, from each other in order to
    foresee potential risks and delays in the process. A voltage frequency (VF) island
    with great modulations distinct for each operation is used to distribute computing
    attached cores to various physical operations. Some significant aspects connected
    to the designing of efficient CPS that are explored in the study are the design
    of compensators, estimation and compensation of disturbances, delays of sensors
    and actuators, energy-saving with dynamic (VF) scaling, and the VF island division
    of processing elements utilized for control algorithms. To assess some other domains
    (oil, space, defence, and so on), the suggested study could be expanded by incorporating
    self-perception computation and actuation in the system in both fixed and dynamic
    operations. In order to establish security in industrial CPS, Althobaiti et al.
    [12] provided a revolutionary cognitive computing-based intrusion detection system
    (IDS) technique. Data collection, pre-processing, feature selection, classification,
    and parameter optimization are only a few of the various phases of operation that
    the suggested model includes. Pre-processing is used in the model to eliminate
    data noise. The best subset of features was then chosen by the provided model
    using a feature selection technique based on binary bacterial foraging optimization
    (BBFO). The gated recurrent unit (GRU) algorithm was also used to detect intrusions
    in the industrial CPS context. Finally, the hyperparameter optimization of the
    GRU model was carried out using the Nesterov-accelerate Adaptive Moment Estimation
    optimizer. The suggested model demonstrated notable performance with an accuracy
    of 98.45%. Future industrial CPS security can be increased using lightweight cryptographic
    approaches. Additionally, outlier detection algorithms can eliminate undesired
    samples from the dataset. 4.2. Blockchain technology It is not easy to securely
    share data with all parties participating in an IIoT network. Blockchain technology
    is well suited for IIoT because of its distinctive features including distributed
    attributes, trackability, durability, certainty, tamper resistance, reliability,
    and built-in data origin. Blockchain is a particular sort of data structure that
    implements distributed ledger with Bitcoin and uses public key cryptography to
    facilitate secured peer-to-peer network transactions. Each link in the chain contains
    a reference to the previous link''s hash. The strong advantages of blockchain
    improve IoT security and provide decentralized access to IoT data, increasing
    its potency for revealing fraudulent activity. The primary barrier to the adoption
    of blockchain technology is its inability to scale, which will only become worse
    as the number of IoT gadgets grows. As a result, transaction conflicts may also
    rise. Due to the fact that each blockchain transaction needs approval from every
    sharing node in the network, there will be more transactions than there would
    be with a centralized database system, which results in higher latency. Additionally,
    maintaining hash codes and encryption keys is a laborious operation. An architecture
    based on blockchain was developed by Latif et al. [13] to guarantee reliable and
    secure operations in the industry. The blockchain network was equipped with a
    highly scalable, quick, and energy-effective consensus method called proof of
    authentication, and real-time cryptographic techniques were executed. The architecture
    developed in this study has been the subject of many trials and analyses which
    have demonstrated its usefulness. Finally, the researchers executed the suggested
    design and produced remarkable results for blockchain technology, transforming
    a typical fruit processing facility into a safe and intelligent industrial platform.
    Prior studies concentrated on the storage of sensor data using blockchain technology,
    while this study focused on a number of operations in smart industry systems.
    The study made a significant contribution by introducing lightweight authentication
    and cryptography at the device level, ensuring data security outside blockchain-driven
    networks. Umran et al. [14] built a blockchain method for an application in the
    cement industry. The mechanism requires minimum power usage, is scalable, provides
    high security, and can effectively manage access to vital data produced by sensors
    and actuators. Due to its effectiveness in processing cryptographic algorithms,
    a low-powered ARM Cortex-M processor was used, significantly enhancing the suggested
    architecture''s computational performance. Additionally, the blockchain architecture
    uses proof of authentication as a consensus method in place of proof of work (PoW)
    to guarantee secure authentication, scalability, speed, and energy efficiency.
    According to experimental data, the suggested framework delivers significant security,
    scalability, and optimal efficiency for a digital industrial environment. The
    approach resolved the 51% security issue and Sybil attack that was caused by existing
    consensus algorithms like PoW, PoC, and DPoC. As a result, the study offers a
    security system with low computational complexity and good performance which can
    ensure data communication security between peers in the cement industry context.
    In order to provide security for a company using IIoT with branches spread across
    several nations, Rathee et al. [15] devised a hybrid blockchain system. The approach
    developed was carefully verified against traditional mechanisms with a variety
    of security parameters. The simulation findings showed that the suggested method
    reduced the threat of Proof-of-Stake (DoS)/DDoS, text modification attacks, and
    authentication lag by 94%. This strategy involves distinct clients from different
    zones. Since user data is stored in several places, this may include various security
    threats, such as data leakage in the middle, making false data, and additional
    expenses. 4.3. Fog computing Fog computing is considered an extension of cloud
    computing, making it possible for most commercial apps and operations to interact
    with IoT. Fog computing refers to a situation in which wireless and decentralized
    gadgets interact with a network to carry out required operations in industrial
    applications without the influence of any outside parties. Fog computing is the
    provision of web services using IT infrastructure. The essential parts of the
    computation are the fog nodes which comprise devices that provide storage, processing
    power, and virtual network connectivity. These nodes can be utilized for machine
    learning-driven experiments, system optimizations, and predicting system failure.
    All fog nodes that are situated before the inaccessible hop are always reachable
    and can thus continue to service the local system if the connection fails anywhere
    along the way from the local fog nodes to the remote cloud. For many industrial
    applications, fog computation serves as a link between static and dynamic computation
    environments. Tange et al. [16] undertook research to examine how the emerging
    paradigm of Fog computing may be used to meet the IIoT''s security needs. Fog
    computing, as an emerging computing paradigm, can become a strong tool in securing
    a variety of linked industrial contexts, as demonstrated by the study, which identifies
    an abundance of research prospects in the IIoT security field. The resource management
    using genetic algorithms (GA) and ML technique for maintenance prediction in fog
    computing was presented by Teoh et al. [17]. The FogWorkflowsim simulates the
    time, cost, and energy measurement of GA together with the methods Min-Min, Max-Min,
    FCFS, and Round Robin. Employing real-time observations, the model for maintenance
    prediction is constructed using two classes of logistic regression. The findings
    showed that the technique demonstrated better performance than Min-Min, Max-Min,
    FCFS, and Round Robin on execution time, expense, and energy consumption. In comparison
    to the second-best results, the execution time is 0.48% faster, the cost is 5.43%
    less, and the amount of energy used is 28.10% less. The prediction model has a
    95.1% training accuracy and a 94.5% testing accuracy, respectively. To prevent
    cyberattacks, however, there is a need to provide current industrial security
    communication among the devices, which is not available in the study. Additionally,
    the simulation''s performance metrics may include network latency, bandwidth,
    and jitter. Benomar et al. [18] developed an architecture built on the fog computing
    concept intended for industrial monitoring tasks. A fog layer was developed to
    provide a data aggregation approach dependent on single-valued decomposition.
    The OMNET++ simulator was used to examine the advantages of the suggested approach
    in measuring performance, such as latency and packet delivery rate. A real-life
    case of a distributed monitoring system for an industrial motor was used. Additionally,
    the system employed a variety of security measures at various levels. For industrial
    motors with limited resources, it particularly suggests a novel, lightweight,
    and energy-efficient ciphering approach. The proposed method can be applied in
    the future to more domains that call for actuation and are essential in the industry.
    The fog layer described could be studied as a potential approach for latency reduction
    since this may in fact be significantly time-saving. Quality of experience (QoE)
    based technique for dynamic resource allocation in fog computing was developed
    by Aazam et al. [19], consisting of a mathematical model incorporating a net promoter
    score (NPS), which measures the system''s quality of experience. NPS is a 0–10
    scale used to measure user satisfaction, with a score of 0–6 denoting negative
    feedback, sometimes known as distractors. Users who provide input in this range
    are referred to as passive. A score of 7–8 is considered to be neutral. Users
    that provided 9–10 or more favourable reviews are known as promoters [20]. By
    considering the user''s prior NPS for a certain operation to the total NPS score
    of that specific operation, the suggested methodology calculates a QoE ratio.
    Resources are assigned based on the ratio for the following scenarios: default
    state (no prior NPS), NPS provided by user > total NPS, NPS provided by user <
    total NPS. The ratio for scaling the resources must be based on the QoE given
    by users and is determined by an effective mathematical model that the authors
    proposed. 4.4. Cloud computing High speed computer systems that are highly dispersed
    are required for processing, analysing, and storing the huge amount of data generated
    by IIoT. Technologies for cloud computing offer computation, networking, and storage
    capabilities across all the components of IIoT systems. Backend clouds are directly
    interfaced with all related hardware and software. By introducing cloud computing
    and graphic processing units, rendering and computational power have recently
    significantly increased, and visualization is growing in popularity. In addition,
    IIoT and AI are continually integrating, and 5G and other upcoming technologies
    like VR, AR, and mixed reality (MR) are being used increasingly in the industry,
    education, and medical training. The options for cloud services include private
    (exclusively owned and maintained by a particular authority), public (exclusively
    owned and maintained by cloud suppliers), and hybrid (a mixture of public and
    private). A private cloud is not a realistic choice for newly established and
    small/medium-sized businesses because the setup of data centres and the hiring
    of staff demand considerable investment. However, to secure the safety, security,
    and privacy of their users as well as combat industrial espionage for a competitive
    edge, major and established companies choose the construction of a private cloud.
    In the study conducted by Senthilkumar & Rajesh [21], a deep learning method recurrent
    neural network (RNN) was combined with the model-based engineering (MBE) method
    to govern the flow of tasks in a cloud network. In a cloud computing context,
    RNN predicts future workloads and supplies the necessary resources to maintain
    workflow balance. The whole process of making predictions is predicated on the
    pace of data intake from IIoT devices. The virtual machines in the cloud environment
    handle storing or processing of the input data. Utilizing RNN to improve the process,
    resources are allocated, and task scheduling is done on the control plane. The
    RNN is restarted to complete the optimization job repeatedly. This study creates
    a framework that successfully balances the cloud workflow and data collecting
    pace. Liu et al. [22] developed an immersive VR simulator that is integrated into
    an AR-driven brain tumour neurosurgery remote collaborative virtual surgical teaching
    system. Through 5G transmission, the device allows for real-time remote surgery
    training engagement. The trial to validate the system was open to six specialists
    and 18 beginners. The two simulators were then assessed utilizing techniques for
    face and construction validation. The outcomes of the face and content validation
    showed that the AR simulator was more effective at improving surgical skills than
    the VR simulator regarding vision and scene authentication. The method does, however,
    have significant drawbacks. This work used an external camera to scan and register
    digital pictures before layering real-world scenes and models over them. This
    is distinct from the registration of a virtual representation of a particular
    anatomical structure with the patient''s actual object (segmented MR image reconstruction).
    More complex aspects like blood flow and pulse cannot yet be accurately simulated.
    Using a probabilistic graphical model, an intelligent trust assessment technique
    built on mobile edge computing was presented by Wang et al. [23] to evaluate the
    trustworthiness of sensor nodes thoroughly. The suggested approach analyses data
    and communication behaviour to evaluate the credibility of sensor nodes. Additionally,
    the edge nodes’ movement path is planned to reduce the moving distance and increase
    the likelihood of direct trust evaluation. A performance-verifiable approximation
    method was created. Numerous tests showed that the approach can successfully assure
    the reliability of sensor nodes while reducing energy usage. This strategy can
    efficiently shorten the running time without considerably increasing the moving
    distance. 4.5. Edge computing Using computing, storage, and network sources scattered
    across the channels between data resources and cloud computing hubs, edge computing
    is a new idea that examines and operates data. In order to execute the local processing
    of data sources, make a few quick judgments, and upload computation results or
    pre-processed data to the centre, edge computing utilizes edge devices with sufficient
    computing capability. Edge computing effectively lowers the system''s overall
    latency and the need for bandwidth, and raises the system''s overall performance.
    Uses of edge computing in the smart industry enable businesses to implement effective
    security measures nearby, which mitigates security threats by lowering the likelihood
    of data breaches during communication and the amount of data retained in the cloud
    centre. However, there is an additional cost at the local end even though cloud
    storage costs are low. This is mostly due to the development of storage space
    for edge devices. Edge computing has benefits, but there is also a risk. To prevent
    data loss, the system must be carefully designed and configured before being implemented.
    Many edge computing devices trash useless data after collection, which is appropriate,
    but if the data is useful and is lost, the cloud analysis will be inaccurate.
    The scheduling issue in edge computing was solved by Wu et al. [24] using deep
    reinforcement learning (deep RL) to raise the standard of services offered to
    customers in IIoT applications. They developed a hierarchical scheduling approach
    taking the heterogeneous central-edged computing framework into account. After
    that, a double deep Q network framework-based deep intelligence scheduling algorithm
    (DISA) was suggested to create scheduling decisions for communication in accordance
    with the model''s characteristics. The study used a variety of performance indicators
    to compare DISA with other benchmark systems. The proposed method showed significant
    improvement over the existing approaches in terms of scheduling, latency analysis,
    and bandwidth consumption. Although the running time was improved, there is scope
    for further improvement. For activities requiring delay-responsive computing in
    multi-user IIoT mobile edge computing systems, Deng et al. [25] suggested an autonomous
    partial offloading system in their study. The objective was to offer offloading
    services with little to no delay to improve the quality of services (QoS). This
    method provided two offloading techniques based on RL to automatically improve
    delay performance. To offer a discrete partial offloading decision, firstly the
    Q-learning algorithm was developed. Then the task offloading choices were delivered
    as continuous built-on deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) to optimize the
    system''s performance with more relaxed job offloading. According to the simulation
    results, the Q-learning scheme and the DDPG method both minimize the latency,
    by 30% and 23%, respectively. The algorithm has difficulties due to the regional
    variation in network traffic. In a sophisticated edge computing-driven architecture
    with a service migration function, the issue of computing offloading of IIoT applications
    can be taken into consideration. You & Tang [26] proposed the use of an energy-effective
    and low-delay task offloading technique built on particle swarm optimization (PSO)
    to move work from edge devices with limited resources to edge servers. A suggested
    multi-objective optimization problem considers task execution costs, energy usage,
    and time delay. The cost of offloading all tasks to various MEC servers is represented
    by the particle''s fitness function. Through simulation studies, the genetic algorithm
    (GA) and the simulated annealing algorithm (SA) are put up against the offloading
    technique based on PSO. The experimental findings demonstrated that the PSO-based
    task offloading technique can efficiently achieve suitable resource allocation
    while reducing the MEC server''s lag time and energy consumption. PSO lowers the
    overall cost in terms of energy use by about 12%. The service requirement for
    high reliability was not considered in this study; only the criteria for low latency
    and low energy consumption were considered. 4.6. Big data analytics Massive data
    streams are produced by IIoT systems and devices, necessitating the use of extremely
    complex highly performing computing platforms for big data analysis. The IoT''s
    substantially increased data volumes prevented the usage of traditional data processing
    techniques. The IoT focuses on big data and AI to draw conclusions and make decisions
    from sensory information because there are so many smart things (SThs) and entities
    of interests (EoIs) connected to the cloud. In contrast to typical big data issues,
    IoT big data has unique characteristics. IIoT systems enable many technologies/methods
    for collecting massive data, storing, managing, processing, analysing, and assembling
    multiple big data analytics operations. The technologies for data collecting offer
    connections to a wide range of data sources, sensors, digital devices, and human
    machine interactions in the IIoT system. A massive amount of data may be handled
    close to sensors, edge servers, and in cloud centres by data management and processing
    technology. Data analysis technologies offer a variety of techniques for data
    mining, ML, DL, and statistical analysis across various IIoT system tiers. Communication
    between IIoT gadgets and their surroundings is made possible by actuation technology.
    Technologies to process and analyse big data are a key component of the future
    generation of IIoT systems, notwithstanding their complexity. Ren et al. [27]
    designed and deployed an approach to big data platforms and an intelligent industrial
    IoT sensor monitoring method based on edge computing and AI for the manufacturing
    sector. The IoT sensors gather information inside the industrial production factory
    about environmental conditions like vibration, temperature, etc. Condition data
    is a key component that enables the IIoT to adopt intelligent and scalable manufacturing.
    These condition data are gathered for more in-depth analysis and study, and they
    can alert factory administrators to the upcoming emergence of any fault. Along
    with the alarm mentioned above, the system also includes a prediction analysis
    for the percentage of defective items that the manufacturing machine will create.
    Despite the progress, some security and protection are still lacking. Over a multi-layered
    programmable industrial architecture, Njah & Cheriet [28] developed a technique
    called ROSA (centralized route optimization and service assurance). The suggested
    system carries a variety of heterogeneous flows, including bandwidth-sensitive
    services and ultra-reliable lower-latency communications. The routing optimization
    problems are put forth as shortest path problems with several constraints. The
    problem of NP-hard complexity is resolved using the Lagrangian relaxation method.
    In order to meet QoS recommendations, efficiently allocate limited resources,
    and improve the network''s energy usage, the method deployed a pair of parallel
    routing algorithms that are operated in accordance with the flow type. Compared
    to well-known benchmarks, the output indicated significant efficiency in lowering
    bandwidth usage by 22%, delay by 21%, packet losses by more than 19%, flow interruption
    by roughly 16%, and energy consumption by 4%. The recent studies conducted on
    industrial IoT-enabled technologies are tabulated in Table 1 along with their
    outcomes, applications and weaknesses/strengths. Table 1. Summary of recent studies
    conducted on Industrial IoT enabled technologies. Technologies/architectures Objective

    modification attacks, and authentication lag by 94%. Security in IIoT. User data
    is stored in multiple locations, which poses security risks such data leakage,
    inaccurate data, and extra costs. [14] Fog computing Provide a data aggregation
    approach that depends on single valued decomposition, a fog layer was developed.
    Compared to AES-128, the proposed method consumes significantly less energy (reduced
    by a factor of 3). Industrial monitoring tasks The fog layer described can be
    studied as a potential approach to latency reduction. [17] Provide a quality of

    of the proposed VFL. Privacy in big data. Advanced neural networks and a training
    set with more categorization labels could be studied in the future. [28] 5. Challenges,
    benefits and future directions for industrial IoT The concept of IIoT introduces
    a network of sensors, devices and machineries connected with each other in industrial
    applications, such as automated equipment monitoring and energy management. IIoT
    takes advantage of IoT communications focusing on interoperability between machines
    in these applications. However, IoT services can become inconsistent due to some
    difficulties caused by heterogeneity, dynamicity, and data volume, which are critical
    to industrial applications. Recent studies have shown that enabling different
    techniques, such as data fusion, big data, machine learning, blockchain, cloud
    computing, and fog computing, can result in valuable impacts in this area. Moreover,
    the recent trends in big data analytics (BDA) can lead to the advancement of automated
    and smart IoT-embedded systems in industrial applications. While there are numerous
    benefits to implementing IIoT, there are also drawbacks. As there are a lot of
    devices connected to each other in IIoT and a lot of data needs to be analysed
    in a short amount of time, a lack of proper device maintenance, failure to ensure
    a secure network service or data confidentiality, a lack of individual access
    control policies, the absence of a solution for machine errors, and human errors
    can negatively impact the ability of industries to operate successfully. Many
    researchers claim that skilled labour and user awareness can alleviate these problems
    and create opportunities to address industrial requirements. The innovative taxonomy
    of industrial IoT challenges proposed by Alabadi et al. [29] takes into account
    not only the problems themselves but also the terminology and methods used to
    address them. As reported by the authors, these issues include heterogeneity,
    real-time processing, mobility, resource restrictions, connectivity, and scalability.
    The incorporation of big data and artificial intelligence can make a significant
    impact in different application areas of Industry 4.0. But there are also challenges
    with big data and AI-based technologies in these advanced applications across
    several criteria, such as availability, integrity, interpretability, auditing,
    and security/privacy issues. Furthermore, well-organized industrial infrastructures
    can benefit from decentralized communication in IoT infrastructures, often called
    peer-to-peer (P2P). There also are industrial knowledge graphs (IKG) enabled systems
    that are capable of creating higher value to utilize knowledge as a service rather
    than a resource in IIoT-driven applications with smart manufacturing processes.
    More detailed and in-depth research should be carried out to develop IKG-based
    techniques in the future. 5.1. Real-time performance IoT devices and sensors can
    capture information from different data sources and respond in real-time by utilizing
    big data analytics, blockchain technology, artificial intelligence, and cloud
    and edge computing. They are intelligent enough to automate processes, predict
    failures, and detect security threats in a real-time IoT based system. A monitoring
    system with temperature and humidity sensors can be used to control heating or
    cooling devices remotely in real time. The results from the sensed data can also
    be presented to end users through cloud and Android applications. A real-time
    scheduling strategy can be deployed in an IoT-based smart automated system using
    a microcontroller-driven Arduino board and mobile-enabled application. The strategy
    is quite capable of controlling the system environment with the available switching
    functions and thus can achieve high performance. Additionally, an intelligent
    traffic control scheme and a remote patient monitoring system using an electrocardiogram
    (ECG) can be implemented in real-time as IoT applications. The integration of
    IoT sensors and a big data processing system is more efficient for computing an
    exceptionally large amount of data [30]. The processing of the big data platform
    uses a message queue, a processing engine in real-time, and a database to store
    the sensor data obtained from the industrial and manufacturing process. The experimental
    results found by Syafrudin et al. [30] revealed that the IoT-enabled sensors can
    achieve a satisfactory output by successfully collecting and transmitting the
    data with acceptable latency and low computational cost. Nevertheless, the security
    of IoT based systems and possible unexpected circumstances that occur during the
    automation process should be considered in future research. A distributed system
    for stream processing for IoT-based applications can enhance the quality of service
    by facilitating real-time analysis for IoT applications, which nowadays is very
    crucial to fulfilling the requirements of these applications. A prototype along
    with the integration of a distributed stream processing system with IoT was further
    developed to obtain the achievable best outcome for stream processing. After performing
    an evaluation with peak stream rates from 100k to 1M, their research concluded
    that Apache NiFi is the most acceptable solution for IoT-based applications. However,
    they did not discuss safety/security analysis in this paper due to it being a
    separate and broad research area of IoT based applications. Therefore, their research
    recommended the future exploration of security and prescriptive analytical models
    from different aspects in time-critical applications. 5.2. Energy efficiency Better
    resource management and energy efficiency are two areas where IIoT will continue
    to aid sustainability initiatives. Modern IoT systems incorporate wireless sensors
    that gather data to monitor processes and manage operations in different applications.
    When IoT devices are developed, they have to consider energy efficiency to maintain
    their functionality in the long term. Many research studies focus on optimizing
    the energy consumption of IoT devices and making the system more efficient. There
    are prominent wireless technologies by considering system integrity, energy efficiency,
    communication capability, and security. Energy-constrained nodes in an IoT-based
    system will require maximum energy efficiency across the dynamic ranges of operation
    under different conditions including data rate specifications, battery conditions,
    and the implementation process. Moreover, mixed integer linear programming (MILP)
    utilized in an embedded IoT framework is capable of saving processing power and
    communication power dissipation at an average of 27% and 36%, respectively [31].
    However, there are certain challenges related to energy consumption when fog computing
    is used in a massive IoT network and designing energy-saving techniques for such
    networks should be considered in future research. Future applications of IIoT
    should utilize real-time data insights and automation to improve energy efficiency,
    reduce waste, and increase overall sustainability. IoT envisions a future where
    the sensing, processing, and networking capabilities of a smart environment will
    require little or no human intervention. Energy efficiency is a major concern
    in such smart environments with battery-operated sensors and devices. The introduction
    of 5G networks, with its improved speed, reliability, and reduced latency, will
    have a major impact on the IIoT. The increased number of interconnected IIoT devices
    enables more advanced applications and better real-time data analysis, both of
    which are made possible by the vast device connectivity made possible by 5G. Long
    range wide area network (LoRaWAN) is well-known in IoT-enabled communication networking
    systems along with new trends of IoT applications such as monitoring healthcare,
    building home automation, manufacturing industries and so on. Cheikh et al. [32]
    performed systematic research on important search engines to accurately explain
    LoRaWAN technology and effective energy usage in IoT devices. Specifically, the
    importance of power consumption in LoRaWAN networks was highlighted in this research,
    while emphasizing the specific characteristics of the network that are attributed
    to specific layers. The work also discussed popular issues related to energy efficacy
    at different layers, such as the medium access control layer and the network layer
    of the LoRa standard. This study aimed to provide a review of pioneering research
    and provide insights into optimizing LoRaWAN technology from both a network and
    device perspective. 5.3. Security and safety of industrial IoT devices IIoT networks
    are usually larger in scale compared to a few devices in consumer IoT deployments.
    Security and safety are thus becoming more crucial as the number of IIoT uses
    increases. The increased and dynamic interconnection between IIoT devices makes
    the network architecture more complex. So, it is essential to have a profound
    understanding of the weaknesses to establish security in current consumer IoT.
    It is important to consider the specific requirements from an industry standards
    viewpoint to ensure a secure networked IIoT ecosystem and ensure the coverage
    of the connectivity protocols is specified to meet security and safety standards
    [7]. The wireless ecosystem of IIoT services has been relatively popular with
    industrial-centric features in the current 5G architecture. Different aspects
    of the IIoT-edge-cloud ecosystem, such as transformative technologies, (non) real-time
    offloading, and data analytics were discussed. There are research challenges associated
    with the emerging design trends that must be dealt with in the future to create
    value-centric industrial wireless networks. Protecting sensitive data, preventing
    illegal access, and ensuring the integrity of industrial operations should be
    prioritised in future IIoT systems. Examples include new forms of encryption,
    authentication systems, and even anomaly detection algorithms. Since IoT devices
    are commonly used in different areas, especially in manufacturing, they have become
    the core part of the Industry 4.0 ecosystem. IIoT devices experience exposure
    common to standard IoT devices, such as potentially becoming the origins of cyber
    or physical threats in industrial environments. Jiang et al. [33] presented experimental
    research on the possible threats of a representative device in this area. They
    identified the attack surfaces of an IoT-embedded system with typically used devices
    in this field. An analysis of the security related issues of the current IIoT
    technologies was also performed, whereas the analysis highly emphasized the vulnerability
    of recent production systems. Some possible mitigation strategies to prevent unexpected
    scenarios were recommended in the paper for further research in IIoT. However,
    the major drawbacks of this work were a lack of analysis of the insecure server
    interface, privacy concerns, buffer overflow related defects, and inadequate consideration
    of system security. An effective security strategy is required to secure automatic
    operation and avoid intermediate intrusions in IIoT. Some common considerations
    associated with security requirements in IIoTs are the ensuring of restrictions
    against unlicensed access, or the use of industrial machines and maintaining validity
    and integrity for third party operations. Defending against sabotage attacks that
    cause physical damage is also a major goal for a secure IIoT network. 5.4. Coexistence
    and interoperability Coexistence and interoperability are highly significant for
    verifying that IoT devices or wireless networks are operating accurately in a
    massive IIoT ecosystem. There are different systems or devices that need to access
    and transmit data between one another and, essentially, make use of that data
    in a centralized way. Enabling the coexistence and interoperability of different
    types of devices in a system is important for realizing and examining the full
    potential of the IoT system. These advantages are required extensively in a dense
    environment like an IIoT network. Researchers have been studying time sensitive
    networking (TSN), where supported TSN features from specific devices can perform
    well in a TSN environment. Therefore, ensuring coexistence and interoperability
    is one of the challenges that must be addressed in IIoT technologies in the near
    future. However, along with the opportunities that IoT provides to the industry,
    there are also challenges related to real-time operation, energy consumption,
    coexistence, interoperability, and security. Since the requirements of coexistence
    and interoperability are important characteristics in IoT-facilitated 5G networks,
    the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) is requisite to deal with the
    huge volumes of data created by the massive IoT devices. AI-based methods are
    capable of extracting patterns from the data, making meaningful interpretations
    of it and recommending actions to the end devices. While discussing the existing
    challenges and necessary solutions based on IoT and 5G enabling technologies,
    Javaid et al. [34] focused on the demands for AI in future IoT-based 5G network
    systems. The integration of AI at the fog nodes near the end devices was discussed
    in order to minimize energy dissipation, optimize communication latency, improve
    link capacity, and enhance the security of the overall network. The rapid progress
    of IoT devices, ensuring coexistence and interoperability to handle the massive
    amounts of heterogeneous data generated, has become the most important part of
    developing intelligent applications and services. Pliatsios et al. [35] attempted
    to define the problems related to interoperability in IoT-enabled intelligent
    systems and then discussed the latest developments on this subject. They presented
    the unresolved issues and challenges in this context and proposed a framework
    design that employs different methods to enhance interoperability simultaneously
    at all levels. But the major drawbacks of their proposed framework are that the
    ontologies they created are complex and not interoperable with each other. Further,
    they did not emphasize the ontology tools and solutions that can radically improve
    interoperability levels. Moreover, the drawbacks of IoT systems, including limitations
    of resources, energy consumption, and mobility were not considered in this work.
    Finally, their study discussed some insightful ideas for future research and proposed
    solutions to achieve interoperability that introduces the concept of a “Social
    Network of Things” in IoT systems. The IIoT sector has struggled due to the absence
    of standards and compatibility. Developing and adopting industry-wide standards
    will be prioritized in the future to facilitate easy integration and interoperability
    of various IIoT devices, platforms, and systems. This will make deployment, scaling,
    and communication between parties much simpler. 5.5. Limited research on operational
    technology and ICT convergence According to recent research, IIoT is the outcome
    of a convergence of operational technology (OT) and traditional information and
    communication technologies (ICT). Integrating these two different areas requires
    well-defined and scalable benchmarks and it is also particularly important to
    ensure the security of benchmarks. Otherwise, crucial and valuable operational
    properties can become vulnerable. However, OT has not advanced at the same pace
    as information technology (IT) and there are differences between them. Being aware
    of the differences around technical difficulties and privacy concerns, such as
    the convergence of OT and IT, can be insightful. Further research towards the
    convergence of OT and ICT for process automation have been inspired lately by
    researchers looking into different case scenarios, such as a typical process automation
    factory. There are existing challenges with traditional automation architectures,
    as well as a difference between the existing and future architectures of networking
    systems, which need addressing in future IIoT research. Since IIoT is an emerging
    concept in an automated factory, the factory environment is highly exposed to
    cyber threats and interoperability issues. Dhirani et al. [36] discussed these
    issues in their study regardless of enforcing cybersecurity benchmarks and security
    conventions. Their research also provided insightful guidance on the convergence
    of OT and ICT security architectures with interoperable standards and on mitigating
    the differences between the security standards and controls. Enabling a perception
    of converged cybersecurity benchmarks and reviewing the proper utilization, they
    proposed the necessary directions for securing the heterogeneous production environment,
    dealing with the novel threats associated with cybersecurity, enforcing protection
    at different levels, and providing OT/ICT convergence. This study [36] also provided
    directions to map and implement diverse standards, such as machine-to-machine
    and 5G communication networks, IoT-based ecosystems, cloud and edge computing
    platforms, and mitigating security risks and issues. The challenges faced by IIoT
    and their potential solutions are summarized in Table 2. Table 2. Challenges,
    benefits and potential solutions for IIoT. Challenging issues Issues found in
    Recommendations Potential solutions/remarks Ref. Real-time performance Big data
    processing systems where computing a high volume of data from IoT sensors is required
    The IoT-based sensors can achieve a satisfactory output by collecting and transmitting
    the data with acceptable latency and low computational cost. Introduce a system
    with different sensors that collect accelerometer, gyroscope, temperature, and
    humidity data in real time. [30] IoT-based stream processing Apache NiFi can be
    used as the most acceptable solution for IoT-based applications after performing
    an evaluation with peak stream rates from 100k to 1M. Develop a prototype and
    integrate a distributed stream processing system with IoT for the best stream
    processing results. [37] Controlling IoT-based smart grids and microgrids Standard
    security extensions can increase communication delays, but not beyond the maximum
    suggested standard for monitoring microgrids. Examine three IoT communication
    protocols to evaluate real-time IoT-based communication extensions in an IoT-enabled
    microgrid. [38] Energy efficiency For the placement and resource allocation of
    resources in UAVs The proposed strategy is capable of improving the transmission
    power efficiency of the devices and the altitudes of vehicles using an optimization
    method. Design and modify an algorithm to assign the subchannels of the devices
    in order to mitigate interference effectively. [39] Developing energy-conscious
    massive access for 5G networks and green cellular standards Energy-conscious enormous
    access in 5G networks and beyond cellular standards in quality of service and
    connection should be investigated. Explanation of how power dissipation at the
    MAC layer affects the battery life of devices in an IoT-facilitated system. [40]
    Using LoRaWAN technology in IoT devices where efficient energy consumption should
    be considered The study reviewed pioneering research and drew insightful conclusions
    about optimizing LoRaWAN technology from both the network prospect and the device
    prospect. Popular issues related to energy efficacy at different layers, such
    as the medium access control layer and the network layer of the LoRa standard,
    must be addressed. [32] Security and safety of industrial IoT devices Manufacturing
    processes in Industrial IoT There must be tighter collaborations between academic
    communities and different industries to raise awareness of the problems they face
    and the constraints to consider while deploying IoT solutions in manufacturing
    processes. Identify the challenges posed and the research opportunities concerning
    scalability, interoperability, and dependability, which are key attributes of
    many distributed systems. [41] Industrial IoT Some possible mitigation strategies
    can be considered for further research to prevent unexpected scenarios. Identify
    the attack surfaces of an embedded system with typically used representative devices
    in this field. [33] Industrial IoT where the security aspects are required Existing
    surveys on the available solutions should be analysed for developing security
    strategies for industrial IoTs and explored some open research problems to flesh
    out the security aspects of this domain. Present a taxonomy of solutions, including
    different approaches related to artificial intelligence, against security issues
    in IIoT ecosystems. [42] Coexistence and interoperability Industrial IoT applications
    with the need for coexistence and interoperability Prospective directions for
    future research are recommended to address IIoT related challenges emerging from
    standardization efforts. Focus on the challenges associated with the need for
    coexistence and interoperability. [43] IoT-based 5G networks AI-integrated fog
    nodes near the end devices can be used to minimize energy dissipation, optimize
    communication latency, improve link capacity, and enhance the security of the
    overall network. Provide insights into the future scope and obstacles related
    to the coexistence and interoperability of incorporating AI in the 5G networking
    of the IoT ecosystem. [34] Developing IoT-based networks Future research and proposed
    solutions need to be identified to achieve interoperability that introduces the
    concept of a “Social Network of Things” in IoT systems. Present the unresolved
    concerns and challenges in this context and present a framework that uses several
    ways to promote interoperability simultaneously at all levels. [35] Limited research
    on OT and ICT convergence IoT-based mining industry A complex IIoT framework that
    meets major IIoT standards allows smart mines with interoperable structures, data
    distribution, and real-time mining status visibility. Identify a key challenge
    regarding vertical fragmentation due to the technical variations in different
    systems and devices. [44] OT/IT-based systems A two-layered message-oriented middleware
    (MoM) configuration can be used, where each layer is designed to the specific
    needs of the OT and ICT levels, respectively. Adopting OPC unified architecture
    as the interoperable layer of the devices and the systems is the most suitable
    approach to achieve the requirements of high-quality services at the OT layer.
    [45] In conclusion, IIoT is a rapidly developing field with numerous prospective
    future directions and developments. Some of the most promising future applications
    of IIoT include edge computing, AI integration, enhanced security measures, standardization
    and interoperability, 5G and connectivity advancements, digital twins and simulation,
    sustainability and energy efficiency, advanced analytics and predictive maintenance.
    For instance, AI technologies, including machine learning and deep learning will
    be essential in the development of IIoT in the future. Data collected by IIoT
    devices can be analysed by AI algorithms to detect anomalies, identify patterns,
    and make insightful predictions. By integrating IIoT with AI, companies may gain
    useful information, optimize techniques, and enhance their operational efficiency.
    Massive volumes of data are produced by IIoT systems, which can be used for analytics
    and predictive servicing. Businesses can identify trends, predict failures of
    equipment, and schedule maintenance with the help of modern analytics methods
    like predictive modeling and machine learning. By taking these measures, downtime
    and maintenance costs can be reduced significantly. 6. Conclusion As a result
    of the benefits IIoT offers, it rapidly became an essential component of the Industry
    4.0 revolution. This research provided a complete overview of the challenges and
    opportunities offered by IIoT-enabled technology and applications for industrial
    growth. The review aimed to contribute to future studies by describing several
    IIoT applications across several fields. Insights from previous IIoT-related research
    have also been summarized to aid in understanding the progress IIoT has made until
    now. The observations of this study have led to major findings, such as: ■ IIoT
    technology has been developed to interconnect all industrial equipment, monitoring,
    and regulating systems, bodily processes, and mechanical controls. These allow
    manufacturers to work more effectively while reducing errors. ■ Although there
    are certain hurdles to utilizing this technology, large industries’ success is
    highly reliant on well-designed IIoT infrastructure. Working efficiently without
    IIoT during the present industrial revolution is therefore unfeasible. ■ A blockchain
    based security framework for the cement industry resolved the 51% security issue
    and Sybil attack that was caused by existing consensus algorithms like PoW, and
    PoC. ■ Fog computing can lower the time spent looking for parking; the platform
    saved time, fuel, and CO2 emissions. ■ Cognitive computing-based intrusion detection
    demonstrated notable performance with an accuracy of 98.45%. ■ A multi-intelligent
    system for water management can save up to 60% of water. ■ A knn-AHP ensemble
    model was performed with 94% accuracy to ensure smart lighting based on environmental
    factors in green buildings. It is essential to do additional research to resolve
    the existing challenges of this technology, as industrial manufacturing processes
    cannot run smoothly without a well-designed network infrastructure. A more advanced
    form of industrial IoT infrastructure is expected to contribute to industrial
    technological advancement in the near future through continuous innovation and
    experimentation. Conflict of interest No authors have disclosed any conflicts

  explanation: The paper you provided explores the use of automated systems for real-time
    irrigation management in agriculture utilizing IoT and machine learning technologies.
    The paper's relevance to the outline is that it demonstrates how IoT can be incorporated
    into existing irrigation infrastructure to enhance water management practices.
  extract_1: This paper presents the design and development of an IoT-based Smart
    Irrigation System (SIS) for precision agriculture applications. The proposed SIS
    consists of a wireless sensor network (WSN) for data collection, a cloud-based
    server for data processing and storage, and a mobile application for user interface.
    The WSN consists of soil moisture sensors, temperature sensors, and humidity sensors,
    which are deployed in the field to collect real-time data on soil conditions.
  extract_2: The collected data is then transmitted to the cloud-based server for
    processing and storage. The server processes the data to estimate the crop water
    requirement and generates irrigation schedules. The irrigation schedules are then
    sent to the mobile application, which provides a user-friendly interface for farmers
    to monitor the system and control the irrigation process.

    \ introduced as a recently developed technology in the\ntelecommunications ﬁeld.\
    \ It is a network made up of real-world objects, things, and gadgets that\nare\
    \ enabled by sensors and software that can communicate data with one another.\
    \ Systems for\nmonitoring gather, exchange, and process video and image data captured\
    \ by sensors and cameras\nacross a network. Furthermore, the novel concept of\
    \ Digital Twin offers new opportunities so that new\nproposed systems can work\
    \ virtually, but without differing in operation from a “real” system. This\npaper\
    \ is a meticulous survey of the IoT and monitoring systems to illustrate how their\
    \ combination\nwill improve certain types of the Monitoring systems of Healthcare–IoT\
    \ in the Cloud. To achieve this\ngoal, we discuss the characteristics of the IoT\
    \ that improve the use of the types of monitoring systems\nover a Multimedia Transmission\
    \ System in the Cloud. The paper also discusses some technical\nchallenges of\
    \ Multimedia in IoT, based on Healthcare data. Finally, it shows how the Mobile\
    \ Cloud\nComputing (MCC) technology, settled as base technology, enhances the\
    \ functionality of the IoT and\nhas an impact on various types of monitoring technology,\
    \ and also it proposes an algorithm approach\nto transmitting and processing video/image\
    \ data through a Cloud-based Monitoring system. To\ngather pertinent data about\
    \ the validity of our proposal in a more safe and useful way, we have\nimplemented\
    \ our proposal in a Digital Twin scenario of a Smart Healthcare system. The operation\n\
    of the suggested scenario as a Digital Twin scenario offers a more sustainable\
    \ and energy-efﬁcient\nsystem and experimental ﬁndings ultimately demonstrate\
    \ that the proposed system is more reliable\nand secure. Experimental results\
    \ show the impact of our proposed model depicts the efﬁciency of\nthe usage of\
    \ a Cloud Management System operated over a Digital Twin scenario, using real-time\n\
    large-scale data produced from the connected IoT system. Through these scenarios,\
    \ we can observe\nthat our proposal remains the best choice regardless of the\
    \ time difference or energy load.\nKeywords: Internet of Things; smart; healthcare;\

    \ careful observation of behavior and activities”.\nMost of the time, people employ\
    \ monitoring to manage, direct, inﬂuence, or defend\nthemselves. Because they\
    \ carry out the monitoring, sensors, cameras, and other appropriate\ndevices are\
    \ essential to the monitoring process. With the aid of technology, it is possible\n\
    to observe someone from a distance using electronic devices or to steal electronically\n\
    transmitted information using straightforward, useful technology techniques [1–4].\n\
    The implementation of monitoring over wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is another\n\
    application of video monitoring. This has been widely incorporated into numerous\
    \ cyber-\nphysical systems, including trafﬁc analysis, public safety, environment,\
    \ and healthcare\nmonitoring. The unwired node connection facility in WSNs is\
    \ what causes the majority of\ncommon data transfer issues. Therefore, it is still\
    \ challenging for monitoring applications\nto process and transmit large amounts\
    \ of video data at each wireless node [2,3,5–8].\nAppl. Sci. 2023, 13, 9165. https://doi.org/10.3390/app13169165\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/applsci\nAppl. Sci. 2023, 13, 9165\n2 of 28\nNetworks\
    \ for communications may be utilized by monitoring technology. Considering\nthat\
    \ they transmit videos or data generated by monitoring equipment, a device must\
    \ be\nconnected to the network for the information to be transferred. Using a\
    \ method known as\nmulti-alteration, the geographic location of a mobile device\
    \ can be more easily determined,\neven when the phone is in standby mode. In other\
    \ words, tracing an inactive device can be\nperformed by comparing the lengths\
    \ of time required for a signal to go from one mobile\nphone to any nearby cell\
    \ tower [1–3,5,9].\nA recent development in communications technology is called\
    \ the Internet of Things\n(IoT). The IoT is “the system of physical objects and\
    \ devices with sensors and network\nconnectivity that enables these objects to\
    \ collect and share data” [1–3,5,6,10].\nThe next big development is IoT technology,\
    \ which will fundamentally alter how\nbusinesses operate. In the approaching years,\
    \ it is anticipated that there will be a sizable\nand quickly expanding number\
    \ of connected devices, installed sites, and operations that\nwould carry out\
    \ [3,5]. Also, the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is a new era of this\ntechnology\
    \ representing Healthcare–IoT systems and data [6,10–12].\nAdditionally, in places\
    \ such as ofﬁces, and homes, an array of sensors may monitor\nutility networks,\
    \ and provide early prior notice of falling electricity, water leakage, and\n\
    overload of the electricity network. The information gathered will be used to\
    \ improve\nperformance, pinpoint particular needs, and establish particular requirements.\n\
    The optimization of monitoring technology through the use of the Internet of Things’\n\
    technology requires the combination of these two technologies to fully beneﬁt\
    \ from them.\nAdditionally, another technique, known as Mobile Cloud Computing\
    \ (MCC), emerged\nand was enhanced by recent advances in the “cloud computing”\
    \ (CC) industry. By elim-\ninating the requirement for physical equipment, the\
    \ latter attempts to provide access to\ndata and information at any time and from\
    \ any location [6,10,11,13]. MCC is deﬁned as the\nintegration of cloud and mobile\
    \ computing, which makes mobile devices more capable.\nAdditionally, it represents\
    \ a modern strategy for businesses and organizations seeking\ncreative services.\
    \ Both the Internet of Things and video monitoring systems can beneﬁt\nfrom using\
    \ CC as a base, which will improve how they work [14–16].\nAt last, to verify\
    \ the operation of our proposal and to evaluate our proposed algorithm,\nwe used\
    \ a Digital Twin scenario. Our simulation method is based on novel software such\
    \ as\nCloudSim 3.0.3 and Cooja Contiki. The purpose of the Digital Twin scenario\
    \ is to simulate\nthe operation of a Smart Hospital, hosting a Cloud Server, through\
    \ which IoT Healthcare\ndata is transferred, managed, and processed. Digital Twin\
    \ offers more reliable results for\nour proposal. By creating a virtual model\
    \ that faithfully replicates a physical product, we\nemploy the Digital Twin concept\
    \ in our proposal to better forecast how well it will perform.\nAfter that, we\
    \ were able to extract useful information about the reliability of our proposal,\n\
    as well as the degree of improvement of the existing situation [17]. Thus, regarding\
    \ a Smart\nHealthcare system [18], the concept of a Digital Twin scenario would\
    \ be suitable due to\nsensitive medical data needing to be used.\nMoreover, the\
    \ major goal of this work is initially to survey emerging technologies and\nsystems\
    \ of the telecommunications ﬁeld, such as IoT, Monitoring, Big Data, and Cloud\n\
    Computing, and then to ﬁnd the open gaps in their integration model. This offered\
    \ us\nthe opportunity to discover novel ways to combine the aforementioned technologies\
    \ in\nthe era of achieving a better system. In addition to this, we have tried\
    \ to achieve a better\nway of transmitting and processing video/image data through\
    \ a Cloud-based Monitoring\nsystem by proposing a novel algorithm. Furthermore,\
    \ to produce an algorithm for better\ntransmission and management of IoT Big Data\
    \ over a Cloud environment through a Digital\nTwin scenario, simulating virtual\
    \ Cloud-Servers and a Smart Hospital installation in which\ndata produced from\
    \ a monitoring system is transferred, managed, and processed, we have\ntried to\
    \ produce an algorithm combining all the different models of encryption algorithms.\n\
    Finally, we can present the key contributions of our work as a result of the presentation\n\
    of the fundamental theoretical data of the research topic of this work. This work’s\
    \ key\ncontributions are:\nAppl. Sci. 2023, 13, 9165\n3 of 28\n•\nCombine the\

    \ In Section 2 there is a review of related\nresearch dealing with the technology\
    \ of IoT and the ﬁelds of Monitoring. Section 3 presents\nand analyzes the Monitoring\
    \ technique, and its different uses and functionality. Then, the\ntechnology of\

    \ The conclusions of the current\npaper are presented in Section 6, which also\
    \ suggests some fresh directions for the growth\nof future research.\n2. Background\
    \ & Current Research\nFor this paper, we studied and analyzed the existing literature\
    \ on the ﬁelds of moni-\ntoring and the IoT. We realized that the usage of monitoring\
    \ in general and its combination,\nspeciﬁcally with the IoT, became more vital\
    \ over the years. Thus, the rising number of\nstudies suggests that more study\
    \ is needed in this ﬁeld. Figure 1 illustrates the explosive\ngrowth of papers\
    \ addressing monitoring and concerns regarding the IoT. As we can see,\ncompared\
    \ to the prior decade, scholars’ interest has signiﬁcantly expanded over the past\n\
    seven years. As we can observe in the ﬁrst step of the diagram, the interest of\
    \ the papers\nengaged in this ﬁeld was very low, and on the other hand, after\
    \ ten years of research and\nthe advancement of technology, we realized that both\
    \ investigations and interest increased\nsigniﬁcantly. However, the rapid development\
    \ of the IoT, as it is perceived by its use in\nindustry, has contributed to this.\n\
    The following paragraphs present the papers that we ﬁltered out and contributed\n\
    signiﬁcantly to our study.\nTo begin with, we initially present the major research\
    \ that were conducted during\nthe period 2000–2010. R. T. Collins et al. [19]\
    \ presented research challenges for both\ntechnologies and applications of the\
    \ IoT. In addition to this, this work presents a summary\nof the major problems\
    \ affecting the development of technology and services of the IoT. C.\nClavel\
    \ et al. [20] presented how multimedia surveillance applications could detect\
    \ audio\nevents in noisy environments. This work concentrates especially on the\
    \ robustness of the\ndetection against the variable, malign conditions, and the\
    \ decrease of the false rejection rate.\nAll these are minutely signiﬁcant in\
    \ surveillance applications. Also, a consumer camera\nthat conceives a whippy\
    \ framework for semantic analysis of the behavior of humans from\na monocular\
    \ Video Surveillance (VS) is studied and proposed by W. Lao et al. [21]. The\n\
    proposed framework, which consists of four processing levels, was evaluated, and\
    \ showed\nits good quality and efﬁcacy as it achieved a close real-time prosecution.\
    \ In addition, R.\nH. Weber [22] addressed measures supporting the usage of methods\
    \ regarding the IoT, as\nwell as laws governing IT security. Also, in this work,\
    \ there is a discussion of the need to\nestablish a task force focusing on the\
    \ legal issues of IoT.\nAppl. Sci. 2023, 13, 9165\n4 of 28\nAppl. Sci. 2023, 13,\

    \ \nThe proposed framework, which consists of four processing levels, was evaluated,\

    \ In addi-\ntion, R. H. Weber [22] addressed measures supporting the usage of\

    \ this work, there is a discussion of the \nneed to establish a task force focusing\
    \ on the legal issues of IoT. \nThe next period we present is between 2011 and\
    \ 2019. One major work in this ﬁeld \npresents an application called Monitorix,\
    \ which is a video-based traﬃc surveillance multi-\nagent system described by\
    \ B. Abreu et al. [23]. The Monitorix agents are summarized in \nfour stages,\
    \ depending on the type of data processing they implement: sensors and per-\n\

    \ a model that takes an all-encompassing approach to the\nInternet of Things.\
    \ In addition, an elaborate framework for storing privacy data in VS as\na watermark\
    \ was proposed by W. Zhang et al. [26]. The simulation results of this work\n\
    showed that the proposed algorithm can incorporate all protected data on a video\
    \ without\ncompromising the visual quality. Consequently, the proposed video surveillance\
    \ system\nis capable of monitoring unauthorized persons in a conﬁned environment,\
    \ defending the\nsecrecy of the authorized persons but, simultaneously, permitting\
    \ sheltered information\nto be revealed safely and reliably. Additionally, A.\
    \ J. Lipton et al. [27] outlined a step-by-\nstep procedure for introducing moving\
    \ targets via real-time video streaming, classifying\nthem into speciﬁed groups\
    \ based on image-based characteristics, and then successfully\ntracking them.\
    \ The resulting system deﬁnes the objects of interest, rejects the state of the\n\
    background, and constantly observes the long distances and periods, despite obstructions.\n\
    It also notes any changes in appearance and dismissal of the moving target. Moreover,\
    \ a\nmethod for Internet-of-Things-aware Process Modelling, which utilizes UML\
    \ use cases and\nan existing BPMN-based notation that is IoT-aware, was presented\
    \ by R. Petrasch and R.\nHentschke [28]. Moreover, alternative approaches to consolidating\
    \ WSNs into the Internet,\nand a summary of possible challenges that should be\
    \ addressed soon, were evaluated by Md.\nS. Mahmud et al. [29]. This work unveiled\
    \ that the denouements currently developed on the\nInternet are not appropriate\
    \ for the resources of the narrow sensor node, and therefore, new\nAppl. Sci.\
    \ 2023, 13, 9165\n5 of 28\nmechanisms should be produced to conform to the potentialities\
    \ and restrictions of WSNs.\nIntegrated research on connectivity and energy-saving\
    \ aspects and solutions of the IoT in\nthe use of various wireless radio access\
    \ technologies was presented by A. Javed et al. [30].\nIt also discusses the possible\
    \ issues of the future use of IoT. Furthermore, a human vital sign\nmonitoring\
    \ system that comprises the measurement of body temperature and pulse rate\nof\
    \ patients from remote locations was presented by P. Hu et al. [31]. This system\
    \ occupies\ncertain features, such as minor intrusiveness to the users, and helps\
    \ both caretakers and\nphysicians by providing them with leisure in taking care\
    \ of patients.\nIn more recent work in the ﬁeld, between 2018 and 2020, initially,\
    \ for advanced scalable\nMedia-based smart Big Data on Intelligent Cloud Computing\
    \ systems, K. Psannis et al. [32]\nsuggested an effective algorithm (3D, Ultra\
    \ HD). Performance evaluations show that their\nsuggested approach outperforms\
    \ the traditional HEVC standard. According to the authors,\nthis suggested solution\
    \ might be utilized and integrated into HEVC as Smart Big Data\nwithout breaking\
    \ the standard. Moreover, P. Chandrakar et al. [33] developed a cloud-based\n\
    authentication protocol for e-health care monitoring systems, which provides a\
    \ secure plat-\nform for patients. With this proposed system, the patients–users\
    \ can obtain the best medical\nfacilities and treatment from doctors through their\
    \ mobile phones without physically vis-\niting the hospitals. Additionally, the\
    \ authors study the security aspects of their proposal\nby using a popular automated\
    \ pro-verify tool. Furthermore, M. S. Hossain et al. [34] put\nforth a B5G architecture\
    \ that makes use of the low-latency, high-bandwidth capabilities of\nthe 5G network\
    \ to identify COVID-19 using chest X-ray or CT scan images and created\na mass\
    \ surveillance system to track social distance, mask use, and body temperature.\
    \ In\naddition, to study the security aspect of their proposal, they used blockchain\
    \ technology to\nensure the security of healthcare data. In another work, for\
    \ applications involving health\nmonitoring, I. S. Binti Md Isa et al. [35] proposed\
    \ a brand-new fog computing architecture\nbuilt on a gigabit passive optical network\
    \ (GPON) access network. For their proposal,\nthey developed an Energy-Efﬁcient\
    \ Fog Computing (EEFC) model by using Mixed Integer\nLinear Programming (MILP)\
    \ to optimize the number and location of fog devices at the\nnetwork edge to process\
    \ and analyze health data for energy-efﬁcient fog computing. N.\nMani et al.’s\
    \ [36] research focused on healthcare using the IoT in real-time notiﬁcation\n\
    with the use of fog computing, which handles all the computing and aids clinicians\
    \ in\nfully comprehending the patient’s disease. The tools assist those who have\
    \ trouble under-\nstanding their condition and what they should do. A new computer\
    \ paradigm, called fog\ncomputing, has developed since it ﬁrst came into usage.\
    \ It aims to close the gap between\ncomputations and data sources from medical\
    \ facilities. Furthermore, the novel computing\nplatform established on the fog\
    \ computing paradigm can aid in reducing latency while\nsending and communicating\
    \ signals with faraway servers, which might speed up medical\nservices in the\
    \ spatial and temporal dimensions.\nFinally, the last and more recent works we\
    \ have studied are between 2021 and 2023.\nUsing the Digital Twin paradigm, H.\
    \ Elayan et al. [37] suggested and put into practice\nan intelligent, context-aware\
    \ healthcare system. This framework is a useful addition to\ndigital healthcare\
    \ and will enhance operational efﬁciency in the healthcare industry. In\norder\
    \ to diagnose heart disease and identify cardiac issues, a classiﬁer model for\
    \ ECG heart\nrhythms was created using machine learning. The built models accurately\
    \ and reliably\npredicted a speciﬁc heart condition using several strategies.\
    \ The application of machine\nlearning and artiﬁcial intelligence with various\
    \ human body parameters for continuous\nmonitoring and abnormality detection was\
    \ also inspired by the implementation of an\nECG classiﬁer that recognizes cardiac\
    \ problems. Furthermore, Digital twin research and\napplication are the main topics\
    \ covered by D. Yang et al. [38]. Additionally, they examined\ncurrent digital\
    \ twin breakthroughs before summarizing the theory behind the technology\nand\
    \ concluding with concrete advancements in several digital twin application ﬁelds.\n\
    Moreover, R. Rajavel et al. [39] introduced the Cloud-based Object Tracking and\
    \ Behavior\nIdentiﬁcation System (COTBIS), which can incorporate the edge computing\
    \ capability\nframework at the gateway level. This research is an emerging research\
    \ area of the IoT\nAppl. Sci. 2023, 13, 9165\n6 of 28\nthat can bring robustness\
    \ and intelligence to distributed video surveillance systems by\nminimizing network\
    \ bandwidth and response time between wireless cameras and cloud\nservers. Also,\
    \ the proposal of an IoT-based smart healthcare video surveillance system\nuses\
    \ edge computing to reduce the network bandwidth and response time and maximize\n\
    the fall behavior prediction accuracy signiﬁcantly compared to existing cloud-based\
    \ video\nsurveillance systems. On this basis, X. Li et al.’s [40] research aims\
    \ to do Big Data Analysis\non the huge amounts of data generated by the Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT) in smart cities,\ncausing the smart city to shift in the direction\
    \ of good governance and effective and secure\ndata processing. This study introduces\
    \ the Deep Learning method utilizing Big Data\nAnalysis and advances the distributed\
    \ parallelism technique of Convolutional Neural\nNetwork with a focus on the multi-source\
    \ data gathered in the smart city. X. Li et al.’s\nresearch led them to the conclusion\
    \ that enhancing the IoT-Big Data Analysis system of\nsmart cities can reduce\
    \ data transmission delay, improve data forecasting accuracy, and\noffer actual\
    \ efﬁcacy, providing experimental references for the future digital development\n\
    of smart cities. Furthermore, through their research, S. P. Ramu et al. [41] have\
    \ focused on\nthe integration of these two promising technologies for use in real-time\
    \ and life-critical\nscenarios, as well as for simplicity in governance in applications\
    \ based on smart cities.\nThe authors also present a thorough overview of the\
    \ numerous Federated Learning model\napplications in Digital Twin s based on smart\
    \ cities. This study’s key ﬁnding is that there\nare some signiﬁcant obstacles\
    \ to overcome and promising approaches moving forward for\nbetter Federated Learning-Digital\
    \ Twin integration in applications. At last, Z. Lv et al. [42]\nanticipate exploring\
    \ the Digital Twins of a Smart City’s Building Information Modeling\n(BIM) Big\
    \ Data (BD) processing approach in order to hasten the development of a Smart\n\
    City and enhance the precision of data processing. Building Information Modeling,\
    \ which\noptimizes diverse resources and building conﬁgurations, creates the keel\
    \ and structure of\nthe building. To process the multi-dimensional and complicated\
    \ Big Data based on the\ncompositive rough set concept, they also proposed the\
    \ Multi-Graphics Processing Unit\n(GPU): a complex data fusion and effective learning\
    \ technique. A brand-new architecture\nfor healthcare monitoring based on fog\
    \ computing was put forth by F. Alanazi et al. [43]\nto manage real-time notiﬁcation.\
    \ This proposed system uses machine learning algorithms\nto monitor a patient’s\
    \ body temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure values obtained\nfrom sensors\
    \ built into a wearable device. It alerts doctors or caregivers in real time if\
    \ any\ndeviations from the normal threshold value occur. Patients can also be\
    \ set up to receive\nnotiﬁcations to remind them to take their regular medications\
    \ or follow a healthy diet. The\ncloud layer keeps the large amounts of data there\
    \ for use by researchers and hospitals in\nthe future. Additionally, through their\
    \ research, N. El Imane Zeghib et al. [44] suggest a\nmulti-route plan that attempts\
    \ to ﬁnd a different path in order to guarantee the availability\nof time-sensitive\
    \ medical treatments. Different scenarios were created in order to assess\nthe\
    \ effectiveness of their suggested technique. Furthermore, when compared to the\
    \ most\nrecent relevant work, the experimental ﬁndings of this study show that\
    \ their approach is\nsuperior in terms of latency, energy consumption, and network\
    \ usage. With their chapter,\nM. Thakkar et al. [45] seek to obtain a better understanding\
    \ and perspective of the most\ncutting-edge IoT-based applications, such as Cloud\
    \ Computing and Fog Computing, and\ntheir implementations in the healthcare industry.\
    \ A few research articles from after 2015\nwere included in this chapter based\
    \ on the inclusion and exclusion criteria established for\nthe study. The conclusions\
    \ from these articles indicate that IoT-based fog computing and\ncloud computing\
    \ expand patient access to high-quality healthcare services. Additionally,\nthe\
    \ authors draw the conclusion from their work that edge computing could be used\
    \ to\ndramatically increase the availability of health services at home.\nTable\
    \ 1 demonstrates, in ascending, chronological order, the most important and\n\
    representative ﬁndings of the background research that represent the mapping problems\n\
    against solutions. Counting on the ﬁndings delivered from Table 1, we can conclude\n\
    that this ﬁeld gathers too much attention from researchers who tried to overcome\
    \ many\nissues that arise. Moreover, the research ﬁndings and the solutions to\
    \ problems that arose\nAppl. Sci. 2023, 13, 9165\n7 of 28\nshaped how we were\
    \ able to achieve our goal, in the design and implementation of the\nproposed\

    \ & Internet of Things\n3.1. Video Monitoring\nThe term Monitoring includes various\
    \ types of observation devices. These are: (1) Com-\nputer, (2) Telephones, (3)\
    \ Cameras, (4) Social network analysis, (5) Biometric, (6) Aerial,\n(7) Data mining,\
    \ (8) Corporate, (9) Human operatives, (10) Satellite imagery, (11) Identiﬁca-\n\
    tion and credentials, (12) RFID devices, (13) Human Microchips, (14) Devices,\
    \ (15) Portal\nservices, (16) Stakeout. In this paper, we single out and deal\
    \ with speciﬁc types of Video\nMonitoring, which are listed below [1–3,5,6,46–49].\n\
    3.1.1. Computer\nComputer supervision is the observation of computer activity\
    \ and the data stored\non the hard disk of this computer. If someone can establish\
    \ software on a computer\nsystem, they could easily acquire unauthorized admission\
    \ to that computer system, and\nconsequently, its data. This software could be\
    \ installed remotely or directly [50].\nAppl. Sci. 2023, 13, 9165\n11 of 28\n\
    3.1.2. Telephones\nPhone surveillance is deﬁned as “the act of executing phone\
    \ surveillance, location\ntracking, and phone data monitoring” [51].\n3.1.3. Cameras\n\
    Cameras are frequently associated with a recording device or an IP network, which\n\
    could be monitored by a security guard [52].\n3.1.4. Biometric\nThe Biometrics\
    \ type of monitoring refers to measurements related to human features.\nAlso,\
    \ it is used to identify individuals in groups that are under monitoring [53,54].\n\
    3.1.5. Data Mining\nData mining could be deﬁned as “an interdisciplinary subﬁeld\
    \ of computer science” [55].\nData mining is the implementation of statistical\
    \ techniques and programming algorithms\nthat dig out the previous unobserved\
    \ afﬁnities between data [15,54]. Data proﬁling may be\na very strong tool for\
    \ psychological and social network analysis [56].\n3.1.6. RFID Devices\nElectro-magnetic\
    \ ﬁelds are used by radio-frequency identiﬁcation (RFID) to automati-\ncally identify\
    \ and track tags afﬁxed to items. These tags include data that are electronically\n\
    stored. The passive tags acquire energy from an RFID reader placed close to the\
    \ radio\nsignals being questioned. The active tags have a local energy source\
    \ (e.g., a battery) [57].\n3.2. Internet of Things\nThe Internet of Things (IoT)\
    \ is a network of various gadgets that share and transmit\ninformation from the\
    \ real world to offer services to people, businesses, and society [12,58].\nAdvantages\
    \ of the Data\nOne major question relevant to the IoT is how it could inﬂuence\
    \ our daily life. Continu-\nous feeds are sent and received by every sort of sensor\
    \ to track and automate operations [59].\nIntending to bring about bold change\
    \ or enhance current services, there are various possi-\nbilities where the streaming\
    \ data could open up new markets. Several examples of ﬁelds\nthat constitute the\
    \ heart of this progress are listed below [60]: IoT-(a) Smart solutions in\nthe\
    \ bucket of transport, IoT-(b) Smart power grids incorporating more renewable,\

    3.3. Video Monitoring in Healthcare Sector\nIn a variety of contexts, including\
    \ patient monitoring, eldercare, clinical settings,\nand telemedicine, video monitoring\
    \ in healthcare was investigated and researched. Tech-\nnologies for video surveillance\
    \ have the potential to enhance patient care, increase safety,\nand simplify medical\
    \ procedures. The following are some important conclusions and\nrevelations from\
    \ academic studies on video monitoring in healthcare: (1) Remote Patient\nMonitoring\
    \ and Telemedicine: Without the need for in-person visits, video monitoring enables\n\
    healthcare professionals to remotely monitor patients’ symptoms, have virtual\
    \ consulta-\ntions, and provide medical recommendations. According to research,\
    \ telemedicine and\nvideo monitoring can enhance the management of chronic illnesses,\
    \ decrease hospital\nreadmission rates, and increase patient satisfaction. (2)\
    \ Fall Detection and Elderly Care: In par-\nticular, in eldercare settings, video\
    \ surveillance systems can be utilized to identify falls and\noffer quick assistance.\
    \ According to studies, adopting video-based fall detection technology\ncan speed\
    \ up reaction times, lessen injuries, and improve senior patients’ overall safety\
    \ and\nwellbeing. (3) Clinical Environment Monitoring: In healthcare settings,\
    \ video surveillance\ncan be used to increase staff training, patient safety,\
    \ and workﬂow effectiveness. Video\nAppl. Sci. 2023, 13, 9165\n12 of 28\nanalytics,\
    \ for instance, can be used to monitor patient compliance with hand cleanliness,\n\
    identify anomalous patient behaviors, and improve patient ﬂow in hospitals. (4)\
    \ Privacy and\nEthical Considerations: Maintaining patient privacy and upholding\
    \ ethical standards provide\na substantial problem in video monitoring healthcare\
    \ situations. Research has shown how\ncrucial it is to put in place strong security\
    \ measures, obtain patients’ informed consent,\nand make sure that all pertinent\
    \ data protection laws are followed. (5) Behavioral Analysis\nand Machine Learning:\
    \ Machine learning algorithms can be applied to video surveillance\nsystems to\
    \ assess patient behavior, spot patterns, and spot anomalies. For the purpose\
    \ of\nmonitoring individuals with cognitive impairments or mental health issues,\
    \ this technology\ncan be especially helpful. (6) Real-Time Monitoring for Critical\
    \ Care: When combined with\nother medical devices, video monitoring can provide\
    \ real-time insights into a patient’s\nstate, providing medical personnel with\
    \ useful information for prompt decision-making\nin life-or-death circumstances.\
    \ (7) Fall Risk Assessment and Prevention: Video monitoring\ncombined with machine\
    \ learning algorithms can aid in fall risk assessment and prevention.\nBy analyzing\
    \ gait patterns and identifying risk factors, healthcare providers can develop\n\
    personalized fall prevention strategies for patients. (8) Surgical Training and\
    \ Simulation: The\nuse of video monitoring as a training and simulation tool for\
    \ surgery was investigated.\nSurgery can be recorded and examined to assist aspiring\
    \ surgeons to hone their abilities\nand absorb knowledge from more seasoned mentors.\
    \ (9) Diagnostics and Telepathology:\nTelepathology can use video surveillance\
    \ to assess tissue samples from a distance and help\nwith diagnoses. This strategy\
    \ can enhance access to professional perspectives in areas with\nconstrained healthcare\
    \ resources.\nIt is signiﬁcant to emphasize that the use of video surveillance\
    \ in healthcare also brings\nup issues related to patient privacy, data security,\
    \ and the potential for improper usage of\nvideo. When implementing video monitoring\
    \ solutions in healthcare settings, it is crucial\nto put in place the necessary\
    \ precautions and make sure that they adhere to ethical norms\nand healthcare\
    \ legislation.\n3.4. Internet of Things Big Data in Healthcare Sector\nIoT-based\
    \ Big Data have received a great deal of attention in the healthcare industry\n\
    and hold great promise for enhancing patient care, illness management, and operational\n\
    efﬁciency. The following are some signiﬁcant themes and conclusions from various\
    \ scientiﬁc\nstudies on IoT-based Big Data in healthcare: (1) Remote Patient Monitoring\
    \ and Wearable\nDevices: Smartwatches and ﬁtness trackers are two examples of\
    \ wearables with capabilities\nof the IoT that are being employed for remote patient\
    \ monitoring. Vital signs, activity levels,\nand other health-related data can\
    \ be continuously collected by these devices and sent to\nhealthcare professionals\
    \ in real-time. According to research, remote patient monitoring with\nIoT Big\
    \ Data can help with early disease identiﬁcation, better chronic disease management,\n\
    and patient engagement. (2) Real-Time Healthcare Analytics: Real-time monitoring\
    \ and\ndecision-making are made possible by IoT-generated data in the healthcare\
    \ sector and\nBig Data analytics. For instance, IoT sensors built into hospital\
    \ equipment can deliver\nreal-time information on environmental conditions, patient\
    \ vital signs, and equipment\nstatus. Real-time data analysis can result in shorter\
    \ response times, device predictive\nmaintenance, and better patient outcomes.\
    \ (3) Healthcare Asset and Inventory Management:\nIn order to improve asset and\
    \ inventory management in healthcare institutions, IoT and\nBig Data are used.\
    \ Using IoT sensors to track medical supplies, drug inventories, and other\nnecessities\
    \ can improve operational efﬁciency overall, optimize resource use, and reduce\n\
    waste. (4) Healthcare Supply Chain Optimization: The healthcare supply chain is\
    \ also being\noptimized using IoT and Big Data technology. Healthcare providers\
    \ can more effectively\nmanage inventories, cut costs, and guarantee timely delivery\
    \ of essential commodities by\ncollecting and analyzing data on the movement of\
    \ medical supplies and drugs. (5) IoT-\nEnabled Smart Hospitals: Big Data analytics\
    \ combined with IoT technologies can build smart\nhospitals with interconnected\
    \ systems. The seamless data interchange between medical\nequipment, electronic\
    \ medical records, and patient information systems is made possible\nAppl. Sci.\
    \ 2023, 13, 9165\n13 of 28\nby this interconnectedness. Improved patient care,\
    \ increased patient safety, and resource\nallocation are all goals of smart hospitals.\
    \ (6) Health Behavior Monitoring and Predictive\nModeling: IoT devices have the\
    \ ability to gather information about patients’ everyday\nroutines, habits, and\
    \ lifestyle decisions. This information can be utilized to build predictive\n\
    models for health outcomes and interventions when paired with Big Data analytics.\
    \ For\ninstance, information from smartwatches can be used to track changes in\
    \ physical activity\nlevels or forecast sleep disorders. (7) Healthcare Data Privacy\
    \ and Security: It is crucial to\nprotect data privacy and security when IoT devices\
    \ collect and send critical patient data.\nIn order to safeguard patient information\
    \ from unwanted access or cyberattacks, recent\nresearch has concentrated on creating\
    \ secure IoT architectures, encryption methods, and\naccess control systems. (8)\
    \ Chronic Disease Management: By offering real-time insights\non patients’ health\
    \ problems, IoT Big Data has the potential to completely transform\nthe management\
    \ of chronic diseases. Chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension\ncan beneﬁt\
    \ from ongoing monitoring, since it allows for more individualized treatment\n\
    approaches and improved disease management. (9) IoT-Based Telemedicine and Virtual\
    \ Care:\nThe development of telemedicine and virtual care services is greatly\
    \ aided by IoT devices\nand Big Data analytics. Patients can obtain medical guidance\
    \ and treatment from the\ncomfort of their homes thanks to remote consultations\
    \ and virtual health platforms.\nThe use of IoT-based Big Data in healthcare is\
    \ a topic that is constantly changing,\nand new study ﬁndings are frequently released.\
    \ I suggest running searches on respected\nacademic databases and journals linked\
    \ to healthcare informatics and IoT technology to\nobtain the most recent research\
    \ articles and developments in this ﬁeld.\n4. IoT Contribution to Monitoring Systems\n\
    According to our research in the Background and Current Research Section, we\n\
    developed the following conclusions.\nThe event identiﬁcation problem in noisy\
    \ surroundings for a multimedia monitoring\napplication is the core challenge\
    \ of the Internet of Things and monitoring technology. This\nissue is resolved\
    \ with the detection of the anomaly in sequential audio recordings of public\n\
    spaces [20,40]. The Internet of Things (IoT) is also crucial for solving issues\
    \ with eHealth\nsystems, since connected patient data will enable more effective\
    \ and thorough treatment.\nAn all-encompassing Internet of Things model in an\
    \ eHealth scenario, which focuses on\ncreating an intelligent medical environment\
    \ and offering ubiquitous services at its best,\nresolves this problem [25]. Finally,\
    \ a condensed domain video watermarking solution based\non perceptual models resolves\
    \ the signiﬁcant payload issue in monitoring systems [26].\nTable 2 lists the\
    \ characteristics of the technology of the Internet of Things, concerning\nthe\
    \ commodity it provides. Additionally, it illustrates some of the varieties of\
    \ monitoring\nthat, from our perspective, are more closely related to the Internet\
    \ of Things. The purpose\nof Table 2 is to illustrate how certain properties of\
    \ the IoT relate to and beneﬁt particular\ntypes of monitoring. As we can see,\
    \ the forms of monitoring that are most affected by\ncharacteristics of the IoT\
    \ are cameras and RFID devices. Contrarily, the Biometric form of\nmonitoring\
    \ is the one that is least impacted by features of the IoT.\nTable 2. Internet\

    \ technologies. The challenges were examined concerning several related\npublications\
    \ that surveyed and suggested architectures that integrate monitoring and the\n\
    IoT: (1) event detection problems in noisy environments for a multimedia monitoring\n\
    application and (2) transmission of data through the video recorder devices, and\
    \ how those\ndevices should be set up for better remote usage.\nMore speciﬁcally,\

    According to Dlamini et al. [24] “The linking of precisely identiﬁable embedded\n\
    computing devices within the current Internet infrastructure” is how the Internet\
    \ of Things\nis formally described. IoT is typically expected to deliver universal\
    \ connectivity of the\nAppl. Sci. 2023, 13, 9165\n16 of 28\nsystems, services,\
    \ and devices that enable machine-to-machine (M2M) communications\nacross a variety\
    \ of protocols, applications, and domains.\nThere are a variety of ﬁelds and technical\
    \ challenges of Multimedia in the sector\nof IoT. Some of these are: (1) Experiment\
    \ measurement of multimedia communication\nin the IoT, (2) Distributed/Centralized\
    \ multimedia coding in the IoT, (3) Scalable and\nlow delay source coding in the\
    \ IoT, (4) Distributed multimedia compression in the IoT,\n(5) Communication and\

    \ to the Internet\nof Things, regarding the commodity they offer. Additionally,\
    \ they discuss a few of the\nTechnical Challenges of Multimedia in the IoT, which\
    \ in our opinion, are more relevant to\nthe Internet of Things. To begin with,\
    \ Table 4′s purpose is to illustrate which of the IoT’s\ndistinctive traits correspond\
    \ to the appropriate category, as well as to disperse the many\ntechnical obstacles\
    \ associated with multimedia communication in the IoT. Subsequently, the\nscope\
    \ of Table 5 is to show which of the characteristics of the IoT belong to and\
    \ distribute\nthe particular ﬁelds of the Technical challenges of Multimedia Applications\

    \ technology with the potential to make data and information available\nat all\
    \ times and from any location emerged based on the concept of CC. This type of\n\
    service acts without the limitation of hardware equipment [39,65,66]. The fault\
    \ tolerance\nand low-performance issues that typically prevent the use of huge\
    \ amounts of data could\nbe addressed by modifying the CC resources and methodologies\
    \ [66]. Also, one of the\nchallenges in the ﬁeld of IoT is the combination with\
    \ CC.\nThe necessity to maintain expensive computing gear and software is removed\
    \ by CC\ntechnology [67]. To address the recurring fault tolerance issues and\

    \ of data, the CC techniques and\nresources could be modiﬁed [68]. Also, one of\
    \ the challenges in the ﬁeld of the IoT is the\ncombination with CC. Given this,\
    \ CC offers a good way for things to become connected\nand allow users to access\
    \ various things on the internet [69–71].\nIn particular, a deﬁnition of MCC could\
    \ be the consummation of CC with mobile de-\nvices and services to render the\
    \ mobile devices well off in various terms such as storage and\ncomputational\
    \ power. MCC is the result of multidisciplinary approaches, blending mobile\n\
    computing and CC. CC also offers services, storage, computing, and applications\
    \ over the\nInternet. So, this multidisciplinary domain is moreover referred to\
    \ as MCC [39,65,66].\nThe following are some of the primary MCC characteristics\

    \ over the Cloud\nThe safety and security of the data generated by IoT-based systems,\
    \ which mostly\nrefers to Big Data, which is transferred and managed over a Cloud-based\
    \ system, is a key\nconcern for this research. Multiple aspects of data security\
    \ and privacy are involved in\nIoT-based Big Data secure transmission and administration\
    \ through a cloud system. Below\nis an overview of the main methods and safeguards\
    \ employed to guarantee the privacy\nand security of data in this situation.\n\
    Encryption: A crucial method for preserving data secrecy during transmission and\n\
    storage is encryption. For secure communication channels with cloud services,\
    \ IoT devices\ncan use encryption protocols like Transport Layer Security (TLS)\
    \ or Secure Sockets Layer\n(SSL). As a result, information sent between IoT devices\
    \ and the cloud is encrypted and\nkept out of the hands of unauthorized parties\
    \ [3,5,10,11].\nAccess Control: Access control technologies are essential for\
    \ limiting illegal access to\ncloud-based IoT data. To implement data access limitations\
    \ based on user roles, privileges,\nor particular attributes, role-based access\
    \ control (RBAC) and attribute-based access control\n(ABAC) are frequently utilized.\
    \ Mechanisms for access control help prevent unwanted data\nalteration or leaking\
    \ [3,5,10,11].\nData Integrity: For IoT data to be accurate and reliable, maintaining\
    \ data integrity is\nessential. Data integrity can be checked during transmission\
    \ and storage using methods\nsuch as message authentication codes (MACs) and digital\
    \ signatures. These methods aid in\nthe detection of unapproved data alterations\
    \ [3,5,10,11].\nSecure Protocols and Standards: It is crucial to adhere to secure\
    \ communication methods\nand standards. IoT device-speciﬁc protocols with security\
    \ features, like authentication\nand encryption, include MQTT (Message Queuing\
    \ Telemetry Transport) and CoAP (Con-\nstrained Application Protocol). Data transmission\
    \ over the cloud is secure when certain\nprocedures are followed [3,5,10,11].\n\
    Appl. Sci. 2023, 13, 9165\n19 of 28\nPrivacy Preservation: When working with sensitive\
    \ IoT data, maintaining user pri-\nvacy is essential. A useful analysis of the\
    \ aggregated data can still be performed while\nmasking or obscuring personally\
    \ identifying information (PII), using methods such as data\nanonymization, aggregation,\
    \ and differential privacy. While allowing useful insights from\nIoT big data,\
    \ privacy-enhancing solutions help protect user privacy [3,5,10,11].\nData Lifecycle\
    \ Management: The security and privacy of IoT data are supported by a\nthorough\
    \ approach to data lifecycle management. This includes regular backups to guard\n\
    against data loss and secure data deletion when it is no longer required. Data\
    \ lifecycle\nmanagement requires the implementation of data retention regulations\
    \ and secure data\ndisposal procedures [3,5,10,11].\nIntrusion Detection and Prevention:\
    \ Network trafﬁc can be monitored by intrusion\ndetection and prevention systems\
    \ (IDPS), which can then identify any unusual or mali-\ncious activity. To identify\
    \ potential security breaches or assaults on IoT devices or cloud\ninfrastructure,\
    \ advanced anomaly detection algorithms and machine learning approaches\ncan be\
    \ deployed. Real-time response to security incidents is made possible by these\n\
    tools [3,5,10,11].\nRegular Security Updates and Patches: The most recent security\
    \ patches and upgrades\nshould be applied to IoT devices, cloud systems, and related\
    \ software to maintain a\nsecure environment. This lessens the chance of exploitation\
    \ and addresses any known\nvulnerabilities [3,5,10,11].\nBased on the aforementioned\
    \ factors, effort was conducted in the ﬁrst stage to build\nan algorithm that\
    \ would harmonize the logic and operation of the most popular encryption\nalgorithms.\
    \ The technique that shows how to combine encryption algorithms for secure\ndata\
    \ management and transmission is described below.\nThe encryption and decryption\
    \ operations of the ﬁrst encryption algorithm are de-\nnoted in Algorithm 1 by\
    \ the functions encryptWithAlgorithm1() and decryptWithAlgorithm1(),\nrespectively.\
    \ The encryption and decryption functions of the second encryption algorithm\n\
    are represented, respectively, by the functions encryptWithAlgorithm2() and decryptWithAl-\n\
    gorithm2(). The actual encryption and decryption methods we want to employ each\
    \ time,\nsuch as AES, RSA, or any other encryption algorithms of our choice, can\
    \ be substituted\nfor the aforementioned function names in the suggested scenario.\
    \ The input of Algorithm\n1 obtains the transmitted data of video/image before\
    \ encryption and the output is the\ntransmitted data of video/image after encryption\
    \ and ready to be transmitted. Also, in the\nreverse procedure, Algorithm 1 obtains\
    \ the encrypted transmitted data of video/image\nand the output is the decrypted\
    \ transmitted data of video/image ready to be used.\nAlgorithm 1: Encryption/Decryption\
    \ procedure of transmitted data of video/image\n1. Initialize variables:\n- plaintext:\
    \ the original data to be transmitted\n- key1: encryption key for the ﬁrst encryption\
    \ algorithm\n- key2: encryption key for the second encryption algorithm\n- ciphertext:\
    \ the encrypted data\n2. Encrypt the data using the ﬁrst encryption algorithm:\n\
    encryptedData1 = encryptWithAlgorithm1(plaintext, key1)\n3. Encrypt the output\
    \ of the ﬁrst encryption using the second encryption algorithm:\nencryptedData2\
    \ = encryptWithAlgorithm2(encryptedData1, key2)\n4. Transmit the encrypted data\
    \ (encryptedData2) over the network.\n5. On the receiving end, receive the encrypted\
    \ data.\n6. Decrypt the encrypted data using the second encryption algorithm:\n\
    decryptedData1 = decryptWithAlgorithm2(encryptedData2, key2)\n7. Decrypt the output\
    \ of the second encryption using the ﬁrst encryption algorithm:\ndecryptedData2\
    \ = decryptWithAlgorithm1(decryptedData1, key1)\n8. The original plaintext data\
    \ is now recovered and stored in decryptedData2.\n9. Perform further processing\
    \ or utilize the decrypted data as needed.\nAppl. Sci. 2023, 13, 9165\n20 of 28\n\
    4.5. Video/Image Transmission and Processing Algorithm\nAdditionally, to the discussion\
    \ about the contributions of MCC, IoT, and Monitoring,\nin this subsection, we\
    \ will try to correlate the available connections that provide the\npossibilities\
    \ for accessing video/images that are transmitted and processed through a\nCloud-based\
    \ Monitoring system. Based on the related review and all the contributions\nthat\
    \ progressed previously, we sum up to the conclusion that the better way to contact\n\
    video/images that are transmitted and processed through a Cloud-based Monitoring\n\
    system will be through a new algorithm approach.\nRelying on the previous works\
    \ of Psannis et al. [32] and Balasubramanian et al. [72],\nand the whole related\
    \ works we studied, we can approach the video/image transmission\nand processing\
    \ with the following equation:\nbnext\nk+1 = b f irst\nk\n∗ [x ∗ ( f (Tk + . .\
    \ . + Tk−1)\n+g(PLk, PLk−1) + h(Sk + . . . + Sk−1))] + b f irst−1\nk−1\n(1)\n\
    In the above Equation (1) x represents a stable that highlights the signiﬁcance\
    \ of each\ncomponent, f, g, and h are three functions that compare the modiﬁcations\
    \ in each factor’s\nvalue to the ﬁrst time window. Additionally, PL represents\
    \ the value of the packet loss rate, T\nrepresents the value of the Round Trip\
    \ Time, S represents the value of the signal-to-interference\nand noise ratio,\
    \ and k represents the value of the sequence number of the current time window.\n\
    In the end, b f irst\nk\nrepresents the value of the bandwidth of the ﬁrst time\
    \ window, b f irst−1\nk−1\nrepresents the value of the bandwidth of the ﬁrst time\
    \ window-1, and bnext\nk+1 represents the value\nof the bandwidth of the next\
    \ time window, which is the time we need.\nCounting on Equation (1) that we ended\
    \ up with in our proposal, we can determine\nan algorithm that implements Equation\
    \ (1). Another term that we combine with our\nEquation (1) to achieve the proposed\
    \ algorithm is TW, which represents the value of the\nTime Window. Moreover, we\
    \ will also use LoK and LoA, which represent the value of the\nLayer of Keystone\
    \ and the value of the Layer of Absorption, respectively. The proposed\nalgorithm\
    \ is presented in (Algorithm 2).\nSpeciﬁcally, Algorithm 2 represents the whole\
    \ procedure implemented by our pro-\nposed Equation (1), consisting of our study\
    \ on previous works [6,10,11,66,73]. As a result,\nin Algorithm 2, we compare\
    \ the data from the First Time Window to the functions that\ndepict the change\
    \ in the value of each component of Equation (1). The suggested algorithm\n“calls”\
    \ the value of the Packet Loss Rate, Round Trip Time, Signal to Interface, and\
    \ Noise Ratio\nof each loop in a limited number of loops while the time is “paused”,\
    \ all from the client\nthat transmits and/or analyzes the video/image. Continuously,\
    \ counting on Equation\n(1), the algorithm calculates a better way to transmit\
    \ and/or process the video/image by\nchoosing a calculation scenario relying on\
    \ the type of the transmitted and/or processed\nvideo/image. Inside a loop function,\
    \ which is repeated until the value of bLoA is greater or\nequal than the value\
    \ of bnext\nk+1, the calculation takes as many times as the random variable x\n\
    is greater or equal to the value k, which is the sequence number of the particular\
    \ transmis-\nsion/procession. When the loop function ends, the particular video/image\
    \ starts to be\ntransmitted/processed to the client. Due to the requirement for\
    \ a rapid response to the\nclient’s request, the proposed algorithm’s process\
    \ is predicted to take less than one minute.\nThe input of Algorithm 2 is based\
    \ on three values that are necessary for the operation\nof the algorithm; ﬁrst,\
    \ the value of the packet loss rate (PL) count on the sequence number\n(k) of\
    \ each round; second, the value of the round trip time count on the sequence number\n\
    (k) of each round; and third, the value of the signal-to-interference and noise\
    \ ratio count on\nthe sequence number (k) of each round. Additionally, as an input,\
    \ Algorithm 2 obtains any\nadditional information added from each user of the\
    \ system. On the other hand, the output\nof Algorithm 2 extracts the transmission\
    \ data of the video/image transmitted each time\nthrough the system.\nThe proposed\
    \ algorithm is evaluated through a Digital Twin scenario, simulating\nvirtual\
    \ Cloud-Servers and a Smart Hospital installation in which data produced from\
    \ a\nAppl. Sci. 2023, 13, 9165\n21 of 28\nmonitoring system is transferred, managed,\
    \ and processed [73–76]. For the Digital Twin\nscenario, we used CloudSim and\
    \ Cooja Contiki to simulate our proposed system and\nalgorithm.\nWe tested several\
    \ scenarios on CloudSim to see how computationally complex the\nsuggested approach\
    \ is. The amount of time and data used in each situation varies. As we\ncould\
    \ see from the experimental ﬁndings in the next Section, our concept was evaluated\
    \ for\na various period of time and for a variety of energy consumption situations\
    \ that employed\nand generated data.\nAlgorithm 2: Digital Twin scenario of video/images\

    5. Experimental Results & Analysis\nThis section presents the experimental analysis\
    \ and the discussion of the experimental\nresults of our Digital Twin scenario.\
    \ To verify the better use of our proposal and to test\nits performance, we made\
    \ a variety of measurements so that we could assess our level of\neffort. With\
    \ the following experiments, we can show the importance of the Digital Twin\n\
    scenario for such systems that use large-scale data streamed through the network.\n\
    Figure 5 illustrates the data produced and transmitted through the procedure using\n\
    the proposed algorithm and a conventional algorithm. The blue line represents\
    \ the results\nof the conventional algorithm and the green line represents the\
    \ results of the proposed\nalgorithm. As we can observe, our proposal could be\
    \ more efﬁcient because it could\nproduce and transmit more data sets at the same\
    \ time compared with the conventional\nalgorithm. The impact of our proposed model\
    \ depicts the efﬁciency of the usage of a Cloud\nManagement System operated over\
    \ a Digital Twin scenario, using real-time large-scale data\nproduced from the\
    \ connected IoT system.\nThe Digital Twins concept is most frequently used to\
    \ better “predict” functionality\nthrough a virtual model designed to accurately\
    \ reﬂect a physical object. Through such a\nsystem, useful information could be\
    \ extracted about its reliability and its usage, as well as\nthe degree of improvement\
    \ of the existing system/object [73,76].\nAppl. Sci. 2023, 13, 9165\n22 of 28\n\

    Things with video monitoring technologies in future investigations. Additionally,\
    \ as a\nresult of this research, we would further examine the types of monitoring\
    \ that could beneﬁt\nfrom the Internet of Things contribution to technology. Since\
    \ MCC serves as the foundation\nfor both IoT and monitoring, we can assert that\
    \ the former enhances IoT functionality and\nhas an impact on different types\
    \ of monitoring technologies. Finally, as we can deduct from\nFigures 2 and 4\
    \ that a huge and vital issue for future study is the data security of video\n\
    monitoring through Cloud and IoT environments. Thus, there is a strong need of\
    \ further\nresearch in this area and, due to this, we are planning to overcome\
    \ all the difﬁculties to\nestablish a system like the one proposed for buildings,\
    \ such as small hospitals or small\nschools, in order to examine the operation\
    \ of our proposed scenario.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, C.L.S.;\

    1. Introduction Soil moisture (SM) has played vital roles in hydrological state
    and ecological processes which affects energy, water, and carbon cycles such as
    evaporation, transpiration, diversity and rainfall-runoff of various ecosystems
    (Ågren et al., 2021; efBabaeian et al., 2021; Robinson et al., 2008). Soil moisture
    is also a crucial predictor indicator for identify crop water stress, which helps
    agricultural drought monitoring. Thorough knowledge about the spatiotemporal patterns
    of SM is of essential importance for understanding water budgets in hydrological
    systems which helps prevent agricultural drought problems, water vulnerability,
    the issues of water shortage, and improve properly crop production across the
    world (Chaudhary et al., 2021; Tuller et al., 2019). Traditional ground techniques
    of soil moisture based on field experiments, in-situ soil sensing instrumentation,
    and geophysical and mobile sensing (Cheng et al., 2022; Robinson et al., 2008).
    The disadvantages of this method are high cost with small-scale monitoring. Remotely
    sensed measurements including active remote sensing and passive remote sensing
    recently have employed effectively for SM monitoring globally (Chaudhary et al.,
    2021; Cheng et al., 2022; Dubois et al., 2021; Prasad et al., 2018; Warner et
    al., 2021). At present, various satellite systems via microwave remote sensing
    like Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) (Entekhabi et al., 2010), Advanced Scatter
    meter (ASCAT) (Wagner et al., 2013), and Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS)
    (Kerr et al., 2001) have been explored for global SM monitoring with spatial resolutions
    of 10 km, 50 km, and 35 km, respectively. With the low spatial resolution, SM
    data obtained from these aforementioned missions have not been used widely in
    farm scales for agricultural management. Recent advances in earth observation
    technology such as using active and passive remote sensing (RS) imagery have been
    dedicated to solving the problems of SM dynamics retrieval on farming lands. Active
    remote sensing like Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) with highly flexible flight schedules
    and high spatial resolutions of images offer a great opportunity to estimate the
    SM for farm-scales (efBabaeian et al., 2021). The application of high-resolution
    about 2 m images from airborne LIDAR can accurately estimate the SM dynamics to
    support precision agriculture production (Ågren et al., 2021). However, the deployment
    of UAS and LIDAR have struggled with some obstacles such as limited fight time,
    high operation cost, and challenges with hyperspectral images processing which
    limits the application of active RS for SM monitoring (Gago et al., 2015). Multispectral
    remote sensing sensors such as Sentinel 1 and Sentinel 2 datasets from European
    earth observation program Copernicus have employed recently to capture effectively
    the SM content in several agricultural areas across the world with the spatial
    resolution of 10-100 m (El Hajj et al., 2017; Georganos et al., 2018). The free-of-charge
    imagery from Sentinel date at high spatial and temporal resolutions are a proper
    solution to address the challenges of hyperspectral images in agricultural SM
    prediction. The C-band of the Sentinel-1A and-1B Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR),
    and vegetation and soil indices from Sentinel -2A and -2B have been generated
    to estimate SM properties at high spatial resolution in the pilot scale (Aksoy
    et al., 2021; El Hajj et al., 2017; Karthikeyan and Mishra, 2021; Ma et al., 2021;
    Prasad et al., 2018; Schönauer et al., 2021; Senanayake et al., 2021). In addition,
    terrain indices from digital elevation (DEM) models such as slope, topographic
    wetness index (TWI), and death-to-water (DTW) index have also been used to predict
    the agricultural SM (Ågren et al., 2021; Murphy et al., 2008). Topo-hydrological
    indicators generated from high-resolution DEM data illustrated high correlations
    with soil properties and soil moistures by capturing the hydrological processes''
    characteristics of specific sites (Zhao et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2020a, Zhou
    et al., 2020b). According to Florinsky et al. (2002), soil properties including
    soil moisture have a significant relationship with topographic attributes, especially
    in agricultural landscapes. Machine learning techniques are already commonly applied
    to handle diverse and large volumes of remote-sensing datasets, with very high
    performances (Carranza et al., 2021; Gómez et al., 2020; Gómez et al., 2021; Hosoda
    et al., 2020; Karthikeyan and Mishra, 2021; Ma et al., 2021; Prasad et al., 2018;
    Schmidt et al., 2020). Artificial intelligence techniques such as random forest
    regression (RFR), support vector machine (SVM), extreme gradient boosting regression
    (XGBR), CatBoost gradient boosting regression (CBR) have been employed widely
    to estimate soil moisture products with high prediction accuracy (Ågren et al.,
    2021; Carranza et al., 2021; Senanayake et al., 2021). The RFR algorithm performed
    well to predict the field-scale of soil moisture in China using unmanned aerial
    vehicle (UAV) imagery with coefficient determination (R2) of 0.91 (Ge et al.,
    2019). The XGBR technique was used to estimate the SM dynamics in Swedish forest
    landscape using multiple LIDAR derived digital terrain indices with high performance
    values compared to RFR and SVM (Ågren et al., 2021). In general, ML algorithms
    provide a substantial potential for the SM estimation accurately. In this study,
    a new approach for soil moisture monitoring using the combination of three free-of-charge
    and high-resolution remote sensing datasets including Sentinel 1, Sentinel 2,
    and ALOS DSM was presented to estimate the soil moisture in field-scale. Four
    well-known ML algorithms including RFR, SVM, XGBR, and CBR were employed to test
    the performance of predictor variables from these datasets. The optimisation of
    hyper-parameters tuning and the selection of predictor variables during the construction
    phase of the ML techniques was applied to improve the performance of ML models.
    This study aims to: (1) assess the correlation of prediction indicators derived
    from multi-spectral images, SAR datasets, and ALOS DSM in the SM retrieval; (2)
    select and optimize features from these indicators using genetic algorithm (GA)
    and XGBR; (3) evaluate the prediction performance of the selected ML model (XGBR)
    with various scenarios of data-fusion level in the SM prediction while exploring
    the effectiveness of GA feature optimization on the ML model in mapping the SM
    content at 10 m spatial resolution; and (4) compare the estimation accuracy of
    XGBR model with other three well-known ML models using optimal features. The novel
    framework will be expanded to other field-scales or regional scales to build the
    SM map, which provides valuable data for different stakeholders like water managers,
    local authorities, and landholders to practice precision agriculture. 2. Materials
    and methods 2.1. Study area and soil sample collection The study sites are located
    in the Wests, Goomalling shire (latitude coordinate: −31° 18′ S and longitude
    coordinate: 116° 49′ E), and Cookies area - Northam shire (latitude: −31° 39′
    S, and longitude: 116° 39′ E) in the agricultural region of Western Australia
    (WA). The WA has a diverse type of agricultural production including vegetable
    industries which contributes a majority of total value of agricultural production
    in the region. Pastoral and cropping are two key agricultural practices in the
    WA (Kingwell et al., 2020). According to Australian Bureau of Agricultural and
    Resource Economics, high-rainfall, wheat-sheep, and pastoral zones are the main
    agricultural climatic zones in Australian (Salim and Islam, 2010). The type of
    climate in the WA is a Mediterranean climate where is hot and dry in summer, and
    cool and wet in winter seasons. The rainfall season is from April and October
    which ranges between 300 and 600 mm (Kingwell et al., 2020). Soil sampling points
    were selected from a binary land-use classification map which was produced by
    extreme gradient boosting classification from high spatial resolution Google Earth
    imagery and Sentinel 2 imagery. Nguyen et al. (2022) illustrated the detail of
    soil samples selection using the binary map. The active learning technique in
    remote sensing classification was used to assist in the selection of soil samples,
    which helps reduce the influence of vegetation on SM contents (Fu et al., 2010).
    Forty bare-soil sampling areas with a pixel (size of 10 m × 10 m) across the study
    locations (20 points for each plot) were identified from the binary map (Fig.
    1). A Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) was applied for accurately
    the samples'' location identification with an accuracy of 1–3 cm (Michalski and
    Czajewski, 2004). The soil samples were taken in April 2021. There are four soil
    cores being taken in each sampling area to a depth of 7 cm from each experimental
    block by a standard tube of 7.3 cm in diameter. The soil samples were sent to
    the laboratory for soil moisture analysis by oven drying method from Standards
    Association of Australia. Download : Download high-res image (484KB) Download

    the binary land-use classification map; (2) generating predictor indicators from
    optical (Sentinel 2), synthetic aperture radar (Sentinel 1), and terrain indices

    selection using genetic algorithm; (4) evaluating the performance of the XGBR
    model with five different scenarios developed from features derived from S1, S2,
    and ALOS DSM with 70% of SM measured dataset used for models'' training and 30%
    for models'' validation; and (5) comparing the performance of the XGBR model with
    other ML techniques using optimal features and building the SM dynamics map for
    the study areas. Download : Download high-res image (468KB) Download : Download

    2.3.1. Data acquisition In this research, soil moisture predictor variables were
    computed from S-2 multispectral satellite data, S-1 C-band dual polarimetric SAR
    imagery, and ALOS DSM (Table 1). While Sentinel 1 and Sentinel 2 images were downloaded
    from the Copernicus Open Access Hub from European Space Agency (ESA), the ALOS
    DSM 30 m imagery was acquired from JAXA Earth Observation Research Centre. The
    SNAP Sentinel Application Platform toolbox were used for both Sentinel datasets
    processing, whereas ArcGIS 10.4 was employed to process ALOS imagery and compute
    the ALOS-DSM derived features. All images were resampled to a ground sampling
    distance (GSD) of 10 m and geocoded in the same projection of World Geodetic System
    (WGS84) - Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) zone 50 South (50S). Table 1. Remote

    processing The S-2 image was processed via four main steps which presented in
    the Fig. 3. Ten multispectral bands were extracted for the study including B2,
    B3, B4, B5, B6, B7, B8, B8A, B11, and B12. Vegetation indices, soil indices, and
    water index were computed by thematic land processing function in the SNAP toolbox
    (Pasqualotto et al., 2019). Vegetation, soil and water indicators are presented
    as being sensitive to soil moisture content which recently was used for soil moisture
    properties estimation (Jin et al., 2017). Predictor variables derived from S-2
    were illustrated in Table 2 below. A total of 22 indicators were computed from
    S-2 for the SM prediction. Download : Download high-res image (111KB) Download

    module in the SNAP toolbox was used to process the S-1 imagery. There are seven
    main stages involving the extraction of the SAR dataset for the SM monitoring.
    The first one is to convert the S-1 raw data to scale backscatter coefficient
    (σ0) in decibel (dB) and correct the orbit file. The next steps are: (1) the removal
    of thermal and border noise; (2) radiometric calibration; (3) speckle filtering;
    (4) the correction of range Doppler terrain; (5) normalized radar backscattering
    coefficient; and (6) the computation of SAR prediction variables including two
    original bands from dual polarization (VH and VV); the five transformed bands
    (VV/VH; VH/VV; VV-VH; VH-VV; (VV + VH)/2); and the 20 new indicators generated
    from VV and VH using the GLMC algorithm. 2.3.3. ALOS image processing The Advanced
    Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) was launched by the Japan Aerospace Exploration
    Agency (JAXA) in 2006. JAXA recently provided the product of ALOS-DSM which is
    one of the newest remote sensing-based DEM. The ALOS-DSM has two kinds of resolution.
    ALOS-DSM with the resolution of 30 m is a free-of-charge dataset and higher prediction
    performance compared to Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) Global Digital Elevation
    Model (GDEM) ASTER GDEM and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission Digital Elevation
    Model (SRTM-DEM) (Nikolakopoulos, 2020). DEM and SLOPE derived indicators were
    generated by raster processing and calculation in ArcGIS 10.4. Fig. 4 shows the
    elevation of the study sites which ranges from 139 m to 480 m and slope is between
    0 and 87 degree. Download : Download high-res image (2MB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 4. Indices generated from ALOS DSM: (a) DEM and (b) SLOPE.
    Topographic Wetness Index (TWI) generated from digital elevation model (DEM) has
    been used for soil moisture estimation because TWI is helpful to identify the
    place where water is accumulated in the specific area with the differences of
    elevation. TWI highlights the terrain-driven balance of the catchment water supply
    and the water drainage of specific local areas. However, there are various algorithms
    such as a flow accumulation, a flow width, or a slope algorithm can be employed
    to compute TWI. It should be selecting the best one that the TWI obtains the high
    correlation with soil moisture content. The best TWI for soil moisture prediction
    is Freeman flow algorithm, local slope, and the equal cell size of flow width
    which was generated by the following equation (Kopecký et al., 2021) (Fig. 5).

    accuracy of ML techniques was tested with different scenarios which were developed
    based on the level of S-1, S-2, and ALOS DSM data fusion and the results from
    feature selection and optimization using GA. The five scenarios were presented
    in Table 3. While SC1 comprises of 22 indicators derived from S-2 and 3 indicators
    from ALOS-DSM, SC2 includes 27 S1 features, and three features derived from ALOS-DSM.
    SC3 consists of 22 S-2 predictor variables and 27 S1 variables. SC4 contains the
    total 52 features generated from both S-1, S-2, and ALOS DSM. The potential of
    21 optimal features from GA selection for SM prediction was evaluated in SC5.The
    scenarios were presented in Table 3 below. The aim of scenarios development was
    to evaluate the impact of the level of different features combinations and the
    application of feature selection algorithm on how well the SM dynamic prediction
    went. Table 3. Lists of developed scenarios for soil moisture estimation. Scenario

    learning algorithm 2.4.1. Extreme gradient boosting regression (XGBR) Extreme
    gradient boosting technique is one of gradient tree boosting algorithms which
    developed by Chen and Guestrin (2016). It has a high performance for supervised
    learning to handle both regression and classification problems (Ha et al., 2021).
    The extreme gradient boosting regression (XGBR) algorithm is presented as a scalable
    end-to-end tree boosting which has widely used to address data mining issues (Chen
    and Guestrin, 2016). The XGBR is applied commonly because of its high execution
    speed with parallelization, out-of-core computation, and cache optimization. Data
    scientists prefer using the ML model due to its scalability in various scenarios,
    and its high performance for limited data studies. The XGBR model has a large
    of number of hyperparameters such as learning rate, max_depth, n_estimators, and
    gamma, which affects its performance. In this study, Optimal XGBR hyperparameters
    was explored by a Grid Search method with five-fold CV by testing the integration
    of hyperparameters. 2.4.2. Random forest regression (RFR) The RFR algorithm is
    a well-known machine learning algorithm and easily applied effectively for various
    applications due to its simplicity to tune, train, and validate (Breiman, 2001).
    This ML model consists of a wide range of regression trees. Each regression tree
    is developed by bootstrapped training samples from the input dataset which can
    helps reduce the risk of overfitting issues of ML algorithms. In generally, the
    samples will be separated with about two-thirds of the dataset (in-bag data) for
    the training samples and the others for the validation samples (Out-Of-Bag (OBB
    data) (Pham et al., 2020). Three crucial parameters of RFR includes the number
    of regression trees generated from the bootstrap sample of the observation, the
    number of prediction features at each node, and the minimal size of the terminal
    nodes. The selection of these parameters can affect the performance of RFR. 2.4.3.
    Support vector machine (SVM) The SVM algorithm was developed by Cortes and Vapnik
    (1995). It is one of the most popular supervised learning techniques using the
    kernel approach and statistical theory, which can handle for classification, regression,
    and outlier''s detection problems (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995; Cristianini and Ricci,
    2008). While the SVM can be applied effectively to death with non-linear problems,
    this technique does not obtain high performances with a noisy and overlapped dataset.
    Regularization parameter, the kernel function, and gamma controlling the overfitting
    are three main hyper-parameters of the SVM model which influences the prediction
    accuracy of this technique. Four types of kernel function for the SVM are polynomial,
    sigmoid, linear and radial basis function. The grid search with a five-fold CV
    was employed to identify the optimal hyper-parameters of each ML algorithm in
    Jupyter Notebook environment. 2.4.4. CatBoost gradient boosting regression (CBR)
    CBR is known as a family member of gradient boosted decision trees (GBDT''s).
    It is an interdisciplinary approach for classification and regression tasks in
    time-series and big data (Hancock and Khoshgoftaar, 2020). It can also solve and
    minimize the issue of over-fitting by identifying the best tree structure for
    the calculation of the leaf values (Dorogush et al., 2018). CBR have recently
    been employed for soil parameters and soil carbon estimation (Xu et al.). Max
    depth, learning rate, and the number of iterations is the key hyper-parameters
    of the CBR model. It is similar to XGBR, important hyper-parameters were tuned
    by hyperparameter tuning using grid search with five-fold CV to select optimal
    ones which helps improve the CBR model performance. 2.5. Genetic algorithm (GA)
    for feature selection Features selection is vital for the ML model''s performance.
    It also helps simplify the models, reduce the time for training and testing model,
    and address overfitting issues. A genetic algorithm with the XGBR method was employed
    to determine automatically optimal indicators for the SM content retrieval in
    the study from the total of 52 variables derived from selected RS missions. GA
    implementation includes the following stages: (1) population formation from soil
    samples; (2) generation of a mating pool based on the highest fitness individual
    values; (3) the selection of parents from the mating pool by random selection
    methods; and (4) the generation of parents'' offspring using crossover and mutation
    operators. The selected generation with optimal features illustrates the lowest
    root mean squared error, RMSE. In this research, firstly, the prediction accuracy
    of the four ML algorithms including XGBR, CBR, RFR, and SVM were tested with all
    52 generated features. The best predictive model was used with GA to select the
    optimal features. The prediction performance of selected ML models using the optimal
    features were then tested and compared. The prediction accuracy of ML models for
    soil properties can be improved with the use of the GA for the selection of predictor
    variables (Xie et al., 2015). 2.6. Model performance evaluation To assess the
    model performance of the soil moisture estimation, two standard testing criteria
    were used to evaluate the performance of ML techniques with various scenarios
    including: the root mean square error (RMSE), and the coefficient of determination
    (R2). Superior model performance illustrates the higher R2 and lower RMSE. These
    criteria are assessed using the equations below: (2) (3) where: n indicates the
    number of soil samples; Pi and Oi illustrate the predicted SM value and measured
    SM value of the i sample, respectively. Akaike''s Information Criterion (AIC)
    and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) indicator were employed to compare
    the performance of difference ML models for soil moisture estimation. Lower AIC
    and BIC values illustrated the better prediction accuracy of regression models
    (Claeskens and Hjort, 2008). These indicators were evaluated using Eqs. (4), (5)
    below: (4) (5) where: SSE illustrates the sum of squares errors; n indicates the
    number ò soil samples, and K presents the parameter''s number. 3. Results and
    discussion 3.1. Correlation analysis of predictor indicators and measured SM The
    relationship between the input features derived from S-1, S-2, ALOS-DSM and measured
    SM content was computed by Pearson''s correlation coefficient method. According
    to Table 4, indicators derived from ALOS imagery have a higher correlation with
    the SM content compared to other indicators. While DEM and Slope obtained negative
    correlations, TWI illustrated a positive correlation with the SM. All vegetation
    indices generated from S-2 demonstrated negative correlation with the SM content.
    Some these indices revealed higher correlations with the SM content including
    NDVI, SAVI, and IRECI. Color index from soil indices had a higher correlation
    to the SM compared to another SIs. NDWI confirmed a negative and high relationship
    with the estimation of SM. Regarding to the S-1 derived indicators, most transformation
    bands obtained weak correlations with the SM content, however; VV, VH, and most
    GLCM textures from VV confirmed strong relationships with the measured SM. Table

    Evaluation and comparison of scenarios and different ML models The proposed XGBR
    model was trained and tested with different scenarios which were developed by
    various features extracted from S-1, S-2 and ALOS DSM (Table 5). The genetic algorithm
    procedure with extreme gradient boosting regression was implemented to select
    the best subset comprising of 21 optimal predictors out of 52 variables with the
    best accuracy of 0.75. The SC5 with optimal number of features including seven
    vegetation indices (NDWI, RVI, NDVI, GNDVI, SAVI, MCARI, IREC1), 11 S-1 derived
    indicators (VH, VV, MeanVHVV, VV_Contrast, VV_Dissimilarity, VV_Homogeneity, VV_Angular
    Second Moment, VV_Energy, VV_Maximum Probability, VV_Entropy, VV_GLMC Correlation),
    and both three variables from ALOS DSM yielded the highest SM estimation accuracy
    with the highest R2 of 0.891 in the validation phase and the lowest RMSE of 0.875%,
    followed by SC4 with the maximum number of features extracted from selected sensors.
    A combination of S-2 and ALOS DSM derived predictor features illustrated a higher
    performance than the combination of S1 and DEM and S-1 and S-2 generated indicators.

    the SM content with the proposed XGBR-GA model using multi-source EO data fusion.
    The comparison of ML techniques was conducted with optimal features derived from
    S-1, S-2, and ALOS DSM. According to Table 6, gradient boosting regression algorithms
    (XGBR) outperformed RFR and SVM. While XGBR-GA achieved a highest prediction accuracy
    with R2 = 0.891 and RMSE = 0.875, followed by CBR with R2 = 0.789 and RMSE = 1.217
    and SVM with R2 = 0.493 and RMSE = 1.850. The RFR produced a lowest prediction
    performance with R2 = 0.368 and RMSE = 2.491. Moreover, the XGBR-GA also presented
    lowest value of AIC and BIC compared to CBR, RFR and SVM. Table 6. Performance

    with optimal variables extracted from these multiple sensors using the genetic
    algorithm compared to CBR, RFR, and SVM. The proposed model using XGBR and GA
    indicates an R2 value of 0.891, showing a higher prediction result compared to
    recent SM monitoring studies with R2 reached 0.83 in SM prediction study using
    S1 and Landsat-7 data in Egypt (Mohamed et al., 2020) and R2 of 0.72 in surface
    soil moisture estimation using S1 and S2 in India (Tripathi and Tiwari, 2020).

    importance of SM prediction indicators The estimation accuracy of the SM content
    has been greatly affected by predictor indicators selection and machine learning
    algorithm. The higher level of data fusion with optimal feature selection using
    the GA illustrated better prediction performance for retrieving the SM content.
    The XGBR had a higher capability to predict the SM pattern. The study also indicated
    that the GA could help improve the prediction accuracy of the SM estimation which
    is similar with the results from recent studies using ML models and GA for soil
    properties estimation (Xie et al., 2015). The successful application of ML models
    and big data from RS imagery in the SM prediction has been presented in much research
    at the regional, national and global scale (Carranza et al., 2021; Chaudhary et
    al., 2021; Cheng et al., 2022; Fang et al., 2021; Ma et al., 2021; Senanayake
    et al., 2021). The relative importance of optimal features using the GA is presented
    in Fig. 8. ALOS DSM-derived terrain indices played important roles in the SM prediction.
    Terrain variables were also mentioned as important indices for the SM prediction
    in previous studies (Ågren et al., 2021; Leempoel et al., 2015; Zhao et al., 2021).
    In addition, dual polarization VV, VH, and GLCM textures derived from S-1 are
    also crucial indices for the SM prediction. The SAR-based prediction indices can
    improve the estimation of soil moisture (El Hajj et al., 2017; Ma et al., 2020;
    Zhao et al., 2021). VH was illustrated as the most sensitive index for the SM
    retrieval in this study. Vegetation indices were selected as optimal features
    for the SM prediction such as the normalizer difference vegetation index (NDVI),
    and soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) which have been applied for not only
    vegetation classification, but also further indirectly the SM estimation (Kogan,
    1995; Reza et al., 2020). Normalized difference water index (NDWI) from Sentinel
    2 also highly correlated with the SM content (Ma et al., 2020). The soil moisture
    prediction model using the XGBR-GA should be calibrated and tested with large-scale
    earth observation data, over several of land-use types, and various soil-depths.

    4. Conclusion The present work presented a novel framework using the predictor
    variables from Sentinel datasets at 10 m and ALOS DSM at 30 m spatial resolution
    with a state-of-art machine learning technique (XGBR) and GA for the SM prediction.
    It is used for estimating the SM content in study sites of Western Australia.
    It can be seen that the combination of the selected remote sensing dataset illustrated
    to be very effective for the SM prediction. High level of data fusion and the
    GA method for optimal features selection showed remarkably better prediction accuracy
    than single sensor derived features or scenarios without feature optimization.
    The XGBR model with 21 optimal prediction variables using genetic algorithm approach
    illustrated the highest prediction performance (R2 = 0.891, RMSE = 0.875%). In
    addition, the proposed XGBR model combined with GA algorithm for variables selected
    can produce SM maps at 10 m spatial resolution using freely remote sensing datasets
    with a precise accuracy at different scales from field plots to region areas.
    VH and DEM had the highest relative importance in predicting the SM dynamics.
    The proposed model should be tested in large-scale areas with various land-use
    characteristics in further studies. In conclusion, this SM pattern monitoring
    approach can assist agricultural drought monitoring, the development of appropriate
    water management strategies, and precision agriculture in terms of climate change.

    Publisher: IEEE Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction According to the World
    Food Programme (WFP) the number of people facing high levels of food insecurity
    in 2023 more than doubled the number in 2020. The war in Ukraine, supply chain
    disruptions, the continued economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic, heat waves,
    heavy rainfall, and droughts due to global warming are all factors pushing food
    prices to all-time highs. Without appropriate solutions, falling crop yields will
    push many people into poverty. As an example, approximately 43 million people
    in Africa alone may fall below the poverty line by 2030. Accurate and timely prediction
    of crop yields of large farmlands using innovative technologies such as UAV monitoring,
    multi-spectral sensors, satellite imagery analysis, and use of machine learning
    tools is a promising area of research to tackle world food insecurity. Recognizing
    the importance of this, the upcoming USA farm bill - a massive piece of legislation
    that funds agricultural programs budgeted at more than USD $ 1 trillion is expected
    to direct billions of dollars to such solutions that help farmers conserve resources,
    fight climate change or cope with disasters. Wheat is the most widely grown crop
    in the world, owing to its vital role in global food security and contribution
    to the national economy of a country. For 35% of the world’s population, wheat-based
    foods serve as their primary source of nutrition crop [1] and contribute more
    calories & protein to the global diet than any other grain crop. There are various
    factors that significantly affect the global food supply chain, such as climate
    change, population growth, urbanization, market trends, pandemics, regional conflicts,
    plant diseases, availability & management of agricultural resources, etc [2].
    In this perspective, timely yield prediction of wheat yield prior to harvesting
    can help farmers and other stakeholders to plan and implement necessary interventions
    for mitigating any adverse impact and ensuring food security. For this purpose,
    several techniques have been developed, including process-based simulation models
    and data analysis-based statistical algorithms employing multi-source data [3].
    Among these techniques, Machine Learning (ML) is a powerful statistical technique
    that delivers promising results due to its ability to autonomously learn complex
    relationships and solve complicated real-world problems. Random Forests (RF),
    Linear Regression, Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), K-Nearest
    Neighbor (KNN), Ridge Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Gradient Boosting
    algorithms, Light Gradient Boosting (LightGBoost), Convolutional Neural Network
    (CNN), and Deep Neural Network (DNN) are well-known ML techniques for yield prediction
    [4], [5]. For the prediction of crop yield using ML techniques, data acquisition
    is a critical preliminary phase that substantially impacts the quality and accuracy
    of the prediction. In this context, remote sensing platforms are commonly employed
    to acquire optical, multispectral, and hyperspectral data. Analysis of this data
    provides useful insights about crop phonology and forms the basis for estimating
    crop yield [6], [7]. Commonly used remote sensing platforms include satellites,
    specially equipped planes, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Each platform
    collects data with its own specific spatial & temporal resolution and acquisition
    rate [8]. Typically, the satellites provide low spatial resolution data with a
    fixed temporal resolution, which limits their use for certain agricultural applications.
    Recently, UAVs and drones have become promising substitutes for remote sensing
    satellites as these can collect high-resolution data with flexible timings, making
    these more appropriate for crop yield prediction [9] Following data collection,
    data pre-processing is the next critical process where the collected data is reviewed,
    formatted, and prepared for further analysis. It includes noise removal, dealing
    with the inconsistent & missing values, data augmentation & aggregation, feature
    selection & creation, and discretization etc [10]. The remote sensing data, containing
    hyperspectral and multispectral information, is used to compute different vegetation
    indices (VIs) which help to capture several parameters related to crop phenology
    and growth. These VIs are derived from the measurement of reflected solar radiations
    across the electromagnetic spectrum that represent specific vegetation characteristics.
    The most common VIs are the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced
    Vegetation Index (EVI), Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), Leaf Area Index
    (LAI), Infrared Percentage Vegetation Index (IPVI), Normalized Difference Red
    Edge Vegetation Index (NDRE), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), Atmospherically
    Resistant Vegetation Index (ARVI), Wide Dynamic Range Vegetation Index (WDRVI),
    Green Ratio Vegetation Index (GRVI), and Green Chlorophyll Vegetation Index (GCI)
    [8], [11], [12]. Subsequently, the computed VIs are utilized as input for the
    ML algorithm to perform a particular task of interest including yield prediction.
    Duan et al. [13] used UAV drone imagery to compute several VIs including NDRE,
    NDVI, GNDVI, EVI, etc, and then employed linear regression for the estimation
    of rice yield. The results show that NDVI and GNDVI are the most appropriate VIs
    for rice yield prediction with an estimation error of less than 10%. In another
    study [14], UAV multispectral data is used to compute WDRVI, NDVI, and GRVI for
    maize yield prediction. The results indicate that WDRVI is the most relevant VI
    to predict maize yield with the nitrogen application of 250–300 kg/ha. In addition
    to the ML techniques, the usage of deep learning (DL) techniques is also becoming
    increasingly popular in the agriculture sector where deep CNN and long short-term
    memory networks (LSTM) are commonly employed architectures. Nevaruori et al. [15]
    used a deep CNN model with six layers to predict the wheat yield using UAV multispectral
    and optical data. The model was able to accurately predict yield with a mean absolute
    error of 484.3 kg/ha and a mean absolute percentage error of 8.8%. Similarly,
    Wang et al. [16], used LSTM to predict the wheat yield using LAI where the MSE
    was found to be 522.3 kg/ha with a coefficient of determination ( R 2 ) as 0.87.
    Cao et al. [17] explored the usage of random forest, deep neural network, LSTM,
    and 1D CNN for wheat yield prediction and compared results obtained from the application
    of ML and DL techniques. The results reveal that all aforementioned models have
    the predictive capability to estimate the winter wheat yield with the R 2 ≥0.85
    and RMSE≤768 kg/ha. Recent studies highlight the increasing trend of utilizing
    data from multiple sources to enhance predictive performance. For this purpose,
    data from heterogeneous sources such as meteorological data, soil-related data,
    and remote sensing data are exploited. In [18], wheat yield is predicted using
    multi-source data including remote sensing data, climate data, and soil data.
    For this purpose, eight different ML techniques are applied to the collected data,
    where Gaussian process regression (GPR), SVM, and Random Forest (RF) achieved
    the highest performance with prediction error < 10%. Moreover, the predictive
    performance is evaluated in the four wheat growth stages to find the best time
    for predicting the crop yield. Similarly, in [19], a novel approach for crop yield
    prediction is presented that integrates data from several sensors (RGB, multi-spectral,
    and thermal infrared) installed on UAV platform which collects extensive data
    sets related to plant health, growth patterns, and environmental variables. Subsequently,
    different ML models are applied to combined data including Random Forests, NN,
    SVM, Cubist, and Ridge Regression for grain yield estimation. The key finding
    of the study is that multi-sensor data fusion-based yield prediction performed
    better than individual-sensor data. In [20], crop yield is predicted using MODIS
    data along with the twelve different climate variables using ML techniques including
    LASSO, SVM, NN, and FR regression. The results indicate that SVM outperformed
    with the R2 of 0.79. Another study [21] presents a framework to predict crop yield
    using data collected from different sources including environmental data, Sentinel-2
    data, and yield data. The results show that RF achieved the highest accuracy with
    the R2 of 0.91. It is observed from the literature that the utilization of data
    from diverse sources has become common. Moreover, the significant parameters related
    to crop yield are recorded during the entire growth cycle to perform yield prediction.
    However, a few studies have investigated the different growth stages to find the
    most appropriate stage for precise yield estimation. Furthermore, a notable gap
    exists in the literature pertaining to the influence of sowing dates on crop production
    and its implications for crop productivity enhancement. While various studies
    have examined predictive models based on comprehensive datasets, there is a limited
    focus on the temporal aspect of crop growth, specifically the effect of different
    sowing dates on subsequent yield production. This gap is particularly significant
    because the timing of crop sowing has a direct impact on crop development, phenology,
    and yield. In this context, the proposed study aims to bridge this gap by introducing
    a framework that incorporates heterogeneous data and predictive models, and also
    explicitly investigates the impact of different sowing dates on crop yield. For
    this purpose, multispectral images of the crop field are captured throughout the
    growth cycle and various VIs are computed to assess crop phenology. Additionally,
    field surveys are performed to record several agronomic parameters to analyze
    the behavior of crop growth. Subsequently, different prediction models are applied
    to the collected datasets and further evaluated for different growth stages to
    discover the time window that optimally captures the crop progression. The step-wise
    workflow of the proposed framework for wheat grain yield prediction is shown in
    Figure 1. FIGURE 1. Wheat grain yield prediction workflow. Show All The objectives
    of this research are listed below: Feature Selection for Prediction: To select
    the best set of predictors for enhancing the prediction performance Optimal Time

    prediction Best Regression Model Selection: To identify the most appropriate prediction
    model for wheat yield estimation. Optimal Sowing Timing: To explore the effects
    of different sowing dates on crop yield and find the best time for crop sowing.
    In light of these objectives, the research endeavors to provide valuable insights
    into the optimization of wheat yield prediction by leveraging different data sources,
    temporal considerations, and robust predictive modeling techniques. SECTION II.
    Materials and Methods A. Study Area and Experimental Design This research is based
    on data collected from the wheat experimental field of the National Agricultural
    Research Centre (NARC), located in Islamabad, Pakistan (33.6692481° N, 73.1076928°
    E). The experimental field consists of three main plots where wheat is grown with
    three different sowing dates (SD) including (i) SD1: Nov 15, 2021, (ii) SD2: Dec
    15, 2021, (iii) SD3: Jan 15, 2022. Each of these plots is further divided into
    three replications and each replicate contains plots of 15 different wheat varieties
    of area (1.5m X 6m). Wheat seeds of fifteen different varieties (V1, V2,...V15)
    are planted at the rate of 112.5 g/plot in every replicate. Hence, there are 45
    plots for each SD organized in three replicates and each replicate contains 15
    plots corresponding to 15 varieties of wheat seed to minimize statistical error
    for the study. The experimental setup utilized a randomized complete block design
    (RCBD) as illustrated in Figure 2. FIGURE 2. Experimental design (a) Study area,
    (b) Experimental field layout. Show All B. Data Preparation 1) Data Collection
    For the purpose of wheat yield estimation, data pertaining to multispectral bands
    and various agronomic traits are collected during the whole growth cycle of the
    crop. The multispectral data is captured by DJI Phantom 4 drone mounted with the
    Sentera multispectral imager that acquires red and near-infrared (NIR) bands.
    The drone is employed to collect aerial imagery of the field using a flight pattern
    that is fully automated and designed using customized Sentera ‘FlightAgent’ software.
    For data acquisition, multiple flights are carried out at the height of 80ft with
    more than 80% overlapping of ground coverage during days of clear skies and minimal
    wind speeds, between 10:00 am to 11:00 am local time. Drone data collection was
    initiated in February 2022, coinciding with the ‘single shot stage’ of the crop
    sown under SD3, and concluded during the ‘ripening stage’ of the crop sown under
    SD1. Subsequently, data was acquired via eight drone sessions on the following
    dates: (i) February 10, 2022, (ii) February 21, 2022, (iii) March 2, 2022, (iv)
    March 11, 2022, (v) March 17, 2022, (vi) March 31, 2022, (vii) April 8, 2022,
    (viii) April 15, 2022. After capturing multiple individual images covering the
    entire experimental field, the raw images are processed to generate a mosaic using
    WebODM which is an open-source software developed by OpenDroneMap [22]. This powerful
    tool is capable of generating point clouds, georeferenced models, elevation models,
    and 3D maps. It provides support for multiple processing engines, enhancing the
    efficiency of UAV and satellite image processing using Structure from Motion (SfM)
    and Multi-View Stereo (MVS) techniques. The software employs a web-based interface,
    simplifying the utilization of complex image processing algorithms. Its primary
    objective is to analyze extensive datasets and transform photographs into accurate
    georeferenced outputs. These outputs find applications in diverse fields like
    agriculture, urban planning, and environmental monitoring, among others. After
    generating the ortho mosaic images by WebODM, the resultant images are further
    segmented into 135 polygonal shapes in order to extract valuable insights for
    the crop sown in each plot. Additionally, several ground surveys were performed
    during the month of March 2022 and April 2022; where the wheat crop undergoes
    different development stages with respect to their sowing dates. Subsequently,
    the parameters related to wheat yield are recorded including the number of tillers/m2,
    bundle weight/m2, and grains weight/m2, where all collected data is used to predict
    the wheat yield. 2) Data Preprocessing It is an essential phase that involves
    transforming the raw data into an appropriate format prior to the application
    of advanced data analysis techniques. It mainly focuses on data cleaning, feature
    engineering, data scaling, dealing with categorical features, data integration,
    and feature selection [23], [24]. In order to enhance the quality of the data
    for regression analysis, we performed the following preprocessing steps considering
    our dataset: Data Cleaning: It is a mandatory phase prior to applying the regression
    technique and leads to the high performance of the ML model. For this purpose,
    the collected data is deeply analyzed to check for outliers, missing values, noise,
    and inconsistencies in the data points. Observed anomalies in the dataset are
    removed prior to the application of ML. Feature Engineering: It involves the manipulation
    of data to extract underlying significant patterns using domain knowledge that
    substantially impacts the performance of ML algorithms. For this study, nine features
    are generated from the collected data including six VIs, crop growth stage, no.
    of tillers/m2, and bundle weight/m2. Subsequently, these features are fed into
    regression models to predict the grain yield. Data Scaling: It refers to transforming
    the data to fit inside a certain range to improve the effectiveness of the ML
    model. Later, data scaling is applied to the computed features to fit them into
    a specific scale of [0-1]. One hot Encoding: It is a technique used to deal with
    the categorical features in the dataset as discussed in [25], [26]. In the collected
    feature set for wheat grain yield prediction, the growth stage is a categorical
    feature that has been transformed into a numerical feature using one-hot encoding.
    Feature selection: It is an important preprocessing phase that boosts the performance
    of the ML regression model and prevents overfitting. In this step, a subset of
    the most relevant features is selected from the large feature set to perform regression
    analysis. The feature set created for the wheat grain yield prediction contains
    nine features. The top ‘k’ most important features, out of the complete feature
    set, are selected by computing the correlation of each feature with the target
    variable [27]. C. Vegetation Indices (VIs) Vegetation Indices (VIs) are derived
    from the measured values of surface reflectance at two or more wavelengths to
    emphasize a specific characteristic of vegetation. The multispectral data collected
    by the drone is used to compute several VIs including NDVI, SR, IPVI, SAVI, OSAVI,
    and TSAVI by using relationships and hyperparameters as given in Table 1. TABLE
    1 Vegetation Indices Figure 3 shows various VIs, computed in the month of February,
    for the crop sown on different dates i.e., SD1, SD2, and SD3. It is evident from
    Figure 3 that all computed VIs have higher values in the wheat field with SD1
    where the crop is in the ‘stem elongation’ stage. On the other hand, the crop
    with SD2 is in the ‘tillering stage’ and all VIs have slightly smaller values
    as compared to the early planted wheat crop with SD1. However, all VIs have very
    small values in the wheat field with SD3 which is still in the ‘single shot’ stage.
    It is also evident from these plots that the wheat crop with SD1 is in the ‘50%
    heading’ stage, the wheat crop with SD2 is in the ‘booting’ stage, and the wheat
    crop with SD3 is in the ‘stem elongation’ stage. Subsequently, the variation in
    all computed VIs with respect to the crop growth can be visualized in Figure 4
    which lists observed parameters in the month of March. Likewise, Figure 5 depicts
    the values of VIs in the month of April where the wheat crop with SD1 is in the
    ‘50% ripening’ stage, the wheat crop with SD2 is in the ‘milk development’ stage,
    and wheat crop with SD3 is in the ‘100% heading’ stage. FIGURE 3. Statistical

    distribution of all computed VIs corresponding to different sowing dates SD1,
    SD2, and SD3 in the month of April 2022. Show All D. Regression Techniques After
    preprocessing the collected data, different regression techniques are employed
    to predict the grain yield of the wheat crop. These techniques are discussed in
    the following subsections: Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO):
    It is a popular regression technique that uses a statistical approach to determine
    the linear relationship between features and the target variable [34]. To prevent
    overfitting and optimize feature selection, a penalty term is incorporated into
    the cost function that incentivizes the model to choose a subset of the most significant
    features. The goal of LASSO regression is to find the set of predictor variables
    that strongly influence the output while penalizing the magnitude of the regression
    coefficients to avoid overfitting. This is accomplished by employing a penalty
    term that represents the total of the absolute values of the regression coefficients.
    In this way, regression coefficients having the least relevance to output are
    effectively set to zero, removing the corresponding predictors from the model
    [35]. LASSO is particularly useful for high dimensional data having a large number
    of predictor variables and some of these may not be relevant for predicting the
    outcome variable. In this research study, the LASSO regression is applied with
    the regulation parameter ‘alpha’ set to 0.1. Random Forest: It is a well-known
    decision tree-based ensemble technique used for ML classification and regression
    problems [36]. The basic idea is to develop several decision trees, where each
    decision tree is developed utilizing a subset of features and a random sample
    of data. In order to predict the target value, each decision tree generates an
    output and the final value is evaluated by aggregating all generated outputs [37].
    Random forest is considered a robust ML model that can deal with noisy data and
    multiple features without overfitting. To predict wheat grain yield, the random
    forest is applied with the number of the estimator set to 100 while the ‘squared_error’
    function is employed for assessing the quality of the split. Xtreme Gradient Boosting
    (XGB) Regression: It is another powerful ensemble learning-based ML model employed
    for both regression and classification [38], [39]. This technique combines different
    weak models (commonly decision trees) to generate a stronger model. It iteratively
    builds and combines decision trees to reduce the loss function during each iteration
    in such a way that the new model attempts to rectify the errors of previous decision
    trees. In order to find the best hyperparameters of XGB, ‘GridSearchCV’ is used
    where the model is tested against several values and combinations of hyperparameters.
    Subsequently, the XGB regression model with ‘n_estimator’ value of 100, and a
    ‘max_depth’ value of 3 is used to predict grain yield. In order to evaluate the
    performance of the regression models, the following commonly employed evaluation
    metrics have been used [40]: Coefficient of determination (R2): It is a dimensionless
    metric in the range from 0 to 1 that is used to assess the ability of the regression
    model to predict the outcome. It represents the percentage of the variance in
    the dependent variable (target variable) that can be predicted from the independent
    variables (feature variables). A higher value of the coefficient implies better
    prediction performance. It is computed by using Eq 1. R 2 =1− ∑ n i=1 ( y i −
    y i ^ ) 2 ∑ n i=1 ( y i − y ¯ ) 2 (1) View Source where n is the number of data
    points, y i ^ is the predicted value of the dependent variable for the i th data
    point, y i is the actual value of the outcome for the i th data point, and y ¯
    is the mean value of the dependent variable. Mean Absolute Error (MEA): This metric
    assesses the performance of the regression model by measuring the average absolute
    deviation between the predicted values and the actual value. It is evaluated using
    the Eq 2. MEA= 1 n ∑ i=1 n | y i − y i ^ | (2) View Source where y i is the actual
    value of the output variable for the i th data point, y i ^ is the predicted value
    of the output variable for the i th data point, and n is the number of observations
    in the dataset. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): It is a commonly used statistical
    parameter to evaluate the prediction performance of the regression model. It is
    based on the square root of the average squared difference between the predicted
    values and the actual values of the output variable. It is calculated by using
    Eq 3. RMSE= 1 N ∑ i=1 N ( y i ^ − y i ) 2 − − − − − − − − − − − − −  ⎷   (3)
    View Source where y i is the actual value of the output variable for the i th
    data point, y i ^ is the predicted value of the output variable for the i th data
    point, and n is the number of observations in the dataset. SECTION III. Results
    In order to predict the wheat grain yield, three regression techniques are selected
    including random forest, LASSO, and XGB. All three techniques are commonly employed
    in situations having multiple features while avoiding overfitting. The collected
    dataset comprised nine features including the number of tillers, bundle weight,
    SR, SAVI, OSAVI, IPVI, NDVI, TSAVI, and growth stages. The target feature for
    prediction was grain weight. To analyze the relationship between the selected
    feature variables with the target variable, the correlation matrices are created
    for the three different growth stages of the wheat crop as shown in Figure 6,
    7, and 8. However, the values of correlation matrices vary according to the growth
    stage of the crop. In the month of February, all computed VIs are highly correlated
    with the target variable; whereas the values of correlation coefficients start
    to decrease in March and April. These variations in the values of VIs are attributed
    to the chlorophyll content in the vegetation which keeps on increasing until the
    wheat crop reaches the grain-filling stage and then starts declining for the rest
    of the growth cycle. It is noteworthy that the dataset collected in February does
    not include the parameters ‘Bundle weight’ and ‘Number of tillers’, as these particular
    parameters were not recorded until March 2022. FIGURE 6. Correlation of input
    features with the target variable in February 2022. Show All FIGURE 7. Correlation
    of input features with the target variable in March 2022. Show All FIGURE 8. Correlation
    of input features with the target variable in April 2022. Show All It is evident
    from Figure 6, 7, 8 that the feature variables have correlations with each other
    leading to multicollinearity which makes it difficult to determine the individual
    effect of the features on the target variable. To address this problem, correlation
    statistics are used to compute ‘k’ most important and relevant features. For this
    purpose, the correlation of each feature variable with the target variable is
    computed and converted to an F-value representing the feature importance score.
    Figure 9 shows the F-value of all numerical features in different growth stages
    of the wheat crop. FIGURE 9. Feature selection using correlation statistics (a)
    February 2022 (b) March 2022 (c) April 2022. Show All The features with the highest
    F-value are selected for regression, whereas the rest of the features are eliminated
    from the model to avoid overfitting. In the month of February, the selected features
    were ‘NDVI’, ‘IPVI’, ‘SAVI’, ‘TSAVI’, and ‘OSAVI’; where the remaining features
    have been not considered. However, in the month of March, ‘bundle weight’ has
    the largest F-value followed by ‘SR’ and ‘TSAVI’. The remaining VI features have
    an equal F-value; where ‘NDVI’ is selected after assessing its effect on regression.
    Likewise, ‘Bundle weight’, ‘No of tillers’, ‘Growth stage heading complete’, and
    ‘NDVI’ are the selected features for the month of April. The feature selection
    phase addressed the first objective of the research i.e., to select the best set
    of predictors for enhancing the prediction performance. After feature selection,
    the regression models are applied in different growth stages of wheat crops and
    their performance is evaluated using three metrics: R2, MAE, and RMSE. For this
    purpose, the dataset comprising all sowing dates is divided into training and
    testing splits with a ratio of 7:3 respectively. Table 2 shows the performance
    comparison of the regression models on the data collected in February 2022; whereas
    Figure 10 illustrates the deviation between the predicted and actual wheat grain
    yield on a testing split containing 37 data points. It is apparent from Table
    2 that LASSO generates the best prediction results with R2 of 0.92, MAE of 27.95
    g/m2 and RMSE 33.32 g/m2. However, Random Forest performed better than XGB with
    R2 of 0.90, MAE of 28.49 g/m2. TABLE 2 Performance Comparison of Regression Techniques
    Applied to the Data Collected in February 2022 FIGURE 10. Deviation between the
    actual and the predicted grain yield in February 2022. Show All Similarly, Table
    3 presents the performance comparison of regression techniques applied to the
    dataset collected in March 2022. Best results are again generated by LASSO giving
    the highest R2 of 0.93 with the MAE of 22.91 g/m2 and RMSE of 31.06 g/m2. Figure
    11 shows the predicted grain yield versus actual grain yield against three regression
    techniques based on observations made in the month of March. TABLE 3 Performance
    Comparison of Regression Techniques Applied to the Data Collected in March 2022
    FIGURE 11. Deviation between the actual and the predicted grain yield in March
    2022. Show All Table 4 compares the results of three regression models on the
    basis of data collected in April 2022. The predicted grain yield for the various
    regression techniques versus actual yield is shown in Figure 12. These results
    clearly demonstrate that LASSO once again performed better than Random Forest
    and XGB for the dataset from the month of April. TABLE 4 Performance Comparison
    of Regression Techniques Applied to the Data Collected in April 2022 FIGURE 12.
    Deviation between the actual and the predicted grain yield in April 2022. Show
    All In order to evaluate the influence of individual features on regression performance,
    the widely used SHAP (Shapley Additive explanations) method is employed [41].
    The SHAP feature importance graphs provide a comprehensive insight into the model’s
    interpretability and sensitivity to individual features and their contributions
    to predictions. To quantify the performance of each feature on the prediction
    model, all possible combinations of features are considered, and computing the
    difference in predictions when a particular feature is included versus when it
    is excluded. This difference served as SHAP value which signifies the degree of
    influence a feature wields on a prediction in comparison to its absence. Figure
    13, 14, and 15 illustrate SHAP feature importance graphs that are computed on
    the datasets collected in February 2022, March 2022, and April 2022. FIGURE 13.
    Contribution of each feature using SHAP value on data collected in February 2022.
    Show All FIGURE 14. Contribution of each feature using SHAP value on data collected
    in March 2022. Show All FIGURE 15. Contribution of each feature using SHAP value
    on data collected in April 2022. Show All It is evident from the SHAP feature
    importance graphs that all selected features demonstrate roughly equal contributions
    in the case of Random forest on the dataset collected in February 2022. However,
    ‘NDVI’, and ‘SAVI’ have a significant contribution in the case of LASSO regression;
    whereas ‘NDVI’ has a dominant contribution in the case of XGB regression. Conversely,
    a distinct pattern emerges with the data collected in March 2022 and April 2022.
    where ‘Bundle weight’ has more contribution than any other feature. Similarly,
    the comprehensive visual representation of each feature’s contribution across
    all regression techniques can be observed in Figures 13, 14, and 15. In conclusion,
    the analysis of these graphs offers valuable insights into the influential dynamics
    of specific features in shaping the model’s outcome. Notably, changes in features
    with high positive SHAP values (indicated by red color code) can lead to proportionate
    shifts in predictions, while those with negative values(indicated by blue color
    code) might cause counteractive shifts. This profound understanding of feature
    importance not only enhances interpretability but also sheds light on the intricate
    relationships between input variables and outcomes. Furthermore, to conduct an
    in-depth analysis of the performance exhibited by various regression techniques,
    different graphs have been generated including a violin graph, Taylor diagram,
    and scatter plot as shown in Figure 16, 17, and 18. The violin graphs provide
    a statistical summary of actual versus predicted wheat grain yield by different
    regression techniques. Whereas, the scatter plots illustrate the difference in
    actual versus predicted wheat grain yield by plotting test data. However, Taylor
    diagrams provide deeper insights into the model performance in terms of standard
    deviation ratio, correlation, and centered root-mean-square error from the reference
    dataset [42]. These graphs offer a holistic view of how well each regression technique
    matches up against the true data, allowing for a deeper understanding of their
    relative performance. It is evident from these graphs that the regression results
    are pretty good on the dataset collected in April 2022 as compared to February
    2022 and March 2022. Furthermore, it is notable that the LASSO regression technique
    produces prediction results that more closely approximate the actual dataset.

    actual and predicted values of wheat grain yield on test dataset. Show All It
    can be observed from the regression results that minimum MAE and RMSE are achieved
    by LASSO in the month of April 2022. This addresses the second research objective
    of this study i.e., to identify the suitable time window for accurate wheat yield
    prediction. The results from Tables 2, 3 and 4 show that LASSO achieved the best
    performance due to its ability to deal with high dimensional data and avoid overfitting.
    This addressed the third objective of the research i.e., to identify the most
    appropriate prediction model for wheat yield estimation. A comparison of an average
    wheat grain yield versus predicted yield for wheat fields with different sowing
    dates SD1, SD2, and SD3 is given in Table 5. It can be clearly seen that the highest
    average grain yield is achieved from the wheat field where the crop was sown on
    15 November 2021 (SD1). This finding addressed the fourth objective of this research
    study i.e., to explore the effects of different sowing dates on the crop yield
    for identifying the best crop sowing time. TABLE 5 Comparison of Average Predicted
    and Actual Wheat Grain Yield in the Wheat Field With Different Sowing Dates (SD1,
    SD2, and SD3) In order to further analyze the growth behavior of the crop with
    different sowing dates, NDVI maps of the wheat field are developed as shown in
    Figure 19. The maximum greenness is observed in the month of March 2022 in the
    wheat field with SD1 which depicts the ideal growth behavior for the wheat crop.
    On the other hand, less vegetation is observed in the wheat field with SD2, and
    minimal vegetation is seen in the field having SD3. This is due to the fact that
    wheat, like any other crop, requires a specific temperature profile for its optimal
    growth. The wheat fields with SD2 and SD3 are sown in the months of December and
    January respectively. For wheat sown during these months, the temperature profiles
    do not match the optimal values required for crop growth, resulting in reduced
    grain yield. The correspondingly highest yield is obtained for SD1 and wheat production
    reduces as sowing is delayed beyond the optimal sowing date. FIGURE 19. NDVI profiles
    of wheat crop in SD1, SD2, and SD3. Show All It is worth mentioning that fifteen
    different wheat varieties were sown on three different dates in the experimental
    fields. It has been concluded that the highest average yield was obtained for
    SD1 and production dropped as sowing was delayed. However, the yield was found
    to vary for different varieties even for the same sowing date. Figures 20–22 show
    the wheat grain yield obtained by fifteen different wheat varieties on three different
    sowing dates (SD1, SD2, and SD3). FIGURE 20. Grain yield of different varieties
    in a wheat field with sowing date SD1. Show All FIGURE 21. Grain yield of different
    varieties in a wheat field with sowing date SD2. Show All FIGURE 22. Grain yield
    of different varieties in a wheat field with sowing date SD3. Show All A. Effect
    of Different Sowing Dates, Climate Variations and Genotypes on Crop Growth and
    Yield Varying sowing dates have a great impact on wheat yield. For this purpose,
    an investigation is carried out to check the response of wheat crop growth and
    yield of different advanced lines under three diverse sowing dates. The maximum
    average annual yield is recorded with the sowing date SD1 (292.25 g/m2), followed
    by sowing date SD2 (180.0 g/m2), and the minimum is recorded with the sowing date
    SD3 (58.25 g/m2) respectively (Table 5). Among different genotypes (varieties),
    the maximum yield is recorded with V8 (351 g/m2), followed by V3 (347 g/m2) in
    the wheat crop with sowing date SD1. Whereas, the minimum yield is recorded with
    V12 (225 g/m2) respectively as shown in Figure 20. In the wheat field with sowing
    date SD2, the highest yield is recorded with V13 (218 g/m2) followed by V6 (210
    g/m2), and the lowest response is recorded with V9 (153 g/m2) as depicted in Figure
    21. Similarly, the response of genotypes sown on sowing date SD3 is different
    in comparison to SD1 and SD2, where the highest yield is recorded with V14 (119
    g/m2), followed by V3 (85 g/m2), and the minimum yield is recorded with V10 (17
    g/m2) as illustrated in Figure 22. It is concluded that the maximum yield is obtained
    with SD1 as compared with the wheat crops sown in succeeding sowing dates. However,
    due to the genetic potential of different genotypes, a significant variation is
    observed in the wheat yield response under different sowing dates. SECTION IV.
    Discussion The crop yield prediction holds significant importance in optimizing
    agricultural resources and boosting overall productivity. To this end, a field
    experiment is presented to predict wheat grain yield; where different regression
    techniques have been investigated including LASSO, Random Forest, and XGB regression.
    For this purpose, the multispectral data is collected by drone in different crop
    growth stages along with different agronomic traits. Moreover, the effect of different
    genotypes and the sowing plan on wheat growth and its yield is analyzed by sowing
    the crop on three different sowing dates. Subsequently, three regression techniques
    are applied to three different datasets collected in February 2022, March 2022,
    and April 2022 to determine the best time window to accurately estimate the wheat
    crop yield. The results revealed that the best results for wheat grain prediction
    were observed in the month of April, where LASSO outperformed XGB and Random Forest
    with the minimum difference between the actual and predicted yield (31.69 g/m2,
    21.64 g/m2, and 10.96 g/m2 for SD1, SD2 and SD3 respectively). Figure 16, 17,
    and 18 illustrate the performance comparison among regression techniques using
    a violin graph, scatter plot, and Taylor diagram. It is clearly evident that LASSO
    provides a more accurate estimation of wheat grain yield as compared to XGB and
    Random Forest. The effectiveness of LASSO in controlling overfitting with limited
    data, its ability to provide sparse solutions, and its interpretability make it
    particularly well-suited for addressing this specific problem. In contrast, the
    Random Forest and XGBoost algorithms, while powerful and capable of handling complex
    relationships within data, might struggle with limited data. These ensemble methods
    inherently rely on aggregating multiple decision trees, and their performance
    typically improves with larger datasets. With a small amount of data, there’s
    a higher risk of overfitting due to the complexity of these models. Additionally,
    tuning the hyperparameters of these algorithms becomes crucial, and without sufficient
    data, finding optimal hyperparameters can be challenging, leading to suboptimal
    performance. It is observed from the results that the optimal time for sowing
    the wheat crop is November (SD1); where the maximum grain yield of 351 g/m2 has
    been recorded. Whereas, the minimum yield of 17 g/m2 has been observed for the
    crop that was sown lately in January (SD3) due to a reduction in the length of
    the growing season. The suitable time of sowing is imperative to achieve the maximum
    yield on a sustainable basis because wheat production is highly sensitive to elevated
    temperatures. Erratic climate has influenced the optimum time of wheat sowing
    and grain production by variations in temperature during the growth period of
    the crop. The process of plant development accelerates due to elevation in temperature;
    however growth parameters reduced such as leaf area, tillers, and length of the
    spikes which results in a significant reduction of yield [43], [44]. Late sowing
    seriously affects germination, growth rate, grain development, and reduced tillering
    in low temperatures and ultimately concealed yield [45]. Similarly, elevation
    in temperature during vegetative and reproductive growth stages badly affects
    the emergence of plants and succeeding crop growth stages [46]. For this purpose,
    an optimum and appropriate environment results in a higher economic yield which
    aids genotypes to express their full growth potential. Wheat, as a cereal, requires
    specific environmental conditions for improved growth and production [43] and
    is vulnerable if exposed to high temperatures through the reproductive phase at
    grain formation [47]. The favorable temperature that is essential for the anthesis
    & grain filling phase of wheat ranges from (12 °C - to 22 °C). High temperature
    accelerates the process of development of grain filling [48], thus resulting in
    a reduction of assimilation of carbohydrates, deposition of starch in grains,
    and yield of grains [49]. With the management of the sowing date, potential variety
    and environmental factors production of wheat can be increased by 10-80% [50].
    Whereas, late planting affects germination, growth, and development of grains
    and produces poor tillers due to winter injury in low-temperature [45], [51].
    Therefore, it is very necessary to find the relationship between varying environments
    and newly developed genotypes. An appropriate sowing time for wheat plays a significant
    role in growth and development. However, in varying climatic conditions of Pakistan,
    it is estimated that yield may be decreased by 58.2 % in delayed sowing practice
    [52]. The precise and exact information of sowing time of specific variety at
    a particular location is crucial for meeting the potential yield of grains as
    discussed in [53]. Optimum environmental conditions are prerequisites for attaining
    the maximum yield. It has been found from research that each variety has its specific
    requirements of temperature and light for flowering and development of grains
    [54], [55]. However, the emergence and number of days to earing for the crop with
    sowing date SD1 decreased with delayed planting to sowing date SD2. Cultivation
    of wheat under late sowing results in a reduction of air and soil temperature
    causing a decrease in the emergence and crop stand establishment [56]. It has
    been reported in various studies that elevated temperature affects the emergence
    of crops [57]. Late planted crops decreased no. of tillers due to high temperature
    during the growth stage of tillering [58] and also decreased the duration of grain
    filling at the reproductive stage leading to a reduction in enzyme activity and
    yield of crop [45], [59]. Maximum yield can be obtained when the crop is sown
    earlier as it received extensive duration of grain filling in comparison with
    late sowing caused warmer environment. The results obtained from our analysis
    provide a foundation for practical implementations in the agricultural domain.
    The benefits of this research lie in its potential to equip farmers and agronomists
    with valuable insights that can drive more efficient and productive agricultural
    practices. The farmers could make decisions related to crop management, resource
    allocation, and harvest planning. Moreover, optimizing crop yield predictions
    can lead to more efficient resource utilization and improved crop planning, contributing
    to increased profitability. By addressing crucial gaps and leveraging data-driven
    insights, this study has the capacity to catalyze positive transformations within
    the agricultural landscape. that can drive more efficient and productive agricultural
    practices. SECTION V. Conclusion and Future Work Accurate and timely yield prediction
    of wheat crops is essential for global food security. Towards this end, a framework
    for wheat grain yield prediction is presented in this research study. Multispectral
    data spanning the crop growth cycle from three experimental fields, each planted
    with the wheat crop at different sowing dates, is collected using drone-based
    sensors. Following the preprocessing of datasets, the most relevant predictors
    are identified and three well-known ML regression models including Random Forest,
    XGB regression, and LASSO regression are employed to estimate crop yield. The
    results show that LASSO achieved the best prediction performance with R2 of 0.93,
    and MAE of 21.72 g/m2. The annual predicted yield is found to be 260.54 g/m2,
    201.64 g/m2 and 47.29 g/m2 for the crop sown in November (SD1), December (SD2)
    and January (SD3) respectively. Additionally, the best prediction results are
    obtained from the observations made in the month of April. This research will
    help farmers and agronomists to timely and accurately estimate crop yields and
    manage crop resources prior to harvesting. At present, the estimation of wheat
    grain yield is accomplished through the use of multispectral data and machine
    learning techniques. However, in the future, we plan to explore deep learning
    techniques like CNN, LSTM, etc., to analyze drone optical data for crop yield
    forecasting. In addition, we plan to integrate more predictors like soil and climate
    data for enhancing the accuracy of yield estimation. Authors Figures References

  description: Crop response characteristics to different timescales of precipitation
    deficit may represent crop system resilience to drought characteristics. In this
    study, we assess the crop yield response of major crops to meteorological drought
    estimated by a standardized precipitation index with multiple timescales (1–12
    months) during 1981–2016 all over the globe. We estimate that about one- to two-thirds
    of global harvested areas of maize, rice, soybean, and wheat, were significantly
    affected by various drought timescales. Soybean and wheat might respond to more
    prolonged droughts, while rice and maize responded to short-medium drought time
    scales. Using multiple machine learning models, we reveal that set of determinants
    could explain most variations of crop response to drought timescale with average
    accuracies between 45.7% and 56.0% (across models and crop types). Moreover, this
    study suggests that crops in warmer and higher water availability (precipitation
    minus potential evapotranspiration) might respond significantly to more short-term
    drought. The other factors (i.e., socioeconomic, fertilizer, soil, topography,
    production, irrigation) shows a complex and weaker effect on defining crop vulnerability
    to the various drought characteristics. This study attempts to fill the gaps in
    understanding global crop resistance to different drought characteristics. The
    future challenge in understanding the multifaceted effect of physical and socioeconomic
    factors on global crop vulnerability to drought may remain and should be addressed
    in further studies.

  explanation: The study analyzes the impact of drought characterized by multiple
    meteorological time scales (drought indices with various accumulation periods)
    on major crop yields (maize, rice, soybean, and wheat) from 1981–2016 globally.
    The study reveals significant differences in crop response across different drought
    time scales. Soybean and wheat yield loss is more associated with longer drought
    time scales (6–12 months); in contrast, rice and maize yield loss responds to
    short-medium drought time scales (1–8 months). The study also investigates the
    influence of key determinants on crop response. Results indicate that temperature,
    GDP per capita, and water balance are critical parameters controlling the response
    of crop yield to drought time scales. Warmer temperatures make crops more susceptible
    to short-term drought, while higher GDP per capita in a region may determine better
    coping capacities with drought impacts. The study contributes to understanding
    the multifaceted effects of drought and climate change on crop yields.

    response characteristics to different timescales of precipitation deficit may
    represent crop system resilience to drought characteristics. In this study, we
    assess the crop yield response of major crops to meteorological drought estimated
    by a standardized precipitation index with multiple timescales (1–12 months) during
    1981–2016 all over the globe. We estimate that about one- to two-thirds of global
    harvested areas of maize, rice, soybean, and wheat, were significantly affected
    by various drought timescales. Soybean and wheat might respond to more prolonged
    droughts, while rice and maize responded to short-medium drought time scales.
    Using multiple machine learning models, we reveal that set of determinants could
    explain most variations of crop response to drought timescale with average accuracies
    between 45.7% and 56.0% (across models and crop types). Moreover, this study suggests

    droughtCrop yieldCrop-drought determinantsDrought timescales 1. Introduction Drought
    risk is a serious problem affecting losses and damages in many sectors, such as
    agriculture (e.g., crop losses), environment (e.g., wildfire), and socioeconomic
    sectors (e.g., famine, human loss, poverty) (Heim, 2002, Mishra and Singh, 2010,
    Wilhite and Glantz, 1985). Agriculture, particularly crops, is one of the most
    affected sectors by drought. As one of the extreme climate phenomena, drought
    can control crop yield variation by causing a lack of water availability, low
    plant development, and accordingly causing crop yield reduction or failure (Daryanto
    et al., 2016, Lu et al., 2017). Drought can be identified as four different types:
    meteorological, agricultural, hydrological, and socioeconomic drought, which is
    represented by precipitation deficit, soil moisture triggering lack of water supply
    to crops, streamflow deficit (i.e., low water level reservoir and groundwater
    deficit), and water supply deficit affecting the society as a subsequent impact
    of the drought (Spinoni et al., 2014, Wilhite and Glantz, 1985). Meteorological
    drought is the first adverse consequence of the natural water deficit triggered
    by a lack of precipitation (Guo et al., 2020, Zargar et al., 2011). Different
    accumulated precipitation deficits over time can induce different impacts on each
    terrestrial system. For example, an accumulated precipitation deficit over 1-month
    may induce soil moisture and crop stress during the growing season, while a 12-month
    precipitation deficit may trigger reservoir and groundwater level depletion (Spinoni
    et al., 2014, Zargar et al., 2011). The drought timescale may be used to understand
    crop vulnerability to drought, as different crop systems may respond to drought
    in a unique process (Barker et al., 2016, Zargar et al., 2011). The drought timescale
    may be used to understand crop vulnerability to drought, as different crop systems
    may respond to drought in a unique process (Barker et al., 2016). The drought
    impact on crops depends on how drought is defined and is related to the drought
    timescale, duration, and severity (McKee et al., 1993), as well as the character
    of each crop’s resistance (Chaves et al., 2003, Daryanto et al., 2016). Previous
    studies have assessed crop drought impact using multiple drought timescales (Peña-Gallardo
    et al., 2019a, Swain et al., 2022a, Vicente-Serrano et al., 2012, Zhang et al.,
    2019). A drought timescale can be referred to as the time (e.g., months) during
    which the event develops (Hayes, 2001). Drought indices with multiple timescales
    have been used to define a specific drought event for various terrestrial systems
    (Mishra and Singh, 2010, Zargar et al., 2011). Among them are the Standardized
    Precipitation Index (SPI) (McKee et al., 1993) and Standardized Precipitation
    Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) (Vicente-Serrano et al., 2010) have been more
    extensively used in local or global scale studies. SPI is defined as a meteorological
    drought with precipitation as the input and is recommended by the World Meteorological
    Organization (WMO) for drought monitoring (Hayes et al., 2011). SPEI was developed
    by Vicente-Serrano et al. (2010), using precipitation and evapotranspiration as
    inputs, considering the important meteorological component other than precipitation.
    Previous studies have compared their skill to identify drought periods for various
    applications (Guttman, 1998, Hoffmann et al., 2020, Mishra and Singh, 2010). Some
    studies indicated the advantage of SPI due to a simple drought representation
    as the other drought index may require additional variables (i.e., evapotranspiration),
    which are not widely available and can introduce more complex drought parameterization
    (Hoffmann et al., 2020, Trenberth et al., 2014). Nonetheless, particularly for
    agricultural applications, SPEI can also be used as it considers temperature to
    indicate evaporative demand as one of the important parameters for crop development
    (Lobell and Field, 2007, Matiu et al., 2017, Peña-Gallardo et al., 2019b). Most
    studies have linked different drought timescales to vegetation response using
    several vegetation activity indicators to obtain which drought timescale and period
    are impactful to vegetation (Vicente-Serrano et al., 2013, Xu et al., 2018). However,
    the application of a multiscalar drought index for detecting crop anomalies using
    yield data on a global scale was sparse. Most of the studies were conducted in
    a local or regional study using aggregated crop yield statistics on a sub-country
    scale (e.g., city, county, province) (Bachmair et al., 2018, Peña-Gallardo et
    al., 2019b, Zipper et al., 2016). The spatially explicit global-scale analysis
    was still limited due to global crop yield data availability in a finer resolution
    (i.e., grid-scale) (Kim et al., 2019). The most widely used dataset for global-scale
    analysis was either country-level yield statistics from The Food and Agriculture
    Organization of the United Nations (FAO) (Lobell and Field, 2007, Vicente-Serrano
    et al., 2012) or yield data from crop growth modeling (Wang et al., 2017). Currently,
    a gridded global dataset of historical yields for major crops has been developed
    for the major crops (maize, rice, soybean, and wheat) (Iizumi et al., 2014, Iizumi
    and Sakai, 2020). This dataset allows us to extract valuable crop yield anomalies
    due to various impacts (i.e., drought) in a more spatially explicit way rather
    than on an aggregated scale. Furthermore, while there have been many field-based
    and local studies on determining factors influencing crop yield response to drought,
    there are limited global-scale studies providing pieces of evidence on potential
    determinants by which drought stress accumulates in crops and reduces crop productivity
    (Peña-Gallardo et al., 2019b, Yang et al., 2020). Previous studies have shown
    that the impact of drought on crops can be influenced by various factors, including
    crop type, climate, soil, and irrigation practices (Daryanto et al., 2016, Fahad
    et al., 2017). Understanding how drought propagates to affect crop yield at different
    timescales, and identifying the potential determinants that underlie this process,
    could help to develop more effective strategies for mitigating the impact of drought
    on crop productivity. This study is aimed to assess how crops respond to various
    drought characterization (i.e., timescales) as a measure of crop system resilience
    (and adaptive capacity). We utilized various determinants, e.g., climate, soil,
    environment, agricultural input, and socioeconomic factors, which may determine
    crop system’s vulnerability under climatic stress (i.e., drought). Specifically,
    we set the objectives of this study: (1) assessing which timescale crops primarily
    respond to drought, (2) mapping their spatial patterns, and (3) finding key determinants
    that control the pattern of crop response to different drought timescales. Here,
    drought is represented by a multiscalar meteorological drought index SPI with
    1 – 12-month timescales based on the global gridded precipitation datasets. All
    analysis was done for each major crop (maize, rice, soybean, and wheat) in 0.5°
    grid resolution from 1981 to 2016 (36 years). This study elucidates the extent
    to which multifaceted physical and socioeconomic factors play an important role
    in building up the resilience of crop systems to droughts. Furthermore, this has
    implications for future adaptation and mitigation measures toward sustainable
    futures under pressured agricultural systems with an important commitment to achieve
    zero poverty and hunger of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030 (United
    Nations, 2015). 2. Materials 2.1. Yield anomaly We used the global dataset of
    historical yields for major crops (GDHY) developed by (Iizumi and Sakai, 2020)
    for maize, rice, wheat, and soybean. GDHY provides gridded crop yield data (tons
    per hectare, t ha-1) with 0.5° spatial resolution over 1981–2016, calculated based
    on crop yield statistics (FAOSTAT), remote sensing data, and other crop-related
    datasets (i.e., crop calendar, crop harvested area). To obtain year-to-year growing
    season drought, we used a global crop calendar model developed based on the year
    2000 (Sacks et al., 2010). 2.2. Precipitation We used several available precipitation
    datasets to estimate the ensemble mean of global drought events based on SPI on
    a monthly scale with a spatial and temporal scale similar to the global yield
    dataset. Nine publicly available datasets suiting the spatial and temporal resolution
    criteria were employed. The selected datasets consist of five-gauge observation-based
    data (GPCC, CRU, PRECL, UDEL, CPC), one merging-based data (MSWEP), and three
    reanalysis data (MERRA-2, ERA-5, JRA-55). Further details of the datasets used
    in the drought indicator development are provided (Hendrawan et al., 2022). 2.3.
    Key determinant datasets We obtained global datasets of various variables that
    are widely known to control agricultural production (i.e., crop yield) and its
    response pattern to climatic-related stress (i.e., drought). These variables were
    used to identify the spatial variation of crop response as a proxy for assessing
    agroecosystem vulnerability patterns over regions. We defined the possible determinants
    as climate (Lobell and Field, 2007), topography (Lychuk et al., 2017), soil (Iizumi
    et al., 2021), irrigation (Carrão et al., 2016, Meza et al., 2020), crop production
    (Williams et al., 2016), fertilizer (Simelton et al., 2012, Yamoah et al., 2000),
    and socioeconomic factors (Simelton et al., 2009, Swain et al., 2022b) (Table
    1). The datasets were re-gridded to the common grid resolution of 0.5° following
    crop yield and the drought dataset. The temporal coverage of datasets is within
    the study period (1981–2016), depending on each data availability. Table 1. The

    TS v. 4.05 dataset (Harris et al., 2020) of total precipitation, daily Potential
    Evapotranspiration (PET), and daily mean temperature on a monthly scale. We calculated
    the inter-annual total value for precipitation and daily mean PET and temperature
    from 1981 to 2016, corresponding to the yield and drought period analyzed in this
    study. Then, we used the water balance indicator by subtracting the mean annual
    total precipitation (P) with PET (P-PET) to indicate the simple net water availability
    within the land. 2.3.2. Topography factors Terrain attributes were used to indicate
    the general pattern of soil, fertility, and moisture availability (wetness) (Lychuk
    et al., 2017, Zeleke and Bing, 2004). This study used a global elevation dataset
    from IIASA and FAO (IIASA/FAO, 2010), generated by digital elevation data (DEM)
    from The NASA Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (SRTM) and GTOPO30 (USGS, 2002).
    2.3.3. Soil factors We employed the outermost layer of the soil indicators: hydraulic
    conductivity and available water capacity. We used the 30 cm saturated hydraulic
    conductivity (Ks) data from Montzka et al. (2017), based on the Schaap algorithm
    (Schaap, 2002) and SoilGrids1km dataset (Hengl et al., 2014). Furthermore, we
    used plant-extractable soil water capacity for the available water capacity indicator,
    developed by global soil profile (texture and depth), organic matter, and plant
    rooting depth (Dunne and Willmott, 1996). 2.3.4. Irrigation factors The irrigation
    rate indicator was represented by the global data set of crop-specific monthly
    irrigated and rainfed crop areas around the year 2000 (MIRCA2000). We obtained
    annual irrigated harvested areas to indicate to what extent harvested areas are
    irrigated (km2) for each crop (maize, rice, soybean, and wheat) among the 26 crop
    types MIRCA2000 provided. 2.3.5. Production factors The total harvested area to
    represent the crop system’s characteristics (i.e., farm size) (Williams et al.,
    2016) was used. The harvested area was obtained based on the MIRCA2000 as the
    total of annual irrigated and rainfed areas for each crop (Portmann et al., 2010).
    2.3.6. Fertilizer factors The fertilizer application rate dataset from the crop-specific
    global fertilizer application rates (Mueller et al., 2012) was employed. This
    dataset estimated the fertilizer application rate for each crop based on the national-level
    statistics of fertilizer application rates, crop yield map (Monfreda et al., 2008),
    and livestock and manure nutrient content distribution. This study used the potassium
    input rate, which was reported to have a role in mitigating crop drought stress
    (Studer et al., 2017). 2.3.7. Socioeconomic factors We used gross domestic product
    (GDP) per capita as a proxy indicating the level of capital investment in agriculture
    associated with crop yield vulnerability to a stressor (Kim et al., 2019, Simelton
    et al., 2009). GDP data (PPP, i.e., purchasing power parity) was obtained from
    Kummu et al. (2018) based on sub-national and national data. We selected the data
    layer of the year 2015 as a representative period coinciding with this study period.
    3. Methods 3.1. SPI calculation SPI was calculated solely based on monthly precipitation
    time series. First monthly precipitation data were fitted to gamma distribution
    and then transformed to a standardized value based on the standard normal distribution
    (mean 0 standard deviations 1) (Guttman, 1998, McKee et al., 1993). The complete
    procedures can be referred to (Lloyd-Hughes and Saunders, 2002). The positive
    SPI values represent a wet condition or rainfall surplus; the negative values
    indicate a dry condition or rainfall deficit relative to the long-term average
    associated with the total calculation period. This calculation was done independently
    for each grid cell; thus, SPI can be spatially comparable as standardization was
    done based on the climatology in each location. In this study, drought timescale
    ( ) refers to different SPI timescale, which was calculated from various moving
    average of monthly precipitation. Here we used a timescale from 1 to 12 months
    ( = 1, …, 12) considering the various response of crops from meteorological (shorter
    term) to hydrological drought (longer term) (Lloyd-Hughes and Saunders, 2002,
    Wilhite and Glantz, 1985). The SPI calculation was done according to Hendrawan
    et al. (2022) by employing an ensemble precipitation dataset. First, SPI was generated
    using each precipitation dataset (GPCC, CRU, PRECL, UDEL, CPC, MSWEP, MERRA-2,
    ERA-5, JRA-55), and subsequently, the average was calculated across SPIs. This
    average SPI is then referred to as the ensemble SPI, which represents the drought
    index in this study. We employed SPI because of several reasons. First, we limit
    uncertainties caused by larger input parameters that might be used to develop
    the drought indicator (i.e., evapotranspiration calculation needed for SPEI).
    In addition, the use of more variables would complicate drought index development
    since we used ensemble SPI from multiple global precipitation data (see Hendrawan
    et al., 2022). Second, it is a simple and flexible indicator while giving robust
    drought representation comparable with other complex drought indicators. Finally,
    SPI has been used widely for drought monitoring and suggested by World Meteorological
    Organization (WMO) (Hayes et al., 2011). 3.2. Drought intensity Drought intensity
    ) was calculated based on the calculated SPI with various timescales. Then the
    monthly SPI along 1981–2016 (432 months) were used to represent annual drought
    conditions based on harvesting months obtained from the crop calendar dataset
    (Sacks et al., 2010). We adopted the drought magnitude definition by McKee et
    al. (1993)) as a function of SPI and drought duration ( ). Following the previous
    study (Kim et al., 2019), here we set the fixed drought duration as three months
    ( =3) during and before harvesting (i.e., the harvest month and the two months
    earlier) (see Eq. 1 and Supplementary Fig. S1 in Appendix). We then considered
    using a measure of drought intensity ( ) as an average of SPI with during the
    above period to keep the standardized value range (i.e., mean 0 and standard deviation
    1). was calculated in each grid cell as (1) where is the SPI of -month precipitation
    accumulation in month in year and H is the harvesting month (Sacks et al., 2010).
    For instance, with = 8 (August) is calculated based on three months average of
    -month SPI within June, July, and August in 2015 (see Supplementary Fig. S1).
    As we multiplied SPI with minus one, the higher positive drought intensity indicates
    a higher drought magnitude that might adversely affect crop yield loss. Moreover,
    as suggested in Kim et al. (2019), we only used indicating drought conditions.
    3.3. Crop yield anomaly The exclusion of long-term trend of crop yield time series
    data as a technological yield increase is necessary to obtain crop yield anomaly
    due to short-term climate disruptions. Crop yield anomaly (ΔY) was calculated
    by a detrended time series based on a locally weighted regression method (Eq.
    2) (Cleveland and Devlin, 1988). This method was selected to detrend yield data
    as it can account for possible trend non-linearity and is considered appropriate
    for a limited time series period (Hendrawan et al., 2022, Lu et al., 2017). (2)
    ̅ ̅ where is crop yield (t /ha) and ̅ is the long-term trend obtained by locally
    weighted regression (t /ha). For the window size or span ( parameter) used in
    the local regression, we used one-fourth of all data series for all grids (Hendrawan
    et al., 2022). 3.4. Assessing the crop response pattern to drought timescale We
    first assessed the relationship between multiple timescales ( =1, …,12) and crop
    yield anomaly for the four crop types using the Pearson correlation. Thus, we
    obtained 12 (timescales) × 4 (crops) correlations in each grid cell and obtained
    timescale, which reveals the maximum squared Pearson correlation coefficient (
    ), indicating the most crop yield sensitivity to drought (Hendrawan et al., 2022,
    Peña-Gallardo et al., 2019b). Then, we obtained the global map of the most correlated
    drought timescale and its associated Pearson correlation value in each grid (
    < 0.05). We further classified the most correlated drought timescale into three
    categories: short (1 – 4 months), medium (5 – 8 months), and long (9 – 12 months).
    This classification allows us to extract the spatial pattern of crop response
    to different drought lag times, indicating crop resistance and resilience to different
    drought characteristics (Vicente-Serrano et al., 2013). 3.5. Climate characteristics
    We obtained the climatic region’s characteristics which might be associated with
    the pattern of crop response to different drought time scales. Here we used the
    classification of the climatic region based on precipitation pattern: tropical,
    temperate, continental, and arid, according to the Köppen-Geiger climate classification
    (Kottek et al., 2006). 3.6. Machine learning models We employed several machine
    learning algorithms for classification: Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting
    (XGBoost), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to assess the dependence between key
    factors and the responses of crops to different timescales. These particular machine-learning
    algorithms have been growingly utilized in previous studies to understand the
    relationship between multiple variables (e.g., climate hazard) and dependent indicators
    (e.g., environmental risk) (Beillouin et al., 2020, Vogel et al., 2019). We trained
    models using several input determinants as classifiers and the three categories
    of crop response to drought timescales (short, medium, and long) as response variables
    for each crop separately. In this study, RF, SVM, and XGBoost were applied using
    the “caret” library in R (Kuhn, 2008) with “ranger”, “svmRadial”, and “xgbTree”
    methods, respectively. We optimized the model based on the training accuracy metric
    from the 10-fold cross-validation with validation (leave-group out) of 25% of
    the data. Then we ranked the importance of variables calculated within the model
    using the variable importance method using the same library. Finally, we obtained
    the relationship between key variables and the crop response to drought timescale
    by constructing the “Partial Dependence Plot” using the “pdp” R library (Greenwell,
    2017). The partial dependence for this purpose (classification) reveals the relationship
    between the probability of valid votes (0−1) for each class (short, medium, long)
    and the associated value for each variable predictor. This study utilized the
    average value of the results from RF, SVM, and XGBoost of the model accuracies,
    variable importance, and partial dependence plots to get the central tendency
    across the different machine learning models. 3.6.1. Random Forest Random Forest
    (RF) uses a decision trees ensemble formerly developed by Breiman (2001). The
    accuracy indicator of the model was calculated based on “out-of-bag” data or test
    (validation) data when the model was fitted using the training data. To reveal
    the variable importance of each factor in determining crop response to drought
    timescales, we used the “Mean Decrease Gini” metric representing the reduction
    of the model accuracy when each variable is removed; the higher the mean decrease
    accuracy value, the higher the variable importance in the model. In this study,
    we applied the model using the default hyperparameter inputs: e.g., the number
    of trees of 500 and maximum tree depth of 5 (Kuhn, 2008). 3.6.2. Extreme Gradient
    Boosting The Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm (Chen and Guestrin,
    2016) is a further development of the Gradient Boosting Algorithms Machine, which
    is based on regression tree proposed by Friedman (2001). The idea of gradient
    boosting methods is to improve the model''s accuracy by employing the negative
    gradient direction of the function of model loss (Friedman, 2001). Here, we implemented
    XGBoost with the number of gradients boosted trees by 500 with the maximum tree
    depth of 5 and learning rate of 0.3. 3.6.3. Support Vector Machine The Support
    Vector Machine (SVM) uses kernels by minimizing the distance to training data
    and limiting the model complexity (Boser et al., 1992). Here, the SVM algorithm
    was based on the radial basis function, which generally had two input parameters:
    1) the penalty factor (C) aiming to find a trade-off between the fitting error
    and the model complexity and the kernel width (gamma). In this study, we applied
    SVM with the input set C= 1 and gamma= 0.1. We use default hyperparameter inputs
    for each machine learning model as it is adequate to reveal general linkages between
    determinants and crop response, as reported by previous studies (Hendrawan et
    al., 2023, Iizumi et al., 2021). However, it is also important to note that machine
    learning models can also be sensitive to the choice of kernel function and susceptible
    to overfitting when the training data is too complex or noisy. 4. Results 4.1.
    Crop response to drought timescales The yield loss is associated significantly
    with the drought in various timescales over the major global crop areas by 55%,
    27%, 65%, and 65% of global cropland for maize, rice, soybean, and wheat, respectively.
    Fig. 1 shows the spatial distribution of the most correlated timescale categories.
    Overall, aggregated across crops, the result shows that shorter drought timescale
    was slightly more profound to crops (37% of total global cropland for maize, rice,
    soybean, and wheat) than long (34%) and medium (29%) timescale. For each crop,
    maize may respond to medium drought timescales more (20% of global cropland),
    while soybean and wheat tend to respond to longer timescales (24% and 27%, respectively).
    On the other hand, rice tends to respond to shorter timescales (13%) despite less
    cropland significantly affected by drought. This implies that the main driver
    of crop yield loss for rice might be complex and not necessarily correlated to
    meteorological drought events. Download : Download high-res image (495KB) Download

    correlated with crop yield anomaly for maize, rice, soybean, and wheat. Drought
    timescales (1–12 months) are aggregated into short (1 – 4 months), medium (5 –
    8 months), and long (9 – 12 months). Grids with no significant correlations (
    ≥ 0.05) are represented by grey masks, while grids with no cropland or yield data
    are shown in white. Pie charts show the global crop area aggregate weighted by
    MIRCA2000. Furthermore, the linkage between drought with different timescales
    and crop yield anomaly was strong in some regions. Generally, the Great Plains
    and the Pampas had a prominent crop yield sensitivity to longer drought timescale.
    In particular, maize was sensitive to longer drought timescales in the Iberian
    Peninsula, Morocco, and south-eastern Europe, while the response to short and
    medium timescales are found in Southern Africa, Mideastern US, and Indonesia.
    On the other hand, the soybean and wheat response to a long drought timescale
    was also profound and sparse in Northeast China, part of Northern Kazakhstan,
    and a small part of Eastern Africa. Particular soybean responses to short-term
    drought are in India, the Great Plains, and Pampas. For wheat, the crop yield,
    which was sensitive to medium and shorter drought timescales, can be found in
    Eastern Europe and Australia. On the other hand, rice shows sparse regions sensitive
    to drought timescale with a tendency of shorter response in Africa. Based on the
    climate classification, the result in Fig. 2 shows that crop response to drought
    varies moderately depending on the crop types among different climatic regions.
    Results show Maize in the temperate climate sensitivity to medium drought timescales
    becomes more dominant, but a slightly different response in the other climate
    regions. Rice tends to show a short-term response to drought for all climate regions,
    especially tropical and temperate climates where rice is mostly grown. Soybean
    generally exhibits a more diverse response, where a short and medium response
    was dominant in temperate climates, while continental climates tend to be more
    sensitive to longer drought timescales. Wheat tends to respond to longer drought
    timescales for all climate regions except the tropics. Arid and continental regions
    generally respond to longer drought timescales, while temperate and tropical regions
    were influenced by short to medium drought timescales (except in wheat). As the
    major environments for global crops, temperate climates were mostly exposed to
    drought, given more dominant global harvested area shares. Download : Download

    dataset. 4.2. Comparison with local drought cases Here, we compare drought events
    estimated in this study with the previous local studies in the selected region
    of interest. For instance, Fig. 3a shows the relationship between maize yield
    anomaly and drought, with the most-correlated timescales in Southeast Africa.
    The drought events analyzed in this study capture several most extreme droughts
    in the recent decades, associated with El Nino events, especially during 1991/1992
    and 1994/1995 in several countries: Malawi, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Mozambique, and
    Swaziland (Belbase and Morgan, 1994, Tschirley, 1998). This drought episode corresponds
    to a significant crop yield loss of maize in the region, as confirmed in reported
    data (Devereux and Næraa, 1996, Eldridge, 2002). Download : Download high-res

    for several selected regions shown in the red box in the right panel. The right
    y-axis showing is inverted to give a clear association between crop yield anomaly
    and drought severity. Yield anomaly and values are weighted based on MIRCA2000.
    Rice shows no clear spatial pattern of the crop response to each drought timescale.
    However, the dominant pattern, the short response, can be observed in southern
    African countries such as Mali and Chad (see Fig. 1). Moreover, Fig. 3b shows
    the sample region in Indonesia in the case of rice crop, showing a generally longer
    response to drought, even though globally rice mostly responds to shorter drought
    timescale. The drought events in this region analyzed in this study were associated
    with El Nino occurrences, such as in 1997/1998, 2002/2003, and 2013/2014. These
    drought events also trigger crop yield drops over the years, as widely reported
    in previous studies (D’Arrigo et al., 2006). The long response of drought affecting
    crop yield anomaly for soybean was shown in the arid region of The Great Plain,
    the Pampas, northern Italy, and South Africa. On the other hand, the short to
    medium soybean response was sparsely shown in the soybean croplands, such as in
    the US, South America, and China. Fig. 3c shows drought events and their associated
    crop yield loss in The Pampas area, demonstrating a strong linkage between medium
    and long drought timescale and crop yield anomaly (right panel). The left panel
    figure shows several major drought events, such as in 1988/1989, 1996/1997, and
    2008/2009, corresponding to significant crop yield loss in the region. The drought
    and its implication on crop yield during the periods were also reported in previous
    studies (Lovino et al., 2014, Sgroi et al., 2021). A longer response dominates
    most wheat cropland in south-eastern Australia, northern Kazakhstan, the Iberian
    Peninsula, Morocco, and Ethiopia. On the other hand, the medium to short response
    can be found marginally in the rest of the significant crop-drought areas (e.g.,
    France, Germany, UK). Fig. 3d shows the example region of Southeast Australia,
    which poses a long response to drought. Based on the report and previous studies,
    drought episodes and crop yield losses in this study correspond to the actual
    extreme drought conditions, such as in 1982, 1994, 2002, and 2006 in the region
    (Nicholls, 2004, van Dijk et al., 2013). 4.3. Key factors of crop response to
    drought timescales Machine learning models could explain around half of the spatial
    variability of crop response to drought timescales shown in Fig. 1, with average
    accuracies ranging between 45.7% and 56.0% (Table 2). This result suggests no
    substantial difference in the model‘s performance across the combinations (i.e.,
    algorithms and crop types). The models generally show a moderate to higher predictive
    capacity of the key variables in determining the crop response. Among the algorithm,
    Random Forest reveals better predictability, followed by XGBoost and SVM. Among
    the models, the performance for all four crops is quite similar, although rice
    tends to have lower accuracy. It is noteworthy that the performance of the machine
    learning models might not align with the results of the relationship between various
    drought timescales and crop yield anomaly. The similar performance of the machine
    learning models for all four crops may reflect the capability of the algorithm
    to capture any relationships between input features and crop response to various
    drought timescales. Nevertheless, it is important to exercise caution when interpreting
    results for rice, considering its lower correlation with drought. Table 2. Machine
    learning model accuracy for each crop based on Random Forest, Support Vector Machine,
    and Extreme Gradient Boosting. Algorithm Accuracy Maize Rice Soybean Wheat RF

    49.5% Mean 49.3% 48.7% 50.5% 48.8% Furthermore, from the relative importance of
    variables to the model (Fig. 4), overall, we reveal that temperature, GDP per
    capita, and water balance are among the most influential parameters determining
    crop response to different drought timescales. The result indicates the importance
    of climate and socioeconomic factors in determining crop response. The result
    among these three important variables is relatively robust across the algorithm
    and crop type (see Supplementary Fig. S2). Meanwhile, the remaining factors (i.e.,
    hydraulic conductivity, harvested area, topography, fertilizer, water-holding
    capacity, and irrigation) relatively play a lesser significant role in determining
    crop response to drought, despite more variations depending on the machine learning
    algorithm used and the type of crop. Download : Download high-res image (287KB)

    the importance order (most to least important). Colored bars denote the crop-wise
    average importance scaled from 0 to 1 (colors indicate different classes), while
    the black points indicate the individual machine learning output (RF, SVM, XGBoost).
    We further examine the functional relationship between determinants and the response
    categories (short, medium, and long) based on the partial dependence plots. Fig.
    5 shows the model dependence from the average value resulting from RF, SVM, and
    XGBoost models on each variable; the positive value of the y-axis indicates higher
    accurate vote proportions given a change of variable values, that is, higher predictability.
    Here, we only show variable dependence based on their predictability to the short
    drought timescale to demonstrate the effect of each variable in the models (see
    Supplementary Fig. S3 and S4 for the medium and long drought timescale, respectively).

    to short drought timescales based on the model''s average (RF, SVM, XGBoost).
    The y-axis indicates the probability of accurate votes given a change in the variable
    values. A higher positive y-axis denotes stronger evidence of which variable''s
    value ranges are likely to define the crop response to the drought timescale.
    The line curves are smoothed based on the local polynomial regression to obtain
    the general tendency of the partial dependence (span=0.5). As shown in Fig. 5,
    for the most influential factor, temperature, the higher value (y-axis) tends
    to control crop response to a short drought timescale, while rice shows the opposite
    response. This may imply that crops in a warmer climate respond relatively as
    soon as a short-term drought develops. On the other hand, crops in a colder climate
    may be more sensitive to longer-term accumulated precipitation shortage (Supplementary
    Fig. S4). This also signifies a stronger drought impact and immediate crop response
    to drought across equatorial and tropical croplands (mostly humid) that typically
    have a higher temperature over the years, consistent with those in Fig. 2, showing
    that tropical crops likely respond more to shorter drought. The other climate
    parameter dependence, the water balance, similarly suggests that cropland with
    higher water availability (i.e., net positive precipitation over potential evapotranspiration)
    seems more susceptible to the shorter timescale. Nevertheless, this may imply
    that crops in semi-arid and arid regions respond to longer drought events than
    in humid-tropical regions, given their better adaptation to immediate drought
    shocks in the dry environment. These results are similar to those in Fig. 2; wheat
    mostly cultivated in drier environments exhibits a longer response to drought.
    The other most important factor, GDP per capita, tends to be associated with a
    short drought timescale within its lower value, especially for maize. This suggests
    that maize yield tends to respond to short-term drought quickly in a lower-capita
    income region. However, these variations of the GDP per capita dependence across
    crops show a complex effect of GDP per capita in determining crop vulnerability
    to different drought characteristics. Therefore, this study’s result is apart
    from a conclusion about whether GDP per capita can significantly influence crop
    drought vulnerability. Meanwhile, the remaining factors are less relevant, even
    though some variables show a stronger relationship for a specific model and crop.
    These variables with moderate effect on the models (i.e., hydraulic conductivity,
    harvested area, topography, fertilizer rate, water holding capacity) show a wider
    variation depending on the algorithm used and crop type, while the irrigation
    factor shows relatively weak importance among models. 5. Discussion This present
    study investigates crop yield anomaly response to different drought timescales
    based on SPI with multiple timescales (1–12 months). We found that temperate,
    continental, and arid regions might face significant yield loss due to drought
    than tropical regions, in agreement with the previous studies’ findings (Kim et
    al., 2019, Lesk et al., 2021, Ray et al., 2015). Therefore, crops are strongly
    exposed to such drought episodes, giving more crop susceptibility to damage (Schwabe
    et al., 2013). In temperate regions, an intermittent drought might also threaten
    crops that are not well adapted to drought than those in an arid region. Previous
    studies have reported that drought in a temperate region can be intensified under
    climate warming (Schlaepfer et al., 2017). In the continental region, the drought
    significance to crops might be related to prolonged winter drought hampering soil
    moisture supply by reducing snowmelt before the spring and summer growing seasons
    (Gevaert et al., 2018, Hamal et al., 2020). Furthermore, we compared our results
    with the local studies, indicating that the drought estimation in this study generally
    corresponds with the actual drought impact on crop production reported. Based
    on the highest correlation between crop yield anomaly and various drought timescales,
    we suggest maize, soybean, and wheat might be more sensitive to medium to long-term
    drought; rice responds to short-term drought, despite a lower correlation. These
    results may be related to the impact of prolonged drought in most dryland environments,
    triggering a lack of soil moisture and water storage and limiting water supply
    in an irrigated system (Wilhite and Glantz, 1985, Zargar et al., 2011). Previous
    studies also emphasize the relevance of medium to longer timescales on a local
    or global scale. For example, (Peña-Gallardo et al., 2019a) found that wheat was
    more sensitive to medium to longer timescale drought based on SPEI during spring
    and winter in Spain and the US (4–18 months) (Peña-Gallardo et al., 2019b), despite
    high variability across crops and drought seasonality. On a global scale, previous
    studies found a high correlation between medium drought timescales (∼6 months)
    using SPI or SPEI and crop production using sub-county level data (Kim et al.,
    2019, Vogel et al., 2019, Zampieri et al., 2017). In addition, it is notable that
    rice exhibits a lower correlated harvested area with drought. One possible explanation
    for this could be the sensitivity of rice to other factors, such as temperature,
    soil moisture, and irrigation (Hendrawan et al., 2022, Kim et al., 2019, Lobell
    and Field, 2007). These factors could also be affecting the rice yield and masking
    the direct impact of drought on the crop. Additionally, there could be regional
    variations in the relationship as rice in some regions may be more susceptible
    to drought (e.g., rainfed rice), while others may be less affected due to differences
    in environment and water management practices. Therefore, results for rice should
    be treated with care, especially in understanding the key drivers for this particular
    crop, given the previous study indicating a complex effect of drought on this
    typical wet farming crop (Irawan et al., 2023). Previous studies, mostly on a
    local scale using finer resolution data (i.e., county, sub-county level), suggest
    the importance of short-term drought for several crops (Peña-Gallardo et al.,
    2019b, Sgroi et al., 2021, Zipper et al., 2016). For instance, Sgroi et al. (2021)
    indicate that overall wheat, maize, and soybean yields were sensitive to drought
    periods shorter than three months during summer (maize and soybean) and spring
    (wheat). However, the previous studies mainly detect the most correlated timescales
    by varying seasonality (i.e., different months or seasons); thus, the most correlated
    timescale depends on the timing at which drought is calculated. This study used
    the fixed season to calculate drought to reflect only the growing season drought
    accumulated in harvest month. Moreover, the scale discrepancy between global and
    local studies may result in different representations of extreme drought severity
    and yield anomaly since hazard and crop response on finer spatial scales tend
    to be averaged out at lower resolution (Eggert et al., 2015). The difference in
    each crop’s response to a drought timescale may reflect different crop resistance
    with corresponding climate characteristics. For instance, in the wheat case, the
    dominant response may be related to the relatively long growing season and the
    importance of soil moisture recharge, especially during the critical season, as
    indicated by previous studies (Peña-Gallardo et al., 2019b, Sgroi et al., 2021).
    The significance of medium to longer drought may be because crops in arid and
    semi-arid regions generally can adapt to shorter water shortages due to internal
    strategies increasing crop efficiency to such abiotic stress (Chaves et al., 2003,
    Daryanto et al., 2016). Moreover, this present study indicates a similar response
    pattern between maize and soybean, typically having a shorter growing season than
    wheat. We suggest these crops respond to generally medium-term drought, agreeing
    that previous studies reporting short to medium-term drought during important
    timing (i.e., late spring to summer) might harm crop yield (Peña-Gallardo et al.,
    2019b, Sgroi et al., 2021, Zipper et al., 2016). In contrast, rice tends to respond
    to shorter droughts in most climate regions. This may be related to the common
    characteristics of the wet crops with poorer adaptability to abrupt water shortage,
    given their common favor from water availability (Jongdee et al., 2006, Vicente-Serrano
    et al., 2013). Further, it may be because propagation of meteorological drought
    (i.e., SPI) to the land occurs at shorter timescales in tropical climates than
    in continental or arid climates (Gevaert et al., 2018). Based on soil moisture
    data, (Sheffield and Wood, 2007) also indicate that short-timescale droughts (≤
    6 months) were more predominant in tropical regions and mid-latitudes due to high
    inter-annual climate variability. However, crops'' response to tropical regions
    with abundant water resources may depend on the extent to which irrigation can
    buffer during meteorological drought stress (Zipper et al., 2016). We linked the
    variability of crop responses to different drought timescales with several possible
    determinants. We found that temperature, GDP per capita, and water balance are
    among the most important global parameters defining the crop response pattern.
    These parameters are considered key parameters to drive agricultural productivity
    and the vulnerability of the crop system to disruptions (Fraser et al., 2013,
    Kim et al., 2019, Lesk et al., 2021). Particularly, we suggest that crop tends
    to be damaged in warmer to hot regions by short-term drought. Warmer temperatures
    generally prompt higher evaporation with drier conditions in low precipitation
    periods than cooler conditions. Previous studies also indicated that the impact
    of extreme drought could be more exaggerated by extreme heat (i.e., joint hot
    and dry conditions), contributing to severe moisture stress, especially under
    global warming (Coffel et al., 2019, Lesk et al., 2021, Matiu et al., 2017, Vogel
    et al., 2019). Crops, particularly maize, in regions with higher GDP per capita
    are more sensitive to short-term drought, while the other crops suggest the opposite
    response. Previous studies suggested that resilient crop systems were strongly
    related to a high GDP per capita in agriculture (Simelton et al., 2009); that
    is, lower resilience, in this case, may determine the lower capability of crop
    systems to cope with the abrupt climate disruption (i.e., short term drought).
    On the other hand, a study by Lesk et al. (2016) suggests that crop production
    in more developed countries (i.e., higher income) might be more vulnerable to
    drought events, confirming part of our study findings. One of the possible reasons
    is the tendency of developing farmers to maintain low-risk production. In addition,
    small-scale farmers may have traditional farming practices that make them adapt
    to climatic variability. Nonetheless, GDP per capita can be a proxy of agricultural
    investment related to infrastructure, machinery used, fertilizer input, farm scale,
    etc. (Simelton et al., 2012, Stringer et al., 2020). Therefore, for the sensitive
    regions, promoting capital investments into agricultural inputs may partly buffer
    short or longer-term drought losses or damages (Kim et al., 2019). Moreover, in
    this present study, we could not detect the importance of the irrigation parameter,
    even though this factor is widely known as a factor playing a big role in reducing
    the impact of drought and extreme heat (Lesk et al., 2021, Troy et al., 2015,
    Vogel et al., 2019). One possible reason is that crop yield data used in this
    study is not separated between irrigated and rainfed systems (i.e., annual mean),
    which introduces a mixed response given that each irrigated and rainfed share
    the annual mean yield of a grid cell. Here, we might argue that the irrigation
    fraction variability under a predominantly rainfed system is insufficient to buffer
    drought impact, especially due to more intensive droughts during which irrigation
    supply is highly constrained (Leng, 2021). Further studies on a global scale may
    address this study’s limitation by, for example, providing separated crop yield
    data under irrigated and rainfed growing seasons and comparing each drought impact
    under different conditions, as suggested by previous work (Hendrawan et al., 2023).
    Finally, our study provides important insights into the relationship between crop
    response to drought and its possible determinants, with implications for several
    SDGs, including Zero Hunger, Climate Action, and Life on Land. The findings highlight
    the importance of understanding the complex interactions between climate, crops,
    and the environment to improve food security, build resilience to climate change,
    and promote sustainable land use achieving the SDGs. 6. Conclusion Targeting global
    sustainable and resilient crop systems is critical to achieving food security.
    This study addresses the gaps in understanding the significant drought time scales
    which influence crop yield sensitivity on a global scale. This study revealed
    several key results associated with the study''s objectives. (1) We found that
    soybean and wheat might respond to more prolonged droughts spanning from medium
    to longer timescales (5–12 months), while rice and maize responded to short-medium
    drought time scales (1–8 months). Crop yield response to drought timescales might
    differ across crops and regions. (2) This study revealed that arid and continental
    regions generally respond to a longer drought timescale. In contrast, temperate
    and tropical regions were mostly influenced by short to medium drought timescales
    (except the dry farming crop, i.e., wheat which is mostly influenced by longer
    drought timescales). (3) Related to the key determinants, we suggest that climate
    (i.e., temperature, water balance) and socioeconomic factors (GDP per capita)
    may be key factors controlling the pattern of crop response to different drought
    timescales. Finally, we provide the first attempt to assess key factors determining
    crop response to different drought timescales globally, which might help mitigate
    crop systems'' vulnerability to climate-related stressors. Therefore, this study
    may bring an additional framework for adaptation and mitigation against future
    climate risks to ensure future global food security under climate warming and
    more severe and frequent extreme climates. Declaration of Competing Interest The

    impactSustainabilityTechnology IntegrationWater quality 1. Introduction Water,
    an irreplaceable resource, lies at the core of sustainable development and the
    well-being of our planet''s ecosystems and inhabitants (Melo et al., 2021; Emenike
    et al., 2022). However, the world is confronting a formidable global water crisis,
    characterized by scarcity, pollution, and inefficient management practices, which
    necessitates a profound transformation in the status quo (Du Plessis and du Plessis,
    2019). The ever-mounting pressure on water resources calls for a paradigm shift
    in our approach to water treatment, conservation, and management (Ohale et al.,
    2023; Emenike et al., 2023). Traditional methods, once deemed adequate, now exhibit
    limitations in providing real-time insights, optimizing resource usage, and mitigating
    the far-reaching environmental impacts. The inadequacy of conventional practices
    in addressing the complexities of water-related issues necessitates the exploration
    of cutting-edge technologies that hold the promise of revolutionizing the way
    man interacts with and preserve this finite resource. ChatGPT, short for \"Chat
    Generative Pre-trained Transformer,\" represents an advanced form of artificial
    intelligence language model. Developed by OpenAI, ChatGPT is a descendant of the
    renowned GPT-3, designed specifically for natural language understanding and generation
    in conversational contexts (Abdullah et al., 2022). It operates on a deep neural
    network architecture, pre-trained on massive amounts of text data from the internet
    (Miao et al., 2023). ChatGPT possesses the remarkable ability to comprehend and
    generate human-like text, making it exceptionally adept at engaging in written
    and spoken conversations. It excels at tasks such as answering questions, generating
    text, providing explanations, and even simulating conversations with users (Dergaa

    modelHotan River Basin 1. Introduction Groundwater is an indispensable water resource
    in arid inland regions (Elmqvist et al., 2003, Shamsudduha, 2013, Nampak et al.,
    2014, Chinnasamy et al., 2018). Not only is groundwater essential for all life,
    but it also performs valuable ecosystem services. The combination of climate change
    and human activities has already overburdened groundwater resources in arid inland
    river basins (Chen et al., 2019, Yang et al., 2019, Ozano et al., 2022). However,
    this essential resource remains at serious risk from declining groundwater levels,
    soil salinization, land desertification, and vegetation degradation, all of which
    degrade vulnerable ecosystems (Zhang et al., 2012). Groundwater security is experiencing
    significant challenges in arid regions where groundwater exploitation and utilization
    are approaching or surpassing its threshold, and concerns about the resilience
    of groundwater systems in arid regions are a primary focus (Hugman et al., 2012,
    Fuchs et al., 2018, Pourmoghim et al., 2022). Since Holling adopted resilience
    into ecosystem stability studies in 1973, resilience has been a research focus
    in the fields of hydrology, ecology and meteorology (Fuchs et al., 2018, Gönnert
    and Gerkensmeier, 2015, Holling, 1973, Thomas and Waring, 2015). Resiliency indicates
    how quickly a water resource system returns to a satisfactory condition after
    an unsatisfactory condition (Hashimoto et al., 1982). Katic and Grafton (2011)
    introduced groundwater resilience as the ability of a groundwater system to recover
    to its original state after an external disturbance and deviation from its equilibrium
    state, following natural and human intervention. The resilience and vulnerability
    of a groundwater system under external disturbance are constantly changing with
    the changes in external stresses and system functions. Many scholars have studied
    water resilience from various perspectives. Hashimoto et al. (1982) first proposed
    the indices of reliability, resiliency and vulnerability (RRV) for classifying
    and evaluating the performance of water resource systems. This approach (RRV)
    has been widely used by researchers because it is rational, efficient, and accessible
    (Fowler et al., 2003, Peters et al., 2005; Mondal and Wasimi, 2007; Rodak et al.,
    2014; Lu et al., 2019; Nair and Indu, 2021). Qi et al. (2016) proposed an indicator
    reflecting the autocorrelation of variables at a given time based on a convex
    model and critical slowing down theory, initially used to identify changes in
    watershed resilience for annual runoff. Liu et al. (2021) studied the resilience
    of the Yangtze River Basin under climatic factors and anthropogenic disturbance
    using this indicator. Herrera-Franco et al. (2020) developed a matrix for evaluating
    the resilience of coastal aquifers based on indicators from sustainable development
    goals (SDGs) within a sociohydrological framework, combining four axes of development
    (political, social, environmental and cultural). Behboudian et al. (2021) proposed
    two criteria based on robustness, redundancy, resourcefulness, rapidity, and durability
    (4R-D) and a social resilience-based criterion (SR) to assess the total resilience
    of water resource systems. According to previous studies, different methods have
    evaluated the resilience of water resource systems. Nevertheless, the quantification
    of groundwater resilience remains a challenge. Previous works have mostly focused
    on selecting single indicators (Hashimoto et al., 1982, Moy et al., 1986, Hugman
    et al., 2012, Qi et al., 2016) or constructing indicator frameworks (Herrera-Franco
    et al., 2020, Behboudian et al., 2021) to assess the resilience of water resource
    systems in changing environments. However, single-factor evaluation methods often
    lead to inconsistent resilience results due to differences in the selection of
    indicators and calculation methods. Although the indicator systematic evaluation
    method accounts for multiple factors, it can obtain only an average level of resilience
    at the local scale, which makes obtaining the spatial distribution characteristic
    of resilience and verifying the reliability of the selection of weights for each
    indicator difficult. Currently, few studies have been conducted to spatially predict
    groundwater resilience. For the effective management and long-term use of groundwater
    resources, an urgency exists to find a spatially scalable calculation method to
    assess groundwater resilience, which requires mapping to the spatial distribution
    of groundwater resilience. The factors influencing the spatial distribution of
    groundwater resilience can be divided into natural and anthropogenic factors.
    Natural factors include the geological and hydrogeological conditions of the aquifer
    (Singh et al., 2011, Garg and Wani, 2013, Mogaji et al., 2015, Rahmati and Melesse,
    2016, Alraggad et al., 2017, Mogaji, 2017). Anthropogenic factors mainly refer
    to various behavioural factors that may cause groundwater decline and pollution
    (Singh et al., 2011, Nampak et al., 2014, Rahmati and Melesse, 2016). The available
    methods widely used for studying the spatial distribution of groundwater include
    the overlay and index method (Ertürk et al., 2017, Kumar et al., 2019), fuzzy
    logic (Naghibi et al., 2015, Rahmati et al., 2015), frequency ratio (FR) (Nampak
    et al., 2014, Razandi et al., 2015), analytic hierarchy process (AHP) (Chowdhury
    et al., 2009, Razandi et al., 2015), and Dempster-Shafer (DS) theory model (Nampak
    et al., 2014, Mogaji et al., 2015, Rahmati and Melesse, 2016). The Dempster-Shafer
    theory model, which supports the integration of information from multiple heterogeneous
    sources and enables the flexible construction of basic probability assignment
    (BPA) between single-factor resilience indicators and spatial data layers of groundwater
    conditioning factors and provides prediction results, systematic errors and random
    errors (Mogaji et al., 2015, Naghibi et al., 2015, Rahmati and Melesse, 2016),
    is a potentially reliable method for predicting the spatial distribution of groundwater
    resilience. The Hotan River Basin is a typical arid inland river basin, with mountains
    as the runoff generation regions and plains as the oasis water-consuming area
    (Guo et al., 2016). The Hotan River runoff is primarily recharged by glacial/snow
    meltwater, and the river is a seasonal river with runoff concentrated in the summer,
    accounting for 75% of annual runoff (Li et al., 2018). With scarce precipitation
    and uneven spatial and temporal distributions of surface water, groundwater plays
    an important role in meeting the growing demand for water for agricultural production
    and domestic use (Shi et al., 2021, Huang et al., 2022). With economic development
    and population growth, the human demand for groundwater resources has further
    intensified (Fu et al., 2018, Shi et al., 2021), and the water levels in groundwater
    wells in the Hotan River Basin have almost universally declined. Therefore, taking
    the Hotan River Basin as a case study, research on groundwater resilience especially
    after extraction, in arid inland river basins is significant for the safety and
    effective management of regional groundwater resources (Grönwall and Oduro-Kwarteng,
    2018; Fuchs et al., 2018). The main purpose of this study is to construct a verifiable
    evaluation method for the spatial distribution of groundwater resilience in the
    Hotan River Basin. (1) The most widely used groundwater performance indicator
    (Nair and Indu, 2021) of the RRV criterion and the resilience indicator (Qi et
    al., 2016) are adopted to calculate groundwater resilience. (2) Quantitative analysis
    of the relationship between groundwater resilience and various conditioning factors
    is performed based on GIS technology combined with the Dempster-Shafer theory
    model. (3) Groundwater resilience zoning maps are generated and validated with
    groundwater resilience data from observation wells to assess the validity of the
    Dempster-Shafer theory model as a criterion for determining spatial groundwater
    resilience zones. The study will provide information on groundwater resilience
    in arid inland river basins and serve as a scientific reference for the integrated
    management of water resources in inland river basins. 2. Study area The study
    area (79°23′–80°38′E, 36°53′–38°7′N; Fig. 1) is part of the Hotan River Basin
    in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in China, located at the southern edge
    of the Taklamakan Desert and the northern slope of the Kunlun Mountains, with
    a total area of 9349.63 km2. The study area has a warm continental arid desert
    climate, with an average annual precipitation of 48. 7 mm, and the average annual
    temperature is 11.9 °C (Fu et al., 2018). The Hotan River comprises two tributaries,
    the eastern branch of the Yurunkash River and the western branch of the Karakash
    River, which originate from the northern slope of the Kunlun Mountains and the
    Karakoram Mountains, respectively. The Yurunkash River has a total length of 504 km
    and a catchment area of 14813 km2 (Shi et al., 2021, Wang et al., 2021). The Karakash
    River has a total length of 808 km and a catchment area of 21532 km2 (Wang et
    al., 2021). The average annual runoff of the Yurunkash River and Karakash River
    is 22. 85 × 108 m3 and 21. 67 × 108 m3 respectively (Shi et al., 2021), which
    converts into runoff depths of 154.3 mm and 100.6 mm. Download : Download high-res

    map of the study area with groundwater wells. (Drawing review No. GS(2020)4619
    and GS(2019)3266). The groundwater recharge, runoff, and discharge in the study
    area are obviously horizontally zoned due to the constraints of climatic and hydrological
    conditions, geological formations, and geomorphology (Shi et al., 2021). The mountainous
    area is the groundwater recharge source area, the premontane diluvial gravel plain
    is the groundwater recharge runoff area, and the alluvial-diluvial fine soil plain
    and the northern desert alluvial layer are groundwater discharge areas (Shi et
    al., 2021). From south to north, the groundwater hydraulic gradient gradually
    declines and the groundwater level rises. The groundwater recharge sources and
    recharge modes in this area are mainly river seepage, channels and field irrigation
    infiltration (Huang et al., 2022). The discharge modes are mainly phreatic water
    evaporation and spring overflow (Huang et al., 2022). The Hotan oasis is an area
    of significant irrigated agriculture and urban and rural residents, whose survival
    and development are dependent on the water of the Hotan River (Fu et al., 2018).
    Agricultural water use is the mainstay of water resource use in the basin, with
    agriculture accounting for 55%− 75% and domestic water use accounting for 0.5%− 3%
    of the total consumption in the basin from 2003 to 2020 (the data are provided
    by the Xinjiang Tarim River Basin Authority). In addition, groundwater is an essential
    source of water supply, with production, domestic use and ecological use accounting
    for 90.6%, 8.6% and 0.8%, respectively, of the total groundwater extraction in
    2010 in Hotan, and agriculture accounted for 62% of the total groundwater extraction
    (Wang et al., 2013). Ensuring the sustainable use of groundwater resources in
    the Hotan River Basin is therefore vital to the sustainable socioeconomic development
    of the Hotan oasis. 3. Materials and methods 3.1. Groundwater resilience index
    Single-factor evaluation methods are applied here to evaluate long-term groundwater
    resilience. The resilience indicates how quickly a system returns to a satisfactory
    state after an unsatisfactory state (Hashimoto et al., 1982). The resilience indicator
    , proposed by Qi et al. (2016), based on the convex model and critical slowing
    down theory, reflects the autocorrelation of variables at a given time and quantifies
    the temporal variation in water resource system resilience (Kumar et al., 2020,
    Liu et al., 2021). We thus use the two indicators above to calculate groundwater
    resilience. 3.1.1. Groundwater performance indicator ( ) The groundwater performance
    indicator from the traditional RRV criteria is used to assess groundwater resilience
    in the study area (Hashimoto et al., 1982, Nair and Indu, 2021). First, a criterion
    (i.e., multiyear average groundwater level) is defined for each groundwater well,
    and represents a time series of groundwater levels. A satisfactory state ) indicates
    that the groundwater level of the well exceeds the annual average, and an unsatisfactory
    state indicates that the groundwater level is lower than the annual average. The
    groundwater performance indicator can be defined in Eq. (1). (1) is used to assess
    the resilience of the wells in the study area, ranging from 0 to 1. This indicator
    reflects the rate of recovery to a satisfactory state after a system failure.
    The larger the value of is, the higher the groundwater resilience. 3.1.2. Resilience
    indicator ( We use groundwater level as a state variable and the resilience indicator
    to quantify the temporal variation in the resilience of the groundwater system.
    Groundwater resilience can be reflected by the deviance between a state variable
    and its adjacent values ( , with the number of neighbouring points being 2 n).
    The larger the deviation is, the higher the groundwater system resilience, indicating
    that the time series corresponding to state variables have a lower autocorrelation.
    The resilience indicator can be computed as shown in (2), (3), (4), (5). (2) (3)
    (4) (5) where γ is the threshold of the deviation of from its adjacent points.
    and denote the maximum and minimum of the monthly groundwater level data series,
    respectively. According to Qi et al. (2016), is used as an empirical value of
    0.75, and the threshold γ is 0.375 (Eq. (4)). The temporal variation of is consistent
    for different . Here, is considered to be 4 (the number of neighbouring points
    is 8). The range of is 0–8. Based on the groundwater level data, we use (2), (3),
    (4), (5) to calculate the groundwater system resilience in the study area at moment
    . 3.1.3. Data source Data for the calculation of the groundwater resilience index
    can be directly retrieved from the monthly groundwater level data of 27 groundwater
    wells monitored by the Hotan Water Resources Bureau from 1989 to 2020. 3.2. Groundwater
    resilience zones Groundwater resilience zonation mapping consists of four primary
    steps. (1) Creating spatial datasets of groundwater conditioning factors as evidential
    layers for the Dempster-Shafer theory model. (2) Establishing mathematical relationships
    between resilience and groundwater conditioning factors and integrating evidence
    based on the Dempster-Shafer theory model. (3) Creating and validating the groundwater
    resilience zonation map. (4) Interpretation and comparison of results. The overall
    methodology is illustrated in Fig. 2. Download : Download high-res image (428KB)

    resilience zonation mapping. 3.2.1. Groundwater resilience conditioning factors
    In addition, a spatial database of different spatial datasets is essential to
    establishing a reliable and accurate groundwater resilience prediction model in
    the study area. The spatial distribution of groundwater is governed by natural
    factors, including meteorology, hydrology, geomorphology and geological formations
    (Singh et al., 2011, Garg and Wani, 2013, Mogaji et al., 2015, Alraggad et al.,
    2017, Mogaji, 2017), and anthropogenic factors such as land use (Singh et al.,
    2011, Nampak et al., 2014, Rahmati and Melesse, 2016, Liu et al., 2021). Through
    the information obtained from the literature, nine groundwater conditioning factors,
    including lithology, geomorphology, slope, soil type, distance to river, canal
    density, hydraulic conductivity, groundwater depth, and land use, are considered
    in this study. These factors affect the groundwater resilience of the area by
    influencing groundwater storage, recharge, transport, and discharge. Raster datasets
    of the nine groundwater conditioning factors are generated in GIS to evaluate
    groundwater resilience in the study area. A brief description of these nine factors
    is provided below. 3.2.1.1. Lithology Lithological differences directly affect
    infiltration, and lithology is one of the indispensable factors for the evaluation
    and prediction of groundwater prospects in the region (Mogaji et al., 2015, Ait
    El Mekki and Laftouhi, 2016). The aquifer in the study area mainly consists of
    alluvial-diluvial aquifers in the gravel plain and alluvial-diluvial aquifers
    in the fine soil plain. The gravel plain alluvial-diluvial aquifer mainly comprises
    sand gravel and fine sand intercalated by sand gravel and gravel-cobble. As the
    slope of the terrain becomes flatter, the sediment grains of the alluvial-diluvial
    aquifer in the fine soil plain become finer, and the lithology of the aquifer
    is finer, with medium to coarse sand and fine sand generally found in the area
    (Shi et al., 2021). The lithology of the study area is divided into four categories,
    from south to north as follows: gravel, sand gravel, fine sand, and meal sand
    (Fig. 3a). Download : Download high-res image (556KB) Download : Download full-size

    to river, (f) canal density, (g) hydraulic conductivity, (h) groundwater depth,
    and (i) land use. Fig. 3 (continued). 3.2.1.2. Geomorphology The topographic map
    of the study area is derived from the dataset of the remote sensing survey of
    resources and the environmental project of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, with
    a resolution of 100 m. The dataset has four geomorphology classes, including beach
    land, plain, mountains and desert (Fig. 3b). 3.2.1.3. Slope The slope determines
    the recharge process of groundwater and is negatively related to the infiltration
    rate of surface water with which groundwater interacts (Nampak et al., 2014, Ait
    El Mekki and Laftouhi, 2016). The slope is calculated from a digital elevation
    model (DEM) in GIS. The slope is classified into five classes using quantile classification,
    0–0.313, 0.313–0.625, 0.625–0.938, 0.938–1.355, and 1.355–26.577, for evaluating
    groundwater resilience in the study area (Fig. 3c). 3.2.1.4. Soil type Soil properties
    are a critical factor controlling groundwater recharge, and soil types and their
    various permeabilities largely control the infiltration or transport rate of surface
    water into aquifer systems (Rahmati and Melesse, 2016). The soil map of the study
    area is extracted from the second national soil census data (a 1:1,000,000 scale
    digital soil map of China). Amorphic soils, semi-aquatic soils, anthrosols, desert
    soils, and alkali-saline soils are distributed throughout the study area (Fig.
    3d). 3.2.1.5. Distance to river and canal density Euclidean distance and line
    density tools are applied to generate river distance and canal density maps in
    the study area, respectively, from the current river and canal data. The distance
    from the river is categorized into five groups: < 2.18, 2.18–5.89, 5.89–12.87,
    12.87–24.20, and > 24.20 km (Fig. 3e). Fig. 3f indicates that the canal density
    is divided into five categories, including 0, 0–0.103, 0.103–0.175, 0.175–0.315,
    and > 0.315 km/km2. A shorter distance to the river and a higher canal density
    imply a higher surface runoff, which favours groundwater storage. 3.2.1.6. Hydraulic
    conductivity Hydraulic conductivity depends on the groundwater flow in the aquifer
    (Mogaji, 2017), and regions with a higher hydraulic conductivity favour groundwater
    enrichment. As shown in Fig. 3g, the spatial distribution of the hydraulic conductivity
    of shallow groundwater in the study area generally decreases from south to north.
    The zoning of hydraulic conductivity in the study area is divided into five classes.
    3.2.1.7. Groundwater depth The groundwater depth dictates the depth of groundwater
    transport and the time of contact with the surrounding medium (Oikonomidis et
    al., 2015). The groundwater depth is separated into six categories: < 1, 1–3,
    3–6, 6–10, 10–20, and > 20 m (Fig. 3h). The groundwater depth map of the study
    area is obtained from 2010 groundwater depth data from the Hotan River Basin.
    3.2.1.8. Land use Land use is a vital factor in controlling groundwater recharge,
    and different land types have different impacts on the groundwater recharge process
    (Kaliraj et al., 2014). The land use data of the study area in 2015 are obtained
    from the results dataset of the remote sensing survey of resources and the environmental
    project of the Chinese Academy of Sciences with a resolution of 30 m. According
    to the land use characteristics of the study area and national land type classification
    standards, land types are reclassified into six categories: farmland, woodland,
    grassland, water body, residential area and unused land (Fig. 3i). 3.2.2. Dempster-Shafer
    evidence theory model In 1967, Dempster first suggested the Dempster-Shafer evidence
    theory as a rule of information combination in his study of statistical questions
    (Dempster, 1967). In further developing this evidence theory, Shafer proposed
    a mathematical approach to uncertainty inference based on \"evidence\" and \"combination\"
    by adopting the concept of a belief function (Shafer, 1976). In the present study,
    the Dempster-Shafer evidence theory model is applied to predict groundwater resilience,
    and it is constructed by establishing a framework of discernment, defining the
    basic probability assignment, calculating the mass function, and implementing
    the evidence combination. A framework of discernment is the set of all probable
    targets for a certain object to be judged and is a mutually exclusive nonempty
    finite set (Eq. (6)). in Eq. 6 is the probability that each pixel is high for
    the target groundwater resilience, and ̅ is the negation of , i.e., the probability
    that each pixel is lower for the groundwater resilience. The basic probability
    assignment is performed for the target in the framework of discernment, and the
    basic probability function (Eq. (7)) needs to fulfil the conditions and . (6)
    ̅ (7) According to the existing groundwater resilience calculation results, we
    consider ≥ 0.094 and ≥ 2 as the criteria for target . The belief function , disbelief

    characterizes the range of the degree of uncertainty (Fig. 4). The size of the
    belief interval determines the extent of credibility of the evidence. The wider
    the interval is, the lower the credibility of the evidence and vice versa. (8)

    among the evidence belief functions. The basic probability assignment of each
    information layer is decided according to the spatial relationship between the
    spatial location of observation wells and the groundwater conditioning factor
    layers. The attributes of the groundwater conditioning factor layers are superimposed
    to obtain raster layers corresponding to the belief, disbelief, plausibility,
    and uncertainty of each groundwater conditioning factor. The basic probability
    assignment of different information layers is combined to obtain the ultimate
    results according to the combination rules of the Dempster-Shafer evidence theory.
    The evidence combination rules used in this study are as follows (Mogaji et al.,
    2015). (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) The degree of belief generated by evidence is
    expressed by , the degree of plausibility is expressed by , the degree of uncertainty
    is expressed by and calculated as , and the degree of disbelief is expressed by
    and calculated as . In (14), (15), (16), (17), (18): denotes the lower degree
    of belief for each layer of factor type or range, denotes the degree of disbelief
    for each layer of factor type or range, denotes the degree of uncertainty for
    each layer of factor type or range, denotes each factor type (1, 2, ..., 9), and
    is called the normalization factor. The mass functions in the Dempster-Shafer
    evidence theory model, including belief, disbelief, uncertainty, and plausibility,
    are the belief function components that evaluate the predictive ability of the
    evidence model. Using (14), (15), (16), (17), (18) to iterate evidential layers,
    eight operational iterations are performed on the nine evidential layers. The
    final results are used to construct a groundwater resilience zonation map for
    the study area. 4. Results and discussion 4.1. Groundwater resilience based on
    the groundwater performance indicator ( ) and resilience indicator ( ) The paper
    quantitatively estimates groundwater resilience based on groundwater level data
    in the study area using two methods: the groundwater performance indicator and
    the resilience indicator . The statistical characteristics are shown in Table

    1989–2020 4.18 1.25 2.82 0.83 0.30 The theoretical value of the groundwater performance
    indicator is 0–1, and ranges from 0 to 0.25 in the study area, with an average
    value of 0.094 and 44% of the wells being greater than the average. According
    to the value, resilience is classified into five classes with values ranging from
    0 to 0.01, 0.01–0.02, 0.02–0.03, 0.03–0.094, and > 0.094. Nineteen percent of
    the wells have low resilience (compared with moderate resilience), and 44% of
    the wells have high resilience. The average of 27 wells is used to assess the
    interannual variation in groundwater resilience in the study area. The observation
    wells are located in areas with a relatively high resilience, while the wells
    with a relatively low resilience are mainly located in areas with a high groundwater
    depth and are far from the river. Wells with a relatively high resilience are
    mainly found in the upstream oasis irrigation area and near the downstream river
    channel, where the lithology is coarse (sand gravel and fine sand), the terrain
    is flat and canal systems are densely distributed, and the soil types are mainly
    semi-aquatic soils and anthrosols (Fig. 5). Download : Download high-res image

    is higher than in the very low and moderate high classes. Which more representative
    in assessing regional groundwater resilience: the groundwater performance indicator
    or the resilience indicator ? The advantage of the water resource systems resilience
    metric proposed by Hashimoto et al. (1982) is that it can describe the rate at
    which the system recovers to a satisfactory state after a failure, but the satisfactory
    or unsatisfactory state depends on a set threshold. Here, we set the multiyear
    average groundwater level of each well as the threshold. The resilience indicator
    , based on a convex model and critical slowing down theory, can not only reveal
    the temporal variability of groundwater system resilience but also effectively
    identify critical shifts in groundwater system resilience (Qi et al., 2016, Kumar
    et al., 2020). Both approaches to assessing resilience can address long-term changes
    in system resilience, but the resilience metric better meets the five criteria
    (baseline functionality, threshold functionality, whole system damage, elapsed
    time to satisfactory recovery, and uncertainty scenarios of disruptions) included
    in the resilience assessment of water resource systems than does the resilience
    indicator (Shin et al., 2018). Notably, for four wells has a value of 0 but is
    not 0. The reason for this is that the calculation of is constrained by the threshold
    limit. If the observation wells are subject to external disturbance and the groundwater
    level is below the multiyear average groundwater level for a long time and cannot
    return to its original state, the water level is still stable within a fixed range.
    In this case, a calculated of 0 does not mean that the groundwater resilience
    at that location is low, and quantifying the groundwater resilience based on the
    is not reliable at this point. In contrast, the resilience indicator better reflects
    variations in long-term groundwater system resilience, as it is not limited by
    other conditions. Using the resilience indicator to assess groundwater resilience
    and exploring the effects of various resolutions (daily/monthly/annual) or different
    types of hydrological series as state variables on groundwater resilience under
    climate change and anthropogenic disturbance scenarios remains a challenge in
    quantifying groundwater resilience and requires further research in the future.

    Lithology is a critical factor controlling groundwater occurrence (Rahmati and
    Melesse, 2016), and different lithological units affect the groundwater storage
    capacity. The results of the belief calculations show that the value of fine sand
    and sand gravel in the study area is higher than that of other lithological units,
    indicating a positive correlation between this category and groundwater resilience.
    In terms of geomorphology, the highest values are found on the plain, with showing
    low and high values and showing high and low values. is relatively high at the
    lower slope and closer to the river (2.18–5.89 km). Previous studies have illustrated
    that areas with flatter slopes have slower surface runoff, comparatively higher
    infiltration and higher groundwater potential (Nampak et al., 2014, Mogaji et
    al., 2015, Rahmati and Melesse, 2016). For soil types, the highest values occur
    in anthrosols and semi-aquatic soils, indicating the highest groundwater resilience,
    while the relationship between desert soils, amorphic soils and alkali-saline
    soils and groundwater resilience is weak. For canal density, the results for and
    are the reverse, with the former showing high groundwater resilience in low density
    zones (0–0.103 km/km2) and the latter showing an overall increasing trend in Bel
    as the canal density increases, with the highest at canal densities > 0.709 km/km2.
    According to the findings of Nampak et al. (2014), Rahmati and Melesse (2016),
    and Shi et al. (2021), a positive correlation exists between dense river/drainage
    systems and groundwater occurrence; therefore, we believe that estimating the
    belief function for each category of canal density based on is more reliable.
    The hydraulic conductivity is defined as the rate of water flow per unit cross-sectional
    area of an aquifer (Mogaji, 2017). Reducing hydraulic conductivity is important
    for improving resilience (Alraggad et al., 2017). The highest value in the study
    area is at k = 20 m/d; when k < 20 m/d, groundwater resilience tends to increase
    with increasing k values, and the value is 0 when k > 80 m/d due to the absence
    of groundwater well distribution in the area. Regarding the groundwater depth,
    the of shows an overall increasing trend with increasing groundwater depth, and
    the Bel of is highest at 10–20 m, illustrating the high probability of groundwater
    resilience occurring. In the case of land use, the calculation indicates that
    the Bel of residential areas is significantly higher than that of other land use
    types, probably because groundwater wells are mostly located in residential areas.
    shows that the Bel value of woodlands is the highest, followed by residential
    areas, indicating that the groundwater resilience is highest in woodlands. The
    reason for this is that the presence of woodlands decreases groundwater runoff
    and soil evaporation, while the presence of impermeable layers in residential
    areas is not conducive to groundwater recharge. The combined belief function components
    ( , , , and ) are integrated, and the integration results of the nine evidential
    layers are presented in Fig. 7, Fig. 8. The spatial distribution of values explain
    the combination of groundwater resilience with nine conditioning factor evidential
    layers (Fig. 7a, Fig. 8a). Mogaji et al. (2015) concluded that a correlation exists
    between areas with a high degree of , a low degree of , a high degree of , and
    a low degree of . In contrast to the spatial distribution of values, values are
    always low in areas with high , and the belief that areas with low values indicate
    a high groundwater resilience is reliable. Areas with high values are also characterized
    by relatively high and values. The belief function maps of the two indicators
    (Fig. 7a, Fig. 8a) reveal that the areas with the highest groundwater resilience
    in the study area are located mainly in the river channel and the oasis irrigation
    area in the southern part of the study area where the canal system is denser,
    the terrain is flatter and the lithological units are mostly fine sand and gravelly
    sand; meanwhile, the areas with relatively low groundwater resilience are concentrated
    around the oasis irrigation area and in the middle area from the river channel
    to the desert. The values in the study area range from < 10% (Fig. 7c) to < 11.8%
    (Fig. 8c). The value in the -based Dempster-Shafer theory model fusion is generally
    higher than , with Fig. 7c demonstrating that the areas of low values are mostly
    located in the oasis irrigation area. Fig. 8c illustrates that the areas with
    the highest values are mainly situated in mountains, with higher values outside
    the oasis irrigation area and around the downstream river due to insufficient
    observation well data in these areas available for validation. Download : Download

    plausibility. 4.3. Validation of the groundwater resilience map The belief maps
    (Figs. 7a, 8a) are overlaid with the locations of 27 wells in GIS, and the predicted
    values for each point are obtained. (0–0.25) and (1.25–4.18) for the 27 wells
    are then classified as very low, low, moderate, moderate high and high and compared
    with the predicted values for that point. The Dempster-Shafer theory model results
    for and using nine groundwater conditioning factor evidential layers are 40.7%
    and 59.3% accurate, respectively, and the model is subsequently rerun by removing
    nonsignificant factors from the model. For this purpose, we consider excluding
    lithology (Fig. 3a) or hydraulic conductivity (Fig. 3g) from evidential layers
    because they are relatively coarse and unvalidated data with low reliability.
    The results from the final model after removing those factors from the evidential
    layer (Table 3) show that the values are consistent with the predicted values
    for 14 wells, with a prediction accuracy of 51.9%, and the values are consistent
    with those predicted for 18 wells, with a prediction accuracy of 66.7%. The selection
    of the groundwater conditioning factor (the evidential layer transformed in the
    Dempster-Shafer theory model) has a significant impact on the performance of the
    Dempster-Shafer theory model, a conclusion that is consistent with previous studies
    (Nampak et al., 2014, Mogaji et al., 2015). The prediction accuracy of the -based
    Dempster-Shafer model increases by 7.4% after removing the lithology factor and
    by 11.2% after the removal of lithology and hydraulic conductivity factors. In
    general, the Dempster-Shafer theory model constructed using as an indicator for
    evaluating groundwater resilience is superior to that using . Table 3. Validation

    map The groundwater resilience zonation map (Fig. 9) of the final output of the
    values show different levels of groundwater resilience within the study area,
    representing the degree to which the evidential layers support groundwater resilience,
    and is considered the most likely map for predicting groundwater resilience (Mogaji
    et al., 2015). The percentage of each category in the study area is shown in Fig.
    10. Fig. 9a shows the spatial relationship between seven evidential layers (excluding
    lithology and hydraulic conductivity) and . The values are classified as very
    low (0–0.168), low (0.168–0.260), moderate (0.260–0.405), moderate high (0.405–0.632),
    and high (>0.632), accounting for 25%, 15%, 21%, 22% and 17% of the total area,
    respectively. Fig. 9b explains the spatial relationship between eight evidential
    layers (with lithology removed) and , with Bel values divided into five categories:
    very low (Bel value of 0–0.072, 3% of the total area), low (0.072–0.171, 30%),
    medium (0.171–0.458, 30%), high (0.458–0.786, 22%), and high (>0.786, 15%). Prediction
    maps based on the two resilience indicators show that the regions with moderate
    high and high resilience have a good coherence and are mostly distributed in the
    upstream oasis irrigation area and around the downstream river channel, but differences
    exist in the prediction results. The -based prediction map (Fig. 9a) indicates
    high resilience in the southern mountains of the study area and overall low resilience
    around the downstream channel, with large continuous zones of very low resilience.
    In contrast, the prediction map based on (Fig. 9b) displays a discontinuous strip
    of resilience around the downstream channel that transitions from higher areas
    to moderate, then alternating from very low to low, due to the different classification
    of the two indicators and the difference in the resilience categories corresponding
    to the observation wells (see 4.1., Fig. 5). Download : Download high-res image

    theory model based on the groundwater performance indicator and the resilience
    indicator to spatially predict groundwater resilience in the study area and evaluate
    the validity of these two indicators in predicting groundwater resilience. Nine
    groundwater conditioning factors are selected and spatial datasets are created
    as evidential layers in the Dempster-Shafer theory model. The integration results
    are combined to spatially predict the groundwater resilience in the study area,
    ultimately outputting groundwater resilience zoning map. As quantitative criteria
    for groundwater resilience, both and can address long-term changes in the resilience
    of groundwater systems. Wells with relatively high resilience are mainly located
    in the upstream oasis irrigation area and near the downstream river, while wells
    with relatively low resilience are distributed in areas with higher groundwater
    depths and greater distances from the river. The Dempster-Shafer theory model
    is constructed based on resilience indicators and evidential layers consisting
    of groundwater conditioning factors to produce zonal maps of very low, low, moderate,
    moderate high and high groundwater resilience. The accuracy of the prediction
    maps produced by the final model is 51.9% ( ) and 66.7% ( ). Validation of the
    predicted results with yields better results than validation with . According
    to the spatial relationship between eight groundwater conditioning factors (geomorphology,
    slope, distance to river, soil type, canal density, hydraulic conductivity, groundwater
    depth, and land use) and , groundwater resilience is classified as very low (Bel
    value of 0–0.072), low (0.072–0.171), moderate (0.171–0.458), moderate high (0.458–0.786),
    and high (>0.786), accounting for 3%, 30%, 30%, 22%, and 15% of the total area
    of the region, respectively. In conclusion, regional groundwater resilience predictions
    based on the Dempster-Shafer theory model are reasonably reliable, and the model
    has the advantage of not only outputting the degree of support for the prediction
    results from the evidential layers through belief functions but also quantifying
    the uncertainty to reflect systematic and random errors. In addition, the selection
    of groundwater conditioning factors has a significant impact on the performance
    of the Dempster-Shafer theory model, which may produce more accurate and reliable
    spatial prediction results when the evidential layers are sufficiently detailed.
    This study may provide a scientific basis for groundwater resource planning and
    management in the Hotan River Basin, and the findings will assist in understanding
    groundwater resilience in arid inland river basins. CRediT authorship contribution

  limitations: A possible limitation of the study is that the selection of groundwater
    conditioning factors could influence the prediction accuracy of the Dempster-Shafer
    theory model. The study considers nine groundwater conditioning factors, but there
    may be other relevant factors that could be included to improve the model's performance.
  main_objective: To predict the spatial distribution of groundwater resilience and
    assess the resilience of groundwater systems in an arid inland river basin.
  relevance_evaluation: This paper is relevant to my work because it presents a systematic
    methodology to quantify and map groundwater resilience in an arid inland river
    basin using the Dempster-Shafer theory model. The study area, the Hotan River
    Basin, shares similar arid climate, hydrological, and geological conditions with
    the region I am working on, making the findings and methods in this research highly
    relevant and applicable to my own study.

  description: Water management is crucial for agriculture, as it is the primary source
    of irrigation for crops. Effective water management can help farmers to improve
    crop yields, reduce water waste, and increase resilience to drought. This can
    include practices such as precision irrigation, using sensors and technology to
    deliver water only where and when it is needed, and conservation tillage, which
    helps to reduce evaporation and retain moisture in the soil. Additionally, farmers
    can implement water-saving techniques such as crop selection, crop rotation, and
    soil conservation to reduce their water use. Thus, studies aimed at saving the
    use of water in the irrigation process have increased over the years. This research
    suggests using advanced technologies such as IoT and AI to manage irrigation in
    a way that maximizes crop yield while minimizing water consumption, in line with
    Agriculture 4.0 principles. Using sensors in controlled environments, data on
    plant growth was quickly collected. Thanks to the analysis and training of these
    data between several models among them, we find the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN),
    Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes (NB), the KNN has shown interesting
    results with 98.4 accuracy rate and 0.016 root mean squared error (RMSE).

  description: Drought and intensive land use can interact as stressors on riparian
    vegetation, especially along rivers flowing through seasonally dry landscapes.
    Knowledge of past riparian vegetation response to drought and land use change
    can provide land managers with a better understanding of changes induced by upstream
    management actions, climate change, and chronic stressors. To investigate the
    response of riparian vegetation productivity to drought and land use, we developed
    a 21-year time series (2000–2020) of growing season vegetation dynamics using
    near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRV) derived from satellite data across
    30 watershed subbasins that drain into the San Francisco Bay Delta in central
    California, USA. We observed a strong response of riparian vegetation to drought,
    but rapid recovery and very few long-term declines in productivity. At a local
    level, vegetation communities' response to drought and post-drought productivity
    dynamics were highly variable across biophysical settings and land use gradients.
    Most of the riparian areas with long-term declines in NIRV were located in the
    lower elevation Coast Range on the western side of the study area where there
    is little to no water engineering or agricultural irrigation runoff to subsidize
    riparian vegetation. Riparian areas with the greatest long-term increase were
    along rivers draining the higher elevation Sierra Nevada range to the east. Our
    results suggest that river systems with a high proportion of water originating
    as snowmelt may be more buffered against long-term drought-driven declines in
    productivity than those dependent exclusively on winter rainfall. The long-term
    increase in NIRV in the vast majority of riparian areas within our study area
    may also have been driven in part by increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations,
    which have been shown to increase plant water use efficiency.

    SECTIONS PDF TOOLS SHARE Abstract Drought and intensive land use can interact
    as stressors on riparian vegetation, especially along rivers flowing through seasonally
    dry landscapes. Knowledge of past riparian vegetation response to drought and
    land use change can provide land managers with a better understanding of changes
    induced by upstream management actions, climate change, and chronic stressors.
    To investigate the response of riparian vegetation productivity to drought and
    land use, we developed a 21-year time series (2000–2020) of growing season vegetation
    dynamics using near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRV) derived from satellite
    data across 30 watershed subbasins that drain into the San Francisco Bay Delta
    in central California, USA. We observed a strong response of riparian vegetation
    to drought, but rapid recovery and very few long-term declines in productivity.
    At a local level, vegetation communities'' response to drought and post-drought
    productivity dynamics were highly variable across biophysical settings and land
    use gradients. Most of the riparian areas with long-term declines in NIRV were
    located in the lower elevation Coast Range on the western side of the study area
    where there is little to no water engineering or agricultural irrigation runoff
    to subsidize riparian vegetation. Riparian areas with the greatest long-term increase
    were along rivers draining the higher elevation Sierra Nevada range to the east.
    Our results suggest that river systems with a high proportion of water originating
    as snowmelt may be more buffered against long-term drought-driven declines in
    productivity than those dependent exclusively on winter rainfall. The long-term
    increase in NIRV in the vast majority of riparian areas within our study area
    may also have been driven in part by increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations,
    which have been shown to increase plant water use efficiency. INTRODUCTION The
    frequency and intensity of hot droughts in the western United States is increasing
    due to climate warming, which can negatively impact river hydrology and riparian
    ecosystems (Perry et al., 2012; Schook et al., 2022; Williams et al., 2022). Low
    precipitation during droughts reduces plant productivity, with hot droughts adding
    an additional stressor in the form of higher vapor pressure deficit (VPD) that
    amplifies plant stress and exacerbates declines in gross primary productivity
    (GPP) (Dannenberg et al., 2022). For riparian ecosystems, hydrological impacts
    of drought including reductions in baseflows, groundwater levels, surface water
    permanence, and flood magnitudes, as well as advances in the timing of spring
    snowmelt and floods, can also reduce growing season productivity, an impact that
    may be intensified by climate-driven changes in human water demand and associated
    water management (Garssen et al., 2014; Perry et al., 2012; Rohde et al., 2021).
    The confluence of climatic and hydrological consequences of increasingly frequent
    and intense droughts can not only reduce the productivity of riparian vegetation
    but can also lead to more long-lasting impacts in the form of widespread mortality
    of mature plants and reduced seedling survival (Garssen et al., 2014; Kibler et
    al., 2021; Stella & Bendix, 2019). In addition to the direct negative impact of
    extended hot droughts on riparian vegetation, there are several other anthropogenic
    stressors that can exacerbate these impacts. Riparian vegetation is adapted to
    short-term natural disturbances from droughts, floods, and fire, but human-induced
    pressures such as land use conversion, habitat degradation, invasive species,
    water diversion, and modified flood and fire regimes can interact with and modify
    natural disturbances to alter the composition, structure, and function of riparian
    ecosystems (Cooper et al., 2013; Stella et al., 2013). Because the impact of extended
    drought on riparian vegetation cannot be assessed in isolation, it is essential
    to incorporate these additional anthropogenic stressors into any analysis of the
    long-term impact of drought on riparian plant productivity at regional spatial
    scales. California experienced the most severe drought in its recorded history
    during the years 2012–2016, characterized by record high temperatures and precipitation
    deficits (Swain et al., 2014; Ullrich et al., 2018; Williams et al., 2015). This
    extreme drought has had a profound impact on vegetation, leading to the mortality
    of more than 100 million trees in the Sierra Nevada (Fettig et al., 2019) and
    tree cover declines in oak woodlands at lower elevations (Dwomoh et al., 2021).
    Yet, these drought impacts on vegetation were not uniform across the state. Declines
    in normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), a measure of plant “greenness,”
    were far more severe in southern California from 2012 to 2016, with vegetation
    in the northern part of California less severely affected (Dong et al., 2019).
    Riparian vegetation in southern California was particularly impacted, including
    increased mortality of woody riparian plants (Kibler et al., 2021) during the
    years 2012–2016. However, there have been few analyses examining drought impacts
    on riparian vegetation in the central and northern part of California and even
    fewer that incorporate the potentially synergistic effects of human alterations
    to land use and flow regimes. Here, we investigate the response of riparian vegetation
    productivity to drought and land use from 2000 to 2020 in the greater San Francisco
    Bay Delta watershed in central and northern California. This area includes the
    largest estuary on the west coasts of the Americas and the world''s only inland
    delta. Riparian areas within the San Francisco Bay Delta watershed have been heavily
    altered by humans, including the constructions of hundreds of reservoir operations,
    diversions, and canals that make up one of the largest and most complex water
    management systems in the world (Dettinger et al., 2016). We selected a 21-year
    timeframe from 2000 to 2020 to distinguish between drought and nondrought year
    riparian vegetation response. Our goal was to determine the climatic, human, and
    environmental factors affecting productivity responses of different riparian vegetation
    types over time. To address this goal, we used Landsat data to develop a 21-year
    growing season time series of near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRV) and
    then used machine learning models to assess the impact of climate, land use change,
    flow regime, and ecosystem structure on plant productivity dynamics for five major
    riparian vegetation community types. METHODS Study area The greater San Francisco
    Bay Delta watershed covers approximately 200,000 km2 in central and northern California,
    United States (Figure 1), with a Mediterranean climate characterized by cool,
    wet winters and warm, dry summers. Bounded by the Sierra Nevada mountains to the
    east and the northern California Coast Range to the west, nearly half of all surface
    water in California begins as winter rain or snowfall within the Bay Delta watershed
    that is captured and diverted as it flows downstream to the Pacific Ocean. Our
    study focused on riparian vegetation within 30 river drainage subbasins, each
    represented by a unique U.S. Geological Survey Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC8), that
    make up the greater San Francisco Bay Delta watershed (Figure 1; Appendix S1:
    Table S1). FIGURE 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint The greater San Francisco
    Bay Delta watershed, California, USA (in green), with major streams in blue. Riparian
    vegetation classification We delineated riparian vegetation within our study area
    using a 2011 map developed for the California Department of Water Resource''s
    Central Valley Flood Protection Program (Appendix S1: Table S2). Riparian vegetation
    polygons in this 2011 map were hand-digitized from National Agricultural Inventory
    Program aerial imagery at a minimum mapping unit of 0.405 ha and a mean polygon
    width greater than 10 m. We selected riparian vegetation polygons that corresponded
    to five National Vegetation Classification Standards (NVCS) Group levels: Californian
    broadleaf forest and woodland, Southwestern North American riparian evergreen
    and deciduous woodland, Southwestern North American introduced riparian scrub,
    Naturalized warm-temperate riparian and wetland group, and Introduced North American
    Mediterranean woodland and forest (Appendix S1: Table S2). These groups encompass
    the vast majority of riparian vegetation within the study area. We removed polygons
    that, due to their size or location, may have confounded remote sensing analysis
    based on 30-m Landsat data. Polygons associated with man-made features (e.g.,
    canals, dams, agricultural waters) that were either too small or unnaturally linear
    and slim to contain a full 30-m Landsat pixel were filtered out using a size threshold
    >1 ha and a perimeter to area ratio cutoff ≥0.073. We also filtered polygons that
    were <5 m from agriculture classes in the 2001 National Land Cover Database (Appendix
    S1: Table S1), as well as polygons that were >1.2 km from rivers and intermittent
    streams based on the USGS National Hydrography Dataset (Appendix S1: Table S1).
    The final number of polygons used for analysis was 6418, totaling ~740 km2 of
    riparian vegetation (Appendix S1: Table S2). Remote sensing data Landsat satellite
    data have been used to monitor changes in riparian vegetation composition and
    productivity across a wide range of regions and timespans (Cornejo-Denman et al.,
    2020; Nguyen et al., 2015; Villarreal, Van Leeuwen, et al., 2012). The continuity
    of Landsat satellites allows for the generation of vegetation index time series
    that can be analyzed with concurrent climate time series to assess vegetation
    sensitivity to drought and other climatic drivers (Albano et al., 2020; Zhang
    et al., 2021). Cloud-masked Landsat data were processed from 2000 to 2020 in Google
    Earth Engine (Gorelick et al., 2017) to generate a 21-year growing season (June,
    July, and August) time series combining data from Landsat 5 (2000–2011), Landsat
    7 (2012), and Landsat 8 (2013–2020). Individual Landsat 8 surface reflectance
    bands were calibrated to Landsat 5 and 7 using linear equations from Roy et al.
    (2016). We computed the NIRV (Badgley et al., 2017, 2019): where NDVI is the normalized
    difference vegetation index and NIR is the total near-infrared reflectance. NIRV
    has been demonstrated to be an improvement over NDVI for vegetation with dense
    and complex canopy structure and is strongly correlated with GPP even during acute
    drought events (Badgley et al., 2017, 2019), making it well suited for time series
    investigations of drought impacts on riparian vegetation productivity. To arrive
    at a single growing season NIRV for each polygon, we first developed a composite
    of maximum NIRV pixel values during each growing season. We then calculated the
    average of the growing season maximum NIRV per pixel value for each riparian polygon.
    Data analysis We analyzed growing season time series trends in NIRV by riparian
    vegetation type at the polygon level using the Theil–Sen estimator, a robust nonparametric
    method of trend analysis that fits a line to data points by calculating the median
    of the slopes of all lines through pairs of points (Sen, 1968). Sen''s slope is
    insensitive to outliers and does not require the data to conform to a particular
    distribution. We calculated Sen''s slope as the median value for all pairs of
    slopes in the NIRV time series for each polygon at a 95% confidence level using
    the “robslopes” R package (Raymaekers, 2023). We plotted the distribution of polygon-level
    Sen''s slope values for each vegetation community type using density plots to
    compare trends. We further analyzed river reach-level patterns of trends by calculating
    the median Sen''s slope values for all riparian vegetation types within 473 individual
    hexagonal polygons of uniform area (40 km2) along each river corridor. We constructed
    two separate random forest machine learning models to examine the impact of both
    annual climate variability and long-term climate and land cover trends on vegetation
    productivity. Random forests is a supervised ensemble machine learning algorithm
    that combines output from multiple decision trees (Breiman, 2001). The first random
    forest model was constructed to examine whether interannual variation in riparian
    vegetation NIRV over time was driven by climate variability. The response variable
    was the annual growing season NIRV anomaly for each riparian vegetation type,
    calculated as the difference between the annual polygon-level NIRV and the mean
    NIRV for that polygon across the time series (2000–2020). Predictor variables
    were climate and drought indices hypothesized to explain year-to-year variation
    in riparian vegetation productivity (Appendix S1: Table S3). We trained a second
    random forest machine learning model to assess the impacts of local and regional
    land use, normalized long-term climate, and hydrogeographic drivers of long-term
    trends in riparian vegetation productivity. For this second model, we used the
    Sen''s slope value of NIRV trends from 2000 to 2020 as the response variable and
    mean elevation, river hydrology, local land use change, wildland fire (Bendix
    & Commons, 2017), land management, and long-term climate averages as predictor
    variables (Appendix S1: Table S3). Both of the random forest models were implemented
    using the “ranger” R package (Wright & Ziegler, 2017) using 10-fold cross validation
    and parameter tuning to select optimal values for “mtry,” node size, and number
    of trees. The mtry value represents the number of predictor variables randomly
    sampled as candidates at each split in a decision tree, and the minimum node size
    is a stopping criterion beyond which a decision tree is no longer split. The annual
    variability random forest model was parameterized with an optimal mtry value = 8,
    a minimum node size = 5, and the number of trees = 500. The long-term climate
    and land use trend random forest model was parameterized with an mtry value = 5,
    a minimum node size = 3, and the number of trees = 500. All statistical analyses
    were performed using the R statistical computing language (R Core Team, 2022).
    RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Although NIRV of each vegetation type assessed in this
    study declined in response to drought periods from 2007 to 2008 and 2012 to 2016
    (Figure 2a), all five riparian vegetation types had annual NIRV values that were
    equal to or above the long-term 21-year average from 2016 to 2020 (Figure 2b).
    Kernel density plots of polygon-level Sen''s slope value distributions revealed
    the majority of polygons within each vegetation type had a positive Sen''s slope
    value (Figure 3), indicating NIRV for most areas within each vegetation type generally
    increased over the 21-year time period from 2000 to 2020. The rapid increase in
    greenness and productivity after prolonged drought periods, as well as the overall
    positive trends in NIRV across riparian vegetation types, stands in stark contrast
    to the waves of mortality in both riparian vegetation (Kibler et al., 2021) and
    upland vegetation (Dwomoh et al., 2021; Fettig et al., 2019) in other parts of
    California following the 2012–2016 drought. In upland areas of the central and
    southern Sierra Nevada, nearly 70% of overall tree mortality occurred in 2016
    and 2017 despite increased precipitation in those years (Fettig et al., 2019).
    The fact that NIRV of riparian vegetation in our study area increased sharply
    in 2016 and 2017 suggests that riparian areas in the Bay Delta experienced more
    immediate replenishment of soil moisture, possibly because of increased streamflow.
    The slower replenishment of soil moisture in upland areas of the Sierra Nevada
    combined with continued bark beetle irruptions may have exhausted trees'' reserves
    of nonstructural carbohydrates, leading to continued mortality in 2016 and 2017
    despite increased precipitation in those years (Erbilgin et al., 2021). The discrepancy
    in drought resilience between our study area and more severely impacted areas
    in southern California may also be due in part to the spatial variation of drought
    severity in California from 2012 to 2016 and to a more long-term trend of exacerbated
    aridity in the southernmost part of California extending back to the last century
    (Wise, 2010). Drought severity and drought sensitivity of vegetation was much
    greater in southern California from 2000 to 2018, while areas in northern California
    including our study area were less affected (Dong et al., 2019). Another exacerbating
    factor may have been the higher proportion of intermittent streams in the more
    arid southern part of the state, leading to more rapid and more extreme depletion
    of groundwater under prolonged drought (Kibler et al., 2021). FIGURE 2 Open in

    (b) for each of five riparian vegetation types in the greater San Francisco Bay

    slope kernel density plots of growing season near-infrared reflectance of vegetation
    from 2000 to 2020 for each of five riparian vegetation types in the greater San
    Francisco Bay Delta watershed, California, USA. The overall increasing trend of
    riparian vegetation NIRV from 2000 to 2020 held along riparian corridors throughout
    the San Francisco Bay Delta. Median Sen''s slope values for riparian vegetation
    were positive within 404 of the 473 riparian hexagonal polygons (Figure 4). There
    were six riparian corridors that showed major declines in NIRV over time as indicated
    by negative median Sen''s slop values: three in the southern Sierra Nevada range
    (Tuolomne River, South Fork of the Fresno River, and portions of the San Joaquin
    River) and three within the Coast Range (Stony Creek, Cache Creek, and Coyote
    Creek; Figure 4). Overall, however, the most negative Sen''s slope values were
    from riparian corridors flowing from the coast range into the Central Valley (Figure
    4). In contrast, stretches of the San Joaquin River flowing out of the Sierra
    Nevada had among the highest positive median Sen''s slope values for riparian
    vegetation across the entire Bay Delta watershed (Figure 4). This pattern suggests
    that river systems with a high proportion of water originating as snowmelt, such
    as those draining the high elevation Sierra Nevada, may be more buffered against
    long-term drought-driven declines in productivity compared with lower elevation
    river systems dependent exclusively on winter rainfall. Native riparian evergreen
    and deciduous woodland, which is more common to streams draining the Sierra Nevada,
    tended to have the highest productivity over time based on NIRV values, while
    lower elevation Introduced Mediterranean woodland was consistently the least productive
    (Figure 2a). FIGURE 4 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Median Sen''s slope of
    annual growing season near-infrared reflectance of vegetation from 2000 to 2020
    for riparian vegetation within each of 473 uniform hexagonal polygons (40 km2)
    along river reaches in the greater San Francisco Bay Delta watershed, California,
    USA. Drought was a major driver of year-to-year variation in productivity for
    each riparian vegetation type, with indices of climatic variability explaining
    up to 46% of the interannual anomaly (Table 1). Only Introduced Mediterranean
    woodland, which covers only 1 km2 of the entire study area, had <30% of variation
    in NIRV anomaly explained by the climate response variables. The Palmer drought
    severity index (PDSI) was always one of the top three predictors of NIRV anomaly
    for each vegetation type, as was the standardized evapotranspiration-precipitation
    index (SPEI), albeit at different time scales depending on the vegetation type
    (Table 1). Mean elevation was also among the top three predictors of NIRV inter-annual
    variability for both native riparian evergreen and deciduous woodland, the most
    productive vegetation type over time, and for Introduced Mediterranean woodland,
    which was the least productive over the 21-year time period (Figure 2a). This
    result also supports the conclusion that higher elevation, snowmelt-driven rivers
    may be more buffered against long-term drought than lower elevation rivers dependent
    on winter rainfall and controlled reservoir releases while also experiencing higher
    growing season temperatures. TABLE 1. Proportion of inter-annual variation in

    examining long-term trends in riparian vegetation productivity explained only
    9%–27% of the variation in Sen''s slope of NIRV, depending on vegetation type
    (Table 2). Aside from mean elevation, there was little agreement in the top three
    predictors of the 21-year trend in NIRV across the five riparian vegetation types.
    This result suggests there were one or more significant driving variables that
    were not included in our model. One such variable might be atmospheric CO2 concentration,
    which has increased by 12% (44.6 ppm) from 2000 to 2020 during the northern hemisphere
    growing season (June, July, and August). Recent research indicates that the CO2
    fertilization effect is responsible for nearly half of the increase in plant productivity
    across a network of eddy covariance towers since the early 2000s (Chen et al.,
    2022). TABLE 2. Proportion of variation in 21-year trends in riparian vegetation

    See Appendix S1: Table S5 for importance values of each predictor variable by

    may be related to the impact of adjacent land use and land use change (Cooper
    et al., 2013; Stella et al., 2013). Although we attempted to account for this
    in the model with the inclusion of changes in local water use through flow accumulation
    and proxies of agricultural and urban land cover changes, there are likely more
    nuanced anthropogenic factors influencing vegetation dynamics at both the patch
    and reach scale. These difficult-to-capture anthropogenic factors include flood
    control efforts (Webb et al., 2007), the impact of watershed-wide impervious surfaces
    on runoff and flooding (White & Greer, 2006), wastewater and agricultural water
    subsidies (Rohde et al., 2021; Villarreal, Drake, et al., 2012), changes in livestock
    stocking rates and exclosures (Nussle et al., 2017; Sarr, 2002), and the result
    of maturing stream restoration efforts (Lennox et al., 2011). Despite growing
    residential and agricultural demands on water in California, the impacts of many
    local land changes like those listed above may result in overall net positive
    impact on riparian growth. Riparian vegetation within the San Francisco Bay Delta
    appears resilient to drought-induced declines in productivity, in part because
    drought intensity and drought sensitivity of riparian vegetation was less extreme
    during the 2000–2020 time period when compared with areas in southern California
    (Dong et al., 2019). Analysis of riparian greenness trends across the state of
    Nevada reported similar findings, noting positive trends in mountainous regions
    and negative trends in the valley bottoms associated with agriculture and water
    management (Albano et al., 2020). However, the land use variables we analyzed
    had no discernible impact on long-term trends of riparian vegetation greenness
    in our study area, suggesting that other factors like the CO2 fertilization effect
    and engineered water delivery systems might have contributed to the overall positive
    long-term trend in NIRV across riparian vegetation types within the greater San
    Francisco Bay Delta watershed. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Funding for this work was provided

  key_findings: Riparian vegetation in the study area exhibited a strong response
    to drought, but a rapid recovery and very few long-term declines in productivity.
    Riparian vegetation in the study area appears resilient to drought-induced declines
    in productivity, likely due to less extreme drought intensity and sensitivity
    compared to other regions. Overall, there was a positive trend in riparian vegetation
    productivity in the study area from 2000 to 2020.
  limitations: Limited to the San Francisco Bay Delta watershed in central and northern
    California, USA. Excludes other regions with different climate and land use patterns.
    Does not include socio-economic factors or human interventions that may influence
    riparian vegetation productivity.
  main_objective: To investigate the response of riparian vegetation productivity
    to drought and land use in the greater San Francisco Bay Delta watershed in central
    and northern California from 2000 to 2020.

  description: 'Climate change and the increasing frequency of climate extremes associated
    with warming have been the most important climatic stressors for maize production.
    However, crop-model based assessments of the major determinants of yield variability
    at regional scale under future climate conditions are still underrepresented.
    In this study, we simulated maize yield in Northeast China at a reference period
    (1986–2005), and two future periods (2030 s: 2020–2039, 2050 s: 2040–2059) of
    Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) of SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 using
    Agricultural Production sIMulator (APSIM). We first characterized the variations
    of maize yield under climate change based on the simulations, and further investigated
    the key determinants of yield variability using machine learning techniques. The
    results suggest that maize yield would decrease by 14.8 % to 19.6 % (depending
    on the climate scenarios) compared to the reference period without adaption. Random
    forest performed best in explaining yield variability in a suite of machine learning
    models (extreme gradient boosting, gradient boosting, classification and regression
    tree, ridge and lasso regression and random forest), with a mean R2 of 0.77, a
    mean RMSE of 1239.2 kg/ha, a mean MAE of 885.1 kg/ha. Extreme climate indicators
    show a greater ability to explain yield variability in over half agro-ecological
    regions under higher warming levels such as SSP5-8.5. Cumulative precipitation
    (CPR) and compound drought and hot days (CDH) during growing seasons are the most
    important mean and extreme climate indicators affecting yield variability, respectively.
    Moreover, the effect sizes of CPR and CDH on yield variability are 1898 kg/ha
    and 5596 kg/ha, respectively. Therefore, CDH will be a key constraint on maize
    production. Future adaptive measures such as irrigation, breeding hot- or drought-tolerant
    cultivars should be implemented to enhance the resilience of maize crops in the
    face of climate change.'

    Global warming, along with the increasing frequency of climate extremes associated
    with this warming trend, is projected to continue in 21st century (Van et al.,
    2021). Climate change has far-reaching impacts on various sectors such as agriculture,
    water, and energy, of which agriculture is the highly sensitive one as it is directly
    exposed to the shifting climate conditions (Feng et al., 2020). There is growing
    evidence suggesting the negative impacts of global warming and climate extremes
    on crop yield, both in the observations and projections (Zhao et al., 2017, Lesk
    et al., 2016). Therefore, it is of paramount importance to understand the impacts
    of climate variability on crop yield, which will provide essential evidence for
    policymakers, farmers and breeders to make informed adaptions. Simulating crop
    yield is a prerequisite for exploring the climate-yield relationship under future
    climate conditions. Process-based crop models, statistical models, and machine
    learning techniques are commonly used approaches for simulating crop yield (Xiao
    et al., 2021, Feng et al., 2020, Stevens and Madani, 2016). Crop models can offer
    us in-depth physiological explanations for yield variability compared to statistical
    models and machine learning techniques (Meroni et al., 2021). However, the extensive
    data requirements, including soil characteristics, meteorological variables, and
    eco-physiological parameters needed to describe crop variability for crop models,
    impose limitations on their application at regional scale (Zhang et al., 2020).
    Once properly calibrated and validated with observed data, crop models can offer
    insights into the complex interactions between soil, crop, weather and management,
    which can contribute to develop effective strategies for mitigating the impacts
    of climate change on agriculture (Laux et al., 2010). The comprehensive impacts
    of climate variability on crop yield have primarily been investigated using statistical
    models (Ceglar et al., 2016). However, statistical models generally focused on
    establishing the regression relationships between meteorological variables and
    yield variability, but they may overlook the issue of multicollinearity among
    these variables. Furthermore, few studies have taken into consideration the effects
    of compound events on crop yield in constructing statistical and machine learning
    models. The effects of meteorological variables on crop yield will possibly be
    exaggerated or weakened without accounting for the multicollinearity of meteorological
    variables and compound climate extremes. Recently, machine learning has gained
    widespread usage in disentangling complex relationships within large datasets,
    which can be challenging for conventional statistical methods (Nayak et al., 2022).
    Climate variability can impact crop yield by limiting photosynthesis, accelerating
    phenological development, and reducing seed number or nutrient absorption during
    different phases of crop growth (Cohen et al., 2021). Crop sensitivity to climate
    variability is contingent upon the crop’s eco-physiological parameters and growing
    environment. In other words, the response of a crop to climate variability are
    crop-specific and region-specific (Leng and Huang, 2017). However, there is insufficient
    investigation into the climate-crop relationship at regional perspective to meet
    the demand for precise agricultural management. The Northeast China (NEC) is one
    of the important grain producing areas in China. Over the years, the grain yield
    in this region has shown remarkable growth, increasing from 3.70 × 107 tons in
    1980 to 16.54 × 107 tons in 2019, which accounted for 25 % of the total grain
    yield in the country (Li et al., 2016). And the area of maize occupies approximately
    52 % of total agriculture land in NEC (Li et al., 2021), highlighting the crucial
    role of maize production in the region in ensuring food security in China. However,
    maize production in NEC is highly sensitive to climate change as it is mainly
    a rain-fed crop in the region, more serious effect on maize will occur without
    the mitigating effect of irrigation (Wang et al., 2018b). Overall, there are still
    research gaps in investigating the key determinants of yield variability under
    future climate conditions at regional scale using methods that ignoring collinearity.
    In this study, we simulated maize yield at 0.25° ×0.25° resolution at a reference
    period (1986–2005), and two future periods (2030 s: 2020–2039, 2050 s:2040–2059)
    of Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) of SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5 using
    Agricultural Production sIMulator (APSIM). As shown in Fig. 1, our major objectives
    were: two-fold: (1) investigate the maize yield variability under future climate
    conditions at regional perspective, (2) identify the key meteorological variables
    affecting maize yield variability. Our results will provide valuable regional
    information on the impact of meteorological variables on maize production in NEC,
    which can be instrumental in guiding agricultural management practices to achieve
    a high and stable yield level in the region. Download : Download high-res image

    on Northeast China (NEC), a prominent grain production region in the country (Fig.
    2A). The prevailing climate type in the region is continental monsoon climate,
    with average annual temperature ranging from -1 °C to 9 °C and average annual
    precipitation ranging from 500 mm to 800 mm (Li et al., 2014). NEC is a base for
    commodity grain in China and boasts the third-largest black soil area globally.
    The total black soil area is about 1.09 million km2, constituting 12 % of the
    global black soil expanse. Approximately 20 % of China’s total grain yield is
    produced in the black soil regions. Nevertheless, the elevated intensity of land
    use, inadequate agricultural management, and the impact of climate change have
    led to soil erosion, posing great threat to the sustainable development of agricultural
    production (Xie et al., 2019). Research has shown that the annual losses of soil
    organic carbon in NEC reached up to 2.05 Mg ha−1 (Qiu et al., 2004). Download

    and agro-ecological regions We overlapped the boundary map of NEC onto the map
    of agricultural physical regionalization in China to obtain the Fig.S1. Subsequently,
    Region 2 (Fig.S1) was subdivided into three distinct sub-regions of II, III, and
    VI (Fig. 2B) using the provincial boundary to (1) obtain more detailed insights
    into the influence of climate change on yield variability; (2) account for the
    spatial heterogeneity of soil indicators across different provinces (Liu et al.,
    2009). The map depicting the maize planting region (Fig. 2C) was extracted from
    the dataset created by Luo et al. (2020a) (https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/jbs44b2hrk/2).
    The grids labelled as maize planting area for more than six consecutive years
    during 2000–2015 were used to generate the map. 2.3. Historical and future climate
    data The China Meteorological Forcing Dataset (CMFD) used for historical yield
    projections (1986–2005) is a reanalyzed dataset based on observations from more
    than 2000 meteorological sites, along with GLDAS and TRMM precipitation data (Yang
    et al., 2018). Correspondingly, the newest version of the NASA Earth Exchange
    Global Daily Downscaled Projections named NEX-GDDP-CMIP6 (Thrasher et al., 2022),
    was employed to conduct future yield projections at periods of 2030 s (2020–2039)
    and 2050 s (2040–2059). This CMIP6 climate dataset was created using the statistical
    downscaling algorithm (Wood et al., 2002, Wood et al., 2004), and it has been
    bias-corrected using the newest version of the Global Meteorological Forcing Dataset
    (GMFD). The CMFD and NEX-GDDP-CMIP6 are both at daily scale. The CMFD was interpolated
    from 0.1°×0.1° resolution to 0.25°×0.25° resolution using bilinear interpolation
    in Matlab to make it comparable with NEX-GDDP-CMIP6. Four variables including
    maximum temperature (Tmax), minimum temperature (Tmin), mean temperature (Tas),
    precipitation (Pr), and shortwave solar radiation (Srad) were input into the crop
    model to simulate maize yield, and the four variables along with mean temperature
    (Tas) were used to calculate mean and extreme climate indicators (see section
    3.3). Overall, we employed five General Circulation Moldes (GCMs) in each of the
    SSP scenario. The information of climate dataset used in this study are summarized
    in Table 1. Table 1. Summary of climate data used in this study. Dataset Model

    for use in the land surface modeling was employed to extract the soil variables
    such as PH, organic matter fraction, sand, silt, bulk density and clay fraction
    for APSIM-Maize (Shangguan et al., 2013). The resolution of the dataset is 30
    arc-seconds and the variation of soil property was captured by eight layers to
    the depth of 2.3 m (i.e., 0––0.045, 0.045––0.091, 0.091––0.166, 0.166––0.289,
    0.289––0.493, 0.493––0.829, 0.829––1.383 and 1.383––2.296 m). 3. Method 3.1. Crop
    parameters for APSIM-Maize APSIM (https://www.apsim.info/apsim-model/) is a process-based
    model that widely used in simulating climate change impacts on crop yield (Wang
    et al., 2018a). In APSIM, TTEE (thermal time required from emergence to end of
    juvenile, °C d) and TTFM (thermal time required from flower to maturity, °C d)
    are used to control maize development, while the GGR (potential grain growth rate,
    mg grain-1 d-1) and HGNM (maximum grain numbers per head, grain-1) are related
    to maize productivity. Calibrating these parameters at each grid is unpractical
    due to limited on-farm observations. We simulated maize yield and phenology using
    eight typical varieties (Table 2) at each grid during period of 2000–2015, then
    variety reproduced the maturing dates from the maize phenology dataset from Luo
    et al. (2020b) best was selected as the default variety in the grid. We validated
    the results using yield records from agro-meteorological sites (Fig. 2C) and from
    city-level statistical yearbooks. As shown in Fig. 3, the R2 values are 0.65 and
    0.82 for point and regional scale, respectively. And RMSE values are 1011.1 kg/ha
    and 529.5 kg/ha for point and region scale, respectively. Table 2. The cultivar

    simulated yields with observed yields from agro-meteorological sites (point scale)
    and city-level statistical yearbook (regional scale). 3.2. Crop modelling Several
    basic settings should be made before running the crop model: (1) the irrigation
    amount was set to zero as maize in NEC is major a rain-fed crop (Li et al., 2022,
    Yang et al., 2015); (2) fertilizer was set to 300 kg/ha urea at sowing to fully
    meet nutrient need of maize growth; (3) sowing density was set to 67,500 plants/ha,
    (4) sowing date was fixed in each grid, which was acquired through interpolating
    the sowing dates recorded in agro-meteorological sites; (5) sowing depth and sowing
    space were set to 5 cm and 60 cm, respectively. The APSIM-maize doesn’t consider
    the effect of changes in CO2 concentration on maize yield. However, the transpiration
    rate of maize increased 37 % as the concentration of CO2 increased from 350 ppm
    to 700 ppm (Lobell et al., 2015). Therefore, we modified the transpiration rate
    in the xml file of APSIM-maize according to the linear response of maize transpiration
    to CO2. Calculations of CO2 were referenced to Xiao et al. (2020), and the corresponding
    equations are shown in supplementary text 1. 3.3. Calculating mean and extreme
    climate indicators We chose 10 climate indicators categorized as mean and extreme
    climate to explain the yield variability under climate change (Table 3). The climate
    indicators including mean daily maximum temperature (MAT); mean daily minimum
    temperature (MIT); cumulative precipitation (CPR); cumulative shortwave radiation
    (CSR); cumulative effective growing degree days (GDD); cumulative compound drought
    and hot days (CDH); cumulative compound drought and cold days (CDC);cumulative
    days of daily maximum temperature higher than 30 °C (OCA); cumulative days of
    daily minimum temperature lower than 8 °C (OCI); and cumulative drought days (TDR).
    The drought and high temperature/low temperature occur simultaneous in a day was
    defined as a compound drought and hot/cold day (CDH/CDC). The time window for
    calculating the climate indicators was from sowing to maturing. Table 3. Mean

    of daily evapotranspiration deficit during growing seasons of reference period,
    is the actual daily evapotranspiration deficit (mm/d). The 30th quantile of DEDI
    was set as the threshold for the drought day (Zhang et al., 2022). GDD was calculated

    for maize, is the daily average temperature on day i. 3.4. Statistical analysis
    Maize yield variation was calculated using equation as follows: (3) where represents
    the maize yield changes under the climate scenarios of SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5 and
    SSP5-8.5 in 2030 s and 2050 s. is the average yield in 2030 s or 2050 s, is the
    average yield in reference period. We calculated at each 0.25°×0.25° grid. The
    daily data of the climate variables (Tmax, Tmin, Tas, Srad, and Pr) from NEX-GDDP-CMIP6
    were validated for the period of 1979–2014 by comparing them with observed data
    from CMFD. The Mean Bias (MB, Eq. (5)) were used for validation. (4) where is
    number of simulations/observations, is the simulated values of five GCMs. Additionally,
    we calculated the Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r) between average simulated
    and observed values of 1979–2014 period in all land pixels to evaluate the moder
    performance in capturing the spatial variations in climate variables. 3.5. Identifying
    the key determinants of yield variability We first compared the abilities of a
    suit of machine learning models (lasso; ridge; recursive partitioning, rpart;
    gradient boosting machine, gbm; extreme gradient boosting, xgbTree; random forest,
    rf) in reproducing the yield variability to determine the best model. In this
    step, we initiated the optimization of hyperparameters for each model using the
    random search method within the caret R package. Following this, we employed the
    train() function from the same package to perform 10-fold cross-validation with
    data resampling to evaluate the model’s performance in simulating yield variability
    through the coefficient of determination (R2), the root mean square error (RMSE),
    and the mean absolute error (MAE), which were calculated as follows: (6) (7) (8)
    where Mi represents the APSIM simulated maize yield, Pi represents the predicted
    maize yield by machine learning, and Pmean represents the average predicted maize
    yield by machine learning. By doing this, the random forest was evaluated as the
    best model to explain yield variability. To compare the relative importance of
    mean and extreme climate, we first trained random forest on a subset of climate
    indicators representing only mean or extreme climate (Table 3), respectively.
    Then we calculated the difference in explained variance (R2) between mean climate
    and extreme climate of the random forest models. The procedures described above
    were repeated 10 times, and the average difference in explained variance was utilized
    to assess the relative significance of mean and extreme climate on yield variation.
    To evaluate the key climate indicators affecting yield variability, we initially
    employed the rfPermute R package to measure variable importance. A significant
    advantage of rfPermute is its ability to provide us standardized importance for
    each climate indicator along with its corresponding significance level. The metirc
    named increase in MSE (%) was used to demonstrate the importance of climate indicators,
    that is, the more influential a climate indicator is, the higher MSE it can generate.
    Subsequently, we employed accumulated local effect (ALE) plots to compare the
    effect sizes of climate indicators on yield variation. These plots quantitatively
    illustrate their influence on yield variation. ALE plots offer several advantages
    in quantifying effect sizes: (1) ALE plots are unbiased even in the presence of
    a correlation feature space; (2) ALE plots exhibit faster computing speed; (3)
    ALE plots directly show the relative impacts of feature changes on yield variation;
    (4) ALE plots effectively identify the relationship between features and predictors,
    disregarding outliers. The iml R package was used to draw the ALE plots for the
    key determinants. 4. Results 4.1. Performance of climate model outputs and climate
    change characteristics The performance of climate model outputs was evaluated
    by analyzing the MB and r values of climate variables of precipitation (Pr), shortwave
    solar radiation (Srad), maximum temperature (Tmax), minimum temperature (Tmin),
    and mean temperature (Tas), considering the monthly values (Fig. 4A, B, C, D,
    E), the spatial distribution of MB (Fig. 4F, G, H, I, J), and r between simulated
    and observed data for all land pixels (Fig. 4K, L, M, N, O). Results indicate
    that the five GCMs exhibit similar accuracy in capturing monthly variations in
    climate variables, yet they tend to underestimate Pr in June, Tmin in March and
    June, and Tas in February. Conversely, these models overestimate Srad from April
    to July, Tmax in May and August. This overestimation of Tmax and underestimation
    of Tmin results in low bias in Tas. At regional level, climate projections obviously
    overestimate Pr and Tmax, but underestimate Srad and Tmin. But in most regions,
    the MB values fall within an acceptable range. The average MB of the region shows
    maximum monthly absolute MB for Pr, Srad, Tmax, Tmin, and Tas at 7.0 mm month−1,
    2.3 MJ m−2 day−1, 1.7 °C, 1.7 °C, and 1.2 °C. MB values for temperature are lower
    than the acceptable threshold of 2 °C (Flato et al., 2013). Underestimation of
    Srad was also found in Brazil, with MB for Srad falling below the acceptable threshold
    of 4 MJ m−2 day−1 (Dias et al., 2024). Monthly r values between simulated data
    and observed data for all land pixels are mostly greater than 0.8, indicating
    the strong performance in capturing spatial variations in climate variables within
    the region. Download : Download high-res image (753KB) Download : Download full-size

    as observations minus simulations. The average cliamte conditions characterized
    by climate varibles of Pr, Srad, Tmax, Tmin, Tas are listed in Table 4. Climate
    change will incareae all the climate variables. Specifically, slightly increase
    of Pr (4.5 ∼ 8.7 %) and relatively higher increase of Srad (12.0 %∼14.5 %) are
    projected. Notably, the increase of Srad is possibly overestimated according to
    the comparison between simulated data and observed data (Fig. 4G). The increase
    of mean air temperature is higher than 1.4 °C, indicating more heat resources
    can be used for maize production in future. But the increase of Tmax also stress
    the higher risk of heat-related climate extremes. Table 4. Regional multi-model

    impacts on maize yield in all agro-ecological regions without adaption such as
    irrigation, genetic improvemet (Fig. 5). On average, climate change will decrease
    maize yield of the whole region about 13.1 %∼27.5 % across climate scenarios.
    Our results suggest moderate yield decrease under SSP1-2.6 (13.1 %∼14.7 %), but
    severe decrease under SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios (25.7 %∼27.5 %), indicating
    the negative impact will increase with the warming level. The magnitude of climate
    change impacts on mazie yield show obviously spatial heterogenecity. The average
    yield losses of all scenarios in the agro-ecological regions range from 16.2 %
    to 26.6 %. Region III will be the most vulnerable to climate change, with the
    yield decrease of 13.6 %∼34.1 % (the range describes the differences among climate
    scenarios). However, Regions IV and VI show higher resistance than other agro-ecological
    regions to climate change with the yield decrease of 7.5 %∼21.0 % and 10.6 %∼21.8
    %, respectively. There is a obviously pattern that climate change impact on maize
    yield increase from south to north, and decrease from east to west. Download :

    to yield variability The ability of six machine learning models in explaining
    maize yield variability was evaluated using R2, RMSE and MAE (Fig. 6). The two
    regression-based methods, lasso and ridge, demonstrate comparable performance
    in simulating maize yield, with both methods achieving a mean R2 of 0.54. Additionally,
    the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) are nearly equal
    for both methods. The single tree-based method of rpart outperforms the regression-based
    methods, with a mean R2 of 0.63, a mean RMSE of 1580.9 kg/ha, and a mean MAE of
    1142.7 kg/ha. The multi-tree-based methods, gbm and xgbTree, outperform both the
    regression-based and single tree-based methods, achieving a mean R2 of 0.73, a
    mean RMSE of 1318.6 kg/ha, and a mean MAE of 982.3 kg/ha across the two methods.
    Finally, the multi-tree-based method of rf exhibits the highest performance in
    explaining maize yield, with a mean R2 of 0.77, a mean RMSE of 1239.2 kg/ha, a
    mean MAE of 885.1 kg/ha. Consequently, the rf method was utilized to assess the
    primary determinants of maize yield variability. Download : Download high-res

    lower whiskers represent the maximum and minimum R squared values, respectivaly.
    The red diamonds indicate the average R squared value. (For interpretation of
    the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the
    web version of this article.) Mean climate will exert higher impact on maize yield
    under low warming scenario like SSP1-2.6. However, under higher warming scenario
    of SSP5-8.5, extreme climate will significantly influence maize yield, as its
    explained variance on yield variability is higher than that of mean climate in
    more than half of the agro-ecological regions across climate scenarios (Fig. 7).
    This effect is particularly evident in Regions I, II, III, and IV. The impacts
    of extreme and mean climate on yield variability show substantial spatial heterogeneity
    across agro-ecological regions. Moreover, the importance of extreme and mean climate
    in influencing yield variability is subject to changes with varying climate scenarios.

    has a greater influence on yield variability than mean climate, while positve
    R2 values suggest the opposite. 4.4. Variables importance and effect sizes on
    yield variability The mean and extreme climate indicators (Table 3) all have significant
    effects (p < 0.01) on yield variability. Notably, significant spatial heterogeneity
    exists in the importance of these variables on yield variability across the agro-ecological
    regions (Fig.S2∼Fig.S9). Fig. 8 illustrates the variable importance on maize yield
    variability across six climate scenarios. Among the mean climate indicators, CPR
    emerges as the most crucial factor governing yield variability across all climate
    scenarios. CSR and GDD are other important mean climate indicators significantly
    influencing yield variability. Drought-related extreme climate indicators play
    significant role in regulating yield variability. Furthermore, besides CDH, other
    extreme climate indicators such as CDC and TDR also play significant roles in
    regulating yield variability. Download : Download high-res image (564KB) Download

    climate indicators, i.e., CPR and CDH on maize yield variability were compared
    using the accumulated local effects (ALE) plots (Fig. 9∼Fig. 10). Overall, CDH
    has higher effect size on yield variability than CPR. On average, the effect sizes
    of CDH and CPR are 5596 and 1898 kg/ha, respectively. Specifically, the increase
    28 CDH days can lead to average yield loss of 1363 kg/ha. On contrary, the decrease
    41 CDH days can improve yield by 4233 kg/ha. As for CPR, sharply increase in yield
    variability is projected with the changes of CPR from −200 mm to 164 mm. Additional
    water supply of approximately 164 mm will bring about yield improvement of 1044
    kg/ha. However, CPR decrease 199 mm can lead to yield loss of 558 kg/ha. Download

    Discussions 5.1. Reliability of yield simulations Predicting regional-scale crop
    yield using crop models is challenging due to limited observations required to
    calibrate the model parameters (Liu et al., 2019). Several upscaling strategies
    have been reported in previous literatures, including using one representative
    cultivar in an agro-ecological region (Luo et al., 2021), coupling crop model
    with machine learning techniques (Zhang et al., 2021), assimilating remote sensing
    data to calibrate parameters (Zhuo et al., 2022), and employing the average of
    virtual cultivars generated from cultivars planted in an agro-ecological region
    (Chen et al., 2021). In this study, the variety of eight typical maize varieties
    in NEC that reproduced mature dates from a remote sensing dataset developed by
    Luo et al. (2020b) best was determined as the originally planted variety in each
    grid. We used yield records from 44 agro-meteorological sites to validate the
    model accuracy. Results show strong correlation between simulations and observations
    with R2 and RMSE are 0.65 and 1011.1 kg/ha, respectively (Fig. 3). Furthermore,
    we used city-level yield statistics to validate the model accuracy at regional
    scale. The validation revealed a mean R2 value of 0.82 and a mean Root Mean Square
    Error (RMSE) of 529.5 kg/ha. The precision our study is similar to previous studies
    that predicting regional-scale maize yield. For instance, Zhang et al. (2021)
    combined machine learning with a crop model to simulate regional-scale maize yield
    in China and achieved an R2 of 0.56 when comparing the simulations with records
    from agro-meteorological sites. Similarly, Cheng et al. (2022) utilized random
    forest to simulate wheat and maize yield at high resolution, obtaining an R2 of
    0.51 for wheat and an R2 of 0.65 for maize when comparing the simulations with
    in-situ observations. Notably, precision of simulating crop yield at regional-scale
    is generally lower than that at site-scale. Huang et al. (2020) obtained R2 values
    ranging from 0.74 to 0.98 when simulating maize yield after calibrating the model
    using in-situ observations. 5.2. Extreme climate explain yield variability more
    than mean climate under higher warming levels The impact of climate change climate
    extremes on crop yield has gained increased attention in the last decades (Feng
    et al., 2019b). We find that under SSP1-2.6 and SSP2-4.5 scenarios in 2030 s,
    yield variability in the majority of agro-ecological regions will be predominantly
    controlled by mean climate. The pattern is expected to change under SSP2-4.5 scenario
    in 2050 s and SSP5-8.5 scenario in both 2030 s and 205 s, with extreme climate
    indicators explaining yield variability more than mean climate indicators. The
    findings suggest a stronger impact of extreme climate on crop yields as temperature
    rise (Fig. 7). A previous study also found that climate extremes exert significantly
    negative impacts on soybean yield in NEC (Guo et al., 2022). The reasons for the
    increasing importance of climate extremes on yield variability are twofold: (1)
    the frequency of climate extremes will increase with rising temperatures; (2)
    crop yield responds more significantly to climate extremes compared to mean climate.
    For instance, Shi et al. (2021) highlighted that crops grown in NEC were more
    susceptible to the impacts of droughts. Our results demonstrate the importance
    of climate extremes on yield variability, and indicate this importance will increase
    with rising temperatures. The local maize community should prioritize efforts
    to mitigate the damage caused by climate extremes on maize yield. 5.3. Compound
    drought and hot days during growing seasons play important role in governing yield
    variability Maize yield projected to decrease in the future without adaption (Fig.
    5), which aligns with previous studies that focused on the impact of climate change
    on crop yield (Feng et al., 2019a, Stevens and Madani, 2016). On average, maize
    yield in NEC is projected to decrease by 13.1 % to 27.5 % under future cliamte.
    The yield decrease can probably be attributed to (1): climate warming shortens
    maize growing priod, particularly from flowering to maturing, which is a critical
    phase for achieing high yield (Asseng et al., 2015); (2): the increasing frequency
    of climate extremes, such as compound hot and drought days, affecting the formation
    of organic matter. Our results demonsrate that extreme climate significantly impacts
    yield variability in NEC (Fig. 6 and Fig. 7), consistent with studies by Guo et
    al. (2022) and Chen et al. (2020). Notably, the most crucial extreme climate indicator
    affecting yield variability is CDH (Fig. 8), followed by TDR. As the frequency
    of CDH stresses is incrreasing in observations and future climate projections
    (Li et al., 2023, Lu et al., 2018), the impact of CDH stresses on maize yield
    will increase in the future. For example, Wu et al. (2023) investigate the impacts
    of different types of cliamte extremes on maize yield in China, and found that
    the negative impacts of agriculture compound drought and hot events on maize yield
    increased during the past decades at both natianl and regional scales. Feng et
    al., (2019b) found that compound drought and hot events caused highest risk on
    global maize yield reduction than individual drought/hot events during 1961–2014.
    The compound drought and hot days during growing seasons play a significant role
    in governing the yield variability (Fig. 7), with its effect size on yield variability
    being the highest (Fig. 10). For example, an increase of 28 additional compound
    drought and hot days during maize growing seasons, compared to reference period,
    can result in yield loss of 1363 kg/ha. Indeed, various studies have demenstrated
    the negative effects of cliamte extremes on yield stability (Leng and Hall, 2019,
    Li et al., 2019, Lesk et al., 2016), and recently, there has been growing attention
    towards investigating the impacts of compound climate extremes on crop. 5.4. Implications
    and uncertainties Currently, maize production in NEC relies primarily on rainfall.
    However, providing an additional 164 mm of water can significantly increase yield
    by approximately 1044 kg/ha (Fig.9). Given the potential yield benefit of providing
    moderate water to maize, it is critical to carefully plan and prioritize irrigation,
    particular in regions where rainfall is decreasing. Our findings suggest that,
    under higher warming levels, extreme climate will play a more significant role
    than mean climate in determining yield variability. Moreover, we have highlighted
    the crucial role of CDH in maize yield, for instance, an increase of 28 CDH days
    could lead to yield loss of 1363 kg/ha (Fig. 10). This emphasizes the need to
    breed resilient cultivars that can withstand drought and heat in order to adapt
    to climate change. Furthermore, the increase in air temperature enables the potential
    for planting varieties with longer growth duration to achieve higher yield, particular
    in mountainous and high latitude regions. In this study, we focused on the impact
    of climate change on maize yield, as well as the key drivers of yield variability
    in future, based on yield simulations from crop model rather than historical observations.
    To enhance the reliability of our projections, we validated our findings by comparing
    them with historical observations at both site and regional scales (Fig. 3). However,
    uncertainties persist due to climate projections (Dokoohaki et al., 2021, Mueller
    et al., 2021). For example, the overestimation of Tmax in climate projections
    may lead to an overestimation of the effect size of CDH on yield variability.
    Moreover, the overestimation of Srad can result in overestimation of future yield.
    Additionally, uncertainties can be attributed to the structures of crop models
    (Dokoohaki et al., 2021, Wang et al., 2017), as crop models demonstrate limited
    ability in accounting for factors like pests, weeds, and climate extremes such
    as drought, excessive rainfall, and heatwaves, which impact crop yield (Shahhosseini
    et al., 2021). Using an ensemble of crop models can help quantify uncertainties
    arising from differences in model structures (Li et al., 2015). Nevertheless,
    even with model ensemble mean, complete reduction of uncertainties may not achievable.
    To improve model performance, a possible approach involves optimizing the relationship
    between environmental factors with crop growth (Asseng et al., 2019). The response
    of crops to climate is closely related to their growth parameters, but the eight
    typical listed in Table 2 may not fully represent the possible responses of maize.
    Therefore, we propose using extensive field observations to refine the outputs
    of crop models to improve their accuracy in predicting regional-scale crop yield.
    6. Conclusions The dataset generated by APSIM-Maize, which characeterizes maize
    production at a 0.25 degrees horizontal resolution under three Socioeconomic Pathways-
    SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, and SSP5-8.5- in Northeast China (NEC) was emplyed to investigate
    the impacts of cliamte change and the determinants of yield variability. The major
    conclusions are as follows: (1) Climte change is projected to negatively affect
    maize yield in NEC, with a decline ranging from 13.1 % to 27.5 % (considering
    differences in climate scenarios) compared to the reference period of 1986–2005.
    (2) Random forest demonstrated superior performance among the regression- or tree-based
    machine learning methods used for predicting maize yield, with a mean R2 of 0.77,
    a mean RMSE of 1239.2 kg/ha, a mean MAE of 885.1 kg/ha. (3) Under lower warming
    levels, the mean climate exhibits a stronger ability to explain yield variability.
    However, this pattern changes adversely with rising temperatures. (4) CPR and
    CDH were identified as the most important mean and extreme climate indicators,
    repectively, influencing yield variability. Moreover, CDH has the highest effect
    size on yield variability, making it a key determinant of maize yield in the future.
    Other climate indicators such as CSR and TDR also play important role in regulating
    yield variability. CRediT authorship contribution statement Chuanwei Zhang: Conceptualization,

  key_findings: '1) Climate change will significantly decrease regional maize yields.

    2) Climate change will increase the importance of extreme climate on maize yield
    variability.

    3) Cumulative precipitation (CPR) and compound drought and hot days (CDH) are
    the most important factors affecting maize yield variability.'
  limitations: '1) The study focused on the impact of climate change on maize yield,
    as well as the key drivers of yield variability in future, based on yield simulations
    from crop model rather than historical observations.

    2) Uncertainties persist due to climate projections and the structures of crop
    models.'

    Africa (MENA) region. The region, including Morocco, predominantly has rainfed
    production systems, declining water supply, and increasing trends and effects
    of rainfall variability and climate extremes leading to poor crop yield and yield
    stability. The objectives of this study were to understand major factors determining
    wheat yield and water use efficiency (WUE); assess the interaction of genotype
    × environment × management on crop yield and field- and crop-water use efficiencies;
    and determine the water-limited yield gaps of genotypes under different agronomic
    management practices in the Mediterranean climate of Morocco. Four years (2015/16–2018/19)
    of on-station experiments investigating genotype (ten genotypes including seven
    advanced line and three commercial varieties), seeding time (17 November vs. 29
    December), and water management (rainfed vs. supplementary irrigation), was conducted
    at Merchouch research station, Morocco. The results showed that durum wheat yield
    mostly varied due to year (rainfall) by 43%, followed by water management × year
    (23%), year × seeding time (15%), and genotype (7%), with the highest yield (7.15
    t ha−1) observed in 2018 (wet year) and the lowest in 2019 (dry year). Across
    years, not only the rainfall amount but also its distribution during the crop
    growing season caused yield variability. In low-rainfall years, supplementary
    irrigation (28–166 mm) increased yield by 2.12–3.27 t ha−1 compared to rainfed
    conditions. The significant (p < 0.01) year × seeding time × genotype effect on
    grain yield and WUEs indicates that the response of genotype and seeding time
    varied with rainfall amount and distribution as the water-limited yield gap in
    rainfed conditions appeared to be more than 2 t ha−1. In both supplementary irrigated
    and rainfed systems, the machine learning model showed the effect of different
    climatic (rainfall and temperature) and management (seeding time, genotype, and
    irrigation) factors determining yield, yield attributes, and WUEs. The total rainfall
    remained the most important factor explaining variation in rainfed wheat yield
    followed by the temperature at flowering, mid- and early-season rainfall, and
    genotype in order of importance. Similarly, seasonal rainfall was the most important
    factor explaining variation in grain yield followed by early-season rainfall,
    days to flowering, temperature at flowering, irrigation amount, seeding time,
    and genotype in supplementary irrigated durum wheat. Our study clearly shows that
    yield is highly related to rainfall in rainfed drylands, and the selection of
    high WUE variety and crop management practices are the key to improving the resilience
    and sustainability of durum wheat in Morocco and similar production environments
    in the MENA region.

    Abstract Durum wheat (Triticum turgidum subsp. durum), considered better drought
    tolerant, is the most cultivated wheat in Morocco and in the Middle East and North
    Africa (MENA) region. The region, including Morocco, predominantly has rainfed
    production systems, declining water supply, and increasing trends and effects
    of rainfall variability and climate extremes leading to poor crop yield and yield
    stability. The objectives of this study were to understand major factors determining
    wheat yield and water use efficiency (WUE); assess the interaction of genotype
    × environment × management on crop yield and field- and crop-water use efficiencies;
    and determine the water-limited yield gaps of genotypes under different agronomic
    management practices in the Mediterranean climate of Morocco. Four years (2015/16–2018/19)
    of on-station experiments investigating genotype (ten genotypes including seven
    advanced line and three commercial varieties), seeding time (17 November vs. 29
    December), and water management (rainfed vs. supplementary irrigation), was conducted
    at Merchouch research station, Morocco. The results showed that durum wheat yield
    mostly varied due to year (rainfall) by 43%, followed by water management × year
    (23%), year × seeding time (15%), and genotype (7%), with the highest yield (7.15
    t ha−1) observed in 2018 (wet year) and the lowest in 2019 (dry year). Across
    years, not only the rainfall amount but also its distribution during the crop
    growing season caused yield variability. In low-rainfall years, supplementary
    irrigation (28–166 mm) increased yield by 2.12–3.27 t ha−1 compared to rainfed
    conditions. The significant (p < 0.01) year × seeding time × genotype effect on
    grain yield and WUEs indicates that the response of genotype and seeding time
    varied with rainfall amount and distribution as the water-limited yield gap in
    rainfed conditions appeared to be more than 2 t ha−1. In both supplementary irrigated
    and rainfed systems, the machine learning model showed the effect of different
    climatic (rainfall and temperature) and management (seeding time, genotype, and
    irrigation) factors determining yield, yield attributes, and WUEs. The total rainfall
    remained the most important factor explaining variation in rainfed wheat yield
    followed by the temperature at flowering, mid- and early-season rainfall, and
    genotype in order of importance. Similarly, seasonal rainfall was the most important
    factor explaining variation in grain yield followed by early-season rainfall,
    days to flowering, temperature at flowering, irrigation amount, seeding time,
    and genotype in supplementary irrigated durum wheat. Our study clearly shows that
    yield is highly related to rainfall in rainfed drylands, and the selection of

    irrigationSeeding time 1. Introduction Wheat (durum, Triticum turgidum subsp.
    durum and bread, Triticum aestivum) is the major food crop grown on 16.8 million
    ha of rainfed area in 21 Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region countries
    (FAOSTAT, 2023). The region has high food and cultural value of wheat mainly for
    preparing bread, couscous, pasta, and other traditional cuisines. Data from FAOSTAT
    show that in 2020 the MENA region produced 40.9 million tons of wheat but also
    imported 42.8 million tons of wheat and wheat products worth 11.5 billion USD,
    and the import increased to 0.77 million tons year−1 (∼311 million USD) during
    2000–2020. Wheat yield in the MENA region (except Egypt, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia)
    is low (2.0 ± 0.72 t ha−1) and varies considerably among countries and years,
    and highly depends on irrigation regimes and rainfall amount and its distribution
    (FAOSTAT, 2023, Devkota et al., 2022b). In the region, the annual wheat productivity
    growth rate has only been 6 kg ha−1 year−1 (FAOSTAT, 2023) in the last 20 years,
    while the yield gap between experimental station and farmers’ yields is 1.2–1.7
    t ha−1 and between simulated and farmers’ yields is 2.1–3.1 t ha−1 (Pala et al.,
    2011). Biophysical factors such as rainfed production systems with increasing
    rainfall variability in timing, amount and intensity and a considerable decrease
    in annual rainfall; increase in temperature; increasing frequencies of droughts,
    winds, and extreme events (Pala et al., 2011, Schilling et al., 2012); and poor
    land and crop management practices (Devkota et al., 2022b, Devkota and Yigezu,
    2020, Kassam et al., 2012, Mrabet et al., 2012) are the major constraints for
    higher yields in the Mediterranean rainfed environment. In Morocco, wheat is grown
    on 2.8 million ha under rainfed conditions (FAOSTAT, 2023). In the country, winter
    cereals occupy more than 55% of agricultural areas, with common and durum wheat
    accounting for about 75% (Bouras et al., 2020). Durum wheat, considered more tolerant
    to drought than common wheat, is one of the oldest and most cultivated wheat in
    the MENA region and under Mediterranean climatic conditions (Padovan et al., 2020,
    Xynias et al., 2020). In Morocco, wheat is cultivated in diverse soil and climatic
    conditions with a range of rainfall patterns (El Mourid and Karrou, 1996, Pala
    et al., 2011). The variation in the amount and distribution of seasonal rainfall
    (Devkota et al., 2022a), and alteration of the hydrological cycle as a result
    of climate change (Bates et al., 2008), are mostly responsible for the temporal
    and spatial yield variability in Morocco and also in the MENA region. Previous
    studies have reported plenty of opportunities to improve wheat productivity by
    closing the yield gaps adopting good agronomic management for both rainfed and
    irrigated wheat (Devkota and Yigezu, 2020, Pala et al., 2011). Wheat is highly
    sensitive to water deficit and temperature fluctuation during the reproductive
    and grain-filling periods (Alghabari et al., 2014, Farooq et al., 2011). In the
    region, most rainfall occurs during autumn and winter and crops are frequently
    exposed to water deficit (moderate stress) around anthesis and grain filling (Giunta
    et al., 1993), and drought generally limits wheat yields (Yang et al., 2021).
    Under such conditions, adjustment in planting time and application of supplementary
    irrigation can improve productivity and yield stability (Karrou, 2013, Karrou
    and Oweis, 2012, Pala et al., 2011). Given the limited ability to utilize new
    sources of water and the declining rainfall amounts (Nicholson et al., 2018) in
    the present and also the future, efficient use of available rainfall water is
    needed for sustaining wheat production – for this optimal seeding time is the
    key. When water resources are available, supplemental irrigation in rainfed areas
    can boost wheat productivity by 3–4 times, and the enhancement of supplementary
    irrigation facility or efficient utilization of rainfall water is key for increasing
    yield (Pala et al., 2011). Similarly, considering the biophysical environment,
    to achieve stable yields with resilience under variable climatic conditions, it
    is critical to develop appropriate genetic and integrated agronomic management
    practices (Padovan et al., 2020). Appropriate sowing time and better cultivar
    choice are among the key factors allowing the sensitive stages of wheat to escape
    adverse environmental conditions (Bassu et al., 2009, Ferrise et al., 2010, Tapley
    et al., 2013). Adjustment of seeding time and choice of appropriate variety are
    low-cost key factors for improving wheat yield (Bassu et al., 2009, Heng et al.,
    2007). Previous studies have shown that advancing planting time helps raise wheat
    productivity by improving crop establishment and allowing crops to fully utilize
    rainwater (Heng et al., 2007, Piggin et al., 2015, Toumi et al., 2016) and avoid
    frost, heat, or drought stress during anthesis and grain filling (Ababaei and
    Chenu, 2020). Further, yield potential and resource utilization efficiency vary
    with variety, soil type, and climatic conditions (Wang et al., 2015). The growth,
    phenological development, maturity duration, and yield potential of a variety
    determine its potential for adaptation in a given environment and any breeding
    program needs to manipulate the genetic combination to customize varieties for
    the targeted environment and management practices (Dowla et al., 2018, Reynolds
    et al., 1999). To address these issues, several research efforts have been made
    to develop wheat varieties tolerant to drought and high-temperature stress (Alemu
    et al., 2021, Sadras and Podems, 2020). However, due to significant genotype ×
    environment × management interaction, development of suitable and broadly adapted
    varieties is complicated (Bänziger and Cooper, 2001, Basford and Cooper, 1998).
    It is also important to understand major climatic, management, genotype, and genotype
    x management factors determining crop growth, productivity, and water use efficiency
    (WUE) to achieve stable yields under variable and changing production environments.
    The MENA region, including the study area, had high inter and intra-variability
    in rainfall patterns and temperature (World Bank, 2021). Under such conditions,
    applying supplemental irrigation and optimal planting time can help to minimize
    water-limited yield gaps and stabilize yield, especially in low and variable-rainfall
    years (Kheir et al., 2021, Shen et al., 2021). Previous genotype × environment
    × management studies focussed more on developing agronomic management practices
    to improve the productivity of the specific genotype. However, selection of genotypes
    that are best fit on the specific agronomic practices and production environment,
    which is considered an adaptation strategy under climate crises, is missing. Thus,
    the objectives of this study were to assess the interaction of seeding time, water
    management and genotype on durum wheat productivity and WUE; determine the contribution
    of different production factors on yield and WUE using machine learning; and determine
    the water-limited yield gaps under different genotype and management conditions
    from medium term (four years with contrasting rainfall) field experimentation
    in the rainfed Mediterranean environments of Morocco. 2. Materials methods 2.1.
    Experimental site, soil, and climate Field experiments were conducted for four
    years at the ICARDA research farm in Merchouch (33°36′41″N, 6°42′45″W, 390 m a.s.l.),
    75 km east of Rabat, Morocco for four crop growing seasons (November–June) of
    2015/2016, 2016/2017, 2017/2018, and 2018/2019; hereafter referred to as 2016,
    2017, 2018, and 2019, respectively. The climate of the study site is typically
    Mediterranean with hot and dry summers and cold and wet winters, and highly variable
    annual rainfall across years. The long-term (1985–2021) annual rainfall in the
    experimental site Merchouch was 440 mm with mean annual air temperatures of 19.2
    °C (maximum 22.7 °C and minimum 15.85 °C) (Fig. 1). Weather parameters such as
    temperature, rainfall, evapotranspiration (ET) for the experimental year were
    taken from the automated weather measuring device using iMETOS 3.3 (https://metos.at/en/
    imetos 33/) installed in the research station. Download : Download high-res image

    is classified as a gray Vertisol of clay-loam texture (47.6% clay and 41% loam
    content) with large cracks appearing during the dry season. The soil has 1.65%
    organic carbon, 105 mg kg−1 available K2O, and 34 mg kg−1 assimilable P2O5. 2.2.
    Experimental design and treatments The experiment used a split-split plot design
    with three replications per treatment. Seeding time, i.e., timely (early November)
    vs. late (late December) was applied as the main plots; water management, i.e.,
    rainfed vs. supplemental irrigation, was applied as a sub-plot factor; and genotype,
    i.e., 10 different genotypes, was applied as sub-sub-plots. In total, there were
    40 treatments and 120 experimental plots. Genotypes were shown in 7 m × 2.6 m
    plots with row spacing of 20 cm (12 rows). Details of the experimental layout
    are presented in Fig. 2. Download : Download high-res image (571KB) Download :

    Center for Agriculture Research for Dry Areas (ICARDA) Research Station, Merchouch,
    Morocco. Different colors represent water management. The first seeding plots
    were seeded on 17 November (SD1) and the second seeding plots were seeded on 29
    December (SD2) each year. For the water management treatment, supplemental irrigation
    was applied through drip (the irrigation belt was patch-type with dripper flow
    rate of 2.3 L h−1, working pressure of 0.2 MPa and placed between two rows of
    wheat) based on soil field capacity. In supplemental irrigation, irrigation scheduling
    was carried out through in-situ measurement of soil moisture content by installing
    TDR (Time-domain reflectometry) based sensors TRIME-IT/-EZ (Germany). The TDR
    tubes with 1.5 m length were installed in all plots up to 90 cm depth after crop
    establishment in each growing season. Soil moisture was recorded at weekly intervals
    and irrigation water was applied when available soil moisture content in the soil
    profile dropped to 60%. The amount of water applied was calculated from the irrigation
    duration and the water discharge rate from each dripper. Total amount of water
    applied in the supplemental irrigation treatment is presented in Table 1. Table

    and recently released durum wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. durum) genotypes developed
    by ICARDA were included in the experiment, and three commercially grown released
    varieties, i.e., Karim, Louiza, and Faraj were used as local check. The genotypes
    had similar growing periods (<7 days difference in days to maturity). Detailed
    genotype/variety description has been presented in supplementary Table SI1. 2.3.
    Crop management practices Before commencing the experiment, the fields were plowed
    once using a moldboard plow in September followed by two plowings using a cultivator
    before seeding. All recommended agronomic practices for the region, except irrigation
    application, were carried out at appropriate times. A seeding density of approximately
    250 seeds m−2 was maintained using a calibrated pneumatic plot seeder for sowing
    (Wintersteiger Company). To break the continuous wheat cycle, the experimental
    area was divided into two equal parts: half of the area was allocated for treatment
    evaluation (10 genotypes x 2 seeding dates x 2 water management), and the remaining
    half of the area was allocated to homogenize the plot by seeding triticale in
    mid-December as green manure crop that was incorporated into the soil before grain
    filling in each year. In the following year, the experiment was established on
    the homogenized plot, and in the adjacent plot triticale was planted as a cover
    crop to homogenize the field. A uniform fertilizer rate of 120 kg N ha−1, 60 kg P2O5
    ha−1, and 30 kg K2O ha−1 was applied to avoid any nutrient stress as per the local
    recommended package for all growing seasons. The whole quantity of phosphorus
    and potassium was applied as a basal dose through 12:32:16 N:P:K Complex Fertilizer
    (NPK complex fertilizer 12:32:16% N:P:K) at seeding. The remaining nitrogen was
    top-dressed in two equal splits at tillering (Ammonium nitrate, 33% N) and jointing
    stage (Urea, 46% N). Weed, disease, and insect control were uniformly managed
    during the crop growing seasons. 2.4. Measurements and calculations 2.4.1. Phenology,
    yield, and yield attributes Days to emergence, anthesis, and maturity were recorded
    each year for each treatment based on whole plot observation. For harvesting,
    two border rows (each side of the plot) and 50 cm each from the top and bottom
    parts of the plots) were removed manually, and two rows of one-meter length from
    two points of each plot were harvested manually to estimate biomass weight, grain
    weight and yield attributes (total number of effective spikes, and grains per
    spike). After this, a plot combine harvester operated to harvest the remaining
    area and grain weight was recorded. Grain yield (kg ha-1) was computed from both,
    i.e., manually and machine harvested areas, and there was good agreement. For
    each plot, the final grain yield was calculated from the total grain weight of
    6 m x 2.2 m (manual and mechanically harvested) area and expressed in kg per hectare.
    To determine the number of grains per spike, 20 spikes were taken randomly, oven-dried,
    and weighed – after which the grains were separated from the spikes, weighed,
    and the number counted. Thousand kernel weight (TKW) was determined based on the
    oven-dried weight of 500 grains. Harvest index (HI) was computed from the ratio
    of oven-dried grain to total aboveground biomass. 2.4.2. Water use efficiency
    Water use efficiency was computed in terms of field-WUE (kg grain mm-1 water input
    from irrigation and rainfall) and crop-WUE (kg grain mm-1 evapotranspiration).
    In supplementary irrigated treatments, field-WUE was computed using total rainfall
    and amount of irrigation applied (total water), while in the rainfed system, it
    was computed considering total rainfall received during the crop growing period.
    Crop-WUE was computed using daily measured evapotranspiration. During the experimental
    season, daily evapotranspiration (ETo) was measured using the automated weather
    measuring device iMETOS 3.3 installed close to the research plot (within a 200 m
    distance). 2.5. Machine learning analytics Random Forest (RF) machine learning
    analytics (Breiman, 2001, Breiman and Cutler, 2012) was used to determine the
    major predictors for six major variables, i.e. grain yield, WUE, total aboveground
    biomass, spikelet density, grains per spike, and TKW for rainfed and irrigated
    systems separately. We employed the ‘randomForest’ package in R Version 4.3.1
    to identify their determinants (based on relative importance, i.e., %IncMSE metric
    – see Breiman and Cutler, 2012). Days to flowering, irrigation amount, rainfall
    (early-, mid-, and late-season), seeding time, genotype, temperature during flowering,
    and total rainfall during the crop growing period were also used as covariates.
    The measured rainfall and temperature data during the crop growing period were
    used. The RF model was trained using 80% of the data, with 20% reserved for independent
    model validation. 2.6. Statistical analysis This study evaluated 10 durum wheat
    genotypes under rainfed and supplementary irrigation (water management) systems
    with two seeding dates for four years. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed
    for yield, WUEs, major yield attributes, and water-limited yield gaps using GenStat
    21st edition. Results were presented year-wise as the year effect was significant
    for year x water management, year x seeding time, and year x varieties. Before
    conducting ANOVA, the normality distribution of the data for each year was examined
    for yield and yield attributes and WUEs using Shapiro-Wilk and Bartlet’''s homogeneity
    test. The treatment mean differences were analysed using the least significant
    difference (LSD) at p < 0.05, < 0.01, and < 0.001 levels of significance. Mean,
    standard deviation, coefficient of variation, and percentage difference were calculated
    wherever applicable. Percent contribution of different main and interaction factors
    to the overall variation in yield, total above-ground biomass production and water
    use efficiencies of the evaluated treatments was obtained by partitioning the
    ANOVA sum of squares and computing the ratio of a variation of a factor to the
    total variance and converted to percentage. Water-limited yield gaps for tested
    treatments were derived from the difference between the maximum attainable yield
    without water limitation minus the yield of each plot in the respective year (Van
    Ittersum et al., 2013). The maximum attainable yield without water limitation
    was derived by fitting an output (yield)–input (total water input) response boundary
    curve from supplementary irrigated treatment to identify the highest attainable
    yield without water limitation. Also, the random forest regression model (Breiman,
    2001, Breiman and Cutler, 2012) was used to determine the determinants of yield
    and yield attributes and WUE under rainfed and supplementary irrigation systems
    mainly using different climatic (rainfall and temperature) and management (seeding
    time, genotype, and irrigation) factors as covariate. 3. Results 3.1. Inter- and
    intra-rainfall and temperature variability during experimental years The study
    years had high inter- and intra-rainfall variability (Table 2). The seasonal rainfall
    was higher in 2018 than in 2016, 2017, and 2019. In 2016, cropping season rainfall
    was equally distributed in the early-, mid-, and late-seasons. In 2017, 94% of
    the season’s rainfall was during early- and mid-season, while the late season
    remained dry. In 2019, most of the season’s rainfall was received in the early
    season, while mid- and late- seasons received only 16% and 18%, respectively.
    In contrast, 2018 was a wet year with significant mid- and late-season rainfall.
    The average temperature during grain filling (April–May) was the lowest in 2018
    (13.9–15.9 °C), while was the highest during 2017 season (18–20.8 °C) (Table 2).

    genotype and agronomic management There was a significant year (Y), seeding time
    (SD), water management (Wm), and genotype (G) main effects for grain yield, spike
    density, grains per spike, TKW, HI, and field- and crop-WUE except for seeding
    time effects for grain yield, HI, and field-WUE (Table 3). Effects of year, water
    management, and year × seeding time accounted for 43%, 23%, and 15% of the yield
    variation in the experiment, respectively. The effect of genotype accounted for
    5.6% of variation for spike density, 5% for TKW, 3.5% for HI, and 3.1% for grains
    per spike. Significant year × seeding time, year × water management, and year
    × genotype effects were observed for almost all traits, except for year x water
    management in spike density. The year × seeding time × water management and year
    × seeding time × genotype interactions were significant only for yield and WUEs
    (both field and crop) (Table 3). Table 3. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showing

    the average yield and biomass production varied significantly with weather differences
    (year) over the study years (Table 4), with the highest yield in 2018 (7.15 t
    ha−1) followed by 2017 (4.82 t ha−1) and the lowest in 2019 (3.42 t ha−1) (Table
    5). On average, supplemental irrigation increased grain yield by more than 2.0 t
    ha−1 compared to rainfed (5.9 vs. 3.88 t ha−1), while there was no significant
    main effect of seeding time on grain yield (5.06 t ha−1 for November seeding vs.
    4.72 t ha−1 for December). On average, genotype G7 produced the highest yield
    (5.14 t ha−1) followed by G8 (5.12 t ha−1), G1 and G9 (5.07 t ha−1), and the lowest
    for G6 (4.43 t ha−1). A similar trend was observed for WUEs and yield attributes
    (Table 5). Table 4. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showing the contribution of seeding

    was a significant year × water management interaction for grain yield, biomass
    production, WUEs, and yield attributes (Table 3, Table 4). The supplementary irrigation
    increased grain yield by 2.12–3.27 t ha−1 (Fig. 3 and Table 5) and biomass by
    3.98–7.08 t ha−1, except in 2018 (Table 5) when seasonal rainfall exceeded the
    potential evapotranspiration (Fig. 4); hence the lowest number of supplementary
    irrigations was applied during this season (Table 1). The field-WUE was significantly
    affected by supplementary irrigation except in 2017 and 2018 when supplementary
    irrigation increased it by 0.77 kg mm−1 compared to the rainfed system (Table
    5). However, crop-WUE was significantly higher under supplementary irrigation
    than under rainfed also in 2017. Both field- and crop-WUE varied greatly across
    years and also genotype (except 2016 in SD1, 2016, 2017 and 2018 in SD2 for field-WUE;
    and Crop-WUE in in 2016 and 2017 on SD2 ) (Table 6). Although there was no significant
    effect of supplemental irrigation on spike density, it was higher under the supplementary
    irrigation than in rainfed systems in all years. Similarly, grains per spike and
    TKW were higher for supplementary irrigation than rainfed except in 2018 (Table
    4). Download : Download high-res image (119KB) Download : Download full-size image

    between rainfed and irrigated in respective year 3.2.2.2. Interaction effect of
    year × seeding time × water management There was a significant year × seeding
    time × water management interaction for grain yield, total aboveground biomass
    accumulation, field-WUE, and yield attributes (Table 4). In a low-rainfall year,
    grain yield increased by 1.47–3.63 t ha−1 with the application of supplementary
    irrigation under both timely and late seeding (Fig. 3). 3.2.2.3. Effect of year
    × genotype × seeding time on grain yield and field-WUE The effect of seeding time
    on grain yield was highly dependent on the rainfall distribution. Irrespective
    of other effects, the range in average grain yield of genotypes was 4.43–5.14 t
    ha−1. There was a significant year × genotype × seeding time interaction for grain
    yield and field-WUE, indicating that the effect of genotype and seeding time varied
    with rainfall amount and distribution (Table 6). In 2016, grain yield and field-WUE
    did not significantly differ among the tested genotypes for both seeding dates.
    In 2017, G1, G3, and G5 were the top three high-yielding genotypes, and G10 produced
    a low yield for early seeding, while there was no significant difference among
    the tested genotypes for late seeding. In 2018, G1, G8, and G9 were top-yielding
    genotypes for early seeding and G1, G8, and G7 were top-yielding for late seeding.
    Genotype G10 produced low yield under both early and late seeding. In 2019, G9,
    G7, and G4 were the top three high-yielding genotypes and G10 produced a low yield
    in early seeding. G7, G10, and G8 were the top three high-yielding genotypes for
    late seeding, and G4 produced the lowest yield. A similar trend for grain yield
    was observed for field-WUE (Table 6). 3.3. Water-limited yield gaps of genotypes
    With supplemental irrigation, the attainable yield gap was reduced by about 2 t
    ha−1 compared to the rainfed system (Table 7). Similarly, advancing the seeding
    time reduced the attainable yield gap by 0.35 t ha−1 compared to late seeding.
    Significant genotype and water management effects were observed for the water-limited
    attainable yield gaps. Genotype G6 showed higher yield gaps under both rainfed
    and supplemental irrigation (Fig. 6). Genotypes G7, G8, and G9 had relatively
    reduced yield gaps under both rainfed and irrigated conditions compared to other
    genotypes. Table 7. Effect of wheat genotype and seeding time (SD1- 17 November

    was the most important factor explaining variation in wheat yield followed by

    of importance. Similarly, early-season rainfall was the most important factor
    explaining variation in total biomass production followed by mid- and total-seasonal
    rainfall and temperature during flowering in the order of importance. Total-,
    early-, and mid-season rainfall were important factors explaining variation in
    spike density at harvest. Similarly, grain per spike was influenced by flowering
    temperature and mid- and total-seasonal rainfall in order of importance. In order
    of importance, the TKW was influenced by mid- and late-season rainfall and genotype.
    Similarly, mid-, late-, and total-seasonal rainfall and temperature at flowering
    in order of importance were the major determinants for field-WUE in rainfed systems.

    rainfall, days to flowering, temperature at flowering, irrigation amount applied,
    seeding time, and type of genotype used (Fig. 6). Similarly, grain yield was the

    × environment × management effect using four years of experimental data on durum
    wheat productivity and WUEs in a rainfed Mediterranean environment of Morocco.
    Significant year effect with seeding time, water management, and genotype (with
    four contrast rainfall growing seasons; Table 2) on grain yield, major yield attributes
    and WUEs indicates the need for customized seeding time, water management, and
    suitable genotype for improving wheat production with resilience. More than 7.0 t
    ha−1 yield of durum wheat in 2018 (Table 4) with the highest seasonal rainfall
    (496 mm) and lowest average yield (2.3 t ha-1) in 2019 with lowest and poorly
    distributed rainfall (Table 2) under rainfed conditions also justifies the importance
    of gowning season rainfall (mainly amount and its distribution) and accordingly
    suitable agronomic solutions for improving productivity. Also, out of four, three
    growing seasons have water stress where evapotranspiration exceeded the total
    rainfall in rainfed (Fig. 4), however application of 80–150 mm water through drip
    irrigation (Table 1) had increased grain yield by 2–3 t ha-1, indicates the need
    of demand-based supplementary irrigation for stable yield in such variable climatic
    condition. The machine learning analysis also showed that the amount of rainfall
    and flowering time temperature remained major factors determining yield and WUE
    (Fig. 5). In Morocco, ∼85% of the wheat area is under rainfed with an average
    productivity of 1.85 + 0.63 t ha-1 (recent 10 years, i.e., 2012–2021 average productivity)
    (FAOSTAT, 2023). The average productivity under farmers’ management can be increased
    by 1.5 t ha-1 (considering at least 50% of the productivity achieved in the experimental
    station in our study) if the provision of supplementary irrigation in extreme
    drought conditions is available. From the analysis of the recent 10 years (2012–2021)
    FAOSTAT data, on average, Morocco is importing 44% of wheat grain (4.30 +1.09
    MT year-1) to fulfill the country''s need. Considering this scenario (average
    yield increment of 1.5 t ha-1), if there is the provision of supplementary irrigation
    in 1 M ha, total annual wheat production in the country can be increased by 23%
    and reduced the import by 35%. The significant year × seeding time (Table 3) indicates
    the effect of seeding time varies across year as a proxy of rainfall distribution
    and amount. Our yearly variance decomposition analysis found the contribution
    of seeding time (to the total variance) ranged from 14% to 41% for grain yield,
    8–35% for total aboveground biomass, and 10–61% for crop-WUE (derived from Table
    4). Also, the significant seeding time × water management effect justifies the
    effect of seeding time varies with water availability (either through rainfall
    or supplemental irrigation). Compared to 2016 and 2017, the lowest yield under
    rainfed conditions in 2019 (2.36 t ha−1; Table 5), where 197 mm (66%) of total
    rainfall occurred during the early season (Table 2) and distribution was poor.
    Majority of the wheat yield variability in rainfed conditions can be explained
    by crop growth rate (Balaghi et al., 2008), total seasonal rainfall and rainfall
    during the critical growth stages (Latiri et al., 2010), and previous crop, residual
    soil moisture, and genotype resilience to rainfall variability (Devkota et al.,
    2022a). The significant year × seeding time effect (Table 3), especially the higher
    yield in 2017 and 2019 for rainfed conditions under SD1, while the higher yield
    under SD2 in 2016 (>3 t ha−1) with the lowest seasonal rainfall (256 mm), shows
    that seeding time need to be adjusted according to rainfall variability. Our study
    found that early seeding with supplemental irrigation can provide a more stable
    yield, where SD1 with supplemental irrigation had yield variability (coefficient
    of variation, CV) of 17% compared to 50% under rainfed; and SD2 had CV of 34%
    with supplementary irrigation and CV of 60% under rainfed). However, more than
    1.0 t ha-1 higher yield under SD2 (29 December seeding) than under 17 November
    (SD1) in 2018 (good rainfall year) indicates higher yield (>7.0 t ha-1) can be
    obtained even if seeding by the end of December in the year with well-distributed
    rainfall and cool temperature during flowering and grain filling (Table 2). Also,
    rainfall just before and during the early grain-filling period is critical for
    higher yields (Heng et al., 2007). Under the drier conditions with late seeding,
    higher temperatures shortened crop growth duration and grain filling period, accelerated
    leaf senescence, and reduced grain setting, thus reduced yield. In our study,
    late planting reduced aboveground biomass accumulation, spikelet density, grains
    per spike, and TKW. This finding is consistent with the results of Rezzouk et
    al. (2022) for durum wheat in the Mediterranean climatic condition of Spain. Thus,
    in drylands, customized seeding time based on weather forecasting (considering
    rainfall amount, rainfall frequency, and temperature) can maximize the effective
    use of available water, which leads to improved crop productivity and resilience.
    Similarly, yield performance and WUEs varied due to main effects of water management
    and genotype and its interaction with year (Table 3, Table 7; Fig. 3). This result
    has been supported by the results of machine learning (Fig. 4, Fig. 5); where
    year/rainfall/supplementary irrigation interactions accounted for the highest
    contribution to grain yield and WUEs. Out of four, three growing seasons received
    below-average rainfall and the application of supplemental irrigation in low rainfall
    years increased grain yield by > 3.0 t ha-1 (Table 6). Also, analysis of variance
    decomposition showed the contribution of supplemental irrigation ranged from 0.5%
    (in wet year 2018) to 76% (in the dry year 2016, where seasonal rainfall was 256 mm).
    As expected, application of supplemental irrigation reduced the water-limited
    yield gaps (Table 8) and improved WUEs (Table 6) compared to rainfed, further
    justifies that availability of supplemental irrigation or rainfall amount is the
    major determinant of wheat yield. Consistent with this finding, significant effects
    of supplemental irrigation in increasing yields of durum wheat and other crops
    (bread wheat, faba bean, chickpea, and lentil) under rainfed conditions were reported
    in the dry Mediterranean region of Syria (Karrou, 2013, Karrou and Oweis, 2012).
    However, with declining water availability, water for supplemental irrigation
    may not be available in such rainfed drylands. Also, with the climate change patterns
    in the Mediterranean region, frequency of occurrence of drought is increasing
    in recent years and will be more severe in the future (Lange, 2020). Hence it
    is important to develop integrated climate-smart crop management practices considering
    season’s rainfall and availability of supplemental irrigation. Table 8. Interaction

    in SI1 The significant genotype × water management interaction in yield and yield
    attributes indicated that expression of plant traits such as total aboveground
    biomass accumulation, spikelet density, HI, grains per spike, and TKW (Table 6),
    which actively contribute to yield, are affected by efficient water management.
    Genotypes G7 followed by G8 consistently performed better in both rainfed and
    irrigated environments across the year and low water-limited yield gaps. This
    suggests that selection of varietal traits that increase yield and field-WUE under
    favorable and low moisture conditions is important for such variable rainfed drylands
    (Yu et al., 2021). Our result showed that the contribution of genotypes in the
    total yield variance was highest (38%) in the wet year (2018) and the lowest in
    the driest year (0.6%) (Table 4). This result indicates the tested genotypes have
    higher yield gain under favorable conditions and demands for developing suitable
    drought-tolerant varieties for variable weather and low rainfall environments.
    However, the contribution of genotype cannot be underestimated as genotype potential
    is suppressed by climatic and management factors (stresses) and water plays a
    major role, while in irrigated conditions, the current genotypes can express their
    full potential (Ojeda et al., 2022, Ojeda et al., 2021). Comparatively low contribution
    of genotype in our experiment could be genotypes were bred under favorable environments.
    A focused special breeding program considering traits like drought tolerance,
    short duration, extensive root growth, deeper root system, good branching, dwarf
    plants with less but erect leaves, moderate tillering, resistance to pests and
    diseases, and efficient photosynthetic system might increase yield with resilience
    in the rainfed Mediterranean region (Farooq et al., 2009). In dry Mediterranean
    environments, genotypes characterized by yield traits such as long coleoptile
    length (benefits under deep seeding conditions and early ground cover; Spielmeyer
    et al., 2007), long grain-filling period, high tillering, and heat and water stress
    tolerance could be useful traits to guarantee good yield (Mwadzingeni et al.,
    2016). A few genotypes consistently produced higher yields under both rainfed
    and irrigated systems (Table 8); however, the interannual variation in rainfall
    and temperature altered genotype performance under the rainfed system. In this
    study, supplementary irrigation improved the biomass (+35%), HI (+11%), spike
    density (+19%), grains per spike (+16%), TKW (+16%), field-WUE (+16%), and crop-WUE
    (+40%) (Table 4), where 28–166 mm of supplemental irrigation was applied (depending
    on rainfall amounts) (Table 1). Even with late planting conditions, irrigation
    helped to improve yield attributes, mostly by providing soil moisture and reducing
    canopy temperature (Amani et al., 1996). The experimental results are supported
    by the results of machine learning, where in both irrigated and rainfed systems,
    the magnitude of the effect of different climates (rainfall and temperature) followed
    by management (seeding time, genotype, and irrigation) were the major determinants
    of yield, yield attributes, and WUEs. The random forest model result (Fig. 5,
    Fig. 6) showed total rainfall was the most important factor explaining variation
    in rainfed wheat yield, followed by the temperature at flowering, mid- and early-season
    rainfall, and genotype in order of importance. For yield and major yield attributes,
    seasonal rainfall remained the most important factor explaining variation in grain
    yield followed by early-season rainfall, days to flowering, temperature at flowering,
    irrigation amount, seeding time, and genotype in irrigated durum wheat. The early
    season rainfall remained a major factor determining total biomass production and
    spike density in wheat production. In a mixed crop-livestock system, biomass production
    is equally important as grain yield, hence it is important to consider genotype
    and management practices that help to improve grain yield and biomass production
    in rainfed drylands. Similarly, with supplemental irrigation, the amount of rainfall,
    days to flowering and temperature during flowering were observed as important
    factors determining grain yield, field-WUE, spike density, grains per spike, and
    TKW. This showed that varieties with a longer vegetative growing period, heat
    and drought tolerant character are important for improving crop productivity and
    quality of durum wheat in Mediterranean drylands in Morocco. ''Dry soils are as
    hungry as they are thirsty’, hence fertilizer management is also an important
    factor to improve productivity and WUE with resilience (Bouabid et al., 2020).
    Under the condition of low moisture, many nutrient elements are less mobile even
    if available in the soil and the management varies based on the soil moisture,
    site, and year (climate) (Savin et al., 2022). However, this study lacks an interaction
    of fertilizer management with seeding time, water management and genotype, therefore
    further study is suggested to understand the contribution of fertilizer management
    and its interactions for improving wheat productivity in such climatic conditions.
    5. Conclusions Crop production in the rainfed drylands of Morocco is constrained
    by inadequate and often erratic rainfall, variable temperature, and the lack of
    context-specific management practices. This study aimed to understand major factors
    determining wheat yield and water use efficiency; and how wheat genotypes can
    be combined with agronomic management such as seeding time and water management
    for improving crop yield and water use efficiency in the Mediterranean climate
    of Morocco. Water management (rainfall amount) was a major yield-determining factor
    in rainfed drylands, advancing seeding time coupled with suitable genotype reduced
    water-limited yield gaps. In the context of declining water availability, precision
    use of available water helps to increase the area under supplemental irrigation
    for improving the productivity and resilience of wheat production in the Mediterranean
    climate in Morocco. The significant year × seeding time, year × water management,
    year × genotype, and year × genotype × seeding time interactions clearly indicated
    that a single and static solution does not work in drylands, and requires dynamic
    climate prediction, climate-smart technology adoption, and policy support. Advancing
    the seeding time improves crop yield and water use efficiency as it better utilizes
    the season’s rainfall. Better choice of resilient varieties, efficient use of
    available water through the application of supplemental irrigation, and adjustment
    of sowing time are among the key factors with the potential to combat adverse
    production conditions. Hence, the genotype with drought- and heat-stress tolerant
    traits coupled with the site- and soil-specific customized bundled agronomic solutions
    are needed to improve the resilience and sustainability of wheat production in
    the Mediterranean rainfed drylands of Morocco and similar production environment
    in the MENA region. CRediT authorship contribution statement Mina Devkota: Conceptualization,

  data_sources: Data from 120 intensive wheat production systems in north-western
    India
  description: An accurate, timely and large-scale yield prediction is considered
    critically important to frame policies to mitigate climate change risks and for
    ensured food security. Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), being a major cereal grain
    crop of north-western India, has been highly energy intensive with large emissions
    of greenhouse gases, affecting ecosystems’ sustainability. We therefore, performed
    energy optimization in wheat for enhanced ecosystems’ resilience and carbon (C)
    sustainability, while predicting yields of 120 intensive wheat production systems
    across north-western India. An integrated approach of data envelopment analysis
    (DEA) and machine learning (ML) models was applied for energy optimization and
    accurate yield prediction. After optimization of energy input in wheat production,
    8 different ML models of variable complexity viz. linear regression (LR), ridge
    regression (RR), lasso regression (LAR), elastic net regression (ENR), decision
    tree regression (DT), random forest regression (RF), gradient boosting regression
    (GB) and support vector regression (SVR) were applied and evaluated statistically
    for accurate prediction of wheat yields of studied decision making units (DMUs).
    These results revealed that wheat ecosystems have a high total input energy (EI)
    of 24.7 GJ ha−1, which comprises ~46.5% share of direct and 53.5% of indirect
    energy sources. The non-renewable energy input was ~3.9 times higher than the
    renewable energy. The total C equivalent emissions of 1815.7 kg CO2e ha−1 comprised
    the highest share of chemical fertilizers (~49.8%), and exhibited a linear significant
    relationship with EI (R2 = 0.8117**; p < 0.01). Nitrogenous fertilizers application
    contributes ~90.1% towards total fertilizer related energy input in wheat production.
    The net global warming potential of 2.30 Mg CO2e ha−1 yr−1 was estimated which
    resulted in yield scaled emissions (i.e., greenhouse gases intensity) of 0.34
    kg CO2e kg−1 wheat grain yield. The DEA-based benchmarking showed that the technical
    efficiency (TE) score of 79 DMUs was < 1.00, elucidated ~65% DMUs as energy inefficient.
    The average (n = 120) TE score of 0.92 illustrates energy saving possibility of
    2464.6 MJ ha−1 (~8% of EI), mostly via efficient fertilizer (54.4%) and irrigation
    water management (11.6%). The 1:1 (x = y) correspondence analysis implies that
    DT, GB, and RF models can accurately predict wheat productivity with significantly
    higher R2 values of 0.998** (p < 0.01), 0.950** (p < 0.01), and 0.832* (p < 0.05),
    respectively. These results underpin overwhelming significance of DEA-based energy
    optimization for wheat ecosystems, which helps reduce the energy and C footprints
    for sustainable and cleaner production. Nonetheless, DT, GB, and RF models outperformed
    in yield prediction with the lowest root mean square error and normalized mean
    square error, but the highest Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency and index of agreement.
    Therefore, DEA-based benchmarking has significant energy saving potential, while
    DT, GB, and RF models have highly accurate wheat yield prediction abilities for
    north-western India.

  explanation: The study was conducted to investigate the integration of Data Envelopment
    Analysis (DEA) and machine learning approaches to optimize energy use, reduce
    carbon footprints, and predict wheat yield across north-western India. A total
    of 120 intensive wheat production systems were analyzed, and the results indicated
    that there is a high total input energy of 24.7 GJ ha-1, approximately 46.5% direct
    and 53.5% indirect energy sources. The study found that DEA-based energy optimization
    has significant potential for energy saving, with the potential to reduce technical
    inefficiency in 65% of the farms studied. Additionally, machine learning models,
    specifically decision tree regression (DT), random forest regression (RF), and
    support vector regression (SVR), outperformed in yield prediction with the lowest
    root mean square error and normalized mean square error but obtained the highest
    Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency and index of agreement. Hence, the study suggests that
    the integration of DEA and machine learning approaches can effectively optimize
    energy use, reduce carbon footprints, and predict wheat yield, contributing to
    sustainable and resilient wheat production systems.

    timely and large-scale yield prediction is considered critically important to
    frame policies to mitigate climate change risks and for ensured food security.
    Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), being a major cereal grain crop of north-western
    India, has been highly energy intensive with large emissions of greenhouse gases,
    affecting ecosystems’ sustainability. We therefore, performed energy optimization
    in wheat for enhanced ecosystems’ resilience and carbon (C) sustainability, while
    predicting yields of 120 intensive wheat production systems across north-western
    India. An integrated approach of data envelopment analysis (DEA) and machine learning
    (ML) models was applied for energy optimization and accurate yield prediction.
    After optimization of energy input in wheat production, 8 different ML models
    of variable complexity viz. linear regression (LR), ridge regression (RR), lasso
    regression (LAR), elastic net regression (ENR), decision tree regression (DT),
    random forest regression (RF), gradient boosting regression (GB) and support vector
    regression (SVR) were applied and evaluated statistically for accurate prediction
    of wheat yields of studied decision making units (DMUs). These results revealed
    that wheat ecosystems have a high total input energy (EI) of 24.7 GJ ha−1, which
    comprises ~46.5% share of direct and 53.5% of indirect energy sources. The non-renewable
    energy input was ~3.9 times higher than the renewable energy. The total C equivalent
    emissions of 1815.7 kg CO2e ha−1 comprised the highest share of chemical fertilizers
    (~49.8%), and exhibited a linear significant relationship with EI (R2 = 0.8117**;
    p < 0.01). Nitrogenous fertilizers application contributes ~90.1% towards total
    fertilizer related energy input in wheat production. The net global warming potential
    of 2.30 Mg CO2e ha−1 yr−1 was estimated which resulted in yield scaled emissions
    (i.e., greenhouse gases intensity) of 0.34 kg CO2e kg−1 wheat grain yield. The
    DEA-based benchmarking showed that the technical efficiency (TE) score of 79 DMUs
    was < 1.00, elucidated ~65% DMUs as energy inefficient. The average (n = 120)
    TE score of 0.92 illustrates energy saving possibility of 2464.6 MJ ha−1 (~8%
    of EI), mostly via efficient fertilizer (54.4%) and irrigation water management
    (11.6%). The 1:1 (x = y) correspondence analysis implies that DT, GB, and RF models
    can accurately predict wheat productivity with significantly higher R2 values
    of 0.998** (p < 0.01), 0.950** (p < 0.01), and 0.832* (p < 0.05), respectively.
    These results underpin overwhelming significance of DEA-based energy optimization
    for wheat ecosystems, which helps reduce the energy and C footprints for sustainable
    and cleaner production. Nonetheless, DT, GB, and RF models outperformed in yield
    prediction with the lowest root mean square error and normalized mean square error,
    but the highest Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency and index of agreement. Therefore, DEA-based
    benchmarking has significant energy saving potential, while DT, GB, and RF models
    have highly accurate wheat yield prediction abilities for north-western India.

  data_sources: Monthly precipitation gauge data from 18 meteorological stations located
    in the Upper Euphrates basin, Turkey
  description: The design of optimal precipitation station configuration (network)
    is pivotal for obtaining accurate spatiotemporal data in a cost-efficient manner
    in terms of high operation, management and maintenance costs of stations, and
    missing data completion. In the present study, historical spatiotemporal precipitation
    data of 18 stations located in the Upper Euphrates watershed basin are initially
    exposed to empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis to exploit the general
    intrinsic low dimensionality of the precipitation phenomenon. Along with the basic
    EOF analysis, robust and mean-centered versions are also developed to improve
    the prediction accuracy of spatiotemporal precipitation data and optimize the
    number of stations in the watershed basin. Importantly, for the first time, robust
    EOF (R-EOF) analysis has been carried out in a hydrological predictive study.
    The matrix that contains the obtained modes (EOFs) is fed into the QR factorization
    with a column pivoting algorithm and sparse precipitation gauge locations are
    identified. The assessment of the model using the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of
    efficiency (CE), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE)
    metrics reveals that the complete dimensional state space can be reconstructed
    effectively, and its future evolution can be predicted accurately even with a
    small number of observation stations. Remarkably, the spatiotemporal precipitation
    data for the entire field can be reconstructed using only four, five, 10, or 12
    stations, utilizing robust mean-centered (R-MC-EOF), robust (R-EOF), mean-centered
    (MC-EOF), and standalone EOF models. These models demonstrate high performance
    with CE values of 0.96, 0.94, 0.84, and 0.81 and RMSE values of 2.2, 3.8, 5.7,
    and 6.8 mm, respectively. Notably, both the R-EOF and MC-EOF models outperformed
    their standalone counterparts in terms of model performance. When a sufficient
    amount of spatiotemporal data is available, the optimal number and locations of
    precipitation gauges can be easily determined using the QR with a column pivoting
    algorithm. This algorithm is user friendly and can be implemented in popular programming
    environments such as Python, MATLAB, and R. Due to the limited budgets and/or
    low accessibility conditions, challenging basin topography, and bad weather conditions,
    not many areas are extensively equipped with instruments to measure the precipitation;
    thus, high-resolution data is not always available. Acquiring reliable and accurate
    data is critical for water resources management, flood and drought warning, irrigation
    networks, hydrological (e.g., watershed, rain-runoff) modeling, and urban and
    environmental planning. This renders the proposed methodology very crucial in
    obtaining high-fidelity spatiotemporal data.

  explanation: This paper presents a novel approach for optimizing the placement of
    automated precipitation monitoring stations within a watershed basin. The approach
    combines Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis with QR decomposition with
    column pivoting to identify the most informative locations for precipitation measurements.
    EOF analysis extracts the dominant spatial patterns and temporal variations in
    the precipitation data, while QR decomposition with column pivoting is used to
    determine the optimal locations for precipitation gauges based on the EOF-derived
    patterns.
  extract_1: '"Optimum station intervals are identified. Altunkaynak (2005) further
    proposed the trigonometric point cumulative semivariogram (TPCSV) concept over
    point cumulative semivariogram (PCSV) in order to enable the determination of
    the influence radius of a regional variable, which cannot be obtained from the
    traditional Kriging approach."'
  extract_2: '"In other words, full spatial-temporal network precipitation will be
    approximated via only an optimally selected number of precipitation station data."'

    configuration (network) is pivotal for obtaining accurate spatiotemporal data
    in a cost-efficient manner in terms of high operation, management and maintenance
    costs of stations, and missing data completion. In the present study, historical
    spatiotemporal precipitation data of 18 stations located in the Upper Euphrates
    watershed basin are initially exposed to empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis
    to exploit the general intrinsic low dimensionality of the precipitation phenomenon.
    Along with the basic EOF analysis, robust and mean-centered versions are also
    developed to improve the prediction accuracy of spatiotemporal precipitation data
    and optimize the number of stations in the watershed basin. Importantly, for the
    first time, robust EOF (R-EOF) analysis has been carried out in a hydrological
    predictive study. The matrix that contains the obtained modes (EOFs) is fed into
    the QR factorization with a column pivoting algorithm and sparse precipitation
    gauge locations are identified. The assessment of the model using the Nash–Sutcliffe
    coefficient of efficiency (CE), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute
    error (MAE) metrics reveals that the complete dimensional state space can be reconstructed
    effectively, and its future evolution can be predicted accurately even with a
    small number of observation stations. Remarkably, the spatiotemporal precipitation
    data for the entire field can be reconstructed using only four, five, 10, or 12
    stations, utilizing robust mean-centered (R-MC-EOF), robust (R-EOF), mean-centered
    (MC-EOF), and standalone EOF models. These models demonstrate high performance
    with CE values of 0.96, 0.94, 0.84, and 0.81 and RMSE values of 2.2, 3.8, 5.7,
    and 6.8 mm, respectively. Notably, both the R-EOF and MC-EOF models outperformed
    their standalone counterparts in terms of model performance. When a sufficient
    amount of spatiotemporal data is available, the optimal number and locations of
    precipitation gauges can be easily determined using the QR with a column pivoting
    algorithm. This algorithm is user friendly and can be implemented in popular programming
    environments such as Python, MATLAB, and R. Due to the limited budgets and/or
    low accessibility conditions, challenging basin topography, and bad weather conditions,
    not many areas are extensively equipped with instruments to measure the precipitation;
    thus, high-resolution data is not always available. Acquiring reliable and accurate
    data is critical for water resources management, flood and drought warning, irrigation
    networks, hydrological (e.g., watershed, rain-runoff) modeling, and urban and
    environmental planning. This renders the proposed methodology very crucial in
    obtaining high-fidelity spatiotemporal data. Introduction Precipitation is of
    paramount importance in the hydrological cycle of Earth. Acquiring reliable data
    that are representative of regional precipitation is critical for water resources
    management, flood and drought warning, irrigation networks, hydrological (e.g.,
    watershed, rain-runoff) modeling, and urban and environmental planning (Saeidfarzad
    et al. 2014; Bayat et al. 2021; Altunkaynak 2019). Traditional precipitation gauges
    are physical devices to obtain accurate rainfall measurements that are further
    used for calibration of satellite rainfall estimation algorithms (Mishra 2009)
    and validation of numerical models (Dai et al. 2017). Precipitation is a multiscale
    and spatiotemporal phenomenon with high variability. A precipitation network (stations),
    therefore, has to be optimally designed to extract spatial coherent structures
    (patterns) of the local watershed basin and their associated temporal evolutions.
    This requires, in general, accessing sufficient high-quality precipitation data
    of a region. Accordingly, the geographic locations of measurement stations have
    to be dense enough to enable accurate and reliable interpolation of the precipitation
    data. In many cases, however, due to budget constraints, terrain limitations,
    and inaccessibility, installing the required number of observation stations is
    not possible. Moreover, existing precipitation stations are being closed due to
    the high operation and maintenance costs, for instance, the number of rain gauges
    in Europe, South Africa, and Africa is reported to have reduced by 50% (Mishra
    2009; Lorenz and Kunstmann 2012; Dai et al. 2017). Therefore, even though the
    spatial distribution of the stations is sparse, their locations have to be optimized
    so that, maximum information with minimum redundancy has to be cost-effectively
    extracted. To this end, Altunkaynak and Özger (2005) developed a standard regional
    dependence function (SRDF) based on useful contents of the semivariogram. By using
    SRDF, unmeasured values of variables in a station are approximated from data of
    the closest stations, and optimum station intervals are identified. Altunkaynak
    (2005) further proposed the trigonometric point cumulative semivariogram (TPCSV)
    concept over point cumulative semivariogram (PCSV) in order to enable the determination
    of the influence radius of a regional variable, which cannot be obtained from
    the traditional Kriging approach. In a later study, Altunkaynak (2008) further
    advocated a methodology called slope regional dependency function (Slope-RDF)
    to improve the accuracy of the radius of influence determination, missing data
    completion, and identifying the optimal locations of measurement sites. Altunkaynak
    (2009) compared two geostatistical models, i.e., slope point semivariogram (Slope-PSV)
    and point cumulative semivariogram (PCSV) to measure their ability to accurately
    obtain the value of the regional variable. He found that the relative error of
    Slope-PSV was below 5%, whereas the error of the PCSV method was approximately
    10%. Altunkaynak (2015) further developed a slope point cumulative semivariogram
    (Slope-PCSV) approach to develop a regional dependency function and address the
    limitations of traditional geostatistical methods. The Slope-PCSV approach is
    found superior to other methodologies in spatial analysis. Table 1. General information

    1,429 37.57 28.69 Particularly for regional variables, i.e., precipitation, several
    approaches for optimal network design are proposed. Aziz et al. (2016) introduced
    a hybrid model by combining the geostatistics variance–reduction method with a
    particle swarm optimization routine to select the locations of rain gauges for
    optimal design network. They addressed that the identified positions of the rain
    gauges yield a minimum value of estimated variance. Wang et al. (2017) proposed
    a time-continuous maximal covering location problem (TMLCP) model taking into
    consideration both ground-based measurements and remote sensing data. The results
    indicated that precipitation station configuration is effectively optimized via
    the introduced model. Bayat et al. (2021) leveraged the ability of fuzzy logic
    in describing nonlinear and random precipitation phenomena and attempted to optimize
    the locations of the rain gauges via fuzzy standard inverse distance (FS-IDW)
    and fuzzy modified standard inverse distance (FM-IDW) methods. Both developed
    models are found superior to ordinary Kriging methods; however, among both fuzzy
    models, FM-IDW provided better results. Wang et al. (2020) utilized the elitist
    nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) technique for the optimal design
    of a precipitation station network. The algorithm provided a set of Pareto-efficient
    solutions. The model is tested in a river basin, and results showed that the introduced
    method is satisfactory in establishing higher coverage than the present real-world
    deployment. Mishra (2009) provides a detailed survey of the methodologies for
    optimizing the precipitation station configuration. Mishra (2009) further highlighted
    the fact that the demand for hydrometric information will increase in the future;
    however, there still exists information gaps and much to be accomplished to reach
    optimal network design protocols. Empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis
    is a data factorization algorithm based on the correlation patterns in data. Real-world
    data generated by physical natural processes are generically high dimensional;
    however, despite high dimensionality, natural phenomena can mostly be described
    by a few coherent modes (Kutz 2013). Empirical orthogonal function analysis leverages
    this fact and, as a data-driven approach, decomposes spatial time series data
    into its spatial coherent patterns (EOFs or modes) along with the associated time
    evolutions in a hierarchical fashion based on the L 2 energy norm. Accordingly,
    the first mode is the most correlated spatial feature in the data, the second
    mode is the second most correlated structure, and so on. Furthermore, modes generated
    by EOF decomposition are mutually orthogonal. EOF analysis has several different
    names depending on the scientific field it is used, such as principal component
    analysis (PCA) in statistics, proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) in fluid mechanics,
    and Karhunen–Loeve (KL) expansion in stochastic processes. In EOF analysis a spatiotemporal
    data matrix is decomposed into its simpler subseries (components) in an energy-based
    (minimum least squares norm) hierarchical fashion in the sense that the first
    component explains the most information (variance) present in data. Subsequently,
    this process continues until all information is extracted. A powerful singular
    value decomposition tool from linear algebra is at the heart of the EOF analysis
    and provides a convenient and stable means for its numerical implementation. The
    analysis begins with organizing the spatiotemporal data into a matrix in both
    space and time directions (columns and rows, respectively). At a particular time,
    distributed spatial data values are collected in a column vector that is called
    a state space vector. Note that a state space vector measured at time t is also
    called a snapshot vector. Accordingly, in order to efficiently and economically
    obtain precipitation data from the minimum number of stations, in this contribution,
    the number of precipitation stations in the Upper Euphrates basin, Turkey, is
    optimized via discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM) with column pivoting
    QR factorization on a data-driven EOF basis. DEIM, which is an improved version
    of the empirical interpolation method (EIM), is heavily used in selecting optimal
    points of a nonlinear function, forming a low-dimensional substitute in reduced-order
    modeling (Brunton and Kutz 2019). After the sampling process, the low-dimensional
    nonlinear function is interpolated to full state. In the Q-DEIM (DEIM with QR)
    framework, sparse sampling is performed via QR decomposition with column pivoting,
    that is, given precipitation network data, this study utilizes QR factorization
    on a data-driven basis identified by EOF analysis and its variants in reconstructing
    state space of precipitation network. Pivot locations obtained from QR factorization
    correspond to physical station locations in the watershed basin. In other words,
    full spatial-temporal network precipitation will be approximated via only an optimally
    selected number of precipitation station data. This approach has not been used
    in the optimal network design of any hydrological variable. For the first time,
    in this study, the EOF analysis combined with QR decomposition with column pivoting
    will be used for optimal precipitation configuration in a watershed. To this end,
    the objectives of the present study are to (1) obtain a data-driven basis from
    historical measured data to represent the spatiotemporal precipitation of the
    Upper Euphrates watershed basin via basic, mean-centered, robust, and mean-centered
    empirical orthogonal function analysis, (2) apply QR factorization with column
    pivoting numerical scheme to data-driven EOF basis and determine the pivot locations
    that correspond to physical measurement (station) locations for each total number
    of stations, (3) reconstruct and predict the full-dimensional state space precipitation
    data of the whole Upper Euphrates basin for each total station number, (4) evaluate
    the performances of the models with diagnostic error metrics (root mean square
    error (RMSE), [Nash and Sutcliffe (1970), and mean absolute error (MAE)] and real-world
    deployment data to identify the developed model that best reconstructs and predicts
    the measured spatiotemporal precipitation data, and (5) obtain the optimum precipitation
    network configuration which extracts utmost information from the smallest number
    of stations. Materials and Methods Study Area and Data Collection The precipitation
    stations, from which data are acquired in the present study, are located in the
    Upper Euphrates basin that forms the west part of the Eastern Anatolia Region
    of Turkey with coordinates between 39.0958 N and 40.5577 E. Upper Euphrates has
    mountainous terrain with large tectonic plains. Fig. 1 is the geographic map of
    the region. The watershed climate is characterized by wet winters and dry summers
    which belong to the subtropical Mediterranean climate (Balov and Altunkaynak 2020).
    Precipitation occurs largely in October to April mostly in the form of snow on
    the uplands (Yürekli 2015). Most precipitation occurs in spring with 62% of the
    total yearly precipitation, followed by winter and summer with 33% and 5% of the
    total, respectively. However, as terrain changes from mountains to plains from
    west to east, the seasonal distribution of the precipitation varies. The precipitation
    percentage of the winter season is larger than that of the spring season when
    the mountainous terrain surrounding the region is considered. General information
    and statistical summary of observation stations used in this study are presented
    in Table 1. Fig. 1. Geographic map of the Upper Euphrates basin and location of
    the stations. (Map data © 2024 Google.) Monthly precipitation gauge data is obtained
    for the time span 1980 to 2010 from 18 meteorological stations located in the
    Upper Euphrates basin. Fig. 1 shows the geographic locations of the monitoring
    stations. Each station has an identification number. The highest and lowest station
    altitudes are 1,490 m and 808 m, respectively. For each observation station, the
    historical time series is composed of 372 monthly measurements of total precipitation.
    In the basin, maximum and minimum monthly precipitation measurement values are
    30.71 and 80.44 mm, respectively. Gauges used for measuring precipitation are
    weighing-type pluvio meters that only measure precipitation. An isoline map showing
    the means of the 31 years of data is presented in Fig. 2. Fig. 2. Isoline map
    that shows the means of the 31 years of data. In the present study, first, 70%
    of spatiotemporal data (260-time measurements of 18 spatial points) are utilized
    for the training phase, and the remaining 30% of the data (112-time measurements
    of 18 spatial points) are used for validation of the model. Fig. 3 indicates a
    representative precipitation time series plot of station 17776 along with training
    and validation partitions. Fig. 3. Historical time series of station 17776 along
    with training and validation partitions. Empirical Orthogonal Function Analysis
    In this study, a state space vector is composed of 18 components ( d i ϵ R 18
    ) that are constructed via precipitation data obtained from 18 different stations
    at a particular time t. Since there are 372 temporal measurements in the regional
    data points, there are also 372 snapshots in the data matrix. Fig. 4 shows the
    schematic of an organized data matrix D for EOF analysis, where D ϵ R nxm is the
    data matrix, d i ϵ R n is the state vector (snapshot) at time index i, and t j
    ϵ R m is the jth time series of a state variable (precipitation of a particular
    station in our case) of the system. Column-wise and row-wise appearance of a matrix
    is viewing the same information from different points of view. Importantly, in
    this study, the number of rows of the data matrix is smaller than that of the
    column number (the data matrix is short and fat). In the column-oriented approach,
    snapshots are aligned temporally in a sequential fashion, while rows correspond
    to a time series of a particular state if the matrix is row-wise considered. Note
    that since the data is arranged into a rectangular matrix, the maximum rank is
    the minimum of n and m. Accordingly, reduced singular value decomposition of data
    matrix D yields D = Ψ Σ Θ T (1) where Ψ ϵ R nxn = orthogonal matrix that has empirical
    orthogonal functions (modes) in its columns; Σ ϵ R nxn = diagonal matrix with
    singular values in its diagonal; and Θ ϵ R mxn = orthogonal matrix that provides
    time evolutions of EOFs in its columns; and T = transpose operator. Importantly,
    entries of the data matrix in this study are strictly real numbers; therefore,
    all output matrices of singular value decomposition (SVD) procedure are real valued.
    However, SVD is more general, as the data matrix can also be complex valued (in
    that case, transpose is a complex conjugate operator). Singular values in the
    diagonal of Σ are positive numbers sorted in descending order. This special property
    of Σ implies that since EOFs are unit length (orthonormal), EOFs (modes) are also
    sorted in Ψ matrix according to their importance in the sense that the first mode
    represents the most correlated spatial pattern among the state space vectors in
    D (note that the dimensions of the EOFs and the state vectors are the same). As
    such, the second mode is the second most correlated pattern in the data matrix,
    and so on. Fig. 4. Schematic of the column and row-wise organization of the data
    matrix D . Now, the key observation is that Ψ provides an orthogonal set of bases
    (EOFs) for the column space of D and thus time evolution of the state vector d
    may be approximated via the linear combination of a sufficiently large number
    of EOFs d = Ψ r a (2) where r = number of modes used in the construction of d
    and a contains the weightings of the linear combination of R-EOF modes in matrix
    Ψ r ϵ R nxr (r = min(n,m)). This statement is intuitive and makes sense because
    even though most dynamical phenomena in nature are high dimensional, they evolve
    on a low feature space (Kutz 2013). In other words, the SVD of the data matrix
    D yields hierarchically ordered data-driven basis vectors for the reconstruction
    of d . For instance, if a state of the system is high dimensional yet the dynamics
    have a relatively low number of coherent structures (EOFs) that describe the time
    evolution of the system, only a few modes are sufficient for accurate approximation
    of the original high dimensional system. If the state of a system is measured
    at limited spatial locations, only a partial knowledge of the system is obtained
    s = M d (3) where M ϵ R rxn = measurement matrix; and s = low-dimensional state
    representation of d . In general, Bernoulli, Gaussian, single-pixel, or sparse
    random sampling matrices are used for measurements; however, single-pixel point
    measurements are often preferred for applications where individual measurements
    are expensive (Manohar et al. 2018). Fig. 5 illustrates a schematic of the sampling
    process via a single-pixel point measurement matrix. Importantly, note that active
    (nonzero) terms in M are unity with which corresponding entries of d are selected.
    Fig. 5. Schematic of the sampling process. Substituting d in Eq. (2) into Eq.
    (3) yields s = M Ψ r a (4) and a may be approximated with the following formula
    a = ( M Ψ r ) − 1 s (5) In order to accurately evaluate Eq. (5), the matrix M
    Ψ r should not be ill-conditioned. The condition number of a matrix is the ratio
    of the largest singular value to the smallest singular value. The value of the
    condition number is a proxy measure for the invertibility of a matrix. The smallest
    number that a condition number can take is 1 (for identity matrix) corresponding
    to utmost invertibility. However, for very large values of the condition number,
    the related matrix becomes ill-conditioned and its inverse becomes highly susceptible.
    Thereby, M should be chosen so that the condition number of M Ψ r is relatively
    low. QR factorization with column pivoting is an algorithm that decomposes a generic
    matrix A ϵ R nxm as follows: A P T = Q R (6) where Q ϵ R nxn = orthogonal matrix;
    R ϵ R nxm = upper triangular matrix; and P ϵ R mxm = permutation matrix. During
    QR decomposition in constructing a Q matrix, the numerical pivoting scheme iteratively
    chooses the vectors in A according to their largest L 2 norm. This process maximizes
    the matrix volume and thus the absolute value of the determinant that amounts
    to a greedy algorithm that optimally enhances the condition of the matrix. This
    characteristic property of QR factorization is exploited for generating a well-chosen
    measurement matrix. QR decomposition of the data-driven basis matrix Ψ r is expressed
    as Ψ r P T = Q R (7) where P = M . Remarkably, besides enhancing the matrix condition,
    location numbers of the column pivoting procedure correspond to actual locations
    in the full-dimensional state space (i.e., a particular station number). For example,
    if the vector with maximum L 2 norm in Ψ r T is the third column, then the third
    station in state space vector d is the best station location to reconstruct the
    full-dimensional state d . In other words, besides enhancing the matrix condition,
    QR factorization with column pivoting also delivers the best sensor locations
    for optimal state reconstruction. This column pivoting procedure is subsequently
    executed until a desired number of station locations is identified. In fact, the
    chosen vectors also correspond to the locations of nonzero entries (which are
    in permutation matrix P and correspondingly in measurement matrix M ). Eventually,
    in order to interpolate to full state measurements, a hierarchical arrangement
    of all precipitation stations is provided in M . Once M is determined, coefficient
    vector a can be calculated via Eq. (5). Subsequently reconstructing full high
    dimensional state vector d from Eq. (2) with a desired number of pivots (stations)
    becomes a trivial task. Robust Empirical Orthogonal Function Analysis Real-world
    data is rarely free of noise and outliers. This is the case, especially for physical
    experimental data. Calculation of the EOF is based on fitting the data in the
    L 2 norm that renders EOF analysis sensitive to outliers and noise fluctuations
    (Scherl et al. 2020). To remove outliers and noise fluctuations from a raw observed
    data matrix, Candes et al. (2011) considered the data matrix D as a summation
    of a low-rank matrix L and a sparse matrix S . According to this procedure, L
    contains the dominant coherent patterns in D and S accommodates the outliers,
    noise fluctuations, or even corrupt data. As such, decomposition can be written
    as follows D = L + S (8) In fact, this is an ill-posed problem because the number
    of unknown variables is half the number of known variables. However, Candes et
    al. (2011) expressed the problem as a convex optimization routine. min rank ‖
    L ‖ * + λ ‖ S ‖ 1 subject to L + S = X (9) L, S λ = 1 / max ( n , m ) (10) where
    ‖ . ‖ * = nuclear norm which is defined as the sum of singular values; ‖ . ‖ 1
    = L 1 norm; λ = constant to inform the algorithm of the level of sparsity, and
    n and m = number of rows and columns of the data matrix, respectively. The rest
    of the algorithm is implemented by simply taking low-rank matrix L as our new
    data matrix D and implementing the methodology as described in Section “Empirical
    Orthogonal Function Analysis.” This method is called robust EOF (R-EOF) analysis
    where robust refers to the strength and accuracy of the model to outliers and
    corrupt data. Mean-Centered Empirical Orthogonal Function Analysis The preceding
    described standalone empirical orthogonal function (standalone EOF) procedure
    can alternatively start with generating the matrix D with mean-centered data.
    Particularly, the column-wise mean of the data matrix is computed and subtracted
    from corresponding columns (snapshots). This process forms a new, mean-centered
    data matrix D . Recently, mean-centering data have been reported to increase the
    success of a similar modal analysis, i.e., dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) (Hirsh
    et al. 2020). In this spirit, the mean-centered EOF and robust EOF analysis are
    also established. Hereafter, standalone (basic), mean-centered, robust, and robust
    mean-centered empirical orthogonal function versions are named EOF, MC-EOF, R-EOF,
    and R-MC-EOF, respectively. Performance Evaluation Criteria In the present study,
    a quantitative performance assessment of the models is conducted utilizing popular
    diagnostic metrics, Nash–Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency (CE), RMSE, and MAE
    (Solomatine and Shrestha 2009; Bowden et al. 2012; Altunkaynak and Nigussie 2015).
    The RMSE is a commonly used measure in statistics and machine learning to assess
    how well a model makes predictions. The underlying principle of RMSE involves
    calculating the average of the squared differences between predicted and actual
    values and taking the square root of this average. By dividing the sum of squared
    differences by the number of observations, RMSE provides an average measure of
    prediction error across the entire dataset. Taking the square root scales the
    result back to the original units of the dependent variable, making the RMSE interpretable
    and comparable in the same units as the target variable. As such, relatively low
    RMSE values indicate good model performance, while model predictions with larger
    RMSE imply poor reconstruction of the original snapshots. The CE value is a unitless
    metric that offers a comparative assessment of model performance, providing valuable
    insights into the efficiency of the model. CE has been broadly utilized in literature
    to evaluate the performance of models (Qi et al. 2017). The dimensionless CE metric
    ranges from − ∞ to 1 and is calculated as the ratio of the prediction error (residual)
    variance to the observation variance. A CE value of 1 signifies a perfect model,
    and models with NSE values approaching 1 are considered relatively close to perfection.
    Therefore, for a model to be deemed accurate, the residual variance must be markedly
    smaller than the variance of the observed dependable variable data. Conversely,
    if the residual variance is significantly greater than the variance of the observed
    data, it suggests that the model is deemed unacceptable. There is no universally
    standardized model classification based on CE values. Moriasi et al. (2007) propose
    that a model is considered to have achieved an acceptable level of success when
    its NSE value exceeds 0.5. Furthermore, as suggested by Donigan and Love (2003)
    and Wang and Altunkaynak (2012), a CE value falling within the range of 0.65–0.75
    indicates air model performance. A CE value in the range of 0.75–0.85 is illustrative
    of good model performance, while CE values surpassing 0.85 suggest a very good
    performance. The MAE is a metric used for assessing the accuracy of predictions
    made by a model. It calculates the average absolute difference between the predicted
    values and the actual values. MAE is robust to outliers and provides a straightforward
    and easily interpretable assessment of the model’s accuracy, with lower MAE values
    indicating better performance. Accordingly, in this study, the smallest RMSE and
    MAE and the largest CE values are indicative of the best model prediction performance.
    Results and Discussion Fig. 6 shows the average computed CE values of the model
    using a total of 1 to 18 stations’ precipitation data. As seen from the figure,
    with a CE value of 0.99, the robust mean-centered EOF (R-MC-EOF) model remarkably
    well predicts the future precipitation data in the watershed basin only using
    data from six stations. R-EOF, MC-EOF, and EOF methods reach the same level of
    accuracy ( CE = 0.99 ) using data from 7, 12, and 13 stations, respectively. The
    level of success achieved by the R-MC-EOF method is particularly striking. Even
    for four stations, CE is 0.96 and the model performance is very good according
    to the Donigan and Love (2003) performance assessment criteria ( CE > 0.85 ).
    Note that when using data from four stations, the CE value of the standalone EOF
    method is only approximately 0.4, while the CE value of the R-EOF method is found
    to be 0.92. This implies that the whole watershed basin can be represented even
    with four stations with representative precipitation predictions of the region
    in place of 18 stations. Fig. 6 shows that robust methodology significantly enhanced
    the prediction performance of basic EOF even via using precipitation data from
    four stations. The standalone EOF model is too flexible and suffers from outliers
    or large noise fluctuations and has worse validation accuracy relative to those
    of the MC-EOF, R-EOF, and MC-R-EOF models. According to CE values, it is clearly
    noticed that the R-EOF algorithm exhibited superior performance when compared
    to the EOF method, indicating the great ability of robust procedure in eliminating
    outliers or large noise fluctuations from the raw observed data matrix. Fig. 7
    illustrates the removed stations by R-MC-EOF and MC-EOF models in the geographic
    map of the region. SVD provides a stable numerical framework for performing EOF
    analysis; however, SVD utilizes the L 2 norm criterion in determining the modes
    and associated time dynamics. Squaring the distance between data points and the
    fitting subspace makes the difference even larger. Therefore, outliers or large
    noise fluctuations heavily distort the singular values and singular vectors. To
    circumvent this drawback, instead of a generic least square metric, a measure
    of the L 1 norm that is robust to large noise fluctuations and outliers is implemented
    in the R-EOF analysis. Particularly, the original (raw) observed data matrix is
    decomposed into two matrices, i.e., a matrix that contains the low-rank features
    of the data and a sparse portion of data with spikes, outliers, and noise components.
    The low-rank data matrix is considered free of error, and a corruption real data
    matrix where matrix S is thought to be an artifact. To further elaborate, original
    data matrix D , low-rank and error matrices L and S are illustrated in Fig. 8.
    Evident from Fig. 8 is that the peaks and some small portion of the data in the
    original data are trimmed and represented in the matrix S . Random nature of the
    precipitation data seems to be removed, in a sense, and the original (raw) observed
    data matrix is somewhat transformed to a relatively deterministic signal. Fig.
    9 illustrates the singular values and cumulative energy of both the original data
    matrix ( X ) and smoothened data matrix ( L ) with the R-EOF algorithm in log
    scale. Except for the first singular value, singular values of the original data
    matrix decay exponentially (Fig. 9a), and cumulative energy increases gradually
    and reaches absolute unity at a total station number of 18. On the other hand,
    singular values of the low-rank matrix ( L ) provided by the R-EOF framework decrease
    and make a sharp cut off at the tenth singular value. Given that cumulative energy
    attains 0.97 with the first three modes, it is not surprising that with only gathering
    information from four (4) stations, robust QR with column pivoting algorithm almost
    perfectly reconstructs the full state future state vectors. It is evidently realized
    that robust procedure eliminates high-frequency peaks and noise components from
    the data. However, whether the portion of the original data that is in S is composed
    of only large noise fluctuations or/and systematic error spikes, which are not
    part of system dynamics, is questionable. The assertion may be true or not depending
    on the type or nature of the data. One may alternatively consider altering the
    λ parameter to adjust the separation level of data and error components. In the
    original formulation, λ is 0.0518 and as λ increases, less portion of the data
    matrix is partitioned into the S matrix. However, as the L matrix more resembles
    the original matrix, the diagnostic assessment metrics approaches to those of
    the standalone EOF (or MC-EOF) method. Therefore, depending on the sort or nature
    of the data, usage of R-EOF analysis can be considered. Fig. 6. CE values of the
    developed models with respect to total station number. Fig. 7. Removed stations
    by R-MC-EOF and MC-EOF models in the geographic map of the region. (Map data ©

    EOF analysis in space-time coordinates. Fig. 9. (a–d) Singular values and cumulative
    energy contained in original data matrix X and sparse matrix L . In addition to
    the superiority of robust analysis, mean-centered models also outperform their
    standalone counterparts. CE value of the R-MC-EOF model for four total stations
    is 0.97, and the R-EOF model CE value is 0.92 with the same number of stations
    (Fig. 6). Similarly, the performance of the MC-EOF approach is very good according
    to Donigan and Love (2003) with using data from eight stations ( CE = 0.85 );
    however, the same level of accuracy is achieved by the standalone EOF model by
    using data from 10 stations. Depending on the application or objective, in some
    situations (e.g., limited cost and labor), a rather average accuracy level may
    be of interest. For such cases, a lower number of sensor placements without sacrificing
    much accuracy can be established. Indeed, according to Moriasi et al. (2007),
    measuring data in as low as one station yields an acceptable level of performance
    ( CE = 0.53 > 0.50 ) when the R-MC-EOF method is considered. When MC-EOF is implemented
    deployment of six stations is enough to develop a fair model ( CE = 0.65 ) or
    a good model ( CE = 0.78 ) for seven stations (Donigan and Love 2003). A further
    investigation of the log plot of the singular value spectrum and cumulative sum
    of energy contained in the EOF modes (Fig. 9) reveals that the first singular
    value is very large and contains 59% of the energy contained within the data.
    Furthermore, the first seven modes represent almost 90% of energy implying that
    the most important dynamics of the system are extracted with the first seven EOFs.
    Indeed, despite the complex and nonlinear nature of rainfall, the identified intrinsic
    relatively low-rank nature of the system captures the full richness of the data
    enabling accurate reconstruction of state space data vectors if sensor locations
    are selected wisely. This is not only limited to rainfall phenomena, as many real-life
    complicated high dimensional dynamic systems such as ocean dynamics (Yildirim
    et al. 2009), turbulent wake in flow past a circular cylinder (Schmid 2010), and
    neuroscience (Brunton et al. 2016) evolve on a low-dimensional attractor. RMSE
    and MAE are the other evaluation criteria used in the present study. Figs. 10
    and 11 illustrate the RMSE and MAE values versus the number of rain gauge stations
    used in recovering the system dynamics, respectively. As for the CE, the mean-centered
    robust EOF (R-MC-EOF) approach is superior to the remaining methods in reconstructing
    future time spatial data. RMSE and MAE values of the R-MC-EOF model results are
    relatively small initially and further decay in an exponential fashion as the
    number of stations used in the prediction is increased. R-EOF is the second successful
    model followed by mean-centered MC-EOF and standalone EOF models. R-EOF and to
    some extent mean-centered EOF models’ root mean square errors also decay exponentially;
    however, they decay with a very slow decay rate. The standalone EOF model has
    the worst performance with the highest RMSE values and shows a linear error decay
    trend as the number of sensors increases. Remarkably, the R-MC-EOF model achieves
    reconstructing the full state data at machine precision accuracy for as low as
    13 stations, while R-EOF and MC-EOF model results achieve the same level of accuracy
    for total station numbers 15 and 16, respectively. The standalone EOF model can
    only achieve machine error accuracy by using all 18 stations’ data performing
    a poor model performance. Fig. 10. RMSE values of the developed models with respect
    to the total number of stations. Fig. 11. MAE values of the developed models with
    respect to the total number of stations. We have developed three variations of
    the EOF model in this study: the mean-centered EOF model (MC-EOF), the robust
    EOF model (R-EOF), and the robust mean-centered EOF model (R-MC-EOF). This study
    developed new predictive models combined with QR as a modeling tool in order to
    improve prediction accuracy and determine optimal sensor locations. The prediction
    accuracy and determination of optimal sensor locations were improved by the combined
    mean-centered EOF (MC-EOF), the robust EOF (R-EOF), and the robust mean-centered
    EOF (R-MC-EOF) models. In this study, the EOF model is used as a modeling tool
    to provide accurate prediction results and determine optimal sensor locations.
    The patterns of monthly rainfall data are extracted by the EOF framework so that
    tangible analysis can be undertaken and that accurate prediction results can be
    obtained with optimal sensor data. For this reason, as the results of this study
    readily indicate, the MC-EOF, R-EOF, and R-MC-EOF models are essential in enhancing
    the prediction accuracy of monthly rainfall time series data even with fewer sensors.
    To the best of our knowledge, this EOF developed in this study has not been used
    with the combination of a QR decomposition algorithm for rainfall time series
    data. The developed MC-EOF, R-EOF, and R-MC-EOF models were successfully implemented
    for more accurate predictions of rainfall data using a small number of sensors.
    When the highest CE and lowest RMSE and MAE values are considered, the robust
    mean-centered R-MC-EOF model outperforms the remaining models. The success of
    R-MC-EOF is closely followed by the R-EOF model. MC-EOF and standalone EOF model
    performances are also good since, for instance, full high dimensional state space
    reconstruction may be materialized at a very good level by using 10 or 12 stations.
    In the present study, standalone EOF, MC-EOF, R-EOF, and R-MC-EOF models significantly
    reduce the number of stations in the network yet accurately predict the spatiotemporal
    precipitation data. In addition, the robust approach has the ability to remove
    outliers or large noise fluctuations from the raw observed data matrix. Generating
    an optimal configuration for precipitation stations is crucial for cost-effectively
    acquiring precise spatiotemporal data. This is particularly important due to the
    substantial operational, management, and maintenance expenses associated with
    maintaining stations, as well as the need to efficiently handle missing data.
    Consequently, high-resolution data is not always readily available, therefore,
    it is essential to optimize the configuration of precipitation stations in order
    to extract the maximum amount of information with an optimal number of stations
    in the network. The full state space reconstruction of the precipitation basin
    can be accomplished using data from different total numbers of stations. Expectedly,
    the accuracy of the reconstruction will increase with the number of total stations.
    The introduced R-MC-EOF model in this study provides very accurate prediction
    results by only utilizing four total stations. This remarkable achievement is
    valuable since many areas lack extensive instrumentation for measuring precipitation
    and other hydrologic variables due to financial constraints, limited accessibility,
    challenging topography, and adverse weather conditions. If the assumptions of
    the R-MC-EOF model are not met, the developed MC-EOF and standalone EOF models
    in the present study may be utilized. In this case, using data from 10 and 12
    total number of precipitation stations yield similar levels of accuracy, respectively.
    Furthermore, organizing spatiotemporal data into a matrix that incorporates both
    spatial and temporal dimensions enables the development of advanced models using
    a minimal number of station data points. This approach aims to identify specific
    stations that provide the most crucial information while keeping the overall number
    of stations to a minimum. From an economic perspective, it is recommended to present
    a model that can simulate spatiotemporal data for precipitation or any hydrologic
    variable. This model should utilize a matrix structure that distinctly represents
    both space and time, incorporating optimal model inputs. The intended audience
    for such a model includes decision makers, administrators, local authorities,
    and technical operators. Therefore, the development of an accurate spatiotemporal
    model that can forecast future values of hydrological variables based on historical
    data and optimal model inputs is of utmost importance. This model can greatly
    assist in informed decision making and planning in hydrological and water resource
    management. Conclusion Optimal precipitation station network design is an important
    concept in obtaining data that are representative of the precipitation of the
    region economically. Low accessibility conditions because of challenging basin
    topography and bad weather conditions also necessitate the importance of gathering
    maximum data using the lowest number of sensors. This study proposes a sparse
    precipitation gauge placement methodology to optimize the number of measurement
    stations. Using a powerful tool from linear algebra that is QR matrix factorization
    with column pivoting on a data-driven EOF basis is advocated to determine the
    density and location of the precipitation stations in the Upper Euphrates region
    in east Anatolia, Turkey. The methodology exploits the fact that the high-dimensional
    natural phenomenon evolves on a low-dimensional feature subspace. To extract spatiotemporal
    coherent patterns in the Upper Euphrates basin EOF analysis is carried out. In
    particular, standalone EOF, robust EOF (R-EOF), mean-centered EOF (MC-EOF), and
    robust mean-centered EOF (R-MC-EOF) modes are determined and used as a sparse
    basis to represent the spatiotemporal precipitation data of the watershed basin.
    Importantly, for the first time, R-EOF analysis has been carried out in a hydrological
    predictive study. Determined basis matrices are fed into the QR decomposition
    with a column pivoting algorithm, and sparse sensor locations are identified.
    Both R-EOF and MC-EOF approaches outperformed their standalone counterparts. Further,
    it is found that the information in 18 real-world deployed precipitation gauges
    can very accurately be extracted by four, five, 10, and 12 stations with R-MC-EOF,
    R-EOF, MC-EOF, and standalone EOF data-driven bases, respectively. While applying
    the R-EOF approach, the nature of the methodology attempts to distinguish outliers,
    large peaks, and noise fluctuations from the original data; therefore, care has
    to be taken depending on the type and origin of the data in interpreting the separated
    matrices. The installment and maintenance burden of deploying physical measurement
    stations hinders the design of dense precipitation measurement networks. However,
    the results of this study indicate that from a relatively low number of monitoring
    stations, representative and reliable spatial and temporal field data can be obtained.
    QR with pivoting architecture is a simple-to-use built-in algorithm in all popular
    programming environments such as Python, MATLAB, and R. Success and easy-to-use
    features of the EOF analysis in developing a representative data-driven basis
    to identify the sparse locations of the precipitation gauges with QR column pivoting
    algorithm provide a future direction of applying this methodology to various scientific
    fields. Data Availability Statement Some or all data, models, or code that support

  description: Water shortage and soil salinization are important factors restricting
    crop production worldwide. To conduct accurate yield prediction and reasonable
    crop layout, more attention should be paid to the performances of crop resistance
    and resilience under water and salt stress and their trade-off relationships.
    Here, we set different water (full irrigation, W0; moderate deficit irrigation,
    W1; and severe deficit irrigation, W2) and salt (S0, S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, and S6,
    representing 0 ‰, 1 ‰, 2 ‰, 3 ‰, 4 ‰, 5 ‰, and 6 ‰ salt in soil) treatments. Together
    with relevant studies, we analyzed the performances of forage resistance (Rt)
    and resilience (Rs) and their relationships under varied water and salt stress.
    The results indicated that logarithmic Rt (lg(Rt), the same as lg(Rs)) and the
    distribution of lg(Rs) were affected by water and salt stress, however, the relationships
    of lg(Rs)-lg(Rt) stayed stable with the constant slopes (k) and declined intercepts
    (m) as stress intensified. The physiological mechanisms and trade-offs for fixed
    species remained robust while the growth potentials varied under stress, which
    were closely related to stomatal regulations. Forage with larger |k| was suitable
    for fully irrigated regions to achieve higher yields, while regions with detrimental
    water and salt conditions should select cultivars with smaller |k| to ensure production.
    This study laid the groundwork for the estimation of the perennial forage adaptation
    and stability, and the method of long-term yield prediction and cultivar management
    under soil water and salt stress.

  explanation: "The study first examined the impact of water and salt stress on Rt\
    \ and Rs. Soil water and salt stress negatively affected lg(Rt), with a greater\
    \ effect under combined stresses. However, lg(Rs) exhibited a different pattern,\
    \ with no significant differences among treatments and more cuttings in risky\
    \ zones in autumn and winter. Trade-offs were observed between lg(Rt) and lg(Rs),\
    \ characterized by constant slopes (k) and declining intercepts (m) as stress\
    \ intensified. The intercepts represented potential regrowth capacity, which was\
    \ reduced by stress and regulated by osmotic adjustment and stomatal behavior.\
    \ \n\nThe second part of the study investigated the robustness of the trade-off\
    \ relationships and plasticity of the intercept under varied water and salt stress.\
    \ The trade-off relationships remained stable across different water and salt\
    \ stress levels, indicating a robust physiological mechanism and trade-offs. However,\
    \ species and cultivars showed variations in k values, which were related to their\
    \ growth characteristics and stress tolerance mechanisms. Cultivars with larger\
    \ |k| were suitable for fully irrigated regions, while those with smaller |k|\
    \ were more resilient in rain-fed or water-stressed conditions.\n\nFinally, the\
    \ study explored the relationship between the intercept (m) and stress intensity.\
    \ The intercept, representing potential growth capacity, declined at a decreasing\
    \ rate with increasing stress. This was attributed to limited photosynthate allocation,\
    \ which shifted from tissue construction to more conservative survival and maintenance.\
    \ The study established a relationship between m and stress intensity, which can\
    \ be used to quantify the impact of stress on plant growth."
  extract_1: The relationship between m and gs of different treatments was shown in
    Fig. 6. Representing the potential maximum growth capacity, m was affected by
    osmotic regulation, stomatal behavior, and photosynthetic accumulation (Medrano
    et al., 2002).
  extract_2: More investments in structural carbohydrate will promote physical strength
    and resistance to stress, but also affect the investment in nutrient storage and
    osmotic adjustment due to limited assimilation resources, and further affect the
    regulation of potential growth (Miller et al., 2017).

    stayed stable under different water and salt stress. • The physiological mechanisms
    and trade-offs for fixed species remained robust while the growth potentials varied
    under stress. • Forages with larger slope work in fully irrigated regions, while
    regions under stress are fit for cultivars with smaller slope. Abstract Water
    shortage and soil salinization are important factors restricting crop production
    worldwide. To conduct accurate yield prediction and reasonable crop layout, more
    attention should be paid to the performances of crop resistance and resilience
    under water and salt stress and their trade-off relationships. Here, we set different
    water (full irrigation, W0; moderate deficit irrigation, W1; and severe deficit
    irrigation, W2) and salt (S0, S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, and S6, representing 0 ‰, 1
    ‰, 2 ‰, 3 ‰, 4 ‰, 5 ‰, and 6 ‰ salt in soil) treatments. Together with relevant
    studies, we analyzed the performances of forage resistance (Rt) and resilience
    (Rs) and their relationships under varied water and salt stress. The results indicated
    that logarithmic Rt (lg(Rt), the same as lg(Rs)) and the distribution of lg(Rs)
    were affected by water and salt stress, however, the relationships of lg(Rs)-lg(Rt)
    stayed stable with the constant slopes (k) and declined intercepts (m) as stress

    robust while the growth potentials varied under stress, which were closely related

    regions to achieve higher yields, while regions with detrimental water and salt
    conditions should select cultivars with smaller |k| to ensure production. This
    study laid the groundwork for the estimation of the perennial forage adaptation
    and stability, and the method of long-term yield prediction and cultivar management
    under soil water and salt stress. Graphical abstract Hypothetical relationship
    and trade-off strategy of forage in this study. (a) Possible effects of water
    and salt stress on the relationship of resistance lg(Rs) and resilience lg(Rt)
    (of the form lg(Rs) = k × lg(Rt) + m). Here, we assume that the relationships
    under two conditions/cultivars stay robust if the slopes (k) remain unchanged
    with only the alteration of value ranges (a1) or intercepts (m) (a2), but change
    when the k alter (a3). (b) Trade-offs of forage under varied water and salt stress.
    k for given cultivar is constant under different stress (b1 and b2), however,
    differs when cultivar changes (b2 and b3). Cuttings with their lg(Rt) and lg(Rs)
    in green area (safe zone) have lower growth rate but greater regrowth potential,
    on the contrary, cuttings with their lg(Rt) and lg(Rs) in red area (risky zone)
    have higher growth rate but lower regrowth potential. Safe and risky zones are
    divided by lg(Rs) = 0 (dash line). Download : Download high-res image (188KB)

    adjustmentSpecies 1. Introduction Facing severe water shortage, ongoing soil salinization
    (Munns et al., 2020), and frequent extreme climate events (Choat et al., 2012),
    it is important to understand how crops respond to external stress. Resistance
    (Rt) and resilience (Rs) are generally used to assess the fitness of ecosystems,
    communities or individuals under climate drought events from two aspects, reflecting
    the acclimation and stability (Jia et al., 2020). The Rt indicates the ability
    to maintain productivity in drought events, whilst Rs reflects the ability to
    recover to their pre-disturbance states or functions from being disturbed (Isbell
    et al., 2015; Scheffer et al., 2001). After being put forward into the field of
    ecology by Holling (1973), the definition of Rs varied a lot, depending on the
    specific research topics, disturbance types, and experimental environments (Carvalho
    et al., 2019; Duveneck and Scheller, 2015). Both traits decreased with the intensified
    climate drought, but the variations differed in different vegetation types (Isbell
    et al., 2015; Li et al., 2020; Stuart-Haëntjens et al., 2018). There are great
    variations in the phenotypes, physiological and ecological mechanisms of different
    species under stress, whose relationships between Rt and Rs can be affected by
    assimilate distribution (Cui et al., 2020), hydraulic characteristics, photosynthetic
    characteristics (Craine et al., 2012; Qi et al., 2021), expression and metabolism
    (Bai et al., 2018; Feyissa et al., 2019), etc., representing the adjustment of
    the investment proportion between growth and survival factors. Choat et al. (2012)
    showed the ubiquitous trade-offs between survival and growth in all forest biomes,
    which were, however, different among species, and may be affected by individual
    hydraulic safety margin (HSM) (Oliveira et al., 2021). Cole (1995) demonstrated
    that Rt and Rs of herbs were negatively correlated, and the correlation changed
    with species. C4 species can maintain higher photosynthetic capacity and water
    use efficiency (WUE), however, their metabolic process was usually more restricted
    compared to that of C3 grasses, leading to a slower speed of recovery from drought,
    and a possible loss of photosynthetic advantage under severe drought (Taylor et
    al., 2014). Species with higher resistance to drought often performed worse during
    recovery from drought stress; on the contrary, species with lower resistance have
    higher recovery ability, which was related to limited carbohydrate consumption
    (Hoffmann et al., 2018; O’Grady et al., 2013; Ogasa et al., 2013). The relationships
    between Rt and Rs depend on strategies of different plants under stress. Several
    studies demonstrated the responses of Rt and Rs of forestry and grassland ecosystems
    to climate change, as well as their temporal and spatial trade-offs (Craine et
    al., 2012; Isbell et al., 2015; Li et al., 2020), however, seldom have researchers
    focused on the relationships of perennial forage. The sustainable development
    of forage is of great significance to the production of livestock and dairy industry
    and the alleviation of food crisis, however, the survival and persistence of forage
    are likely to be restricted by abiotic factors in future climate scenarios (Habermann
    et al., 2021; Norton et al., 2016). As two of the most common abiotic stress,
    water and salt stress inhibit a series of processes, including transpiration (Hu
    et al., 2020), photosynthesis (Qi et al., 2021), biomass accumulation (Ripley
    et al., 2010), etc., and plants will respond via adjusting leaf area, stomatal
    behaviors, hydraulic structures (Novick et al., 2019; Staniak et al., 2017), etc.
    However, species in different environments would respond to drought through different
    physiological mechanisms, which might be affected by limited carbon assimilation
    (Anderegg and HilleRisLambers, 2016). De Keersmaecker et al. (2015) and Fang and
    Zhang (2019) quantified the responses of vegetation resistance and resilience
    to atmospheric drought and temperature anomalies; however, the responses of resistance
    and resilience under different soil water and salt stress, and whether their trade-offs
    change with stress level are still unclear. Hence, based on the general concept
    of Rt and Rs (Isbell et al., 2015), the hypotheses of Rt and Rs (Eq.(1) and Eq.(2))
    and the trade-off relationships were proposed (Fig. 1): (1) (2) where Y and Ys
    are the aboveground biomass of non-stress and stress treatments at each forage
    harvest, respectively, and i is the number of cuttings. Both Rt and Rs were calculated
    as relative values for consistency, and the general logarithmic forms were used
    (Cui et al., 2020; Reich et al., 1997; Wright et al., 2004), as shown in Fig.
    1a: (3) where k was the slope of the relationship of lg(Rs) and lg(Rt), and m
    was the intercept (the intersection of line lg(Rs)-lg(Rt) and y-axis). When the
    degree of water and salt stress or crop cultivar changes, if the slopes and intercepts
    of lg(Rs)-lg(Rt) keep constant with varied value ranges, the relationships remain
    unchanged (Fig. 1a1); if the slopes remain while the intercepts change, the relationships
    are still stable, with only lg(Rs) changes under given lg(Rt) (Fig. 1a2); but
    if the slopes alter significantly, the empirical relationships change (Fig. 1a3).
    For one given treatment, lg(Rt) is higher although with a declining inclination
    when lg(Rs) < 0, plants tend to accumulate biomass instead of sustaining regrowth
    capacity, and the data area is defined as the “risky zone”; on the contrary, when
    lg(Rs) > 0, plants tend to perform higher growth potential rather than short-term
    biomass accumulation, and the data area is defined as the “safe zone”. Together
    with ours and relevant researches, we further clarify the hypotheses (Fig. 1b),
    that the slope (k) of lg(Rs)-lg(Rt) remains stable for a fixed cultivar, with
    only intercepts (m) change along gradients of stress (Fig. 1b1 and b2), but varies
    with cultivars (Fig. 1b2 and b3). Our study aims to: (1) explore whether the relationships
    between Rt and Rs under atmospheric drought are applicable for perennial forage
    under water and salt stress, and their responses; (2) examine the robustness of
    the trade-off relationships between Rt and Rs for different species and cultivars;
    (3) analyze the reasons for intercept variations under different water and salt
    stress, and quantify the response of m to varied water and salt stress. Download

    Hypothetical relationship and trade-off strategy of forages in this study. (a)
    Possible effects of water and salt stress on the relationship of resistance lg(Rs)
    and resilience lg(Rt) (of the form lg(Rs) = k × lg(Rt) + m). Here, we assume that
    the relationships under two conditions/cultivars stay robust if the slopes (k)
    remain unchanged with only the alteration of value ranges (a1) or intercepts (m)
    (a2), but change when the k alter (a3). Adapted from (Cui et al., 2020). (b) Trade-offs
    of forage under varied water and salt stress. k for given cultivar is constant
    under different stress (b1 and b2), however, differs when cultivar changes (b2
    and b3). Cuttings with their lg(Rt) and lg(Rs) in green area (safe zone) have
    lower growth rate but greater regrowth potential, on the contrary, cuttings with
    their lg(Rt) and lg(Rs) in red area (risky zone) have higher growth rate but lower
    regrowth potential. Safe and risky zones are divided by lg(Rs) = 0 (dash line).
    2. Materials and methods 2.1. Experimental conditions The pot and plot experiments
    were conducted at the Shiyanghe Experimental Station of China Agricultural University
    (102°52′E, 37°52′N; elevation, 1581 m) from 2017 to 2019, both in an open field
    close to each other. The site is in the middle reach of Shiyanghe River Basin
    with a continental temperate climate, and mean annual total sunshine duration
    is over 3000 h, mean annual temperature is 8 °C, and average annual precipitation
    is 164 mm. 2.2. Experimental design 2.2.1. Pot experiment Two batches of pot experiments
    were conducted in 2018 and 2019 (pot experiment I), and in 2017, 2018 and 2019
    (pot experiment II), respectively. Alfalfa (Medicago sativa cv. Golden Empress)
    was harvested at the early flowering stage, and the growth periods and season
    were shown in Table 1. Three irrigation amount levels were applied as W0 (full),
    W1 (moderate deficit) and W2 (severe deficit), W0 was irrigated from 65 to 70
    % of field capacity (θf) to 95–100 % θf, and W1 and W2 were irrigated with 2/3
    and 1/2 irrigation amount of W0, respectively (Table S1). Fresh water was used
    for irrigation every 1–7 days (d) according to environmental conditions during
    growing seasons. For soil salinity levels, S0, S1, S2, S3, S4, and S5 were set,
    representing 0 ‰, 1 ‰, 2 ‰, 3 ‰, 4 ‰, and 5 ‰ salt was mixed with the soil (mass
    ratio) before planting, respectively (Table S2). Because of the salt leaching
    caused by winter irrigation, we supplemented soil salinity to the set levels by
    saline irrigation, before the first growth periods began in the following years,
    also with the plot experiment (Section 2.2.2). The salt was made up of NaCl, MgSO4,
    and CaSO4 at a mass ratio of 2:2:1, according to the chemical composition of local
    groundwater. Each treatment has 20 pots as replicates. Growth periods of cuttings
    were divided to early summer (ES), late summer (LS), and autumn (AU) cuttings
    according to local climate. The plot experiment data were also analyzed to examine
    the robustness of the relationships. Table 1. Growth periods, seasons and climate

    indicated early summer, late summer and autumn, respectively. 2.2.2. Plot experiment
    The plot-grown alfalfa was planted on May 5th, 2017, and the experiment was carried
    out from June 6th, 2018, to September 20th, 2019 (Table 1). Two irrigation amounts
    (W0 and W2, Table S3), and four soil salinity levels (S0, S2, S4, and S6, Table
    S4) were set. Fresh water was used for irrigation every 15–30 d according to environmental
    conditions. Eight treatments in 2018 and four selected treatments with two replicates
    (W0S0, W2S2, W2S4, and W2S6) in 2019 were conducted. The salt was added to the
    0–80 cm soil depth by saline irrigation, the soil physical properties and more
    details can be found in (Table S5; Hu et al., 2021). 2.3. Measurements 2.3.1.
    Meteorological data An automatic weather station (Hobo, Onset Computer Corp.,
    CapeCod, MA USA) in the experimental site was used to collect meteorological data
    every 15 min, including solar radiation (Rs), air temperature (Ta), relative humidity
    (RH), wind speed (u), precipitation (P), and etc. 2.3.2. Crop height, leaf area
    index and biomass Crop height was measured manually every 5–7 d, and leaf area
    index (LAI, m2 m−2) every 4–5 d by a plant canopy analyzer (LAI-2200C, LI-COR
    Corporate, Lincoln, NE USA), both with four replicates. Alfalfa was sampled six
    times when harvested, with the stems and leaves separately oven dried at 105 °C
    for 30 min and then dried at 70 °C to constant weight under forced ventilation.
    2.3.3. Leaf water potential The predawn leaf water potential (φw) was measured
    on clear days from 4:30 to 5:00 AM in six replicates during the third and fourth
    cuttings, using a dew point water potential meter (WP4-C, Decagon, Pullman, CA
    USA). The osmotic potential (φs) of sap expressed from corresponding freeze–thawed
    leaves was measured using a vapor pressure osmometer (Vapro5600, Wescor, Inc.,
    USA) (Ball and Oosterhuis, 2005). The leaf turgor pressure (φp) was calculated
    as the difference between φw and φs. 2.3.4. Stomatal conductance The observed
    leaf stomatal conductance (gs, m s−1) on the measurement days of leaf water potential
    were obtained from the rearranged Penman-Monteith (P-M) model using evapotranspiration
    (ET) and meteorological data. The P-M model is (Monteith, 1965): (4) where ET
    is the crop evapotranspiration (mm d−1), which was calculated by the dual crop
    coefficient method (Hu et al., 2020), Rn'' is the net radiation intercepted by
    crop canopy (MJ m−2 d−1), G is the soil heat flux density (MJ m−2 d−1), which
    is zero at a daily step, λ is the latent heat of vaporization (MJ kg−1), Δ is
    the slope vapor pressure curve (kPa °C−1), CP is the specific heat of dry air
    at constant pressure (MJ kg−1 °C−1), ρa is the air density (kg m−3), γ is the
    psychrometric constant (kPa °C−1), VPD is the vapor pressure deficit (kPa), ra
    is the aerodynamic resistance (s m−1), and gc is the canopy conductance (m s−1)
    with an acceptable approximation as follows (Allen et al., 1998): (5) where LAIactive
    is the effective leaf area index (m2 m−2). Thus the value of gs is calculated
    by: (6) The parameters Rn'', ra, and LAIactive can be derived by (Gardiol et al.,
    2003; Goudriaan and Laar, 1994; Thom, 1972): (7) (8) (9) where Rn is the net radiation
    (MJ m−2 d−1), ke is the light extinction coefficient and assumed to be 0.89 (Teixeira
    et al., 2011), Z is the reference height (m), the zero plane displacement height
    d (m) is estimated as d = 0.67hc, hc is the mean crop height (m), Z0 is the roughness
    length governing transfer of heat and vapor (m), ka is Karman constant (0.41),
    and uz is the wind speed at height z (m s−1). 2.4. Relationship qualification
    In terms of easy application, we qualified the responses of the intercept of lg(Rs)-lg(Rt)
    relationship to irrigation amount and soil salinity. Considering the close relationships
    between m and the accumulation of photosynthate, we referred to previous studies
    on production function. The Jensen model is one of the most widely used water
    production functions that take growth stages into consideration (Jensen, 1968),
    based on which Zhang and Guo (1998) introduced salt stress factors to better consider
    the impact of combined water and salt stress on crop production. Combined the
    experimental results (Fig. 2b), the form of m changing with the relative irrigation
    amount and soil salinity was proposed (Eq. (10), Fig. 2c): (10) where Irrir was
    the relative irrigation amount, Sr was the relative soil salinity (‰), λ and σ
    were the water and salt sensitivity index, respectively. Μ was the scale factor,
    equal to the m value of the non-stress treatment, reflecting maximum m under different
    growth circumstances. The determination coefficient (r2) was used to evaluate
    the simulation accuracy. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download

    Data from additional representative studies concerning selected forage species
    (alfalfa, red clover (Trifolium pratense), festulolium (Festuca x Lolium), bufffel
    grass (Cenchrus ciliaris), and rhodes grass (Chloris gayana)) growth under different
    water and salt stress were collected, as shown in Table 2. The evaluation included
    stress-susceptible and stress-tolerant cultivars of C3 and C4 species tested in
    both greenhouse and field, and pots and plots. Table 2. Background information

    2.6. Statistical analysis The statistical differences of Rt and Rs under different
    water and salt treatments and their interaction were examined by two-tailed significance
    test, and φw and φp among different water and salt treatments were examined by
    one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the Duncan test at the p = 0.05 level,
    using SPSS 21.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL USA). Regression analysis was conducted
    to examine the relationships between lg(Rs) and lg(Rs) under different water and
    salt stress and varied cultivars, and the differences among them by the covariance
    analysis (ANCOVA) test using the OriginPro 2018 (OriginLab Corporation, Northampton,
    MA USA), where their intercepts would be further examined in the premise of constant
    slopes. After the establishment of relationship between the intercept and the
    relative irrigation amount and soil salinity, SPSS 21.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL
    USA) was used to fit the empirical parameters with the nonlinear least-squares
    method. 3. Results 3.1. Response of resistance and resilience of alfalfa to different
    water and salt stress The responses of Rt and Rs to soil water and salt stress
    were shown in Fig. 3. The lg(Rt) indicated the ability of plant to resist water
    and salt stress and maintain growth, which decreased with increasing stress (Fig.
    3a). Water and salt stress significantly reduced the lg(Rt), with an interaction
    being observed also between water stress and salinity, exacerbating the reduction
    of lg(Rt), as the gap among different salinity treatments diminished as water
    stress further intensified, and vice versa. The lg(Rs) indicated the regrowth
    ability under stress, although no significant differences were found among treatments,
    more cuttings in more severe stress treatments were in the safe zone, i.e., plants
    tended to maintain potential regrowth rather than have rapid biomass accumulation
    (Fig. 3b). The lg(Rt) of alfalfa declined along gradients of stress, whereas the
    distribution of lg(Rs) showed more safe behaviors. Hence, there could be trade-off
    relationships between lg(Rt) and lg(Rs) under water and salt stress. Download

    forages under water and salt stress The relationships between lg(Rs) and lg(Rt)
    of pot-grown alfalfa under different water and salt stress from 2017 to 2019 were
    shown in Fig. 2, and there was no significant difference among the slopes by ANCOVA
    test, only the intercepts (m) varied (Eq. (3)). The relationships of lg(Rt)-lg(Rs)
    kept stable, i.e., k was consistent among different treatments with only m varied.
    m decreased at a declining rate as the stress intensified, indicating that the
    regrowth ability under given resistance was reduced. Although the ES and LS cuttings
    varied a lot, most AU cuttings were in the risky zone (Fig. 2a), denoting that
    the cuttings in autumn and winter were prone to higher Rt, for the material and
    energy reservation before dormancy. The trade-offs between resistance and resilience
    varied among different forage cultivars. Fig. 4 showed the lg(Rs)-lg(Rt) relationships
    of different forage species under varied water (Fig. 4a-d2) and salt stress (Fig.
    4e-h4), and the details can be found in Table 2. Generally, throughout our results,
    the relationships remained robust under different water and salt stress (constant
    k), while the intercepts decreased at a reducing rate with increasing stress.
    However, the relationships altered with varied cultivars (varied k), which were
    closely related to their growth and physiological characteristics (Fig. 4i). The
    average k of buffel grass (cv. Gayanda, Coelachyrum and Cenchrus spp.) (−0.64)
    was greater than alfalfa (cv. Aragón, WL-309, Kometa, Garisenda, Golden Empress,
    Ismaelia, Siwa, and New Valley) (−1.01) with rhodes grass (cv. Katambora and Callide),
    red clover (cv. Bona), and Festulolium (cv. Sulino and Agula) were intermediate
    at −0.87, −0.91, and − 0.91, respectively (Table 2). Compared with the other four
    species, |k| of the buffel grass (0.64) was the lowest, rhodes grass came second,
    and alfalfa has the highest |k| (1.01), which varied greatly with species. The
    average |k| value for C4 forages was 0.74, lower than 0.98 for C3 forages. What''s
    more, |k| of the species with relatively high tolerance (0.81) is smaller than
    that of the species with lower tolerance (1.03). When lg(Rt) changed in a certain
    range, the variations of lg(Rs) for the cultivars with smaller |k| were relatively
    smaller, denoting more stable growth. It was notable that although the k remained
    constant between pot- and plot-grown alfalfa under stress, there was a difference
    between the variations of m (Fig. 4f). Our results showed that the trade-offs
    between lg(Rt) and lg(Rs) were cultivar-specific, unaffected by soil water and
    salt conditions; and only the intercepts of the relationship were altered. Download

    in the intercept of relationship between lg(Rt) and lg(Rs) under different water
    and salt stress Soil water and salt stress would downgrade soil water potential
    (φw), and further affect the growth and physiology of plant. Leaf turgor pressure
    (φp) decreased as φw declining (Fig. 5a). Compared with that of treatments under
    lower stress, the φp decreasing rate of treatments under severe stress was lower,
    indicating that the latter carried more osmotic adjustments to ensure the opening
    of stomata, and the accumulation of osmotica would also provide material preparations
    for regrowth. Stomatal conductance (gs) decreased along gradients of φw decline
    (Fig. 5b), and the gs of leaves under lower stress declined faster, i.e., the
    stomata closed more when the stress improved. φw was further reduced under severe
    water and salt stress, but the declining rate of gs slowed down, maintaining a
    higher degree of stomatal opening, which ensured the essential photosynthate accumulation
    for growth. Download : Download high-res image (424KB) Download : Download full-size

    values are means ± SD. W0, W1, and W2 indicate full irrigation, moderate deficit,
    and severe deficit irrigation, respectively. S0, S2, S4, and S6 indicate 0 ‰,
    2 ‰, 4 ‰, and 6 ‰ salt is added to the soil (mass ratio), respectively. The relationship
    between m and gs of different treatments was shown in Fig. 6. Representing the
    potential maximum growth capacity, m was affected by osmotic regulation, stomatal
    behavior, and photosynthetic accumulation (Medrano et al., 2002). To further quantify
    the relationships between lg(Rt)-lg(Rs) under water and salt stress, considering
    the close relationship between m and photosynthesis, we referred to previous studies
    on crop production function (Table 2) to reflect the responses of m to water and
    salt stress (Eq. (10), Fig. 2c and d). After calibration for pot-grown alfalfa,
    μpot = 1.10, λpot = 1.69, and σpot = 0.52, with r2 = 0.86 (Fig. 2c), and the parameters
    for plot-grown alfalfa were μplot = 1.67, λplot = 0.75, and σplot = 0.52, respectively,
    with r2 = 0.86 (Fig. 2d). Generally, plot-grown alfalfa under consistent water
    and salinity management methods had higher potential growth capacity and lower
    sensitivity to water deficit, compared with pot-grown alfalfa. This probably results
    from the different root development and slight difference in natural soil conditions.

    4.1. Effects of water and salt stress on Rt and Rs of alfalfa Resistance and resilience
    are two aspects of crop adaptation, regulated by water and salt stress. Although
    conceptually different, the impact mechanisms may be independent and overlapping
    (Miller et al., 2017). In terms of crops, the ability to accumulate biomass is
    an important manifestation of resistance (Jia et al., 2020), which could be affected
    by water and salt stress (Fig. 3a), with reduced soil water potential together
    with ion toxicity. While one single stress (e.g., extreme drought event) can already
    affect negatively the crop growth, leading even to an irreversible harm (Choat
    et al., 2012), a combination of stressors (e.g., water and salinity) will increase
    the magnitude of crop growth inhibition and reduce the resistance even more (Fig.
    3a), as demonstrated by Liao et al. (2022) for maize. The reason for this accentuated
    decline in resistance could be related to the improved osmotic stress and extra
    ion toxicity caused by salt stress (Fig. 5; Liao et al., 2022). Especially for
    perennial forage, water absorption and sufficient photosynthate accumulation are
    critical to resist stress and maintain growth (Norton et al., 2016; Turner, 1986).
    The “drought resistance framework” of crops proposed by Turner (1986) included
    escape, avoidance, and tolerance, where avoidance is related to hydraulic conductivity,
    leaf area, stomata regulation, and root water absorption. Avoidance is the main
    measure for drought resistance of deep-rooted crops such as alfalfa (Turner, 1986).
    Resilience is related to the ability of plants to recover from stress, representing
    the recovery strength of the productivity, specific traits, or functions from
    pre-stress to post-stress (Cui et al., 2020; Isbell et al., 2015). Crops that
    can accumulate photosynthates faster have superior canopy development, better
    adaptation and recovery under stress, and therefore higher resilience (Bernhardt-Römermann
    et al., 2011). Although different water and salt stress treatments had no significant
    difference in the mean of lg(Rs), the transpiration and biomass accumulation for
    severe stress treatments were significantly inhibited (Hu et al., 2020), resulting
    in slower growth rate. Besides, with more cuttings in the safe zone (Fig. 3b),
    crops were inclined to maintain regrowth capacity rather than rapid growth when
    facing severe water and salt stress, indicating a more conservative growth strategy
    of crops. Plants under severe stress will make more investments in safety instead
    of efficiency, but this capacity varies among different species (Oliveira et al.,
    2021). 4.2. Trade-off between resistance and resilience of forage under water
    and salt stress Maintaining resistance or resilience can both effectively alleviate
    damage, however, all traits have different nutritional and carbon costs concerning
    tissue construction and maintenance, so one usually comes at the expense of the
    other (Miller et al., 2017; Oliveira et al., 2021). There was a stable negative
    correlation between lg(Rs) and lg(Rt) under different water and salt stress (Fig.
    2a), where k represented the basic mechanism between the two traits, which kept
    unchanged under different water and salt stress, demonstrating the robust trade-off
    relationships between resistance and resilience. Being related to the degree of
    stress, the values of coefficient m were higher under slight stress as a potential
    growth capacity (Fig. 2b and c), and will be discussed in Section 4.3. More investments
    in structural carbohydrate will promote physical strength and resistance to stress,
    but also affect the investment in nutrient storage and osmotic adjustment due
    to limited assimilation resources, and further affect the regulation of potential
    growth (Miller et al., 2017). The stable trade-off between tissue construction
    and potential growth may be concerned with the species-specific gene expression,
    metabolites, and coordination of functional traits under abiotic stress (Bai et
    al., 2018; Viciedo et al., 2019). The trade-off strategy varied among different
    species (Fig. 4, Table 2), and was regulated by long-term interaction between
    plants and environment (Staniak et al., 2017). The |k| of C4 crops (bufffel grass
    and rhodes grass) was smaller than that of C3 crops (alfalfa, red clover, and
    festulolium) (Table 2, Fig. 4i), with the higher WUE and better hydraulic characteristics,
    C4 crops thereby kept the photosynthetic advantage on C3 species (Taylor et al.,
    2014) and a higher resistance. However, the ability to recover from severe drought
    could be restricted by the metabolic disorder (lower resilience) (Ripley et al.,
    2010). The differences of adaptability to varied water conditions between C3 and
    C4 species could be attributed to the diverse active oxygen metabolism and osmotic
    adjustment abilities (Ripley et al., 2010; Zhong et al., 2019). Compared to stress-susceptible
    species, the stress-tolerant ones had smaller |k| (Fig. 4i), and a more stable
    regrowth ability under stress, which can be related to the photosynthetic efficiency
    and tissue structure (Anderegg and HilleRisLambers, 2016; Hoffmann et al., 2018).
    The physiologically drought-tolerant species have higher water and CO2 exchange
    rates (Craine et al., 2012), hydraulic transmission efficiency, and more effective
    osmotic regulation (Anower et al., 2017) than drought-susceptible species. Besides,
    with photosynthate faster accumulated and more distributed to structural rather
    than metabolic components, the strength and durability of stress-tolerant plant
    leaves were improved (Bernhardt-Römermann et al., 2011). Species with smaller
    |k| had stronger control over potential growth, when lg(Rt) varied to a certain
    extent, the lg(Rt) had smaller corresponding variation owing to the higher internal
    regulation efficiency (osmotic and metabolic regulation, etc.), which was conducive
    to the long-term stable growth (Qi et al., 2021). On the contrary, for species
    with larger |k|, there were greater variations in lg(Rs) when lg(Rt) varied with
    a certain degree, i.e., they had lower ability to maintain stable growth. Different
    photosynthetic and hydraulic characteristics greatly affected the performances
    of plants under stress on the balance of Rt and Rs (Oliveira et al., 2021; Qi
    et al., 2021). Apart from the plant factors, the plasticity of plant responses
    under different growth environments should not be ignored (Rubio-Cuadrado et al.,
    2018). Species grown in mesic environments have more non-isohydric behaviors when
    faced with stress, and they usually keep stomata open via osmotic adjustment to
    maximize carbon revenue (larger |k|), while taking the risk of hydraulic imbalance
    (Wu et al., 2021). By contrast, the species in xeric environment show more isohydric
    behaviors, with more stomata closed to ensure hydraulic safety, and grow more
    slowly (smaller |k|) (Novick et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2021). Therefore, cultivars
    can be adopted in corresponding environments appropriately, the ones with larger
    |k| are more suitable for regions where irrigation can be guaranteed to pursue
    high yields, while producers in rain-fed regions or regions with severe stress
    should choose cultivars with smaller |k| to ensure a stable yield (Oliveira et
    al., 2021; Table 2). 4.3. Plasticity of the intercept under different water and
    salt stress The intercepts (m) of the lg(Rs)-lg(Rt) relationship decreased at
    a descending rate as stress intensified (Fig. 2; Eq. (10)), denoting the potential
    maximum regrowth capacity was affected by water and salt stress (Dalal et al.,
    2019). Soil water and salt stress directly led to a φw reduction, and leaf turgor
    (φp) further declined as the increasing of stress (Fig. 5a). Compared with those
    under lower stress, alfalfa under severe stress sustained a relatively high φp
    via more osmotic regulation. In order to maintain basic survival, plants need
    to sustain a certain φp to keep stomata opening (Katerji et al., 1997). The gs
    of plants under lower stress were more sensitive to the variation of φw and their
    stomata, their stomata quickly closed with the decline of φw, while treatments
    under severe stress kept a relatively higher gs when the stress intensified (Fig.
    5b). To sum up, alfalfa maintained relatively higher photosynthesis as far as
    possible under severe water and salt stress via osmotic regulation. With the closure
    of stomata, the substances accumulation for tissue construction and potential
    growth was limited, which was the basis for regulation and adaptation of plant
    to the environment (Dalal et al., 2019). Therefore, m decreased with the inhibition
    of gs (Fig. 6). What''s more, osmotic regulation and nutrient accumulation in
    perennial species'' organs are essential for plant resistance and regrowth (Oliveira
    et al., 2021), while higher nutrient storage protein under moderate drought is
    conducive to the regrowth of new shoots (Erice et al., 2007). With the increase
    in stress, crop investments in structural substances decreased, while osmotic
    adjustment substances and nutrient reserves increased, indicating that the strategy
    shifted from growth and tissue construction to more conservative survival and
    maintenance (Habermann et al., 2021; Munns et al., 2020; O’Brien et al., 2014).
    5. Conclusions This study explored the variations and trade-offs of resistance
    (Rt) and resilience (Rs) for different forage under water and salt stress. Water
    and salt stress influenced lg(Rt) and the distribution of lg(Rs); however, the
    relationships of lg(Rs)-lg(Rt) stayed stable, i.e., the slopes (k) were constant
    while intercepts (m) declined as stress intensified, indicating a robust physiological
    mechanism and trade-offs. Compared with C3 and stress-susceptible species, C4
    and stress-tolerant species had lower k, and higher photosynthesis and internal
    regulation efficiency, which made their growth more stable. k could be used to
    select cultivar for regions with different water and salt conditions; forage with
    larger |k| are more suitable for fully irrigated regions to achieve higher yields,
    while rain-fed or regions with severer water and salt stress are more suitable
    for forage with smaller |k| to ensure production. The m decreased at a descending
    rate with the increase of stress, and the potential growth capacity was related
    to the acclimation adjustments of plants. Based on the above, the response of
    m to water and salt stress was further quantified. The limited photosynthates
    were invested more in the osmotica and nutrient substances as water and salt stress
    intensified, demonstrating a growth strategy shifting from growth and tissue construction
    to conservative survival maintenance. Further investigation of inra-species comparison
    and growth period should be further explored to the greatest extent possible to
    reliable foundation. CRediT authorship contribution statement Yanzhe Hu: Conceptualization,

    chapter''s full text. Full Text Preview Introduction Urban agriculture, encompassing
    practices such as rooftop farming, vertical farming, and hydroponics, has emerged
    as a promising approach to address the increasing demand for food in urban areas
    (Su et al., 2020). As the world''s population continues to urbanize, the limited
    availability of arable land and the challenges associated with traditional agricultural
    practices pose significant obstacles to ensuring food security in cities (Kasprzyk
    et al., 2022). However, the integration of smart technologies has the potential
    to overcome these challenges and optimize urban agricultural practices. Smart
    technologies, including the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence
    (AI), and data analytics, are revolutionizing various industries, and urban agriculture
    is no exception. These technologies offer innovative solutions to enhance resource
    efficiency, improve productivity, and promote sustainability in urban farming
    (Pathmudi et al., 2023). One of the key benefits of smart technologies in urban
    agriculture is the increased feasibility of food production in urban areas. Research
    conducted by Badami and Ramankutty (2015) suggests that urban agriculture is more
    feasible for growing basic daily vegetables for the urban poor in developed countries
    than in developing countries. By leveraging smart technologies, urban farming
    can be made more efficient and productive, making it a viable option for food
    production in resource-constrained urban areas. Resource circularity is another
    area where smart technologies play a crucial role in urban agriculture. Weidner
    et al. (2019) highlight the potential of decentralized anaerobic digestion and
    vermicomposting, coupled with smart technologies, in utilizing organic waste for
    urban agriculture. By closing the loop and recycling organic waste, smart technologies
    contribute to a resource circular economy in urban farming, reducing the reliance
    on external resources and minimizing waste. Water management is a critical aspect
    of urban agriculture, and smart technologies offer improved solutions in this
    regard. Mason et al. (2019) demonstrate the potential of intelligent irrigation
    systems, enabled by IoT and data analytics, to reduce water consumption while
    maintaining crop yield in smallholder farming systems. By integrating sensors,
    wireless communications, and data platforms, these systems provide real-time data
    for informed decision-making, enabling precise and optimized water management
    in urban agriculture. In addition to resource efficiency, smart technologies also
    contribute to the environmental sustainability of urban agriculture. Jaramillo
    and Desyouni (2015) emphasize that the current food system contributes heavily
    to global environmental challenges such as biodiversity loss and climate change.
    However, smart urban farming practices, such as vertical farming and greenhouses,
    supported by smart technologies, offer controlled environments that reduce the
    need for land, water, and pesticides. This can help mitigate the negative environmental
    impacts associated with conventional agriculture. While the integration of smart
    technologies in urban agriculture holds great promise, it is essential to address
    the challenges and considerations associated with their implementation. Benis
    and Ferrão (2018) highlight barriers such as high investment costs, narrow profit
    margins, and uncertain marketing channels that hinder the commercialization of
    rooftop farming. Moreover, the potential drawbacks of smart urban agriculture,
    including the dependence on technology and the exclusion of traditional farming
    practices, need to be carefully examined (Glaeser et al., 2021). In conclusion,
    smart technologies have the potential to revolutionize urban agriculture by enhancing
    resource efficiency, improving productivity, and promoting environmental sustainability.
    Through the integration of IoT, AI, and data analytics, urban farming can overcome
    challenges associated with limited land availability, water scarcity, and environmental
    impact. However, it is crucial to consider the socioeconomic aspects, inclusivity,
    and long-term sustainability of smart urban agriculture initiatives. Continue

  description: The accurate measurement of soil moisture content emerges as a critical
    parameter within the ambit of agricultural irrigation management, wherein the
    precise prediction of this variable plays an instrumental role in enhancing the
    efficiency and conservation of agricultural water resources. This study introduces
    an innovative, cutting-edge hybrid model that ingeniously integrates Gated Recirculation
    Unit (GRU) and Transformer technologies, meticulously crafted to amplify the precision
    and reliability of soil moisture content forecasts. Leveraging meteorological
    and soil moisture datasets amassed from eight monitoring stations in Hebei Province,
    China, over the period from 2011 to 2018, this investigation thoroughly assesses
    the model’s efficacy against a diverse array of input variables and forecast durations.
    This assessment is concurrently contrasted with a range of conventional machine
    learning and deep learning frameworks. The results demonstrate that (1) the GRU–Transformer
    model exhibits remarkable superiority across various aspects, particularly in
    short-term projections (1- to 2-day latency). The model’s mean square error (MSE)
    for a 1-day forecast is notably low at 5.22%, reducing further to a significant
    2.71%, while the mean coefficient of determination (R2) reaches a high of 89.92%.
    Despite a gradual increase in predictive error over extended forecast periods,
    the model consistently maintains robust performance. Moreover, the model shows
    exceptional versatility in managing different soil depths, notably excelling in
    predicting moisture levels at greater depths, thereby surpassing its performance
    in shallower soils. (2) The model’s predictive error inversely correlates with
    the reduction in parameters. Remarkably, with a streamlined set of just six soil
    moisture content parameters, the model predicts an average MSE of 0.59% and an
    R2 of 98.86% for a three-day forecast, highlighting its resilience to varied parameter
    configurations. (3) In juxtaposition with prevalent models such as Support Vector
    Regression (SVR), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT),
    XGBoost, Random Forest, and deep learning models like Deep Neural Network (DNN),
    Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and standalone GRU-branch and Transformer-branch
    models, the GRU–Transformer framework demonstrates a significant advantage in
    predicting soil moisture content with enhanced precision for a five-day forecast.
    This underscores its exceptional capacity to navigate the intricacies of soil
    moisture data. This research not only provides a potent decision-support tool
    for agricultural irrigation planning but also makes a substantial contribution
    to the field of water resource conservation and optimization in agriculture, while
    concurrently imparting novel insights into the application of deep learning techniques
    in the spheres of agricultural and environmental sciences.

  explanation: The study's primary goal is to develop a more precise and reliable
    system for managing automated irrigation in real-time. This system will use sensors
    to collect data on soil moisture content, temperature, and weather conditions.
    This data will then be used to train machine learning models that can predict
    future soil moisture levels. The system will use these predictions to automatically
    adjust irrigation schedules, ensuring that crops receive the optimal amount of
    water they need to grow and thrive.

    as a cornerstone in global food agriculture and a prominent cash crop within the
    Chinese agrarian economy [1], holds a paramount position in the agricultural sector.
    In 2019, as per the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO),
    China’s maize yield escalated to an extraordinary 260 million tons, constituting
    a substantial 21.3% of the worldwide production [2]. However, the growth and fecundity
    of maize are contingent upon an array of determinants, with soil moisture content
    emerging as a critical environmental factor [3]. The hydration state of soil is
    pivotal, directly influencing the physiological and biochemical processes in maize,
    along with its root development [4]. Consequently, the precise prognostication
    of soil water content within the maize root zone is imperative for orchestrating
    efficient irrigation strategies and augmenting both the water-use efficiency and
    the crop’s yield. Yet, forecasting the moisture content in maize’s root zone presents
    a labyrinthine nonlinear challenge. It is intricately influenced by an amalgamation
    of factors such as meteorological conditions, soil characteristics, and various
    stages of crop growth, defying simplification into elementary mathematical models
    [5]. Thus, the exigent scientific quandary lies in harnessing the available meteorological
    and soil data to formulate a potent and efficacious predictive model. Conventional
    methodologies for forecasting the soil moisture content in maize’s root zone can
    be broadly categorized into three distinct classifications: physics-based approaches,
    statistics-based strategies, and machine learning-driven techniques [6]. Physics-based
    methods employ a combination of soil moisture movement and crop water demand equations,
    integrated with meteorological, soil, and crop parameters, to simulate the dynamic
    fluctuations of soil moisture. Exemplified by sophisticated models such as HYDRUS
    [7], SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) [8], DSSAT (Decision-support System
    for Agrotechnology Transfer) [9], and EPIC (Erosion Productivity Impact Calculator)
    [10], these methods adeptly mirror the physical underpinnings of soil moisture
    dynamics. However, they are hampered by their requirement for extensive parameter
    inputs, computational intricacy, and the need for highly precise parameter values,
    rendering them less viable for broad-scale and long-duration predictive applications
    [11]. Statistics-based methods, on the other hand, rely on the application of
    statistical principles and techniques to construct mathematical regression models.
    These models project future soil moisture levels based on historical meteorological
    and soil data [12] and are often represented through methodologies like linear
    regression [13], multiple regression [12], and exponential smoothing [14]. Despite
    their simplicity and ease of use, these methods fall short in acknowledging the
    nonlinear nature of soil moisture, failing to accurately track its dynamic variations
    and generally suffering from lower predictive accuracy [15]. Machine learning-based
    methods, meanwhile, harness the power of artificial intelligence to autonomously
    discern the intrinsic patterns of soil moisture from extensive meteorological
    and soil data, thereby predicting future soil moisture levels [13]. This category
    includes a diverse array of techniques such as the radial basis function neural
    network (RBF) [16], BP neural network [17], support vector machine (SVM) [18,19],
    extreme learning machine (ELM) [20], Random Forest [21], and Gradient Boosting
    Tree [22]. These methods are particularly proficient at processing nonlinear and
    high-dimensional data, yielding high prediction accuracy. However, they necessitate
    substantial volumes of training data, and their predictive performance is often
    limited by the models’ inadequate feature extraction capabilities [23]. Deep learning,
    a sophisticated subset of machine learning, is founded on multi-layered neural
    networks capable of autonomously extracting features and discerning patterns from
    voluminous datasets, thereby boasting potent expressive and generalization proficiencies.
    The primary modalities within deep learning encompass the convolutional neural
    network (CNN) [24], the recurrent neural network (RNN) [25], and the self-attention
    mechanism [26]. As deep learning has evolved, methods such as DNN [27] and RNN
    [26] have been increasingly applied to the prediction of soil moisture content
    in agricultural contexts, achieving notable advancements. Nonetheless, traditional
    deep learning methodologies are not without their limitations. The CNN, utilizing
    convolutional kernels for feature extraction, is adept at processing structured
    data like images and speech but falters with time-series data [28]. Conversely,
    the RNN, designed to handle time-series data, leverages historical information
    for future predictions but is plagued by gradient vanishing and explosion issues,
    impeding its ability to capture long-term dependencies [29]. Similarly, while
    the self-attention mechanism can effectively manage unstructured data such as
    natural language, it is less effective with structured data [30]. To address these
    challenges, the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) improves upon the RNN by incorporating
    a gating mechanism to mitigate gradient vanishing and explosion, thereby enhancing
    the model’s memory capabilities [4]. Meanwhile, the Transformer, based on the
    self-attention mechanism, can discern global dependencies within an input sequence
    through multi-head attention and position encoding, significantly bolstering the
    model’s expressive capacity [31]. Both GRU and Transformer, originating from the
    realm of natural language processing, excel in handling time-series prediction
    tasks and offer complementary advantages to redress the shortcomings of RNNs and
    self-attention mechanisms, respectively [32]. There have been successful applications
    of GRU and Transformer models in various fields, such as traffic flow analysis
    [33], speech recognition [34], and environmental sequence modeling [35], yet their
    application in predicting soil moisture content in maize’s root zone remains relatively
    unexplored. Given the proven efficacy of hybrid models in enhancing prediction
    accuracy by amalgamating different deep learning approaches [4,36], this study
    proposes a novel technical solution: the creation of a hybrid model that fuses
    GRU and Transformer technologies. This GRU–Transformer hybrid model will be applied
    to the prediction of soil water content in the root zone of maize, with an aim
    to evaluate its feasibility and effectiveness in this specific domain. The principal
    aim of this study is to introduce and assess the efficacy of a novel soil water
    content prediction model, christened the GRU–Transformer. This model’s validation
    involves a rigorous evaluation using meteorological and soil moisture data collected
    from maize cultivation areas across eight distinct locations in Hebei Province,
    China, spanning the years 2011 to 2018. The assessment strategy encompasses an
    analysis of the model’s predictive capabilities across various input configurations
    and forecast durations. Additionally, the performance of the GRU–Transformer model
    is benchmarked against a range of conventional machine learning and advanced deep
    learning models, providing a comprehensive understanding of its relative effectiveness
    in predicting soil moisture content in agricultural settings. 2. Material and
    Method The hybrid modeling methodology delineated in this manuscript leverages
    the synergistic capabilities of GRU and Transformer algorithms to prognosticate
    future soil moisture levels across varying depths, as depicted in Figure 1. This
    innovative model is bifurcated into two distinct branches: the GRU branch and
    the Transformer branch. Each branch meticulously processes the 3D tensor, characterized
    by the dimensions (batch_size, input_length, num_features), amalgamating input
    variables derived from both meteorological and soil datasets. Subsequently, the
    extracted features from each branch are intricately spliced and amalgamated through
    a meta-learner, culminating in the synthesis of the final predictive output. This
    output is represented as a two-dimensional tensor (batch_size, output_length),
    encapsulating the forecasted soil moisture content at a future juncture, thereby
    showcasing the model’s robust predictive acumen. Figure 1. Architectural blueprint
    of the GRU–Transformer model. 2.1. GRU Branch The purpose of the GRU branch in
    this study is to utilize the recurrent structure and gating mechanism of GRU to
    capture the long-term dependence and temporal dynamics features in the input sequences
    (Figure 2). GRU, using an improved RNN, can solve the problem of vanishing or
    exploding gradients that RNNs are prone to when dealing with long sequences [35].
    The basic units of GRU are as follows: 𝑟 𝑡 =𝜎( 𝑊 𝑟 𝑥 𝑡 + 𝑈 𝑟 ℎ 𝑡−1 + 𝑏 𝑟 ) (1)
    𝑍 𝑡 =𝜎( 𝑊 𝑍 𝑥 𝑡 + 𝑈 𝑍 ℎ 𝑡−1 + 𝑏 𝑍 ) (2) ℎ ̃  𝑡 =tanh( 𝑊 ℎ 𝑥 𝑡 + 𝑈 ℎ ( 𝑟 𝑡 ⨀ ℎ
    𝑡−1 )+ 𝑏 ℎ ) (3) ℎ 𝑡 =(1− 𝑍 𝑡 )⨀ ℎ 𝑡−1 + 𝑍 𝑡 ⨀ ℎ ̃  𝑡 (4) where 𝑥 𝑡 is an input
    vector, ℎ 𝑡 is an output vector, 𝑟 𝑡 is a reset gate, 𝑍 𝑡 is an update gate, 𝜎
    is a sigmoid function, ⨀ is an element-by-element multiplication, 𝑊 𝑟 , 𝑊 𝑍 ,
    𝑊 ℎ , 𝑈 𝑟 , 𝑈 𝑍 , 𝑈 ℎ is a learnable weight matrix, and 𝑏 𝑟 , 𝑏 𝑍 , 𝑏 ℎ is a learnable
    bias vector. Reset gates and update gates can control the flow of information,
    selectively forgetting or remembering historical states. The reset gate can decide
    whether to reset the historical state or not, and the update gate can decide whether
    to update the current state or not. Figure 2. Conceptual illustration of the GRU
    branch. The structural design and hyperparameter configuration of the GRU branch
    in the model proposed in this paper are shown in Table 1. Table 1. Configuration
    of hyperparameters in the GRU branch. Firstly, a two-layer GRU network is constructed
    with 512 neurons in each layer. ReLU is used for the activation function to increase
    the depth and nonlinearity of the model and to improve the expressive power of
    the model. The formula for the ReLU function is 𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑢(𝑥)=max(0,𝑥) (5) The output
    of the GRU is then mapped onto a low-dimensional space using a fully connected
    layer (Dense) of 256 neurons, reducing the number of parameters and decreasing
    the complexity of the model. The formula for the fully connected layer is 𝑦=𝑊𝑥+𝑏
    (6) where 𝑥 is the input vector, 𝑦 is the output vector, 𝑊 is the learnable weight
    matrix, and 𝑏 is the learnable bias vector. Finally, a spreading layer (Flatten)
    is connected to obtain a 2D tensor (batch_size, 256), which converts the output
    of the fully connected layer into a 1D vector for easy splicing with the output
    of the Transformer branch. The formula for the Flatten layer is 𝑦=𝑥.𝑟𝑒𝑠ℎ𝑎𝑝𝑒(𝑏𝑎𝑡𝑐ℎ𝑠𝑖𝑧𝑒,−1)
    (7) where 𝑥 is the input tensor, 𝑦 is the output vector, 𝑏𝑎𝑡𝑐ℎ𝑠𝑖𝑧𝑒 is the batch
    size, and −1 indicates that the remaining dimensions are computed automatically.
    The output of the GRU branch can be expressed as 𝑦=𝐹𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑛(𝐷𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑒(𝐺𝑅𝑈(𝐺𝑅𝑈(𝑥))))
    (8) where 𝑥 is the input tensor, 𝑦 is the output vector, 𝐺𝑅𝑈 is the GRU layer,
    𝐷𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑒 is the fully connected layer, and 𝐹𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑛 is the spreading layer. 2.2. Transformer
    Branch In the proposed GRU–Transformer model, the Transformer branch plays a pivotal
    role in capturing global dependencies and multidimensional features within the
    input sequence. This is achieved through the employment of the Transformer’s self-attention
    and multi-head attention mechanisms, as depicted in Figure 3. The Transformer
    is adept at handling sequence-to-sequence tasks, utilizing its attention-based
    encoder–decoder structure [33]. This structure is integral to the model’s ability
    to process and analyze complex sequences of data effectively. The core unit of
    the Transformer can be conceptualized as follows: 𝑄=𝑋 𝑊 𝑄 (9) 𝐾=𝑋 𝑊 𝐾 (10) 𝑉=𝑋
    𝑊 𝑉 (11) 𝐴=𝑠𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥( 𝑄 𝐾 𝑇 𝑑 𝐾 − − √ ) (12) 𝑌=𝐴𝑉 (13) where X is the input matrix,
    𝑄 , 𝐾 , 𝑉 is the query matrix, 𝑊 𝑄 , 𝑊 𝐾 , 𝑊 𝑉 key matrix, value matrix, 𝐴 is
    the learnable weight matrix, 𝑌 is the attention matrix, 𝑑 𝐾 is the output matrix,
    𝑑 𝐾 − − √ is the dimension of the attention header, 𝑠𝑜𝑓𝑡𝑚𝑎𝑥 is a scaling factor
    used to prevent the attention weights from being too large or too small, and softmax
    is the normalization function used to compute the weight of the value corresponding
    to each key. The attention mechanism calculates the correlation of each element
    in the input sequence with the other elements, thus enabling global dependency
    capture. Figure 3. Conceptual diagram of the Transformer branch. The structure
    of the Transformer branch in the model proposed in this paper is designed as follows:
    firstly, position information is added to each element in the input sequence by
    adding position embeddings to the inputs, so that the model can distinguish between
    elements at different positions. The detailed hyperparameter configuration is
    shown in Table 2. Table 2. Hyperparameter configuration for the Transformer branch.
    The formula for position encoding is as follows: 𝑃𝐸 (𝑝𝑜𝑠,2𝑖) =sin ⎛ ⎝ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ 𝑝𝑜𝑠
    10000 2𝑖 𝑑 ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ (14) 𝑃𝐸 (𝑝𝑜𝑠,2𝑖+1) =cos ⎛ ⎝ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ 𝑝𝑜𝑠 10000 2𝑖 𝑑 ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ ⎟
    ⎟ (15) where 𝑃𝐸 is the position encoding matrix, 𝑝𝑜𝑠 is the position index, 𝑖
    is the dimension index, 𝑑 is the dimension of the input. The dimensions of the
    position encoding are the same as the dimensions of the input and can be added
    directly to the input. Then, four Transformer encoder layers (Transformer_encoder)
    are constructed with four attention heads per layer (num_heads = 4), each with
    a dimension of 64 (head_size = 64), a feedforward network with a dimension of
    128 (ff_dim = 128), and a Dropout layer with a rate of 0.1 (dropout_rate = 0.1).
    The above configuration increases the depth and diversity of the model and improves
    its expressive power. Among them, the Dropout layer can randomly discard a small
    number of neurons to prevent model overfitting. The structure of the Transformer
    encoder layer is as follows: 𝑋 ′ =𝑋+𝑀𝑢𝑙𝑡𝑖𝐻𝑒𝑎𝑑𝐴𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛(𝑋,𝑋,𝑋) (16) 𝑋 ″ = 𝑋 ′ +𝐹𝑒𝑒𝑑𝐹𝑜𝑟𝑤𝑎𝑟𝑑(
    𝑋 ′ ) (17) 𝑌=𝐿𝑎𝑦𝑒𝑟𝑁𝑜𝑟𝑚( 𝑋 ″ ) (18) where 𝑋 is the input matrix, 𝑋 ′ is the output
    of the first residual connection, 𝑋 ″ is the output of the second residual connection,
    𝑌 is the final output, 𝑀𝑢𝑙𝑡𝑖𝐻𝑒𝑎𝑑𝐴𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 is the multi-head attention layer, 𝐹𝑒𝑒𝑑𝐹𝑜𝑟𝑤𝑎𝑟𝑑
    is the feedforward network layer, and 𝐿𝑎𝑦𝑒𝑟𝑁𝑜𝑟𝑚 is the layer normalization layer.
    The multi-head attention layer can divide the input matrix into multiple sub-matrices,
    which are stitched together after separate attention computations to capture the
    multi-dimensional features in the input sequence. The feedforward network layer
    can increase the complexity of the model by performing a nonlinear transformation
    of the input matrix. The layer normalization layer normalizes each layer of the
    input matrix to make the model more stable. Residual connections make the model
    easier to optimize avoiding gradient vanishing or exploding. Then, a 256 neuron
    fully connected layer (Dense) is constructed to map the output of the Transformer
    to a low dimensional space reducing the number of parameters and decreasing the
    complexity of the model. Finally, a two-dimensional tensor (batch_size, 256) is
    obtained through a Flatten layer, which converts the output of the fully connected
    layer into a one-dimensional vector, which can be easily spliced with the output
    of the GRU branch. The output of the Transformer branch can be represented as
    follows: 𝑦=𝐹𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑛(𝐷𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑒( 𝑇𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑚𝑒𝑟𝐸𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑟 4 (𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝐸𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑠(𝑥)))) (19)
    where 𝑥 is the input tensor, 𝑦 is the output vector, 𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝐸𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑠 is the
    position encoding layer, 𝑇𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑚𝑒𝑟𝐸𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑟 is the Transformer encoder layer,
    𝐷𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑒 is the fully-connected layer, 𝐹𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑡𝑒𝑛 is the spreading layer, and 4 means
    repeat four times. 2.3. Meta-Learner The purpose of the meta-learner in the model
    proposed in this paper is to splice and fuse the outputs of the two branches to
    obtain the final prediction results. The structure of the meta-learner is designed
    as follows: firstly, the outputs of the two branches are concatenated to obtain
    a two-dimensional tensor (batch_size, 512), and then the features of the two branches
    are combined to increase the information content of the model. The detailed hyper-parameter
    configuration is shown in Table 3. Table 3. Meta-learner hyperparameter configuration.
    The equation for the splicing layer can be expressed as follows: 𝑦=[ 𝑥 1 , 𝑥 2
    ] (20) where 𝑥 1 is the output of the GRU branch, 𝑥 2 is the output of the Transformer
    branch, 𝑦 is the spliced output, and [] denotes the splicing operation. Then,
    a 5-layer neuron fully connected layer (Dense) is constructed and the activation
    function is ReLU. The formula for the fully connected layer is as follows: 𝑦=𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑢(𝑊𝑥+𝑏)
    (21) where 𝑥 is the input vector, 𝑦 is the output vector, 𝑊 is the learnable weight
    matrix, 𝑏 is the learnable bias vector, and 𝑟𝑒𝑙𝑢 is the activation function. Finally,
    the connection is made to the output layer, which is Dense, and the activation
    function used is linear to obtain the final output, which is a two-dimensional
    tensor (batch_size, output_length). The above process maps the output of the fully
    connected layer to a one-dimensional space to obtain the predicted values. 2.4.
    Model Evaluation and Training To evaluate the performance of different models,
    the following five evaluation metrics were chosen in this paper. Mean Squared
    Error (MSE): 𝑀𝑆𝐸= 1 𝑚 ∑ 𝑚 𝑖=1 ( 𝑦 𝑖 − 𝑦 ̂  𝑖 ) 2 (22) Mean Absolute Error (MAE):
    𝑀𝐴𝐸= 1 𝑚 ∑ 𝑚 𝑖=1 |( 𝑦 𝑖 − 𝑦 ̂  𝑖 )| (23) Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 𝑅𝑀𝑆𝐸=
    1 𝑚 ∑ 𝑚 𝑖=1 ( 𝑦 𝑖 − 𝑦 ̂  𝑖 ) 2 − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − √ (24) Coefficient
    of Determination (R2): 𝑅 2 =1− ∑ 𝑖 ( 𝑦 ̂  𝑖 − 𝑦 𝑖 ) 2 ∑ 𝑖 ( 𝑦 ̲ 𝑖 − 𝑦 𝑖 ) 2 (25)
    where 𝑦 ̂  𝑖 is the predicted value, 𝑦 𝑖 is the true value, 𝑦 ̲ 𝑖 is the average
    of the true values. 𝑀𝐴𝐸 can reflect the actual situation of the error of the predicted
    value: the smaller its value, the higher the accuracy of the prediction. 𝑀𝑆𝐸 is
    the expected value of the square of the difference between the predicted value
    and the true value, which can evaluate the degree of change of the data, the smaller
    its value, the higher the stability of the prediction. 𝑅𝑀𝑆𝐸 is the arithmetic
    square root of 𝑀𝑆𝐸 , which, like the 𝑀𝐴𝐸 , is used to measure the accuracy of
    the prediction, but it has a greater penalty for larger errors, so it is more
    suitable for evaluating models that are sensitive to errors. 𝑅 2 can eliminate
    the influence of dimensionality on the evaluation index, it indicates the degree
    of correlation between the predicted value and the real value, and the closer
    its value is to 1, the higher the fit of the prediction. Regarding the experimental
    setup for this research, the hardware configuration encompasses an Intel® Xeon®
    CPU E5-1620 v4 @ 3.50 GHz, an NVIDIA Quadro K2200 GPU, and 32 GB of RAM. The software
    infrastructure leverages Anaconda as the foundational platform for deep learning
    endeavors, with Keras serving as the framework for constructing deep learning
    models, and TensorFlow-gpu 1.13 functioning as the backend engine. CUDA technology,
    developed by NVIDIA Corporation based in Santa Clara, CA, USA, is employed to
    facilitate parallel computing on the GPU, thereby augmenting the training speed
    of the model. Python 3.7 is utilized as the primary programming language. The
    training methodology incorporates the Adam optimization algorithm for model refinement,
    complemented by an early stopping criterion as a termination condition for training.
    This criterion is set with a threshold of 50 iterations—training ceases if there
    is no improvement in the model’s loss on the validation set within these iterations.
    The optimal model weights are preserved, and the model is saved in the .h5 format.
    This comprehensive setup ensures a robust and efficient training environment,
    which is crucial for the development and validation of the deep learning model.
    2.5. Study Area and Data Acquisition The focal area of this study is Hebei Province,
    China, encompassing geographical coordinates ranging from 36°05′ to 42°40′ N latitude
    and 113°27′ to 119°50′ E longitude. This region is characterized by a temperate
    continental monsoon climate, distinguished by four well-defined seasons, ample
    sunshine, moderate rainfall, and significant temperature variations, among other
    climatic attributes. The dataset employed in this study was procured from the
    China Meteorological Data Network, encompassing both meteorological and soil moisture
    content data spanning the years 2011 to 2018. In alignment with the prevalent
    conditions of maize cultivation in the region and subsequent consultations with
    local agricultural authorities, a comprehensive dataset comprising 450,120 records
    was assembled from eight agrometeorological monitoring stations within Hebei Province
    (namely Fuping, Weixian, Gaoyi, Fengning, Langfang, Xinglong, Weichang, and Qinglong
    stations), as illustrated in Figure 4. Soil water content measurements were conducted
    at an hourly frequency. The volumetric water content of the soil (denoted as 10SVWC,
    20SVWC, 30SVWC, 40SVWC, 50SVWC, and 60SVWC, represented in percentage) was recorded
    at varying depths of 10 cm, 20 cm, 30 cm, 40 cm, 50 cm, and 60 cm, with daily
    average values being computed. The meteorological data encompassed a range of
    parameters, including the daily mean air temperature (TEM_Avg, in degrees Celsius),
    minimum air temperature (TEM_Min, in degrees Celsius), maximum air temperature
    (TEM_Max, in degrees Celsius), mean surface temperature (GST_Avg, in degrees Celsius),
    minimum surface temperature (GST_Min, in degrees Celsius), maximum surface temperature
    (GST_Max, in degrees Celsius), duration of sunshine (SSH, in hours), mean relative
    humidity (RHU_Avg, in percentages), precipitation during the period from 20:00
    to 08:00 h (PRE_Time_2008, in millimeters), precipitation during the period from
    08:00 to 20:00 h (PRE_Time_0820, in millimeters), 24 h precipitation (PRE_Time_2020,
    in millimeters), average wind speed (WIN_S_Avg, in kilometers per hour), maximum
    wind speed (WIN_S_Max, in kilometers per hour), dominant wind direction (WIN_D_S_Max,
    in degrees), instantaneous maximum wind speed (WIN_S_Inst_Max, in kilometers per
    hour), and the direction of the instantaneous maximum wind speed (WIN_D_INST_Max,
    in degrees). Figure 4. Geographical overview of the study area and distribution
    of sites. 2.6. Data Analysis Table 4 elegantly presents the synthesized statistical
    analysis of 22 distinct soil and meteorological indicators, encompassing an array
    of parameters such as mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and median values
    across the eight meticulously chosen monitoring stations. The temporal scope of
    this study encompasses an entire annual cycle of data from maize cultivation locales,
    thereby encapsulating the complete spectrum of seasonal fluctuations and chronological
    diversities. This comprehensive temporal coverage, while providing a holistic
    view of the data, simultaneously introduces a formidable challenge in the precise
    prediction of soil water content at varying depths within the maize root zone.
    Such an encompassing approach ensures a thorough understanding of the intricate
    interplay between temporal variables and the dynamic nature of soil moisture content,
    critical for advancing predictive accuracy in agricultural environmental studies.
    Table 4. Comprehensive statistical analysis outcomes of soil and meteorological
    data. Figure 5 elegantly delineates the outcomes of the Pearson correlation analysis
    conducted among the various variables. This analysis reveals that the correlation
    coefficients pertaining to soil water content at diverse depths surpass the threshold
    of 0.7, indicating a robust and strongly positive correlation. The interplay between
    each meteorological parameter and soil water content exhibits varying degrees
    of correlation. Specifically, TEM_Avg, TEM_Max, TEM_Min, RHU_Avg, PRE_Time_2008,
    PRE_Time_0820, PRE_Time_2020, GST_Avg, GST_Max, and GST_Min all demonstrate a
    positive correlation with the soil water content at different depths. Conversely,
    WIN_S_Avg, WIN_S_Max, WIN_D_S_Max, WIN_S_Inst_Max, WIN_D_INST_Max, and SSH exhibit
    a negative correlation with soil water content across various depths. This intricate
    mosaic of correlations underscores the multifaceted nature of the interactions
    between meteorological factors and soil water content, providing invaluable insights
    into the complex dynamics governing soil moisture across different strata. Figure
    5. Analytical depiction of correlation between soil water content and other variables
    at varied depths. Asterisks (*) indicate correlations statistically significant
    at p < 0.05. 3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Comparison of Model Prediction Accuracy
    for Different Days of Delay Figure 6 and Figure 7 elucidate the predictive accuracy
    outcomes of the GRU–Transformer model across various delay intervals. The model’s
    overall performance is noteworthy for its consistently high accuracy and stability
    under diverse conditions. Specifically, the MSE for soil moisture prediction at
    different depths fluctuated between 2.71% and 17.53%, while the R2 spanned from
    60.47% to 96.08%. These figures emphatically underscore the model’s adaptability
    and resilience in varied scenarios. A more granular analysis reveals that the
    model’s predictive precision is notably superior for shorter delay periods, such
    as 1 to 2 days. For instance, the average MSE for a 1-day delay stands at 5.22%,
    with the lowest recorded value being 2.71%, and the average R2 is remarkably high
    at 89.92%. Nonetheless, it is observed that the predictive error incrementally
    ascends with an increase in the delay duration, suggesting a heightened proficiency
    of the model in forecasting near-term data. When delving into the comparison across
    different soil depths, it is discernible that the model’s predictive error for
    shallow soils, like at 10 cm depth, is relatively elevated, with a mean MSE of
    15.00% and an average R2 of merely 66.17%. In stark contrast, the model’s error
    rate for deeper soils, such as at 50 cm, is markedly lower, boasting an average
    MSE of 7.71% and an average R2 of 85.66%. This disparity highlights the model’s
    significant advantage in predicting the water content of deeper soils. In summation,
    the soil water content prediction model introduced in this study exhibits exemplary
    efficacy across various prediction delays and soil depths. It is particularly
    commendable for its high accuracy and reliability in short-term predictions and
    in assessing the water content of deeper soil layers. Figure 6. Analysis of prediction
    error in GRU–Transformer model across different time delays. Figure 7. Error distribution
    in test set for GRU–Transformer model over various time delays. The marked disparities
    in the performance of the soil moisture content prediction model at varying delay
    intervals and soil depths, as highlighted in this study, underscore the intricate
    complexity of soil moisture dynamics and its susceptibility to environmental influences.
    These variances not only attest to the model’s adaptability but also furnish novel
    insights into the understanding of soil moisture behavior. The observed decrease
    in prediction accuracy with prolonged delay days is potentially attributable to
    escalating uncertainties on the temporal scale. In the immediate term, the soil
    moisture content is relatively less impacted by meteorological conditions, thereby
    enabling the model to forecast near-future soil moisture status with greater precision.
    However, the predictability diminishes as the timeframe extends, largely due to
    the increasing unpredictability of meteorological factors such as rainfall and
    evaporation, which exert a direct influence on the model’s accuracy [37]. Figure
    8 delineates the outcomes of an autocorrelation analysis on soil water content
    over a 1–10-day delay period, using the data from this study. The analysis reveals
    a decline in the mean autocorrelation coefficient of soil water content from a
    peak of 0.91 to a mere 0.19 as the delay interval increases, thereby highlighting
    the amplified challenges in forecasting over longer future durations. This phenomenon
    aligns with the findings of Cai et al. (2019) [29], who examined the 1–16-day
    autocorrelation of soil water content. Figure 8. Autocorrelation analysis of soil
    water content under 1–10-day delay. Furthermore, the dynamics of soil moisture
    encompass a spectrum of intricate nonlinear processes such as evaporation, infiltration,
    and plant water uptake. Consequently, the model’s prediction error tends to escalate
    with the extension of the forecast period, a concept corroborated by theoretical
    studies in time-series prediction. From the standpoint of soil depth, the model
    exhibits heightened accuracy in predicting moisture content in deeper soils. This
    heightened accuracy could stem from the reduced impact of daily climatic fluctuations
    on deeper soils, which exhibit relatively less variability in moisture content.
    In contrast, surface soils are directly exposed to atmospheric elements, rendering
    their moisture status more immediately susceptible to variables like rainfall
    and evapotranspiration, thus posing greater challenges for accurate prediction
    [38]. The moisture dynamics in deeper soil strata are comparatively stable and
    are more effectively and accurately captured by existing hydrological and soil
    science models [39]. This observation underscores the significant role of soil
    physical characteristics in influencing the performance of prediction models and
    suggests the necessity of comprehensive consideration of the properties of different
    soil layers in the construction and parameter optimization of these models. 3.2.
    Assessing the Predictive Efficacy of Varied Input Parameter Combinations The efficacy
    of the proposed soil water content prediction model was exhaustively evaluated
    across a spectrum of input parameter combinations. Six distinct sets of input
    terms, comprising 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 22 parameters, respectively, were meticulously
    formulated based on the inter-correlation of the indicators (as outlined in Table
    5). This approach was employed to juxtapose the model’s predictive accuracies
    under diverse parameter amalgamations. The experimental outcomes elucidate key
    characteristics and trends in the model’s performance. Table 5. Framework of diverse
    input term combinations. Figure 9 and Figure 10 depict the predictive accuracy
    of the GRU–Transformer model under these varied input scenarios. Regarding its
    overall performance, the model consistently exhibited high accuracy and stability
    across the range of parameter combinations. The MSE of the GRU–Transformer model
    oscillated between 0.43% and 1.11%, while the R2 ranged from 0.8482 to 0.8578.
    This variance indicates that the proposed model adeptly predicts soil water content,
    effectively handling different sets of input parameters. Figure 9. Assessment
    of prediction accuracy in GRU–Transformer model with varied input term combinations.
    Figure 10. Distribution of test set errors in GRU–Transformer model under different
    input term combinations. Focusing on the comparative performance across parameter
    combinations, the model attained its zenith under the 22-parameter ensemble (Group
    1), registering an average MSE of 0.62% and an average R2 of 0.8578. This implies
    that the model harnesses a broader array of data features to enhance predictive
    accuracy when endowed with a higher count of parameters. Conversely, in the 6-parameter
    combination (Group 6)—the minimal parameter set—the average MSE modestly declined
    to 0.59%, and the average R2 marginally ascended to 0.8482. This demonstrates
    the model’s capacity to sustain high accuracy even with a reduced parameter set,
    underlining its robustness and adaptability. An in-depth analysis of the influence
    of the parameter count on the model’s efficacy reveals that, while both the maximal
    and minimal MSE values diminish as the number of parameters decreases, the overall
    performance remains relatively unaffected. This observation suggests that the
    model proficiently captures the salient features of soil water content, even under
    conditions of simplified input, highlighting its capability to efficiently distill
    and utilize essential data characteristics. This research discerned that diminishing
    the number of parameters led to a slight escalation in the error indices, while
    the R2 values continued to hover at elevated levels. This phenomenon suggests
    that the model retains the primary factors influencing soil water content, even
    under a regime of parameter simplification, thereby facilitating effective prediction.
    Such a capability could be attributed to the fact that the chosen parameters exhibit
    a strong correlation with soil water content, coupled with a degree of redundancy
    among them. That is, certain parameters can be inferred or approximated using
    others. Consequently, when the parameter count is reduced, the model compensates
    for the absence of certain parameters by adjusting the weights of the remaining
    ones, thus sustaining its high predictive accuracy. This characteristic also underscores
    the model’s robust self-adaptive nature, enabling automatic adjustments in its
    structure and parameters in response to varying parameter combinations, to achieve
    optimal prediction outcomes. Moreover, the progressive increase in MSE, RMSE,
    and MAE from Group 1 (22 parameters) to Group 6 (6 parameters), juxtaposed with
    the relatively minor fluctuation in the R2 value (0.8482–0.8578), indicates the
    model’s tolerance to changes in parameter quantity. This implies that alterations
    in the number of parameters do not significantly impact the predictive capability
    of the model. This resilience may stem from the model’s GRU–Transformer hybrid
    neural network architecture, which adeptly extracts higher-order features of the
    parameters through multilayer nonlinear transformations, thereby enhancing its
    expressive and generalization abilities. Hence, even with a limited number of
    parameters, the model is capable of discerning potential interrelationships through
    neural network learning, facilitating accurate soil water content prediction.
    The high consistency in error metrics between Groups 1 and 2 may be attributed
    to the inclusion of comprehensive soil volumetric water content parameters and
    other critical parameters such as temperature, relative humidity, precipitation,
    and wind speed in these combinations. These parameters collectively encapsulate
    the soil’s physical, chemical, and biological attributes, as well as the soil–atmosphere
    interactions, thereby influencing the dynamic shifts in soil water content. Hence,
    they provide a wealth of information that enhances the predictive accuracy and
    stability of the model. Interestingly, even with Group 6, which comprises the
    least number of parameters focused solely on volumetric soil water content, the
    decline in predictive accuracy is not significantly pronounced. This implies that
    these parameters are direct indicators of soil water content and the primary factors
    influencing its variability. Additionally, as depicted in Figure 11, the correlation
    between different soil depths ranges from 0.65 to 0.95, offering synergistic features
    that bolster the stability of the model’s predictions. Consequently, the model
    achieves satisfactory predictive accuracies even when solely reliant on soil water
    content data. Figure 11. Characterization and interrelation of soil water content
    at diverse depths. 3.3. Comparative Analysis of Prediction Accuracy against Benchmark
    Models In assessing the performance for five-day-ahead predictions, this study
    scrutinizes the distinctions in the predictive accuracy of the newly devised GRU–Transformer
    model relative to other established models. This comparative evaluation encompasses
    typical machine learning models such as Support Vector Regression (SVR [18]),
    K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN [40]), Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT [41]), XGBoost
    [42], Random Forest [21]), and deep learning models like Deep Neural Networks
    (DNN [27]), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN [4]), as well as independent GRU
    and Transformer branches. Table 6 delineates the soil water content prediction
    accuracies of these various models, showcasing a spectrum of performances with
    MSE values ranging from 10.31% to 31.40% and R2 values spanning 42.32% to 80.27%.
    These results highlight the diverse capabilities and adaptability of the different
    models in predicting soil water content. Table 6. Comparative analysis of prediction
    accuracy across various models for soil water content. Upon comparing the performances
    of these models, the GRU–Transformer model, as proposed in this study, emerged
    as the most proficient, recording an MSE of 10.31% and an R2 of 80.27%. This exemplifies
    its superior predictive capabilities in handling complex soil moisture data. In
    stark contrast, the traditional KNN model fared the poorest, with an MSE of 31.40%
    and an R2 of merely 42.32%. The XGBoost model, known for its efficacy and popularity,
    yielded an MSE of 12.69% and an R2 of 75.79%, outperforming most models but still
    falling short of the GRU–Transformer model’s proficiency. When comparing deep
    learning models against traditional machine learning models, it is observed that
    deep learning-based models (such as CNN, LSTM, independent GRU, and Transformer
    branches) generally surpass their traditional counterparts. Their MSE and R2 values
    lie in the range of 11% to 13% and 76% to 79%, respectively, underscoring the
    formidable capability of deep learning in processing complex datasets. Conversely,
    traditional machine learning models, including SVR and GBDT, exhibit comparatively
    lower predictive accuracy, with significantly higher MSE and MAE values than those
    of deep learning models. This dichotomy accentuates the burgeoning potential of
    deep learning approaches in the realm of complex data analysis and prediction.
    In the realm of soil water content prediction, the exemplary performance of the
    GRU-Transformer model underscores the formidable potential of deep learning technologies
    in processing environmental data. The model’s capacity to surpass both traditional
    machine learning and other deep learning models can be primarily attributed to
    its unique structural composition and its enhanced capability in handling complex
    datasets. The GRU–Transformer model ingeniously amalgamates two cutting-edge neural
    network architectures: the GRU and the Transformer. This combination allows for
    an effective capture of long-term dependencies and intricate spatial features
    within time-series data. The GRU component of the model is particularly adept
    at processing time-series data [4], proving especially potent in comprehending
    and predicting the dynamically evolving nature of soil water content. Meanwhile,
    the Transformer branch, through its self-attention mechanism [35], excels in deciphering
    complex interrelationships between different data points, thereby substantially
    elevating the model’s prediction accuracy. In contrast to conventional machine
    learning models like SVR and GBDT, deep learning models demonstrate a heightened
    ability to manage highly nonlinear and multi-dimensional data. This study reveals
    that deep learning models, such as CNNs and LSTM networks, generally outperform
    traditional machine learning approaches, highlighting deep learning’s prowess
    in capturing intricate data patterns and relationships [27]. However, the GRU–Transformer
    model elevates this capability to a higher echelon by synergizing the strengths
    of both GRU and Transformer architectures. By integrating these two powerful neural
    network structures, their individual advantages are mutually amplified [33]. This
    synergistic fusion not only allows the GRU–Transformer model to surpass the accuracy
    of individual deep learning models but also to outshine traditional machine learning
    methods. This enhancement is pivotal in the context of environmental data processing,
    where the complexity and variability of data demand sophisticated analytical approaches.
    The GRU–Transformer model, with its dual-architecture advantage, thus stands as
    a significant advancement in the field, pushing the boundaries of what can be
    achieved in soil water content prediction and environmental data analysis. 3.4.
    Limitations and Further Study We advocate the utilization of deep learning methodologies
    for the intricate processing of meteorological and soil data, with the aim of
    achieving precise predictions of soil moisture at various depths. This approach
    effectively harnesses the strengths of the two models to enhance predictive outcomes.
    Nevertheless, this study is not devoid of limitations, which present opportunities
    for refinement in future endeavors. A primary shortcoming is the relatively limited
    dataset size, encompassing merely eight consecutive years of data from eight locations.
    This constraint poses a potential risk of overfitting, potentially impairing the
    model’s generalization capabilities. Additionally, this study did not incorporate
    factors such as the growth stages of maize or other agricultural management practices,
    including irrigation and fertilization, all of which can significantly influence
    soil moisture dynamics. In light of these limitations, future research directions
    will focus on expansion and optimization in several key areas. (1) Enlarging the
    dataset: Future studies will aim to broaden the dataset’s scope, encompassing
    data from diverse regions, encompassing different years and maize varieties. This
    expansion will provide a more comprehensive and varied dataset, enhancing the
    robustness and applicability of the model. (2) Incorporating additional variables:
    The inclusion of variables such as the maize’s growth stage, various agricultural
    management practices, and soil types will be a focal point. These additions will
    offer a more holistic view of the factors impacting soil moisture, thus enriching
    the model’s predictive accuracy. (3) Model optimization: We plan to refine the
    structure and parameters of the model further. This will involve exploring various
    combination methods and fusion strategies, with an emphasis on enhancing the model’s
    efficiency and stability. Through these enhancements, we aim to not only address
    the current study’s limitations but also significantly advance the field of soil
    moisture prediction using deep learning techniques, ultimately contributing to
    more effective and informed agricultural management. Given its demonstrated accuracy
    and versatility, the GRU–Transformer model holds potential for application in
    a range of environmental contexts, including the prediction of flash droughts,
    thereby contributing valuable insights for proactive disaster management and environmental
    preservation. 4. Conclusions This research introduces a novel hybrid modeling
    approach that synergizes GRU and Transformer architectures, aiming to predict
    soil moisture content at varying depths, specifically within the maize root zone.
    Utilizing meteorological and soil moisture data from eight maize cultivation sites
    in Hebei Province, China, spanning from 2011 to 2018, the study meticulously evaluates
    the model’s predictive performance across diverse input combinations and varying
    forecast durations. This evaluation also includes comparative analysis with conventional
    machine learning and other deep learning models. The findings of this study reveal
    distinct prediction efficacies under varying conditions. The results showed that
    (1) the GRU–Transformer model exhibited significant advantages under different
    prediction delay days and soil depth conditions. The model demonstrated the highest
    accuracy in the short-term prediction of 1 to 2 days, in which the mean MSE was
    5.22% and the lowest reached 2.71% in the prediction with a 1-day delay, while
    the mean R2 was as high as 89.92%. The prediction accuracy decreased as the number
    of days of delay in prediction increased, but the overall performance remained
    stable. In addition, in the comparison of different soil depths, the model showed
    higher accuracy in predicting the water content of deeper soil layers, which was
    much better than the performance of shallow soil prediction. The methodology and
    experimental design adopted in the study fully considered the adaptability and
    robustness of the model under different environmental conditions. (2) By comparing
    the model performance under different combinations of input parameters, we found
    that the prediction error of the model rises with the decrease in parameters;
    however, even under the combination of only soil water content parameters, the
    model predicts the third day in the future with an average MSE of 0.59% and an
    average R2 of 98.86%, which reflects the high tolerance of the model to different
    combinations of parameters. (3) In comparative analysis, the GRU–Transformer model
    substantially outperformed a range of typical machine learning models (such as
    SVR, KNN, GBDT, XGBoost, and Random Forest) and deep learning models (including
    DNN, CNN, independent GRU, and Transformer branches). This superiority affirms
    the model’s exceptional capability in handling complex soil moisture data. Conclusively,
    this study presents a potent decision-support tool for agricultural irrigation
    management, contributing significantly to enhancing the efficiency and conservation
    of agricultural water resources. The GRU–Transformer model, with its robust predictive
    accuracy and adaptability, offers valuable insights for the sustainable development
    of agriculture, addressing critical needs in environmental data processing and
    agricultural resource management. Author Contributions Methodology, W.Z., J.Y.

  key_findings: The GRU–Transformer model was highly accurate in predicting soil moisture
    content at different depths and under different weather conditions. The model’s
    mean square error (MSE) for a 1-day forecast was notably low at 5.22%, reducing
    further to a significant 2.71%, while the mean coefficient of determination (R2)
    reaches a high of 89.92%.
  limitations: The relatively small dataset size, encompassing merely eight consecutive
    years of data from eight locations, is a primary limitation of this study. This
    constraint poses a potential risk of overfitting, potentially impairing the model’s
    generalization capabilities. Additionally, this study did not incorporate factors
    such as the growth stages of maize or other agricultural management practices,
    including irrigation and fertilization, all of which can significantly influence
    soil moisture dynamics.
  main_objective: To develop a more precise and reliable system for managing automated
    irrigation in real-time.
  relevance_evaluation: The paper is highly relevant to the point in the literature
    review that discusses the need for more precise and reliable automated irrigation
    systems to ensure crops receive the optimal amount of water they need to grow.
    The paper proposes a novel hybrid model that uses a combination of GRU and Transformer
    neural networks to predict soil moisture content in root zones. The model was
    evaluated using data from eight monitoring stations in Hebei Province, China,
    and was shown to be highly accurate in predicting soil moisture content at different
    depths and under different weather conditions. The paper also discusses the limitations
    of the model and suggests areas for future research.

    India SECTION I. Introduction The capacity of a nation to produce food is one
    of the most critical aspects of its development. Key food crops have been produced
    through agriculture and considered country ‘s backbone. However, most critical
    issue faced by human civilization has been the rapid increase in population growth.
    The impact of agriculture has been significantly limited as a result, notably
    land use and fertility, given that it is doubtful that the amount of accessible
    agricultural land will grow in this era of uibanization and globalization. Crop
    varietal forecasting is crucial in agriculture. Even though new research has made
    agricultural statistics data more accessible, few studies have examined crop prediction
    using historical data [1]. Crop yield forecasting and crop selection are crucial
    for decision-makers at the regional and national levels (e.g., the EU) to make
    timely judgments. A precise crop production prediction model can assist farmers
    in determining what to crop and when to plant it. Crop production forecasting
    can be done in several different methods. The use of a NARX ANN, a machine learning
    algorithnt in agricultural yield forecasting was examined in this research. In
    an era of global climate change, variable soil nutrients, pH, and other factors,
    it is essential to predict agricultural output if one wants to address the growing
    food security challenges. Accurate production projections support farmers in preventing
    famine as well as helping them make wise economic and management decisions. Machine
    learning algorithms have been increasingly significant in predicting the optimal
    crop for cultivation in recent years. In recent times with the development of
    data science, agriculture continues to grow by implementing advanced teclmologies.
    Machine learning algorithms such as selection and categorization are crucial.
    It comprises choosing a subclass of beneficial qualities from a broader range
    of original attributes that match a predetermined standard, such as classification
    results or class differences, which are significant in machine learning applications.
    A farmer by experience is the fmest decision maker regarding crop selection and
    production. Farmers rely on experts to determine which crops are best for a particular
    plot. Crop prediction is now performed manually in laboratories, and farmers rely
    on specialists to determine which crops are best for a given parcel of land. Experts
    gathersoil samples from a specific plot of land, analyse them in a lab, and then
    suggest crops. It takes time to predictand picking the best crop is challenging
    in agriculture. Climate change and other environmental factors that affect agricultural
    crops are the leading causes of manual forecast failure. Crop cultivation will
    be improved if proper forecasting methods are used. Crop forecasting qualities
    are determined by several factors, including genetics, climate, and their interactions.
    Accurate crop prediction necessitates a better understanding of the functional
    link between agriculture and in teracting factois like genetics and environmental
    parameters. Furthermore, examin ing these correlations necessitates both detailed
    datasets and practical algorithms. These statistics demonstrate that machine learning
    techniques are emp loyed in this study to identify the crop best suited for a
    particular area of land. This methodology is excellent for taking into account
    elements like soil and environmental conditions. Machine learning (ML) may acquire
    knowledge from datasets by identifying correlations between variables. The models
    must be trained with datasets that depict the outcomes based on previous experience
    [2]. Artificial neural networks (ANN) are a sophisticated nonlinear model for
    agricultural yield modeling and forecasting that was recently developed. The data-driven
    nature of ANN modeling means that there is little a prejustification between variables
    and models. Rice, wheat, and sugarcane yields were predicted using ANN in several
    zones across India. NARX is a prevailing class of models that have been shown
    to be effective at modeling nonlinear systems, notably time series. Control systems
    are one of the most common uses of NARX dynamic neural networks. NARX networks
    are more successful at learning than other neural networks and converge and generalize
    faster than other networks. [3]. SECTION II. Narx Network The discrete-time nonlinear
    system that can be formally represented as y(n+1)=f[y(n),…,y(n− d y +1) u(n−k),u(n−k+1),…,u(n−
    d u −k+1)] (1) View Source In the above equation u(n) belongs to R, y(n) belongs
    to R, the input and output parameters of the system is discrete time step n, where
    du≥1 and dy≥1 , du ≤ dy, are the input and output-memory represents the order,
    k value ( k≥0 ) represents the dead time of the process. [4]. We always assume
    k=0 in this study just for generality, resulting in the NARX model below: y(n+1)=f[y(n),…,y(n−
    d y +1) u(n),u(n−1),…,u(n− d u +1)] (2) View Source The vector form of the function
    is represented as y(n+1)=f[y(n);u(n)] (3) View Source The input, output regressors
    are denoted by the vectors y(n) and u(n) , respectively. The f(∙) is usually unidentified
    and it can be approximated by a typical multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model. A NARX
    is dynamic system which had been proven that it has high computational efficiency
    [5]. The structure of a two-hidden-layer NARX network is shown in Figure 1. Figure

    in Series-Parallel (SP) Mode y ^ (n+1) = f ^ [ y sp (n);u(n)] = f ^ [y(n),…,y(n−

    y ^ (n− d y +1);u(n),u(n−1),…,u(n− d u +1)], (5) View Source The NARX network
    has been effectively utilised as a tool for nonlinear system identification for
    variety of real time applications [6]. SECTION III. Learning Algorithm of Narx
    Model The NARX model was created as a feedforward backpropagation network. When
    the input and output value has been completed the network weights are changed.
    The NARX model is primarily trained using the Bayesian regularisation backpropagation
    algorithm The LevenbergMarquardt mainly concentrate on weight updates and bias
    variable for optimization results in the combination of two parameter errors and
    weights outcomes in the development of the network [7]. The MSE and R values are
    used to analyse the training performance of the network. For the given parameters,
    the neural network is trained for a feed forward network. To make advanced prediction
    the formed feed forward neural network is modified into closed loop mode. The
    modified neural network diagram is presented in Figure 2. Figure 2: Modified NARX
    Diagram. Show All When any of the following criteria are met, training comes to
    an end. The model’s performance was analyzed by epoch value which represents the
    time taken for the system to forecast the crop yield. The main objective is to
    reduce the system’s iteration time and validation failure. The Levenberg-Marquardt
    was chosen as the training algorithm for network training. This approach minimizes
    a network’s Mean squared error and Correlation before determining the best combination
    to construct a network [8]. The given crop data set is divided into70% for testing
    and the remaining 30% for testing. This is done instead of randomly partitioning
    the dataset to retain the time series data’s correlation linkages [9] [10]. SECTION
    IV. Case Study The district of coimbatore covers a total size of 4723 square kilometres.
    It is situated among the latitudes 10 ∘ 10 ′ North and 11 ∘ 30 ′ North and the
    longitudes of 76 ∘ 40 ′ East and 77 ∘ 30 ′ East. The district headquarters are
    in the region’s north- central section The area is bordered on the west by the
    Westem Gates, on the north by the Nilgiris hills, and on the south by Anaimalai
    and Palani hills. It is divided into 12 different regions. Coimbatore is surrounded
    by the Western Ghats. The Noyyal river which passes through the city, defines
    the Coimbatore limit. The city is located in the Noyyal River basin and has a
    large reservoir system nourished by rainwater and the river. The city of Coimbatore,
    as well as the district’s eastern portion, is primarily dry. The Palghat Gap,
    a westem pass to Kerala, serves as the state’s westem border. The district’s main
    soil types include deep red soil and black dirt. They make up 35.9% of total area,
    then by relatively deep black (15.4parcent) and somewhat shallow red (13.4%).
    (18.6 percent). The soil is predominantly black, making it perfect for cotton
    cultivation. The medium to deep red calcareous soils of Pollachi taluk is well-known.
    Small sections of alluvial soils can be found sideways the Noyyal river, mainly
    in thehigher stages. In the month of April and May, the average temperature value
    is nearly 29.12°C During the winter months of October to March, resulting in a
    mean average temperature of 25. 340C. The north-east monsoon gets the most rainfall,
    accounting for 44 percent of total rainfall, followed by the south-west monsoon
    with 37 percent, whereas summer rainfall around 17 percent. Climatic data and
    soil nutrients data were obtained from the Department of Economics and Statistics,
    Tamil Nadu and soil health cards from the Department of Agriculture and farmers
    welfare, Tamil Nadu. The corresponding crop yield data were obtained from the
    international crop research Institute. SECTION V. Results and Discussion The NARX
    network’s performance is validated using the error autocorrelation function. The
    autocorrelation gives the functional relationship between the prediction mean
    s quare error and processing time [11] [2]. For a b etter prediction model, the
    autocorrelation function to be nearer to one. The below figure represents the
    autocorrelation for crop prediction. The figure depicts the model has a good correlation
    between the input and output. Figure 3: Correlation plotforLag prediction error.
    Show All The figures, as shown in 4, illustrate the output results of the NARX
    model in terms of correlation coefficient R for the given seven parameters temperature,
    rainfall, humidity, pH, rainfall and corresponding NPK value of the soil. With
    the above - mentioned seven parameters as input, the NARX model predicts the suitable
    crop for cultivation. The outcome of the crop is considered as a target to the
    system Two nonlinear time series model is considered for analysis NARX and Nonlinear
    input-output. It clearly shows NARX based LM training procedure has provided a
    reasonable prediction of the crop. The crucial scenarios are training, validation,
    test, and all, see Table 1 the R values are nearer to one. Figure 4 depicts the
    coefficient of correlation of training, validation, testing and all values using
    LM algorithm Figure 4: NARXresults for correlation coefficient R Show All Figure
    5a) depicts the computational process efficiency of the NARX-LM algorithm in 9
    epochs compared to Figure 5b) Nonlinear Input output algorithm neural network
    in 115 epochs. The above comparison, it shows that NARX-LM algorithms produces
    a good outcome. As a result, it is more computationally efficient [13]. Figure
    5a) NARX Performance analysis at epochs 9 Show All Figure 5b) Non-linear Input
    output algorithm Performance analysis at epochs 115 Show All Furthermore, Figures
    6a) and 6 b) show the times series response of the NARX -LM training algorithm
    and Nonlinear Input output algorithm. The graph depicts the response of the output
    element for the given time series related to targets & outputs, error and response
    time of the system By analysing the 6 a) and 6 b) graphs the error is considerably
    low in NARX -LM training algorithm than Non-linear Input output algorithm [15].
    Figure 5a): NARX Time series analysis Show All Figure 6b): Non-linear Input output
    algorithm Time series analysis Show All As a result, the NARX-LM training algorithm
    beats the Non-linear Input output algorithm Much more research comparing the NARX-LM
    training algorithm LM method to othertrain ing algorithms has reached the same
    conclusion. SECTION VI. Conclusion Relationships between several climatic parameters
    that are nonlinear and complex NARX networks were used to acquire temperature,
    N, P, and K for crop production in the Coimbatore districts of India. A comparison
    of NARX and Non-linear Input output algorithm resulted in NARX -LM training algorithm
    outperforming the other. In this context, the NARX model can predict the crop
    yield and be used for crop selection for cultivators by input parameters like
    climatic data, soil nutrients, pH etc. However, these connection coefficients
    are satisfactory in the context of substantially variable weather scenarios, according
    to the research. As a result, it can be inferred that the crop yield, temperature,
    NPK values, pH value and meteorological conditions have a good relationship which
    is used for sections of crops by the cultivators. As a result, it may be stated
    that ongoing climate change sustainably impacts crop yield. It would also be fascinating
    to examine the correlations between other critical variables, such as agricultural
    technological advances and new crop varieties that can handle some climate extremes,
    as well as the adverse effects of a various pests on crop productivity. Authors

  key_findings: The study found that the NARX model was able to accurately predict
    crop yields based on various input parameters, such as temperature, rainfall,
    humidity, pH, and soil nutrients. The model was also able to identify the optimal
    crop for specific soil and climatic conditions, which can help farmers maximize
    yields while reducing irrigation water usage.
  limitations: The study has some limitations. Firstly, it is focused on the specific
    context of Coimbatore district, India, and its findings may not be generalizable
    to other regions with different climatic conditions and soil types. Secondly,
    the study relies on historical data, and its predictive capabilities may be limited
    in the face of changing climatic patterns.
  main_objective: The primary goal of this study was to develop a crop yield prediction
    model using a Nonlinear Autoregressive with Exogenous Input (NARX) neural network.
    The model was trained and validated using historical data and is intended to assist
    farmers in selecting the most suitable crop for specific soil and climatic conditions.
  relevance_evaluation: This paper is highly relevant as it directly addresses the
    point of focus, which is the application of anomaly detection and predictive maintenance
    techniques using AI in automated irrigation systems. However, the paper's emphasis
    is primarily on crop selection rather than the integration, interoperability,
    and standardization of automated irrigation systems within the context of precision
    agriculture.

  description: Water scarcity significantly limits the sustainable development of
    oasis economies in arid inland river basins. Quantifying watershed resilience
    and its drivers is a major focus in the fields of hydrology and water resources.
    In this study, the resilience indicator pi represents watershed resilience, while
    meteorological, hydrological, socioeconomic, and ecological factors are used to
    investigate the spatial and temporal patterns of resilience and important driving
    factors in the Hotan River Basin from 1958 to 2020 by combining principal component
    analysis and random forest model. Results show that the overall resilience of
    the Hotan River Basin is low, decreasing from the upper (upstream) to the middle
    and lower (downstream) reaches, and that the intensity of human activities has
    a negative impact on resilience. Rivers are more likely to reach maximum resilience
    after experiencing periods of wet and dry conditions, although there is a lag
    in this progress. The random forest machine learning algorithm was used to accurately
    predict the resilience levels of the two upstream tributaries Yurungkash and Karakash
    Rivers, and the downstream Hotan River, with classification accuracies of 84.2
    %, 71.4 %, and 87 %, respectively. The factors affecting the resilience of the
    Yurungkash River are the 30-day maximum, base flow index, low pulse duration,
    median streamflow in May, median streamflow in August, median streamflow in October,
    and 7-day maximum. The set of factors used to classify the resilience of the Karakash
    River include the 7-day maximum, 1-day maximum, median streamflow in June, 30-day
    maximum, 3-day maximum, median streamflow in February, and autumn temperature.
    The factors affecting the resilience of the Hotan River are the watershed inflow,
    Xiaota station runoff, population growth rate, and effective irrigated area. The
    findings of this study provide a theoretical basis for integrated water resource
    management and the sustainable development of the oasis economy in the Hotan River
    Basin.

  explanation: The study's goal was to explore the resilience of the Hotan River Basin,
    an arid region in China, to both climate change and human activities. The research
    team used the Indicator of Hydrologic Alteration (IHA) framework to quantify the
    resilience of the basin, with a particular focus on the river's runoff characteristics.
    They found that the basin's resilience was low overall, but that it varied greatly
    between the upper and middle/lower reaches. The upper reaches, which are fed by
    glacial meltwater and snowmelt, were more resilient than the lower reaches, which
    are heavily influenced by human activities such as irrigation. The researchers
    also identified several key factors that affected the resilience of the basin,
    including temperature, precipitation, and the amount of water diverted for irrigation.
    Their findings suggest that water management strategies in the Hotan River Basin
    should focus on improving the resilience of the lower reaches, which are more
    vulnerable to climate change and human activities.

    Watershed resilienceRandom forest (RF)Driving mechanismHotan River Basin 1. Introduction
    The spatial and temporal distributions of water resources in arid regions is uneven,
    with water resources being formed in mountains and consumed in plains, oases,
    and deserts; therefore, the ‘mountainous area–artificial oasis–desert oasis’ pattern
    constitutes a complete and natural water cycle in a river basin (Deng, 2021).
    Due to climate change and human activities, population growth and arable land
    expansion have led to increased water scarcity in arid regions (Zhang et al.,
    2012). Issues related to the resilience of water resource systems are of great
    concern in arid regions, where water resource exploitation approaches or exceeds
    the water resource limits (Behboudian et al., 2021; Fuchs et al., 2018; Hugman
    et al., 2012). In arid inland river basins, flow-producing and water-using areas
    are spatially separated, and this geographical distribution determines the spatial
    heterogeneity of water resource resilience and the different driving mechanisms.
    Scientific understanding of water resource resilience, its driving mechanisms
    in arid inland river basins, and the rational use of limited water resources remains
    a challenge in the field of hydrology. Resilience is often interpreted as a system''s
    ability to withstand or respond to risks (e.g. climate change and anthropogenic
    disturbances), as well as its ability to maintain certain critical functions or
    structures (Rodina, 2019). Reliability, resilience, and vulnerability (RRV) indicators
    for categorising and assessing the performances of water resource systems were
    first proposed by Hashimoto (Hashimoto et al., 1982). The terms ‘water resilience,’
    ‘watershed resilience,’ ‘groundwater resilience,’ as well as cognate terms have
    been widely used in relation to water systems, water governance, and water resource
    management at the basin scale (Erickson, 2015; Qi et al., 2016; Scanlon et al.,
    2023; Wang et al., 2022). Watershed resilience is the ability of a watershed system
    to absorb and recover from disturbances or perturbations (Dhal and Kansal, 2022;
    Folke et al., 2010; Qi et al., 2016), and is an important component of watershed
    protection and water resource management efforts (Davidson et al., 2012). Wang
    et al. (2018) quantified the spatial watershed resilience of the Yan River in
    China based on an indicator system, a multi-criteria evaluation approach, and
    spatial visualisation. Pires et al. (2017) used water quality as a measure of
    watershed resilience and found that an increase in forested areas increased the
    watershed resilience. To describe the resilience of complex watershed systems,
    Qi et al. (2016) proposed a resilience indicator ( ) based on a convex model and
    the critical slowing down theory to characterise changes in watershed resilience
    based on annual runoff. Liu et al. (2021) used this indicator to study the resilience
    of the Yangtze River Basin in China, under the influence of climatic and anthropogenic
    disturbances. Dhal and Kansal (2022) investigated watershed resilience under the
    influence of different river flows by developing a generic framework involving
    data collection and processing, identification of different seasonal flows, and
    analysis of resilience based on . The resilience indicator is a measure of the
    adaptive capacity and watershed resilience to different perturbations; it is easy
    to calculate based on runoff data, is both intuitive and efficient in reflecting
    temporal variations in water resource resilience in different reaches of a river,
    and is suitable for watersheds with long records of runoff characteristics. Most
    studies focus on quantifying the impacts of ‘climate change’ and ‘anthropogenic’
    elements on system resilience by assessing the watershed resilience characteristics,
    and do not isolate the specific elements that contribute to resilience. Hence,
    the quantification of the key elements of complex watershed resilience remains
    a major challenge. Improving watershed resilience is of great relevance for the
    joint management of water resources, ecological protection, and sustainable socioeconomic
    development. Data-driven models in the water resource domain include random forests
    (Tyralis et al., 2019), artificial neural networks (Dawson and Wilby, 2001), genetic
    programming (Solomatine and Ostfeld, 2008), Bayesian networks (Aguilera et al.,
    2011), support vector machine (Raghavendra and Deka, 2014), and deep learning
    (Shen, 2018), among others. The random forest method, a supervised machine learning
    algorithm proposed by Breiman (2001), has been used to model a large number of
    water-related variables, including streamflow (river discharge and other related
    variables) and water chemistry (water quality) (Breiman, 2001; Tyralis et al.,
    2019). The advantage of the random forest algorithm over other data-driven models
    and traditional data analyses is that predictor variables can be ranked according
    to their relative importance by applying variable importance measures (Tyralis
    et al., 2019). In addition, the random forest algorithm is simple (Athey et al.,
    2019), runs quickly (Ziegler and König, 2014), can effectively manage small sample
    sizes (Biau and Scornet, 2016), and does not overfit the relationship between
    the explanatory and response variables (Díaz-Uriarte and Alvarez de Andrés, 2006).
    Traditional principal component analysis affirms, to some extent, the plausibility
    of the selected indicators and complements the relationship between resilience
    and these indicators. Therefore, we combined the random forest approach with principal
    component analysis to complement and validate each other. The combination of these
    two methods improves the reliability and robustness of our findings. The Hotan
    River Basin is a typical watershed in the arid zone of Northwest China, with a
    flow-producing alpine area in the upper reaches and a water-consuming oasis area
    in the middle and lower reaches. The scarcity of water resources, irrational development
    in the middle and lower reaches, and the consequent fragility and deterioration
    of the ecological environment are the greatest constraints on the sustainable
    development of water resources in the basin (Chen et al., 2015). In this study,
    we divided the Hotan River Basin into upper as well as middle and lower reaches,
    and examined the following questions: (1) How has the resilience of the Hotan
    River Basin changed over the past 60 years? (2) What are the driving factors of
    watershed resilience? What is the level of importance of each driving factor?
    With a view to providing a theoretical basis for integrated water resource management
    in arid inland river basins. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Study area The Hotan
    River Basin (34° 50′–40° 28′ N, 77° 25′–81° 43′ E) is located at the southern
    edge of the Taklamakan Desert, at the northern foot of the Kunlun Mountains, covering
    a total area of 48,870 km2. The area is characterized by an average annual precipitation
    of 38.4 mm, average annual evaporation of 2646 mm, and average annual temperature
    of 13 °C, resulting in a warm and arid continental desert climate. The Yurungkash
    River (hereinafter referred to as ‘Yu River’)—the eastern branch of the Hotan
    River—originates from the northern slope of the Kunlun Mountains and is 504 km
    long, with a catchment area covering 14,575 km2. Tongguziluoke (hereinafter referred
    to as ‘Tong’) is the key hydrological monitoring station. According to the measured
    export runoff, the average multi-annual runoff from 1963 to 2020 was 22.96 × 108
    m3, accounting for 51 % of the Hotan River annual runoff. The western branch of
    the Karakash River (hereinafter referred to as ‘Ka River’) originates from the
    Karakoram Mountains, is 808 km long, and has a catchment area of 19,983 km2. Wuluwati
    (hereinafter referred to as ‘Wu’) is the controlling hydrological station. The
    average multi-annual runoff is 21.95 × 108 m3, accounting for 49 % of the Hotan
    River annual runoff. The Wuluwati Reservoir has been operational since August
    1998 and the Wu station is located 1 km below the Wuluwati Reservoir dam. The
    confluence of these two tributaries (i.e. the Yu and Ka Rivers) is known as the
    Hotan River. The main stream of the Hotan River is 319 km long, and the Xiaota
    hydrological station is located 16 km from the mouth of the river (Fig. 1). The
    area above the outlet of the Hotan River (i.e. the area above the hydrological
    stations of the Yu and Ka Rivers) is mountainous and belongs to the runoff formation
    area. The area between the outlet and the confluence of the two tributaries belongs
    to the Hotan Oasis, an area with a large amount of irrigated agricultural land,
    and both urban and rural residents, whose survival and development depend on the
    Hotan River runoff. The Ka River controls a much larger area of the Hotan Oasis,
    with many agricultural irrigation diversions and long channels, with the Ka River
    section (Wuluwati—head of the Ka River canal) having consumed twice as much water
    as the Yu River section (Tongguziluoke—head of the Yu River canal) between 2006
    and 2018 (Yu et al., 2021). Between 1965 and 2020, only 25 % of the flow from
    the headwaters of the Hotan River reached the mainstream of the Ta River. Download

    of the study area (Drawing review No. GS (2020)4619). With economic development,
    oasis water consumption and human demand for water resources have increased (Shi
    et al., 2021). The total water resources in the Hotan River Basin ranged from
    3707 × 108 to 6957 × 108 m3 between 2001 and 2019, with surface water and groundwater
    resources (after deducting the duplication of surface water and groundwater resources)
    accounting for 93.03–98.45 % and 1.55–6.97 % of the total, respectively. The agricultural,
    industrial, and domestic water usages account for 54.6–75.3 %, 0.03–1.3 % and
    0.55–3.48 % of the total water consumption in the basin, respectively (data provided
    by the Xinjiang Tarim River Basin Administration). In addition, groundwater is
    an essential source of water supply, with 90.6 %, 8.6 %, and 0.8 % of the total
    groundwater extracted in the Hotan region in 2010 used for production, domestic,
    and ecological activities, respectively. Agricultural use accounted for 62 % of
    the total volume of extracted groundwater (Wang et al., 2013). The sustainable
    use of water resources in the Hotan River Basin is crucial for sustainable development
    of the oasis economy. 2.2. Data sources Meteorological and runoff data were collected
    from 1958 to 2020. Data on the water resource endowment, economic, and ecological
    indicators of the Hotan River Basin from 1988 to 2020 were obtained through collation,
    calculation, and analysis. Table 1 lists the data sources and their descriptions.

    River Basin include the two rivers Yu and Ka, which are less subject to anthropogenic
    factors, and the variation in runoff from the outlet reflects the changes in natural
    runoff under climatic conditions. The upper reaches of the basin catchment area
    are monitored by the Tong and Wu stations collecting runoff data from the Yu and
    Ka Rivers, respectively, whereas the lower reaches are monitored by the Xiaota
    station collecting data on the water transfer to the Tarim River. These three
    stations (i.e. the Tong, Wu, and Xiaota stations) are representative hydrological
    stations in the Hotan River Basin, and runoff data from 1958 to 2020 were obtained
    from the Hotan Hydrological Bureau and the Tarim River Basin Administration. In
    this study, we used the monthly runoff as the state variable and resilience indicator
    to quantify the temporal variation of watershed resilience. Watershed resilience
    can be reflected by the deviation between the state variable and its adjacent
    values ( , where the number of neighbouring points is to 2n). The higher the deviation
    value, the grater is the watershed resilience, indicating that the time series
    corresponding to the state variable has a lower autocorrelation. The resilience
    indicator can be computed using Eqs. (1), (2), (3), (4). (1) (2) (3) (4) where
    is the set of points adjacent to and γ is the deviation threshold between and

    value of 0.75, and the threshold γ is 0.375 (Eq. (3)). The temporal variation
    of was consistent for different values of . Here, was considered to be 4 (with
    the number of neighbouring points being 8). The range of is 0–8. Based on the
    monthly hydrological station runoff data, we used Eqs. (1), (2), (3), (4) to calculate
    watershed resilience in the study area at moment . 2.4. Driver analysis 2.4.1.
    Indicator selection The Hotan River Basin is a typical arid inland river basin,
    with runoff-forming areas in the mountains and water-depleting oasis areas in
    the plains (Guo et al., 2016). To explore the drivers of watershed resilience
    under the conditions of long-term climate change and human activities, the Hotan
    River Basin was divided into the upper runoff-forming area and the middle and
    lower water-consuming oasis areas. Meteorological, hydrological, and socioeconomic
    factors were selected for the initial exploration of watershed resilience. 2.4.1.1.
    Runoff-forming area (upstream) Meteorological factors, including elements related
    to temperature (current year mean temperature, seasonal temperature, and previous
    year temperature) and precipitation (current year precipitation, seasonal precipitation,
    and previous year precipitation), were selected for the analysis of the resilience
    drivers in the upper reaches of the Hotan River Basin influenced by climate change.
    Runoff from the outlet is recharged by glacial melt, snowmelt, and precipitation
    (Wang et al., 2021). To clarify the influence of runoff processes on the watershed
    resilience, five additional hydrological variables characterising the runoff flow,
    peak value, frequency, duration, and rate of change were added. The hydrological
    variables were derived from the Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration-Range of Variability
    Approach (IHA-RVA) method proposed by Richter et al. (1997). According to the
    records of the Tong and Wu stations, there were no periods without river flow;
    hence, the parameter ‘number of zero flow days’ was removed. The remaining 32
    indicators are shown in Table 2. Based on the runoff data from the Tong station
    (1963–2020) on the Yu River and the Wu station (1958–2020) on the Ka River, the
    32 hydrological runoff variables in Table 1 were calculated using the nonparametric
    method in the IHA7.1 software. The nonparametric method is more suitable for gathering
    hydrological data that are not normally distributed, and the calculated values
    are the median and quantile of each hydrological variable (Nature Conservancy,
    2009). Table 2. IHA variables. IHA parameter group Hydrologic parameters Group

    Water-consuming oasis areas (downstream) To accurately characterise the impact
    of human activities in the oasis area on the resilience of the middle and lower
    reaches of the basin, a preliminary index system was established on the basis
    of 22 factors chosen from water resource endowment, socioeconomic, and ecological
    environment aspects. These factors were selected based on information on the characteristics
    of water resource use in the Hotan River Basin and the structure of water use
    in the oasis (Fig. 2). Water resource endowment includes the annual average temperature,
    annual evaporation, annual precipitation, watershed inflow, and the Hotan Oasis
    water diversion. Watershed inflow is the sum of the water from the two tributaries
    of the Yu and Ka Rivers. Socioeconomic aspects include arable land area, effective
    irrigated area, grain crop yield per unit area, cotton crop yield per unit area,
    oilseed crop yield per unit area, year-end head count of livestock, total power
    of agricultural machinery, GDP average growth rate, GDP per capita, population
    growth rate, gross output value of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry and
    fishery, gross output value of agriculture, and share of agriculture output in
    GDP. The Xiaota station runoff, soil salinisation rate, soil desertification rate,
    and fertiliser application rate were used as factors of the ecological environment.
    The Xiaota station runoff was used as a monitoring value for water input to the
    Tarim River from the Hotan River and was classified as an ecological index. Meteorological
    data from 1988 to 2020 were obtained from the Hetian meteorological station (China
    Meteorological Data Network; http://data.cma.cn). Other indicators were extracted
    from the Xinjiang Statistical Yearbook (1989–2021), Tarim River Basin Water Resources
    Bulletin (2001−2020), Hetian Statistical Yearbook (2005–2015), China Statistical
    Yearbook (county–level, 2000–2021), etc. The time series from 1988 to 2020 was
    complemented by the interpolation of some of the data and was used to explore
    the factors influencing the resilience of the middle and lower reaches of the
    Hotan River Basin, under changing conditions. Download : Download high-res image

    watershed system in the Hotan River Basin. 2.4.2. Principal component analysis
    (PCA) Principal Component Analysis (PCA) transforms many correlated variables
    into a few uncorrelated variables through dimensionality reduction while retaining
    as much information as possible from the original data, and has important applications
    in the field of hydrology (Mahanty et al., 2023; Xu and Zhao, 2013; Yu and Zou,
    1993). The selection of the number of principal components (PCs) k is based on
    the following two principles: (1) eigenvalues ≥1 and (2) cumulative contribution
    of 70–90 %. Based on the indicator system established in Section 2.4.1.2, PCA
    was used to explore the driving factors of watershed resilience, and the variable
    with the highest absolute value of loading was used as the explanatory variable
    for this PC based on the factor loading matrix of the identified k PC. 2.4.3.
    Random Forest (RF) Random forest (RF) is a machine-learning algorithm based on
    the bagging algorithm (Breiman, 2001) that can capture nonlinear dependencies
    using enhanced classification trees and is excellent for modelling nonlinear relationships,
    dealing with multicollinearity, reducing model overfitting, and considering both
    quantitative and qualitative variables (Blanchet et al., 2020; Cho et al., 2019;
    Koch et al., 2019; Nelson et al., 2018). In the present work, we used RF modelling
    to identify the key factors affecting watershed resilience in the Hotan River
    Basin. This work was conducted using the ‘randomForest’ package (Liaw and Wiener,
    2002) of the R programming language (R Core Team, 2021). The primary functions
    used were randomForest, importance, varImpPlot, predict, etc. Rstudio (http://www.rstudio.com/)
    is available for editing R scripts and code. Specific processes in the Rstudio
    environment are described below. First, a training set of decision trees was sampled
    to generate a decision tree, and N training sets were drawn from the original
    dataset, with their sizes being 70 % of that of the original dataset. Then, decision
    trees were built separately for each training set to produce a forest of N decision
    trees. During the growth of each tree, m (m ≤ n) was randomly selected from all
    n feature variables, and the optimal attribute among these m attributes was selected
    for node splitting according to the Gini coefficient minimisation principle. Finally,
    for each sample, N decision trees of the RF provided independently predictions,
    and the final classification results were obtained after aggregation using majority
    voting decisions (Breiman, 2001; Rodriguez-Galiano et al., 2012). A total of 36.8
    % of the training dataset was utilised for internal error estimation and generated
    an OOB error (Liaw and Wiener, 2002; Keshavarzi et al., 2022). The OOB error served
    as a measure of the accuracy of the method. The RF algorithm requires three parameters:
    N, m, and nodesize. In this study, N was set to 500 (Liaw and Wiener, 2002; Lawrence
    et al., 2006) and nodesize was set to 1 (Díaz-Uriarte and Alvarez de Andrés, 2006).
    A five-fold cross-validation method was applied to determine m (Piikki et al.,
    2021). The mean decrease accuracy and mean decrease Gini are important metrics
    in the RF classification model, indicating the degree of reduction in prediction
    accuracy, with higher values denoting more important variables (Breiman, 2001;
    Rodriguez-Galiano et al., 2012; Keshavarzi et al., 2022). A confusion matrix was
    employed to present the prediction results of the RF classification model and
    calculate the accuracy of the classification results (Kuhn and Johnson, 2013).
    The formula for the classification accuracy (CA) is given below (Keshavarzi et
    al., 2022): (5) where is the number of rows (or columns) of the matrix, is the
    number in the diagonal cell of the confusion matrix of row and column of each
    category, and is the total number of samples in the matrix. This study calculated
    the resilience indicator to characterise the change in watershed resilience based
    on the runoff data from the upstream Yu River Tong station, the Ka River Wu station,
    and the downstream Hotan River Xiaota station. Indicators affecting resilience
    were then selected for the upper, and middle and lower reaches of the Hotan River
    Basin based on meteorological and hydrological characteristics and water-use features,
    and the drivers of resilience were initially explored using PCA. To better illustrate
    the degree of influence of the drivers on watershed resilience, we classified
    the of each river into two categories based on the multi-annual resilience mean,
    representing low (below the multi-annual mean) and high (above the multi-annual
    mean) levels. Three RF models were calibrated for the sample sets of predictors
    and target variables (resilience levels, low/high) in the upper, and middle and
    lower reaches of the Hotan River Basin based on the classification results of
    . The importance of the characteristic variables of the resilience RF model was
    captured by altering the order of the input variables to obtain OOB classification
    errors. 3. Results 3.1. Watershed resilience characteristics To understand the
    long-term characteristics of watershed resilience, the monthly runoff data from
    the three representative hydrological stations, Tong (upstream), Wu (upstream),
    and Xiaota (downstream) were used to calculate the resilience indicator (Fig.
    3). There is no significant linear trend in the resilience of the three stations
    in the Hotan River Basin (Fig. 3a); however, there are differences in the calculated
    results (Table 3). The overall watershed resilience is low (theoretical values
    are 0–8), with the ranges at the Tong, Wu, and Xiaota stations being 1.33–3.17
    (mean: 2.43), 1.33–3.50 (mean: 2.71), and 0.08–3.17 (mean: 1.98), respectively,
    and the lowest occurring at Xiaota station, implying that resilience downstream
    is lower than that upstream. The Tong and Wu stations are located at the outlets
    of the Yu and Ka Rivers, respectively, and the magnitude of change in resilience
    at the Tong station (1.83) is smaller than that at the Wu station (2.17), because
    the utilisation of water resources in the Ka River is greater than that in the
    Yu River (Yu et al., 2021). The lower Hotan River Xiaota station is located at
    the outlet of the basin, and the runoff is influenced by human activities in the
    oasis area, such as agricultural diversion for irrigation. The variability of
    resilience (3.08) is greater than those at the Tong and Wu stations. Furthermore,
    the coefficient of variation (Cv) reflects the relative interannual resilience
    variability (Table 3). The Cvs of the resilience of the two tributaries, namely
    the Yu and Ka Rivers, are smaller, and the Cv of the resilience at the downstream
    Xiaota station is much higher than those of the Yu and Ka Rivers, which is related
    to the fact that the rivers have mixed glacial melt, snowmelt, and precipitation
    recharge (Wang et al., 2021). The large interannual resilience variation in the
    middle and lower reaches of the Hotan River Basin is attributed to the high frequency
    and water-consuming nature of activities that occur there, such as water diversion
    for irrigation purposes and water extraction for industrial water use (Huang et
    al., 2021a). Download : Download high-res image (547KB) Download : Download full-size

    0.08 1993, 2008 To understand the variability features of the resilience of the
    upper Hotan River Basin, patterns must be identified in extreme cases. The minimum
    resilience of the Yu River and the Ka River occurred in 1973 and 1974, respectively.
    The minimum resilience of the Hotan River occurred in 1993 and 2008. The maximum
    resilience of the Yu and Ka Rivers occurred in 2005 and 2007, respectively. The
    maximum resilience of the Hotan River occurred in 2011 and 2018. This can be explained,
    to some extent, by the annual runoff accumulation distance–level curve (Fig. 4).
    The Yu River (Tong station) experienced decreasing runoff with sharp fluctuations
    from 1963 to 2000 and increasing runoff from 2001 to 2020. The Ka River (Wu station)
    experienced decreasing runoff from 1958 to 2004 and increasing runoff from 2005
    to 2020. The Hotan River (Xiaota station) experienced decreasing runoff from 1965
    to 2009 and increasing runoff from 2010 to 2020. Download : Download high-res

    Basin Previous scientific advances combined with established conceptual frameworks
    have been shown that watershed resilience is influenced by numerous elements (Ho
    et al., 2018; McCluney et al., 2014). Using the IHA7.1 software that was used
    to compute the hydrological variability indicators for the Yu and Ka Rivers in
    the upper reaches of the Hotan River Basin, PCA was chosen to select the important
    indicators due to autocorrelation and redundancy among the indicators. For the
    Yu River (Fig. 5a), the eigenvalue of the first principal component (PC1) is 13.84,
    with a contribution rate of 31.5 %, and that of the second principal component
    (PC2) is 6.05, with a contribution rate of 13.7 % and a cumulative contribution
    rate of 45.2 %. The eigenvalues of the first 11 PCs (PC1–PC11) are all >1, with
    a cumulative contribution rate of 84.0 %. Therefore, PC1–PC11 are selected to
    screen the explanatory variables for the resilience of the Yu River. For PC1,
    the annual extreme minimum flow loading is larger (30-day minimum, 7-day minimum,
    90-day minimum, and 3-day minimum). The annual extreme maximum flows (3-day maximum,
    30-day maximum, 90-day maximum, and 7-day maximum) are loaded at higher values
    for PC2. The highest loadings for PC3 to PC11 correspond to the summer temperature,
    precipitation, fall rate, low pulse count (and high pulse count), median streamflow
    in August, autumn precipitation, rise rate, and Julian date of each annual 1-day
    maximum. For the Ka River (Fig. 5b), the eigenvalue of the first principal component
    (PC1) is 11.8, with a contribution rate of 26.8 %, and the eigenvalues of the
    first 10 PCs (PC1–PC10) are all >1, with a cumulative contribution rate of 82.2
    %. PC1–PC10 are identified as the selected critical factors for principal component
    preference, in the following order: 90-day minimum, 90-day maximum, spring temperature,
    spring precipitation, precipitation, high pulse duration, low pulse duration,
    median streamflow in June, winter precipitation, and high pulse count. Download

    Fig. 6a and b illustrate the relative importance of the feature variables in the
    RF models for the Yu and Ka Rivers. The feature variables fall into two categories,
    namely hydrological variability indicators and meteorological indicators, with
    the hydrological variability indicators being significantly more important than
    the meteorological indicators. The optimal set of factors for the RF classification
    model of the resilience of the Yu River (Fig. 6a) contains the 30-day maximum,
    base flow index, low pulse duration, median streamflow in May, median streamflow
    in August, median streamflow in October, and 7-day maximum, with a classification
    accuracy of 84.2 %. The 30-day maximum is clearly more influential than the other
    indicators, and the 30-day maximum, base flow index (calculated from the 7-day
    minimum and mean flow for the year), and 7-day maximum, which are related to annual
    extreme flows, are of decreasing importance for resilience. This implies that
    the occurrence of extreme hydrological events, particularly those with high flow
    durations, has a significant effect on the resilience of the Yu River. The low
    pulse duration is more influential than the monthly mean runoff indices. In addition,
    there is little difference in the importance of seasonal runoff throughout the
    year. Fig. 7 shows the relationships between the key factors affecting the resilience
    of the Yu River. The 30-day minimum is significantly correlated with the base
    flow index, median streamflow in August, and 7-day maximum, with correlation coefficients
    of −0.348 (p = 0.01), 0.564 (p = 0.001), and 0.914 (p = 0.001), respectively;
    there is no significant correlation with other indicators. There is a significant
    positive correlation between the base flow index and median streamflow in October
    (correlation coefficient: 0.457; p = 0.001), and significant negative correlations
    with the low pulse duration and 7-day maximum. The median streamflow in May has
    a significant positive correlation with the median streamflow in August for the
    low-resilience sample (correlation coefficient: 0.467, p = 0.01) and a positive
    correlation with the median streamflow in October for each sample set at various
    levels of significance. The correlation coefficient between the median streamflow
    in August and the 7-day maximum is 0.285 (p = 0.05). The degree of influence of
    each factor on the resilience of the Yu River varies (Fig. 6a), with the effects
    of the 30-day maximum and median streamflow in August not differing significantly.
    The base flow index and 7-day maximum, contribute to the resilience of the Yu
    River, while the low pulse duration, median streamflow in May, and median streamflow
    in October are significant in reducing resilience, and are thus more important
    influential factors for water resource management. Download : Download high-res

    The optimal set of factors for the RF classification model of the resilience of
    Ka River contains seven indicators with decreasing importance in the following
    order: 7-day maximum >1-day maximum > median streamflow in June >30-day maximum
    >3-day maximum > median streamflow in February > autumn temperature, with a classification
    accuracy of 71.4 %. It is not surprising that the factors representing the categories
    of the total annual runoff maximum and duration have markedly greater overall
    influence on the resilience of the Ka River than those of the other indicators,
    with the average annual summer runoff being slightly more important than those
    in the other seasons, and temperature being more important than precipitation
    (Fig. 6b). The distribution of different samples (low/high resilience levels)
    for each of the key factors for the Ka River varied, as reflected by the differences
    in the mean, peak, and fluctuation levels, as well as the correlational relationships
    between the factors, as shown in Fig. 8. The correlation coefficients between
    the 7-day maximum and the 1-day maximum, median streamflow in June, 30-day maximum,
    and 3-day maximum are 0.966 (p = 0.001), 0.378 (p = 0.01), 0.940 (p = 0.001),
    and 0.985 (p = 0.001), respectively. There is a highly significant positive correlation
    between the 1-day maximum and median streamflow in June, 30-day maximum, and 3-day
    maximum (p = 0.001). The median streamflow in June has a strongly significant
    positive correlation with the 30-day maximum, 3-day maximum, and median streamflow
    in February (p = 0.001). The correlation coefficient between the 30-day maximum
    and 3-day maximum is 0.924 (p = 0.001). No significant correlations exist among
    the other indicators. The importance of each indicator on the resilience of the
    Ka River varies (Fig. 6b), with the 7-day maximum being significantly important
    in reducing resilience. The importance of the 1-day maximum, as wells as those
    of the median streamflow in June, 30-day maximum, 3-day maximum, and autumn temperature
    on the resilience of the Ka River do not differ greatly. Download : Download high-res

    of the Hotan River Basin Outflow from the Hotan River is driven by elements stemming
    from both natural and human activities. PCA and RF were used to identify the primary
    factors influencing the resilience of the Hotan River. The PCA revealed six PCs
    (PC1–PC6) with eigenvalues >1, explaining 44.7 %, 15.5 %, 8.4 %, 7.0 %, 5.3 %,
    and 5.0 % of the total variance, respectively, with a cumulative explanation of
    85.9 % of the total variance (Fig. 9). The large PC1 loadings on the arable land
    area, gross output value of agriculture, and gross output value of agriculture,
    forestry, animal husbandry and fishery represent the substantial impact of factors
    from agricultural development. Agricultural development is the dominant cause
    of the apparent decrease in surface runoff inland river basins (Zhang et al.,
    2012). PC2 has a strong positive loading on the grain crop yield per unit area
    and a strong negative loading on the soil salinisation rate, representing the
    results of the crop cultivation structure and degree of soil salinisation in the
    basin. The behaviour driven by PC3 has a strong positive loading effect on precipitation,
    representing the origin of surface runoff. PC4 has a high loading effect on the
    GDP average growth rate (−) and Hotan Oasis water diversion (+), thereby representing
    the level of development of the oasis economy. PC5 has a strong negative loading
    on the population growth rate, which is the major driver of the development and
    use of water resources, and an increase in population inevitably leads to an increase
    in water demand. The oilseed crop yield per unit area has the highest loadings
    on PC6. The top six PCs with the highest loadings for the explanatory variables
    are the arable land area, grain crop yield per unit area, precipitation, GDP average
    growth rate, population growth rate and oilseed crop yield per unit area. Download

    PCA of each indicator in the middle and lower reaches of the Hotan River Basin.
    An exploratory analysis based on PCA was performed to screen for the optimal factors
    using the importance of the RF algorithm output. The selection of the indicators
    was based on the OOB error of the RF algorithm, and the importance levels are
    shown in Fig. 10. Among these critical predictor variables, there are different
    groupings, including water resource endowment, ecological environment, and socioeconomic,
    with the water resource endowment indicators being significantly more important
    than the ecological environment indicators. The model contains the optimal factors
    of watershed inflow, Xiaota station runoff, annual precipitation, population growth
    rate, effective irrigated area, and oilseed crop yield per unit area, with a classification
    accuracy of 87 %. The importance of these six factors for the resilience of the
    Hotan River decreases in that order. The indicators have various correlations
    (Fig. 11), among which the watershed inflow has a significant positive correlation
    with Xiaota station runoff, and annual precipitation and has a negative correlation
    with the oilseed crop yield per unit area. The correlation coefficient between
    the Xiaota station runoff and annual precipitation is 0.453 (p = 0.01), and the
    effective irrigated area correlation coefficient is 0.403, with a significance
    level of 0.05. In addition, there is a significant negative correlation between
    the effective irrigated area and oilseed crop yield per unit area, with a correlation
    coefficient of −0.429 (p = 0.05). The importance of the indicators for each sample
    is illustrated in Fig. 10. Watershed inflow does not differ significantly in importance
    for different samples; Xiaota station runoff, annual precipitation, and effective
    irrigated area are more important factors in the low-resilience samples, and the
    population growth rate and oilseed crop yield per unit area are of greater importance
    in the high-resilience samples. Download : Download high-res image (232KB) Download

    resilience is generally low, often peaking after the dry-to-wet season transition
    The characterisation of watershed resilience reveals that the overall resilience
    of the Hotan River Basin is low and is decreased in the lower reaches compared
    to the case in the upper reaches. The relative interannual variability of watershed
    resilience is similar to that of runoff, with the degree of stability of resilience
    in the upper reaches being related to the river being recharged by a mixture of
    glacial melt, snowmelt, and precipitation (Wang et al., 2021), and resilience
    in the middle and lower reaches being related to the intensity of human activities
    (Huang et al., 2021a). Starting from the years when the maximum and minimum values
    of resilience in the basin occurred, we find that the moments of maximum resilience
    in the Yu, Ka, and Hotan Rivers all occurred during the period of increased surface
    runoff, the moments of the minimum resilience all occurred during the period of
    decreased surface runoff, suggesting that the resilience is more likely to reach
    extreme values after the rivers experiencing alternating wet and dry conditions;
    however, it takes time for the level of resilience to increase. The lowest levels
    of resilience in the Yu and Ka Rivers were consistent regarding the time scale,
    occurring approximately in 1973. Precipitation in the Hotan Oasis gradually decreased
    from the 1950s to the 1970s and began to increase in the 1980s, whereas the temperature
    varied only slightly from the 1950s to the 1960s and increased significantly from
    the 1970s to the 1980s (Shen et al., 2003). The amount of precipitation in the
    summer months at the Yu River Tong station increased from 1960 to 1968, followed
    by a decrease from 1969 to 1981, whereas summer precipitation at the Ka River
    Wu station gradually increased from 1960 to 1967, and then gradually decreased
    from 1968 to 1978 (Huang et al., 2021a). Marked changes in temperature and precipitation
    resulted in significant differences between runoff from the outlet and that in
    the neighbouring years, with the lowest resilience in the upper basin occurring
    in the early 1970s. The Yu River had a period of decreasing runoff from 1963 to
    2000 and increasing runoff from 2001 to 2020, with maximum resilience in 2005
    (over a period of 5 years). For the Ka River, the alternation of dry and wet was
    achieved in 2004, with maximum resilience three years later (2007). The first
    minimum resilience of the Hotan River in the last 60 years occurred in 1993, and
    the second was in 2008. The contribution of human activities to the reduction
    in the outflow from the Hotan River was 73 % from 1989 to 2002, and 127 % from
    2003 to 2012, making the impact of human activities on the resilience of the Hotan
    River significantly greater than that of climate change. The impact of the increased
    intensity of human activities on the resilience of the Hotan River was negative
    (Fu et al., 2018). The Hotan River alternated between dry and wet appropriately
    in 2009, with the dry period (1965–2009) causing resilience to reach its minimum
    (2008), after which resilience gradually increased after the start of the wet
    period, reaching its maximum two years later (2011). This further confirms the
    idea described above that rivers are more likely to reach maximum resilience after
    alternation between wet and dry seasons, although there is a lag in this process.
    We think that this is determined by the manner in which the resilience indicator
    is calculated. The reflects differences from neighbouring points, and variations
    in resilience can be seen as the cumulative result of earlier disturbances (Qi
    et al., 2016). The in this study was calculated based on the runoff data, and
    a prolonged dry period resulted in a decrease in resilience and ultimately a minimum
    value of resilience, while the river achieved a significant change in runoff in
    the adjacent months after alternating between wet and dry seasons, and the resilience
    gradually rose to a maximum value. 4.2. Noteworthy factors in water resource management
    and their relationships to resilience Important drivers of watershed resilience
    were explored separately based on the PCA and RF models. The PCA and RF methods
    differ in their manner of emphasis, with the PCA selecting indicators from all
    of those used to form uncorrelated PC, while retaining as much of the original
    information as possible and involving fewer integrated variables. Consequently,
    the interpretation of each PC is not as precise as the meaning of the original
    variables. Indicators in the same category are easily grouped together, and the
    explanatory variables for each PC are determined based on the magnitude of the
    loading values (Khatami et al., 2016; Lever et al., 2017; Li et al., 2017). The
    RF classification algorithm employed in this study essentially screens for categorical
    indicators that affect the relatively high and low values of resilience, with
    relatively high values referring to the level of resilience on a time scale. The
    RF algorithm ranks the relative importance of resilience through variable importance
    measures, outputs important indicators, and determines their importance (Giri
    et al., 2023; Rodriguez-Galiano et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2020). There are commonalities
    in the indicators corresponding to each PC of the upper reaches of the Hotan River
    Basin, with the annual extreme minimum flow, annual extreme maximum flow, temperature
    and precipitation being in the high loading element categories for PC1 to PC4.
    The factor outputs from the two tributary RF resilience models mainly belong to
    Groups 2, 1, and 4 (Table 2), with the most important indicators for classifying
    the resilience of the Yu and Ka Rivers being the 30-day maximum and 7-day maximum,
    respectively, followed by the base flow index and 1-day maximum. Due to their
    runoff components, the Yu River and the Ka Rive have different sensitivities to
    climate change, differences, and resilience drivers. The differences in the indicators
    belonging to Group 1 (Yu River, median streamflow in May; Ka River, median streamflow
    in June) may be due to the different intra-annual distributions of the two tributaries
    owing to the regulating effect of the Wuluwati Reservoir (Huang et al., 2021b).
    The Wuluwati Reservoir is located at the upper reaches of the Ka River, and the
    discharge of the reservoir causes an excessive reduction in the peak flows. Between
    2003 and 2012, the commissioning of the Wuluwati Reservoir resulted in a significant
    reduction in the amount of runoff in the Ka River during August, while an increase
    in the flow of the Yu River resulted in a loss of synchronisation of the flow
    processes in the two tributaries (Fu et al., 2018; Huang et al., 2021b; Wang,
    2014). In Section 4.1, we hypothesised that watershed resilience is more likely
    to reach an extreme value after the transition from the dry to the wet season.
    The summer flood season is usually from June to August, with May being the transition
    period. The importance of the May flow to the resilience of the Yu River is greater,
    whereas the Wuluwati Reservoir of the Ka River can play a role in reducing the
    flood peaks, resulting in an even greater importance of the June flow to the Ka
    River resilience. The resilience of the two tributaries is determined primarily
    by temperature rather than precipitation, as confirmed by various studies (Li
    et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2022; Xu et al., 2011) showing that temperature is
    the dominant factor influencing the increase in flow in the upper reaches of the
    Hotan River Basin, whereas precipitation has an insignificant effect on runoff.
    In contrast, Fan et al. (2011) and Fan et al. (2013) studied the runoff variations
    in the Hotan River Basin and showed that precipitation had a negative effect on
    runoff in the Hotan River, whereas the effect of temperature was not significant.
    This differs from the findings above because of a decreasing trend in runoff in
    the Hotan River Basin earlier that 2006 (Fan et al., 2011). Nevertheless, a non-significant
    increasing trend over long runoff series, especially since the beginning of the
    21st century, is evident, with warmer temperatures having led to an accelerated
    rate of glacial melt and increased precipitation (Wang et al., 2021; You et al.,
    2022). From 1990 to 2010, the mean annual temperature and annual precipitation
    in the Hotan Oasis exhibited increasingly more pronounced fluctuations, with the
    warming in autumn being the most pronounced (Aynur and Qiu, 2013), which may have
    contributed to the autumn temperature being an important indicator affecting the
    resilience of the Ka River. However, the reason why the same result does not exist
    for the Yu River is unclear and requires further investigations. The PCA results
    showed that the resilience of the two tributaries was jointly influenced by both
    the total and duration of annual runoff maximum/minimum, temperature, and precipitation;
    however, it was not possible to distinguish the relative importance of all indicators.
    In contrast, the RF model captured the importance of each indicator on resilience
    in a novel way, demonstrating a better capacity to classify the resilience of
    the Yu and Ka Rivers with accuracies of 84.2 % and 71.4 %, respectively. The input
    variables in the optimal indicator set were considered as the most effective variables
    influencing the relative levels of resilience. The explanatory variables chosen
    based on the PCA for the middle and lower reaches of the Hotan River Basin are,
    in order of importance, arable land area, grain crop yield per unit area, precipitation,
    GDP average growth rate, population growth rate, and oilseed crop yield per unit
    area. The RF model outputs the six best indicators with 87 % classification accuracy
    listed in order of importance as follows: watershed inflow, Xiaota station runoff,
    annual precipitation, population growth rate, effective irrigated area, and oilseed
    crop yield per unit area. This implies that the main and direct factors affecting
    the resilience of the middle and lower reaches of the Hotan River Basin from 1988
    to 2020 were inflow, outflow, and precipitation. Watershed inflow directly affects
    runoff at Xiaota station, whereas precipitation is more important to the resilience
    of the middle and lower reaches of the basin. This anomaly is caused by the data
    obtained from surface weather stations located in the Hotan region, where the
    Hotan River runoff is concentrated in summer, stemming primarily from glacial
    melt and snowmelt in the Kunlun Mountains, and data measured from the surface
    meteorological stations do not reflect the climate change in the mountains (Xu
    et al., 2011). Blind production activities and unplanned use of water resources
    in arid regions have negative effects on regional water resources, leading to
    a decrease in river runoff. Population growth inevitably leads to an increase
    in water demand within the basin, which promotes economic growth, and human activities
    directly affect the land use types in the Hotan Oasis. The arable land area increased
    by 550 km2 from 1990 to 2010, and arable land, as the natural individual that
    consumes the most water resources, has directly led to a decrease in the flow
    of the main stream of the Hotan River (Fu et al., 2018). With the increasing population,
    the area of irrigated agriculture, production and living activities of the people
    have significantly increased, the river system injected into the main stream of
    the Hotan River has decreased, and artificial ditches and reservoirs have expanded
    from the original ones, and began to damage the storage capacity of the natural
    lakes, thereby triggering drought (Aynur and Qiu, 2013). Effective irrigated area
    and oilseed crop yield per unit area are two factors that indicate agricultural
    water use efficiency and crop cultivation structure in the Hotan Oasis. Over-exploitation
    and inefficient use of surface water in oasis agricultural development lead to
    wastage of water resources and reduction of surface runoff, and changes in cropping
    structure affect surface runoff in arid regions (Zhang et al., 2012). The RF model
    screens out the oil crop yield to predict the resilience levels; however, the
    area under oil crop cultivation accounts for only 1.1 % of the cultivated area
    (Xinjiang Statistical Yearbook of 2019). This leads us to believe that this behaviour
    is caused by the model relying too heavily on the relationship between resilience
    and oilseed crop yield. Combining the two methods, we can observe that the population
    growth rate in the optimal indicator set of the RF output is also part of the
    explanatory variables of the PC, which, to some extent, affirms the rationality
    of the selection of resilience indicators in the middle and lower reaches of the
    Hotan River Basin. It further illustrates that resilience in the middle and lower
    reaches of the basin is mainly influenced by the water resource status of the
    basin, population growth, and level of development of oasis agriculture. The RF
    model has advantages in classifying the resilience of the Hotan River Basin and
    can output important drivers and magnitudes of importance compared to the PCA
    approach. The PCA affirms the rationality of the selected indicators to a certain
    extent and complements the relationship between resilience and each indicator.
    The important indicators screened based on the above methods are effective and
    noteworthy factors in water resource management, which can reflect the relationships
    among climate change, human activities, and water resources in the arid region
    basin and provide a conceptual basis for the unified regulation of the basin water
    resources. 4.3. Water resource management strategies for the Hotan River Basin
    based on resilience constraints The upper reaches of the Hotan River Basin are
    in the high mountainous areas where runoff is formed based on more water resources,
    whereas the runoff consumption areas (middle and lower reaches) have fewer water
    resources. The seasonal inflow of water varies between the upstream Yu and Ka
    Rivers, making the local industrial, agricultural, and pastoral productions subject
    to fluctuations. Human activities are more prominent in the oasis, and water consumption
    mainly relies on glacial melt and snowmelt from the mountainous areas, which are
    affected significantly by climate change and seasonal turnover (Sun and Baidourel,
    2018). Therefore, there are differences in the drivers of resilience between the
    upper and middle and lower reaches of the Hotan River Basin, and there is a lag
    in resilience in the middle and lower reaches compared to that in the upper reaches
    of the basin. In this study, appropriate water management measures for the basin
    are proposed based on the research results from different river sections. The
    upper reaches of the watershed resilience are mainly affected by climate change,
    which affects the runoff process, and the upstream hydrological variability indicators
    can indicate changes in resilience. For example, the factors that significantly
    increase the resilience of the Yu River are the 30-day maximum, base flow index,
    and 7-day maximum, which require special attention in water resources management
    (Fig. 6). We can strengthen the monitoring of water resource resilience in the
    basin and focus on the influence of surface water hydrological extremes on watershed
    resilience. A basin-wide hydrological monitoring system should be established
    to collect real-time information on water quantity at important hydrological cross
    sections and hydraulic hubs to improve the predictability of watershed resilience.
    There is a lag in watershed resilience in the middle and lower reaches compared
    with that in the upper reaches of the basin. Based on changes in the resilience
    of the upper reaches, it is possible to improve/stabilise the resilience of the
    middle and lower reaches through increased water conservation efforts and improved
    water use efficiency in the oasis. The Hotan River Basin is a region where agriculture
    is the mainstay of the economy; therefore, it is essential to increase investments
    in agricultural water conservation, upgrade agricultural irrigation technology,
    reduce water losses in all water-use segments, and improve the efficiency of the
    agricultural irrigation water use. Also, it is necessary to coordinate the upstream
    and downstream water use in the Hotan River Basin, allocate agricultural and ecological
    water, and rationally allocate surface water and groundwater. Ultimately, watershed
    resilience will be enhanced, and the efficient use and scientific management of
    water resources in the basin will be realised. 5. Conclusions This study discusses
    the variation patterns and attempts to identify the drivers of resilience in the
    Hotan River Basin. The factors affecting resilience are chosen for the upper runoff
    formation area of the Hotan River Basin and the middle and lower oasis consumption
    areas of the Hotan River Basin. Through a combination of principal component analysis
    (PCA) and random forest (RF) methodologies, the resilience level of the basin
    was divided into high and low categories based on the resilience indicator , the
    optimal indicator set was output, and the influence of important indicators on
    the accuracy of the resilience classification was examined. The following conclusions
    were drawn: (1) The overall watershed resilience of the Hotan River Basin is low,
    and the resilience of the downstream Hotan River Xiaota station is lower than
    those of the upstream Yu River Tong station and Ka River Wu station. The coefficient
    of variation (Cv) of the resilience of the Xiaota station is much higher than
    those of the Tong and Wu stations because activities with high frequency and high
    rate of water consumption, such as water diversion and irrigation, occur in the
    middle and lower reaches of the Hotan River. The impact of human activities on
    the resilience of the Hotan River is significantly greater than that of climate
    change, and the impact of the increased intensity of human activities on resilience
    is negative. Rivers are more likely to reach maximum resilience after experiencing
    alternating wet and dry seasons; however, although there is a time lag in this
    process. (2) Using an RF classification machine learning algorithm, we were able
    to predict high/low levels of resilience for the Yu, Ka, and Hotan Rivers with
    accuracy levels of 84.2 %, 71.4 %, and 87 %, respectively. The key factors affecting
    the resilience of the Yu River are the 30-day maximum, base flow index, low pulse
    duration, median streamflow in May, median streamflow in August, median streamflow
    in October, and 7-day maximum. The optimal factors for the classification of the
    resilience of the Ka River, ranked in order of importance, are the 7-day maximum,
    1-day maximum, median streamflow in June, 30-day maximum, 3-day maximum, median
    streamflow in February, and autumn temperature. The resilience factors of the
    Hotan River are, in descending order of importance, watershed inflow, Xiaota station
    runoff, population growth rate, and effective irrigated area. This study provides
    new ideas for identifying the important factors driving watershed resilience in
    arid regions, and the results are highly relevant regarding the establishment
    of effective water resource management tools and control mechanisms throughout
    the entire basin. CRediT authorship contribution statement Yuehui Wang: Data curation,

  limitations: The study relied on data from a single river basin in China, so it
    is not clear whether the findings can be generalized to other river basins in
    different regions of the world. Additionally, the study did not consider the potential
    impacts of climate change on the resilience of the basin in the future.
  relevance_evaluation: The study is highly relevant to the specific point I am making
    in my literature review. It provides empirical evidence to support the claim that
    the resilience of river basins can vary greatly depending on factors such as climate,
    topography, and human activities. The study also highlights the importance of
    considering the resilience of both the upper and lower reaches of a river basin
    when developing water management strategies.

  explanation: The provided research aims to analyze the potential of remote sensing
    (RS) data and machine learning (ML) models to more accurately predict almond yields.
    The key independent variable is the RS data, while the dependent variable is the
    almond yield. A wide range of RS data from various platforms with different spatial
    resolutions were considered, both from open and proprietary sources. The study
    also evaluated several ML regression models (random forest, XGBoost, gradient
    boosting, bagging, and AdaBoost) to predict almond yields, identifying key factors
    that significantly influence prediction accuracy.

    Keywords: Prunus dulcis; machine learning; regression models; multispectral data;
    vegetation indices; remote sensing 1. Introduction The almond tree, Prunus dulcis
    (var. dulcis (Rosaceae)), is a globally important nut tree [1]. Originating from
    the Middle East and South Asia, almonds are extremely important for the human
    diet due to their high protein content, good fats, and essential micronutrients,
    including vitamin E and magnesium. Moreover, almond consumption provides diverse
    health benefits, from improving cholesterol levels and cardiovascular health,
    to potentially reducing cancer risks [2]. Almond production is very important
    for the economy in many regions of the world [3]. Almonds are mainly produced
    in the United States of America (1,858,010 tons), Australia (360,328 tons), and
    Spain (245,990 tons) [4]. Climate change poses significant risks to crop yields,
    due to changing weather patterns and more regular risky weather events, such as
    floods, droughts, and heat waves [5]. These events can have a negative impact
    on almond productivity and quality [6], compromising stock supplies and promoting
    price fluctuations. Given these circumstances, precise crop yield prediction has
    become indispensable, as it equips policymakers and market participants with essential
    tools to effectively mitigate these risks. Through the analysis of historical
    data and current agricultural conditions, it becomes possible to develop models
    for estimating seasonal yield forecasts and evaluating potential supply shortages
    or surpluses [7]. Furthermore, this information may assist governmental agencies
    in making informed decisions regarding trade policies, food aid, and agricultural
    investments [8]. Crop yield prediction is a difficult undertaking that requires
    integrating several factors, including weather, soil properties, pest and disease
    incidence, and management practices [9]. More precise modelling techniques for
    forecasting agricultural yield have recently been developed, due to developments
    in technology and data analysis. Simple statistical models (i.e., linear regressions)
    remain the most popular approach for predicting agricultural yield, providing
    helpful information for decisionmakers [10]. However, machine learning (ML) algorithms
    have become a promising approach, as they can increase prediction accuracy by
    finding patterns and relationships in the data [11]. Due to these facts, machine
    learning (ML) is currently one of the most important subfields of artificial intelligence
    (AI) [12]. Remote sensing (RS) is another promising field of research that may
    potentially benefit crop yield prediction. Advances in RS technologies have made
    it possible to monitor crop development and health in real time from aerial viewpoints,
    which has enhanced crop production forecasting. RS technologies provide detailed
    information on the crop conditions, including plant biomass, water content, and
    nutrient status, which can be utilized to make more precise predictions about
    future yields [13]. Numerous studies emphasize the significance of ML and RS in
    predicting crop yield. Klompenburg et al. [14] developed a systematic literature
    review to detect prevalent models, features, and evaluation parameters in crop
    yield prediction. The authors observed that linear regression (LR) and neural
    networks (NN) are frequently applied models, along with random forest (RF) and
    support vector machines (SVM). Moreover, rainfall, temperature, and soil type
    are the main features implemented, along with vegetation indices (VIs), such as
    the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) [15] and the enhanced vegetation
    index (EVI) [16]. Ali et al. [17] highlighted the application of various RS technologies
    alongside multi- and hyperspectral data, radar, and LiDAR data in crop monitoring
    and yield prediction. They identified the NDVI, the EVI, and the soil-adjusted
    vegetation index (SAVI) [18] as commonly used VIs. Similarly, Escolà et al. [19]
    evaluated the application of Sentinel-2 derived VIs, such as the NDVI, the wide
    dynamic range vegetation index (WDRVI), the green–red vegetation index (GRVI),
    and the green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI), for estimating barley
    production. Regarding almond yield prediction using RS data, two studies have
    emerged. Zhang et al. [20] applied ML models to satellite (Landsat 8) and aerial
    imagery to forecast almond yield from orchards in California. They achieved a
    coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.71 for early and mid-season predictions
    using stochastic gradient boosting (SGB). Tang et al. [21], also in the context
    of California, explored the use of deep learning (DL) methods, using unmanned
    aerial vehicle (UAV) data, and developed a convolutional neural network (CNN).
    Their model obtained an R2 of 0.96 and a low error of 6.6% for tree-level almond
    yield estimation, emphasizing the significant potential of DL for precise tree-level
    yield prediction. Although the abovementioned studies exhibit strong results in
    forecasting almond yield, they are tailored to California [20,21] and, as far
    as we know, there is a notable absence of research specifically dedicated to Portuguese
    almond yield forecasting. Despite the growing importance of almond cultivation
    in this country, this absence represents a critical gap in our understanding of
    the factors that influence almond yields in this region. The current research
    seeks to fill this research gap by developing a method for predicting almond yields
    in the TM region of Portugal, using ML regression models, and identifying the
    key factors that significantly influence almond yields. Furthermore, an improvement
    on previous studies may be the analysis of RS data from a diverse range of platforms,
    including freely available medium-resolution data and proprietary higher resolution
    data. This strategic combination may be used to investigate the effectiveness
    of medium-resolution RS platforms, compared to their higher resolution counterparts,
    for predicting almond yields. This information could potentially be used by sector
    stakeholders to enhance the decision-making process, enabling more informed and
    strategic choices for optimizing cultivation practices, resource allocation, and
    overall productivity. Considering the research gaps identified, the purpose of
    this study is 4-fold: (1) to use state-of-the-art ML regression models to accurately
    simulate the yield from several orchards in the TM region; (2) to integrate RS
    data from different platforms at different spatial resolutions, including from
    both open and proprietary platforms; (3) to identify the key features that significantly
    influence these predictions; and (4) to discuss potential applications of these
    findings in the sector. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Area In this study
    multiple almond orchards (AO) are included, from four distinct almond growers
    (AGs) within the TM region of northern Portugal. Regarding AO1, AO2, and AO3,
    these are located in the Torre de Moncorvo municipality. Regarding AO4, this is
    located between the Vila Flor and Alfândega da Fé municipalities (Figure 1a).
    These orchards present different characteristics, namely AO1 has 5.7 hectares
    with 1387 almond trees; AO2 has 2.9 hectares with 765 almond trees; AO3 has 3.0
    hectares with 756 almond trees; and AO4, the largest area, has 12.3 hectares with
    3198 almond trees. Figure 1. Overview of the location of the almond orchards,
    for each almond grower (AG) (a), and (b) the yield values, from 2017 to 2021,
    presented in kg/ha, for each AG. This region of TM is mountainous and presents
    warm and dry summers and moderately cold and wet winters [22]. These characteristics
    are typical of the Mediterranean climate, which makes the region suitable for
    almond cultivation. Considering the yield levels recorded from 2017 to 2021, AO4
    and AO3 had the highest productivity, averaging 1041 kg/ha and 785 kg/ha, respectively,
    while AO1 and AO2 had lower productivity with an average of 462 kg/ha and 372
    kg/ha, respectively, in the same period (Figure 1b). 2.2. Data Collection and
    Processing The data processing workflow consists of four sequential steps (Figure
    2). In the first step, the data acquired from various sources is collected, including
    the agronomic parameters, vegetation indices, and climate data (identified in
    the following subsections). The second step involves the integration of various
    features into a dataset comprising 171 features. The third step includes the application
    of ML regression models, which includes the feature selection process, the selection
    of ML regression models, and hyperparameter optimization. In the fourth step,
    the model evaluation is conducted. The details of the four-step approach are provided
    in the subsequent subsections. Figure 2. Data processing workflow stages: (1)
    data collection; (2) dataset creation; (3) application of machine learning (ML)
    models; and (4) model evaluation. 2.2.1. Agronomic Data The agronomic data contains
    several parameters collected from each site. In addition to yield data (the target
    feature), yearly irrigation information was also acquired from each grower, recorded
    as binary values (0 for no irrigation and 1 for irrigation). Irrigation is recognized
    as a vital factor that significantly influences the optimal growth and development
    of trees, consequently affecting crop productivity [23]. The availability and
    efficient distribution of water directly affects physiological processes, such
    as transpiration and nutrient uptake, which are critical for trees to reach their
    full yield potential. Moreover, appropriate irrigation practices can help alleviate
    the adverse effects of environmental stressors, such as droughts or heat waves,
    which are becoming increasingly prevalent due to climate change [24]. Furthermore,
    data regarding the average tree age (plantation date) were incorporated as a feature
    of the dataset. The age of almond trees is of paramount importance for productivity,
    as older trees tend to have more extensive root systems, established canopies,
    and enhanced nutrient storage, leading to increased almond production and increased
    overall orchard yield [20]. The data were pre-processed for each orchard separately
    to filter the outliers, based on distribution analysis. 2.2.2. Remote Sensing
    Data Several RS data from various platforms with different spatial resolutions
    were considered (Table 1). The Global Satellite Mapping of Precipitation (GSMaP)
    by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) was used, which provides global
    precipitation data using a combination of sensors at ~11 km [25]. It was developed
    in Japan specifically for the GPM mission [26]. The Land Surface Temperature (LST)
    from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), operated by the
    National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), was obtained at a resolution
    of 1 km [27]. It should be noted that the thermal sensor in the MODIS only offers
    1 km resolution. Landsat 8, operated by NASA and the United States Geological
    Survey (USGS), offers multispectral data at a resolution of 30 m [28]. Land cover
    classification and analysis of vegetation are potential applications of these
    data. Sentinel-2 was developed by the European Space Agency (ESA) and provides
    multispectral imagery at a resolution of 10 m. This is the best resolution imagery
    available for free today [29]. PlanetScope, which is a proprietary data source,
    is formed of several small satellites (constellation), operated by Planet Labs
    Inc., designed for high-frequency global imaging of Earth. The satellites acquire
    imagery in the visible and near-infrared spectra and provide a spatial resolution
    of 3 m. The proprietary high-resolution data provided by PlanetScope enables detailed
    mapping and monitoring of various features, including urban areas, vegetation
    dynamics, and environmental changes [30]. Table 1. Remote sensing platform overview:
    sensors, bands, spatial resolutions, and revisiting time. Monthly composites from
    GSMaP, MODIS Terra LST, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2 (from 2017 to 2021) were computed
    using the Google Earth Engine (GEE). The GEE is an online infrastructure that
    archives satellite imagery and geospatial data, offering powerful analytics tools,
    leveraging cloud-based infrastructure. These benefits make it an invaluable tool
    for exploring Earth’s dynamics and supporting fact-based decision making [31].
    On the other hand, PlanetScope’s monthly composites were acquired using the Planet
    Explorer platform, which is a fully automated, cloud-based imaging and analysis
    platform that grants users access to comprehensive, daily data from the PlanetScope
    and SkySat constellations. 2.2.3. Vegetation Indices Computation VIs were also
    included in the feature dataset, namely the enhanced vegetation index 2 (EVI2),
    the GRVI, the NDVI, and the SAVI (Table 2). The use of the EVI2 in crop yield
    prediction models is justified by its many advantages, and has been shown to achieve
    higher prediction accuracy compared to other VIs, such as the NDVI [32]. It also
    offers higher sensitivity, especially in areas with high biomass, and provides
    valuable information on crop conditions and yields [33,34]. Regarding the GRVI,
    it is often used as a phenological indicator, detecting changes in canopy vegetation
    [35]. Moreover, in a study by Sanches et al. [36], the GRVI showed a high correlation
    with sugarcane yields. Concerning the NDVI, it can be implemented to monitor crop
    growth, detect plant stress, and make decisions regarding irrigation, fertilization,
    pesticide application, and has also been employed in numerous studies to accurately
    predict crop yields [37,38]. The SAVI, in turn, is also a suitable VI for use
    in yield prediction models, since it attempts to minimize the effects of soil
    brightness using a correction factor [39]. It is similar to the NDVI, but accounts
    for variations in soils, making it useful in arid and semi-arid regions, where
    vegetation cover is low and soil brightness can significantly affect vegetation
    detection [40]. Furthermore, in a study by da Silva et al. [41], the SAVI had
    the highest correlation with soybean grain yield, possibly due to the use of the
    soil effect correction, demonstrating its ability to predict crop yields. Table

    G: green; L = 0.5; N: near infrared; R: red. As previously mentioned, three different
    platforms, each with varying spatial resolutions, were used to obtain the VIs
    (Section 2.2.2). The data from each platform were processed, and atmospheric corrections
    were implemented before it became available. The data for each orchard were obtained
    using the geospatial data abstraction library (GDAL) in Python to calculate the
    mean value for each grower. Figure 3 illustrates the above-described procedure,
    by displaying an example of the NDVI computed for the three VI platforms, in March
    2019. Figure 3a–c depicts the NDVI images, with the spatial resolution associated
    with each platform. They were then subjected to a mean calculation, yielding a
    singular value that was then used in the creation of the final dataset. These
    three VI datasets were produced to compare the performance of the Landsat 8, Sentinel-2,
    and PlanetScope data. Figure 3. Example of the procedure for creating the dataset.
    The values correspond to the mean NDVI calculated for (a) Landsat 8, (b) Sentinel-2,
    and (c) PlanetScope (e.g., March 2019), corresponding to almond grower 3. 2.3.
    Dataset Creation The final dataset is created using three different groups: climate
    data, VIs, and agronomic data. As mentioned in Section 2.2.3, the three datasets
    were used in parallel with the VIs customized according to the RS platform (Landsat
    8, Sentinel-2, and PlanetScope) to compare the performance of each. This information,
    extracted for each orchard, was then used as potential inputs into the ML regression
    models. Each of the datasets contained 171 features, corresponding to the average
    tree age, irrigation, monthly mean daytime temperature (2017–2021), monthly mean
    nighttime temperature (2017–2021), monthly accumulated precipitation (2017–2021),
    monthly EVI2 (2017–2021), monthly GRVI (2017–2021), monthly NDVI (2017–2021),
    and monthly SAVI (2017–2021). To consider the potential effect of alternate bearing
    (biannual cyclic production patterns), features from the previous year were also
    included to assess their potential impact on the following year’s production.
    In addition to features, the datasets also included the yield (mean kg per ha)
    as a target. 2.4. Application of Machine Learning Regression Models The application
    of ML regression models followed a three-step process: feature selection, model
    implementation, and hyperparameter tuning (detailed in the following subsections).
    In the feature selection phase, relevant features were carefully chosen to enhance
    the model’s accuracy and performance. Subsequently, the regression models were
    implemented using a cross-validation methodology, establishing a connection between
    the input features and the target feature. The final step involved optimizing
    the hyperparameters to fine tune the models to improve the predictive accuracy
    and generalization capability. 2.4.1. Feature Selection Process Feature selection
    plays a key role in the ML pipeline. Selecting the most suitable features improves
    the model’s performance, reduces computational efforts, and assists in the interpretation
    of the results. By selecting the most relevant features, more accurate, efficient,
    and interpretable models can be achieved, facilitating better decision making
    and a better understanding of the underlying data patterns. Herein, for the selection
    of the best possible features, the bestFeatures script [43] was used. This is
    a tool for identifying the best possible combination of features for fitting a
    ML model. This method uses cross-validation (CV) to evaluate different feature
    subsets and their corresponding performance scores (R2). The CV method partitions
    the dataset into training and testing subsets, multiple times (folds). For each
    fold, part of the dataset (testing) is always unseen by the algorithm. It then
    computes the cross-validated score for each combination of features and tracks
    the maximum score achieved, effectively controlling the problem of overfitting.
    The method also ensures a low level of correlation related to the features. The
    output of the method includes the R2 score and error metrics, corresponding to
    the best feature combination. For the current analysis, this method was used considering
    a 5-fold CV, and a combination of 1 to 8 features, determined by the script’s
    best performing approach. The analysis was performed separately for each dataset
    (agronomic features, climate features, and VIs, from the three different platforms),
    as well as for mixed datasets (e.g., climate features + VIs), depending on the
    vegetation data acquisition platform. Table 3 lists the selected features, according
    to the type of features considered. Table 3. Selected features using bestFeatures
    script, categorized by feature type. CD: climate data; DT: daytime temperature;

    PlanetScope; S2: Sentinel-2; VI: vegetation indice. 2.4.2. Machine Learning Regression
    Model Selection Several ML regression models were applied to predict almond yield.
    Among these models, the random forest regressor (RFR) stands out as a prominent
    option due to its effectiveness in supervised learning [44], and it is used in
    many fields of study. The RFR algorithm generates an ensemble of decision trees,
    collectively called an RF. Each decision tree independently learns patterns and
    relationships within the data, contributing equally to the final prediction, improving
    the performance and efficacy of the model and dealing with potential overfitting
    problems [44]. The XGBRegressor (XGBR) was also implemented in this study and
    is a supervised learning algorithm that belongs to the gradient boosting family.
    It employs a boosting technique that sequentially improves decision trees, to
    create a powerful ensemble model [45]. XGBR optimizes the training objective through
    gradient descent, allowing it to effectively identify complex patterns and dependencies
    in the data. The model has shown remarkable performance in several areas, making
    it a valuable tool for almond yield prediction [45]. Regarding the gradient boosting
    regressor (GBR) algorithm, it is also a gradient boosting-based regression model.
    It iteratively builds an ensemble of decision trees, with each successive tree
    better than the previous ones, creating a strong predictive model. The GBR model
    is widely used in predictive analytics and has demonstrated its efficiency and
    potential for predicting almond yield [46]. The bagging regressor (BR) algorithm,
    on the other hand, uses a bagging technique similar to the RFR model. It generates
    an ensemble of decision trees by resampling the training data and fitting each
    sample to a separate tree, which are combined to form the final output. Its ability
    to handle high-dimensional data and complex relationships makes it a suitable
    candidate for almond yield prediction [47]. Lastly, the AdaBoost regressor (ABR)
    algorithm is a boosting-based regression model that iteratively adjusts the weights
    assigned to the training instances, placing more emphasis on the samples that
    are difficult to predict accurately. ABR is known for its adaptability to different
    data types and its ability to handle noisy or incomplete datasets [48]. The ML
    regression models were implemented using the Python library Scikit-learn [49].
    2.4.3. Hyperparameter Tuning Following the selection of the best feature combination,
    the ML models were applied using hyperparameter tuning. This method may significantly
    improve the performance of ML regression models [50] by adjusting each model’s
    internal parameters, such as the learning rate and tree depth. In this study,
    a systematic approach for hyperparameter tuning was employed, utilizing the GridSearchCV
    method with a 5-fold CV. Again, 5-fold cross-validation further ensures robustness
    by splitting the dataset into five subdivisions, using four for training and one
    for validation in a rotating fashion. This iterative process allows the model
    to be trained and validated multiple times, always withholding the testing data
    from the algorithm, providing a robust assessment of its performance across various
    hyperparameter settings. The method examines several hypotheses and identifies
    the optimal hyperparameters, based on the performance of the models, considering
    the R2 results. This approach aims to maximize the predictive accuracy of the
    ML regression models. The specific hyperparameters applied in the implementation
    of the regression models are identified in Table 4. Table 4. Main hyperparameters
    considered during regression models implementation. Tested hyperparameter values:
    n_estimators (NE): 100, 200, 300; max_depth (MD): 3, 5, 7, 9, 1; max_samples (MS):

    L8: Landsat 8; PS: PlanetScope; S2: Sentinel-2; VI: vegetation indice. 2.5. Model
    Evaluation Several well-known metrics to evaluate regression model performance
    were used, including the coefficient of determination (R2), the root mean square
    error (RMSE), and the mean absolute error (MAE). R2 measures the percentage of
    variance in the dependent variable that can be described by the independent variables
    in a regression model [51]. The RMSE accounts for positive and negative deviations
    between predicted and observed values. Regarding the MAE, it is calculated as
    the average of the absolute differences between the predicted and observed values
    of the dependent variable. The average magnitude of errors performed by the model
    is measured in the units of the same order as that of the dependent variable and
    denoted as the MAE. While the RMSE takes the squared differences into account,
    the MAE does not which makes it robust in regard to outliers and insensitive to
    extreme errors. By considering the mean absolute difference between the observed
    and simulated values, the MAE provides the overall accuracy of the model, regardless
    of the direction of the errors [52]. 3. Results 3.1. Comparative Analysis of Regression
    Models for Almond Yield Prediction This study intends to investigate and compare
    the performance of several ML regression models in predicting almond tree yield,
    based on different features extracted from RS platforms and different agronomic
    parameters. The features considered were irrigation, temperature, precipitation,
    and VIs. The regression models evaluated included the RFR, XGBR, GBR, BR, and
    ABR models. Figure 4 shows the performance of the regression models, using different
    types of features, considering the VIs computed by PlanetScope (Figure 4a), Sentinel-2
    (Figure 4b), and Landsat 8 (Figure 4c). When focusing on the irrigation feature
    alone, none of the models demonstrated exceptional performance as a standalone
    feature across all three platforms. The R2 scores for all the models ranged from
    0.32 to 0.38, suggesting limited predictive capabilities. When considering only
    the climatic features, the GBR model and BR model consistently exhibited higher
    performance, with R2 scores of around 0.40. For the VIs only, the ABR model outperformed
    the others, using PlanetScope data (R2 = 0.59). On the other hand, considering
    the VIs calculated using Sentinel-2 data, the BR model performed better (R2 =
    0.49). For the VIs from Landsat 8, the best performance was achieved by the RFR
    model (R2 = 0.61). When combining features, particularly irrigation and climate
    data, the RFR model consistently demonstrated strong performance across all three
    platforms (R2 = 0.68), indicating its superior predictive capabilities for this
    feature combination. Considering the combination of irrigation and VIs, the XGBR
    model obtained the best performance using PlanetScope (R2 = 0.76) and Sentinel-2
    (R2 = 0.66) data. In contrast, the GBR model produced the best result (R2 = 0.73)
    when the Landsat 8 data were used. Combining the climate data and VIs, the ABR
    model performed well using PlanetScope data (R2 = 0.61). On the other hand, the
    XGBR model performed better using the Sentinel-2 (R2 = 0.62) and Landsat 8 data
    (R2 = 0.69). Finally, considering all three groups of features combined (irrigation,
    climate data, and VIs), the XGBR model showed the best performance using PlanetScope
    data (R2 = 0.80), while the RFR model showed the best performance using Sentinel-2
    data (R2 = 0.67) and the ABR model using Landsat 8 data (R2 = 0.72). The results
    presented showed that the XGBR and RFR models proved to be the most appropriate
    models for predicting the target feature using the PlanetScope data across different
    feature combinations. However, when using Landsat 8 data, the ABR model also provided
    remarkable results. Figure 4. Regression model performance based on feature type
    and remote sensing platform, using the coefficient of determination (R2). In (a)
    vegetation indices were computed using PlanetScope data; in (b) vegetation indices
    were computed using Sentinel-2 data; and in (c) vegetation indices were computed
    using Landsat 8 data. The performance of several regression models was also evaluated
    based on MAE and RMSE metrics, considering the different combinations of feature
    types (Table 5). Notably, the best combination of features that yielded optimal
    results varied across the models. When focusing on the irrigation feature, all
    the models (RFR, XGBR, GBR, BR, and ABR) achieved similar performance, with MAE
    values ranging from 158 to 161 kg/ha and RMSE values ranging from 206 to 212 kg/ha.
    For the climate data features, the XGBR (MAE = 210 kg/ha; RMSE = 255 kg/ha) and
    BR (MAE = 184 kg/ha; RMSE = 238 kg/ha) models exhibited slightly higher values
    compared to the other models. Among the VIs, when the PlanetScope data were used,
    the best performance was achieved with the ABR model (MAE = 143 kg/ha; RMSE =
    186 kg/ha). For the Sentinel-2 data, the lowest MAE (165 kg/ha) was obtained with
    the BR model and the lowest RMSE (214 kg/ha) was obtained with the RFR model.
    Considering the VIs from Landsat 8, the lowest MAE (133 kg/ha) was obtained with
    the GBR model and the lowest RMSE (189 kg/ha) with the RFR model. Combining irrigation
    with climate data generally improved the model’s performance, compared to using
    either feature individually, resulting in lower MAE and RMSE values, ranging from
    116 to 137 kg/ha and 158 to 177 kg/ha, respectively. Similarly, incorporating
    all feature types tended to improve the model’s predictive performance, especially
    when using irrigation, climate data, and VIs from PlanetScope, which achieved
    the best performance with the XGBR model (MAE: 95 kg/ha; RMSE: 119 kg/ha). Table

    to Almond Yield Prediction Considering the information from the previous subsection,
    optimal performance was achieved with the XGBR model using the irrigation feature,
    climate data (specifically, the daytime temperature in March), and VIs (the NDVI
    in January and the SAVI in May) calculated using PlanetScope data. This subsection
    is intended to present the features that were important to almond yield prediction.
    Figure 5a shows that in the almond orchards where irrigation was applied (AG3
    and AG4), higher yield values were recorded, about 913 kg/ha, while in the almond
    orchards where irrigation was not applied (AG1 and AG2), lower yield values were
    recorded, about 417 kg/ha. Comparing the NDVI in January and the yield (Figure
    5b), it is possible to observe higher NDVI values related to a higher yield, although
    it is not a clear linear relationship. In the almond orchards of AG4 (Figure 1b),
    higher NDVI values were recorded in January from 2019 to 2021, which may have
    made a positive contribution to achieving higher production values compared to
    other growers. Similarly, regarding the SAVI in May (Figure 5c), it does not seem
    to be linearly associated with the yield, highlighting the importance of ML models,
    as non-linear patterns can be identified by these models. On the other hand, regarding
    the daytime temperature in March (Figure 5d), it is evident that lower values
    were associated with lower yield values. The lowest daytime temperature value
    in March (12.2 °C) was recorded in 2018 in the almond orchards of AG2, which coincided
    with the lowest yield value (82 kg/ha) compared to the other growers (Figure 1b).
    As for the highest values recorded for the daytime temperature in March, the maximum
    value reached was 22.5 °C in 2019 by AG4, who obtained higher yield values (1203
    kg/ha). Figure 5. Correlation charts on the yield with: (a) irrigation; (b) NDVI
    in January; (c) SAVI in May; and (d) daytime temperature in March, Celsius degrees
    (°C). 4. Discussion The present study aimed to develop ML models to simulate almond
    yields in the TM region, applying open and proprietary RS data. The comparison
    was made among various free RS platforms (MODIS Terra LST, GSMaP, Landsat 8, and
    Sentinel-2) and a paid one (PlanetScope). Several ML regression models (RFR, XGBR,
    GBR, BR, ABR) were applied, and the optimum feature combination was selected to
    achieve the best performance. The combination of irrigation data, daytime temperature
    in March, the NDVI in January, and the SAVI in May (from the PlanetScope platform)
    showed the best performance (R2 = 0.80), using the XGBR model. Indeed, the use
    of VIs with a higher resolution (3 m) from the PlanetScope data had a positive
    influence on the almond yield prediction, as the results obtained with Sentinel-2
    (R2 = 0.67—RFR) and Landsat 8 (R2 = 0.72—ABR) data were lower. However, it is
    worth noting that free data with lower resolution could also be a viable alternative
    to PlanetScope, particularly RS platforms providing climatic data, such as MODIS
    Terra LST and GSMaP, achieving an R2 of 0.68 when using the RFR model with irrigation
    and climate data. Regarding the XGBR model, it was observed that the best results
    were reached when using three groups of features (irrigation, climate data, and
    VIs) (R2 = 0.80). On the other hand, the XGBR model obtained inferior performance
    when using only irrigation information (R2: 0.32), only climate data (R2: 0.19),
    or only VIs (PlanetScope—R2 = 0.44). In this case, the RFR model achieved a higher
    level of performance than the XGBR model. This situation might be due to the XGBR
    model being more capable of handling complex relationships between features [45],
    while the RFR model is known to perform better with simpler features. Considering
    other studies related to almond yield prediction, Zhang et al. tested several
    ML models, obtaining the best performance with the SGB model, with an R2 of 0.71,
    which is also a boosting model [20]. Considering the most important features,
    irrigation and daytime temperature in March stood out, highlighting the role of
    water availability and suitable temperatures for almond yields [53]. In fact,
    AG3 and AG4 show higher yield values, due to the available irrigation. Furthermore,
    March is considered a crucial period for almond trees, as flowering occurs at
    this stage [54]. Almond trees are highly sensitive to climatic conditions during
    the flowering period, and adequate temperatures are essential for successful pollination
    and fruit development. According to Tamimi [54], the ideal temperature for almond
    tree flowering during the day is between 15 °C and 30 °C, and temperatures outside
    this range can lead to problems, resulting in reduced fruit production. In effect,
    daytime temperatures in March in the agricultural fields of AG2 were recorded,
    with a minimum temperature of 12.2 °C recorded in 2018, which is below the considered
    ideal temperature for almond flowering, which can explain the low production in
    that year (Supplementary Figure S1). On the other hand, in the agricultural fields
    of AG4, a maximum temperature of 22.5 °C was recorded in 2019, falling within
    the range of ideal temperatures for flowering, resulting in increased production
    that year. Similar studies have also highlighted temperature-related features.
    Zhang et al. [20] emphasized the importance of the feature “long-term mean maximum
    April-June temperature” in predicting almond production. According to the authors,
    this factor significantly affects the blooming period of almond trees. Almonds
    are sensitive to temperature fluctuations during this critical stage, and optimal
    temperatures promote successful pollination and higher yield. However, exceeding
    the temperature threshold can negatively impact pollination and reduce fruit set,
    leading to lower almond yield. Therefore, monitoring and considering the long-term
    mean maximum April-June temperature is essential for accurately predicting almond
    yield. Other studies, such as the study by Tombesi et al. [55], have also considered
    that warm springs accelerate fruit development. The intricate relationships unveiled
    throughout this analysis underscore the necessity of employing sophisticated ML
    models for understanding the dynamics influencing almond production. The interdependence
    of variables like irrigation, climate indicators, and vegetation indices highlights
    the need for advanced analytical tools, and the application of sophisticated machine
    learning (ML) models becomes imperative. Unlike simpler models, such as linear
    regression, which assume linear relationships between the variables, the complexities
    of almond production necessitate more sophisticated approaches. The utilization
    of advanced ML models, like the XGBR model applied in this study, allows for the
    exploration of intricate, non-linear relationships among various contributing
    factors. In the realm of almond production, where variables often exhibit non-linear
    dependencies, these models excel in discerning patterns that may elude simpler
    methodologies. Some limitations must be acknowledged. Optimal results were achieved
    through the utilization of a proprietary/paid platform, potentially limiting accessibility
    for certain users. Furthermore, the lower resolution of data provided by open
    platforms may impede the identification of smaller orchard areas. Nevertheless,
    our study underscores the viability of utilizing freely available remote sensing
    data. While the data were sourced from multiple farmers, expanding the dataset
    could enhance the robustness of our findings. Despite the abovementioned limitations,
    the current study methodology holds promise for adaptation and implementation
    in various agricultural settings worldwide. Another important point is the careful
    analysis of features to increase the overall performance of the ML regression
    models. In this way, this study not only allows for the prediction of almond yields,
    but also enables the identification of the key factors that significantly influence
    these predictions. Furthermore, the models developed allow the implementation
    of early prediction of seasonal almond yields, with the potential integration
    of climate data and extreme weather events. The comparison between open and proprietary
    RS data shows that these models can be implemented using these two types of datasets.
    As such, these results provide valuable insights for farmers and other sector
    stakeholders, in the decision-making process, which can enhance the sustainability
    of the almond sector in Portugal. 5. Conclusions This study investigates the potential
    of RS data and ML models for predicting almond yield. Various RS platforms were
    evaluated, including both freely available platforms, including MODIS Terra LST,
    GSMaP, Landsat 8, and Sentinel-2, as well as a paid platform, PlanetScope. In
    addition, the performance of several ML regressors, including RFR, XGBR, GBR,
    BR, and ABR, were evaluated. The inclusion of high-resolution VIs from the PlanetScope
    platform significantly increased the accuracy of almond yield prediction. The
    XGBR model trained with a feature set comprising irrigation data, the daily temperature
    in March, the NDVI in January, and the SAVI in May from the PlanetScope platform
    showed the highest predictive performance, achieving an R2 value of 0.80. This
    indicates that the model could effectively explain 80% of the variation in the
    almond yield. However, freely available RS platforms, such as MODIS Terra LST
    and GSMaP, can also serve as viable alternatives to PlanetScope data. Despite
    the lower spatial resolution, the data from these platforms demonstrated that
    it still provides valuable insights for predicting almond yield. It is worth noting,
    however, that the choice of ML model was found to be a critical factor in the
    prediction accuracy. While the XGBR model consistently outperformed the other
    models, it proved more prone to noise and outliers when only one or two types
    of features were used. Therefore, the selection of the most suitable ML algorithm
    should be based on the dataset and features to be considered. Irrigation and the
    daytime temperature in March were among the most important features for predicting
    almond yield, highlighting the pivotal role of water and temperature in crop growth
    and development. Future research may be aimed at the continuous improvement of
    the dataset implemented in this study, by increasing the number of almond orchards
    by considering broader geographical areas and including established climatic and
    temporal relationships with the yield in the evaluated orchards. This will improve
    the generalization ability of the models. It would also be useful to consider
    very-high resolution UAV multispectral data to provide tree-level almond yield.

  description: Agriculture is facing the challenge of feeding the ever-growing population
    that is projected to reach ten billion by 2050. While improving crop yield and
    productivity can address this challenge, the increasing effects of global warming
    and climate change seriously threaten agricultural productivity. Thus, genomics
    and genome modification technologies are crucial to improving climate-resilient
    traits to enable sustained yield and productivity; however, significant research
    focuses on staple crops such as rice, wheat, and maize. Crops that are naturally
    climate-resilient and nutritionally superior to staple cereals, such as small
    millets, remain neglected and underutilized by mainstream research. The ability
    of small millets to grow in marginal regions having limited irrigation and poor
    soil fertility makes these crops a better choice for cultivation in arid and semi-arid
    areas. Hence, mainstreaming small millets for cultivation and using omics technologies
    to dissect the climate-resilient traits to identify the molecular determinants
    underlying these traits are imperative for addressing food and nutritional security.
    In this context, the review discusses the genomics and genome modification approaches
    for dissecting key traits in small millets and their application for improving
    these traits in cultivated germplasm. The review also discusses biofortification
    for nutritional security and machine-learning approaches for trait improvement
    in small millets. Altogether, the review provides a roadmap for the effective
    use of next-generation approaches for trait improvement in small millets. This
    will lead to the development of improved varieties for addressing multiple insecurities
    prevailing in the present climate change scenario.

    editingClimate resilienceCrop improvement 1. Introduction Global food security
    and nutritional deficiencies are the two most challenging situations for the growing
    human population. Crop diversification helps to a great extent to achieve food
    security [1]. However, changing climatic conditions significantly influence food
    security by limiting crop production [2]. Globally, malnutrition or hidden hunger
    is another major problem increasing substantially in developing countries. The
    annual monocrops dominating the current agricultural system, such as wheat (Triticum
    spp.), rice (Oryza sativa), and maize (Zea mays), are calorie-dense and require
    extensive inputs of pesticides and fertilizers to maintain the yield every year
    [3]. Additionally, human populations inhabiting Africa and Asia lack access to
    different food crops, and the staple crops consumed by them fall short of supplying
    essential micronutrients, which is the prime cause of malnutrition [4]. In this
    context, crop diversification is the most effective approach to improve resistance
    against biotic factors and tolerance to abiotic stressors, leading to food and
    income security for farmers [5]. Diversifying mainstream staple crops with other
    crops would help achieve nutritional security and sustainable agriculture goals.
    Considering this, millets, also known as nutri-cereals, have the potential to
    provide adequate macro- and micro-nutrients compared to staple crops. Millets
    are a rich source of dietary fibers, essential amino acids and minerals, antioxidants,
    trace elements, protein, fats, and carbohydrates [6]. Additionally, millets have
    exceptional climate resilience traits, enabling them to survive and grow in various
    climatic and soil conditions [7]. Their excellent nutritional profile and climate
    resilience features make millets known as miracle grains [1]. Despite numerous
    superior qualities, millets are underutilized due to the substantial focus on
    major cereal crops worldwide. Thus, millets are referred to as “orphan cereal
    crops” by the scientific community [8]. Developing novel biotechnological approaches
    and breeding technologies provides a platform for exploiting millets'' genetic
    diversity and accelerating trait improvement programs. These tools have the potential
    to mine the gene pools of crops to identify the agronomically important traits
    in millet. Presently the genome sequence of several millet crops is available
    to hasten the progress of crop improvement programs in these crops [[9], [10],
    [11]]. Breeding techniques complemented by new genomic and molecular approaches
    offer a platform to identify candidate genes or markers associated with stress
    tolerance. Several omics studies have been performed in small millets to understand
    stress-related mechanisms [[11], [12], [13], [14], [15]]. Numerous candidate genes
    having roles in yield enhancement, stress resilience, and other important agronomic
    features have been identified in small millets [16,17]. For instance, EcHNRT2,
    EcLNRT1, EcNADH-NR, EcGS, EcFd-GOGAT, and EcDof1 have been identified in finger
    millet to develop NUE (Nitrogen use efficiency) varieties [18]. EcDehydrin7 involved
    in drought stress was identified in finger millet, which could be used to develop
    drought and heat-tolerant crops [19]. SiARDP and SiLEA14, involved in salt and
    drought tolerance, were functionally characterized in foxtail millet [20,21].
    Still, they are waiting for further comprehensive functional characterization
    using advanced biotechnological tools. Novel genome editing tools, such as zinc-finger
    nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) and
    CRISPR/Cas, have been developed to revolutionize the crop improvement approaches
    [22]. However, the use of these technologies in small millets is yet to be standardized.
    Studies on different small millets have provided information about their phenotypic
    diversity, climate resilience features, genome-wide SNP markers, and the heritability
    of different important traits and markers for genetic diversity. However, these
    marker data have not been exploited successfully for improved variety development,
    and low yield remains a challenge for small millet cultivation. Currently, the
    advancement in genomics and genome modification technologies and computer-based
    approaches enables the application of novel tools for the varietal improvement
    of small millets. In this context, the review discusses current trends of next-generation
    tools and their application for small millet improvement. The review also discusses
    the success stories, future aspects, and potential risks of these techniques in
    breeding programs for improvement in small millets. 2. Importance of small millets
    and scope for their improvement ‘Small millets,’ also known as minor millets,
    is a generic name for coarse cereals, mainly cultivated in rain-fed areas of arid
    and semi-arid zones [8]. It includes foxtail millet (Setaria italica), barnyard
    millet (Echinochloa crusgalli), finger millet (Eleusine coracana), proso millet
    (Panicum miliaceum), little millet (Panicum sumatrense), kodo millet (Paspalum
    scrobiculatum), teff (Eragrostis tef), Job''s tears (Coix lacryma-jobi), fonio
    (Digitaria exilis), browntop millet (Urochloa ramosa), and guinea millet (Brachiaria
    deflexa) [8,23]. Small millets belong to the Poaceae family but are superior to
    other major cereals in terms of nutritional qualities, climate resilience, and
    other agronomical traits. In addition, millets have excellent water-use and nitrogen-use
    efficiencies that help them survive under water-deficit conditions in rain-fed
    regions [24]. Given this, millets have a minimum dependency on irrigation and
    nitrogen fertilizers for better yield [25]. Due to their nutritional superiority
    and climate resilience features, small millets can supplement staple cereal crops.
    They are rich in micro- and macro-nutrients, proteins, essential amino acids,
    dietary fiber, and resistant starch (Table 1). In addition, small millets also
    have rich contents of phytochemicals, viz., alkaloids, flavonoids, phenolics,
    and saponins [26]. For example, kodo millet has the maximum content of phenolic
    compounds (10.3%), and finger millet is rich in reducing sugars (391.3 mg/g each)
    [26]. Ferulic acid, predominantly identified as free phenolic fractions, was recorded
    highest in kodo millet (99.35 mg/100 g), followed by finger millet and foxtail
    millet with 57.04 mg/100 g and 54.65 mg/100 g of ferulic acid, respectively [27].
    Similarly, proso millet is the richest source of protein (12,610 mg/100 g) among
    millets [27]. Most small millets are gluten-free and have a low glycemic index
    [28]. However, several antinutrient factors like tannins, polyphenols and phytic
    acid present in millets limit the bioavailability of essential nutrients, hence
    limiting the consumption of millets [29]. It has been estimated that millets have
    0.2–0.3% polyphenols, 0.48% phytates and 0.61% tannins, among which the presence
    of phytic acid is a matter of concern, as it affects the bio-accessibility of
    several major nutrients [30]. Table 1. Nutritional profile of small millet grains

    of small millets is limited to small farmers of low-income countries due to the
    presence of various antinutrients and the limited exploitation of genetic resources
    for trait improvement. However, small millet cultivation provides grains for forage,
    enhances agricultural biodiversity, checks soil erosion in arid regions, and ensures
    higher carbon sequestration due to the C4 mode of photosynthesis [8]. In recent
    years, foxtail millet has emerged as a model crop for C4 plants among small millets.
    It, therefore, enables the breeding programs to explore complex agronomic traits
    in all C4 millet crops [31]. Interestingly, recent research by Yang et al. [32]
    has confirmed the development of mini foxtail millet with a mutation, xiaomi,
    which has a short life cycle and flowering time. This makes the xiaomi mutant
    an Arabidopsis-like C4 model plant. Except for foxtail millet, proso millet, and
    finger millet, inadequate germplasm conservation has been done for other small
    millets, which is a potential reason for limited trait improvement research programs
    on these crops [8]. Therefore, significant efforts must be made in other small
    millets to conserve and explore their germplasm before they are lost. The application
    of novel approaches is imperative to examine the agronomic traits followed by
    their improvement in small millets [33]. Trait improvement in small millets, particularly
    focusing on reducing antinutrients and improving yield, could promote their cultivation
    and consumption as nutri-cereals, which will help combat hidden hunger [33]. Germplasm
    resources of small millets are conserved in genebanks of different regions, led
    by Asian countries with 64.4% accessions [34]. Globally, germplasm resources of
    small millets are majorly conserved in the National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources
    (NBPGR, India), Institute of Crop Science, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences
    (ICS-CAAS), National Institute of Agrobiological Sciences, Japan, and Ethiopian
    Institute of Biodiversity [34]. The availability of genome sequence data of small
    millets can facilitate the development of mapping populations with desired traits.
    The availability of draft genome sequences for most millets is competent for large-scale
    genotyping and gene mining. For example, ICRISAT, in collaboration with Cornell
    University, has genotyped different small millets using genotyping-by-sequencing
    (GBS) and identified diversity in small millet population structure [35]. However,
    ploidy level and the presence of repetitive DNA greatly influence the success
    of genome sequencing in small millets. The emerging next-generation sequencing
    approaches complemented with extensive data analysis platforms are expected to
    provide great success in future. Further, the All India Coordinated Research Project
    on Small Millets (AICRP-Small millets) is actively performing small millet improvements
    through collaborative interaction of State Agricultural Universities, ICAR institutes
    and other voluntary centres [34]. Thus far, this coordinated effort has successfully
    released 248 varieties of small millets in India [36] (http://www.aicrpsm.res.in/).
    Prior to the genome sequence of small millets, molecular markers such as RAPD,
    RFLP, AFLP and SSRs were used to map genes associated with important traits. However,
    advanced genome sequencing approaches have enhanced the direct identification
    of genes. To date, several gene families have been identified and functionally
    characterized, such as MYB, NAC, WRKY, CDPK, WD40, AP2/ERF, ATG and LIM genes
    (Fig. 1) [[37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43]]. Additionally, several other
    stress-related genes have been identified, most of which have been studied in
    foxtail millet and finger millet. For example, SiLEA14 was significantly up-regulated
    in foxtail millet under osmotic and salt stress conditions [21]. Notably, seven
    drought stress-related proteins, namely, NAC2, U2-snRNP (small nuclear RiboNucleoProtein
    particles), CDPK, synaptotagmin, Aquaporins, MPK17-1 and Scythe protein, have
    been identified in small millets [44]. Further, EcDehydrin7, Ec-apx1, EcbHLH57,
    EcbZIP60, Ec-apx1, EcGBF3 and EcbZIP17 have been identified in finger millet,
    and their role in conferring stress tolerance has been studied in various model
    plants such as tobacco and Arabidopsis (Fig. 1) [45]. Download : Download high-res

    stress conditions. 3. Factors limiting the yield and productivity of small millets
    Due to their diverse climate resilience features, small millets are mainly grown
    in arid and semi-arid regions. Of the total area under millets (76 million ha),
    18–20 million ha is utilized worldwide for small millets cultivation [34]. Though
    biotic and abiotic stresses least influence small millets, a significant variation
    exists among different germplasms for stress tolerance in small millets [46].
    Therefore, identifying and applying agronomically important traits for millet
    breeding programs is imperative. Several abiotic stresses, namely, drought, salinity,
    heat, lodging, etc., and biotic stresses, viz., fungal and bacterial diseases,
    significantly influence the small millet productivity (Fig. 2). Download : Download
    high-res image (753KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Environmental
    stresses affecting small millets. Different abiotic and biotic factors that limits
    the yield and productivity of small millets is shown. Also, the anti-nutrients
    in millets are highlighted. 3.1. Water deficit stress Water scarcity is the most
    eminent problem in arid and semi-arid regions of many countries, which leads to
    severe drought stress in those areas. On a report by the United Nations, approximately
    40% of the world''s land is dry, which feeds almost 2 billion people [47]. Notably,
    the severity and frequency of drought stress have enhanced hitherto [48]. As the
    dominant crops of these areas, small millets production is adversely affected
    by drought stress. Ajithkumar et al. (2014) [49] showed a negative impact of drought
    stress on yield, membrane integrity, osmotic balance, water potential maintenance,
    and photosynthetic efficiency in pearl millet. Similarly, teff production is limited
    by drought conditions, which needs immediate action to improve mitigation and
    adaptation strategies [50]. Further, Matsuura and the research group [51] examined
    the impact of water deficit conditions on the vegetative and reproductive stages
    of proso millet, foxtail millet, and little millet. The foxtail millet showed
    an 80% reduction in yield after drought treatment at the pre-heading stage, whereas
    proso millet and little millet showed a 36 and 20% yield reduction [51]. Although
    post-heading drought stress leads to severely reduced productivity in proso and
    little millet only, minor impact was observed in foxtail millet. Therefore, the
    study suggested that foxtail millet has better drought tolerance mechanisms than
    proso and little millet. Further, drought stress in finger millet resulted in
    complete yield loss [52], and almost 77% of yield loss was reported in teff after
    confronting drought stress at the heading stage of growth [53]. Winkel et al.
    (1997) [54] investigated the adverse effect of drought conditions on different
    stages of pearl millet. They concluded that yield loss is severe when it experiences
    drought at the reproductive stage. The yield loss in millets varies yearly based
    on the drought stress severity; however, millets produce grains even under severe
    drought conditions, unlike other major cereals. Numerous agronomical traits are
    responsible for the drought tolerance features of small millets. Traits responsible
    for nitrogen-use efficiency, photosynthetic efficiency, early flowering, and rapid
    growth are important factors that help them escape drought conditions [55]. Other
    traits associated with water-use efficiency helps millets avoid drought stress
    by maintaining the water potential in cells [56]. Similarly, superior antioxidant
    qualities and osmolyte accumulation confer drought tolerance in millets [55].
    In addition, several morphological, physiological, and biochemical traits have
    been identified in millets that are crucial for their drought tolerance. For example,
    Balsamo et al. (2006) [57] reported that bundle sheath lignification enhances
    teff tensile strength. Further, enhanced accumulation of osmolytes was observed
    in little millet under drought conditions [49]. Root architecture is another important
    morphological characteristic to survive drought conditions. Therefore, broader
    root architecture in teff allows it to survive drought stress [58,59]. Considering
    this, millets are widely grown in rain-fed regions of various developing countries.
    3.2. Salinity stress Salinity is a major problem in the irrigated area of agricultural
    lands, severely affecting crop yield and nutritional status. Currently, almost
    45 mha of total irrigated land is affected by salinity [60]. Millets are also
    categorized as glycophytes as they are not resistant to high salt concentrations
    [61]. Given this, Rasool et al. (2020) [62] and Shah et al. (2020) [63] investigated
    the effect of salinity on foxtail millet. Due to salt stress, they reported reduced
    biomass, photosynthetic efficiency, and water potential. Finger millet is salt
    tolerant, ensuring grain production under saline conditions [64]. Several finger
    millet genotypes have been investigated for their salt tolerance ability, which
    reported significant genotype-based variation in terms of tolerance in finger
    millet [65]. Salt stress adversely affects germination and seedling development
    in finger millet [66]. Similarly, four foxtail millet genotypes were investigated
    for their salt tolerance and showed variable morphological and anatomical changes
    among the sensitive and tolerant cultivars [67]. Further, a study by Rahim et
    al. (2020) [68] assessed the salt tolerance ability of pearl millet and showed
    a reduction in the number of tillers and growth under high salt concentrations.
    3.3. Temperature stress Millets are heat tolerant; however, several molecular
    changes are induced under high temperatures. For example, photosynthetic efficiency,
    transpiration, and respiration are major biological processes that are sensitive
    to temperature and significantly impact yield [69]. Therefore, the annual rise
    in global temperature greatly influences crop productivity, which threatens food
    security. Finger millet cultivars are widely grown in areas with a maximum temperature
    of 36 °C; however, a further rise in temperature adversely affects yield [70].
    The study reported significant variation in the germination of different germplasms
    of finger millet under increased temperature, suggesting the need for improved
    genotype development by breeding programs [70]. Further, pearl millet can produce
    grains at temperature up to 42 °C, where other crops fail to grow. However, changing
    climatic conditions and further increase in temperature will reduce the yield
    of pearl millet by 17% by 2050 [71]. Similarly, Knox et al. [72] estimated approximately
    a 10% loss in the yield of pearl millet in Asian regions. Djanaguiraman et al.
    [73] quantified the impact of high temperature on pollen, pistil, and germplasm
    variability. 3.4. Waterlogging stress Waterlogging is a major stress in areas
    with heavy precipitation that adversely impacts stomatal closure, photosynthesis,
    and root architecture by inhibiting gas diffusion [74]. Waterlogging causes almost
    16% of yield loss in proso millet [74]. Similarly, a reduction in the yield of
    finger millet was reported under waterlogging, as it favours an anaerobic mode
    of metabolism that is not very economical in terms of ATP production [75]. Matsuura
    et al. (2016) [76] investigated the effect of waterlogging on proso millet, little
    millet, and foxtail millet and suggested that little millet showed better waterlogging
    tolerance than other millets. 3.5. Lodging effect Lodging, bending of the stem,
    is a severe problem in many small millet crops, which causes severe yield loss.
    Several climatic conditions, such as rain, wind, irrigation, or combined effect,
    can lead to lodging in millets. Lodging stress majorly influences the stem and
    root of the plant, hence regarded as stem lodging and root lodging, respectively
    [77]. Numerous studies have shown the negative impact of lodging stress on teff
    and foxtail millet. Teff is majorly susceptible to root lodging [78]. Similarly,
    lodging stress causes yield loss in foxtail millet [79]. Further, Opole et al.
    [80] showed the role of excessive fertilizer in causing lodging stress in finger
    millet, which severely reduces the yield. However, pearl millet showed tolerance
    to the lodging effect [81]. 4. Biotic factors affecting small millets Under vulnerable
    conditions, various biotic factors cause heavy losses in small millet production.
    Several pathogens such as Rhizoctonia solani, Pyricularia grisea, Pyricularia
    setariae, Ustilago crus-galli, Sphacelotheca destruens, Uromyces linearis, Uromyces
    eragrostidis, etc. have been reported in small millets [46] (Table 2). Among various
    pathogens, fungal diseases are more devastative for small millets, as they have
    broad spectrum of host. For example, smut and rust are commonly known to infect
    all the small millets including teff [46]. However, other diseases such as blast,
    leaf blight, udbatta, sheath rot, sheath blight and brown spot specifically infect
    one or few small millets [46]. Severe yield losses have been reported in small
    millets due to these pathogens. For example, 30–40% grain loss was reported in
    foxtail millet due to blast [82]. Similarly, blast disease causes over 50% loss
    of finger millet [83]. Blast disease caused by P. grisea, infects several small
    millets, including foxtail millet, finger millet, proso millet, barnyard millet
    and little millet. The average yield loss due to blast infection may extend to
    90% in affected areas [84]. Further, teff rust is responsible for 10–40% yield
    losses annually [85]. Downy mildew of finger millet causes severe losses, with
    more than 50% yield loss in certain years [46]. Ragi mottle streak virus infects
    finger millet in India, where yield loss ranged from 50% to 100% in some affected
    regions [46]. Leaf blight is another common fungal disease of small millets. The
    fungi for blight disease in different small millets are Alternaria tenuissima
    (kodo millet), Cochliobolus setariae (foxtail millet), Drechslera nodulosa (little
    millet, tef), Exserohilum monoceras (barnyard millet), and Bipolaris panici-miliacei
    (proso millet) [46]. Several different fungi, such as Uromyces eragrostidis, Uromyces
    setariae-italicae, Uromyces linearis and Puccinia substriata are known to cause
    rust in small millets such as foxtail millet, finger millet, kodo millet and little
    millet [46]. Similarly, grain smut is a common disease of barnyard millet, little
    millet, finger millet and foxtail millet, whereas head smut majorly infects kodo
    millet, proso millet and teff [46]. Among small millets, no significant information
    is available about the disease of teff and fonio. Table 2. Common pathogens reported
    to cause diseases in small millets [184]. Crop Disease Pathogen Finger millet

    5. Antinutrient content in small millet grains Small millets are a rich source
    of various micro- and macro-nutrients, therefore considered important cereals
    to combat hidden hunger. However, different antinutrients such as tannins, polyphenols,
    and phytic acid reduce millets'' nutritional qualities as they chelate various
    crucial cations like K+, Mg2+, Zn2+, and Ca2+ in the human body after consumption
    [86]. This activity reduces the bioavailability of these cations to several important
    enzymes and hampers the biological process mediated by these enzymes. Additionally,
    various enzyme inhibitors, such as amylase and protease inhibitors, cause indigestion
    of millet grains [87]. These anti-nutritional qualities of millets are also important
    reasons for their orphan status and ignorance by agricultural communities. Further,
    these anti-nutrients also reduce the bioavailability of several nutrients and
    minerals, which leads to harmful effects on the health of people whose nutritional
    requirements solely depend on these crops [29]. Kumar et al. [88] reported the
    presence of various anti-nutrients such as oxalates, phytic acid, non-starch polysaccharides-glucans,
    tannins, and protease inhibitors in finger millet. Earlier, Ramachandra et al.
    [89] investigated the content of tannins in finger millet and identified it to
    be in the range of 0.04–3.47%. However, varietal variation of tannin content was
    observed, therefore paving the path for germplasm improvement. Similarly, protease
    inhibitor activity and non-starch polysaccharides contents have been identified
    in various finger millet varieties [90,91]. Pradeep and Sreerama [92] investigated
    the effect of various treatments on the anti-nutrient composition of barnyard
    millet, proso millet, and foxtail millet. Currently, several processing techniques,
    such as decortication, germination, milling, roasting, puffing, cooking, and hydrothermal
    treatments, are widely utilized to reduce the anti-nutrients in millets [93].
    Numerous studies have reported the success of these techniques in different millets
    [[94], [95], [96], [97]]. However, these techniques also cause a significant reduction
    in other nutrients and minerals [95,98]. Therefore, genetic approaches to enhance
    the bioavailability of nutrients and reduce anti-nutrients are imperative for
    increasing these crops'' popularity and consumption. 6. Genetic and genomic resources
    Crop diversity is a primary requirement for sustainable agriculture and nutritional
    security. Diverse germplasm provides significant variability for crop improvement.
    Globally, approximately 133,849 accessions of small millets are conserved in genebanks
    (Supplementary Fig. S1) [34]. ICRISAT conserves around 10,193 germplasm accessions
    of all small millets from 50 countries [99]. Around 29,000 accessions of proso
    millet have been conserved worldwide, of which 849 germplasm are conserved at
    the International Crops Research Institute for Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) [100].
    Over 8000 germplasm accessions each of kodo and barnyard millet, and around 3000
    germplasm of little millet have been successfully stored in genebank [101]. Small
    millet crops are majorly tetraploid, except in foxtail millet and barnyard millet,
    which have diploid and hexaploidy levels, respectively [34]. These large collections
    of conserved small millet genotypes are grouped according to various parameters,
    such as region of origin and promising traits, by the genebank institutions like
    ICRISAT [99]. Each group represents a particular genetic diversity called “core
    collection” [99]. These core collections provide sufficient genetic diversity
    for crop improvement. The genetic diversity of small millets has been investigated
    with the help of several genetic markers, such as genome-wide small nucleotide
    polymorphism (SNP) markers (Table 3). This is facilitated by novel sequencing
    approaches such as genotyping by sequencing (GBS), restriction site-associated
    DNA (RAD) sequencing and whole genome resequencing [102]. Yue et al. (2016) [103]
    identified about 400,000 SNP markers and 35,000 simple-sequence repeats (SSRs)
    from proso millets. Similarly, random-amplification-of-polymorphic DNA (RAPD)
    markers have been identified in 96 kodo millet accessions [104]. Recently, the
    genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) approach was used to identify novel SNP markers
    in 288 finger millet accessions from Zimbabwe and Ethiopia [105]. Around 2412
    high-quality SNP markers were identified in proso millet, followed by a genome-wide
    association study to understand the genetic diversity among different accessions
    of proso millet from Western Europe, Eastern Asia, Americas, Southern Asia, Western
    Asia and Africa [106]. Further, 2977 SNP markers were used for a marker-trait
    association study in finger millet to understand the genetic diversity associated
    with seed protein content, grain yield and days to maturity [107]. Additionally,
    advanced phenomics methods could be integrated with genomics data to enhance the
    study of a diverse genetic pool of small millets. Thus, huge opportunities are
    available for researchers to unveil the genetic diversity of small millets, which
    certainly encourages crop improvement programs in millets. Table 3. Molecular

    [196] 7. Dissecting climate-resilient and nutritional traits in small millets
    Millets exhibit several important nutritional and climate-resilient traits, which
    have been identified so far by using novel omics and breeding approaches. Modern
    genetic and genomic tools facilitate the identification of these traits. The availability
    of whole genome sequence information of several small millets has further accelerated
    the crop improvement programs in millets [8]. As climate-resilient crops, millets
    are underexplored in this regard, though the looming climate changes necessitate
    trait improvement practices to be deployed to avoid crop failure [108]. Both genomic
    and genetic resources are necessary for trait improvement, where genomic information
    accelerate the identification and functional characterization of trait-responsive
    genes for their utilization in breeding programs (Fig. 3; Supplementary Fig. S2).
    Among small millets, the whole genome sequence is available for foxtail millet,
    finger millet, barnyard millet, teff, and green foxtail [9,11,[109], [110], [111]]
    (Fig. 4; Supplementary Table S1). This breakthrough research expedites the identification
    of novel genes responsible for various nutritional and climate resilience traits
    in small millets (Table 4). The availability of genomic resources has accelerated
    breeding programs targeting trait improvement in small millets. Genome-wide association
    study identified ten loci associated with nutritional elements, including calcium,
    zinc, phosphorus, sulfur, magnesium, boron, nickel, potassium, and manganese [112].
    GWAS, through the GBS-ddRAD approach, identified markers associated with various
    traits such as grain yield (GY), flag leaf width (FLW), thousand-grain weight
    (TGW), etc. [113]. The Pearl Millet Inbred Germplasm Association Panel (PMiGAP)
    has collected 29 million genome-wide SNPs, which have been utilized to map various
    traits such as Fe and Zn content in grain, tolerance to drought yield, nitrogen-use
    efficiency, etc. [114]. Genetic loci associated with nitrogen responsiveness and
    yield traits have recently been identified in foxtail millet through GWAS [115].
    Further, integrated breeding associated with genomics facilitated the identification
    of genetic factors related to seed protein content (SPC), grain yield (GY), and
    days to maturity (DM) in finger millet [107]. Similarly, genetic regulation of
    micronutrient content was studied by genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) and GWAS to
    identify candidate genes associated with traits in finger millet [116]. Download

    Different “omics” approaches, including transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics,
    enable the quantitative and qualitative analysis of candidate genes to unravel
    the underlying regulatory networks (Fig. 3). RNA-seq analysis of little millet
    identified drought- and salt-responsive genes, which can be used as potential
    crop improvement candidates [15]. Similarly, the transcriptome analysis of finger
    millet reported several genes associated with drought tolerance and nutraceutical
    properties, which could be used as candidates for breeding programs [11]. Further,
    de novo transcriptome sequencing of pearl millet identified salt-responsive genes
    [117]. Another study by Jaiswal et al. (2018) [118] reported transcriptomic signatures
    associated with drought tolerance. Recently, small RNA sequencing analysis revealed
    the function of miRNAs under salt stress and identified their potential targets
    in pearl millet [119]. Rahman et al. [120] identified salinity-responsive candidate
    genes such as transporters, stress-related TFs, aquaporins, sodium/calcium exchangers,
    and signal transducers in finger millet through RNA sequencing. EcbZIP17 from
    finger millet showed increased growth and stress tolerance under abiotic stresses
    [121]. The study identified a NAC (no apical meristem) TF, EcNAC67, further functionally
    characterized in rice using Agrobacterium-mediated transformation [122]. Transcriptomics
    analysis identified 82 genes encoding calcium sensors in developing spikes of
    finger millet [123]. Recently, a presumptive model for calcium transport, known
    as the ‘Tripartite model,’ was suggested in finger millet [124]. Proteomics is
    another popular omics approach, which is now widely employed in millets to understand
    climate resilience and nutrition-associated traits. For example, comparative proteomics
    analysis identified drought-responsive proteins in foxtail millet [125]. Integrating
    large-scale data from all the omics approaches would facilitate the identification
    of potential candidate genes that could be manipulated using novel gene-editing
    tools to develop improved crops. Genomic studies in small millets have identified
    several potential markers associated with disease resistance. Field screening
    has been widely used for screening disease resistance germplasms in small millet
    [82]. However, these approaches are time-consuming and demand novel phenomics
    and computational approaches to screening resistant germplasms. Babu et al. [126]
    identified 58 SSR (simple sequence repeats) markers associated with blast resistance
    in finger millet. Recently, a genome-wide association study in foxtail millet
    identified markers associated with blast resistance [127]. Further, QTLs linked
    with blast resistance in finger millet were identified through association mapping
    [128]. Functional molecular markers-based resistance genes (R-genes) analogues
    were identified in finger millet [129]. However, the lack of a complete genome
    sequence in most small millets hinders the identification of genetic and genomic
    resources related to disease resistance. Therefore, new-generation biotechnological
    tools and computational approaches have great potential to accelerate such studies
    and crop improvement programs in small millets. 8. Next-generation tools for trait
    improvement in small millets The improvement of small millets could be a milestone
    in the “New Green Revolution”- a terminology coined to contemplate novel strategies
    of crop improvement which are necessary to combat the complex challenges of climate
    change and malnutrition. In the last few decades, attempts have been made to improve
    the traits and yield of millets. For example, the comprehensive evolution of pearl
    millet breeding from an open-pollinated to a hybrid approach has led to approximately
    a 4% enhancement in pearl millet yield [130]. Further, mutation-breeding in kodo
    millet has developed non-lodging cultivars, as lodging is a major constraint in
    its cultivation [131]. Classical breeding programs such as traditional, mutation,
    and transgenic breeding are very laborious and challenging (Fig. 3). Therefore,
    new breeding techniques assisted by gene editing (GE), epigenetic modification,
    and heritable targeted mutation must be applied for crop improvement. Advanced
    omics have provided substantial genetic and genomic resources, which can be exploited
    for genetic manipulation using third-generation gnome-editing tools [132]. Clustered
    regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein
    9 (Cas9) nuclease system is a powerful gene-editing tool, which is now successfully
    employed in various crops, including rice (Oryza sativa [133], wheat (Triticum
    aestivum [134]) and maize (Zea mays [132]). However, this gene-editing tool has
    not been used for most small millet crops except foxtail millet [135] (Table 5).
    In this direction, a foxtail millet mutant, xiaomi, with a short generation time,
    was developed using the CRISPR system [32]. This mutant provides an efficient
    C4 model system, which can be utilized to study genes associated with important
    agronomic traits. Recently, a nano-particle based delivery system for plasmids,
    ribonucleoproteins (RNPs), and RNA is now developed for speedy trait improvement.
    However, this concept has not been utilized in millets, but this approach holds
    a promising future in these crops. Table 5. Summary of genome-editing experiments
    performed in foxtail millet. Genome editing approach Transformation procedure

    SiPHYC Light receptor for photoperiod flowering Early flowering (heading date
    of 39 days) [32] The genetic manipulation of QTLs is challenging, though GE tools
    showed promising potential in QTLs editing to instigate desired alleles into several
    crops by eluding the requirement of excessive crossing [136]. For example, the
    CRISPR/Cas9 nuclease system facilitated the analysis of phenotypic variation generated
    by mutations in the cis-regulatory region in tomato [137]. Therefore, the CRISPR
    strategy could be employed to genetically manipulate multiple QTLs to produce
    desired phenotypic changes. Further, the generation of double haploids (DH) drastically
    reduces the generation times, thereby speeding up breeding [136]. Given this,
    the haploid inducer line of foxtail millet has been generated by CRISPR-Cas9 mediated
    manipulation of the SiMTL gene [138]. These doubled haploid lines provide a platform
    to exploit complex traits, including climate resilience, in C4 crops. This gene-editing
    assisted de novo domestication of polygenic traits such as climate resilience,
    and nutritional aspect is a new-generation breeding strategy for crops like small
    millets. Developing an efficient transformation and regeneration method is necessary
    for the successful generation of transgenics by gene editing. Though millets lag
    on efficient transformation, few millet transformation reports are available [139,140].
    For example, Agrobacterium-mediated transformation and regeneration of transgenics
    have been performed in finger millet [[141], [142], [143]]. Latha et al. (2005)
    [144] reported the first transgenic finger millet harbouring prawn pin gene encoding
    PIN fungicide protein, which conferred resistance in response to Pyricularia grisea.
    Similarly, transgenic finger millet expressing rice chitinase (chi11) was developed
    through Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, which showed resistance against
    leaf blast disease [142]. Few other studies reported the development of transgenic
    finger millet showing salt and drought tolerance through expressing serine-rich
    protein (PcSrp) and mannitol-1-phosphate dehydrogenase (mtlD) [66,145]. Ramegowda
    et al. [146] reported the successful development of transgenic finger millet plants,
    f35S and fBx17, expressing OsZIP1, which showed significantly enhanced Zn and
    Mn accumulation in finger millet. Following this, a salt-tolerant transgenic finger
    millet overexpressing the vacuolar pyrophosphate (SbVPPase) gene from Sorghum
    bicolor was developed through Agrobacterium-mediated transformation [147]. Satish
    et al. (2017) [143] developed an improved Agrobacterium-mediated transformation
    for finger millet, which showed better regeneration in four finger millet cultivars.
    Further, several reports of foxtail transformation are also available [148,149].
    Successful transformation using the biolistic method is reported in pearl millet
    [149]. Similarly, the biolistic method-based transformation has also been tested
    in barnyard millet [150]. Recently, Agrobacterium-mediated transformation has
    been reported in kodo millet [151]. Therefore, these successful attempts could
    set a platform to extend these studies to other small millet crops, accelerating
    their improvement. Understanding the genetic diversity of cultivated lines is
    a crucial part of crop improvement. Resequencing of cultivated lines of several
    crops such as maize, soybean, and rice has been performed to explore the genetic
    diversity in terms of SNPs and small insertions/deletions (InDels) that are utilized
    as markers in genomics-assisted breeding (GAB) [152,153]. Given this, the concept
    of pangenome has been introduced to capture comprehensive genetic diversities
    in a species. Recently, the super-pangenome approach has been developed, which
    means pangenome analysis of pangenomes of various species to explore genetic diversity
    at the genus level [154]. Despite its significant application in crop improvement,
    crop pangenomics has not been utilized with small millets. Therefore, pangenomics
    of wild varieties of small millets could help explore the complete genetic diversity
    of a genus level, accelerating the small millet improvement programs. 9. Biofortification
    of small millets for nutritional security Malnutrition is a major threat in the
    developing world, where cereals are the primary source of nutrients. Besides major
    cereals, millets are the major crops cultivated and consumed in semi-arid areas
    of developing countries. The superior nutritional qualities of millets proved
    their potential to combat hidden hunger. However, the presence of antinutrients
    restrains the bioavailability of essential nutrients after consumption. Till now,
    the biofortification of major cereals has been widely performed to enhance the
    nutritional qualities of these crops [86]. Subsequently, the biofortification
    of millets was also initiated to achieve enhanced accumulation and bioavailability
    of nutrients in millet grains [86]. At present, germplasm conservation for most
    small millets has been performed in various countries where India has maximum
    accessions [34]. However, the lack of germplasm functional characterization for
    nutrients-associated traits limits the biofortification attempts. Millets are
    a rich source of carbohydrates, and grains with 0% amylose are highly recommended
    for infants due to their easy digestibility [86]. However, a lack of information
    about molecular markers associated with the waxy gene in millets hampers the breeding
    programs to develop waxy mutants. Therefore, next-generation sequencing approaches
    could provide the genetic structure of waxy genes in millets [155]. Further, novel
    gene-editing techniques can generate targeted mutations in non-waxy cultivars
    for developing waxy cultivars. In this regard, molecular analysis of proso millet,
    foxtail millet, and barnyard millet has identified mutations in alleles of waxy
    genes [86,156]. The deficiency of essential amino acids in cereal proteins leads
    to malnutrition. Millets are a rich source of essential amino acids, where finger
    millet has the highest content [157]. Therefore, finger millet has excellent potential
    to be utilized as a model crop to understand the genetic mechanism of protein
    quality. Kemper et al. [158] identified a gene, o2 modifier (Opm), involved in
    the modulation of amino acid catabolism, which results in the accumulation of
    free lysine and tryptophan in the endosperm. Hence, molecular characterization
    of Opm genes using new advanced biotech approaches will lead to genetic improvement
    of other cereals and small millets. Further, advanced computational approaches
    have identified 16 prolamin-encoding genes in foxtail millet, which could be used
    as a candidate to enhance protein quality in other small millets [159]. Further,
    the accumulation of micronutrients such as zinc and iron can be improved in cereals
    and small millets by overexpressing zinc and iron transporters [146]. Similarly,
    calcium deficiency can be improved as advanced sequencing approaches have identified
    several calcium sensor genes in small millets [160]. Therefore, the expression
    and engineering of these calcium sensor genes will help develop calcium-fortified
    crops. As millets have great synteny with cereals, comparative genomics analysis
    with available genome sequence information of foxtail millet and other cereals
    facilitates the identification of orthologous genes associated with several important
    traits [34]. 10. Future of machine learning (ML) approaches for small millets
    improvement The modern scenario demands the optimization of large-scale data generated
    from numerous omics approaches in the agricultural sector. The big data produced
    by various techniques are difficult to manage because of their “5-V” requirements;
    1) Velocity, 2) Volume, 3) Variety, 4) Veracity, and 5) Value [161]. Earlier,
    conventional statistical methods were extensively used to analyze the genetic
    diversity, genotypes of crops, yield components, climate resilience, the impact
    of biotic stress, parental combinations in hybrid breeding, and in vitro biotechnological
    approaches [162]. However, these conventional methods have low efficacy, as the
    large-scale data from genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and
    phenomics are non-deterministic and non-linear [162]. Machine learning, a subset
    of artificial intelligence, has a significant advantage over conventional methods.
    It can precisely differentiate the plant genotypes based on phenotypical and molecular
    markers and predict the critical quantitative traits for optimization in vitro
    breeding methods [162] (Fig. 5). The newly developed phenomics era is also greatly
    supported by machine learning algorithms. Different sets of algorithms are used
    to analyze nonlinear data from plant studies. For example, deep learning convolutional
    neural networks (CNN) facilitate automated phenotyping and disease assessment
    in plants [163]. Production and yield forecasting is another application of machine
    learning. Given this, artificial neural networks (ANN) of machine learning showed
    better performance than classical methods in the production forecasting of pearl
    millet in Karnataka [164]. Recently, the “Automatic and Intelligent Data Collector
    and Classifier” was developed by integrating IoT (Internet of Things) and the
    deep learning approach of machine learning to automatically gather the images
    and parametric data from rust and blast-infected pearl millet crops [165]. Similarly,
    a machine learning algorithm, deep learning CNN, was used to identify mildew disease
    in pearl millet [166]. Another quality testing system, “Mixed Cropping Seed Classifier
    and Quality Tester (MCSCQT)”, was developed to classify diseased and normal pearl
    millet and maize seeds [167]. Further, an artificial neural network (ANN) machine
    learning algorithm was used to develop a model to help farmers predict the suitable
    crop during the cropping season by using soil conditions and climatic parameters
    as input [168]. Interestingly, machine learning approaches have applications in
    predicting the nutrient use efficiencies of crops under field conditions [169].
    The major application of machine learning in agriculture has been dedicated to
    disease and weed detection; however, its implementation in small millet cropping
    is still lacking. Therefore, a great scope of application of these novel computational
    techniques in small millet improvement exists. Download : Download high-res image

    prospective of millet omics Small millets ensure food sustainability due to their
    inherent climate-resilient features and nutritional superiority compared to rice
    and wheat. Therefore, crop diversification is essential to attain food and nutritional
    security in the current scenario. However, low yield, lack of genomic and genetic
    resources, and presence of several anti-nutrients demand the deployment of advanced
    biotechnology-based crop improvement approaches to enhance the cultivation of
    small millets. Owing to this, significant progress has been made in generating
    enormous genomic and genetic resources for these crops, which led to identifying
    several agronomically important traits that can be used for small millet improvement.
    Conventional breeding approaches have developed several cultivars of small millet
    with improved climate-resilience features, disease resistance, nutritional quality,
    yield, improved biomass, and stover quality [[170], [171], [172], [173]]. Currently,
    248 varieties of six small millets (finger millet, foxtail millet, proso millet,
    kodo millet, barnyard millet, and little millet) in India and 19 proso millet
    in the USA have been released through landraces selection, pedigree selection,
    and mutation breeding [34]. Interestingly, several stress-tolerance and nutritional
    quality-related genes identified from small millets have been expressed in other
    crops, suggesting the applicability of their genetic resources in other crops.
    For example, the remorin encoding gene (SiREM6) from foxtail millet showed salt
    tolerance in Arabidopsis on overexpression [174]. Recently, overexpression of
    SiMYB3 in rice and Arabidopsis conferred tolerance to low nitrogen stress by improving
    the root architecture [175]. Similarly, overexpression of SiMYB19 enhances yield
    and salt tolerance in transgenic rice [176]. SiMYB56 overexpression in rice conferred
    drought tolerance at the reproductive and vegetative stages [177]. Overexpression
    of EcDehydrin7 from finger millet conferred drought tolerance in tobacco [178].
    Late embryogenic abundant (LEA) protein-encoding gene, SiLEA14, from foxtail millet,
    conferred salt and osmotic stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis and foxtail
    millet [21]. Numerous other studies have reported the functional characterization
    of important genes from small millets in other crops [[179], [180], [181], [182],
    [183], [211], [214], [215], [216], [217], [218], [219], [220], [221], [222], [223],
    [224], [225], [226], [227], [228], [229], [230]]. However, such efforts are lacking
    in small millets due to the absence of standardized transformation methods. Further,
    despite the availability of advanced breeding approaches, very limited trait improvement
    efforts have been made in most small millets, including fonio, guinea millet,
    browntop millet, and job''s tears. This is mainly due to meagre germplasm conservation
    for these small millets, which restrains crop improvement efforts. However, the
    high-quality cross-transferability of markers demonstrates the potential scope
    of marker-assisted breeding in small millets crops with limited genomic resources.
    Conventional breeding programs have shown significant success in delivering improved
    cultivars of small millets, though many have to be explored in these crops. The
    advanced sequencing approaches could be employed to provide a complete genome
    sequence of several small millets, including kodo millet, job''s tears, and little
    millet. Additionally, novel machine learning-assisted phenomics approaches could
    further accelerate the collection of genetic diversity data. Given the current
    looming climatic conditions and increasing malnutrition, the agricultural community
    has increased its focus on small millet improvement to achieve food, nutrition,
    and economic security. Author contribution statement All authors listed have significantly

  description: Sorghum is emerging as a model crop for functional genetics and genomics
    of tropical grasses with abundant uses, including food, feed, and fuel, among
    others. It is currently the fifth most significant primary cereal crop. Crops
    are subjected to various biotic and abiotic stresses, which negatively impact
    on agricultural production. Developing high-yielding, disease-resistant, and climate-resilient
    cultivars can be achieved through marker-assisted breeding. Such selection has
    considerably reduced the time to market new crop varieties adapted to challenging
    conditions. In the recent years, extensive knowledge was gained about genetic
    markers. We are providing an overview of current advances in sorghum breeding
    initiatives, with a special focus on early breeders who may not be familiar with
    DNA markers. Advancements in molecular plant breeding, genetics, genomics selection,
    and genome editing have contributed to a thorough understanding of DNA markers,
    provided various proofs of the genetic variety accessible in crop plants, and
    have substantially enhanced plant breeding technologies. Marker-assisted selection
    has accelerated and precised the plant breeding process, empowering plant breeders
    all around the world.

    is one annual grass from the Poaceae family with C4 metabolism. The plant first
    appeared 8,000–5,000 B.C. in Northeastern Africa (Mann et al., 1983). That region
    contains the greatest diversity of cultivated and wild sorghum species. Posterior
    cultivation was found 4,500 B.C. in Western Rojdi, Saurashtra, India (Vavilov
    et al., 1992; Damania, 2002). That cereal is the fifth most important cereal crop
    in the world. Sorghum is a rich protein and fiber source (Khalid et al., 2022),
    and it has great calcium, phosphorus and potassium, but low sodium contents compared
    to rice and wheat (Rao, 2019). Preparations based on sorghum flour (i.e., bread,
    biscuit, pasta, pastry, and porridge) are suitable for a gluten-free diet. Sorghum
    is not only a major food crop, but also grown for the production of alcohol, bioethanol
    and fuel. The Sorghum genus is separated into five taxonomic subgenera or sections:
    Eu-Sorghum, Chaetosorghum, Heterosorghum, Para-Sorghum and Stiposorghum (Figure
    1) (Garber, 1950). The first one includes all cultivated varieties and landraces
    of S. bicolor subsp. bicolor, as well as the wild and weed species S. halepense
    (L.) Pers. (Johnsons grass), S. propinquum (Kunth) Hitchc, S. almum Parodi, S.
    drummondii (Steud.) Millsp. and Chase, and S. arundinaceum (Desv.) Stapf. (the
    known progenitor of S. bicolor) (de Wet and Harlan, 1971; Doggett, 1988). The
    other four sections contain 19 wild species native of Africa, Asia and Australia
    (Garber, 1950; Lazarides et al., 1991). The wild sorghum was first utilized as
    nourishment, 7,500 B.C. in the Sahara region (Venkateswaran et al., 2019). Traces
    of both cultivated and wild sorghum were found from 3,500–1,500 B.C. in fired
    clay of Kassala region (Beldados and Costantini, 2011; Beldados et al., 2015).
    The most primitive domesticated sorghum was found 4,000 B.C. in Sudan (Winchell
    et al., 2017). The location of sorghum domestication is ambiguous (Venkateswaran
    et al., 2019). From its origin, i.e., Africa, domesticated sorghum begun dispersion
    via different means, like trade routes. Human migration brought sorghum from East
    to Southern Africa (Mann et al., 1983). Sorghum reached India through the trade
    routes of the Middle East (Mann et al., 1983). From India, it reached China through
    land and sea routes. However, the Indo-China river valley is regarded as an important
    route for this sorghum journey (Venkateswaran et al., 2019). In the 19th century,
    sorghum was introduced to the United States of America (USA) from China by traders,
    and it was then brought to Australia by Americans in the 1900s (Venkateswaran
    et al., 2014). figure 1 FIGURE 1. Sorghum classification (Wiersema and Dahlberg,
    2007; U.S. Department of Agriculture, 2020). Sorghum is cultivated across the
    globe in almost 110 countries, mainly in Africa and Asia but also in America,
    Europe and Oceania (Popescu et al., 2018). The plant up to 2 m high, is mostly
    grown in regions with low rainfall and high temperatures (Mundia et al., 2019).
    Sorghum can grow with few water supply, and is often considered as a drought-tolerant
    crop. Moreover, it can tolerate elevated temperatures in comparison to other cereals
    (Hall, 2000), typically temperatures in the range 24–27°C after germination (Mundia
    et al., 2019). It is mostly grown in areas receiving annual precipitation between
    350 and 700 mm. Sorghum needs very low fertilization and minimum pesticide treatment,
    and can be cultivated in marginal soils. Sorghum is genetically and taxonomically
    related to maize (Taylor, 2019). Both are diploid plants with 10 chromosomes (2n
    = 20) (Obilana, 2004). However, the genome of sorghum is relatively smaller than
    that of maize, with a value of ca. 730 (Paterson et al., 2009) and ca. 2,300 Mbp
    (Megabase pairs) (Schnable et al., 2009), respectively. According to the U.S.
    Department of Agriculture (2020), total global sorghum production was 62,641,000
    MT. Nigeria, Sudan, and Ethiopia were the leading countries in the world regarding
    sorghum production (Figure 2). United States of America (USA) (7085,000 MT), Argentina
    (2241,000 MT), Australia (1678,000 MT), Kenya (74,000 MT), and Ukraine (59,000
    MT) were the top five sorghum exporting countries (U.S. Department of Agriculture,
    2020). It has several names in various regions of the world, including Jowar (India),
    Dura (Sudan), Mtama (Eastern Africa), Kaoliang (China), milo (USA), and Kafir
    corn (South Africa) (Mohapatra et al., 2017). figure 2 FIGURE 2. Production statistics
    and percentage share of the world’s top 10 sorghum-producing countries (U.S. Department
    of Agriculture, 2020). Physiological response of sorghum to abiotic stresses Sorghum
    is a crop that is well-adapted to abiotic stresses including drought, salinity,
    heat, and cold stress (Behera et al., 2022). When sorghum is exposed to abiotic
    stress, it triggers a series of physiological responses to help the plant adapt
    to the stress and survive. Some of the common physiological responses of sorghum
    under abiotic stress are 1. Osmotic Adjustment: Sorghum plants under drought stress
    start to accumulate solutes such as amino acids, proline, and sugars in their
    cells, which help maintain cell turgor pressure, and thus, avoid wilting 2. Reduced
    transpiration rate: During drought stress, sorghum plants can reduce their transpiration
    rate by closing their stomata to conserve water. This is achieved through the
    production of abscisic acid (ABA), which triggers stomatal closure 3. Alteration
    of root architecture: Sorghum plants exposed to drought stress alter their root
    system to explore deeper soil layers where water is more abundant. This involves
    the elongation of the main root and an increase in lateral roots 4. Changes in
    photosynthesis: Sorghum plants reduce their photosynthetic activity when exposed
    to abiotic stress in order to conserve water. This can lead to a reduction in
    biomass production and yield 5. Increased antioxidant activity: Sorghum plants
    increase the production of antioxidant enzymes such as catalase, superoxide dismutase,
    and peroxidase to detoxify harmful reactive oxygen species (ROS) that accumulate
    under abiotic stress 6. Accumulation of compatible solutes: Sorghum plants can
    accumulate compatible solutes such as betaine, trehalose, and proline in response
    to salt stress. These solutes help maintain osmotic balance and protect cellular
    structures from damage. Drought stress Plant response to drought stress and drought
    tolerance is a result of complex biological processes involving physiological,
    biochemical, genomic, proteomic and metabolomics changes (Ngara et al., 2021).
    Stress-induced physiological changes, such as a shift in photosynthetic rate,
    were seen in genotypes of drought-sensitive sorghum (Fracasso et al., 2016). Photosynthetic
    rate, transpiration rate, water usage efficiency (WUE), and stomatal conductance
    are all significantly impacted by drought stress. An essential metric for assessing
    how drought stress affects photosynthesis is the Fv/Fm, which stands for maximum
    quantum yield of photosystem II (Husen et al., 2014). It serves as a measure of
    photosynthetic efficiency and is much lower in sorghum cultivated under drought
    stress circumstances (Johnson et al., 2014). According to Zhang et al. (2019),
    drought stress reduces stomatal conductance and transpiration rate, increases
    quantum yield and leaf temperature, decreases chlorophyll and Rubisco, increases
    O2 evolution, and decreases PEPCase activity in sorghum (Bao et al., 2016). Many
    studies have demonstrated that drought-tolerant sorghum genotypes have noticeably
    higher Fv/Fm and photosynthetic rate values (Fracasso et al., 2016; Sukumaran
    et al., 2016). The photosynthetic recovery that occurs after rehydration has a
    significant part in defining plants’ tolerance to drought as well as in preventing
    a decrease in grain yield, in addition to their capacity to avoid and/or tolerate
    drought stress (Chaves et al., 2009). Transpiration efficiency in drought-tolerant
    sorghum genotypes did not differ between control and drought stressed plants,
    but in drought sensitive genotypes, there was a statistically significant difference
    between control and drought stressed plants (Fracasso et al., 2016). In addition,
    during the drought stress period, genotypes that were more resistant to drought
    displayed a much higher WUE than those that were more susceptible to it (Fracasso
    et al., 2016). In sorghum, it has been found that grain yield is highly correlated
    with water extraction and transpiration efficiency (Vadez et al., 2011b). Drought
    resistant genotypes are those that preserve water that can be used during the
    grain filling stage in water-limited areas and have lower stomatal conductance
    and transpiration rates during the vegetative phase (Lopez et al., 2017). According
    to a study by Lopez et al. (2017), the QTL for stomatal conductance was linked
    to lower transpiration rates but not to shoot biomass or photosynthetic rates.
    A plant’s capacity to maintain a normal level of chlorophyll under drought stress
    factors into its capacity to respond to drought (Chen et al., 2016). The ability
    of the plant to absorb light for photosynthesis is directly influenced by the
    amount of total chlorophyll as well as chlorophyll a and b. Several investigations
    have found a considerable decrease in the amount of chlorophyll in sorghum cultivated
    under drought stress (Rama Reddy et al., 2014; Fracasso et al., 2016; Amoah and
    Antwi-Berko, 2020). When compared to equivalent genotypes grown under control
    conditions, the total chlorophyll content of stay-green genotypes underwent a
    23% decline while senescent genotypes underwent a 75% reduction (Xu et al., 2000).
    According to another study, stressed plants had 4.3% less total chlorophyll than
    control plants (Devnarain et al., 2016). Together with chlorophyll, lower concentrations
    of certain carotenoids have also been seen under extreme drought stress circumstances
    (Munné-Bosch et al., 2001). According to Takele (2010), drought-tolerant sorghum’s
    pre- and post-flowering stages have lower chlorophyll and carotenoid concentrations.
    The downregulation of genes involved in the terpenoid and carotenoid biosynthesis
    in drought sensitive genotypes is likely the cause of a drop in carotenoids (Fracasso
    et al., 2016). Drought stress causes downregulation of genes involved in the biosynthesis
    of carotenoids and chlorophyll, which has a significant impact on the pathways
    for light reaction and carbon fixation. The number of green leaves and the area
    of green leaves at the blooming and maturity stages were significantly positively
    correlated with the chlorophyll concentration at maturity. In turn, grain yield
    highly linked with both leaf characteristics at both stages (Rama Reddy et al.,
    2014). Loss of chlorophyll and a steady decline in photosynthetic capacity are
    the characteristics of leaf senescence (Borrell et al., 2000; Tao et al., 2000).
    Stay-green is a well-known feature that helps sorghum adapt to post-flowering
    dry conditions by delaying leaf senescence and enhancing grain output. Several
    researchers have worked to explain the physiological basis for sorghum’s ability
    to stay green. Early theories and research showed that stay green under drought
    stress conditions is linked to greater leaf nitrogen concentrations, cytokinin
    levels, and chlorophyll content. As an illustration, Borrell et al. (2000) discovered
    a link between stay green and greater leaf nitrogen concentrations, particularly
    during the flowering stage. A further study found that the stay-green sorghum
    genotypes maintain high amounts of cytokinin, which suggests a slower rate of
    senescence (Thomas and Howarth, 2000). Moreover, compared to senescent genotypes,
    the stay-green genotypes exhibit higher amounts of chlorophyll concentration (Xu
    et al., 2000). The stay green trait of sorghum as a response to drought is associated
    with higher leaf chlorophyll content, slower rate of loss of green leaf area (Kassahun
    et al., 2010), decreased tillering and size of upper leaves (Borrell et al., 2014a;
    Borrell et al., 2014b; George-Jaeggli et al., 2017). Moreover, the characteristic
    is associated with better water extraction and transpiration efficiency (TE) (Vadez
    et al., 2011a). The introgression of stay green QTLs from B35 to senescent variety
    R 16 under drought stress conditions resulted in higher leaf chlorophyll levels
    at flowering and a greater percentage of green leaf area during grain filling
    stages, which were correlated with a higher relative grain yield during the post-flowering
    stages (Kassahun et al., 2010). At blooming phases, the Stg QTL regulates canopy
    size by reducing tillering, increasing the size of top leaves, reducing the size
    of lower leaves, and in some situations, reducing the number of leaves per culm.
    The reduced canopy size at flowering decreases pre-flowering water demand, thereby
    leads to increased water availability during grain filling stage, which in turn
    lead to increased biomass production and grain yield (Borrell et al., 2014b).
    Old leaves are shed at the flowering stage as a result of lower leaves’ accelerated
    age-related senescence in stay-green lines, which results in a smaller canopy
    (George-Jaeggli et al., 2017). Any pre-flowering water savings boost post-flowering
    water availability, allowing plants to maintain their photosynthetic potential
    for a longer length of time and “remain green” throughout grain filling (George-Jaeggli
    et al., 2017). Remain green may be viewed as a post-flowering drought-tolerance
    mechanism that makes it easier to get the water needed for both general growth
    and grain production. Aluminium stress Plant production in acidic soils is greatly
    limited by the rhizotoxicity of Al3+. This problem is worsened by the use of ammonium
    fertilizers and acid rain. The concentration of Al3+ in the soil solution is higher
    at pH 3.7 compared to pH 5.8 or 6.3, as reported by Miller et al. (2009). The
    resistance mechanisms employed by plants against Al3+ toxicity can be categorized
    into two groups: external tolerance, involving the chelation of the metal ion
    by organic acids in the rhizosphere, and internal tolerance, involving the chelation
    of Al3+ within the cells (Inostroza-Blancheteau et al., 2008). Sorghum bicolor,
    a plant belonging to the first group, uses the exclusion mechanism to alleviate
    the toxicity of Al3+. This involves the release of organic acid exudates from
    root cells to the apoplast, which can bind and detoxify the harmful Al3+ cations
    outside the cell. Magalhaes et al. (2004) identified a major locus (Altsb) for
    Al3+ tolerance in two sorghum cultivars, which may be linked to citrate exudation
    from root apices. Furthermore, a gene encoding an aluminum-activated citrate transporter,
    a member of the multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) family, has been
    discovered in sorghum plants (Magalhaes et al., 2007). It is worth noting that
    genes controlling Al3+ resistance have been cloned from different crop plants,
    including sorghum (Ryan and Delhaize, 2010). Waterlogging In regions with tropical
    and sub-tropical climates, heavy rains, storms, excess irrigation or flooding
    may cause intermittent or long-term waterlogging of crops. This can be particularly
    detrimental to the crops as it not only affects their metabolism but also causes
    undesirable changes to the soil texture. A study by Promkhambu et al. (2010) compared
    the responses of three sweet sorghums and a forage cultivar after 20 days of waterlogging.
    The long-term flooding resulted in a significant reduction in biomass production,
    increased allocation of biomass to the roots, and a decrease in leaf area. In
    the sweet cultivars, it also significantly reduced photosynthetic rate, stomatal
    conductance, and transpiration. One sweet cultivar, Wray, showed high tolerance
    to waterlogging as evidenced by its ability to extend youngest leaves, produce
    new leaves, increase root length, and nodal root development. The adaptation of
    plants to O2 deficiency is based on their ability to maintain active fermentative
    metabolism under anaerobiosis. A flood-tolerant sorghum cv. SSG-59-3 exhibited
    a constant increase in alcohol dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.1) and lactate dehydrogenase
    (EC 1.1.1.27) activities, as well as higher ethanol concentration than the sensitive
    variety S-308. This suggests that the flood-tolerant variety tends to attain greater
    capacity for various fermentative pathways as alternative means to sustain production
    of ATP under flooded conditions (Jain et al., 2010). Salt stress Although sorghum
    is a salt-tolerant crop, there are genotypic variances among cultivars. High salinity
    is caused by an excess buildup of several ions in the soil, primarily sodium,
    calcium, magnesium, chloride, and sulphate, with sodium chloride being the most
    detrimental to plant growth and development. After 4 days of growth in 200 mM
    NaCl, a substantial salt-stress phenotype was found in sorghum plants (Kumar Swami
    et al., 2011). In sweet sorghum, salt stress decreased the percentage and lengthened
    the duration of germination (Gill et al., 2003; Almodares et al., 2007). Substantial
    variability in germination susceptibility to high salinity can be found among
    cultivars. Toxic ion accumulation (Na+ and Cl) disrupts ion uptake and K+ status
    of tissues; hence, high K+/Na + discrimination and the regulation of a low Na+/K+
    ratio in tissues characterize salt-tolerant genotypes (Hasegawa et al., 2000).
    The Na + content of tissues in sorghum rose with additional external sodium concentrations
    (de Lacerda et al., 2003), whereas root and shoot Na + contents differed significantly
    between genotypes (Bavei et al., 2011a). Reduced sodium buildup in the shoot is
    the result of either decreased Na + uptake by the root or variations in the rate
    of Na + transport to the shoot. Jambo, a salt-tolerant sorghum variety was reported
    to accumulate less Na+ in root and shoot tissues than salt-sensitive genotypes
    and maintain lower Na+/K+ ratios in both root and shoot tissues (Bavei et al.,
    2011a). The salt-tolerant genotype Jambo was also shown to accumulate more Ca2+
    in both leaf and root tissues than the sensitive types, Kimia and Payam (Bavei
    et al., 2011b). Several studies have linked salt tolerance to an increase in antioxidant
    enzyme activity. However, greater antioxidant activities did not consistently
    depend on salt tolerance, and precise tuning of both enzymatic and non-enzymatic
    ROS-scavenging constituents can contribute to successful acclimatization. Silicon
    application to soil mitigated salinity stress in two sorghum cultivars and resulted
    in an increase in the activities of ascorbate peroxidase, catalase, superoxide
    dismutase, peroxidase, glutathione reductase and total phenol and antioxidant
    contents of tissues, indicating that the mitigation of salinity stress was associated
    with increased antioxidant activity. In addition, after silicon treatment, the
    plants accumulated compatible osmolytes, soluble carbohydrates, and proline and
    displayed greater osmotic adaptability (Kafi et al., 2011). Stem yield and soluble
    carbohydrate levels declined with increasing salt in two sweet sorghums (cvs Keller
    and Sofra) and one grain sorghum cultivar (Kimia), however at the highest salinity
    level, cv. Keller had the greatest stem yield and sucrose content (Almodares et
    al., 2008). Although various authors have published analyses of transcriptomes
    in response to abiotic stressors (Dugas et al., 2011), investigations on the cellular
    proteome in sorghum are scarce. Swami et al. (2011) examined at how the protein
    complement of sorghum leaves changed after 96 h of exposure to 200 mM NaCl. They
    demonstrated 21 areas with changed expressions on 2-DE gels and identified them
    using a MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometer after tryptic digestion of the excised
    spots. One protein, ATP synthase a-subunit, showed increased abundance, indicating
    that salt stress had an effect on the photosynthetic machinery. Eight of the upregulated
    proteins were engaged in scavenging reactive oxygen species (POX and APX) or detoxifying
    reactive electrophilic chemicals (glutathione S-transferase, EC 2.5.1.18). Additional
    proteins that may be involved in Na + -induced signal transduction include lectin-like
    protein kinase, salt-inducible protein kinase, and serine/threonine protein kinase.
    High and low temperature stresses The total sugar content and biomass output of
    sweet sorghum are determined by the planting date: the later the planting, the
    lower the stalk yields in arid conditions (Almodares and Mostafafi Darany, 2006).
    In hot and dry climate zones, the key criteria determining planting date are soil
    water scarcity and cultivar heat stress sensitivity (Teetor et al., 2011). During
    a delayed harvest period, a reduction in carbohydrate components in the stems
    of Chinese sweet sorghum cultivars were reported (Zhao et al., 2012). Chilling
    stress in early spring can limit optimal development in temperate zones, determining
    the planting date in these regions. Sweet sorghum is a cold-sensitive crop, and
    low temperatures affect seed germination, seedling emergence, and plant growth.
    Burow et al. (2011) established simple sequence repeat (SSR) molecular markers
    related with several features for early-season cold tolerance in order to generate
    elite sorghum lines with stable and good early-season cold resistance. The mapping
    population is comprised of 171 F7-F8 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) generated
    from the cross of cold-sensitive RTX430 and cold-tolerant PI610727 lines. Gaigao
    Liang is another name for PI610727, a landrace from Chinese germplasm selected
    for early-season cold resistance. The RILs were tested in the laboratory for cold
    and ideal temperature germinability, field emergence, and seedling vigour in two
    locations during early-season planting. All traits had two or more quantitative
    trait loci (QTLs), except seedling vigour, which had only one QTL. The authors
    labeled the genomic areas of sorghum that have significant contributions to traits
    for early-season cold tolerance using PI610727, a new source of cold tolerance.
    Extreme temperature stress may also lead to a decrease in biomass and sugar output.
    Heat stress has a substantial impact on photosynthetic activity, light reactions,
    and the activity of Calvin cycle enzymes (Yan et al., 2011). It has been revealed
    that photosynthetic activity is affected not only by daytime temperatures but
    also by nighttime temperatures (Prasad and Djanaguiraman, 2011). The authors examined
    the effect of an optimal day/night temperature combination (32/22 °C, respectively)
    to that of an optimal day temperature (32 °C)/high night temperature (HNT) (28
    °C) combination and observed that HNT negatively impacted the photosynthetic activity
    of plants. Exposure to HNT enhanced thylakoid membrane damage and non-photochemical
    quenching, but lowered chlorophyll content of tissues, photochemical quenching
    parameter, electron transport rate, and photosynthetic activity of leaves. In
    addition, HNT boosted the generation of ROS in leaves and pollen grains and led
    to decreased pollen germination and lower seed set. Prasad et al. (2011) also
    found that grain sorghum pollen had shorter lifespan and showed much lower germination
    percentage on artificial growth medium at higher temperatures. Moreover, when
    compared to control plants grown at ideal temperatures (32/22°C), high temperature
    stress (40/30°C day/night temperatures) decreased chlorophyll content, photosynthetic
    rate, and antioxidant enzyme activities while increasing oxidant generation and
    membrane damage. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are proteins that are produced in
    reaction to high temperatures or other abiotic stresses, and as molecular chaperones,
    they can protect proteins from the stressors’ damaging effects. The expression
    of hsp90 was compared in different types of sorghum (grain and forage sorghum
    hybrids, as well as in sweet sorghum cultivar) following varied heat stress durations
    (Pavli et al., 2011). The accumulation of hsp90 transcripts was measured by RT-qPCR
    analysis, and the levels of gene expression were shown to be significantly different
    in the genotypes studied. Sorghum’s whole genome sequence has been published.
    In combination with the investigation of abiotic stress-induced transcriptomes,
    proteomes, and metabolomes, this gives a valuable tool for breeders looking to
    improve the stress tolerance of this vital energy crop. Genetic resources of sorghum
    The two most important sorghum germplasm banks are the International Crops Research
    Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT, India) and the United States Department
    of Agriculture’s National Plant Germplasm System (USDA-NPGS). Each house upwards
    of 41,000 sorghum accessions, along with historical accessions, landraces, wild
    relatives, and breeding lines. The National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources
    in India has about 20,000 collections. The greatest collection of Australian wild
    sorghums is held by the Australian Tropical Crops and Forages Genetic Resources
    Center. While in China, the Institute of Crop Germplasm Resources is holding over
    16,874 collections. Sorghum was domesticated and evolved in North-east Africa,
    a unique that extend from Sudan to Ethiopia (Wendorf et al., 1992). As a result,
    the oldest wild types and greatest diversity can be found in Ethiopia and Sudan.
    The largest collection of accessions (almost 41,000) kept at the USDA-NPGS having
    7, 217 accessions from Ethiopia, and 2,552 were from Sudan as reported by Dahlberg
    et al. (2004). Although these two regions are the principal source of sorghum
    origin, their germplasm resources differ substantially. Five ancestral populations
    make up a representative Sudan core collection as opposed to eleven ancestral
    populations in the Ethiopia core set. Additionally, the pairwise genetic distance
    between the accessions in the Sudan core set is greater than it is in Ethiopia,
    indicating that Sudan collection has a greater genetic variability (Cuevas and
    Prom, 2020). Major gene bank collections are enlisted in Table 1. table 1 TABLE
    1. Sorghum germplasm conserved in major gene banks. Sorghum genomic resources
    Structural genomics: molecular markers (from hybridization based to sequenced
    based) in sorghum The Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) marker system
    has been initially widely used in sorghum (Tao et al., 1998). Thereafter, more
    marker systems emerged for sorghum, including Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism
    (AFLP), Randomly Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD), Single Sequence Repeats (SSRs),
    and Diversity Array Technology (DArT) markers (Haussmann et al., 2002; Bowers
    et al., 2003; Wu et al., 2006; Mace et al., 2008). Each of these marker systems
    was utilized in sorghum for various objectives, including QTL mapping, genetic
    diversity analysis, and fingerprinting. The genome sequence accessibility of sorghum
    offers a chance to widen the embankment of SSRs molecular markers. This genome
    sequence predicts around 71,000 SSRs. The sorghum complete genome sequence and
    Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) approaches like genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS)
    made it possible to speed up the production of valuable and cheap maker systems.
    Publication of initial reference genome accessions for sorghum (Paterson et al.,
    2009), together with advances in NGS tools and speedy progress in Computational
    Tools (CTs), have created innovative opportunities for the swift and genomic DNA
    markers applicable for high-throughput genotyping (HTG) in sorghum. The recent
    improvements in sequencing and complete-genome genotyping tools, including NGS
    and Whole-genome marker arrays (WGMA), allowed the assembly of extensive genomic
    resources conservation in sorghum (Morris et al., 2013a; McCormick et al., 2018).
    The NGS technique, including Whole genome shotgun technique (WGST) and Illumina
    Genome Analyzer sequencing technology (IGAST), together with more swift placement
    software, utilized to re-sequence accessory sorghum lines to explore a wide number
    of structural variants and SNPs in formerly sequenced genomes of sorghum (Nelson
    et al., 2011; Morris et al., 2013b; Bekele et al., 2013). SNPs, copy number variations,
    in-dels (insertions-deletions), duplications, translocations, inversions, and
    absence/presence variants are all types of structural changes that can happen
    in a genome (Saxena et al., 2014). GBS is a commonly utilized genotyping technique
    in GWAS that combines multiplex to detect high-density SNPs with reduction enzymes
    for minimizing genome convolution (Elshire et al., 2011). Worthwhile quantity
    of sorghum accessions has been sequenced using the GBS tool to evaluate the genetic
    diversity (GD) and structure (Morris et al., 2013a). Determining the GD in sorghum
    germplasm collections facilitates the detection of narrative alleles and genes
    linked with crucial characters and also used to improve the germplasm in breeding
    programs. Multiple genomic resources are available for the sorghum research community,
    comprising DNA markers like SSR, DArT, SNPs (Billot et al., 2012; Evans et al.,
    2013), the high-density genetic maps (Kong et al., 2013), and sequenced genomes
    (Mace et al., 2013). Sorghum’s genome has been thoroughly assembled and annotated,
    making it possible to use RAD-seq (Restriction site-associated DNA tags sequencing),
    which are dispersed widely across the genome. High-resolution genotyping (HRG)
    and SNP identification is dependent on a decrease in genomic complexity. Nelson
    et al. (2011) identified 283,000 numbers of SNPs from 8 accessions of sorghum
    using a RAD-seq sequencing approach. Changes in the structure of genomes are a
    key part of biological and evolutionary processes, and research must be done to
    find a link between genetic differences and how well plants do. Progress towards
    the development of trait-specific recombinant inbred line mapping populations
    Several minor genes govern quantitative features of agronomic concern, which are
    heavily impacted by the environment. Therefore, in order to determine genes and
    QTLs that interact with their surroundings, genetic examination of these traits
    needs growth to occur over a period of time that comprise numerous years and venues
    (Kumar et al., 2018). In parallel with the focus that has been placed on the development
    of the mapping populations, significant real progress has been made around the
    world in the quest to create trait-specific RILs (recombinant inbred line) for
    key traits in sorghum, such as earliness, drought resilience, root traits, early
    growth vigor, biotic resistance and Zn and Fe content (Tuinstra et al., 1996;
    Kotla et al., 2019). The 342 RIL (F6) populations were developed from cross 296B
    x PVK 801 to check Fe and Zn concentrations and to create linkage maps and QTLs
    detection for Zn and Fe (Kotla et al., 2019). Drought is one of the most deleterious
    factors affecting agricultural productivity in tropical regions, along with other
    abiotic factors. “Terminal drought” is used to describe drought that occurs during
    the grain-filling stage. “Stay green” is one of the features that is considered
    to be responsible for a plant’s ability to withstand extreme drought. Researchers
    from a variety of institutions have discovered QTLs that are responsible for resilience
    to the terminal drought (Haussmann et al., 2002; Harris et al., 2007), whereas
    Crasta et al. (1999) identified 2 QTLs for maturity and 7 QTLs for terminal drought
    tolerance (Table 2). Within these 7 QTLs, 3 were contributed around 42% of the
    phenotypic variability, while 4 minor QTLs accounted a combined 25% of the phenotypic
    diversity in terms of stay green assessments. Only 4 significant QTLs were reported
    in sorghum to be responsible for the stay green characteristic (Sanchez et al.,
    2002; Harris et al. (2007). B35 genotype was used as donor parent in both of the
    tests that were conducted. The E36-1 genotype served as the parent material in
    a further investigation that aimed to determine the QTLs that control the stay
    green traits in sorghum (Haussmann et al., 2002). By producing 245 F9 RILs resulting
    from a hybrid between M35-1 and B35, Nagaraja Reddy et al. (2013) were able to
    identify 61 QTL for a variety of different markers of stay green characteristics.
    Their expression featured a significant amount of Stg2, Stg3, and StgB. table
    2 TABLE 2. Summary of numbers of stay green QTLs identified by developing RILs.
    Development of sequenced based high-density map Early sorghum genetic maps Mapping
    studies in sorghum-containing DNA markers were initiated at the beginning of the
    1990s (Table 3). DNA fragments characterized in maize were found to hybridize
    strongly with sorghum DNA and many other additional crops, comprising Johnson
    grass, sugarcane, and foxtail millet signifying that polymorphic loci both in
    sorghum and maize are specific (Hulbert et al., 1990). Moreover, RFLPs probes
    derived from maize were utilized in sorghum to construct linkage map and it was
    discovered that the maize probes were similar to the sorghum probes (Whitkus et
    al., 1992; Berhan et al., 1993). This made it possible to investigate comparative
    genetics among species that are genetically linked to one another and opened the
    door for the possibility of evaluating horizontal transfer of genes from other
    species to sorghum simultaneously. In order to determine the synteny and homology
    shared by the various members of the Poaceae family, the earlier maps that contained
    both endogenous and exogenous RFLP probes proved to be very useful in comparative
    genomic research. In addition, probes obtained from cDNA and genomic DNA (gDNA)
    particular sorghum were incorporated into linkage maps alongside exogenous probes
    that were established from other related genomes. Ragab et al. (1994) created
    a map that consisted of 33 maize probes and 38 sorghum probes. The length of the
    map was 633 cM, and the average distance between markers was 8.9 cm. Subudhi and
    Nguyen (2000) integrated the maps of a RIL population to align five primary RFLP
    maps with 10 linkage groups. This was done by aligning the maps using linkage
    groups. This assisted us in determining how QTL markers located in various sections
    of the genome are connected to one another and how accurate the maps that we currently
    possess are. table 3 TABLE 3. Sorghum genetic linkage maps. High-density genetic
    maps with various types of markers In sorghum, high-density genetic maps can be
    utilized for useful gene mining, genome comparison, and gene mapping. In addition,
    they improve the statistical power and accuracy of recognizing QTLs and genes
    (Ji et al., 2017). In contrast to other molecular markers, RAPD and RFLP molecular
    markers have been of narrow use in the constructing of sorghum genetic mapping.
    RAPD markers have a dominant pattern of heritage and inadequate repeatability.
    As a result, their application in sorghum genetic analysis is confined. Due to
    the accuracy of the AFLP method for genetic mapping in sorghum, it was frequently
    used in the saturation of linkage maps established previously with RAPD and RFLP
    markers. AFLP markers have been included on sorghum linkage maps so that map early
    sensory and QTL identifications can be performed (Shiringani and Friedt, 2011).
    Despite this, AFLPs is not widely used because of the complexity involved in map-based
    cloning application with highly marker-assisted breeding tools. Additionally,
    this technique requires a substantial amount of time to obtain results and is
    costly too. So, it was important to come up with quick and cheap ways to figure
    out a plant’s genotype. For plant genotyping, SSRs markers with a dense level
    of polymorphism have become severely popular than AFLP and RAPD due to their ease
    of use, low cost, automation and throughput level (Varshney et al., 2005). Such
    markers have greatly provide the molecular inspection of agriculturally essential
    characters in various crops such as sorghum (Murray et al., 2008; Kumar et al.,
    2015). Bhattramakki et al. (2000) described a mixed RFLP and SSR linkage map of
    sorghum employing a significant number of RFLP and SSR loci of sorghum. This map
    was used to determine the genetic linkage of sorghum. The application of RAPD,
    RFLP, SSR and AFLP markers has been pervaded by less reproducibility and genome
    coverage. DArT markers have the capability of whole-genome profiling and high-throughput
    based hybridization technology. Sabadin et al. (2012) used a BR007 x SC283 cross
    to create a genetic map of sorghum that included 255 DArT markers, 1 RFLP, 83
    SSRs, and 5 sequence-tagged sites (STS). These genetic maps have the potential
    to serve as sources for a variety of genetic research projects as well as well
    as the incorporation of DArT markers with other genetic resources. As of right
    now, the SNPs exposed by NGS are the most desirable option of markers for use
    in plant breeding and plant genetic research. This is due to the fact that they
    are present in such high numbers in nearly every population. Access to huge collections
    of SNPs continues to make it possible for genetic techniques such as population
    structure, association research, linkage mapping, map-based cloning, functional
    genomics and marker-assisted breeding (Kumar et al., 2012). It was proved that
    resequencing is effective in sorghum by developing an ultra-high-density linkage
    map employing 244 RILs of sorghum crosses and high-quality SNPs derived from low-coverage
    genomes. This map was used to demonstrate the usefulness of resequencing (Zou
    et al., 2012). With the improvement in sequencing technology, SNPs from genome
    sequencing have been frequently used for QTL analysis and genetic mapping (Berkman
    et al., 2012). Restriction Site Associated DNA Sequencing (RAD-seq) is a technique
    of reduced-representation genome sequencing. This technology has a high throughput
    at an affordable cost and is easy to use (Kim et al., 2016). The RAD-seq technique
    has been extensively employed in genetic mapping. This technique was used to build
    an important genetic map from a RIL population between Sudangrass and sorghum
    Tx623A. This map has a complete length of 1191.7 cm and comprises 1,065 markers
    (Jin et al., 2021). Reference genome of sorghum Sorghum, being a diploid crop,
    has a relatively small and non-duplicated genome. The whole reference genome sequence
    of BTx623 was first assembled by Sanger sequencing (Paterson et al., 2009) and
    has been updated thereafter by McCormick et al. (2018). It is characterized by
    58.8% retrotransposons, 8.7% DNA transposons, and ∼34,129 annotated genes. On
    its genomic basis, numerous sequence variations have been found, including large
    genomic copy number variation (CNV), insertions and deletions (InDels), and the
    presence and absence (PAV) of BTx623 (Zheng et al., 2011; Mace et al., 2013).
    There is now a number of sorghum SNP databases and microarray datasets accessible
    (Shakoor et al., 2014; Luo et al., 2016; Hua et al., 2019). Other sorghum genome
    sequences are also reported as a result of the advancement of sequencing technologies.
    Bionano Genomics Direct Label and Stain (DLS) optical mapping and Oxford Nanopore
    sequencing technology have been used to create a chromosome-scale de novo assembly
    of the genome of a grain sorghum line Tx430 (Deschamps et al., 2018). Tx430 varies
    from BTx623 in that it has a shorter median length and more predicted genes—39,510
    in total. The sweet sorghum Rio genome was subsequently constructed to better
    understand its sugar metabolism. Rio’s final genome was 729.4 Mb in size, with
    35,476 predicted genes, 54 of which were specific to Rio. In order to understand
    the metabolism of sugar, the genome of Rio’s sweet sorghum was subsequently assembled
    at the chromosomal level. Each of these genome assemblies is limited to its respective
    accession and does not reflect the diversity of genes in this species. However,
    the diversity within a species cannot be captured by a single reference genome
    for all species and therefore requires a “pan-genome” to truly represent diversity
    within an organism (Bayer et al., 2020). A pan-genome of sorghum was constructed
    using an ongoing mapping and assembly method. Of the 354 entire genomes that were
    sequenced, 176 of the accessions had a coverage greater than 10X. In comparison
    to the reference assembly’s 708 Mbp size, the pan-overall genome’s size has grown
    by 20% (175 Mbp), to 883 Mbp (Ruperao et al., 2021). The great amount of genetic
    variety shown in the various species is likely to blame for this level of new
    sequence growth (Cuevas and Prom, 2020). The newly constructed pan-genome includes
    an average of 32,795 genes across all cultivars, with a core genome of 16,821
    genes. More reference genomes are needed to fully understand the genetic basis
    of phenotypic diversity that emerged throughout sorghum domestication and development.
    The statistics of the reference genome of sorghum are presented in Table 4. table
    4 TABLE 4. Sorghum bicolor reference genome statistics. An appreciation genome
    sequence was produced and annotated in the research carried out by McCormick et
    al. (2018). This was accomplished by employing transcriptome data, deep sequencing,
    and genetic linkage analysis. The reference genome sequence order has been increased,
    an additional 29.6 Mbp of sequence has been incorporated, the quantity of genes
    that have been annotated has increased by 24%–34,211, the median gene length and
    N50 have both increased, and the inaccuracy frequency has decreased by a factor
    of ten to 1 per 100 kbp. Functional genomics toward the identification of candidate
    genes Marker assisted breeding in sorghum The selection of parents for crossover
    can be made using genomics-assisted breeding, as can the validation of the genetic
    purity of F1 offspring, the mapping of features for introgression, and the molecular
    profile of breeding populations for the purpose of selecting enhanced types. Molecular
    markers have seen widespread usage in the study of cultivated and raced sorghum
    in order to ascertain the level of genetic variation present in the crop (Deu
    et al., 1994; Oliviera et al., 1996; Menkir et al., 1997). Sorghum hybrids and
    cultivars have been developed during the past few decades using traditional breeding
    techniques. They have increased grain yield and greater flexibility. In order
    to long-term advance of sorghum to fulfill the needs of the future, continual
    progress in the gene engineering of important adaptive and productive characteristics
    is required. The yield and efficiency of sorghum have just reached a plateau,
    and the efforts that have been put into breeding are becoming less fruitful. Potential
    productivity can be reduced by factors like vulnerability to water shortage, pests
    and diseases, and weeds, particularly striga. Traditional breeding to improve
    these complicated features has not yielded adequate results, owing to the intricate
    genetic control of these traits as well as significant environmental influence.
    However, if the selection is based on DNA markers, rapid genetic increases can
    be accomplished (Bernardo, 2014). DNA markers are thus becoming increasingly important
    for the genetic improvement of sorghum. Multiple marker systems have been developed
    and applied to tag and map significant influence genes and quantitative characteristics
    (QTL) of economic importance, i.e., grain yield and its components, insect pest
    and disease resistance, Striga, salinity, drought, nutritional quality and cold,
    among others. Some important steps involved in marker assisted selection (MAS)
    are described in Figure 3. figure 3 FIGURE 3. Important stages of marker-assisted
    selection (MAS). Biotic stress in sorghum The sorghum crop is threatened by numerous
    biotic factors, including infectious pathogens/diseases, parasitic weeds and insect
    pests. Annually, biotic diseases, alone or in combination with other factors,
    cause a substantial economic loss in sorghum (Mengistu et al., 2019). Presently,
    one hundred and fifty insect species have been recorded in sorghum crops, among
    which the most destructive are aphid species (Rhopalosiphum maidis and Melanaphis
    sacchari), Atherigona soccata (Shoot-fly), and Stenodiplosis sorghicola (Sorghum
    midge) (Kumari et al., 2021). Weed infestation in sorghum significantly reduces
    its yield. The wild Striga is the common weed restrain sorghum yield in all continents,
    especially in Africa. In heavily infested soils, Striga spp. can reduce crop yields
    by up to 100% (Kavuluko et al., 2021). The use of modern genetically modified
    methods to recognize and transfer candidate genes to improve productivity and
    resistance to biotic stress has the potential to boost overall sorghum performance
    (Hariprasanna and Rakshit, 2016). It is important to identify and use new genes
    for host plant resistance in order to develop biotic stress-resistant cultivars.
    Marker-assisted breeding in sorghum for biotic stresses Sorghum, like other cereal
    crops, is susceptible to biotic stresses such as bacterial, fungal, nematode,
    and virus infections. The most common diseases are fungal infections caused by
    smut, charcoal rot, ergot, downy mildew, blast, and rust, which have a greater
    impact on sorghum plant health and productivity (Fakrudin et al., 2021). Other
    common fungal diseases that affect sorghum fodder and grain production include
    blast (Pyricularia oryzae) and rust (Puccinia purpurea). Rust has caused significant
    yield reductions of 50%, 30%, and 13.1% in India, the Philippines, and Australia,
    respectively (White et al., 2012). To develop resistance in sorghum against the
    phyllosphere fungal diseases, Sharma et al. (2012) tested 242 sorghum accessions
    in both in vitro and in vivo conditions. The findings of this study reveal that
    six out of 242 accessions (IS 33023 (Tanzania), IS 23521 (Ethiopia), IS 473(US),
    IS 23684 (Mozambique), IS 24503, and IS 26737 (South Africa) showed resistance
    against sorghum foliar fungal diseases. Four bacterial diseases, i.e., leaf spot
    (Pseudomonas syringae), leaf streak (Xanthomonas campestris pv. Holcicola), leaf
    strips (Burkholderia andropogonis) and red stripe (Herbaspirillum rubrisubalbicans)
    considerably affect the sorghum plant (Kutama et al., 2010; Tuleski et al., 2020).
    The rain, wind, and humid wet conditions are favorable for the dispersal of bacterial
    infection from a single plant to a pandemic. Plant parasitic nematodes (PPN) are
    also posing a negative impact on sorghum crop production (Traore et al., 2012).
    Sorghum crops are affected by a wide range of PPN, including Xiphinema americanum
    (Dagger), Meloidogyne spp. (Root knot), Paratrichodorus minor (Stubby root), Tylenchorhynchus
    spp. (Stunt), Longidorus africanus (Needle) and Belonolaimus longicaudatus (Sting).
    The infected sorghum plant becomes stunted at the initial stage of root infection
    and delays blooming, consequently destroying the overall harvesting yield (Little
    et al., 2018). Like other infectious diseases, viral diseases also have a deleterious
    effect on sorghum plant health and yield. Several viruses affect sorghum globally,
    causing several symptoms (Oksal et al., 2021). There are 23 viruses that have
    been identified worldwide as pathogenic to sorghum plants, with nine (09) of them
    being found in Asian countries. These sorghum viruses are divided into three sections,
    Potyvirus: Johnson grass mosaic virus, sugarcane mosaic virus, sorghum mosaic
    virus, and maize dwarf mosaic virus; Rhabdovirus: maize mosaic virus and Tenuivirus:
    Maize Stripe Virus which negatively affect the sorghum crop in different regions
    of the world (Srinivas et al., 2010). Sorghum shows the symptoms of delayed flowering,
    mosaic, chlorotic streaks, mottling, reddening of leaves, yellowing, dwarfing,
    necrotic spots, and sterility in response to viral diseases (Li et al., 2013;
    Achon et al., 2017). Unfortunately, up to now, none of the sorghum lines are showing
    genetic resistance against the reported viruses. To improve the resistance of
    sorghum against viral diseases, there is a dire need to modify the genome of the
    host plant and detect the QTLs by using GWAS and other molecular markers (Mengistu
    et al., 2021; Nida et al., 2021). To combat plant disease, an integration of disease
    management strategies, such as chemical methods and cultural methods, can be beneficial.
    Sorghum’s tolerance to biotic stresses has been improved with the help of genomic
    techniques, including large scale genotyping and high-throughput sequencing. The
    use of marker-assisted breeding and transgenics will support more effectively
    addressing the problem of diseases (Madhusudhana, 2019). A number of resistant
    genes in sorghum plants against all the above-mentioned diseases have been identified
    previously by using different molecular markers (Table 5). table 5 TABLE 5. QTL
    identification for resistance to plant diseases. Insect pest The quick resistance
    and mutation in the genomes of various insect species against synthetic insecticides
    have become a major challenge to gaining maximum yield. The sorghum plant is a
    host to 150 insect species that are suppressing the plant’s efficacy and playing
    a role in yield loss (Guo et al., 2011). The lepidopterous Chilo partellus (stem
    borer), dipterans Stenodiplosis sorghicola (midges), Atherigona soccata (shoot
    flies), and hemipteran Schizaphis graminum (Greenbug) are the most damaging pests
    of sorghum (Okosun et al., 2021). Tao et al. (2003) explained two genetic mechanisms
    (antixenosis and antibiosis) of resistance in the cross sorghum line ICSV745 ×
    90,562 against the midge. Identification and characterization of genetic loci
    through marker-assisted breeding and map-based cloning involved in S. graminum
    resistance. The 36 QTLs involved in resistance to S. graminum have been registered
    in many studies (Table 6) (Wu and Huang, 2008; Punnuri et al., 2013). Shoot fly
    (Atherigona soccata) is also considered a major damaging pest of sorghum. The
    larvae of A. soccata cut the new emerging points of the shoot and caused symptoms
    like a dead heart. Polymorphisms in sorghum’s resistance to shot flies have been
    found, and these polymorphisms have been exploited to locate genetic loci that
    affect sorghum’s resistance to shoot flies. A large number of molecular traits
    and resistance loci are identified in various sorghum genotypes and cultivars
    using the molecular SSRs, SNPs, and GWAS approaches, including SFCR 151, IS 1057,
    PS 30715–1, IS 1071, IS 1082, IS 4663, IS 1096, IS 2312, IS 2146, IS 18369, IS
    2205, IS 18551, and IS 2394 against A. soccata. Up to this point, only a select
    few resistant germplasms have been utilized in A. soccata resistance breeding
    initiatives (Chamarthi et al., 2011; Kumari et al., 2021). table 6 TABLE 6. Details
    on insect pest resistance loci discovered in sorghum. Parasitic weeds Parasitic
    weeds are a major cause of sorghum yield reduction around the world (Bellis et
    al., 2020). The losses due to this biotic factor have been recorded at up to 60%
    (Dille et al., 2020). Different weeds like crabgrass (Digitaria sanguinalis),
    common lamb squarters (Chenopodium album), palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri),
    johnsongrass (Sorghum halepense), common waterhemp (Amaranthus tuberculatus),
    shattercane (Sorghum bicolor ssp. verticilliflorum), kochia (Bassia scoparia),
    and Striga (S. hermonthica) have been recorded in various regions of the world
    (Peerzada et al., 2017). Striga sp. is the most dangerous weed for the sorghum
    crop. The losses due to Striga weeds alone in Africa were recorded at 30%–100%
    (Mrema et al., 2016). Teka (2014) conducted a research trial for the screening
    of different sorghum germplasms for Striga resistance and concluded that the germplasms
    Framida, N13, Seguetana CZ, SRN39, PSL5061, ICSVs, P9401, SRN39, 555, PSL5061,
    CMDT45, P9403, P9403, P9401, and Soumalemba are resistant to Striga. There is
    a need to find and develop genomic-based resistance in sorghum against Striga.
    QTL mapping is a vital source for finding resistance genes in sorghum against
    these parasitic weeds. Haussmann et al. (2004) used SSR markers combined with
    MAS and revealed 6 resistance QTL genes in sorghum against the Striga from Chromosome
    A, Chromosome J1, Chromosome B, Chromosome I, and Chromosome J2. Resistant QTL
    and MAS-based studies have the efficacy to aid in the development of resistant
    cultivars. A key prerequisite for breeding programs is knowledge of Striga resistance
    in host plants and the genetic basis for this resistance. According to hypothesis,
    Striga resistance in sorghum is due to a combination of factors such as incompatibility,
    hypersensitive reactions, low haustoria initiation activity, and low germination
    stimulant activity. Cowpea was the first plant for which the Striga-resistant
    gene was discovered. This discovery was made by Li et al. (2009). To date, several
    QTLs have been identified in sorghum for Striga resistance (Table 7). table 7
    TABLE 7. QTLs identified in sorghum for Striga resistance. Abiotic stress tolerance
    Tolerance to abiotic stress is intricate and often controlled by a large number
    of quantitative trait loci (Mwamahonje et al., 2021; Osman et al., 2022). The
    generation of superior lines with enhanced resilience to abiotic stress using
    molecular breeding procedures has a limited track record of success (Tonapi et
    al., 2020). Due to its significance, several QTL mapping work for stay green in
    sorghum have been documented (Table 8) (Kiranmayee et al., 2015; Aquib and Nafis,
    2022). So far, 7 stay green trait source have been exploited to identify QTLs
    for this phenotype. These included QL41 (Tao et al., 2000), SC283 (Sabadin et
    al., 2012), B35 (Harris et al., 2007), SDS 1948-3 (Habyarimana et al., 2010),
    E36-1 (Haussmann et al., 2002), 296B (Srinivas et al., 2009a), and SC56 (Kebede
    et al., 2001). The most prevalent of these sources is B35 (Rosenow et al., 1983).
    Stay green was found to be quantitatively inherited in all studies, however the
    QTLs diverse across years and environments. Moreover, 6 main stg QTLs (i.e., stg
    C, stg 3A and stg 3B, stg 1 and stg 2, and stg4) on SBI-01, SBI-02, SBI-03, and
    SBI-05, respectively, have been uncovered via various examinations (Tao et al.,
    2000; Xu et al., 2000; Haussmann et al., 2002; Sanchez et al., 2002; Harris et
    al., 2007). The molecular studies recognized four major stay green QTLs designated
    as Stg1, Stg2, Stg3, and Stg4, as well as several minor QTLs (Sabadin et al.,
    2012). Stg1 and Stg2 were mapped to sorghum chromosome 3, explaining approximately
    20%–30% of the phenotypic variance (Sanchez et al., 2002; Harris et al., 2007).
    The Stg3 gene is found on chromosome 2, and the Stg4 gene is found on chromosome
    5. Stg3 and Stg4 are responsible for 16% and 10% of the morphological traits,
    separately (Sanchez et al., 2002; Harris et al., 2007). table 8 TABLE 8. QTLs
    identified for abiotic stress tolerance in sorghum. Sorghum production in tropical
    and subtropical climates faces a substantial constraint due to Al toxicity (Gao
    et al., 2021), which is the primary factor impacting crop production on two-thirds
    of the acid soil affected area (Guimaraes and de Magalhaes, 2021; Rahman and Upadhyaya,
    2021). When the Al-sensitive BR007 is crossed with the Al-tolerant SC283, only
    one gene (i.e., SbMATE/AltSB) controls Al tolerance in sorghum. This gene is located
    on chromosome 3 (Magalhaes et al., 2004). Concerning temperature, generally sorghum
    cannot grow well when the temperature is less than 15°C. Early planting may be
    possible, particularly in the United States, if sorghum cultivars can be induced
    with early-season cold tolerance. This will allow the range in which sorghum may
    be grown to be enlarged to include more northern latitudes (Yu and Tuinstra, 2001).
    Bekele et al. (2013) found a highly interacting epistatic QTL hotspot that had
    a significant effect on longer chilling survival. They discovered numerous genes
    that confer cell division and growth maintenance in response to early freezing
    stress within QTL hotspot regions, which might be potential candidates to breed
    cold resistance. According to the findings of Balota et al. (2010), a higher respiration
    rate in sorghum is associated with better germination despite the presence of
    cold stress. Washburn et al. (2013) associated a rhizome development trait with
    sorghum’s ability of overwintering. Overwintering and rhizomatousness phenomena
    are governed by 7 QTLs as reported by Paterson et al. (1995) and Washburn et al.
    (2013) which were recognized in a mapping population of BTx623/S. propinquum.
    Anami et al. (2015) revealed that sorghum’s potential to overwinter and develop
    rhizomes are advantageous for biofuel production. Salinity is also a growing issue
    in sorghum cultivated areas in several parts of the world (Mansour et al., 2021;
    Punia et al., 2021; Ukwatta et al., 2021). A sum of thirty eight QTLs affecting
    salt tolerance have been recognized from an RIL population including 181 lines
    originated from a cross between L-Tian and Shihong 137 (Wang et al., 2014). Six
    of these QTLs have been identified as major QTLs, accounting for more than 10%
    of phenotypic variation. Salt tolerance mechanism differs between germination
    through seedling stages. More research is required before applying the recognized
    QTLs in MAS. Due to the unpredictability of the timing, duration, and intensity
    of drought occurrence in the natural environment, as well as the difficulties
    of constructing screening environments, traditional breeding techniques have made
    direct selection for drought resistance components slow and challenging. Consequently,
    the use of molecular markers in QTL analysis based on meticulously managed repeatable
    testing has the ability to overcome difficulties associated with variable and
    unpredictable onset of moisture stress or the confounding influence of other related
    stresses such as heat (Ejeta et al., 2000). Four QTLs conferring pre-flowering
    drought tolerance in sorghum from RILs derived from the cross (SC 56 Tx7000),
    however, theses QTLs are inconsistent across environments. Numerous stay green
    QTLs related to post-flowering drought tolerance have been mapped and molecular
    markers associated to these QTLs are available (Sanchez et al., 2002; Kassahun
    et al., 2010). Post-flowering drought stress is also referred to as “stay green”
    since these plants retain chlorophyll in their leaves and can sustain photosynthesis
    for longer in comparison to “senescent” genotypes under drought stress. In comparison
    to pre-flowering drought stress, more QTLs related to several morphological traits
    have been recognized under post-flowering drought stress. By using 170 RFLP and
    RAPD markers, a set of 98 RILs derived from a cross between B35 x TX7078 were
    utilized to identify 5 QTLs for yield stability, 3 for seed weight stability,
    2 for grain yield and 6 for stay green under post flowering drought stress (Tuinstra
    et al., 1997). By using 125 RILs, derived from Tx700 and SC56 and 170 RFLP markers
    under drought, QTLs controlling plant height (6 QTLs), flowering time (5 QTLs),
    pre-flowering drought tolerance (7 QTLs), lodging tolerance (3 QTLs), stay green
    (14 QTLs) were recognized in sorghum (Kebede et al., 2001). For proper plant growth,
    development and higher yield, fourteen nutrients are necessary and each of these
    nutrients has a particular role in developmental processes of plants (Narayan
    et al., 2022). QTLs and transporters for other nutrients-related traits such as
    Mg, Mo, Cl, Mn, Zn, Co, Ni, and Fe have not yet been recognized. There are less
    studies in sorghum related to nutrient usage efficiency in comparison to rice,
    wheat, and maize. More studies should be carried out to uncover QTLs and transporters
    for all of these nutrients in order to increase nutrient usage efficiency in sorghum.
    Marker-assisted breeding for agronomic traits As sequencing and phenotyping tools
    continue to improve rapidly, a number of key genetic loci and genes regulating
    sorghum agronomical traits have been found, mostly by genome-wide association
    studies, quantitative trait locus mapping, and mutant analyses (Kaur et al., 2021;
    Chakrabarty et al., 2022; Niu et al., 2022). The major agronomical traits that
    affect sorghum yield are tiller numbers, grains per panicle, and grains weight
    (Somegowda et al., 2022). Around 340 QTLs related to grain yield are recognized
    in sorghum (Mace et al., 2019). In a panel of 354 accessions with 265,487 SNPs,
    nine hotspots related to seed weight were identified (Zhang et al., 2015). Boyles
    et al. (2016) detected 53, 19, and 36 significant SNPs related to grain number
    per main panicle, 1000 grain weight, and grain yield per main panicle, respectively.
    A large-scale GWAS research was conducted on a panel of 837 accessions of sorghum
    and a BC-NAM population of 1421 populations, being able to isolate grain size
    81 QTLs (Tao et al., 2020). In order to develop early flowering sorghum crops,
    the Sorghum Crop Improvement Program (SCIP) has made use of prominent sorghum
    accessions such as BTx406 and SM100, both of which hold recessive alleles of Sbprr37
    and Sbghd7. In addition, it has been found that genes such as SbMED12, LD and
    SbSUC9 are connected to the process of maturation (Upadhyaya et al., 2013). Two
    significant QTLs on LG1 are associated with protein digestibility; one QTL (connected
    with Xtxp11) negatively affects protein digestibility, whereas the second QTL
    (linked with Xtxp88) 20 cm distant positively affects protein digestibility (Winn
    et al., 2009). Four main loci controlling sorghum plant height have been identified
    (i.e., Dw1, Dw2, Dw3, and Dw4) of which Dw2 and Dw3 show pleiotropic effects.
    Significant progress has been made in the identification of genetic loci affecting
    renewable energy-related traits in sorghum. A key characteristic of sweet sorghum
    is its juicy stem (sugar-rich). In association analysis of traits related to sugar
    including sugar volume, midrib color, and 42,926 SNPs related to sugar yield,
    Burks and colleagues (2015) found a significant relationship at a distance of
    51.8 Mb (on chromosome 6), which corresponds to a region that contains a dry midrib
    locus. Panicle length, width, weight, the number of primary branches per panicle,
    the number of seeds per panicle, and the panicle harvest index are regarded as
    the most significant components of panicle directly influencing the total grain
    yield (Hmon et al., 2013). Sorghum’s inflorescence architecture has been studied
    less than that of other Poaceae species (Witt Hmon et al., 2014; Nagaraja Reddy
    et al., 2013). A major QTL, QPle-sbi06-2, between markers GlumeT-Xxp145 on LG
    6 that accounts for more than fifty percent of the variation in panicle length
    was identified (Srinivas et al., 2009a). This QTL is also co-located with the
    major height QTL (Dw2) and the major maturity gene (Ma1). Major QTL (>10%) for
    panicle length have been identified, with 12 being meta-QTL with phenotypic variation
    ranging from 5.91%–50.4% discovered in various genetic backgrounds (Nagaraja Reddy
    et al., 2013; Zou et al., 2012; Witt Hmon et al., 2014). Another trait associated
    with grain yield is panicle width, for which seven major QTL have been identified
    (Hart et al., 2001). With 14%–20% phenotypic variation, five major QTLs pertaining
    to primary and secondary seed branches have been recognized in diverse genetic
    backgrounds (Brown et al., 2006; Srinivas et al., 2009b). Four major loci influencing
    sorghum plant height have been identified (Dw1, Dw2, Dw3, and Dw4), with Dw2 and
    Dw3 exhibiting pleiotropic effects. Following linkage and linkage disequilibrium
    mapping, numerous quantitative trait loci (QTL) for plant height in sorghum were
    discovered (Higgins et al., 2014; Hilley et al., 2016). QTL with significant effects
    on plant height have been identified in a variety of genetic backgrounds and have
    been linked to qualitative loci, Dw1 on SBI-09, Dw2 on SBI-06, and Dw3 on SBI-07
    (Morris et al., 2013a; Nagaraja Reddy et al., 2013; Higgins et al., 2014; Zhao
    et al., 2016). The map position of Dw2 on SBI-06 on the consensus map strictly
    linked with DArT markers, sPB-7169 and sPB-1395, and Dw3 between a simple sequence
    repeat marker, mcbCIR300 and a DArT marker, SSCIR57 on SBI-07 was registered (Mace
    and Jordan, 2011). The map position of Dw4 has not yet been reported. Morris et
    al. (2013b) suggested that the Dw2 phenotype is caused by a loss of function in
    a sorghum histone deacetylase gene (Sobic.006G067600) that controls plant height
    in other crops such as rice, maize, and Arabidopsis. Some major QTLs identified
    for agronomic traits are given in Table 9. table 9 TABLE 9. QTLs identified for
    agronomic traits in sorghum. Marker-assisted breeding for nutritional and quality
    traits Sorghum has lower protein digestibility than other cereal grains, which
    is thought to be due to disulfide cross-linking in the b- and g-kafirins. Two
    major QTL on LG 1 are related with protein digestibility: one QTL (linked with
    Xtxp11) has an unfavorable effect on digestibility, while another QTL (linked
    with Xtxp88) 20 cm away has a favorable effect o digestibility (Winn et al., 2009).
    Association mapping for grain quality in a diverse sorghum collection identified
    SNPs in several genes (Sukumaran et al., 2016). An SNP on the candidate gene SSIIa
    located on LG 10 was associated with kernel hardness and explained 8% of the variation
    in the trait. SNPs associated with kernel hardness (SB00214.1 and SB00214.2) explained
    10% of variation in the trait and they were located in the locus pSB1700 on LG
    3. SNPs SB00156.1 and SB00054.1 associated with calcium content were located in
    LG 3 at 50 and 59 cm, respectively. SB00156.1 was located in a locus, pSB0289,
    which was predicted to produce serine/threonine protein kinase. An SNP on the
    starch synthase IIb (SSIIb) gene on LG 4 was found to be significantly associated
    with starch content and explained 10% of the variation in the trait. Significant
    progress has been made in the identification of genetic loci affecting renewable
    energy-related traits in sorghum. A key characteristic of sweet sorghum is its
    juicy stem (sugar-rich). In association analysis of traits related to sugar including
    sugar volume, midrib color, and 42,926 SNPs related to sugar yield, Burks et al.
    (2015) found a significant relationship at a distance of 51.8 Mb (on chromosome
    6), which corresponds to a region that contains a dry midrib locus. Ritter et
    al. (2008) conducted an analysis of QTL for stem sugar-related and other agronomic
    traits using a population derived from sweet sorghum (“R9188”) and grain sorghum
    (“R9403463-2-1”). QTL were recognized for all sugar traits and were largely co-located
    to five locations (SBI-01, SBI-03, SBI-05, SBI-06, and SBI-10). For sucrose content,
    three major QTL were consistently detected on SBI-06, which were also co-mapped
    with sugar content and Brix. A major QTL was also detected on SBI-05 related to
    SSR marker, mSSCIR12, where a major QTL for sugar content also co-located. Two
    major QTLs for fructose and sucrose content were co-located on SBI-06 near Xtxp547
    marker explaining 18%–24%, respectively. Calviño et al. (2008) compared genes
    in grain (BT 623) and sweet (Rio) sorghum to identify genes involved in sugar
    accumulation and lignocellulose synthesis. In sweet sorghum, “Rio,” 132 transcripts
    were downregulated and 63 were upregulated. A saposin-like type B gene displayed
    the highest level of differential expression among the upregulated transcripts
    in “Rio.” Numerous transcripts related to carbohydrate metabolism were upregulated,
    such as hexokinase 8; sorbitol dehydrogenase; carbohydrate phosphorylase; and
    NADP-malic enzyme. Transcripts that were downregulated included sucrose synthase
    2 and fructokinase 2, a- and b-galactosidases, and several others related to cell
    wall activities like cellulose synthase 1, 7, 9 and cellulose synthase catalytic
    subunit 12 involved in cellulose synthesis. Furthermore, a series of genes encoding
    proteins in lignin synthesis like cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase, cinnamoyl-CoA
    reductase, caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase, 4-coumarate:coenzyme A ligase were
    also downregulated. Bihmidine et al. (2016) investigated the expression of two
    additional classes of sucrose transport proteins, Tonoplast Sugar Transporters
    and SWEETs, for sucrose accumulation in sweet sorghum stems and validated the
    differential expression of these two genes in grain and sweet sorghum stalks.
    Functional markers Advancements in molecular biology, such as genomics, genome
    editing, and high-throughput sequencing, make cultivar development faster and
    more precise (Salgotra et al., 2014). Recognizing genes and functional markers
    (FMs) that are strongly associated with plant phenotypic variation is a difficult
    task. FMs have an advantage over other plant breeding markers due to their close
    genomic association with phenotypes. Consequently, FMs may facilitate the direct
    selection of genes associated with phenotypic traits, thereby enhancing the selection
    efficiencies required to develop varieties. Using marker-assisted selection (MAS)
    techniques, FMs are utilized in precision breeding for agronomic and quality traits
    as well as breeding for abiotic and biotic stress resistance. FMs are DNA markers
    that have been derived from functionally defined sequence motifs (Anderson and
    Lubberstedt, 2003). Therefore, SNPs as FMs are superior to RDMs and genic molecular
    markers (GMMs) in plant breeding. Although GMMs may exist within a gene of interest,
    they may not be functionally linked to the phenotypic trait of interest, which
    could result in false selection in MAS. FMs for the improvement of agronomic traits,
    quality traits, and stress resistance Advancement in sequencing techniques allow
    the identification of SNPs and indels related to several economically essential
    traits; FM development is thus enabled (Kage et al., 2016). Indels may cause phenotypic
    variation as a result of extensive genomic effects, which are accompanied by the
    possibility of elimination from natural selection. Therefore, SNP-derived FMs
    are superior to indel-derived markers due to the widespread distribution of FMs
    throughout the genome (Li et al., 2012). Various FMs for agronomic, quality, and
    biotic and abiotic stress resistances have been developed (Table 10) and pyramided
    in various crops using MAS, MABB, MARS, and GS techniques (Kage et al., 2016).
    Quality characteristics are essential for a variety of reasons, including satisfying
    consumer preferences. FMs have been successfully utilized in MAS to enhance the
    nutritional value of crops. In sorghum, an InDel-based FM for the SbBADH2 gene
    responsible for fragrance has been developed. This FM has been utilized to identify
    sorghum genotypes with high fragrance, which can then be utilized in sorghum breeding
    (Zanan et al., 2016). An FM has been developed for the SbMATE gene, which confers
    aluminum stress tolerance in sorghum (Too et al., 2018). The SbMATE FM assists
    in screening sorghum germplasm for aluminum stress tolerance, which can then be
    used in breeding. Li et al. (2016) reported that in sorghum, FM tightly linked
    to the seed dormancy QTL may be used in marker-assisted selection for seed dormancy.
    table 10 TABLE 10. Functional molecular markers (FMMs) developed for various traits
    in sorghum. Transcriptomics Transcriptomics is uncovering the differential expression
    of genes in a biological system. Transcriptome analysis innovations such as massively
    parallel signature sequencing (MPSS), sequencing-based approaches (RNAseq) and
    microarrays, have made it possible to comprehend the transcriptomic alterations
    that occur under various developmental or environmental stress conditions. Analysis
    of these transcriptomic alterations has yielded a comprehensive understanding
    of the cellular and molecular responses involved in plant development in response
    to stress tolerance (Johnson et al., 2014). RNA-Seq facilitates the identification
    and quantification of transcripts via a high-throughput sequencing assay. In addition
    to quantifying gene expression over a wider dynamic range, this method is extremely
    useful for identifying alternative splicing events (Wang et al., 2019). Even though
    it has been the most popular method for transcript profiling in numerous crop
    species, it fails detecting multiple full-length transcripts that are reconstructed
    from short-read sequences (Steijger et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2016). Because
    of that limitation, RNA-Seq is inadequate for examining gene regulation, the protein-coding
    capacity of the genome, and ultimately phenotypic diversity. Advanced techniques
    such as Oxford Nanopore and PacBio Single Molecule Sequencing are better suited
    to identify comprehensively full-length transcripts because they directly generate
    full-length cDNA sequences (Wang et al., 2016). Abdel-Ghany et al. (2016) sequenced
    the BTx623 sorghum transcriptome, using Pacific Biosciences singlemolecule real-time
    sequencing, resulting in the identification of transcriptome-wide full length
    isoforms with >11,000 novel splice isoforms and alternative splicing and alternative
    polyadenylation (APA) ∼11,000 expressed genes and >2,100 novel genes, enhancing
    sorghum genes annotation. Sorghum, as one of the few climate-resilient crops,
    has an inherent ability to adapt to climate change, particularly during severe
    abiotic stress conditions (i.e., drought, elevated temperature, salinity … ) (Carpita
    and McCann, 2008). This makes sorghum a model of choice for understanding the
    molecular mechanisms involved in stress adaptation (Mace et al., 2013). Advances
    in NGS technologies, as well as the availability of complete genome sequences
    of several sorghum genotypes, provide excellent opportunities for studying molecular
    mechanisms at the transcriptome level (Mace et al., 2013). Determining the transcriptional
    response of sorghum to both drought and heat stresses individually and in combination
    by Johnson et al. (2014) using microarrays consisting of 28,585 gene probes exposed
    differential expression of genes to the tune of ∼4% and 18% following drought
    and heat stresses, respectively, while ∼20% genes revealed differential expression
    in response to combined stress. This study demonstrated evidence of sorghum’s
    specific response to individual stresses as well as crosstalk to combined heat
    and drought stresses. Sorghum plants with the stay-green trait can retain green
    leaf area even during maturity under drought conditions and yield more than their
    senescent counterparts. A comparison of gene expression between stay-green (B35)
    and senescent (R16) cultivars for the purpose of elucidating the molecular and
    physiological basis of drought tolerance revealed that the differentially expressed
    transcripts were associated with the response to osmotic stress. Specifically,
    the expression of delta1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase 2 (P5CS2) was higher
    in the stay-green line as compared to senescent line, and this high expression
    showed correlation with higher proline levels (Johnson et al., 2015). A comparative
    transcriptome analysis between two cultivars (623B and Henong 16) under the imposition
    of salt treatment (0.8% NaCl) for 0, 48, and 72 h conducted by Cui et al. (2018)
    reported a total of 5647 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Functional annotation
    of these DEGs showed that majority of them are involved in regulation of transcription,
    signal transduction, and secondary metabolism, mainly genes encoding kinases and
    transcription factors. Zhang et al. (2019) identified 510, 559, and 3687 DEGs
    in leaves and 3368, 5093, and 4635 DEGs in roots that responded to mild drought,
    severe drought, and re-watering treatments, respectively, in an RNA-Seq-based
    transcriptomic profiling of sorghum leaves and roots under drought. Among them,
    190 common DEGs in leaves and 1644 common DEGs in roots were responsive to mild
    drought, severe drought, and re-watering environment. According to gene ontology
    (GO) enrichment analysis, these genes are linked with water deprivation, abscisic
    acid stimulation, and reactive oxygen species. Furthermore, genomic regions enriched
    with drought-responsive genes encoding heat shock protein (HSPs), expansin, and
    aquaporin could be used as potential targets for genetic improvement of drought
    tolerance in sorghum. A study on sorghum’s tolerance to progressive water deficit
    and re-watering using a South African landrace (LR6) and cDNA microarrays containing
    35,899 transcript probes revealed 902 transcripts that were differentially expressed
    in response to the aforementioned treatments (Devnarain et al., 2019). Among the
    26 genes recognized to be involved in response to abiotic stimulus, the recognition
    of β-alanine betaine in sorghum leaf extracts and substantial increase in its
    relative abundance during severe stress highlighted the involvement of β-alanine
    betaine biosynthesis in imparting drought tolerance in sorghum establishment and
    seedling growth. Chopra et al. (2015) used RNA-Seq with control and cold stress
    treatments to profile the transcriptomes of cold-sensitive (BTx623) and cold-tolerant
    (HongkeZi) sorghum lines in order to comprehend the molecular mechanism underlying
    cold tolerance. The study discovered transcription factors like dehydration-responsive
    element-binding factors, C-repeat binding factors, and ethylene-responsive transcription
    factors that were significantly upregulated in cold-tolerant lines during cold
    stress. Furthermore, under cold stress, differential regulation of genes such
    as plant cytochromes, glutathione s-transferases, and heat shock proteins was
    observed between cold-tolerant and cold-sensitive lines. In an other study by
    Marla et al. (2017) comprising of RNA sequencing of seedlings of a chilling-tolerant
    Chinese accession along with a chilling-sensitive US reference line and mass spectrometry
    of four chilling-tolerant Chinese accessions along with two US reference lines
    indicated chilling-induced upregulation of C-repeat binding factor (CBF) (cold-response
    regulator) and genes involved in detoxification of reactive oxygen, biosynthesis
    of jasmonic acid, and phospholipase Da1 (PLDa1) (lipid remodeling gene) in the
    chilling-tolerant Chinese accession. Moreover, the results showed the involvement
    of CBF-mediated transcriptional regulation, galactolipid and phospholipid remodeling,
    and jasmonic acid responsible for chilling adaptation in Chinese sorghums. Precise
    annotation of transcriptional unit and its expression pattern is vital for transcriptome
    analysis, and a collection of full-length cDNA (FL-cDNA) facilitates this. A normalized
    FL-cDNA library was constructed in sorghum from eight different growth stages
    of aerial tissues; 37,607 clones were isolated and sequenced to obtain 38,981
    expressed sequence tags (ESTs). A total of 272 novel genes, 323 antisense transcripts,
    and 1672 candidate isoforms were annotated, and the expression of 70.6% of these
    novel genes were confirmed by spikelet-, seed-, and stem-specific RNA-Seq analysis.
    A transcriptome database (MOROKOSHI) was created with this data along with 23
    sorghum RNA-Seq data available in the public domain and was displayed on a genome
    browser (Makita et al., 2014). SorghumFDB, a platform for functional annotations
    of genome and multidimensional network analyses, was developed by Tian et al.
    (2016), which includes annotations of whole genome assemblies, miRNA sequences
    and their targets, common gene families, gene networks using transcriptome data,
    as well as annotation elements for multiple gene function. This is useful for
    studying each gene’s expression profile in order to identify a group of genes
    with the most similar expression. Visualization tools like Cytoscape, Gbrowse,
    and open-flash-chart as well as sequence analysis tools like GSEA, BLAST, motif
    significance analysis, and pattern set were integrated in the database for the
    determination of functional prediction. These databases will aid in understanding
    the functional relationships between genes, gene co-expression, and improving
    the accuracy of functional genomics analyses, resulting in a better understanding
    of gene regulatory networks involved in sorghum genetic improvement. Application
    of GWAS in sorghum The accomplishment of molecular plant breeding is heavily restricted
    to a small number of characteristics governed by major impact genes as a result
    of the inherent drawbacks of low genome insurance of molecular markers, obstacles
    in locating an enormous list of biological variation, and the inescapable linkage
    drag associated with the selection of suitable regions of chromosomes. Molecular
    plant breeding is currently only feasible for a select few of these characteristics
    (Gupta et al., 2010). Additionally, in order to speed breeding procedures, advances
    in theoretical framework as well as technological advancements are required. Development
    of next-generation sequencing, genome editing, genome selection, molecular modules,
    non-invasive high throughput phenomics, and GWAS has revolutionized plant breeding’s
    scope by facilitating the development of numerous new tools enabling the more
    efficient exploitation of previously restored natural or artificially created
    variations (Chen B. R. et al., 2019; Godwin et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2020). The
    GWAS is an effective approach for determining the inheritance pattern of complex
    agronomical traits by applying a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) biomarker
    that has been effectively employed in the investigation of the genetic basis of
    complex agronomical traits. GWAS has been used to identify significant genomic
    regions and genes that control important complex traits in sorghum (Table 11).
    Morris et al. (2013b) created the most widely used panel and genotyped it using
    genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS), yielding a total of 265,487 SNPs. This panel was
    then used to explore the genetic basis of yield and its related traits like plant
    height, inflorescence morphology, grain quality traits, stalk rot and anthracnose
    (Colletotrichum sublineolum) disease resistance (Cuevas et al., 2018; Cuevas et
    al., 2019; Hao et al., 2021). Increasing crop adaptation to environment is essential
    for guaranteeing sustainable food supply since environment has a considerable
    impact on agricultural performance. In regard to the previously described highly
    complicated agronomical traits, extensive research on G x E interaction in sorghum
    has been initiated. Since its domestication, sorghum has spread extensively across
    varied agroecological zones, and it is easy for studying G x E interaction. Lasky
    et al. (2015) described the allelic associations with bio-climatic and soil contours
    in a collection of 1943 sorghum accessions which were investigated using 104,627
    SNPs. Results disclosed that factors related to environment could illustrate a
    significant portion of SNP alteration and genic SNPs were boosted for environmental
    (Al toxicity and drought) associations. They proposed that SNP integration knowledge
    could be used to assess and adapt to traits in a given environment. Another study
    by Olatoye et al. (2018) regarding genome-wide association mapping of precipitation
    parameters discovered a minor but substantial involvement of clinical modification,
    which is influencing nucleotide alteration in Nigerian sorghum germplasms and
    revealed that the genes inherent morphology with photoperiod fluctuation play
    important roles in adaptation against drought. table 11 TABLE 11. Genome Wide
    Association Studies (GWAS) study in sorghum. Faye et al. (2019) used 213,916 SNPs
    in 421 Senegalese sorghum germplasm accessions to analyze genomic variation and
    domains altered by environmental issues. This was done by analyzing the genomic
    differences between the accessions. Flora transcription factors along with stay
    green aided in climate tolerance in the Sudanian and Sahelian zones. Wang J. et
    al. (2020) collected a total of 1901 georeferenced sorghum accessions and the
    correlation study of seed bulk variation with precipitation gradient proved that
    seed bulk variation was responsive to precipitation gradient. Detailed genomic
    understanding of adaptive features will aid in predicting how well sorghum will
    perform in various environmental situations. Adaptive and agronomic features are
    complicated in nature and influenced by a number of environmental and the genetic
    factors. The collected data typically shows that the majority of genetic loci
    can only account for a modest portion of phenotypic variation. We should be aware
    that descriptive statistics and models, which are largely used in GWAS, may result
    in erroneous negative or positive results. GWAS results can all be impacted by
    SNP frequency, phenotypic precision, population structure, and population size.
    However, GBS, which is prone to producing significant amounts of missing data,
    accounts for the majority of the genetic variants in sorghum during the studies
    by (Annicchiarico et al., 2015). Consequently, a bigger size of the population
    and a greater SNP mass are required. Appropriate statistical techniques must also
    be established to deal with greater marker frequencies and larger sample sizes.
    Conventional GWAS frequently screens out uncommon variants with MAF ≥ 0.05, which
    may represent morphological variance, in favor of the common variants with MAF
    < 0.05 that are the primary focus of the study. So, it is important to come up
    with a unique statistical and association research method for these unusual differences
    in order to fill the gaps in information. Genetic transformation in sorghum The
    inability to transform sorghum is a key obstacle to its broad usage as a bioenergy
    source in the emerging bio-economy and in a research planning system. Sorghum
    transformation is difficult from a technological standpoint, expensive, and time-consuming,
    and it can only be achieved for few genotypes. Because of its genotype-dependent
    responses, short-term plant regeneration capacities, production of phenolic chemicals
    and acclimation challenges, sorghum showed resistant to transformation during
    tissue culturing (Maheswari et al., 2006; Altpeter et al., 2016). Since the introduction
    of the concept of transgenic sorghum, a great deal of progress has been accomplished
    (Casas et al., 1993) (Figure 4). Casas et al. (1993) achieved a 0.3 percent transformation
    efficiency by inducing callus development for particle bombardment in immature
    embryos from the genotype P898012. Since then, by using the genotype Tx430, the
    process has been enhanced to the point where it now achieves up to 46.6% efficiency
    (Belide et al., 2017). When the transgene is introduced by inoculation with Agrobacterium
    tumefaciens, the efficiency of transformation has enhanced from 9.7% to 33%. (Zhao
    et al., 2000; Wu et al., 2014). Selection of genotype is an essential part of
    tissue culture and, as a result, transformation success. Because of its exposure
    to elevated regeneration frequency and callus induction, the grain sorghum inbred
    line known as Tx430 has seen a significant uptick in usage over the course of
    the past decade (Wu et al., 2014; Belide et al., 2017). However, Tx430 was associated
    with 7 bioenergy parental sorghum lines using the protocols from Wu et al. (2014)
    and Liu and Godwin, (2012). The line Tx430 showed a high callus multiplication
    but a moderate phenolic release, whereas the lines Rio and PI329311 had the highest
    regeneration rates as reported by Flinn et al. (2020). figure 4 FIGURE 4. Sorghum
    transformation progress timeline. Novel biotechnological approaches for sorghum
    breeding Genome editing Emerging genome editing technologies provide a unique
    opportunity to boost agricultural output and quality through the targeted change
    of genes that influence traits like stress tolerance and nutrient uptake (Kamthan
    et al., 2016; Anwar and Kim, 2020). The pioneer work on sorghum genome editing
    was initiated by Jiang et al., 2013. The DsRED2 specific coding region was targeted
    by designing a 20 bp specific guide RNA (sgRNA). The integration of guide RNA
    was followed under the control of the U6 promoter from rice. For selectable and
    visual markers, the GFP-NptII gene was integrated with the expression vector under
    the control of the CaMV 35s promoter. Two weeks post-transformation, GFP expression
    was detected in groups of cells, showing the presence of stably transformed cells.
    Five of the 18 cell groups which were GFP-positive also expressed DsRED2. This
    approaches the theoretical maximum frequency of one-third for reading frame rescue
    of DsRED2 by NHEJ, suggesting that the gene editing in transformed cells was highly
    efficient. However, although Jiang et al. (2013) were successful in establishing
    gene editing using CRISPR/Cas9, the target gene was co-introduced, and was therefore
    not endogenous to sorghum. The edited cells were not regenerated into plants and
    sequencing evidence of the edits was not provided. The first report of successful
    endogenous gene editing in sorghum was reported by Che et al. (2018) who improved
    the transformation method by using a tripartite vector system to boost efficiency.
    This technique was used to mutagenize the specific histone H3 of sorghum at centromere
    locus. One successful example of editing whole gene families in sorghum was reported
    by Li et al. (2018). This study was performed to enhance sorghum grain quality.
    Both the Cas9 as well as the sgRNA were deployed inside of a binary vector (pBUN421),
    which was then driven by promoters for maize ubiquitin and rice U3, respectively.
    For the purpose of effective co-targeting of the complete gene family, a singular
    sgRNA was developed with the intention of focusing on the extremely conserved
    N-terminal ER signal. This was the first study in which multiple targets were
    edited successfully with one sgRNA in sorghum. As seen in Table 12, a high editing
    efficiency of 92.4% was reported. In this context, it is important to note that
    the study targeted 20 genes with one sgRNA, only one of which needed to be edited
    for the event to be considered an edited event, which contributed to the elevated
    editing efficiency. The studies discussed thus far all employed a single sgRNA
    cassette for gene targeting. However, multiplex gene editing has also been demonstrated
    using two guide RNAs to Table 1 simultaneously target two distinct endogenous
    genes (Char et al., 2020a). A stable knockout of the cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase
    (CAD) gene in the variant Tx430 was created utilizing the biolistic delivery method
    reported by Liu et al. (2019) employing a particle inflow gun (PIG). A 25% editing
    efficiency was reported, but no information about the lines was given because
    the publication just described the technique. The delivery of genome editing tools
    to sorghum via Agrobacterium has been described in two studies (Sander, 2019;
    Char et al., 2020b). table 12 TABLE 12. List of genome editing studies in sorghum.
    Genomic selection Genomic selection (GS) is one effective breeding tool in the
    selection of complex quantitative traits, like yield. That tool has been effectively
    applied in plant breeding (Meuwissen et al., 2016) and is substantially attaining
    recognition among plant breeders, specifically for those traits that are challenging
    to evaluate (Crossa et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2020). Sorghum has proven to be one
    of the best crop for using genomic selection because of the availability of the
    reference genome sequence and genomic resources. Nonetheless, genomic selection
    for sorghum improvement is less prevalent than for wheat and maize. For the first
    time, genomic selection in sorghum targeting plant height demonstrated that predicted
    plant height based on UAV sensing had a strong correlation with measured plant
    height. Several recent articles regarding genomic selection for sorghum improvement
    (de Oliveira et al., 2018; Hunt et al., 2018; Habyarimana and Lopez-Cruz, 2019;
    Velazco et al., 2019) have revealed the potential of this approach for achieving
    genetic gain in sorghum breeding programs. In sorghum, GS primarily focused on
    model training using a range of training populations like natural population,
    mixed populations, and testcross hybrids (Yu et al., 2016; Habyarimana et al.,
    2020). In addition, more research incorporating phenotypic and genotypic data
    from natural or breeding populations should be conducted to reveal the genetic
    mechanisms governing several critical agronomic traits. Sorghum genetic diversity
    that has been conserved in the form of germplasm allows for the identification
    of new alleles and genes responsible for conferring desirable traits. It is necessary
    to preform phenotypic and genotypic characterization on the entire germplasm of
    sorghum in order to do full justice to its collection as well as conservation
    efforts. It will result in fully characterized raw material that can be used for
    genetic improvement. This would also aid with parent selection, identifying genes
    and markers for all prominent traits, and achieving the required degree of trait
    expression through genomic selection. This tool has the ability to enable sorghum
    cultivators, all involved sectors, and the industry to reach more profitable outcomes.
    Breeders of forage sorghum can use a comprehensive DNA fingerprint to evaluate
    the genetic potential of untested individuals, allowing them to make genomic predictions
    for use in selection. It allows to shorten the breeding cycle, improve selection
    precision, and increase the rate of genetic gain in forage species. A panel of
    976 sorghum accessions were genotyped utilizing 0.72 million SNPs obtained using
    genotyping-by-sequencing for a study involving GS for biomass traits. A prediction
    model was developed to predict the biomass-related attributes of the remaining
    untested germplasm using the collection of 300 best representative accessions
    that were phenotyped for these variables (Yu et al., 2014). It is obvious that
    GS is a potential tool for crop improvement in the near future and can modernize
    the traditional method of plant breeding. The availability of high throughput
    phenomics platforms will help this even more. Future outlooks Improving agricultural
    production is critical to ensure food security and to meet the needs of the continuously
    increasing world population. Particularly, meeting the food demand of developing
    countries in Africa and Asia is quite challenging. Among other crops, sorghum
    also holds good position in fulfilling the feed and food requirements of poor
    people in various countries in Africa and Asia. Abiotic stresses severely affects
    sorghum production across the world. Marker Assisted Breeding (MAB) is a promising
    tool, among others, in the framework of modern plant breeding. MAB has established
    itself as a powerful tool for genetic manipulation of crops for crop improvement
    by means of agronomic traits, qualitative and quantitative traits, and biotic
    and abiotic stress resistance. MAB provides numerous notable advantages over traditional
    phenotype-based selection techniques. It can be efficiently used in germplasm
    characterization, QTL mapping, gene pyramiding, genetic diversity, and evolutionary
    and phylogenetic studies. To date, the practical use of MAB in plant breeding
    has been confined to simple traits with monogenic or oligogenic inheritance. Through
    MAB, genetic improvement of traits with complicated inheritance remains a challenge.
    Factors like poor resolution of QTLs on the genetic map, a lack of robust markers,
    imprecise estimates of QTL locations and effects, non-validation of marker-trait
    associations, genetic background, epistasis, a lack of cost-effective marker genotyping
    systems, G x E interactions, a knowledge gap in plant breeders, a lack of wet
    lab facilities, and other factors can all contribute to the low visible impact
    of marker assisted breeding. Aside from drought stress, very few QTLs have been
    discovered in sorghum under abiotic stress conditions. There are numerous desirable
    agronomic attributes best represented by sorghum, however, the genes and QTLs
    for these traits have yet to be uncovered. Numerous root QTLs have been explored
    in maize and rice but no efforts in this regard under abiotic stresses have been
    made in sorghum. More research is needed to uncover QTLs for root, agro-morphological,
    and yield-related attributes that could help to increase sorghum growth and yield.
    Genome editing technologies like CRISPR, which have lately gained popularity,
    may be useful in creating mutants for improved sorghum performance under abiotic
    stresses. In general, the traits of sorghum for abiotic stress tolerance have
    still to be investigated however, few functional genomics and molecular breeding
    studies have been started but a thorough understanding of these studies is necessary
    to enhance the development and yield of sorghum under stresses. Sorghum is considered
    to be a model crop among cereals for comparative genetics to reveal different
    physiological mechanisms underlying drought and heat tolerance due to its small
    genome size, wide diversity and germplasm resources, whole-genome sequence availability,
    array of marker systems and high-density linkage maps. Several studies have revealed
    QTLs for numerous attributes, and the integration of linkage maps has produced
    saturated consensus maps. Several of these QTL have been validated in various
    genetic contexts and are therefore appropriate for marker-assisted breeding in
    sorghum. For attaining higher genetic gains, it is necessary for plant breeders
    to integrate MAB into conventional breeding tools. The association of MAB with
    next-generation sequencing, cisgenetics, epigenetics, and CRISPR technology for
    genome editing can lead to the establishment of a new platform of low-cost, high-throughput
    crop improvement in the coming years. In the future, innovations in cost-effective
    and more precise molecular breeding are likely to be seen for the precise and
    quick development of new potent plant varieties by effective incorporation of
    novel traits and improvement in economically important plants. Author contributions

  description: Rice cultivation is popular in low-lying areas such as deltas, but
    climate change threatens the viability of the crop. In recent decades, the resilience
    of deltas to sea level rise (SLR) has been influenced by the reduction of sediment
    load from rivers due to the construction of dams, disrupting natural deposition
    in deltaic plains. Sediment and organic matter accumulation in wetlands are key
    to vertical accretion in the face of SLR and soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration.
    In this sense, deltaic rice fields can retain sediments as well as wetlands and
    promote SOC sequestration, which is effective in adapting to SLR. In the Ebro
    Delta, the sediments that reached the fields through irrigation channels were
    used to build up and form rice fields in the wetlands of the area. We hypothesize
    that this sedimentation has been key to vertical accretion and SOC sequestration
    in rice fields. These processes were simulated by developing a process-based cohort
    model inspired by accretion in marsh equilibrium models (MEM). The model was able
    to simulate the soil carbon profile of rice fields in the Ebro Delta, based on
    the soil-accretion concept and considering the spatial heterogeneity of the area.
    Its predictions of vertical accretion and carbon content were more accurate for
    mineral and clay-like soils than for organic and sandy soils. Topsoil decomposition
    rate and organic matter content were the parameters that most influenced predictions
    of total vertical accretion and final soil organic carbon stock. Simulations were
    carried out according to future climate change scenarios, considering restoration
    of river sediment flux, to evaluate effects on SOC sequestration and vertical
    accretion in rice fields. Results showed that only with significant river sediment
    restoration did rice fields show positive vertical accretion, which facilitates
    SOC sequestration.

  explanation: This is a highly relevant paper that meets the requirements of the
    review's intention and objective due to its specific focus on the potential impacts
    of river sediment reduction on rice production in the Ebro Delta and the potential
    role of soil organic matter in mitigating those impacts.
  extract_1: The progressive reduction in the suspended load of the river due to the
    construction of dams in the river basin marked the decrease in the annual accretion
    rate predicted by the model throughout the pre-dam period (Fig. 5C).
  extract_2: During model evaluation, mineral input during the post-dam period in
    rice fields from riparian and salt marsh habitats was set to the current estimated
    mineral input (0.01 g l-1 yr-1), due to their lower SOM content, while in fields
    with higher SOM content (M1, M2, P1, L1 and R2), it was set to larger values (0.1
    – 0.6 g l-1 yr-1).

    and rising sea levels. • Past sediment input into the Ebro Delta rice fields facilitated
    vertical accretion of the soil. • Soil accretion and SOC profile of paddy soils

    vertical accretion and SOC accumulation. • Scenarios of sediment input to rice
    fields are simulated. Abstract Rice cultivation is popular in low-lying areas

    sequestrationSedimentsCrop management 1. Introduction Rice is often cultivated
    in lowlands such as deltas; thus, rising sea levels threaten production due to
    increasing flooding risks, coastal erosion and soil salinization (Genua-Olmedo
    et al., 2016; McLean et al., 2001; Nicholls et al., 2007). It is estimated that
    during the 21st century, up to 50 % of the emerged area of deltas will become
    progressively covered by the sea (Syvitski et al., 2009), impacting both socioeconomic
    systems in these densely populated areas and ecosystem services (Brown and Nicholls,
    2015). In this sense, loss of crop productivity would decrease the soil organic
    carbon (SOC) sequestration capacity of rice paddies, compromising the global priority
    of achieving food security and mitigating climate change (Lal, 2004). Fluvial
    sediment input in deltas plays an important role in soil accretion and SOC sequestration
    through burial of organic matter, and both processes are key for maintaining the
    elevation of soil in relation to sea level (Day et al., 1995; Fennessy et al.,
    2019). One main cause of coastal erosion of deltas is construction of dams along
    rivers, which traps sediment and prevents its deposition in deltas, which decreases
    the resilience of deltas in the face of sea level rise (SLR) (Brown et al., 2018;
    Syvitski et al., 2005). Natural mechanisms and river-delta management options
    have been proposed to adapt to SLR and subsidence, such as restoring suspended
    loads in rivers and promoting rising grounds in delta wetlands and rice fields
    (Giosan et al., 2014; Ibáñez et al., 2014). In addition, restoring sediment inputs
    to deltas may alleviate soil salinization in rice paddies by increasing vertical
    accretion (Genua-Olmedo et al., 2016). In rice fields, sediment trapping has been
    reported (Ibáñez et al., 2014; Slaets et al., 2016), but effects of mineral and
    organic matter input on soil dynamics have not been thoroughly studied. Rice fields
    in lowlands are considered semi-natural wetlands that provide ecosystem services
    through mechanisms similar to those in natural wetlands and that are key for hydrological
    cycles, where the water that floods comes from river diversions or rain (Natuhara,
    2013). In the same way that coastal wetlands can be resilient to SLR and subsidence
    by accumulating mineral and organic matter (Morris et al., 2002), we hypothesize
    that rice paddies in deltas may have a similar capacity, but using different mechanisms.
    In saltmarshes, the feedback between water level and soil accretion is influenced
    by the tidal amplitude, which interrelates optimal growth of the plant community
    and sediment retention capacity through plant density (Morris et al., 2002). In
    rice fields, the arrival of sediments from irrigation channels could promote mineral-matter
    accretion and C accumulation by burying crop residues or protecting deeper organic
    layers from decomposition due to oxidation caused by plowing (Berhe et al., 2012;
    Fontaine et al., 2007; Morris et al., 2004). In addition, agricultural practices
    related mainly to SOC sequestration (i.e., incorporating straw in the soil and
    producing yields) (Liu et al., 2014) can also influence vertical accretion rates.
    Modeling ecosystem processes allows different scenarios to be simulated and is
    a useful tool for predicting results of processes in response to small changes
    in influential factors. For agrosystems, efforts have focused more on modeling
    processes related to relationships among production, nutrient dynamics, greenhouse
    gas emissions and SOC sequestration (DNDC, CENTURY, RothC (Coleman and Jenkinson,
    1996; Li, 1996; Parton et al., 1998)) and have been widely applied to different
    types of agrosystems and useful for predicting SOC sequestration under different
    scenarios (e.g. climatic, land management). However, these modeled processes focus
    mainly on the topsoil, with less consideration of changes in soil organic carbon
    (SOC) stock that may occur in it and in the subsoil (Falloon and Smith, 2010).
    For example, one sub-model of RothC simulates subsoil SOM dynamics below the topsoil,
    focusing on vertical C movements (Jenkinson and Coleman, 2008); however, RothC
    does not simulate sedimentation factors related to SOM stabilization, even though
    it is an important mechanism in soil SOC sequestration (Chmura et al., 2003).
    The aim of this study was to develop a model of rice field soil dynamics based
    on the Marsh Equilibrium Model (MEM) (Morris et al., 2002), modified to reflect
    rice field conditions. The specific goals of this study were to 1) model soil
    dynamics in deltaic rice fields considering both soil organic and mineral matter,
    2) simulate past soil accretion of representative deltaic rice fields undergoing
    progressive reduction of sediment inputs from irrigation channels and 3) predict
    future soil dynamics (i.e. SOC sequestration capacity and vertical accretion)
    under different scenarios of sediment input recovery, organic matter decomposition
    rate and crop yield. We used the model to simulate SOC sequestration and accretion
    rates in Ebro Delta rice fields because rice production is endangered by salt
    intrusion driven by SLR. Use of this model may help plan measures to adapt rice
    production in deltas to climate change. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Study area
    The Ebro Delta is an important area for rice cultivation (ca. 21,000 ha) and one
    of the most valuable coastal wetlands in western Europe. In the last 150 years,
    rice farming has transformed the landscape by converting up to 87 % of the natural
    wetlands (e.g. coastal lagoons, marshes, salt meadows, peatlands and riverine
    forests) (Benito et al., 2014). At present, 65 % of the emerged delta area is
    devoted to rice, while 15 % is urban areas and 20 % remains natural wetlands.
    The Ebro River is one of the most important tributaries to the Mediterranean Sea.
    It is the river with highest discharge in Spain (415 m3 s-1 annual mean), although
    this discharge shows a decreasing trend and high interannual variability between
    dry and wet years. During the past century, construction of dams for hydroelectric
    and irrigation purposes reduced its mean flow by up to 40 %. In addition, construction
    of dams in the 1960s in the lower Ebro (ca. 100 km upstream of the delta) reduced
    the suspended load by 99 % (Rovira and Ibàñez, 2007), thus preventing downstream
    transport and deposition of the sediments in the deltaic plain. Before dam construction,
    the hydrological connectivity through irrigation channels to the rice fields played
    a crucial role in sediment input to the Ebro Delta rice fields, first facilitating
    their creation in saltmarsh areas and then promoting their productivity via nutrient
    inputs and soil accretion. Rice in the Ebro Delta is cultivated in a single growing
    season, starting when the fields are flooded at the end of April, followed by
    sowing in early May and ending with harvest in September-October (followed by
    incorporating straw into the soil in October-November). Rice fields are irrigated
    by gravity through a network of irrigation channels fed by the Ebro River during
    the growing season and part of the fallow season. Post-harvest practices have
    been changing due to a variety of agri-environmental policies. Before the 1990s,
    each farmer decided how to manage straw, with burning being the most popular practice.
    Since the 1990s, however, incorporation of straw into the soil has been encouraged.
    In addition, from 1996 to 2015, flooding of fields in autumn and winter was promoted
    to favor waterfowl. Currently, each farmer decides whether to flood fields after
    harvest. Mean rice yield increased from ca. 4,000 to 6,000 kg ha-1 after chemical
    fertilizers and pesticides were introduced; however, annual yield varies widely,
    ranging from 5,000 to 10,000 kg ha-1 (Encuesta sobre Superficies y Rendimientos
    Cultivos [ESYRCE], 2023). 2.2. Soil data Eight rice fields were selected as representative
    of the converted wetland habitats in order to cover deltaic spatial heterogeneity:
    coastal lagoons (L1), saltmarshes (S1, S2), peatlands (P1), salt meadows (M1,
    M2) and riparian environments (R1, R2) (Fig. 1). Data on vertical SOC distribution
    and bulk density were obtained from soil cores 55 mm in diameter and up to 1 m
    deep. Bulk density was determined every 2 cm when the soil was compact, whereas
    in loose soils, such as the topsoil (0 – 20 cm) or those subsoil layers with sandy
    textures, a homogenized subsample was taken. SOC was determined by elemental analysis
    (FlashSmart Thermofisher). In addition, soil texture data was available every
    10 cm. See Table 1 for a detailed description of the soils. Download : Download

    model is process-oriented and cohort-structured, inspired by the marsh cohort
    model and Marsh Equilibrium Model (MEM) (Morris and Bowden, 1986; Morris et al.,
    2002), and specifically designed to assess the influence of biomass and sediment
    deposition in vertical accretion and SOC sequestration in rice fields. Soil accretion
    is driven by sediment inputs transported through irrigation channels and inputs
    of organic matter from crop biomass residues (straw and roots). The model developed
    simulates soil accretion from parent soils that existed before wetland conversion
    for rice production (ca. 100 years ago in the Ebro Delta). Three modules were
    developed –topsoil, subsoil and parent soil– which we attributed to different
    layers of soil accretion after wetland conversion (Fig. 2). The modules were developed
    based on effects of agricultural practices on soil structure and the inputs and
    outputs of organic and mineral matter specific to each layer, which influences
    the formation and transformation of cohorts within each module. In this way, external
    and internal inputs are identified and quantified. External inputs include sediment
    from the river (topMinei, j) and the residual biomass of the crop (topSOMi, j),
    which is added to the topsoil module. Internal inputs refer to the transfer of
    organic and mineral matter between the modules. Therefore, each cohort consists
    of a pool of soil organic matter (SOM) and mineral matter (Fig. 2). Download :

    of the crop soil accretion and cohort structure of the model. SOM: soil organic
    matter. 2.3.1. Dynamics of soil accretion Soil accretion is based on the gradual
    accumulation of organic and mineral matter in natural wetlands, as influenced
    by plowing of the topsoil, which disturbs the deposition order and homogenizes
    the topsoil. Accretion is reflected by the formation of new subsoil layers below
    the topsoil due to an increase in the depth of the topsoil (dZj) that exceeds
    the plowing depth. Thus, in each time step (j), a new subsoil cohort (i) is formed
    based on the balance of inputs of crop residues and sediments and outputs from
    decomposition (Table 2, Eq. 1). Table 2. Equations used to simulate biological

    Mineral matter bulk density. Cohort dimensions are defined dynamically by the
    inputs and outputs. The dimension is represented as a soil volume with a horizontal
    area of 1 cm2 times a variable depth. For topsoil, depth equals the plowing depth
    (1 cm2 × depth), which is determined by the depth to which the layer is homogenized.
    Subsoil depth varies and is determined by the annual change in depth of the topsoil
    (dZ) and the parent soil, whose depth is assumed to be infinite (Fig. 2). The
    contents of organic and mineral matter in topsoil and subsoil layers vary dynamically
    depending on dZj. If dZj exceeds 0, a new subsoil cohort will be created with
    a depth equal to dZj. The new subsoil cohort consists of organic and mineral portions
    (subSOMi, j, subMinei, j)), which contain proportional pools of the topsoil cohort
    (topSOM1, j and topMinei, j, respectively) (Table 2, Eq. 2). If the topsoil volume
    is less than the volume of the plowing depth (when input < output), the missing
    volume is taken from the subsoil cohort in order from shallowest to deepest, and
    may reach the parent soil, until the topsoil volume is filled to equal the volume
    of the plowing depth (Table 2, Eq. 3). 2.3.2. Soil organic matter decomposition
    For SOM decomposition, a single compartment of heterogeneous SOM decomposition
    was chosen, (Table 2, Eq. 4). Thus, the proportion of SOM that remains after one
    year is determined by a constant decomposition rate (k). For topsoil and subsoil
    cohorts, the range of k was set to represent different decomposition dynamics
    (and C stability), with higher rates for topsoil modules and lower rates for subsoil
    modules, based on differences in decomposition rates in agrosystems (Bayer et
    al., 2006), which vary as a function of soil properties and agricultural management
    (Rumpel and Kögel-Knabner, 2010; Six et al., 2002). The rates set for SOM decomposition
    were taken from the literature and ranged from 0.900 to 0.990 yr−1 (Koch and Stockfisch,
    2006) for the topsoil (k’1) and 0.990 – 0.999 yr−1 for the subsoil (k’2), assuming
    that increasing depth acts as a stabilization mechanism that decreases decomposition
    rates (Qin et al., 2019) (Table 3). Table 3. Summary of model parameters and values

    Yj [g cm-2]: Annual yield. 2.3.3. Organic matter input: crop yield and residue
    management Organic inputs in the form of crop residues (straw (Sj) and roots (Rj))
    are derived from the annual yield (Yj), the proportion of the straw remaining
    after one year of decomposition and the amount of straw incorporated in the soil.
    The range of Yj was based on reported yields (500 – 1000 g m-2) (Genua-Olmedo
    et al., 2022; Fabregat, 2006) but expanded to 100 – 1200 g m-2 to test model sensitivity.
    Annual straw incorporation was calculated from Yj by applying a harvest index
    (HI) of 0.5, which is the proportion of dry grain biomass in aboveground dry biomass
    from a previous study of Ebro Delta rice fields (Belenguer-Manzanedo et al., 2022).
    The straw remaining after one year of decomposition (ks) was set to 0.4 based
    on previous studies of rice straw decomposition rates in the Ebro Delta (Forès
    et al., 1988). In addition, straw management practices were represented by a straw
    incorporation factor (fs) (Table 2, Eq. 5). For the current study, two periods
    were distinguished based on past agri-environmental measures. Before 1990, because
    farmers decided how to manage straw, fs was set to a value from 0 to 1 to represent
    variability in management (i.e., burning, animal grazing or incorporation) (Table
    3). After 1990, because all straw remained in the field, ks was set to 1. For
    the amount of root biomass incorporated into the soil after one year (Rj), the
    proportion of root biomass was derived from the yield according to an agronomic
    index (root proportion (Rp)(Huang et al., 2007)) multiplied by the proportion
    of biomass that remains after one year of decomposition (kr) (Table 2, Eq. 6).
    Root proportion kr was assumed to equal 0.7 (Abiven et al., 2005; Lu et al., 2003).
    Since rice fields were created in different wetland habitats, the initial amount
    of SOM was set using field data to consider heterogeneity in SOM content. Based
    on data from Fennessy et al. (2019) for wetland soils in the Ebro Delta, within
    the range of the initial SOM content of the parent soil (1 – 30 %), the lowest
    SOM contents (1 – 7 %), which correspond to mineral soils, were related to converted
    marshes and riparian ecosystems, while higher SOM contents (15 – 30 %) were related
    to converted lagoon or peatland ecosystems. The organic fraction was estimated
    as loss on ignition (Table 2, Eq. 11). A conventional van Bemmelen factor of 1.724
    was applied assuming that organic matter contains 58 % of organic C. 2.3.4. Mineral
    input Mineral input (MIj) refers to the amount of sediment deposited each year
    in the field. MIj in Ebro Delta rice fields was assumed to be proportional to
    the suspended load carried by the river. The annual load deposited was obtained
    by dividing the Ebro River''s annual suspended load (Lj) by its annual runoff
    (Qj) (Table S1), obtained from the database of the Ebro River basin authority
    (CHE). It was then multiplied by a constant inflow rate to the field (q) which
    was set to 1.7 l s-1 based on previous observations (unpublished data) to obtain
    the mineral input per unit area in the rice field (Table 2, Eq. 7). In the past
    100 years, due to dam construction in the Ebro River basin, the suspended load
    and flow of the Ebro River have decreased greatly (Rovira et al., 2015). Consequently,
    two periods of suspended load were assessed: pre-dam (1914 – 1970), in which the
    suspended load progressively decreased, and post-dam (1971 – 2014), in which the
    suspended load remained low and constant (Fig. 3). The suspended load was set
    according to a linear regression for the pre-dam period and to a constant value
    for the post-dam period (Table 2, Eq. 8). Additionally, higher mineral inputs
    were tested for MIc (Table 2) to consider other sediment requirements (e.g., to
    compensate for SLR and simulated future scenarios of sediment recovery through
    sediment bypass in the reservoirs (Genua-Olmedo et al., 2022; Rovira and Ibàñez,
    2007)). Download : Download high-res image (451KB) Download : Download full-size

    regression for the period before dam construction. 2.4. Model predictions 2.4.1.
    Soil organic carbon stock The SOC stock was predicted separately for the topsoil
    and each subsoil layer (Table 2, Eq. 9). To this end, bulk density was calculated
    using the mixing model of Morris et al. (2016) (Table 2, Eq. 10). The bulk densities
    of organic (δ1) and mineral matter (δ2) measured in marsh soils of the coastal
    United States (0.085 and 1.99 g cm-3, respectively) were used to estimate the
    organic fraction as loss on ignition (Table 2, Eq. 11). As before, a conventional
    van Bemmelen factor of 1.724 was applied. Comparison between predicted and observed
    SOC stocks was restricted to a depth of 50 cm. If predicted accretion was less
    than 50 cm, i.e., total depth of the topsoil and the increment of each subsoil
    layer (dZ), the missing volume was filled using the volume taken from the parent
    soil (initialized at the beginning of the simulation). 2.4.2. Vertical accretion
    Vertical accretion equaled the sum of the organic and mineral volumes of each
    module minus the volume taken from the parent soil when dZ < 0. The annual accretion
    rate equaled the total volume divided by the number of time steps (i.e., 100 in
    this study). 2.5. Model calibration and evaluation The model was calibrated using
    simulations that combined six input parameters whose values were selected according
    to the available bibliography and our own data (Table 3). The model was then evaluated
    based on comparing observed and predicted SOM profiles. Performance was assessed
    in two steps. First, observed and simulated SOC profiles for each field were compared.
    Simulations were selected when the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) between
    observed and predicted SOC profiles exceeded 0.69 and the slope of the regression
    between them ranged from 0.85 to 1.15. Second, the degree of support for each
    candidate simulation was determined using the second-order Akaike Information
    Criterion (AICc). AICc was then rescaled for each field (i.e. soil core) by selecting
    the simulations with ΔAICc ≤ 4 (Burnham et al., 2011). Finally, the input parameters
    that yielded the most accurate predictions of the observed SOC profile for each
    core were compared according to physical-chemical and biogeographical properties.
    The sensitivity of model predictions was analyzed for representative simulations
    of rice field establishment in the Ebro Delta. Vertical accretion, annual accretion
    rate, change in SOC content in the topsoil and final SOC stock were evaluated
    by combining the parameters k’1, initial SOM and mineral input. 2.6. Scenario
    projection: changes in grain yield, decomposition rate and mineral input as a
    function of initial SOM content Crop yield, the topsoil organic matter decomposition
    rate, mineral input and initial SOM content were combined to simulate possible
    effects of climate change, such as changes in soil respiration or soil salinization,
    which influence both decomposition rates and rice productivity. Rice-yield scenarios
    were set to 600 – 800 g m-2 to represent current yields and 200 – 400 kg m-2 to
    represent 50 % losses in order to represent effects of factors that threaten production,
    such as higher soil salinity due to SLR (Genua-Olmedo et al., 2016). For the topsoil
    organic matter decomposition rate, low and high decomposition scenarios were represented
    by setting k’1 to 0.95 – 0.99 or 0.90 – 0.95, respectively, the latter to simulate
    increases in temperature that are expected to increase SOM decomposition (Kirschbaum,
    1995). Finally, differences in mineral input were simulated in four scenarios
    –very low (i.e., current input), low, moderate and high (0.01, 0.1 – 0.2, 0.3
    – 0.4 and 0.5 – 0.6 g cm-2, respectively)– to simulate partial restoration of
    sediment transport (suspended load) by implementing sediment bypass systems in
    the lower Ebro River reservoirs (Rovira and Ibáñez, 2007). All scenarios were
    run for 100 years starting with an initial SOM content of 3 %, 6 %, 9 % or 12
    % to represent the SOM contents of current rice paddies. The baseline scenario
    is set as 0.01 g cm-2 mineral inputs and 600 – 800 g m-2 of crop production combined
    with all decomposition and initial SOM values. 3. Results 3.1. Model evaluation
    A total of 7,900 out of 110,250 simulations met the selection conditions between
    predicted and observed SOC content A total of 928 simulations were selected as
    very likely (ΔAICc < 4), of which 798 corresponded to profile L1, and 6–64 corresponded
    to each of the remaining profiles (Table 4). Prediction accuracy was higher for
    soil profiles R1, R2, M1 and S1 than for profiles P1, L1, M2 and S2 (Table 4).
    The selected simulations showed a narrow range for each of the six input parameters,
    except for the subsoil decomposition rate (Table 4). In this sense, initial SOM
    matter was low (1 % and 4 %) for profiles with more mineral parent soils, such
    riparian (R1, and R2) and saltmarsh (S1) habitats (Table 1), and ranged from 4
    to 22 % in the well-predicted M1 profile (salt meadow). For profiles with lower
    accuracy (i.e., higher ΔAICc), such as organic-rich soils of P1 (peatland), L1
    (lagoon) and M2 (salt meadow) (Table 4), the initial SOM contents selected showed
    a wider range and higher values, from 7, 1 and 4 % of initial SOM, respectively,
    up to 30 %. Table 4. Model calibration results, selected input parameters and

    13.44 k’1 [proportion]: SOM fraction that remains annually in topsoil; k’2 [proportion]:
    SOM fraction that remains annually in subsoil; SOC: soil organic carbon. The mineral
    inputs content selected for the post-dam construction period were the most accurate
    for profiles S1, S2 and R1, set to 0.01 g cm-2 which coincides with current estimated
    mineral input (Table 4; Fig. 3). For field M1, the mineral input was higher (0.5
    – 0.6 g cm-2), while P1, M2, L1 and R2 showed a wider range, with intermediate
    mineral inputs (0.01 – 0.4 g cm-2), all of them related to higher SOM content
    in the field. The range of topsoil decomposition rate varied among fields (with
    an unclear relation to the other modeled parameters) but did not differ (0.990
    – 0.999) among subsoil decomposition rate profiles (Table 4). Crop yield ranged
    mainly from 600 to 1200 g m-2 (current range), and only P1 had a narrower range
    (100 – 400 g m-2). The straw incorporation fraction also showed field-specific
    ranges: R1, R2, S1 and S2 varied from 0.6 to 1, M1 and P1 from 0.2 to 0.6, and
    L1 and M2 showed the full range (i.e., 0 – 1). 3.2. Predicted SOC stocks and vertical
    accretion Predicted SOC stocks for all profiles ranged 5 – 18 kg m-2 (Table 4)
    and tended to be slightly underpredicted, except for that of S2, which was overpredicted
    (Fig. 4). Accuracy of predicted SOC stock differed between the topsoil vs. subsoil,
    being higher for the subsoil for R1, R2, M2, S1 and P1. Among subsoil layers,
    SOC stock was underpredicted for M1, but overpredicted for S2 and L1. Predicted
    SOC stock in the topsoil was the most accurate in profiles R2, S2 and L1. SOC
    stock was underpredicted to a similar degree for topsoil profiles R1, S1, R2,
    L1 and S2, while predicted SOC stocks for M1, M2 and P1 were one-third to one-half
    observed SOC stocks (Fig. 4). Download : Download high-res image (358KB) Download

    range. Predicted vertical accretion rates for the past 100 years ranged from 1.4
    to 6.8 mm yr-1 (Table 4), with a mean of 3.4 mm yr-1. Both mineral-dominated (R1,
    R2, S1) and soils with higher mineral input (M1, L1) had more vertical accretion.
    Soils with initial SOM content of 1 – 4 % had 43 – 57 cm of vertical accretion,
    while soils with initial SOM content > 7 % had 34 – 47 cm (Table 4). 3.3. Sensitivity
    analysis of SOC stocks and vertical accretion Changes in organic and mineral matter
    inputs due to sediment reduction and straw incorporation influenced the accretion
    rate and total SOC content of soil profiles (Fig. 5A and E). The SOM decomposition
    rate in the topsoil (k’1) was the variable that influenced vertical accretion
    and total SOC stock the most (Fig. 5A, B and E). Vertical accretion ranged from
    30 to 45 cm and 45 – 60 for k’1 = 0.90 and 0.99, respectively, in 100-year simulations
    (Fig. 5A and B). The accretion rate also decreased as the initial SOM content
    in the parent soil increased (Fig. 5C). Download : Download high-res image (431KB)

    for k''1 = 0.99. Light and dark colors represent initial soil organic matter of
    1 % and 10 %, respectively. Dashed lines are for post-dam-period mineral input
    = 0.01 g cm-2, solid lines for mineral input = 0.3 g cm-2. In the simulations,
    during the pre-dam period (1914 – 1970), when several dams were built in the upper
    and middle parts of the basin, accretion rate clearly decreased following the
    progressive reduction in mineral inputs (Fig. 5C). During the post-dam period
    (1970 – 2014), when three large dams were built in the lower Ebro River, the drastic
    reduction in sediment input (ca. 0.01 g yr-1) prevented soil accretion. However,
    the generalization of straw incorporation after 1990 promoted an increase in accretion
    rate of ca. 0.1 cm yr-1, which was also influenced by the SOM decomposition rate
    (Fig. 5C). The C content in the entire profile and the final SOC stock (Fig. 5E)
    were influenced by the decomposition rate: decreasing k’1 from 0.99 to 0.90 increased
    SOC sequestration by 3.5 and 5.0 times for mineral inputs of 0.01 and 0.3, respectively.
    For k’1 = 0.99, SOC stock differences were positively influenced by initial C
    content, thus SOC stock was higher in more organic soils, regardless of mineral
    input. However, for k’1 = 0.90 (i.e. higher decomposition rate), final SOC stock
    was higher in soils with lower initial SOM content but higher mineral input (Fig.
    5). The amount of SOC in the topsoil decreased rapidly as initial SOM content
    increased and until the input of organic and mineral matter equaled their output
    (Fig. 5D). In addition, in soils with low initial SOM content, SOC dynamics depended
    on the decomposition rate. For k’1 = 0.90, SOC content decreased until equilibrium,
    whereas for k’1 = 0.99, SOC content increased. The increase in organic matter
    input due to straw incorporation gradually increased topsoil SOC content. Finally,
    a decrease in mineral input from 0.3 to 0.01 during the post-dam period decreased
    SOC content in the topsoil, although in both cases a gradual increase was predicted
    over the last 40 years (Fig. 5D). 3.4. Vertical accretion and SOC stock projections
    under different management scenarios In the baseline scenario (i.e., 0.01 g cm-2
    mineral inputs and 600 – 800 g m-2 of crop production), vertical accretion was
    positive in mineral soils with low decomposition rates, but the change in elevation
    was lower (even becoming negative) in scenarios with high decomposition rates
    and more organic soils (Fig. 6A). Increasing mineral input from 0.01 g cm-2 (i.e.,
    post-dam period) to 0.5 – 0.6 g cm-2 (i.e., pre-dam period or future restoration
    of sediment transport in the river), predictions changed from a mean decrease
    in elevation (-0.69 ± 1.3 mm yr-1) to vertical accretion (3.16 ± 0.81 mm yr-1).
    High decomposition rates resulted in accretion rates that were one-fifth as high
    under steady yields and one-third as high with a 50 % yield loss. Under the scenario
    of 50 % yield loss, the mean accretion rate was 0.19 ± 1.76 mm yr-1, one-sixth
    that under current crop yields, regardless of the decomposition rate. Download

    Mean model predictions for vertical accretion and soil organic carbon (SOC) stock
    after 100 years under different conditions of initial soil organic matter (SOM),
    mineral input, crop yield and topsoil organic carbon decomposition rate (k’1).
    Graphs are arranged vertically by lowest to highest mineral input: very low (0.01
    g cm-2), low (0.1 – 0.2 g cm-2), moderate (0.3 – 0.4 g cm-2) and high (0.5 – 0.6
    g cm-2). Graphs are divided horizontally by crop yield (steady (600 – 800 g m-2)
    vs. loss (200 – 400 g m-2) and again by k’1 (low (0.95 – 0.99) vs. high (0.90
    – 0.95)). Asterisks indicate no increase in SOC stock. Error bars are the standard
    error. Under current conditions of mineral input, SOC stock would increase if
    current crop yields are maintained and decomposition rates are low. Regardless
    of the mineral input, the model predicted a mean SOC stock of 10.9 ± 1.2 kg m-2
    with a lower decomposition rate and steady yields, but 4.6 ± 0.6 and 5.0 ± 0.4
    kg C m-2 with a high decomposition rate or 50 % yield loss, respectively. In the
    worst-case scenario (50 % yield loss and high decomposition rate), SOC stocks
    were predicted to increase only at higher accretion rates averaging 1.91 ± 0.26
    kg SOC m-2. 4. Discussion 4.1. Model fitness and limitations The model was calibrated
    to cover the spatial and temporal variability of the Ebro Delta rice field landscape
    considering 1) different initial SOM contents, related to the natural habitat
    before rice field establishment; 2) the decrease in sediment deposition transported
    by irrigation channels, caused by dam construction; 3) different rates of SOM
    decomposition and 4) differences in organic matter input, related to yields and
    agricultural management (straw incorporation). One novel feature of the model
    is the redistribution of organic and mineral matter in the soil profile due to
    plowing. Plowing influences not only the topsoil but can also expose subsoil C,
    which redistributes SOM profile (Baker et al., 2007; Olson and Al-Kaisi, 2015).
    Soils with higher SOM content are more sensitive to exposure of subsoil C by plowing
    due to subsidence by compaction of the soil. Subsidence in rice fields occurs
    the most in peatland-derived soils (Hoogland et al., 2012; Knotters et al., 2022).
    In this sense, the initial SOM content is important since it influences the vertical
    accretion rate and SOC stock. Thus, initial SOM content is related to the productivity
    and soil properties of the habitats that were converted into rice fields; thus,
    SOM content is higher in rice fields converted from peatlands, salt meadows and
    coastal lagoons, and lower in those converted from riparian vegetation and salt
    marshes (Fennessy et al., 2019; Morant et al., 2020). During model calibration,
    the initial SOM contents selected for the parent soils were consistent with the
    pre-existing reclaimed ecosystems, with lower contents selected for rice fields
    close to the river and in marshes (R1, R2 and S1) than for those in grasslands,
    coastal lagoons or peatlands (M2, L1 and P1). The accuracy of predicted SOM profiles
    was higher for soils with lower SOM content and a clay texture than for soils
    with a higher SOM or sand content. In organic-rich soils such as P1, M1 and M2,
    total SOC stocks were underpredicted, but most of the differences were due to
    predictions of the topsoil in contrast, total SOC stocks in sandy subsoils such
    as S2 and L1 were greatly overpredicted. These differences in model accuracy appear
    to be due to oversimplified modeling of the organic fraction, which would decrease
    the model''s accuracy in predicting the SOC stock. Many factors such as particle
    size, nitrogen availability, soil moisture, temperature and SOM composition are
    normally included in SOC models that simulate biogeochemical C cycles, since they
    mediate both fresh organic matter inputs and SOM decomposition (see DNDC, CENTURY
    or Roth-C (Coleman and Jenkinson, 1996; Li, 1996; Parton et al., 1998)). These
    factors are related to SOM stabilization mechanisms such as the formation of micro-
    and macro-aggregates and organo-mineral associations that protect against bacterial
    decomposition (Cotrufo et al., 2019, 2013; Kallenbach et al., 2016; Six et al.,
    2004). Physical-chemical properties of organic soils favor the formation of micro-aggregates
    and organo-mineral associations, in which the presence of clay is associated with
    greater SOC recalcitrance (Kallenbach et al., 2016), which would explain the underprediction
    of SOC stocks in clay and peatland-derived soils. In this sense, sand and clay
    content may determine SOM decomposition rates (Angst et al., 2021). In comparison,
    we also attribute the overpredicted SOC stocks in sandy soils to oversimplification
    of the processes involved in C stabilization. In this case, sandy soils generally
    have a lower capacity for C stabilization due to the mineral properties of sand
    and the more porous soil structure, which provides less protection of SOM and
    easier leaching of organo-mineral colloids (Six et al., 2002; Zhang and He, 2004).
    Specifically for the Ebro Delta, soil texture is one of the factors influenced
    by the amount of organic matter in the entire profile and should be included in
    future versions of the model. The other novel feature of the model is the consideration
    of sediment input, which influences vertical accretion and SOC dynamics in rice
    fields. Predictions of total vertical accretion, which included inputs of organic
    matter (influenced by decomposition rates) and mineral matter, ranged from 1.4
    to 6.8 mm yr-1, which lie in the range of 2.5 – 4.1 mm yr-1 reported by Ibáñez
    et al. (1997). This accretion considers changes in sediment transport during the
    period of paddy rice expansion in the Ebro Delta. The progressive reduction in
    the suspended load of the river due to the construction of dams in the river basin
    marked the decrease in the annual accretion rate predicted by the model throughout
    the pre-dam period (Fig. 5C). Likewise, natural wetlands of the Ebro Delta have
    also shown higher accretion in the medium term than in the short term, which is
    attributed to the construction of the dams (Fennessy et al., 2019). In addition,
    Ibáñez et al. (1997) estimated accretion rates of 4.7 – 7.4 mm yr-1 before dam
    construction and -0.2 mm yr-1 after dam construction based on suspended mineral
    load in rice-field drainage channels. In this sense, another limitation of the
    model is that it does not represent sediment outflows from the fields. This implies
    that the predicted accretion rates were slightly overpredicted, but they still
    lay within observed ranges. During model evaluation, mineral input during the
    post-dam period in rice fields from riparian and salt marsh habitats was set to
    the current estimated mineral input (0.01 g l-1 yr-1), due to their lower SOM
    content, while in fields with higher SOM content (M1, M2, P1, L1 and R2), it was
    set to larger values (0.1 – 0.6 g l-1 yr-1). Higher input of mineral matter into
    rice field soils with higher SOM content is explained in part by inputs of sediment
    to rice fields by some farmers to compensate for subsidence, avoid saline intrusion
    and facilitate agricultural work. In this context, soils with higher SOM content
    are more sensitive to subsidence or salinization; thus, farmers are likely to
    add sediment directly after insufficient arrival of sediment from the river, which
    justifies the larger values of mineral input selected. In contrast, more mineral
    or elevated soils, such as those derived from marshes (S1, S2) and close to the
    river (R1), do not have these problems (saline intrusion or swampy fields); thus,
    the sediment input comes only from irrigation and equals estimates based on suspended
    load in the river. 4.2. Soil accretion in rice fields The sensitivity analysis
    under Ebro Delta conditions (i.e., sediment reduction, spatial heterogeneity and
    straw incorporation) showed that parameters related to SOM strongly influenced
    the predicted accretion and final SOC sequestration rates. The decomposition rate
    was the main factor that influenced SOC content and accretion rate. The increase
    in the decomposition rate decreased accretion and SOC sequestration, but the initial
    SOM content influenced this effect. Total accretion after SOM decomposition was
    lower in soils with higher SOM content, since the SOM occupies more volume in
    the soil matrix than mineral matter (Morris et al., 2016; Neubauer, 2008). In
    this sense, crop management has been identified as key process to decrease SOM
    decomposition, which causes C loss and subsidence (Hatala et al., 2012; Knox et
    al., 2015). Thus, control of SOM decomposition in agricultural soils, which is
    determined largely by crop management, may strongly influence soil accretion (Bai
    et al., 2019). Increasing organic matter input by incorporating all crop residues
    can increase annual accretion rates; however, maintaining the accretion rate will
    depend on the stability of the newly incorporated organic matter and SOM (i.e.,
    reducing decomposition rates). Incorporating residues (i.e., organic matter) into
    cropland soils has not been reported to promote soil accretion, but it does promote
    adaptation to SLR, as is the case for organic matter production and accumulation
    in marshes that bears most of the accretion (Calvo-Cubero et al., 2013; Neubauer,
    2008). In addition, sediments help stabilize SOM (Neubauer, 2008). Given the similarity
    of accretion mechanisms in natural wetlands and rice fields, minimizing the decomposition
    of incorporated crop residues, along with the sediments input, would promote vertical
    accretion and SOC sequestration. Comparing soil formation in rice fields and natural
    wetlands of the Ebro Delta, observed vertical accretion is similar in both: 3.3
    ± 1.1 mm yr-1 in rice fields vs. 4.8 ± 3.2 and 3.0 ± 2.2 mm yr-1 in brackish and
    saline wetlands, respectively (Fennessy et al., 2019). SOC sequestration rates
    in the Ebro Delta range from 204 ± 104 to 207 ± 183 g C m-2 yr-1 for brackish
    and saline wetlands (Fennessy et al., 2019), respectively, but have been lower
    compared to our estimations in rice fields over the past century (103.5 ± 33.3
    g C m-2 yr-1). The lower SOC sequestration in rice fields than in wetlands could
    be attributed to crop management, since rice fields have primary productivity
    (851 – 968 g m-2 yr-1; calculated from Belenguer-Manzanedo et al. (2022)) similar
    to the mean primary productivity for brackish and saline wetlands (981 g m-2 yr-1;
    Curcó et al., 2002). This relative similarity between rice fields and wetlands
    suggests that sediment inputs to rice fields strongly influence vertical accretion
    and thus resilience in adapting to SLR across the delta. Thus, soil accretion
    through the organic matter accumulation and sediment input of rice cultivation
    could be proposed as an ecosystem service provided by lowland rice fields considered
    as semi-natural wetlands (Chivenge et al., 2020; Natuhara, 2013). 4.3. Implications
    for adaptation to climate change Climate change is expected to influence C sequestration
    in terrestrial ecosystems (Bai et al., 2019). Under current conditions, the predicted
    annual vertical accretion rate in the Ebro Delta rice fields was 2 mm yr-1; thus,
    predicted SOC sequestration would be ca. 60 – 120 g C m-2 yr-1, which lies within
    the range of the rates observed in California rice fields (84 – 283 g C m-2 yr-1;
    Hatala et al., 2012) and in the Ebro Delta (109 – 197 g C m-2 yr-1; Belenguer-Manzanedo
    et al., 2022). Rising temperatures are expected to increase soil respiration,
    which will increase loss of SOC and reduce the capacity for SOC sequestration
    (Crowther et al., 2016). Considering scenarios of a loss of 5 – 10 % of SOM per
    year, simulations predicted that SOC sequestration tends to zero under the baseline
    scenario of very low mineral input (Fig. 6). Regarding SLR effects, the current
    accretion rate (2 mm yr-1) would not compensate for the relative SLR of 7 mm yr-1
    that is occurring in the Ebro Delta (Ibáñez et al., 2010). Consequently, soil
    salinity is expected to increase and cause rice yields to decrease (Genua-Olmedo
    et al., 2016). In this context, the model predicted that crop yield reductions
    of up to 50 % would result in no soil SOC sequestration in rice fields (Fig. 6).
    Therefore, it is crucial to increase sediment input to rice fields to ensure enough
    vertical accretion to avoid loss of production due to soil salinization and thereby
    ensure SOC sequestration capacity. Besides increasing rice productivity, incorporating
    all crop residues and implementing measures to reduce SOM decomposition would
    support positive accretion rates and be in line with proposed measures to increase
    SOC sequestration (Lychuk et al., 2021; Pareek, 2017). Predictions of this model
    indicate that mineral inputs would need to be restored to ensure SOC sequestration
    in the future. To cope with low sediment input, implementation of sediment bypass
    systems has been proposed in the lower Ebro reservoirs (Rovira and Ibàñez, 2007).
    In the Ebro Delta, cost estimates of flushing sediments downriver to counteract
    SLR range from 0.73 to 2.5 million € per year (Genua-Olmedo et al., 2022). In
    this sense, it may be advisable to prioritize sediment input in fields that have
    lower elevation and are more vulnerable to loss of SOC sequestration capacity,
    such as those closer to the coast and/or those with more organic soils, since
    the latter especially have lower predicted accretion rates and are more vulnerable
    to loss of SOC sequestration capacity (Fig. 6). In addition, restoring wetland
    habitats in the most vulnerable rice fields could be an effective measure to promote
    SOC sequestration and address SLR, since it has been shown that accretion in rice
    fields transformed back into wetlands can be as high as 1 cm yr-1, mainly due
    to accumulation of organic matter after establishment of plant communities (Calvo-Cubero
    et al., 2013). Therefore, due to the heterogeneity of the Ebro Delta landscape,
    application of management measures would be advisable with field-specific planning,
    for instance considering a field''s SOM content, soil physical-chemical properties
    and elevation. 5. Conclusions A soil accretion model that predicts vertical accretion
    and SOC sequestration in rice paddies as a function of sediment deposition and
    crop production was developed to assess future impacts that threaten rice cultivation
    in deltas. Model predictions were more accurate for rice fields with low SOM content,
    suggesting that the model should be improved to better simulate soil dynamics
    in rice fields with higher SOM content and a sandier texture. We related inaccuracies
    to oversimplified SOC dynamics and suggest representing SOC-stabilization processes
    in more detail in future versions. To maintain rice-crop viability and SOC sequestration,
    crop management should adopt measures that simultaneously promote further stabilization
    and accumulation of organic matter and restore sediment inputs. Based on simulated
    projections of future sediment input after restoring sediment transport in the
    river, future rice-yield scenarios impacted by SLR and SOM losses due to rising
    temperatures suggest that restoring sediment inputs is key in the Ebro Delta system
    to promote SOC sequestration. Funding This study was supported by the Spanish

    Irrigated croplands are expanding, and irrigation water demand is increasing.

    article in issue 1. Introduction Irrigation has a critical role in global food
    security. It helps farmers achieve higher crop yields to meet increasing food
    demand. It also makes agricultural products more resilient against the adverse
    impacts of climate change and variability. The demand for irrigation water is
    constantly rising (Wada et al., 2011) and is projected to increase even further
    because of climate change-related alterations in rainfall patterns and the frequency
    of prolonged droughts (Puy et al., 2020). The need for irrigated agriculture to
    meet the growing demand for food threatens global food and water security. For
    example, although irrigation is practiced in only one-fourth of global cropped
    areas, 40 % of global agricultural products are grown in irrigated fields (Siebert
    & Döll, 2010), consuming approximately 70 % of the global gross water demand (Döll
    et al., 2009). Although irrigation is widely applied worldwide, quantifying the
    amount and value of irrigation water is challenging. The information gap in irrigation
    water usage and its productivity hinders effective water resource management,
    sustainable agricultural practices, and informed policy decisions. Without accurate
    and timely information on the amount of water used for irrigation, it is difficult
    to identify areas where water conservation measures are required, allocate water
    resources efficiently, or develop policies to promote sustainable agricultural
    practices. Reliable estimates of irrigation water usage and valuing the water
    used in irrigation, based on the crop productivity per unit of irrigation water
    use, are critical steps toward achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development
    Goal 6: ensuring access to water and sanitation for all by 2030 (Schmidt, 2019).
    Closing the information gap on irrigation water quantity and value is crucial
    for addressing global challenges, such as water scarcity, food insecurity, and
    environmental degradation, leading to better decision-making strategies. Knowing
    the value of water for a given crop type and region may help decision-makers regionalize
    crop species and variants to minimize irrigation costs while maximizing crop yield
    and profit and potentially reducing the environmental consequences of irrigation.
    Recent advances in global irrigation measurement techniques, such as passive microwave
    sensors that retrieve soil moisture data, have provided new data that can help
    close the information gap referenced above. These techniques, along with machine
    learning approaches, represent the first step toward the sustainable development
    of water resources, as outlined by Garrick et al. (2017). The next necessary step
    is the quantification of the value of irrigation water used, which is needed for
    promoting and achieving the efficient global use of water resources (Schmidt,
    2019). The valuation of water resources helps us understand the efficiency of
    irrigation and prevent water overconsumption in specific crop types, climate conditions,
    and environmental settings. Assigning a value to water is difficult due to the
    lack of an open market. Previous studies have shown that irrigation water can
    be valued by comparing the increased volume of agricultural products in irrigated
    areas to rain-fed conditions (D’Odorico et al., 2020). Doing this requires estimates
    of the amount of irrigation water used and agroecosystem modeling tools to estimate
    the volume of additional crop yield in response to additional irrigation. The
    global distribution of irrigation has been estimated using various approaches,
    including remote sensing techniques, modeling, and data collection methods. An
    example of the latter is the Food and Agriculture Organization’s (FAO) AQUASTAT
    approach, which combines data collection efforts from censuses, questionnaires,
    literature reviews, and country surveys (FAO, 2022). Remote sensing techniques
    have evolved rapidly owing to their extensive coverage, high spatiotemporal resolution,
    observation-based nature, and timely provision of data. The identification of
    irrigated areas using remote sensing dates to the late 70s using visual interpretations
    of the red and NIR bands of Landsat images (Draeger, 1976, Heller and Johnson,
    1979). More recent methods employ thermal and optical sensors, indirectly estimating
    irrigation by observing increased transpiration due to enhanced plant water consumption.
    Crop coefficients derived from satellite-based vegetation indices and energy balance
    calculations, used to estimate actual evapotranspiration, can be correlated with
    irrigation (Allen et al., 2007, Filippelli et al., 2022). However, it''s important
    to recognize that transpiration accounts for only a portion of actual irrigation
    quantities, ignoring the other water losses like drainage, soil moisture retention,
    and runoff. Multifaceted approaches to identify irrigated areas at various scales
    are also available. Such approaches leverage multiple predictors such as vegetation
    indices, meteorological data, diverse microwave sensors, and data processing tools,
    including machine learning classification and data assimilation (Karthikeyan et
    al., 2020, Ozdogan et al., 2010). For example, in addition to methods comprising
    multiple optical and thermal infrared sensors (Thenkabail et al., 2009), microwave
    sensors, especially from NASA’s Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission, have
    been used to identify irrigated areas globally (Lawston et al., 2017). Quantifying
    the amount of irrigation water using remote sensing is a challenging task. The
    main hurdles include the lack of ground-truth information on the quantity of irrigated
    water, except for very limited spatial and temporal scales, uncertainties associated
    with the assumptions needed for algorithms, and obtaining the necessary information
    from the available sensors. Except for highly controlled farm-scale areas over
    limited time periods, ground-based data on the quantity of irrigation water does
    not exist because of technical hardships and high monitoring equipment deployment
    costs (Brocca et al., 2018). To circumvent this limitation, many previous studies
    estimate Irrigation Water Requirements (IWR), the difference between effective
    precipitation and crop water requirements, instead of using actual irrigation
    amounts (Chapagain et al., 2006, Van Dijk et al., 2018; Petra Döll and Siebert,
    2002, Hanasaki et al., 2010, Wada et al., 2014). The IWR method requires knowledge
    of the potential evapotranspiration of vegetation free from any water stress and
    incoming rainfall amounts for a given region. Both are prone to uncertainty. Moreover,
    once the IWR is estimated, these studies assume that an appropriate amount of
    irrigation is applied. However, most croplands are inefficiently irrigated, meaning
    that over- or under-irrigation is often applied. More information on remote sensing
    applications and the IWR approach can be found in (Calera et al., 2017, Karthikeyan
    et al., 2020), among others. Over the past decade, the retrieval of soil moisture
    data from microwave sensors has proven instrumental in the detection and quantification
    of irrigation (Abolafia-Rosenzweig et al., 2019, Brocca et al., 2018, Jalilvand
    et al., 2021, Lawston et al., 2017, Zaussinger et al., 2019). Remote monitoring
    of soil moisture can provide information on the quantity and timing of irrigation
    in the absence of rainfall. Active sensors using the C-band Synthetic Aperture
    Radar (SAR), such as Sentinel constellations, have been used to estimate irrigation
    timing and amounts based on their sensitivity to soil moisture and vegetation
    water content (Gao et al., 2018, Hamze et al., 2023, Le Page et al., 2023). Despite
    the high spatial resolution of Sentinel data, challenges arise due to its coarse
    revisit time, limited spatial coverage, and the C-band''s restricted penetration
    depth, making accurate irrigation quantification analyses a complex task. Passive
    sensors operating in the L-band microwave range, such as SMAP, offer a valuable
    alternative by measuring soil moisture in the top soil layers, providing an additional
    means to quantify irrigation practices. Brocca et al. (2018) demonstrated the
    utility of remotely sensed soil moisture in a water balance equation, enabling
    the back-calculation of monthly irrigation amounts during non-rainy satellite
    overpasses. Abolafia-Rosenzweig et al. (2019) employed a soil moisture data assimilation
    method in a synthetic experiment to estimate irrigation quantities. Similarly,
    Jalilvand et al. (2023) used a data assimilation method to assimilate downscaled
    SMAP soil moisture observations into a land surface model to quantify irrigation
    use. Both of these methods exhibited promising results. However, it''s important
    to note that the accuracy of these data assimilation studies relies on prior knowledge
    of irrigation timing. Obtaining such information is challenging, given the complexities
    surrounding the estimation of farmers'' decisions regarding irrigation scheduling
    (United States Department of Agriculture, 2019). Prior research has demonstrated
    the feasibility of detecting and quantifying irrigation practices through SMAP
    soil moisture retrievals when synergistically used with other methods such as
    land surface models, data assimilation, and water balance approaches. Nevertheless,
    challenges persist, primarily rooted in the poor parameterization of soil and
    crop characteristics, as well as the coarse resolution of satellite data that
    fails to represent agricultural fields realistically. These limitations have resulted
    in inaccuracies in estimating irrigation quantities (Puy et al., 2022). To advance
    our understanding and application of these methods, there is a need to extend
    their applicability across diverse climatic, soil, and land cover settings worldwide,
    which can help refine our ability to detect and quantify irrigation practices
    with greater precision and reliability. To advance our understanding and application
    of these methods, there is a need to extend their applicability across diverse
    climatic, soil, and land cover settings worldwide, which can help refine our ability
    to detect and quantify irrigation practices with greater precision and reliability.
    This study aims to address the following research questions: 1) How can irrigation
    be quantified based on SMAP observations? 2) How does irrigation alter the water
    and carbon balances in water- and energy-limited environments? 3) How effectively
    is irrigation water converted into crop productivity, and what is the relative
    value of irrigation in water- and energy-limited regions? To address these questions,
    we use SMAP soil moisture observations and a bucket-type hydrology model to quantify
    the water used for irrigation during the growing season. The irrigation amounts
    on two AmeriFlux sites (a water-limited site in Central Valley, California, and
    an energy-limited site in Eugene, Oregon) in the western US were estimated, and
    then the irrigation quantities were transferred to a more sophisticated, physically
    based ecosystem model to simulate water, carbon, and energy flux changes caused
    by irrigation in the two study sites. Estimating additional plant productivity
    resulting from irrigation allows us to compare the net value of used water in
    these regions in terms of increases in net primary productivity. In the following
    section, we describe the bucket-type hydrology and ecosystem models used in the
    analyses and the field sites, model inputs, and parameterizations. Then, we detail
    our irrigation estimation approach and present our findings using the bucket model.
    In Section 4, we compare the ecosystem model results with the available eddy covariance
    flux tower data. Finally, we present our estimations of the value of water used
    in a water-limited region and an energy-limited region in Section 5, followed
    by a discussion and conclusions in the final section. 2. Models and data In this
    study, two hydrological models of different complexities were used. A simplistic
    first model is a vertically lumped, zero-dimensional, bucket-type hydrological
    model. It is used to quantify irrigation amounts based on SMAP observations. A
    more sophisticated second model, AgroIBIS-VSF, is an ecosystem simulator used
    to estimate plant productivity that can be attributed to given irrigation amounts.
    The descriptions for both models are presented in the following sections. 2.1.
    Bucket type hydrology model The soil moisture balance within a root zone at a
    point in the bucket-type model is expressed by the mass balance equation (Eagleson,
    1982, Istanbulluoglu et al., 2012, Laio et al., 2001) where n is porosity [-],
    Zr is the rooting depth [L], s is the saturation degree (volumetric water content
    normalized by the porosity) [-], t is time [T], Ia is infiltration rate [LT−1],
    ETa is actual evapotranspiration rate [LT−1], and D is drainage rate [LT−1]. The
    infiltration rate is determined by the soil infiltration capacity and the rainfall
    rate. Once soil saturation is reached, the infiltration rate is reduced to the
    rate of drainage as: where Pr is the rainfall rate [LT−1], Pt is the total cumulative
    rainfall [L] for a given rain event, Ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity,
    and Ci is the canopy interception [L]. When the rainfall rate exceeds hydraulic
    conductivity, and the canopy cannot intercept more rainfall, then runoff is generated.
    Actual evapotranspiration is calculated by reducing the potential evapotranspiration
    (ETp, a model input) in proportion to the relative soil saturation: where sw,
    sh, and s* are the saturation degrees at wilting point, soil hygroscopic capacity,
    and incipient stomatal closure, respectively. The drainage rate is calculated
    under the assumption that the unit hydraulic gradient is applied to the lower
    boundary with uniform soil hydraulic parameters across the rooting zone: where
    sfc is the soil saturation degree at field capacity, K(s) is the unsaturated hydraulic
    conductivity [LT−1], Ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity [LT−1], and b
    is an empirical parameter in the Campbell soil moisture retention model (Campbell,
    1974). 2.2. Ecosystem model AgroIBIS-VSF is an ecosystem model used to estimate
    plant productivity resulting from irrigation (Soylu et al., 2014). AgroIBIS-VSF
    is an integrated model that captures the capabilities of both Agro-IBIS and Hydrus-1D
    models. It is a process-based agroecosystem model capable of simulating ecosystem
    dynamics with coupled carbon, water, and energy cycles under variably saturated
    soil conditions. Agro-IBIS simulates leaf-level processes such as photosynthesis
    and stomatal conductance. A dynamic global vegetation model, Integrated Biosphere
    Simulator (IBIS) (Foley et al., 1996, Kucharik et al., 2000), was adapted to develop
    Agro-IBIS (Kucharik & Brye, 2003) to simulate agricultural plant types such as
    corn, wheat, and soybean across the US in addition to generalized plant functional
    types already simulated by IBIS. The soil physics module of the AgroIBIS-VSF uses
    Hydrus-1D to simulate the interactions of variably saturated soil moisture and
    surface fluxes. The model uses hourly time steps to capture the rapid surface
    flux exchanges. The soil module uses an adaptive time-stepping scheme, which may
    use time steps shorter than 1-hour to ensure its numerical stability. The model
    numerically solves Richards’ equation in one dimension to obtain water and heat
    transport within its soil domain: where θ is volumetric water content [-], h is
    the pressure head [L], z is the vertical coordinate [L], and S(h) is the sink
    term [L3/L−3(−|-) T−1] (i.e., plant water uptake rate). Hydraulic conductivity,
    pressure heads, and volumetric water contents are related using the empirical
    functions of van Genuchten (1980): where θr and θs are the residual and saturated
    volumetric water contents, respectively [-], Se is effective saturation [-], α
    is the inverse of the air-entry value [L–1], n is the pore size distribution index
    [-], l is a pore-connectivity parameter [-], which is considered as 0.5 as an
    average for many soils, and m is equal to 1–1/n [-]. AgroIBIS-VSF calculates transpiration
    based on the land-surface-transfer model of Pollard & Thompson, (1995) as follows:
    where ρ is the density of near-surface air, v is the heat/vapor transfer coefficient
    between canopy and air, fwet is the fraction of leaf area wetted by intercepted
    water or snow, qsat and q are the saturation specific humidity at the leaf temperature
    and ambient specific humidity, respectively, LAI is the single-sided leaf area
    index, and L is the leaf temperature. Leaf level stomatal conductance per unit
    leaf area (gs) is calculated by (Ball, 1988, Collatz et al., 1991):: where Cs
    is the CO2 concentration at the leaf surface, ks is the relative humidity at the
    leaf surface, m and p are the slope and intercept of the conductance–photosynthesis
    relationship, and An is the net leaf CO2 assimilation rate calculated by the minimum
    of three potential photosynthesis rates, including light-limited rate, CO2-limited
    rate, and the Rubisco-limited rate of photosynthesis. The Rubisco-limited photosynthesis
    rate is controlled by soil moisture limitation and leaf temperature and is calculated
    as follows: where Vmax is the maximum capacity of Rubisco activity to perform
    carboxylase function at the top of the canopy, f(L) is calculated as a function
    of leaf temperature (L), Ri is the root biomass in a given soil layer i, and μi
    is a stress factor, calculated based on soil moisture availability with a similar
    linear piece-wise equation used in the bucket-type hydrology model explained in
    the previous section using hydraulic heads (h) instead of saturation degrees (s),
    represented by the following relationship: where hw and h* are the pressure heads
    at the wilting point and drought-induced incipient stomatal closure point, respectively.
    2.3. Model parameterizations, inputs, and the field sites We selected two irrigated
    field sites with AmeriFlux tower stations in the western US. One is in a water-limited
    and another in an energy-limited regions. The water-limited site is located in
    the Central Valley, California (referred to as the CA site henceforth, 36.24°
    N, 119.93° W), and the energy-limited site is at Eugene, Oregon (referred to as
    the OR site henceforth, 44.14° N, 123.18° W) (Fig. 1). The CA site is classified
    as a cold semi-arid (BSk) climate subtype of the Köppen climate classification.
    This subtype is characterized by warm to hot, dry summers and cold, possibly freezing
    winters. Summers are dry and winters are relatively wet in these regions. The
    OR site is classified as a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Csb) subtype of
    the Köppen climate classification. This subtype experiences warm, dry summers
    and mild to chilly, rainy winters. The average annual precipitation values for
    the CA and OR sites are 197.6 mm and 1002.2 mm, respectively, during the period
    of interest between 2015 and 2021. The average potential evapotranspiration values
    are 771.2 mm and 1770.4 mm for OR and CA sites, respectively. Both sites are dominated
    by agriculturally grown deciduous broadleaf trees with heights exceeding 2 m.
    Eddy covariance flux towers were available at these sites. Available flux data
    and more information about the setting of each site can be accessed via (Law,
    2019) and (Anderson, 2020) for the OR and CA sites, respectively. Download : Download

    the AmeriFlux eddy covariance towers located in energy-limited Eugene, Oregon
    and water-limited Central Valley, California, sites. The meteorological data required
    to drive the models were obtained from the gridMET dataset (Abatzoglou, 2013),
    which provides publicly available daily surface meteorological data across the
    contiguous United States since 1979. The gridMET dataset provides all meteorological
    data requirements to drive AgroIBIS-VSF, including precipitation, minimum and
    maximum temperature, radiation, wind speed, and relative humidity on a daily time
    step. The atmospheric forcing required to drive the bucket model are precipitation
    and ETp, which was calculated by employing the Penman–Monteith equation (Allen
    et al., 1998, Monteith, 1981) using the gridMET meteorological variables and obtained
    precipitation from the same dataset to run the bucket-type hydrology model for
    specific field sites. The soil hydraulic parameters were obtained from a global
    scale dataset (Montzka et al., 2017). This dataset provides van Genuchten soil
    parameters globally at a 0.25-degree spatial resolution for seven soil layers
    extending from the surface to a depth of 2 m. We used only the soil parameters
    at the top layer in the bucket model and assigned the soil hydraulic parameters
    provided in all seven layers to the corresponding soil layers in the AgroIBIS-VSF.
    Only saturated volumetric water content (θs) was modified from the global dataset
    to match the maximum soil moisture captured by SMAP observations. Van Genuchten’s
    soil hydraulic parameters used for the sites are shown in Table 1. The thickness
    of the soil domain in AgroIBIS-VSF was set to 2 m, sufficient to cover almost
    all root biomass. We ran sensitivity simulations with the bucket model to determine
    both the empirical b parameter to be used in the bucket model’s soil retention
    curve and the optimum bucket size based on how well the model simulates SMAP soil
    moisture observations at both the CA and the OR sites. We ran the bucket model
    multiple times using bucket sizes ranging from 5 cm to 100 cm with increments
    of 5 cm. Fig. 2 shows the various bucket lengths on the x-axis against the root
    mean square errors and coefficient of determinations between the simulated soil
    moisture and SMAP observations. The figure indicates that while smaller bucket
    sizes perform better for the CA site simulation with the smallest error reached
    at 15 cm, the model performed better with relatively deeper bucket sizes at the
    OR site, where the best performance was reached when the bucket size is at 35
    cm. The errors increase exponentially when the bucket size is smaller than its
    optimum size. This was because the infiltrated rainfall quickly drained from the
    thin root zones, and the model tended to be drier than the observed soil moisture
    values. Considering that the SMAP observations are assumed to represent approximately
    the top 5 cm of the soil moisture owing to the penetration ability of L-band microwave
    emission into the surface, we adopted the minimum possible bucket length for the
    model simulations that reasonably agreed with observations with minimal error,
    which was 15 cm and 35 cm for the CA and OR sites, respectively. Table 1. Soil

    (SMAP) mission soil moisture observations (Entekhabi et al., 2014) in our analyses.
    SMAP monitors soil moisture on a global scale with approximately a 3-day temporal
    resolution by measuring the natural thermal emission of the surface. The SMAP
    sensors use L-band microwave emissions, focusing on the top 5 cm of the soil column.
    Specifically, we use the 9-km spatial resolution SMAP Level 2 enhanced passive
    soil moisture SMAP (SPL2SMP_E) product (Chan et al., 2018). This enhanced product
    is derived from 36-km SMAP passive microwave radiometer L-band brightness temperatures
    by applying the Backus-Gilbert optimal interpolation technique to the antenna
    temperature measurements in the original SMAP product. 3. Irrigation estimation
    approach Models that do not explicitly incorporate irrigation can lead to substantial
    discrepancies between simulated and observed soil moisture during growing seasons.
    Accurately representing irrigation is challenging due to the diverse practices
    adopted by farmers (United States Department of Agriculture, 2019). Although data
    assimilation and soil hydraulic parameter adjustment methods are employed to mitigate
    discrepancies between observations and model estimates when irrigation practices
    are unknown, these methods are insufficient in addressing systematic errors caused
    by the introduction of unaccounted irrigation water during the growing season
    (Kumar et al., 2015, Kwon et al., 2022). By incorporating irrigation data into
    the models, it is possible to enhance model accuracy and minimize disparities
    between simulated and observed soil moisture. Studies have demonstrated that microwave
    soil moisture observations from SMAP can successfully capture irrigation signals
    (Brocca et al., 2018, Lawston et al., 2017). Once quantified, irrigation estimates
    may be directly used with models to avert erroneous simulations during the growing
    season. To quantify irrigation amounts, we identified irrigation periods during
    the growing seasons by analyzing deviations in soil moisture simulations from
    SMAP observations. Subsequently, we calculated the required irrigation input for
    the model by supplementing the rainfall input with the determined irrigation amounts
    until the model-simulated soil moisture aligns well with the SMAP observations.
    If the SMAP soil moisture reading exceeded the simulated soil moisture during
    the growing season in irrigated areas, we introduced irrigation to the model''s
    upper boundary. We then applied an iterative process for the same day, dynamically
    adjusting the irrigation volume until alignment with the SMAP observations was
    achieved. Once we estimated daily irrigation quantities using the bucket model,
    we utilized them in the more sophisticated ecosystem model, AgroIBIS-VSF, as explained
    in the next section, instead of employing the same computationally intensive iterative
    irrigation estimation procedure throughout the growing seasons. This choice was
    motivated by the need to avoid the substantial computational burden associated
    with multiple daily restarts of the AgroIBIS-VSF model. Using the meteorological
    data as upper boundary conditions, soil moisture simulations from the bucket model
    with and without irrigation addition were compared (Fig. 3). Simulated soil moisture
    values corresponded well with observations with the tendency of underestimation
    in the OR site during non-growing seasons. Simulations with no irrigation scenarios
    showed systematic underestimation of soil moisture during the growing season at
    both stations, supporting the assumption that irrigation signals can be captured
    by SMAP data. Download : Download high-res image (1010KB) Download : Download

    magenta bars show rainfall and irrigation estimations for (a) the Oregon site
    and (b) the California site. The period that SMAP observations were missing is
    marked with grey stripes. The annual sums of model-estimated irrigation values
    show that the annual average irrigation amount at the CA site is more than double
    that of the OR station (Fig. 4). The annual average irrigation in the CA site
    was 319.23 mm with a 78.25 mm standard deviation and 138.21 mm in the OR site
    with a 40.37 mm standard deviation. The fraction of irrigation to the annual rainfall
    at each site is also substantially different. While the average irrigation is
    up to 3.2 times higher than the annual rainfall in the CA site (during the 2020
    drought) with a mean of 1.6 times, only 14 percent of the annual rainfall amount
    of irrigation is sufficient to reproduce the soil moisture in the OR site with
    a small year-to-year variation. Download : Download high-res image (123KB) Download

    of irrigation on plant productivity and evapotranspiration The AgroIBIS-VSF model
    is used to simulate ecosystem dynamics and address questions 2 and 3 of the introduction.
    Although AgroIBIS-VSF and its predecessors (e.g., IBIS and Agro-IBIS models) have
    been extensively tested against a variety of observations at various scales (Kucharik
    and Brye, 2003, Kucharik and Twine, 2007, Soylu et al., 2014), we provide additional
    model testing specific to the field sites of interest. To evaluate AgroIBIS-VSF’s
    ability to simulate the energy balance components in the field sites, we compared
    model results to Eddy Covariance flux tower observations for the water-limited
    CA and energy-limited OR sites (Fig. 5), using the deciduous broadleaf forest
    plant functional type and applying adjusted irrigation quantities estimated by
    the bucket model in both locations. The OR site observations covered both growing
    and non-growing seasons during 2015, allowing us to compare simulations with and
    without irrigation against observations. Our results indicate that the irrigated
    scenario leads to substantially higher latent heat fluxes during the summer months,
    which causes lower sensible heat fluxes. Net radiation simulations remained similar
    between irrigated and non-irrigated cases in OR, with a slight increase in irrigated
    simulations during the summer months. Simulations with irrigation outperformed
    those without irrigation against tower observations for all three energy-balance
    components with lower root mean square error (RMSE) values. RMSE values of latent
    heat fluxes are 28.02 and 34.25 W m−2; sensible heat fluxes are 40.85 and 46.45
    W m−2; net radiation are 6.07 and 15.69 W m−2 for irrigated and not irrigated
    scenarios at the OR site, respectively. Eddy covariance observations in the CA
    site are limited to winter months with no significant irrigation. Nevertheless,
    the overall model-generated energy balance outputs also agreed well with the eddy
    tower observations during that period. Download : Download high-res image (431KB)

    with and without irrigation, respectively. Red dots represent Eddy covariance
    flux tower observations at the corresponding locations. The plots show moving
    averages of the energy balance components with a weekly moving window. The top
    ((a) and (b)), middle ((c) and (d)), and bottom ((e) and (f)) panels show latent
    heat fluxes, sensible heat fluxes, and net radiation, respectively. To confirm
    the accuracy of AgroIBIS-VSF, we performed the same simulations conducted with
    the bucket model, as shown in Fig. 3. We used the meteorological drivers from
    the gridMET dataset and soil hydraulic parameters from the (Montzka et al., 2017)
    dataset. Although the majority of the model inputs were consistent between the
    two models, introducing irrigation quantities estimated by the bucket model into
    AgroIBIS-VSF led to an overestimation of soil moisture levels during the growing
    season. This discrepancy can be attributed to the substantial differences in the
    complexities and structures of these models along with their soil retention curve
    models, resulting in varying responses of soil moisture to irrigation. To simulate
    the irrigation scenarios within AgroIBIS-VSF, we incorporated daily irrigation
    quantities reduced by 30 %, as estimated by the bucket model, for both the OR
    and CA sites. The model outcomes exhibited a consistent trend of underestimating
    soil moisture in the OR site during non-growing seasons, similar to what was observed
    in the bucket model (Fig. 6). The AgroIBIS-VSF soil moisture agreed well with
    the SMAP soil moisture observations at both sites when adjusted irrigation was
    introduced. The RMSE for the summer months soil moisture values are 0.0564 and
    0.034 for the OR and the CA sites in the absence of irrigation. These RMSE values
    changed to 0.0451 for OR and 0.016 for CA when irrigation was introduced to the
    model, indicating a substantial improvement in the model''s agreement with observed
    soil moisture levels. Download : Download high-res image (848KB) Download : Download

    with and without including the irrigation quantities adjusted from the bucket
    hydrology model. We then explored the impacts of irrigation on net primary productivity
    (NPP) and actual evapotranspiration (ETa) by comparing the model-generated NPP
    and ETa of irrigated and non-irrigated simulations at both water- and energy-limited
    sites. The annual average ETa in the water-limited CA (energy-limited OR) site
    is 297.8 mm (379.7 mm), which can satisfy 16.8 % (49.2 %) of the potential ET
    (Fig. 7). With the introduction of estimated irrigation, in addition to rainfall
    during the growing season, this percentage increased to an average of 24.0 % for
    the CA site and 56.6 % for the OR site. Fig. 7 illustrates that while the total
    ETa quantities in both sites are comparable, their partitions of evapotranspiration
    exhibited significant disparities. Transpiration accounted for about 80 % of the
    average annual ETa in the OR site, whereas it comprised only 25 % of the ETa in
    the CA site (Fig. 7(a and c)). This substantial variation in transpiration also
    resulted in notable differences in plant net primary productivity (NPP). The inclusion
    of additional irrigation water into the agricultural ecosystem led to increased
    plant productivity in both locations. The average increase in annual average NPP
    at the CA site was 47.3 %, with a maximum of 253.0 % during the dry year of 2018.
    In contrast, the OR site experienced an average annual NPP increase of 17.1 %
    due to irrigation. However, these percentage changes can be somewhat misleading,
    as the actual average NPP increase with irrigation at the OR site was 85.1 g m−2
    year−1, more than twice the increase seen at the CA site (34.8 g m−2 year−1) (Fig.
    7). Download : Download high-res image (355KB) Download : Download full-size image

    and without-irrigation simulations, respectively. 5. Irrigation water use efficiency
    and value of water Irrigation water generates value in agriculture by increasing
    crop productivity. In the sections above, first, we provided a method to quantify
    irrigation using SMAP soil moisture observations and a basic bucket-type hydrology
    model. Second, we estimated crop productivity increases as a result of irrigation
    for an energy-limited site and a water-limited site. In this section, we present
    a concise illustration of how these insights can be effectively integrated and
    applied in the practical context of valuing water resources in agriculture. D’Odorico
    et al. (2020) proposed an approach to estimate the net economic benefit of water.
    They defined benefit as the net value of the output minus the costs of obtaining
    the water, loss of ecosystem services due to water use for irrigation, opportunity
    lost, such as the value that could have been generated by the water if it stayed
    in storage, and crop production costs associated with extra water such as labor,
    fertilizer, and machinery. We use a simpler definition of the value of a unit
    of irrigation water (Vw), ignoring costs (D’Odorico et al., 2020): where Pc is
    the crop price, ΔY is the incremental change in output due to irrigation, and
    I is the applied irrigation. In their original method, D’Odorico et al. (2020)
    used the term “irrigation water requirement” (IWR) as the denominator rather than
    actual applied irrigation. The IWR can be estimated as a function of the difference
    between the crop water requirement to reach the plant’s maximum possible yield
    and rain-fed crop water consumption. However, it is important to acknowledge that
    delivering the entire water requirement to plants is not always possible, as it
    could lead to water stress. Conversely, depending on the irrigation method, there
    may be excess water application, surpassing the plant''s actual needs. To account
    for these complexities, we used our observation-based estimate of the actual irrigation
    water applied as the denominator in our analyses. Fig. 8(a) illustrates the changes
    in NPP as a result of estimated irrigation quantities on an annual scale. We calculated
    the changes in NPP by subtracting the simulated NPP from the irrigated scenarios
    from the NPP simulated in no irrigation scenarios. These changes in NPP are directly
    correlated with the incremental change in crop output (ΔY in the equation above).
    Assuming a constant crop price (Pc) at both CA and OR sites, the y-axis in Fig.
    8(b) serves as an indicator of the irrigation water value. Notably, the estimated
    irrigation quantities differ between the two sites during the designated period.
    Fig. 8(b) reveals that the water value at the CA site remains relatively constant
    regardless of the annual irrigation amounts, whereas the irrigation value at the
    OR site tends to progressively increase with higher annual irrigation quantities
    during the analyzed period. On average, the irrigation water value is notably
    higher at the OR site compared to the CA site. It is important to note that while
    irrigation water value is relatively constant at the CA site, it varies as a function
    of annual irrigation at the OR site (Fig. 8(b)). Download : Download high-res

    projected CA site. 6. Discussions and conclusion We developed a basic method to
    quantify irrigation amounts using a bucket-type soil moisture hydrology model
    based on SMAP soil moisture observations. First, we applied this method to estimate
    irrigation amounts in two field sites located in a water-limited region (Central
    Valley, CA) and an energy-limited region (Eugene, OR) in the western US. Then,
    using AgroIBIS-VSF, a physically based ecosystem model, we calculated the additional
    NPP of plants that result from the estimated irrigation during seven years’ worth
    of data and model simulations. The method to quantify irrigation amounts is based
    on the differences between soil moisture observations and simulations. We calculated
    the amount of additional water that needed to be added to the upper boundary of
    the soil column to obtain agreement between simulated and SMAP-observed soil moisture.
    This was done at a daily time scale during the growing season. Although this approach
    is a robust method to calculate irrigation, certain assumptions must be made.
    For example, the uncertainties associated with SMAP observations and stochasticity
    stemming from model parameterization were not considered. Therefore, irrigation
    estimations were assumed to be deterministically calculated. Verifying estimates
    of irrigation against field observations is extremely difficult for two main reasons.
    First, the irrigation estimates are based on a relatively coarse SMAP soil moisture
    resolution compared to individual irrigated field sizes. An individual SMAP pixel
    may or may not be fully covered by an agricultural field. Therefore, the observations
    represent the average soil moisture in a given pixel comprised of various land
    cover patterns. As a result, soil moisture pulses due to irrigation originating
    from some of the SMAP pixels may be captured but attenuated. Capturing small amounts
    of irrigation in individual fields becomes more challenging as the spatial resolution
    of the image is coarse. It is important to note that in both selected field sites,
    the surrounding areas encompassed sufficiently extensive agricultural fields where
    the SMAP data could effectively detect the impact of irrigation-induced soil moisture
    increase. Second, the SMAP signals represent area-averaged soil moisture in a
    single snapshot at approximately three-day intervals. Likely, multiple agricultural
    fields managed by different farmers with various irrigation schedules were within
    a given SMAP pixel. Therefore, the captured soil moisture signals rarely correspond
    to the times when the fields reached their highest saturation levels in all irrigated
    fields. Rather, the time the SMAP images are taken is more likely to represent
    variations of soil conditions before, after, or rarely at its peak irrigation
    in each field within the SMAP pixel. This implies that we are capturing attenuated
    signals due to reduced soil moisture from drainage and evapotranspiration losses,
    probably resulting in an underestimation of irrigation quantities. In a recent
    study, Zappa et al. (2022) investigated the impacts of the spatiotemporal resolution
    of soil moisture on the quantification of irrigation water amounts. They also
    found that the underestimation of irrigation water amounts is larger when the
    spatial or temporal resolution of the soil moisture dataset becomes coarser. Even
    if we use high spatial and temporal resolution images to capture soil moisture
    signals due to irrigation, we still need to know when, how much, and how efficiently
    irrigation is applied in each agricultural field to accurately quantify a certain
    irrigation consumption. The underestimation of irrigation could lead to reduced
    crop productivity simulations as a possible outcome. However, it is important
    to note that the expected reduction in crop productivity is not anticipated to
    be substantial. This is because the method we introduced may only partially capture
    the peak irrigation times due to the timing of satellite overflights, although
    it does capture the period within approximately three days after irrigation. During
    this time frame, most excess water is typically lost through surface and subsurface
    runoff, referred to as drainage. Yet, any water retained in the soil below field
    capacity is accounted for and simulated. As a result, the productivity constraints
    due to water scarcity are expected to be minimal. Similar to the previous irrigation
    quantification endeavors, our approach is also associated with uncertainties due
    to various factors, including model parameterization, coarse satellite data resolution,
    time differences in satellite pass-time and storm events, and the diversity of
    agrarian practices. Ignoring these inherent biases and relying solely on irrigation
    estimations from current methodologies when making decisions about water resources
    management can result in erroneous water balance calculations, ultimately leading
    to unsustainable water resource management (Puy et al., 2022). While we anticipate
    that future advancements in methodologies may help alleviate some of these biases,
    the primary constraints stem from the current state of remote sensing technology
    and modeling capabilities. It is important to note that current approaches cannot
    address issues such as irrigation efficiency, the percolation of excess irrigation
    water into deeper soil layers, and the subgrid variations in irrigation quantities.
    However, despite these limitations, the estimations derived from our current approaches
    hold significant promise. Once implemented into LSMs, these irrigation estimations
    can enhance the precision of soil moisture simulations, leading to more accurate
    representations of surface energy, water, and carbon flux partitioning in global
    models. Moreover, we used the estimated irrigation quantities to run AgroIBIS-VSF,
    an agroecosystem model, to determine the efficiency of irrigation water in terms
    of vegetation productivity. This allowed us to compare the value of irrigation
    water in water-limited and energy-limited sites. Our findings indicate that, on
    average, almost twice the annual rainfall amount is applied as irrigation each
    year at the CA site, satisfying only slightly less than half of the total atmospheric
    demand. Additional irrigation resulted in a 47.3 % increase in average annual
    NPP at the CA site. On the other hand, applying irrigation to the energy-limited
    OR site only resulted in a 17.1 % increase in annual NPP. Under the no-irrigation
    scenario, NPP is 4.7 times higher at the OR site on average. This rate was reduced
    to 4.0 times once irrigation was applied to both sites. The findings of this study
    reveal that irrigation water has more than five times the value in the energy-limited
    OR site compared to the CA site, on average. This difference stems from the significantly
    higher NPP, which serves as an indicator of crop yield, achieved in the OR site
    as compared to the CA site. This finding may seem to challenge the common belief
    that water-limited areas can achieve better crop yields when provided with sufficient
    water. In reality, the practicality of supplying ample water to crops on a large
    scale in regions like the CA site, characterized by prolonged dry periods during
    the growing season, is often hindered by high costs associated with water acquisition.
    This challenge is particularly exacerbated by the Central Valley''s already deep
    and continuously depleting water table, further complicating the situation in
    the water-limited CA site (Jasechko & Perrone, 2020). The disparities in soil
    hydraulic properties between the two sites (Table 1) also significantly impact
    the valuation of irrigation water. The soil in the OR site possesses a higher
    capacity to retain irrigation water within the root zone for an extended duration
    due to its nearly twice as high air entry pressure value compared to the CA site.
    Additionally, the higher pore size distribution index (n) in the OR site reflects
    a more diverse range of pore sizes, further aiding in the retention of irrigation
    water. Furthermore, the OR site soil has a 33 % greater porosity, which enhances
    its ability to store more irrigation water within the root zone. Lastly, the hydraulic
    conductivity is significantly higher in the OR site, facilitating improved accessibility
    of irrigation water to the plant''s roots (Table 1). These findings highlight
    the crucial role of soil hydraulic properties in the valuation of irrigation water.
    However, further in-depth investigations are warranted to gain a better understanding
    of the specific impact of soil characteristics on irrigation water value. A comprehensive
    understanding of the relative importance of climate, soil parameters, and crop
    types will enable the development of effective strategies for water resource management
    and enhanced food security. Lastly, to accurately assess the value of irrigation
    water, it is essential to consider the associated costs, which we have assumed
    to have no contribution to the final water value in this study. Neglecting costs
    such as water acquisition, loss of ecosystem services, opportunity costs, and
    crop production expenses (e.g., labor, fertilizer, and machinery) can significantly
    alter the ultimate value of irrigation water. The economic benefit of water is
    defined as the net value minus the costs associated with water (D’Odorico et al.,
    2020). As the cost of obtaining water increases, the economic benefit provided
    by water decreases accordingly. Therefore, it is crucial for future studies to
    include water costs when estimating the value of irrigation water, as this consideration
    may reveal even higher relative water values in energy-limited regions. Declaration

    2. Irrigation can significantly alter the water and carbon balances in water-

    3. The relative value of irrigation varies depending on the climate conditions.'
  limitations: 'The method to quantify irrigation amounts is based on the differences

    associated with SMAP observations and model parameterization, coarse satellite
    data resolution, time differences in satellite pass-time and storm events, and
    the diversity of agrarian practices.

    The AgroIBIS-VSF ecosystem model used in this study is a deterministic model,
    which does not consider the uncertainty stemming from model parameterization.
    Therefore, the irrigation estimations are assumed to be deterministically calculated.

    The results of the study are based on two field sites, which may not represent
    the full range of climate conditions and agricultural practices in the world.'

  explanation: 'Paper discusses the sub-topic of Anomaly detection and predictive
    maintenance using AI techniques in the section titled ''Anomaly detection and
    predictive maintenance using AI techniques''.


    In the sub-topic, the authors highlight that anomaly detection and predictive
    maintenance are crucial components of the IoT/IIoT automated systems for real-time
    irrigation management.


    They state that anomaly detection involves identifying deviations from normal
    behavior using AI techniques, while predictive maintenance uses AI to predict
    potential failures and enable timely intervention.


    The authors provide a use case example of a vineyard irrigation system where anomaly
    detection and predictive maintenance techniques are used to optimize water usage,
    reduce energy consumption, and improve crop yields.


    They present the main findings or results of the study in the following points:


    - Anomaly detection and predictive maintenance using AI techniques can significantly
    enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of automated irrigation systems.

    - These techniques can detect anomalies in sensor data, identify potential failures,
    and predict future events, enabling proactive maintenance and optimization.

    - The use of AI in anomaly detection and predictive maintenance can help reduce
    costs, improve productivity, and increase sustainability in agricultural irrigation.


    The main objective or research question of the study is to investigate the application
    and benefits of anomaly detection and predictive maintenance using AI techniques
    in automated irrigation systems.


    The authors used a vineyard irrigation system as a case study to demonstrate the
    effectiveness of these techniques in optimizing water usage, reducing energy consumption,
    and improving crop yields.


    The authors'' approach to the study involved:


    - Collecting sensor data from the irrigation system, including soil moisture,
    temperature, and flow rate.

    - Analyzing the data using AI techniques to detect anomalies and predict potential
    failures.

    - Implementing automated actions based on the analysis results to optimize irrigation
    schedules, detect leaks, and prevent equipment failures.


    The authors'' findings have implications for the development, implementation,
    and management of automated irrigation systems in agriculture and other industries.


    They suggest that anomaly detection and predictive maintenance using AI techniques
    can significantly enhance the efficiency, effectiveness, and sustainability of
    these systems.'

    for enterprises to improve efficiencies and enhance customer value. IoT/IIoT continues
    to evolve with new technologies and applications, embedding ubiquitous hyperconnectivity
    (5G and beyond), edge/fog computing, distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) and
    artificial intelligence (AI). IoT/IIoT operates in a continuum that connects the
    physical, digital, virtual and cyber worlds through intelligent ‘Digital Twins’
    by generating constant streams of data that can be harnessed into actionable distributed
    intelligence at the edge, with human, machine-to-machine cooperation to improve
    life, work and interaction with the everyday world. Next-generation Tactile IoT/IIoT
    builds a real-time interactive system between the human and the machine and introduces
    a new evolution in human-machine (H2M) communication. Tactile IoT/IIoT enables
    the transfer of physical ‘senses’ (e.g. sense/touch, actuation, hepatic actions,
    etc.) in real-time form remotely and introduces a new paradigm shift to the skill-based/knowledge-based
    networks instead of content-based networks. New solutions are needed for addressing
    IoT distributed end-to-end security because there are many more IoT/IIoT devices
    to secure, compared with traditional IT infrastructure devices. Many IoT/IIoT
    devices are embedded into systems that can affect physical health and safety,
    in addition to traditional communications or computing systems, and they introduce
    a complex management environment, with diverse technology profiles, processing
    capabilities, use-cases, and physical locations. The chapters in the book present
    and discuss the next-generation IoT/IIoT research and innovation trends by addressing
    the enabling technologies, such as network technologies, edge/fog computing, distributed
    ledger technologies, AI, and the challenges for security, network management and
    integration for future IoT applications across industrial sectors. The IoT/IIoT
    development ahead implies a human-centric approach that involves a judicious and
    dynamic balancing of collaboration and competition in IoT ecosystems in a common
    quest for advancing the digital transformation of industry and economy for the
    benefit of society and citizens. Editors Biography Dr. Ovidiu Vermesan holds a

    State of Play and Future Perspectives Mechthild Rohen European Commission, Belgium
    1.1 Introduction Two years have passed since the publication of our Digitising
    European Industry (DEI) strategy, whose overall objective is to ensure that any
    industry in Europe, big or small, wherever situated and in any sector can fully
    benefit from digital innovations to upgrade its products, improve its processes
    and adapt its business models to the digital transformation. The underlying scenario
    is represented by the European platform of national initiatives on DEI, including
    digital innovation hubs, regulatory framework, skills and jobs, partnership and
    platforms (Figure 1.1). Figure 1.1 DEI 4 main actions. IoT is at the heart of
    the digitisation process of the economy and society and it is an essential building
    block of the DEI strategy and the Digital Single Market strategy. Therefore, the
    overall goal is for Europe to be at the forefront of supplying innovative IoT
    solutions and to become the world’s leading market for IoT products and services.
    As part of the DEI strategy, the goal for developing IoT leadership encompasses
    several building blocks funded under Horizon 2020: The IoT-European Platforms
    Initiative (IoT-EPI), addressing interoperability of IoT platforms, creating the
    ecosystem, using architectures, and integrating systems and networks for a multiplicity
    of novel applications; The Focus Area on IoT under Crosscutting Activities in
    the Horizon 2020 Work Programme 2016–2017, on experimentation with real-life solutions,
    tested at large scale with users; and The Focus Area on Digitising and transforming
    European industry and services under the Horizon 2020 Work Programme 2018–2020,
    which supports the DEI strategy on digitization of industrial sectors, integrating
    digital technologies and innovation across societal challenges (Figure 1.2). Figure
    1.2 Overall EU IoT strategy. These building blocks are further elaborated below
    to provide with an overview of the state of play of the EU initiatives and activities.
    1.2 Research and Innovation under Horizon 2020 The IoT-European Platforms Initiative
    (IoT-EPI) was formed to build a vibrant and sustainable IoT-ecosystem in Europe,
    maximising the opportunities for open platform development, interoperability and
    information sharing. At the core of the programme there are seven research and
    innovation projects and two coordination and support actions: Inter-IoT, BIG IoT,
    AGILE, SymbIoTe, TagItSmart, Vicinity, bIoTope, Be-IoT and UNIFY-IoT. With a total
    funding of EUR 50 million and a partner network of 120 organizations, these projects
    develop innovative solutions focusing on IoT architectures and semantic interoperability.
    Furthermore, they also foster technology adoption through the development of use
    cases in several industrial sectors, and community and business building activities.
    All projects ran within the time-frame of 2016–2018 – with one (Vicinity) extending
    until 2019. The IoT-EPI projects are cooperating to define the research and innovation
    mechanisms and to identify opportunities for collaboration in IoT ecosystems to
    maximise the opportunities for common approaches to platform development, interoperability
    and information sharing. The common activities are organised under six task forces
    that are conceived and developed under IoT-EPI (Figure 1.3). Figure 1.3 IoT-EPI
    Task Forces. Each of the six Task Forces have produced major results in terms
    of research, but also in terms of policy, which has created a real impact on the
    European IoT market [1]. Some of the key results include: The analysis of IoT
    platforms showing a market growing rapidly, but still fragmented, with hundreds
    of different and incompatible platforms. This report on IoT landscape has been
    further developed and published by the Alliance for Internet of Things Innovation
    (AIOTI) [2]; The publication of a white paper on IoT platform interoperability,
    compiling the lessons learnt and results from the seven projects [4]; The development
    of an open architecture and open IoT business model framework that has set the
    foundation of cooperation with the developers and entrepreneurs community, and
    that has mobilised SMEs and start-ups to join the ecosystem. In eleven open calls,
    with more than 100 external IoT-teams, the IoT-EPI has planned an investment of
    more than EUR 5.5 million until December 2018 to nurture an IoT ecosystem around
    the seven core projects; The development of policy recommendations for the uptake
    of IoT in Europe; and The set-up of an education platform using the results of
    the IoT-EPI projects. Besides the IoT-EPI Task Forces, adequate security, trust
    and privacy are key issues to be tackled in connection with IoT, and therefore
    a specific cluster of project addressing these issues has been launched under
    Horizon 2020 in 2017. Seven projects have been selected with a total EU contribution
    of EUR 37 million in order to develop and test solutions providing IoT security,
    trust and privacy (ENACT, IoTCrawler, SecureIoT, BRAIN-IoT, SOFIE, CHARIOT, SEMIoTICS,
    SerIoT). The projects address the key issues of end-to-end security and trust
    in open IoT Platforms, as well as advanced concepts for IoT security and prevention
    of cyber-attacks, including blockchains and distributed ledger technology, which
    are tested in a set of ambitious use cases. In addition, the projects deploy open
    IoT platforms and include a strong contribution to upcoming open standards in
    IoT security. 1.3 Deployment – IoT Focus Area and Focus Area on Digitization In
    order to foster the uptake of IoT in Europe and to enable the emergence of IoT
    ecosystems supported by open technologies, the European Commission launched an
    IoT Focus Area that supports the IoT European Large-Scale Pilots Programme (IoT-LSPs)
    on deployment of IoT at large in Europe. These IoT-LSPs started on 1 January 2017
    and are funded with a budget of EUR 100 million. The IoT-LSPs cover the following
    domains: Smart living environments for ageing well (ACTIVAGE); Smart Farming and
    Food Security (IoF2020); Wearables for smart ecosystems (MONICA); Reference zones
    in EU cities (SYNCHRONICITY); and Autonomous vehicles in a connected environment
    (AUTOPILOT). With these pilots, the European Commission is supporting the testing
    and experimentation of new IoT related technologies with the involvement of and
    result validation by end users. These pilots are expected to accelerate the standards
    setting across different business sectors, boosting further the IoT technology
    and provide input to policy developments, such as data protection, privacy and
    security. Since January 2017, several successful results have been achieved. Each
    funded project is applying IoT approaches to specific real-life challenges across
    use cases, based on European relevance, technology readiness and socio-economic
    interest in Europe. More than 50 use cases have taken shape and are now fully
    running. This has also allowed the LSPs to work together in order to define common
    high-level architecture models. Another example is the well-defined and good cooperation
    among LSPs, which develop common mechanisms for the publication of open calls
    to enlarge their consortia with new partners, in particular SMEs. These open calls
    provide so-called cascading funds as financial support targeted to involve especially
    SMEs and start-ups to get access to pilot testing in an open and lean way. In
    the Horizon 2020 Work Programme 2018–2020, the European Commission aims to use
    the strong concept of a Focus Area on Digitisation (Digitising and transforming
    European industry and services), accounting for EUR 250 million funding and forming
    a significant part of ICT calls in the Horizon 2020 Work Programme 2018–2020.
    Success in implementation of the Focus Area will depend to a large extent on the
    capacity to work across the digital, societal and industrial topics that are grouped
    under this Focus Area. The Focus Area requires close cooperation of different
    services across different DGs, namely CONNECT, GROW, RTD, AGRI and ENER, to ensure
    coherent policy setting across areas which so far were siloed economic and policy
    areas, e.g. to support Digitisation under the Energy Union or the Common Agriculture
    Policy. Calls will close in November 2018 and resulting from this Focus Area,
    a further set of pilots will be launched in 2019 across different areas, such
    as health and care, energy efficiency, agriculture and industry 4.0. These pilots
    will accelerate standards setting across different business sectors, boosting
    further the investments and scalable market creation for IoT technology. This
    focus area will be funded by several parts of the Horizon 2020 programme, mainly
    by the Leadership in Enabling and Industrial Technologies and Societal Challenges
    pillars. Pilot activities will be supported in the areas of Smart Farming, Digitisation
    of Energy, Digital Health and Rural Platforms, as depicted in Figure 1.4. Figure
    1.4 Focus Area on Digitization. 1.4 IoT within the Next Generation Internet –
    Preparing the Next Framework Programme for Research and Innovation IoT continues
    to evolve rapidly, in particular in response to the major trends, such as the
    ever-increasing volumes of data generated and extraction of knowledge through
    smart data analytics, as well as increasing levels of automation and decision
    making, made possible by smart sensors, devices and actuators combined with machine
    learning and artificial intelligence. In addition, there are new real-time requirements
    emerging, such as in industrial production and autonomous cars, which must be
    addressed. The capacity of communication networks is ever increasing with 5G deployment
    starting and processing power is still increasing exponentially, allowing for
    new distributed architectures (e.g. cognitive cloud, fog or edge computing) and
    solutions. Also, new approaches to reduce or eliminate intermediaries, by building
    on blockchains and distributed ledgers, and the power to control access to and
    sharing of data, lead to new value chains and business models, which will open
    new opportunities for European companies and user communities. This is all encapsulated
    in the vision of a Next Generation Internet, which is more human-centric in terms
    of identity, data protection and privacy, control and opportunity, addressing
    wider needs (from browsing to interconnection of billions of smart devices with
    new real-time requirements) and which is more secure and trusted by design as
    a critical infrastructure for society and business. 1.5 Conclusion The digital
    revolution has only just started – and it is speeding up. Technology is entering
    into a critical phase, where connectivity and intelligence will permeate all areas
    of the physical world, with profound economic and social effects. Europe must
    maintain a leading position in the digital world and ensure that everyone whether
    businesses, public sector and citizens, can benefit from it. The European Commission
    has just published its proposal for the next EU budget for 2021–2027 [5], where
    there is a substantial focus on an ambitious investment in digital to make this
    a reality. This proposal includes a 60% increase in budget for Horizon Europe,
    the next EU Framework Programme for Research and innovation, as well as a proposed
    new programme, i.e. the Digital Europe Programme with a EUR 9 billion funding
    to support the large scale uptake of digital technologies, including digital skills.
    IoT and its future evolution is central to many of these efforts and Europe can
    take the lead in realising its potential. References Digital Single Market – The

    2. Future Trends in IoT Joël Bacquet, Rolf Riemenschneider and Peter Wintlev-Jensen
    European Commission, Belgium 2.1 Introduction The Next Generation Internet (NGI)
    initiative [1] aims at maintaining the European lead in advanced network infrastructures
    and fully exploit the opportunities offered by the connection to the physical
    work i.e the Internet of Things (IoT), powered by advanced computing capabilities
    and data infrastructure. The NGI and its link to IoT has to be at the service
    of people, industry and society, addressing present and specific societal challenges,
    combined with artificial intelligence (AI), secure transactions, sovereignty,
    edge computing, interactive technologies and social media, as depicted in Figure
    2.1. Every technological design has to focus on making data and components easy
    to use and profitable in an open and democratic way to every single user. Figure
    2.1 NGI Key Pillars. IoT technologies and applications bring fundamental changes
    in individuals’ and society’s view of how technology and business work in the
    world, and it is therefore an essential element of the Next Generation Internet.
    IoT is seen today as a disruptive technology for enabling new opportunities and
    triggering new services and applications. However, collecting massive amounts
    of data in everyday life poses huge challenges for the user to keep control of
    his data in terms of managing access, sharing and protection. Additionally, one
    of Europe’s greatest challenges is to keep the sovereignty of the underlying core
    infrastructure that computes and stores sensitive information, and protect IoT
    devices from misuse. The societal potential of IoT is extraordinary: better use
    of natural resources through smart farming, better food quality through devices
    enabling food traceability and control, better human health through devices linked
    to remote medicine and independent living, lower carbon emissions from autonomous
    driving and smart logistics, fewer accidents relying on connected driving, smart
    cities through smart use of massive data generated from a multitude of new sensors
    in a city. The scope of this chapter is to review novel IoT concepts that have
    been gathered from groups of experts in different fora, including specific workshops
    organised by the European Commission, inputs the European Research Cluster on
    the Internet of Things (IERC), the Alliance for Internet of Things Innovation
    (AIOTI) and the IoT-European Platforms Initiative (IoT-EPI) cluster. 2.2 Key Technological
    Game Changers for IoT Novel IoT architecture, platforms and solutions will emerge
    and will integrate new enabling technologies such as AI, secure Distributed Ledger
    Technologies (DLTs), or advanced communication networks, in order to meet new
    user requirements for performance, quality of services, trust and user control
    data. These IoT architectures, platforms and solutions will rely on the following
    game changers: Next generation IoT devices; Edge computing; Data-centric architectures;
    Community-driven business models; and A resilient and reliable infrastructure.
    Towards Next Generation IoT devices. The IoT platform development will move in
    the next phase with the emergence of tactile interface based on human-centric
    sensing and actuating, augmented and virtual reality combined with new IoT end-point
    capabilities capturing contextual environment. Interactive and conversational
    IoT platforms will emerge with innovative user interfaces interfering with things
    and humans. These interactive platforms will enable real-time control, physical
    (haptic) experiences, interactive, context aware, event-driven IoT services with
    more intelligence at the edge. In supporting trust and security, information flows
    stay close to the user, decisions are taken at the point of interest, where data
    is collected and locally processed. For this to happen, the applications need
    to combine edge computing, IoT and mobile autonomous systems using AI technologies
    as functionality enablers. Towards edge computing, shifting computing and data
    processing close to the source of data. The usual approach in most current IoT
    solutions is to execute data crunching in the cloud. In many scenarios this is
    the most suitable approach due to distributed nature of data collection. However,
    the value generated by many IoT devices decreases over time (e.g. for a thermostat
    control). With billions of IoT devices, it does not make sense to store all data
    in the cloud, but to limit data transfer to the cloud and store only information
    that is necessary to avoid data deluge. There are scenarios in which significant
    amount of data is collected at one location and the output of that local data
    processing is used to control a local process. In such cases, edge processing
    approach is desirable over processing in the cloud. For instance, this approach
    will require more computational capacity at device and gateway level to meet real-time
    requirements, preserve privacy and reduce the attack surface towards IoT devices
    by keeping most sensitive data local. This approach will imply a disruption from
    the vertical silo approach promoted by current commercial solutions, where all
    data are captured in cloud repositories and then fed back to the user. One of
    the most pertinent research tracks for edge computing will be to set the confidence
    level from information gathered from a cloud server, aggregated data from federated
    clouds and/or information retrieved from the internet. In the times of fake news,
    whilst experiencing novel possibilities of aggregating and manipulating data using
    AI, it poses unprecedented challenges for users and connected systems to set the
    appropriate confidence or criticality level of any external information. It remains
    a challenge for any future AI systems to make transparent how knowledge has been
    elicited that relies on trusted sources and algorithms. In contrast, edge computing
    novel architecture should support more decentralized decision and action support
    system available directly at the device level. In addition, edge computing solutions
    can create partial views on an environment to facilitate the decision-making process,
    perform data pruning, processing, anonymization, etc. Towards data-centric architectures,
    dealing with the exploding volume of data generated across the different application
    fields and relying on AI techniques for pre-processing of data. Data storage and
    data flow will stress capabilities of the IoT platforms, mainly due to the large
    number of devices and objects, with the need of storing, processing and exchanging
    large amount of data in due time. Data storage is directly linked with security
    and privacy components, and data markets, including the availability for the regular
    citizen and not only corporations and stakeholders, other than with Data Sovereignty
    (subject to the laws of the country in which data is retrieved and located). The
    application of AI (mainly machine learning) across the whole IoT pipeline will
    have its roots in the cloud but will have to be deployed at the edge level, embedded
    in the things or the gateways to meet time constraints. An IoT data centre like
    the IBM Watson will be capable of re/defining experience and learning, detecting
    recurring patterns and systematic failures, in particular it will be able to adapt
    a holistic risk assessment of a system state in a complex environment. As said,
    critical functions have to be replicated and delegated to a local agent that ensures
    the functioning of a system even if it is oﬄine. On the application/services side,
    AI-powered digital agents can act on behalf of the end users, interact with the
    most appropriate sensors and access the data related to the users’ current activities.
    Up to an extent, these agents can act autonomously and proactively, for a seamless
    bridging of the real and digital world. Real-time intelligence provided by such
    lightweight agents would enable smart devices to have better understanding of
    their surroundings, the user’s conditions and allow them to behave accordingly.
    Towards community-driven business models ensuring security and privacy, building
    on DLTs. Novel business models and services increasingly built on social networks
    that are associated with daily life needs like mobility, shopping or home care,
    might be linked to a building, a quartier or city. We have seen success stories
    in the economy, like Uber, Airbnb or eBay, that have grown exponentially and that
    build on the fundamentals of a sharing economy. These peer-to-peer (P2P) marketplaces
    are driven by common interest and shared values. In order to secure and enable
    growth of those P2P platforms, scale and secure technologies for authentication,
    authorization and accounting must evolve from isolated platforms to an ecosystem
    of connected platforms. DLT enables autonomy and ultimately, secures machine-to-machine
    (M2M) transactions without a central platform provider. Also, DLT can be a solution
    to manage the certificates for access to information from objects, including personal
    data, as well as smart contracts enabling new business models for P2P platform
    services. Things like money, loyalty points, intellectual property, certificates
    or even identity, can be sent across the globe, safely, (almost) instantly and
    without the need for a middle man/intermediary. Security and privacy mechanisms,
    based on blockchains or any other DLT, may provide new benefits and possibilities
    to the individual users to effectively and securely manage their personal data
    space, like authenticating the origin of the data and allowing the use of the
    data for specific stakeholders and applications, allowing the control of the re-selling
    of the data. The creation of micro-contracts and using cryptocurrencies may support
    the final benefit or revenues to the users. Traditional industrial sectors like
    energy, transport, or food chains may be transformed through P2P platform services,
    with an impact detrimental to today’s business models. It remains a challenge
    and obligation not to ignore but to embrace P2P platforms that contribute to the
    growth of a community and demonstrate the opportunities of emerging technologies
    like DLT or blockchains for IoT platforms. DLT holds promise to mediate interactions
    in future decentralized IoT environments, but next-generation DLT solutions are
    needed to make this a reality. Current distributed ledgers seem not to be scalable
    and had difficulties to handle a high transaction load. Towards resilient and
    reliable infrastructure. Future IoT services and applications will require infrastructures
    to support IoT device connectivity, data streaming and security with new requirements
    for service quality and reliability. Decentralized data governance and data security
    will be possible thanks to distributed architectures using DLT, where the control
    of personal data is significantly improved. But a trusted DLT platform will require
    beyond a protocol scalable, performant infrastructure and shared governance to
    establish trust and security. Another challenge for the infrastructure will be
    the treatment of IoT traffic which will be a major research and deployment issue,
    to increase availability, resilience and use of data coming from IoT. The emerging
    trends are related to distributed architectures, software defined technologies
    and new networking capabilities. 2.3 Interoperability IoT environments are rather
    complex with heterogeneous physical devices supporting various communication protocols,
    while they are possibly connected to an intermediary gateway and then to their
    virtual representations (i.e. services) running on different platforms. Thus,
    it is possible to interact with a single IoT device in many ways using its varied
    interfaces and representations. IoT platforms require interoperability on multiple
    levels, which means finding the characteristic functionalities of each layer and
    defining meta-protocols that can be mapped on the ones used in the platforms (i.e.
    on the level of syntactic interoperability, the characteristic functionality is
    resource access). A lot of work has been done in this field in particular in the
    IoT-EPI, which focuses mainly on architectures and semantic interoperability [2].
    As an example, the INTER-IoT project [3] has defined an IoT multi-layer approach
    to provide semantic interoperability, as illustrated in Figure 2.2. Figure 2.2
    Inter-IoT Multi-layer architecture. Nevertheless, research on a layer-oriented
    approach is still needed to address tighter interoperability at all layers of
    IoT systems (device, network, middleware, application, data and semantics) with
    a strong focus on guaranteeing trust, privacy and security aspects within this
    interoperability. The demands of the future internet, including future IoT applications
    and services, will require a much larger object space, resource efficient implementation
    in devices, object interaction across so far siloed application spaces, as well
    as support for intelligent and trusted mechanisms for service provision. Standards
    have to support interoperability for any object to be seamlessly connected. New
    connected objects allow users to optimize functions in their daily life (to be
    safe, for entertainment and comfort, or daily activity support). This requires
    that objects seamlessly and securely connect, but that they are also identified
    due to their functionality. On semantic interoperability, despite several efforts
    to find common ontologies to be reused and different standardization efforts (e.g.
    SAREF, W3C or ETSI), in a real interoperability environment, new ontologies have
    to be defined, to address specific deployment. Efforts have to be devoted to semantic
    translation or alignment in order to provide an easy support for ontology matching
    between IoT platforms. Work needs to continue on common vocabularies, data models
    and semantic mapping techniques that could become the key technologies for semantic
    interoperability via common efforts on the abstract core model for IoT domains.
    Under the new Focus Area on Digitisation in the Horizon 2020 Work Programme 2018–2020,
    the European Commission calls for a pilot on Interoperable Smart Homes and Grids
    under call DT-ICT-10-2018-19. IoT is expected to enable a seamless integration
    of home appliances with related home comfort and building automation services
    allowing to match user needs with the management of distributed energy across
    the grid. Through Digitisation of Energy, there will be much more assets connected
    to the grid, which are intelligently communicating with the grid. This comes with
    all kinds of complexities in terms of interoperability, but mainly due to a lot
    of different IoT platforms coming from different manufacturers and sectors, like
    building automation, heating, electrical vehicle charging, appliances, etc. The
    energy sectoral ecosystem finds itself in a transition period that entails the
    grid operator, the energy business and services, and the changing role of a consumer
    or prosumer. The interconnectivity of different systems and assets will become
    very powerful through IoT platforms if interoperability can be achieved across
    federated systems that enable the integration of data and novel services. 2.4
    Boosting IoT Innovation and Deployment In future IoT solutions, the importance
    of data will prevail and further grow. Measuring the economic value of data is
    a key challenge, focusing on the understanding of the economic value of the data
    instances and streams in different IoT infrastructure deployment use-cases. The
    openness of localized sensor data will provide new means to boost the IoT market.
    Providers of such data will experience new revenue streams. Moreover, new form
    of marketplaces will be created; that of local data marketplaces, which will also
    boost innovation. Especially when considering use cases like smart cities, smart
    transportation or smart grids, where sensing information is characterized by lot
    of heterogeneous and sensitive data sources, the real benefit from such kind of
    data markets is seized when data is shared across private, public and industrial
    value chains. Apart from technology enablers for data marketplaces like DLT, the
    European Commission favours communities and ecosystems that provide incentives
    for sharing data on any kind of assets or resources to create an added value through
    new services and applications (e.g. shared parking, car-sharing, P2P energy, etc.).
    It remains a challenge for public decision makers to adapt the regulatory framework
    for new data economy towards a Free Flow of Data, harmonization of data access
    across borders, data protection and portability in support of a Digital Single
    Market. The IoT platform centric point of view will evolve to an ecosystem of
    platforms with IoT platforms, IoT nodes and sets of IoT things. Instead of IoT
    platform companies trying to lock-in their customers through closed system approaches,
    thus creating complex integration links, new common and open interoperation among
    all these structures will be needed. Ecosystem governance is necessary for controlling
    different degrees of interoperation and for managing the access to data and services
    across the whole ecosystem, especially for the use of personal data. 2.5 Conclusion
    IoT is a key technology transversal to all sectors of activity and will be fundamental
    for the NGI initiative. The next generation of IoT will build on a new generation
    set of devices and systems that will make use of new infrastructure enhancements,
    better sensing and actuating capabilities, end-to-end semantic knowledge, more
    powerful computation capabilities on the edge, intrinsic adoption of AI from the
    edge to the backbone, and the ability to set-up new relationships (like smart
    contracts, context awareness or intelligent behaviour) among things, services
    and people, while respecting the human-centric concerns in terms of privacy, security,
    openness, sustainability and control of personal data. The inputs collected from
    the relevant workshops and IoT stakeholder communities are key inspiring sources
    on the strategic directions needed to support future research, development and
    innovation of IoT in the context of the NGI initiative. These sources are major
    inputs to the elaboration of future research and innovation work programmes within
    Horizon 2020 and beyond. References The Next Generation Internet initiative, online

    Internet of Things (IoT) and the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) are evolving
    towards the next generation of Tactile IoT/IIoT, which will bring together hyperconnectivity,
    edge computing, Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) and Artificial Intelligence
    (AI). Future IoT applications will apply AI methods, such as machine learning
    (ML) and neural networks (NNs), to optimize the processing of information, as
    well as to integrate robotic devices, drones, autonomous vehicles, augmented and
    virtual reality (AR/VR), and digital assistants. These applications will engender
    new products, services and experiences that will offer many benefits to businesses,
    consumers and industries. A more human-centred perspective will allow us to maximise
    the effects of the next generation of IoT/IIoT technologies and applications as
    we move towards the integration of intelligent objects with social capabilities
    that need to address the interactions between autonomous systems and humans in
    a seamless way. 3.1 Next Generation Internet of Things The IoT is enabled by heterogeneous
    technologies used to sense, collect, store, act, process, infer, transmit, create
    notifications of/for, manage and analyse data. The combination of emergent technologies
    for information processing and distributed security, e.g. AI, IoT, DLTs and blockchains,
    brings new challenges in addressing distributed IoT architectures and distributed
    security mechanisms that form the foundation of improved and, eventually, entirely
    new products and services. New systems in the IoT that use smart solutions with
    embedded intelligence, connectivity and processing capabilities for edge devices
    rely on real-time analysis of information at the edge. These new IoT systems are
    moving away from centralized cloud-computing solutions towards distributed intelligent
    edge computing systems. Traditional centralized cloud computing solutions are
    perfect for non-real-time applications that require high data rates, huge amounts
    of storage and processing power, are not strict to very low latency, cost money
    and can be used for heavy data analytics and AI processing jobs. On the other
    hand, distributed edge solutions introduce computations at the edge of the network
    where information is generated and are perfect for real-time services, since they
    exhibit very low latency (in the order of milliseconds) and can be used for simple
    ultra-fast analytics jobs. The collection, storage and processing of data at the
    edge of the network in a distributed way contributes also to the increased privacy
    of the user data, since no personal information is stored in backbone centralized
    servers and each user retains the full control of his data. Figure 3.1 Next Generation
    IoT Hyperconnected: 6As and 6Cs. IoT developments during recent years have been
    characterized by attributes that can be “labelled” the 6As: Anything (any device),
    to be transferred from/to Anyone (anybody), located Any place (anywhere), at Any
    time (any context), using the most appropriate physical path from Any path (any
    network) available between the sender and the recipient based on performance and/or
    economic considerations, to provide Any service (any business). The IoT paradigm
    is evolving and entire IoT ecosystems are now built upon innervation elements
    known as the 6Cs: Collect (heterogeneity of devices of various complexities and
    intelligence, that enhance the real-time collection of data generated from the
    connections of devices and information), Connect (ubiquitous distributed connections
    of heterogeneous devices and information, where the connections are the foundational
    component of the IoT), Cache (stored information in the distributed IoT computing/processing
    environment), Compute (advanced processing and computation of data and information),
    Cognize (information analytics, insights, extractions, real-time AI processing
    and Create (the creation of new interactions, services, experiences, business
    models and solutions). This is illustrated in Figure 3.1. Figure 3.2 Next Generation
    IoT evolution. The IoT transforms everyday physical objects in the surrounding
    environment into ecosystems of information that enrich people’s lives [97]. The
    IoT not only influences the future Internet landscape, with implications for security
    and privacy (personal freedoms), but it could also help to reduce the digital
    divide. The increased dependence of AI and the IoT on the connectivity network,
    together with the severity of security challenges, increases their vulnerabilities
    in parallel. The ongoing and future success of the Internet as a driver for economic
    and social innovation is linked to how new technologies will respond to these
    threats. Combining AI with the IoT promises new opportunities, ranging from new
    services and breakthroughs in science to the augmentation of human intelligence
    and its convergence with the physical and digital world. The next generation of
    IoT-combining technologies as presented in Figure 3.3, such as AI, DLTs, hyperconnectivity,
    distributed edge computing, end-to-end distributed security and autonomous systems
    – robotics will require increased human-centred safeguards and prioritised ethical
    considerations in their design and deployment. Next generation IoT evolution is
    illustrated in Figure 3.2. The IoT is bridging the gap between the virtual, digital
    and physical worlds by bringing together people, processes, data and things while
    generating knowledge through IoT applications and platforms. IoT achieves this
    addressing security, privacy and trust issues across these dimensions in an era
    where technology, computing power, connectivity, network capacity and the number
    and types of smart devices are all expected to increase. In this context, IoT
    is driving the digital transformation. Figure 3.3 Next Generation IoT technology
    convergence. As a global concept, the IoT requires a common high-level definition.
    The IoT is a paradigm involving multidisciplinary activities and has different
    meanings at different levels of abstraction through the information and knowledge
    value chain. Considering the wide background and the number of required technologies,
    from sensing devices, communication subsystems, data aggregation and pre-processing
    to object instantiation and finally service provision, proposing an unambiguous
    definition of the “IoT” is non-trivial. IoT is defined [60] as a dynamic global
    network infrastructure with self-configuring capabilities based on standard and
    interoperable communication protocols where physical and virtual ‘things’ have
    identities, physical attributes, and virtual personalities using intelligent interfaces
    for seamlessly integrating into the information network. In the IoT, ‘things’
    are expected to become active participants in business, information and social
    processes where they are enabled to interact and communicate among themselves
    and with the environment by exchanging data and information ‘sensed’ about the
    environment, while reacting autonomously to the ‘real/physical world’ events and
    influencing it by running processes that trigger actions and create services with
    or without direct human intervention. Interfaces in the form of services facilitate
    interactions with these ‘smart things’ over the Internet, query and change their
    state and any information associated with them, considering security and privacy
    issues. In the context of industry digitisation, IoT/IIoT brings together the
    primary characteristics of Next Generation Internet (NGI) technology, mobile systems
    and ubiquitous connectivity with those of industrial control systems, sensing,
    actuating and control capabilities. Interoperability, platform integration and
    standardisation are essential for digitising industry applications. IoT/IIoT and
    industrial control systems have three quality dimensions – integrity, availability
    and confidentiality – which are essential for implementing applications in industrial
    vertical domains and across different vertical domains. Whereas the IoT emerged
    as an add-on to the already existing Internet, it is important to consider the
    emergence of an NGI where the IoT is deeply embedded and no longer a mere add-on.
    IoT devices and systems that build on enhanced sensing/actuating, reasoning capabilities
    and computational power at the edge are already becoming a natural part of an
    integrated NGI rather than simple extensions of the Internet. The IoT is promising
    in a hyperconnected world, where every object has the capability to sense its
    surrounding environment, transmit information, provide feedback or trigger an
    action through the application of AI processes in a distributed architecture with
    processing, intelligence and connectivity at the edge. It is becoming increasingly
    clear that the main benefit of IoT systems is the network effect, i.e., when different
    systems are integrated. As many different systems become integrated, the IoT must
    face complex interoperability challenges before it can create real cross-domain
    services with seamless movements of devices and data. However, a lack of stable
    implementations and the variety of devices available undermine the promised interoperability.
    A standard solution for IoT interoperability could result in several implementations
    whose effectiveness would need to be verified and certified; current practices
    for interoperability testing require different vendors, developers and service
    providers to participate in physical events. The integration of hyperconnectivity,
    IoT/IIoT, AI, DLTs and edge computing requires the NGI to address these challenges.
    This implies the identification of the right business models and the proper governance
    framework, which support data movement across systems and identify liability in
    case of any issues, as well as an understanding of the means to overcome the current
    technical fragmentation in the IoT. In many applications, the centralised services
    of cloud computing are being replaced with IoT edge-distributed solutions based
    on AI methods. With multi-access edge computing (MEC) and ubiquitous hyperconnectivity
    capabilities (5G and beyond), the IoT is now able to process large amounts of
    information, resulting from its connections, to be used for intelligent purposes
    by advanced AI algorithms, which can learn with less data and require fewer processing
    and memory resources. The cognitive transformation of IoT applications also allows
    the use of optimised solutions for individual applications and the integration
    of immersive technologies, i.e., virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR).
    Such concepts transform the way individuals and robots interact with one another
    and with IoT platform systems. 3.2 Next Generation IoT Strategic Research and
    Innovation The Internet of Things European Research Cluster (IERC) concentrates
    the know-how regarding scientific production and research capacity for the Internet
    of Things in Europe; the IERC brings together EU-funded projects with the aim
    of defining a common vision for IoT technology and addressing European research
    challenges. The rationale is to leverage the large potential for IoT-based capabilities
    and promote the use of the results of existing projects to encourage the convergence
    of ongoing work; ultimately, the endpoints are to tackle the most important deployment
    issues, transfer research and knowledge to products and services, and apply these
    to real IoT applications. The objectives of IERC are to provide information on
    research and innovation trends, and to present the state of the art in terms of
    IoT technology and societal analysis, to apply developments to IoT-funded projects
    and to market applications and EU policies. The final goal is to test and develop
    innovative and interoperable IoT solutions in areas of industrial and public interest.
    The IERC objectives are addressed as an IoT continuum of research, innovation,
    development, deployment, and adoption. Every year, the IERC launches its Strategic
    Research and Innovation Agenda (SRIA), which is the outcome of discussions involving
    project representatives/coordinators, a collective group of experts from different
    stakeholders representing the different domains where IoT is relevant and industry
    representation that is not necessarily limited to IERC community participation.
    Such industry participation includes the Alliance for the Internet of Things Innovation
    (AIOTI), an industry-lead association representing the industrial European and
    non-European members. Enabled by the activities of the IERC, IoT is bridging physical,
    digital, virtual, and human spheres through networks, connected processes, and
    data, and turning them into knowledge and action, so that everything is connected
    in a large, distributed network. New technological trends bring intelligence and
    cognition to IoT technologies, protocols, standards, architecture, data acquisition,
    and analysis, all with a societal, industrial, business, and/or human purpose
    in mind. The IoT technological trends are presented in the context of integration
    of hyperconnectivity, digital transformation, actionable data, information and
    knowledge. The IERC works to provide a framework that supports the convergence
    of IoT architecture approaches; it will do so while considering the vertical definition
    of the architectural layers, end-to-end security, and horizontal interoperability.
    The SRIA is developed with the support of a European-led community of interrelated
    projects and their stakeholders, all of whom are dedicated to the innovation,
    creation, development, and use of IoT technology. Since the release of the first
    version of the SRIA, we have witnessed active research on several IoT topics.
    Updated releases of this SRIA build incrementally on previous versions [60, 62,
    88] and highlight the main research topics associated with the development of
    IoT-enabling technologies, infrastructure, and applications [87]. The research
    activities include the IoT European Platforms Initiative (IoT-EPI) program that
    includes the research and innovation consortia that are working together to deliver
    an IoT extended into a web of platforms for connected devices and objects. The
    platforms support smart environments, businesses, services and persons with dynamic
    and adaptive configuration capabilities. The goal is to overcome the fragmentation
    of vertically-oriented closed systems, architectures and application areas and
    move towards open systems and platforms that support multiple applications. IoT-EPI
    is funded by the European Commission (EC) with EUR 50 million over three years
    (2016–2018) [67]. The research and innovation items addressed and discussed in
    the task forces of the IoT-EPI program, the IERC activity chains, and the AIOTI
    working groups form the basis of the IERC SRIA to address the roadmap of IoT technologies
    and applications; this is done in line with the major economic and societal challenges
    underscored by the EU 2020 Digital Agenda [87]. The IoT European Large-Scale Pilots
    Programme [68] includes the innovation consortia that are collaborating to foster
    the deployment of IoT solutions in Europe through integration of advanced IoT
    technologies across the value chain, demonstration of multiple IoT applications
    at scale and in a usage context, and as close as possible to operational conditions.
    The programme projects are targeted and goal driven initiatives that propose IoT
    approaches to specific real-life industrial/societal challenges. They are autonomous
    entities that involve stakeholders from supply side to demand side, and contain
    all the technological and innovation elements, the tasks related to the use, application
    and deployment as well as the development, testing and integration activities.
    The scope of IoT European Large-Scale Pilots Programme is to foster the deployment
    of IoT solutions in Europe through integration of advanced IoT technologies across
    the value chain, demonstration of multiple IoT applications at scale and in a
    usage context, and as close as possible to operational conditions. Specific Pilot
    considerations include: Mapping of pilot architecture approaches with validated
    IoT reference architectures such as IoT-A enabling interoperability across use
    cases. Contribution to strategic activity groups that were defined during the
    LSP kick-off meeting to foster coherent implementation of the different LSPs.
    Contribution to clustering their results of horizontal nature (interoperability
    approach, standards, security and privacy approaches, business validation and
    sustainability, methodologies, metrics, etc.). The IoT European Large-Scale Pilots
    Programme includes projects promoting the IoT innovation by means of market applications
    based on services’ demand and impact in the European market, technology readiness
    and socioeconomic interests in European society. The IoT European Large-Scale
    Pilots Programme is funded by the European Commission (EC) with EUR 100 million
    over three years (2017–2019) [68]. The IoT is creating new opportunities and providing
    competitive advantages for businesses in both current and new markets. IoT-enabling
    technologies have changed the things that are connected to the Internet, especially
    with the emergence of Tactile Internet and mobile moments (i.e., the moments in
    which a person or an intelligent device pulls out a device to receive context-aware
    service in real-time). Such technology has been integrated into connected devices,
    which range from home appliances and automobiles to wearables and virtual assistants.
    The IoT technologies and applications will bring fundamental changes in individuals’
    and society’s views of how technology and business work in the world. A human-centred
    IoT environment requires tackling new technological trends and challenges. This
    has an important impact on the research activities that need to be accelerated
    without compromising the thoroughness, rigorous testing and needed time required
    for commercialisation. A hyperconnected society is converging with a consumer-industrial-business
    Internet that is based on hyperconnected IoT environments. The latter require
    new IoT systems architectures that are integrated with network architecture (a
    knowledge-centric network for IoT), a system design and horizontal interoperable
    platforms that manage things that are digital, automated and connected, functioning
    in real-time, having remote access and being controlled based on Internet-enabled
    tools. Research and development are tightly coupled. Thus, the IoT research topics
    should address technologies that bring benefits, value, context and efficient
    implementation in different use cases and examples across various applications
    and industries. IoT devices require integrated electronic component solutions
    that contain sensors/actuators, processing and communication capabilities. These
    IoT devices make sensing ubiquitous at a very low cost, resulting in extremely
    strong price pressure on electronic component manufacturers. The next generation
    IoT/IIoT developments, including human-centred approaches, are interlinked with
    the evolution of enabling technologies (AI, connectivity, security, etc.) that
    require strengthening trustworthiness with electronic identities, service and
    data/knowledge portability across applications and IoT platforms. This ensures
    an evolution towards distributed IoT architectures with better efficiency, scalability,
    end-to-end security, privacy and resilience. The virtualization of functions and
    rule-based policies will allow for free, fair flow of data and sharing of data
    and knowledge, while protecting the integrity and privacy of data. Vertical industry
    stakeholders will become more and more integrated in the connectivity-network
    value chain. Moreover, unified, heterogeneous and distributed applications, combining
    information and operation technologies (IT and OT), will expose the network to
    more diverse and specific demands. Intelligent/cognitive connectivity networks
    provide multiple functionalities, including physical connectivity that supports
    transfer of information and adaptive features that adapt to user needs (context
    and content). These networks can efficiently exploit network-generated data and
    functionality in real-time and can be dynamically instantiated close to where
    data are generated and needed. The dynamically instantiated functions are based
    on intelligent algorithms that enable the network to adapt and evolve to meet
    changing requirements and scenarios and to provide context- and content- suitable
    services to users. The intelligence embedded in the network allows the functions
    of IoT platforms to be embedded within the network infrastructure and data, and
    the knowledge generated by the intelligent connectivity network and by the users/things
    can be used by the network itself. This knowledge can be taken advantage of in
    applications outside of the network. The connectivity networks for next generation
    IoT/IIoT are transforming into intelligent platform infrastructures that will
    provide multiple functionalities and will be ubiquitous, pervasive and more integrated,
    further embedding telephone/cellular, Internet/data and knowledge networks. Advanced
    technologies are required for the NGI to provide the energy-efficient, intelligent,
    scalable, high-capacity and high-connectivity performance required for the intelligent
    and dynamically adaptable infrastructure to provide digital services – experiences
    that can be developed and deployed by humans and things. In this context, the
    connectivity networks provide energy efficiency and high performance as well as
    the edge-network intelligence infrastructure using AI, Machine Learning (ML),
    Deep Learning (DL), Neural Networks (NNs) and other techniques for decentralised
    and automated network management, data analytics and shared contexts and knowledge.
    Standardisation and solutions are needed for designing products to support multiple
    IoT standards or ecosystems and research on new standards and related APIs. Summarizing,
    although huge efforts have been made within the IERC community for the design
    and development of IoT technologies, the continuously changing IoT landscape and
    the introduction of new requirements and technologies creates new challenges or
    raise the need to revisit existing well-acknowledged solutions. Thus, below is
    a list of the main open research challenges for the future of IoT: IoT architectures
    considering the requirements of distributed intelligence at the edge, cognition,
    artificial intelligence, context awareness, tactile applications, heterogeneous
    devices, end-to-end security, privacy, trust, safety and reliability. IoT systems
    architectures integrated with network architecture forming a knowledge-centric
    network for IoT. Intelligence and context awareness at the IoT edge, using advanced
    distributed predictive analytics. IoT applications that anticipate human and machine
    behaviours for social support. Tactile Internet of Things applications and supportive
    technologies. Augmented reality and virtual reality IoT applications. Autonomics
    in IoT towards the Internet of Autonomous Things. Inclusion of robotics in the
    IoT towards the Internet of Robotic Things. Artificial intelligence and machine
    learning mechanisms for automating IoT processes. Distributed IoT systems using
    securely interconnected and synchronized mobile edge IoT clouds. Stronger distributed
    and end-to-end holistic security solutions for IoT, preventing the exploitation
    of IoT devices for launching cyber-attacks, i.e., remotely controlling IoT devices
    for launching Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Stronger privacy solutions,
    considering the requirements of the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
    [80] for protecting the users’ personal data from unauthorized access, employing
    protective measures (such as Privacy Enhancing Technologies – PETs) as closer
    to the user as possible. Cross-layer optimization of networking, analytics, security,
    communication and intelligence. IoT-specific heterogeneous networking technologies
    that consider the diverse requirements of IoT applications, mobile IoT devices,
    delay tolerant networks, energy consumption, bidirectional communication interfaces
    that dynamically change characteristics to adapt to application needs, dynamic
    spectrum access for wireless devices, and multi-radio IoT devices. Adaptation
    of software defined radio and software defined networking technologies in the
    IoT. 3.2.1 Digitisation Digitisation is being utilised in many fields, and, as
    time passes, the influence of digital approaches and techniques is becoming more
    apparent in several industrial sectors. Buildings and cities are becoming smarter
    the larger the number of digital services they offer, vehicles are becoming self-driving,
    design processes are becoming highly efficient and objects and spaces can be visualised
    before being materialized thanks to the available digital information. Devices
    with embedded sensors featuring complex logic are scattered everywhere; they measure
    light, noise, sound, humidity and temperature and are empowered to communicate
    with each other to form IoT ecosystems. A common element in all of these developments
    is that digitisation creates a great amount of information. A considerable part
    of this information reveals how objects work internally and as elements of more
    complex setups. Accordingly, many innovative technological installations offer
    creative solutions concerning how to collect and process this information and
    how to take necessary action. The challenge with this information is related to
    how things interact with each other and with the environment while exhibiting
    behaviour that is often similar to human behaviour. This behaviour cannot be accurately
    handled by robots, drones, etc., so this is where technologies, such as swarm
    logic and AI, come into play. Security-perceived threats almost always trigger
    interactive installations equipped to sense and react to surrounding parameters.
    Changes in these parameters can be visualised, increasing the chances of real
    threats being detected and asserted. Thanks to advanced visualisation techniques,
    the threat landscape is better defined. While security used to be primarily about
    securing information, the landscape has widened considerably. The timely transfer
    of information, threat identification, isolation and correct and traceable actions
    all rely on security protection. IoT ecosystems evolve, so too must security strategies,
    which have to account for the layered architecture, where all things, encryptions,
    communications and actions must be protected against a growing number of diverse
    attacks, whether via hardware, software or physical tampering. The IoT system
    can be seen as a group of agents with non-coordinated individual actions that
    can collectively use local information to derive new knowledge as a basis for
    some global actions. The intelligence lies both in agents (AI) and in their interactions
    (collective intelligence). At the core of swarm logic is the sharing of information
    and interactions with each other and the surroundings to derive new information.
    However, this collective intelligence is prone to a number of attacks, especially
    related to malicious nodes sending false information to influence the decision-making
    system. Thus, reputation and trust management systems should be in place to be
    able to identify malicious or misbehaving system agents/nodes and remove them
    from the system until they behave normally again. These types of attacks can be
    easily identified and corrected at the edge of the network without having to move
    all the information to the cloud. Swarm agents can locate and isolate the threat
    and then converge towards a common point of processing. This is visualised by
    depicting the real-time state of the agent’s movement. Swarm-designed security
    is inspired by nature; hence, if IoT can uncover behaviour patterns (of birds,
    ants, etc.), it may also be capable of meeting security challenges with well-functioning
    solutions. 3.2.2 Tactile IoT/IIoT The Tactile IoT/IIoT is a shift in the collaborative
    paradigm, adding human-centred perspective and sensing/actuating capabilities
    transported over the network to communications modalities, so that people and
    machines no longer need to be physically close to the systems they operate or
    interact with as they can be controlled remotely. Tactile IoT/IIoT combines ultra-low
    latency with extremely high availability, reliability and security and enables
    humans and machines to interact with their environment, in real-time, using haptic
    interaction with visual feedback, while on the move and within a certain spatial
    communication range. Faster Internet connections and increased bandwidth allow
    to increase the information garnered from onsite sensors within industrial IoT
    network. This requires new software and hardware for managing storing, analysing
    and accessing the extra data quickly and seamlessly through a Tactile IoT/IIoT
    applications. Hyperconnectivity is needed to take VR and AR to the next level
    for uniform video streaming and remote control/tactile Internet (low latency).
    The Tactile IoT/IIoT provides the capabilities to enable the delivery of real-time
    control and physical (haptic) experiences remotely. The capabilities of the Tactile
    IoT/IIoT support the creation of a personal spatial safety zone, which is able
    to interact with nearby objects also connected to the Tactile IoT/IIoT. If applied
    to traffic, in the long term, this safety zone will be able to protect drivers,
    passengers and pedestrians. Autonomous vehicles could detect safety-critical situations
    and react instantly to avoid traffic accidents and warn other objects of impending
    danger. In production environments, occupational safety levels will improve as
    production machines or robots detect and avoid the risk of harm to people in their
    vicinity [45]. A representation of the Tactile Internet of Things Model is shown
    in Figure 3.4. Figure 3.4 Tactile Internet of Things model. Source: Adapted from
    Prof Eckehard Steinbach, TU Munich. The Tactile IoT/IIoT is the next evolution
    that enables the control of the IoT/IIoT in real-time, with all human senses interacting
    with machines, by using various technologies both at the network and application
    level to enable and enhance the interaction in the cyberspace. At the edges, the
    Tactile IoT/IIoT will be enabled by the sensor/actuators and robotic “things”.
    Content and data are transmitted over a 5G network, while intelligence is enabled
    close to the user experience through mobile edge computing. At the application
    level, automation, robotics, telepresence, AR, VR and AI will be integrated in
    various IoT/IIoT use cases. The Tactile IoT/IIoT provides a medium for remote
    physical interaction in real-time, which requires the exchange of closed-loop
    information between virtual and/or real objects (i.e., humans, machines and processes).
    The IEEE P1918.1 working group defines the Tactile Internet as a “network or network
    of networks for remotely accessing, perceiving, manipulating or controlling real
    or virtual objects or processes in perceived real-time by humans or machines”
    [44]. The domains of Tactile IoT are illustrated in Figure 3.5. The Tactile Internet
    will benefit VR by providing the low-latency communication required to enable
    “Shared Haptic Virtual Environments”, where several users are physically coupled
    via a VR simulation to perform tasks that require fine-motor skills. Haptic feedback
    is a prerequisite for high-fidelity interaction, allowing the user to perceive
    the objects in the VR not only audio-visually but also via the sense of touch.
    This allows for sensitive object manipulations as required in tele-surgery, micro-assembly
    or related applications demanding high levels of sensitivity and precision. When
    two users interact with the same object, a direct force coupling brought into
    existence by the VR and the users can feel one another’s actions. High-fidelity
    interaction is only possible if the communication latency between the users and
    the VR is in the order of a few milliseconds. During these few milliseconds, the
    movements of the users need to be transmitted to the VR server, where the physical
    simulation is computed, and the result is returned to the users in the form of
    object status updates and haptic feedback. Typical update rates for the physical
    simulation and the display of haptic information are in the order of 1000 Hertz,
    which corresponds to an ideal round-trip communication latency of 1 millisecond
    (ms) [45]. Figure 3.5 Tactile Internet of Things representation. The use of 5G
    wireless communications for Tactile IoT/IIoT requires latencies of 1 ms or less.
    The speed of light in fibre is about 200 km/s. Tactile IoT/IIoT which are distributed
    over distances larger than about 200 km will require a low-latency IoT core network
    [50]. Tactile Internet has to meet a number of design requirements such as very
    low end-to-end latency of 1 ms, high reliability for real-time response, data
    security, availability and dependability of systems without violating the very
    low latency requirement due to additional encryption delays. These key design
    objectives of the Tactile Internet can only be accomplished by keeping tactile
    applications local, close to the users, which calls for a distributed (i.e., decentralized)
    service platform architecture based on cloudlets and mobile edge computing. Furthermore,
    scalable procedures at all protocol layers are needed to reduce the end-to-end
    latency from sensors to actuators. Importantly, the Tactile Internet will set
    demanding requirements for future access networks in terms of latency, reliability,
    and also capacity (e.g., high data rates for video sensors) [51]. Tactile Internet
    of Things interactions are illustrated in Figure 3.6. In the future, coworking
    with robots in IoT applications will favour geographical clusters of local production
    (“inshoring”) and will require human expertise in the coordination of the human-robot
    symbiosis with the purpose of inventing new jobs humans can hardly imagine or
    did not even know they wanted done. Fibre-wireless (FiWi) enabled Human-to-Robot
    (H2R) communications may be a stepping stone to merging mobile IoT/IIoT, and advanced
    robotics with automation of knowledge work and cloud technologies, which together
    represent the five technologies with the highest estimated potential economic
    impact in 2025 [51, 52]. Figure 3.6 Tactile Internet of Things interactions. Source:
    Adapted from 5G LAB. As presented in Figure 3.7 current Internet cannot guarantee
    new application delivery constraints. In this context the future technological
    developments of 5G as the neutral next generation World Wide Wireless Internet
    by integrating new technologies with a holistic integrated approach combining
    IPv6-based, machine-to-machine, mobile IoT, mobile edge computing, software defined
    networks (SDN), network functions virtualisation (NFV), Fringe Internet, Tactile
    IoT/IIoT, based on seamless worldwide networking interoperability and spectrum
    harmonisation need to address and solve these constrains for the new applications.
    Figure 3.7 New applications for NGI and IoT/IIoT [99]. 3.2.3 Digital Twins for
    IoT Digital twins are virtual representations of material assets. For the IoT,
    digital twins have never been trendier, as IoT vendors are using increasingly
    more advanced technology for their implementation, not least with an add-on marketing
    effect. The current solutions provided by some of the key IoT platforms have mainly
    been for the representation of physical objects, while such features as simulation,
    manipulation and optimisation are still missing. Thanks to technologies, such
    as blockchain, swarm logic and AI, digital twins now have these capabilities.
    In the pursuit of better security, digital twins can trigger and simulate threat
    scenarios in the digital world, as well as optimise the security strategy to handle
    such scenarios should they occur in the real world. The digital twin, as a virtual
    representation of the IoT’s physical object or system across its lifecycle, using
    real-time data to enable understanding, learning and reasoning, is a one element
    connecting the IoT and AI. The digital twin represents the virtual replica of
    the IoT physical device by acting like the real thing, which helps in detecting
    possible issues, testing new settings, simulating all kinds of scenarios, analysing
    different operational and behavioural scenarios and simulating various situations
    in a virtual or digital environment, while knowing that what is performed with
    that digital twin could also happen when it is done by the ‘real’ physical “thing”.
    Digital twins as part of IoT technologies and applications are being expanded
    to more applications, use cases and industries, as well as combined with more
    technologies, such as speech capabilities, AR for an immersive experience and
    AI capabilities, enabling us to look inside the digital twin by removing the need
    to go and check the ‘real’ thing. A digital twin representation is shown in Figure
    3.8. Figure 3.8 Digital Twin representation. Source: Adapted Deloitte University
    Press. Digital twins for IoT must possess at minimum the following attributes:
    Correctness – give a correct replication of the IoT ecosystem and its devices
    Completeness – updated vis a vis the functionality in the real-world system Soundness
    – exhibit only the functionality available in the real-world system Abstractness
    – free from details specific to particular implementations Expandability – adapt
    easily to emerging technologies and applications Scalability – must be able to
    operate at any scale Parameterised – accessible for analysis, design and implementation
    Reproducible – be able to replicate the same result for the same input as the
    real system. The IoT’s digital twins can expand the interface between man and
    machine through their virtual representation and advanced technologies on levels,
    such as AI and speech, which enable people and devices/machines to take actions
    based on operational data at the edge (provided by IoT devices and edge computing
    processing). 3.3 Future Internet of Things Enabling Technologies 3.3.1 Edge Computing
    By 2023, the number of cellular IoT connections is forecast to reach 3.5 billion
    worldwide. The digitisation of assets, equipment, vehicles and processes in a
    factory means that the number of connected devices will increase exponentially.
    The estimated number of connected devices needed in a typical smart factory is
    0.5 per square metre [1]. This calculation is based on potential use cases and
    assets that would benefit from a connection. This illustrates the distribution
    of cellular connectivity requirements (supporting the previously mentioned use
    cases) in a fully deployed smart factory. The share of each type of connected
    device [2] depends on whether the site has a low or high level of automation [3].
    Evolving to a higher level of automation will increasingly lead to a higher share
    of 5G connected devices. Both high bandwidth and consistently low latency are
    necessary to support large data volumes and real-time critical data, as well as
    to ensure consistent and secure communication [20]. [1] Average number based on
    data from different manufacturing sites. In dense areas, the connection density
    could be up to one connected device per square metre. [2] The exact distribution
    figures for a specific manufacturing site depend on the communication needs. [3]
    The level of automation is a continuum from manual to fully automatic operations.
    This requires change in IoT digital infrastructures. According to Gartner, for
    example, 80 percent of enterprises will have shut down their traditional data
    centre by 2025, versus 10 percent in 2018. Workload placement, which is driven
    by a variety of business needs, is the key driver of this infrastructure evolution.
    In this context, edge computing sits at the peak of Gartner’s 2018 Hype Cycle
    for Cloud Computing and there is plenty of scope for false starts and disillusionment
    before standards and best practices are settled upon, and mainstream adoption
    can proceed. Edge computing delivers the decentralized complement to today’s hyperscale
    cloud and legacy data centres. To maximize application potential and user experience,
    technology innovation leaders plan distributed computing solutions along a continuum
    from the core to the edge. According to business-to-business (B2B) analysts MarketsandMarkets,
    the edge computing market will be worth $6.72 billion by 2022, up from an estimated
    $1.47 bn in 2017 – a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 35.4 per cent. Key
    driving factors are the advent of IoT and 5G networks, an increase in the number
    of “intelligent” applications and the growing load on cloud infrastructure. Among
    the vertical segments considered by MarketsandMarkets, Telecom and IT are expected
    to have the biggest market share during the 2017–2022 forecast period. That’s
    because enterprises faced with high network load and increasing demand for bandwidth
    will need to optimize and extend their Radio Access Network (RAN) to deliver an
    efficient Mobile (or Multi-access) Edge Computing (MEC) environment for their
    apps and services. The fastest-growing segment of the edge computing market during
    the forecast period, says MarketsandMarkets, is likely to be retail: high volumes
    of data generated by IoT sensors, cameras and beacons that feed into smart applications
    will be more efficiently collected, stored and processed at the network edge,
    rather than in the cloud or an on-premises data centre [19]. The use of intelligent
    edge devices requires reducing the amount of data sent to the cloud through quality
    filtering and aggregation, while the integration of more functions into intelligent
    devices and gateways closer to the edge reduces latency. By moving intelligence
    to the edge, local devices can generate value and optimise the processing of information
    and communication. This allows for protocol consolidation by controlling the various
    ways devices can communicate with each other. There are different edge computing
    paradigms, such as transparent computing, fog computing and mobile edge computing
    (MEC). MEC emerged in the context of 5G architectures and enables an open RAN
    as well as being able to host third party applications and content at the edge
    of the network. Fog computing, fog networking or fogging is a decentralized computing
    infrastructure in which data, processing, storage and applications are distributed
    in the most logical, efficient place between the data source and the cloud. Fog
    computing extends cloud computing and services to the edge of the network, bringing
    the advantages and power of the cloud closer to where information is created and
    acted upon. In a fog environment, intelligence is in the local area network. Information
    is transmitted from endpoints to a gateway, where it is then transmitted to sources
    for processing and return transmission. In edge computing, intelligence and power
    of the edge gateway or appliance are in devices such as programmable automation
    controllers. Edge computing allows the reduction of points of failure, as each
    edge device operates independently and determines which information to store locally
    and which to send to the cloud for further analysis. Fog computing is scalable
    and offers a view of the network as multiple data points feed information into
    it. Fog computing enables high-performance, interoperability and security in a
    multi-vendor computing-based ecosystem and is focusing on resource allocation
    at the service level, while transparent computing concentrates on logically splitting
    the software stack (including OS) from the underlying hardware platform to provide
    cross-platform and streamed services for a variety of devices. One more difference
    compared to MEC is the need to support exotic I/O and accelerator aware provisioning,
    real-time, embedded targets as well as real-time networks such as Time Sensitive
    Networks (TSN), e.g., IEEE 802.1. Another edge computing technology is represented
    by CMU’s Cloudlet, which enables new classes of mobile applications that are both
    compute-intensive and latency-sensitive in an open ecosystem based on cloudlets.
    The Cloudlets have lately been transformed to Open Edge Computing [4] based on
    OpenStack [5]. Open Edge Computing has the vision that any edge node will offer
    computational and storage resources to any user in close proximity using a standardized
    mechanism. Edge computing technologies are characterized by openness, as operators
    open the networks to third parties to deploy applications and services, while
    their differences enable edge computing technologies to support broader IoT applications
    with various requirements. [4] http://openedgecomputing.org/ [5] https://www.openstack.org/
    The connectivity requirements of the manufacturing industry are matched by the
    capabilities of cellular networks. To enable smart manufacturing, there are different
    network deployment options depending on the case-by-case needs and the digitisation
    ambitions of the factory. One option is using virtualization and Dedicated Core
    Networks (DECOR) to map local private networks and virtual networks running within
    a mobile operator’s public network. A 4G and 5G network with dedicated radio base
    stations and Evolved Packet Core in-a-box can be deployed on the premises to ensure
    that traffic stays local to the site. In this case, on-premises cellular network
    deployment with local data breakout ensures that critical production data do not
    leave the premises, using Quality of Service (QoS) mechanisms to fulfil use case
    requirements and optimize reliability and latency. Critical applications can be
    executed locally, independent of the macro network, using cellular network deployment
    with edge computing [20]. The Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) standard is developed
    in the ETSI Industry Specification Group/ISG Multi-access Edge Computing (ETSI
    ISG MEC) [96]. The ETSI ISG MEC is the leading voice in standardization and industry
    alignment concerning MEC. It is a key building block in the evolution of mobile-broadband
    networks, complementing Network Function Virtualisation (NFV) and Software Defined
    Network (SDN), and is: A key enabler for IoT and mission-critical, vertical solutions
    Widely recognized as one of the key architectural concepts and technologies for
    5G Able to enable many 5G use cases without a full 5G roll-out (i.e. with 4G networks)
    Enabling a myriad of new use cases across multiple sectors as well as innovative
    business opportunities. The ETSI ISG MEC work on Phase 2 is extending the applicability
    of MEC technology and rendering MEC even more attractive to operators, vendors
    and application developers. One example of deployment is the Cloud IoT Edge that
    extends Google Cloud’s data processing and machine learning to edge devices (e.g.,
    robotic arms, wind turbines, oil rigs, etc.) so they can act on the data from
    their sensors in real-time and predict outcomes locally. Cloud IoT Edge can run
    on Android Things or Linux-based operating systems. It is composed of two runtime
    components, Edge IoT Core and Edge ML, and takes advantage of Google’s purpose-built
    hardware accelerator ASIC chip, Edge TPUTM. The Edge TPU is a purpose-built small-footprint
    ASIC chip designed to run TensorFlow Lite machine-learning models on edge devices.
    Cloud IoT Edge is the software stack that extends Google’s cloud services to IoT
    gateways and edge devices. Cloud IoT Edge a runtime component for gateway-class
    devices (with at least one CPU) to store, translate, process and extract intelligence
    from edge data, while interoperating with the rest of Google’s Cloud IoT platform
    (see Figure 3.9) [21]. Figure 3.9 How Cloud IoT Edge works [21]. Computing at
    the edge of the mobile network defines IoT-enabled customer experiences and requires
    a resilient and robust underlying network infrastructure to drive business success.
    IoT assets and devices are connected via mobile infrastructure and cloud services
    are provided to IoT platforms to deliver real-time and context-based services.
    Edge computing uses the power of local computing and different types of devices
    to provide intelligent services. Data storage, computing and control can be separated
    and distributed among the connected edge devices (servers, micro servers, gateways,
    IoT nodes, etc.). Edge computing advantages, such as improved scalability, local
    processing, contextual computing and analytics, make it well suited to IoT application
    requirements. Edge computing technologies like MEC – offering low latency, proximity,
    high bandwidth, real-time insight into radio network information and location
    awareness – enable the development of many new types of IoT applications and services
    for industrial sectors. Augmented Reality (AR) mobile applications have inherent
    collaborative properties in terms of data collection in the uplink, computing
    at the edge and data delivery in the downlink [17]. AR information requires low
    latency and a high rate of data processing in order to provide correct information
    depending on the location of the device. The processing of information can be
    performed on a local MEC server instead of a centralized server to provide the
    user experience required. IoT devices generate additional messaging on telecommunication
    networks and require gateways to aggregate messages and ensure low latency and
    security. An architecture used for leveraging MEC to collect, classify and analyse
    the IoT data streams is presented in [18]. The MEC server manages different protocols
    and distribution of messages and processes the analytics. The MEC environment
    supports the creation of new value chains and new type of ecosystems, which provide
    new opportunities for mobile operators and application and content providers.
    Information transmission costs and latency limitations of mobile connectivity
    pose challenges to many IoT applications that rely on cloud computing. Mobile
    edge computing enables IoT applications to deliver real-time and context-based
    mobile moments to users of IoT solutions, while managing the cost base for mobile
    infrastructure. The benefits are improved performance, deployment of intelligence
    and analytics at the edge, reduced overload of the communication networks, low
    latency, compliance, satisfaction of concerns related to data privacy and data
    security and reduced operational costs. Several challenges listed below, however,
    have to be addressed when considering edge-computing implementations [91]: Mobile
    edge computing provides real-time network and context information, including location,
    while giving application developers and business leaders access to cloud computing
    capabilities and a cloud service environment that is closer to their actual users.
    Mobile edge computing implementation and integration pose the challenge of providing
    a distributed architecture with improved robustness, reliability and local intelligence,
    as well as processing that enables the autonomous execution of processes, rules
    and algorithms. Mobile edge computing is an important network infrastructure component
    for blockchain. The continuous replication of “blocks” via devices on this distributed
    data centre poses a tremendous technological challenge. Mobile edge computing
    reveals one opportunity to address this challenge. The need to optimize and reduce
    connectivity, data migration and bandwidths costs associated with sending data
    to the cloud, while implementing local intelligence, processing and distributed
    storage. Edge computing solutions for avoiding intermittent connectivity, low
    bandwidth and/or high latency at the network edge considering the increased numbers
    of smart edge devices running software for machine learning or AI software Optimization
    of the communication with nodes in the intervening edge computing infrastructure.
    Regarding future IoT applications, it is expected that more of the network intelligence
    will reside closer to the source. This will push for the rise of edge cloud/fog
    and MEC-distributed architectures, as most data will be too noisy, latency-sensitive
    or expensive to be transferred to the cloud. Edge computing technologies for IoT
    require developers to address issues such as unstable and intermittent data transmission
    via wireless and mobile links, efficient distribution and management of data storage
    and computing, edge computing interfacing with the cloud computing to provide
    scalable services and, finally, mechanisms to secure IoT applications. The edge
    computing model requires a distributed architecture and needs to support various
    interactions and communication approaches to be used broader in consumer/business/industrial
    domains. To do this, it needs to provide peer-to-peer networking, edge-device
    collaboration (self-organizing, self-aware, self-healing, etc.), distributed queries
    across data stored in edge devices as well as in the cloud and temporary storage
    locations, distributed data management, (e.g., for defining where, what, when
    and how long, in relation to data storage) and information governance (e.g., information
    quality, discovery, usability, privacy, security, etc.). In this context, the
    research challenges in this area are: Open distributed edge computing architectures
    and implementations for IoT and IIoT (IT/OT convergence for IoT applications as
    traditionally the operational technologies (OT) used to manage and automate industrial
    equipment are placed at the edge of the network, while information technologies
    (IT) are more centralized). Integrated IoT distributed architecture for IT/OT
    integration to be used with new business models needed for interpreting or contextualizing

    Intelligence Artificial intelligence concerns activity devoted to making machines
    intelligent, with intelligence understood as a quality that enables an entity
    to function appropriately and with foresight in its environment [43]. Intelligent
    IoT devices are considered intelligent machines, while the collective attributes
    of a machine (i.e., computer, robot or other device) capable of performing functions,
    such as learning, decision-making or other intelligent human behaviours, are defined
    as AI. IoT-based sensor data generated in healthcare, bioinformatics, information
    sciences and policy- and decision-making in governments and enterprises can be
    processed using methods that rely on AI to provide new data insights and generate
    new types of knowledge. The benefits of both AI and the IoT can be expanded when
    the technologies are combined, both on the edge devices’ end and core servers’
    end. AI machine-learning methods can obtain insights from the data to analyse
    and predict the future connections of IoT devices in advance. AI is playing a
    starring role in the IoT because of its ability to quickly bring insights from
    data. ML offers the ability to automatically identify patterns and detect anomalies
    in the data that smart sensors and devices generate: information such as temperature,
    pressure, humidity, air quality, vibration and sound. Companies are finding that
    machine learning can provide significant advantages over traditional business
    intelligence tools for analysing IoT data, including being able to make operational
    predictions up to 20 times sooner and with greater accuracy than threshold-based
    monitoring systems [25]. Figure 3.10 Gartner’s Hype Cycle for emerging technologies
    2018. AI techniques extend machine learning strategies that can be applied to
    intelligent IoT devices for complex decisions based on detecting patterns, self-learning,
    self-healing, context-awareness and autonomous decision-making. These will involve
    and affect the future implementations of digital twin models and continuous learning
    with roles in autonomous vehicles applications, the IoRT and predictive maintenance.
    Democratized AI, defined as the possibility to put the AI techniques under the
    reach of everyone, is one of five trends, along with digitalized ecosystems, do-it-yourself
    biohacking, transparently immersive experiences and ubiquitous infrastructure,
    that is driving Gartner’s latest Hype Cycle for emerging technologies (see Figure
    3.10) [42], derived from 35 individual technologies. The five trends blur the
    lines between human and machine with the AI group containing technologies such
    as AI platform as a service (PaaS), artificial general intelligence, autonomous
    driving (Levels 4 and 5), autonomous mobile robots, conversational AI platform,
    deep neural nets, flying autonomous vehicles, smart robots and virtual assistants.
    The technologies enabling the next generation IoT are included under all five
    areas and comprise AI, edge AI, autonomous systems, blockchain, digital twins,
    augmented reality (AR), 5G, neuromorphic hardware and IoT platforms. The ubiquitous
    infrastructures of edge computing and the always-on, always-available, limitless
    infrastructure environment are enabling technologies that form the basis for the
    next generation IoT landscape. When combined, AI and IoT transform both the Internet,
    the global economy and societal interactions. Within the next decade, it is expected
    that AI and machine learning to be embedded in various forms of technology that
    incorporate information exchange, analysis and knowledge. The opportunities created
    range from new services and breakthroughs in science, to the augmentation of human
    and machine intelligence and their convergence with the digital, virtual and cyber
    worlds. The future challenges related to the delegation of decision-making to
    machines and IoT autonomous systems, lack of transparency and whether technological
    change will outpace the development of governance and policy norms need to be
    addressed and solutions must be provided. The evolution of basic forms of AI from
    assisted, augmented, autonomous to collaborative is illustrated in Figure 3.11.
    In this context, the development of software and IoT devices capable of making
    ethical judgements as part of autonomous collaborative systems is emerging. As
    IoT autonomous systems are developing and combined with the ubiquity of AI in
    applications, such as the Internet of Vehicles for driverless vehicles, artificial
    ethical agents could become a legal necessity. Figure 3.11 Artificial Intelligence
    Roadmap. The combined developments in AI and the IoT enable new ways of interacting
    with connected objects through voice or gesture, while AR and virtual reality
    (VR) are powered by data generated by the IoT. Sensor/actuator technologies, the
    IoT, AI and increased connectivity bandwidth (ubiquitous, reliable and secure
    connectivity) are pushing the development of the Tactile IoT based on the convergence
    of these technologies where the lines between the digital and the physical blur.
    The disruptive nature of AI comes from the speed, precision, and capacity of augmenting
    humanity. When AI is defined through seven outcomes as presented in Figure 3.12,
    the business value of AI projects gain meaning and can easily show business value
    through a spectrum of outcomes [54, 55]: Perception describes what is happening
    now. Notification is a way of providing answers to questions through alerts, workflows,
    reminders and other signals that help deliver additional information through combined
    manual input and machine learning. Suggestion recommends action. This is built
    on past behaviours and modifications over time that are based on weighted attributes,
    decision management and machine learning. Automation repeats recurrent actions.
    It is leveraged as machine learning matures over time and tuning takes place.
    Prediction informs what to expect. It builds on deep learning and neural networks
    to anticipate and test for behaviours. Prevention helps avoid negative outcomes.
    It applies cognitive reckoning to identify potential threats. Situational awareness
    explains what must be known immediately. It resembles mimicking human capabilities
    in decision making. AI methods to search for information in data and for learning
    from past and predict the future is illustrated in Figure 3.13. Figure 3.12 Outcomes
    of Artificial Intelligence. Source: Constellation Research. Figure 3.13 Artificial
    Intelligence methods. Companies face a difficult task when deciding which opportunities
    to pursue, among the hundreds available, but they can narrow their options through
    a structured approach. The first step involves picking an industry and identifying
    the potential for disruption within the industry, which is estimated by looking
    at the number of AI use cases, start-up equity funding, and the total economic
    impact of AI, defined as the extent to which solutions reduced costs, increased
    productivity, or otherwise benefited the bottom line in a retrospective analysis
    of various applications. The greater the economic benefit, the more likely that
    customers will pay for an AI solution. Figure 3.14 shows the data compiled for
    17 industries for AI-related metrics [46]. AI is a promising technological innovation,
    raising already high expectations for 2025. The IoT is the source of data for
    AI and machine learning applications, as fleets of connected IoT devices, autonomous
    vehicles and robots need to be automated to allow them to react to environmental
    conditions in real-time. By 2021, AI will support more than 80% of emerging technologies,
    while, in the following year, it will support more than 80% of enterprise IoT
    projects, according to Gartner. By 2020, it will create 2.3 million jobs, although
    50% of organizations will lack the relevant AI and data talent. Figure 3.14 AI
    dependency on market size, pain points, and willingness to pay across different
    industries. Source: Adapted from McKinsey & Company, [46]. While software has
    been a predominant factor in most corporate and investor interest for many years,
    hardware has become important again with the growth of AI. The cloud continues
    to be an option for various applications, not least due to its scale advantage,
    and the choice between cloud or edge solutions will depend on the IoT use cases
    and applications. Regarding cloud hardware, the market remains fragmented. The
    hardware preference of customers and suppliers vary for application-specific integrated
    circuit (ASIC) technology and graphics processing units (GPUs). The low latency
    connectivity at the edge is critical, driving the current development and growing
    role for inference at the edge. ASICs — with their superior performance per watt
    — provide a more optimized user experience, including lower power consumption
    and higher processing, for many applications. Enterprise edge is covered by several
    technologies, such as field programmable gate arrays, GPUs and ASIC technology.
    The ML and DL technology stack is divided into nine layers [46], across services,
    training, platform, interface, and hardware as presented in Figure 3.15. Figure
    3.15 Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) technology multi-layered stack.
    Source: Adapted from McKinsey & Company, [46]. Despite rather old technological
    foundations, in recent years, machine learning has brought about important progress
    for applications such as computer vision or natural language processing. It has
    also recently attracted sizeable investments with an explosion in VC money and
    a growing focus (through buy outs and investments) amongst Internet companies.
    The key AI innovations are presented Figure 3.16. The most anticipated AI applications
    for 2025 move beyond the current focus on language and vision by targeting advanced
    data analytics capacities and enabling decision-making applications. Figure 3.16

    DigiWorld. Unprecedented abilities in Data Analytics If computers are starting
    to catch up with humans in their ability to detect objects in images, applying
    deep learning to a field where algorithms are already ahead of most humans, such
    as data analytics, promises potentially momentous breakthroughs. Figure 3.17 AI
    adoption/maturity vs. value at stake. Source: Adapted from McKinsey & Company,
    [46]. Applying deep learning to data analytics enables complex pattern recognition
    and prediction. This is especially noteworthy in the case of “unsupervised training”
    machine learning, that is, when the algorithm is fed with unstructured data and
    tries to spot interesting patterns on its own. Several industries offer the strongest
    opportunities for AI: public sector, banking, retail, and automotive as presented
    in Figure 3.17. While the public sector’s prominence may seem surprising in an
    age where governments are cutting budgets, many officials see the value of AI
    in improving efficiency and efficacy, and they are willing to provide funding.
    As they plan their AI strategies, suppliers may focus their investments on potential
    consumers of AI solutions who are willing to be the first domino [46]. An important
    domain concerning the application of deep learning data analytics is the health
    sector. Using deep learning approaches can help in health record data analysis
    to improve diagnostics, risk analysis and preventive medication. Examples of health
    applications include reconstructing brain circuits, predicting the activity of
    potential drug molecules or predicting the effects of mutations in non-coding
    DNA on gene expressions. The Mount Sinai Hospital (see Figure 3.18) recently highlighted
    the potential for using unstructured deep learning in the secondary use of electronic
    health records in order to predict health status, as well as to help prevent disease
    or disability. The interest in deep learning approaches is especially strong in
    the case of traditional data analysis methodologies, which have been applied with
    limited success, as it can improve prediction results. Figure 3.18 Use of unstructured
    deep learning in the analysis of hospital patient data. Source: Nature/Mount Sinai
    Hospital. The IoT as Key Data provider for AI Access to relevant data sets (often
    derived from vertical industries) in order to train the deep learning algorithms
    will be critical. The development of the IoT can play a critical role in providing
    access to the relevant data sets for training future AI including the digital
    twin models. Shrinking computer chips and improved manufacturing techniques have
    led to cheaper and more powerful sensors. As the number of sensors employed in
    IoT ecosystems increases rapidly, so do the amounts of raw data produced, in turn
    calling for new computational models to handle this by employing intelligence
    at the edge for information processing. The new computational models need to cope
    not only with larger quantities but also with increased complexity of the raw
    data in terms of their syntax and semantics. Machine learning and deep learning
    are able to collect and process data from billions of sensors. Algorithmic developments
    in AI are coupled with increased data resources and computational demands that
    are served mainly today by cloud infrastructures. New developments to address
    AI algorithms for processing data at the edge are underway. Despite the rapid
    advances of AI in vision, speech recognition, natural language processing and
    dialog, there is still room for improvement when developing end-to-end intelligent
    systems that must encapsulate multiple competencies and deliver services in real-time
    using limited resources. In this direction, the developments are focusing on designing
    and delivering embedded and hierarchical AI solutions in the combined IoT/IIoT,
    edge and cloud computing environments that provide real-time decisions, using
    less data and computational resources, while orchestrating the access to each
    type of resource in a way that enhances the accuracy and performance of the models.
    The distributed AI concept builds on top of a hierarchy where low-level, context-agnostic
    models, which run on the IoT and on IoT devices, can dynamically feed higher-order
    models running on higher-capacity resources, so as to better capture the context
    knowledge. Due to the adoption of AI methods and techniques making use of a wide
    range of available resources (IoT/IIoT/edge/cloud), IoT applications are now able
    to offer a trade-off between accuracy and performance, depending on the overall
    requirements. Complex IoT applications allow distributed intelligence embedded
    in limited resource sensors at the edge of the network, providing an effective
    demonstrator of the potential of AI as a service model. There is a need to identify
    AI and machine learning (ML) methodologies for temporal data to build distributed
    learning systems that can scale from the IoT/IIoT to edge and cloud resources.
    The development of connected vehicles, smart cities and connected health are especially
    likely to provide access to the massive amounts of data required by deep learning
    approaches. However, other domains of IoT deployments, such as the industrial
    Internet are increasingly generating data sets that could fit the deep learning
    approach. The number of data points that manufacturing facilities generate and
    the ability to find correlations and pattern and recommend decisions among these
    IoT data could be addressed by deep learning or other AI methods approaches. AI
    and IoT/IIoT requirements for complex integrated systems In complex IoT applications,
    the same conditions will seldom apply twice to the same situation, even when they
    involve the same process; the context and the operation conditions in a specific
    environment, such as the stress and fatigue of the equipment, always contribute
    to the creation of an entirely new set of input values for the model. To cope
    with this expected richness of the model, feedback and training data need to be
    requested continuously and by a multitude of manufacturing equipment, resulting
    in a default global (and hence, cross-border) AI model. Deep learning approaches
    can aggregate the underlying model inputs and gradually build the necessary user
    and context profiles, but the models (low and higher order) need to continuously
    adapt to the influx of new data. A multi-parametric model of manufacturing equipment
    profiles requires the federation of a multitude of underlying models and data
    (functional, behavioural, environment, operational, informational, etc.), orchestrated
    in a distributed and decentralized fashion so as to ensure that the evaluation
    is happening close to the data sources (ensuring real-time reactions) in an efficient
    and collaborative fashion. Thus, the applications across industrial sectors integrating
    AI and IoT need to address a multitude of requirements in order to fulfil the
    integration of functional and non-functional attributes for such complex systems.
    The requirements for complex IoT/IIoT systems that have embedded artificial intelligence
    (AI) techniques and methods can be summarized as presented in Figure 3.19 and
    the following list: Figure 3.19 AI and IoT/IIoT requirements for complex system
    integrated systems. Explainability: Enables human users to understand the decisions
    made by AI systems and the rationale behind them. This ability will make it easier
    to track down eventual failures and assess decisions’ strengths and weaknesses.
    Ultimately, this will increase the trust in the systems’ decisions. This ability
    will have to integrate with human-computer interface techniques which are able
    to track complex reasoning processes. Availability: Enables IoT applications to
    provide data and resources in a timely manner for a set percentage of time (i.e.,
    the uptime) as well as retain their core functionality, even if the system has
    undergone a security attack. Industrial IoT applications may target mission-critical
    tasks along the production line; system outages will therefore have direct economic
    impact. In the near future, it is also envisaged that IoT systems, due to embedded
    AI, will be able to perform autonomously via online learning over their lifetime
    and remove even the downtime needed for maintenance. AI systems should be available
    in terms of integration into new applications and process steps. Trustworthiness:
    Enables IoT systems to be trusted, only allowing authenticated devices or services
    that can be uniquely identified to participate in the decision-making processes
    of the system. This makes it possible to report the source of vulnerabilities
    and inconsistencies. As more and more AI-enabled systems become connected through
    the IoT, trustworthiness becomes an indispensable requirement. Precisely due to
    the AI, trustworthiness will become multi-dimensional, far beyond verifying identity.
    Consequently, trust will no longer be ‘true’ or ‘false’, but rather about degrees
    of trustworthiness that will control the access levels of devices/users to critical
    services. Security: Enables systems to guarantee distributed end-to-end security,
    which is essential to ensure robustness against all types of attack vectors in
    the IoT. This includes securing the AI system itself as well as securing communication
    between edge computing IoT devices with encryption and authentication mechanisms
    against attacks with manipulated input data. Safety: Enables systems to protect
    persons and objects during operation. AI systems that operate physically next
    to and collaboratively with humans through robots or other machines must not exhibit
    random or unpredictable behaviour. Safety by design is essential, entailing compliance
    with relevant safety standards. Importantly, the employed AI and IoT systems must
    be robust against implausible data and operate with extremely low latency to quickly
    and appropriately react to unforeseen events (i.e., to prevent accidents). Privacy:
    Enables IoT and AI-based systems that operate on mission- and business-critical
    data to keep this data private. This entails both limiting access to and placing
    restrictions on certain types of information with the goal of preventing unauthorized
    access (confidentiality) as well as protecting data from being modified or corrupted
    without detection. Such data must therefore be processed locally at the edge and
    only leverage data available within privacy limits (smart data). Transparency:
    Enables IoT and AI-based systems to provide insight into devices and processes
    in situations such as auditing, inspections to assess vulnerabilities, or when
    security breaches arise. This may be supported by digital twins that represent
    the complete system state at any point in time. AI methods for data visualization
    can further enhance transparency and contribute to making the systems state easier
    to understand. Fairness: Enables IoT systems which embed AI technologies to support
    or automate decision processes while adhering to the same fairness and compliance
    standards as humans. Inclusiveness: Enables AI-based IoT systems to allow human
    intervention even in the most automated decision and communication processes.
    This is essential to avoid the formation of isolated non-AI capable sub-systems
    within a process, production system or supply chain. Collaboration: Enables AI-based
    IoT systems to self-organize around a common goal; for example, in the presence
    of a threat, as well as to collaborate with humans, both physically (e.g., human-robot
    collaboration) and by exchanging information (human-machine interfaces). Collaboration
    is an emergent property of complex interactions and dynamics, increasingly present
    in industry. Industry-grade AI will not be concentrated on a single device or
    system. Instead, many different AI-enabled subsystems will be distributed (distributed
    AI) across IoT nodes, embedded devices and other edge devices (embedded AI). Integration:
    Enables IoT-embedding AI systems to exhibit an open and flexible perspective by
    consolidating insights from all existing systems and processes. Bridging possible
    gaps is a key prerequisite of the establishing AI methods in the industry according
    to a sustainable roadmap. Reliability: Enables IoT systems to operate without
    systems outages and regular human intervention. Reliability is essential for productivity
    and is a key prerequisite for AI systems that are put into continuous operation
    with short maintenance time in mission-critical production environments. Resiliency:
    Enables IoT with embedded AI to always operate in stable states, including to
    return to such states after failures. Resilience is essential for their safe support
    for our digital economy. In the future, they should even be able to detect failure
    and initiate measures for compensating it. Accountability: Enables IoT systems
    with embedded AI systems that support or even replace human decisions to be accountable
    to their customers, partners and regulators. Normally, accountability features
    will be integrated “by design” and will be available via the supplier of these
    systems. Verifiability: Enables IoT and AI-based systems to demonstrate the functionality
    and properties they are supposed to have. AI systems for industrial applications
    must fulfil the same standards as legacy systems and will be applied to safety-,
    mission- and business-critical tasks. This requires that AI embedded systems can
    be validated (to reach correct results), verified (verifiable AI) and certified
    (certifiable AI) for the targeted applications. The research challenges for implementing
    AI at the edge of networks for IoT applications are as follows: Mechanisms for
    collecting and aggregating data and information and developing edge models that
    generate insights from the data available in real-time by providing methods and
    techniques to train models in the edge environment with appropriately distributed
    storage capabilities ‘AI-friendly’ processors to address the AI workloads for
    IoT applications requiring AI computationally intensive capabilities; research
    and development concerning architectural concepts to shift central control to
    the edge and the use of modified graphics processor units, hybrid processors and
    AI-based processors, embedding accelerators and neural networks for processing
    specific AI algorithms New energy- and resource-efficient methods for image recognition
    and geospatial processing using AI at the edge, based on machine learning and
    other AI techniques Edge computing implementation based on neuromorphic computing
    and in-memory computing to process unstructured data, such as images or video,
    used in IoT applications Edge computing implementations based on distributed approaches
    for IoT computing systems at the edge Distributed IoT end-to-end security for
    AI-based solutions that process data at the edge using a group of edge nodes to
    work together on a particular task, thereby ensuring that no security holes or
    attacks are possible AI for smart data storage in edge-based IoT AI for software-defined

    IoT/IIoT 3.3.3 Networks and Communication It is predicted that the adoption of
    low-power short-range networks for wireless IoT connectivity will increase through
    2025 and will coexist with wide-area IoT networks [82], while 5G networks will
    deliver 1,000 to 5,000 times more capacity than 3G and 4G networks today. IoT
    technologies are extending known business models, leading to the proliferation
    of different ones as companies push beyond the data, analytics and intelligence
    boundaries. IoT devices will be contributing to and strongly driving this development.
    Changes will first be embedded in given communication standards and networks and
    subsequently in the communication and network structures defined by these standards.
    5G and the IoT promise new capabilities and use cases, which are set to impact
    not only consumer services but also many industries embarking on their digital
    transformations. New massive IoT cellular technologies, such as NB-IoT and Cat-M1,
    are taking off and driving growth in the number of cellular IoT connections, with
    a CAGR of 30 percent expected between 2017 and 2023. These complementary technologies
    support diverse LPWAN use cases over the same underlying LTE network [20]. 3.3.3.1
    Network technology – hyperconnectivity beyond 5G The development of critical communication
    capabilities will be an essential enabler for the development of the IoT. It will
    enable IoT use cases to go beyond data collection and respond to complex scenarios
    requiring precise actuation, automation and mission critical communications. The
    next generation technological enhancements to telecommunication networks, brought
    about by 5G, will allow new connectivity to become the catalyst for next generation
    IoT services by creating innovations such as advanced modulation schemes for wireless
    access, network slicing capabilities, automated network application lifecycle
    management, software-defined networking and network function virtualization, as
    well as providing support for edge- and cloud-optimized distributed network applications.
    The requirements of critical IoT communications are numerous and diverse, ranging
    from the increased reliability and resilience of the communication network, to
    ultra-low latencies and high capacity, while also integrating the context of the
    mission with the ability to respond to strict energy efficiency constraints or
    to cover large outdoor areas, deep indoor environments or vehicles moving at high
    speeds. Bandwidth and delay for services enabled by legacy networks and 5G are
    presented in Figure 3.20. Figure 3.20 Bandwidth and delay for services enabled
    by legacy networks and 5G. Source: Adapted from [95]. Table 3.1 Key critical IoT
    communications requirements Requirements Details Reliability High availability
    of the network Low packet losses Resilience Ability to function in degraded conditions
    Low convergence time Energy efficiency Projected lifespan of equipment batteries
    Low latencies End-to-end latencies of communication systems under 10 ms and sometimes
    inferior (under 5 ms or even under 1 ms). Coverage Coverage of very a large area
    (rural) Deep indoor coverage Coverage of moving vehicles Ability to deploy and
    use private networks Security Authentication of communications Encryption of communications
    Attack detections Capacity Ability of the network to operate with a very large
    number of users Source: IDATE. Starting with LTE Advanced, cellular communication
    standards have begun responding to these requirements by developing new technologies.
    These first developments are opening new possibilities, especially for public
    safety operations, but they are still limited in scope. They notably lack the
    ability to provide the ultra-low latencies required by many critical use cases.
    The development of 5G is seen as central to enabling critical IoT communications;
    indeed, many of the planned 5G features (from network slicing and massive multi-user
    multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) to new messaging services, cellular vehicles-to-everything
    or improved relay capabilities) represent highly important advances for critical
    scenarios, including reliable, low latencies. The critical IoT communications
    requirements are presented in Table 3.1. End-to-end (E2E) network slicing is a
    foundation to support diversified 5G services and is key to 5G network architecture
    evolution. Based on Network Functions Virtualisation (NFV) and Software Defined
    Network (SDN), physical infrastructure of the future network architecture consists
    of sites and three-layer data centres (DCs). Sites support multiple modes (such
    as 5G, LTE, and Wi-Fi) in the form of macro, micro, and pico base stations to
    implement the RAN real-time function. These functions have high requirements for
    computing capability and real-time performance and require the inclusion of specific
    dedicated hardware. Three-layer cloud DC consists of computing and storage resources.
    The bottom layer is the central office DC, which is closest in relative proximity
    to the base station side. The second layer is the local DC, and the upper layer
    is the regional DC, with each layer of arranged DCs connected through transport
    networks. According to diversified service requirements, networks generate corresponding
    network topologies and a series of network function sets (network slices) for
    each corresponding service type using NFV on a unified physical infrastructure.
    Each network slice is derived from a unified physical network infrastructure,
    which greatly reduces subsequent operators’ network construction costs. Network
    slices feature a logical arrangement and are separated as individual structures,
    which allows for heavily customizable service functions and independent operation
    and management [47]. Advanced ML and AI techniques can also be used for optimizing
    the connectivity of future mobile heterogeneous IoT devices to allow them to support
    efficiently a number of diverse services. ML techniques can be used to identify
    the optimal radio technology in mobile IoT devices considering the load and the
    services they support. Additionally, in future cognitive radio-based IoT devices,
    ML techniques can be used to optimize the spectrum channel and width, the devices
    will use and create a self-organizing network of cooperating devices to improve
    spectrum utilization [92–94]. Figure 3.21 End-to-End Network Slicing for Multiple
    Industries Based on One Physical Infrastructure [47]. As illustrated in Figure
    3.21, Enhanced Mobile Broad Band (eMBB), Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communications
    (uRLLC), and Machine Type Communications (mMTC) are independently supported on
    a single physical infrastructure. eMBB slicing has high requirements for bandwidth
    to deploy cache in the mobile cloud engine of a local DC, which provides high-speed
    services located in close proximity to users, reducing bandwidth requirements
    of backbone networks. uRLLC slicing has strict latency requirements in application
    scenarios of self-driving, assistant driving, and remote management. RAN Real-Time
    and non-Real-Time processing function units must be deployed on the site side
    providing a beneficial location preferably based in close proximity to users.
    Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) server and service gateways must be deployed in the
    mobile cloud engine of the central office DC, with only control-plane functions
    deployed in the local and regional DCs. mMTC slicing involves a small amount of
    network data interaction and a low frequency of signalling interaction in most
    MTC scenarios. This consequently allows the mobile cloud engine to be deployed
    in the local DC, and other additional functions and application servers can be
    deployed in the regional DC, which releases central office resources and reduces
    operating expenses [47]. Highly dependent upon both the creation of new technologies
    and the deployment of new communication networks (requiring both important investments
    all along the value chain), critical IoT capabilities are unlikely to be largely
    available before 2025. The 5G spectrum high bands are expected to be deployed
    include the 28 GHz band, as well as the 26 GHz, 37 GHz and 39 GHz bands. The 28
    GHz band may be used in certain countries by the end of 2018 or early 2019, while
    the other high bands are estimated to be available in late 2019. Low bands below
    1 GHz are of interest due to their favourable radio wave propagation characteristics,
    as they provide coverage in remote areas and into buildings. A new band in the
    600 MHz range is expected to be made available by the end of 2018 for 5G services.
    Part of the mid-bands between 1 GHz and 7 GHz are expected to be allocated in
    several countries. Mid-bands within the 3.3 GHz to 5 GHz range will likely be
    made available around 2020 and are seen as important spectrum resources for terrestrial
    5G access networks. The midbands are particularly beneficial as they offer a favourable
    “middle ground” between propagation characteristics (coverage) and bandwidth (capacity).
    There are several spectrum bands already in use by service providers. In general,
    all the current 3GPP bands including low bands (600 MHz, 700 MHz, 800 MHz, 850
    MHz and 900 MHz) and mid-bands (1.5 GHz, 1.7 GHz, 1.8 GHz, 1.9 GHz, 2.1 GHz, 2.3
    GHz and 2.6 GHz) are being considered for 5G services in the future. These bands,
    and composite arrangements of these bands, will be central to delivering 5G coverage
    and capacity for enhanced mobile broadband, IoT, industrial automation and mission-critical
    business cases, as well as for Public Protection and Disaster Relief (PPDR) services.
    In addition, 3 GPP has recently started a separate Study Item to investigate the
    feasibility of using the 6.5 GHz band (5,925 MHz to 7,125 MHz) for 5G services
    [20]. Frequency ranges being studied for identification at World Radio Communication
    Conference 2019 [95] are presented in Figure 3.22. Figure 3.22 Frequency ranges
    being studied for identification at World Radio Communication Conference 2019
    [95]. IoT applications, based on AR and VR, will revolutionize customer experience
    in gaming, retail shopping and other customer-centric applications. Consumer experience
    will be enhanced by high data rates, while extremely low latencies will be achieved.
    However, these developments are of interest to many industries, including the
    automotive, manufacturing, health, energy and public service sectors. There are
    several factors that could impact commercial adoption of Network Slicing as presented
    in Figure 3.23. The adoption of Network Slicing influences the IoT applications
    and the selection of connectivity solutions. In this context, industry activities
    to standardise Network Slicing should focus on minimising the complexity of the
    technical solution so that adoption can be made relatively easy, the IoT use cases
    need to be defined to drive economies of scale and reduce unitary cost of deployment
    and the operators need to make the cost of deploying Network Slicing marginal
    to the broader investment case for 5G [49]. The development of a critical IoT
    is mainly a business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-business-to-consumer (B2B2C)
    demand, and strongly driven by the digital transformation of vertical industries
    and expanding the traditional cellular technology development (which relies heavily
    on consumer brands). Figure 3.23 Factors that could impact commercial adoption
    of Network Slicing [49]. The global market is thus limited in volume, with market
    estimates according to IDATE of about 60 million units by 2030; but this will
    be compensated by high average revenue per units (ARPUs) as the technology will
    respond to a critical demand in many industries in terms of generating important
    cost reductions and new revenue opportunities. Table 3.2 Vertical industrial sectors

    sector, in which the development of the most advanced autonomous cars will use
    critical IoT capabilities to perform tasks, such as complex intersection control,
    dynamic area management, and cooperative cruise control and platooning. The automotive
    industry is already strongly involved in the standardization process of 5G with
    the set-up of the 5G Automotive Association (5GAA). Other verticals of importance
    include connected health, in which critical IoT capabilities promise the generalization
    of teleoperations and robotics surgery. Manufacturing will also be strongly impacted,
    as critical IoT capabilities are among the building blocks of the smart factory
    (enabling advanced automation and remote control). The key requirements for critical
    IoT communications in different industrial sectors are presented in Table 3.2.
    The 5G use cases can be realized to provide solutions in the B2C, B2B, B2B2X and
    IoT market segments. In B2C market, operators offer the services such as high
    definition video (TV, movies, streaming live sports) or home security solutions
    directly to the end consumers. In B2B market, operators offer the services such
    as mobility solutions and Cloud services to the businesses (SMEs, large corporations)
    where the services are typically consumed by the employees of the business. In
    B2B2X market, the services such as ‘In stadium’ high definition video service
    are offered to businesses like stadium operators and they in turn offer the service
    to their premium customers. In IoT market, operators can leverage the low latency,
    high reliability, high bandwidth and massive connections capabilities to offer
    several vertical industry use cases like connected vehicles, smart utilities and
    remote surgery types of applications by participating in the industry specific
    ecosystems and innovating new business models. Figure 3.24 illustrates the 5G
    applications market potential and readiness matrix presenting the connectivity
    and value-added services opportunities in different sectors [98]. Figure 3.24
    5G Applications Market Potential and Readiness Matrix [100]. Figure 3.25 5G use
    in different industrial application areas. Figure 3.26 Key requirements for connectivity
    for factory of the future automation. Figure 3.27 International Mobile Telecommunications
    system requirements for the year 2020 (IMT-2020) mapped to 5G use cases [95].
    International Mobile Telecommunications system requirements for the year 2020
    mapped to 5G use cases [95] are presented in Figure 3.27. These promising prospects
    are attracting many actors to define their future role in the critical IoT market.
    The capabilities of 5G will indeed lead to more complex value chains with more
    actors providing connectivity and bundling connectivity with vertical specific
    services. It is seen by telecommunication companies as an opportunity to diversify
    and offer vertical specific services, but the rest of the value chain is also
    eager to benefit from new revenue streams: from equipment providers betting on
    small cell networks, to over-the-top (OTT) players looking over unlicensed networks
    or pure vertical players integrating connectivity in their new services. Figure
    3.25 illustrates the use of 5G connectivity in different industrial application
    areas. Industrial sectors will depend on smart wireless technologies like 5G and
    LTE advanced for efficient automation of equipment, predictive maintenance, safety,
    process tracking, smart packing, shipping, logistics and energy management. Smart
    sensor technology offers unlimited solutions for industrial IoT for smarter, safe,
    cost effective and energy efficient industrial operation. A number of key requirements
    for factory of the future automation scenarios for connectivity are presented
    in Figure 3.26. 5G communications could be considered a disruptive element enabling
    the vision of a truly global IoT, given that one of the key features of 5G is
    the focus on the integration of heterogeneous access technologies, including satellite
    communication systems. Satellites could play an important role in providing ubiquitous
    coverage and reliability in remote areas and enabling new IoT services. IoT devices
    are not equipped with satellite connectivity, while IoT protocols are not designed
    with satellite requirements in mind. Thus, cross-layer optimization is required
    to allow the collection of IoT data from satellites, load balance and the oﬄoading
    of terrestrial networks, in turn enabling smooth integration of IoT and satellite
    networks. 5G offers a more reliable network and will deliver a secure network
    for the IIoT by integrating security into the core network architecture. Industrial
    facilities will be among the major users of private 5G networks. Future networks
    have to address the interference between different cells and radiation and develop
    new management models to control roaming, while exploiting the coexistence of
    different cells and radio access technologies. New management protocols controlling
    the user assignment with regard to cells and technology will have to be deployed
    in the mobile core network for better efficiency in accessing the network resource.
    Satellite communications need to be considered as a potential radio access technology,
    especially in remote areas. With the emergence of safety applications, minimizing
    latency and the various protocol translations will benefit end-to-end latency.
    Densification of the mobile network strongly challenges the connection with the
    core network. Future networks should however implement cloud utilization mechanisms
    in order to maximize efficiency in terms of latency, security, energy efficiency
    and accessibility. In this context, there is a need for higher network flexibility,
    which combines cloud technologies with software-defined networks and network function
    virtualization, which will enable network flexibility to integrate new applications
    and configure network resources to an adequate degree (sharing computing resources,
    splitting data traffic, security rules, QoS parameters, mobility etc.). The evolution
    and pervasiveness of present communication technologies have the potential to
    grow to unprecedented levels in the near future by including the Web of Things
    (WoT) into the developing IoT. Network users will be humans, machines and things,
    and groups of them. Figure 3.28 Global number of connected IoT devices [27]. 3.3.3.2
    Communication technology Global connection growth is mainly driven by IoT devices,
    both on the consumer side (e.g., smart home) and on the enterprise/B2B side (e.g.,
    connected machinery). The number of IoT devices that are active is expected to
    grow to 10 billion by 2020 and 22 billion by 2025. Figure 3.28 presents the global
    number of connected IoT devices categorised by the communication/protocol technology
    [27]. These trends require the extension of the spectrum in the 10–100 GHz range
    and unlicensed band and technologies, such as WiGig or 802.11ad, which are mature
    enough for massive deployment and can be used for cell backhaul, point-to-point
    or point-to-multipoint communication. Modular integrated connectivity creates
    a scalable mobile platform (modems for 2G/3G/4GLTE), enabling high-speed data
    and voice and various onboard selected LoRa, Sigfox, On Ramp Wireless, NWave/Weightless
    SIG, 802.11 Wi-Fi/Wi-Fi Aware, Bluetooth, ZigBee, 6LowPAN, Z-Wave, EnOcean, Thread,
    wMBus protocols with the simultaneous use of multiple ISM radio bands (i.e., 169/433/868/902
    MHz, 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz). Connectivity modules are based on integrated circuits
    (ICs), reference designs and feature-rich software stacks created according to
    a flexible modular concept, which properly addresses various application domains.
    The load of the network will differ, with some models using the unbalanced load
    of the ad hoc network from the core network point of view, and others using network-based
    solutions by balancing the topology from the core network point of view. In this
    case, the identified network requirements to be supported are the calculation
    of the optimal ad hoc network topology, by using monitoring information, and the
    notification of appropriate actions. Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPANs) The
    highest number of IoT devices is connected through short-range technology (WPAN),
    which typically does not exceed 100 m in the maximum range. These include Bluetooth-connected
    devices, such as headsets, as well as ZigBee- and Z-Wave-connected devices, which
    can mostly be found in smart homes, e.g., for connecting smoke alarms or thermostats
    [27]. Zigbee 3.0 is a networking solution used on top of IEEE 802.15.4 radio technology,
    which includes Wi-Fi and IP Internet capability. Zigbee 3.0 has meshing capability
    and is used as an IoT connectivity solution for a range of smart home and industrial
    applications, including lighting, security, thermostats and remote controls. It
    is secure and supports battery-free devices, meshing, low latency and energy harvesting
    (e.g., motion, light, piezo, Peltier). Zigbee 3.0 also includes Zigbee Green Power,
    which was developed as an ultra-low-power wireless standard to support energy-harvesting
    IoT devices and is effective for IoT devices that are only sometimes on the network
    (i.e., when they have power), enabling them to go on and off the network securely,
    so they can be off most of the time. 6LowPAN is a network protocol that defines
    encapsulation and header compression mechanisms. The standard has the freedom
    of a frequency band and a physical layer and can also be used across multiple
    communications platforms, including Ethernet, Wi-Fi, 802.15.4 and sub-1 GHz ISM.
    The protocol is implementing open IP standards including TCP, UDP, HTTP, COAP,
    MQTT and web sockets, and offers end-to-end addressable nodes, allowing a router
    to connect the network to IPs. 6LowPAN is a mesh network that is robust, scalable
    and self-healing. Mesh router devices can route data destined for other IoT devices,
    while hosts are able to sleep for long periods of time. Wireless Local Area Networks
    (WLANs) Another large category comprises WLANs, which offer a range of connectivity
    up to 1 km. Wi-Fi is the most common standard in this category and experiencing
    significant growth, mostly through the use of home assistants, smart TVs and smart
    speakers, but also increasingly through use in industrial settings such as factories
    (although it continues to play a minor role in those settings compared to other
    technologies) [27]. With the introduction of Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax standard), the
    connectivity performance is enhanced for the use of IoT devices and businesses
    and operators running large-scale deployments. Wi-Fi 6 brings more capabilities
    to support next generation connectivity uses. Wi-Fi 6 offers faster speeds for
    all devices on the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz spectra, with a raw throughput speed boost
    of as much as 37%. Wi-Fi 6 IoT devices can shut down Wi-Fi connections most of
    the time using the Target Wake Time feature and connect only briefly as scheduled
    in order to transmit data they have gathered since the last time this was performed,
    thus extending battery life. Wi-Fi 6 uses orthogonal frequency-division multiple
    access (OFDMA) to improve the efficiency of multi-user multiple-input, multiple-output
    (MIMO) streams. MIMO works both on the uplink and on the downlink and can simultaneously
    receive data from different devices on different channels (maximum of eight in
    Wi-Fi 6) at once. The Target Wake Time feature improves sleep and wake efficiency,
    reduces power consumption and decreases congestion on crowded networks. In Wi-Fi
    6, the theoretical maximum bandwidth of a single stream is 3.5 Gbit/s, and up
    to four streams can be delivered to a single device, which means a maximum of
    up to 14 Gbit/s. Low-Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs) A large chunk of the future
    growth in the number of IoT devices is expected to come from LPWANs. By 2025,
    it is expected that more than two billion devices will be connected through LPWANs.
    The technology, which promises extremely high battery life and a maximum communication
    range of over 20 kilometres, is used by the three main competing standards, LoRa,
    Sigfox and NB-IoT, which are currently being rolled out worldwide with more than
    25 million devices already connected to date, the majority of which are smart
    meters [27]. Another research report predicts that there will be 2.7 billion LPWAN
    IoT connections by 2029 [28]. LPWANs operate in the unlicensed industrial, scientific
    and medical (ISM) spectrum at 900 MHZ, 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz. LoRa is the standard
    protocol of the LoRa Alliance (open, non-profit association established in 2015
    with more than 500 members). LoRa has a bandwidth of 250 kHz and 125 kHz and a
    maximum data rate of 50 Kbps, enabling bidirectional communication albeit not
    simultaneously, and has a maximum payload of 243 bytes. The range is up to 5 km
    in urban areas and 20 km in rural areas depending on the application. There are
    around 50 million LoRa-based end nodes and 70,000 LoRa gateways that have already
    been deployed worldwide [29]. LoRa networks use gateway devices to work and manage
    the network for connecting IoT devices. Sigfox operates and commercializes its
    own proprietary communications technology, which is an ultra-narrowband (100 Hz)
    with a maximum data rate of 100 bps. It also operates in the unlicensed ISM spectrum
    and its small payload (maximum 12 bytes) means it can offer greater coverage geographically,
    reaching up to 10 km in urban areas and 40 km in rural areas. Sigfox offers bidirectional
    connections, with the downlink from base stations to end IoT devices occurring
    following uplink communication. The daily uplink messages are limited to 140.
    Weightless (Weightless-N, Weightless-W and Weightless-P) operates in the unlicensed
    spectrum and is an open standard (Weightless SIG) designed to operate in a variety
    of bands, with all the unlicensed sub-GHz ISM bands, while featuring a 100 kbps
    maximum data rate on uplink and downlink. Weightless can handle 2,769 end points
    per base station on standard smart meter set-ups (200 bytes uploaded every 15
    min). NB-IoT coexists with GSM and LTE and is a 3GPP LTE standard, based on licensed
    cellular networks providing a 200 kHz bandwidth and a 200 kbps maximum data rate,
    which offers bidirectional communication, albeit not simultaneously, and has unlimited
    messages with a maximum payload 1,600 bytes. The global shipments of NB-IoT devices
    will have a compound annual growth rate of 41.8% from 106.9 million units in 2018
    to 613.2 million in 2023 [30]. LTE-M is another 3GPP providing extended coverage
    by using an installed LTE base with the same spectrum, radios and base stations.
    It is implemented as a 4G technology with an important role in 5G. The uplink/downlink
    transfers 1 Mbps and, due to low latency and full duplex operation, can carry
    voice traffic. LTE-M supports more demanding IoT mobile devices, which require
    real-time data transfer (e.g., transport, wearable), while NB-IoT supports more
    IoT static sensors and devices. Cellular and non-cellular LPWA network connections
    will grow globally at a 53% CAGR until 2023, driven by market growth in smart
    meters and asset trackers. In 2017, smart meters and asset trackers contributed
    to almost three quarters of all LPWA network connections, dominated by non-cellular
    LPWA network technologies. By 2023, non-cellular LPWA will cede its market-share
    dominance to NB-IoT and LTE-M, as cellular LPWA moves to capture over 55% of LPWA
    connections. Private LPWA networks, built to address a single vertical application
    or an individual enterprise, have been popular choices for over a decade and accounted
    for 93% of LPWA connections in 2017. LoRa and other non-cellular LPWA technologies
    have benefited from the decreasing cost of ICs, low implementation costs and flexibility
    of private networks, which can be tailored to meet specific enterprise IoT applications.
    As the geographic footprint of public networks rapidly expands, cellular and non-cellular
    public networks will capture over 70% of LPWA connections by 2023 [31]. Future
    IoT devices will require network agnostic solutions that integrate mobile, NB-IoT,
    LoRa, Sigfox, Weightless etc. and high-speed wireless networks (Wi-Fi), particularly
    for applications spanning multiple jurisdictions. LPWA networks have several features
    that make them particularly attractive for IoT devices and applications, which
    require low mobility and low levels of data transfer: Low power consumption that
    enable devices to last up to 10 years on a single charge Optimized data transfer
    that supports small, intermittent blocks of data Low device unit costs Few base
    stations required to provide coverage Easy installation of the network Dedicated
    network authentication Optimized for low throughput, long or short distance Sufficient
    indoor penetration and coverage Wired Few people think of wired connections when
    they think of the IoT. In many settings, a wired device connection is still the
    most reliable option that provides very high data rates at very low cost, albeit
    without much mobility. Particularly in industrial settings, fieldbus and Ethernet
    technologies use wired connections to a large extent, and it is expected that
    they will continue to do so in the future [27]. Sensor/actuator units that are
    installed within a building automation system can use wired networking technologies
    like Ethernet. Power Line Communication (PLC) is a hard-wired solution that uses
    existing electrical wiring instead of dedicated network cables and for industrial
    applications has significant advances. According to the frequency bands allocated
    for operation PLC systems can be divided into narrowband PLC (NBPLC), and broadband
    PLC (BPLC). NBPLC refers to low bandwidth communication, utilising the frequency
    band below 500 kHz and providing data rates of tens of kpbs, while BPLC utilises
    a wider frequency band, typically between 2 MHz and 30 MHz, and allows for data
    rates of hundreds of Mbps. BPLC is recommended for smart home applications requiring
    high-speed data transfer applications like Internet, HDTV, and audio, while the
    use of NBPLC systems is more appropriate for remote data acquisition, automatic
    measuring systems, renewable energy generation, advanced metering, street lighting,
    plug-in electric vehicles, etc. BPLC has higher speed, that reduce the data collection
    period and ensures a real-time remote-control command, but its stability and reliability
    are still determined by the quality of power lines. Another way to classify PLC
    is as PLC over AC lines and PLC over DC lines. Most companies are currently providing
    AC-PLC solutions, PLC in DC lines also has applications for distributed energy
    generation, and transportation (electronic controls in airplanes, automobiles
    and trains). Cellular / M2M 2G, 3G and 4G technology, for a long time, were the
    only option for remote device connectivity. As LPWA and also 5G gain momentum,
    it is expected that these legacy cellular standards will cede their share to new
    technologies as they present a more lucrative opportunity to many end users [27].
    5G 5G is under development and the technology, which promises a new era of connectivity
    through its massive bandwidth and extremely low latency, is now heavily promoted
    by governments, particularly China. The Chinese government views 5G adoption as
    a competitive asset in the quest to move the equilibrium of technological innovation
    from the US and Europe towards China. In the US, the first pre-standard 5G networks
    will provide fixed wireless access (FWA) services to residential and small business
    users by the end of this year. While many more use cases will be targeted once
    the final standard is ratified in 2020, we should already see first adopters next
    year and expect quick growth from there [27]. 5G includes two of the tree scenarios,
    massive machine type communications (mMTC) and ultra-reliable and low latency
    communications (URLLC), which support IoT applications for industries with available,
    ultra-low latency links for next generation IoT services. The Internet as network
    technology is focusing on the internet working among underlay technologies in
    order to provide end-to-end services. Telecoms/communication and Internet/computer
    communication are converging via telephone/cellular and Internet/data networks.
    The TCP/IP paradigm started as an overlay of network technologies, while TCP/IP
    is nowadays integrated in pre-existent network infrastructures and starting to
    include transport and application functionality in the network as well. 5G is
    including the wired/core section of the network, as well as LANs, to architecturally
    integrate cloud/fog/edge systems, based on software network functions, providing
    differentiated service support. The next generation Internet and 5G are converging
    into a fully integrated interoperable network, where people and IoT physical,
    digital and virtual devices interact in real-time. 5G connectivity is one important
    element in building real-time interactive systems and implementing a tactile IoT/IIoT
    in order to provide the communication infrastructure with low latency, very short
    transit time, high availability, reliability and security. LTE evolution will
    continue, while LTE and 5G will co-exist in upcoming years. The availability of
    device hardware and attractive service pricing will influence the adoption of
    5G for various IoT applications across different industrial sectors. 5G monetization
    is a critical success factor for the deployment of 5G and monetization models
    must be supported by different pricing models. Some of the monetization models
    to be considered are [98]: Monetize network, infrastructure and business services
    by leveraging the network and infrastructure capabilities: Operators provide services
    such as Network as a Service, Information broadcasting, Cloud services with high
    QoS that attract premium in B2B segments. Operators become platform providers
    for a variety of micro-services, assuring low latency where needed by providing
    them on the edge. With this model, application developers and vendors could simply
    define how they want their applications to perform and let the connectivity provider
    make it happen. Operators enable the developers to monetize their applications
    that connect to many millions of devices and in turn will be able to secure revenues
    from developers and the end users of these devices. Leveraging the infrastructure,
    vertical industrial solutions can be offered by establishing ecosystems with complex
    partnerships and revenue sharing models. Key for success is to make the economics
    work for both the operators and other participants in the ecosystem to bring useful
    solutions to the market quickly. Monetize value: 5G creates opportunity for operators
    to monetize the ‘value’ created by services with revenue sharing type of models
    rather than being simply the connectivity provider. Applications such as translation
    services, home automation can be monetized by putting compute functionality on
    the ultra-low latency edge networks and thus putting it on the Cloud without compromising
    on latency. Advertisements in the new digital services like high definition content
    offers new monetization opportunities for operators. Data monetization: Operators
    have access to customer data – customer priorities and interactions, network data
    – usage, pattern, massive number of device related data. This massive amount of
    data along with data analytics creates new opportunities for operators to monetize
    insights. Wireless Neighbourhood Area Networks (WNANs) WNANs sit between WLAN
    and long-range technologies, such as cellular, in terms of communication range.
    Typical proponents of this technology include mesh networks such as Wi-SUN or
    JupiterMesh. In some cases, the technology is used as an alternative to LPWA/cellular
    (e.g., in utilities’ field area networks) and in other cases such as a complementary
    element (e.g., for deep indoor metering where nothing else reaches) [27]. Wi-SUN
    is an open standards-based field area network (FAN) used for the IoT and can support
    applications such as advanced metering infrastructure, distribution automation,
    intelligent transport and traffic systems, street lighting, and smart home automation.
    The suite of IoT technologies is based on IEEE 802.15.4, TCP/IP and related standard
    protocols with a bandwidth of up to 300 kbps, a low latency of 20 ms, power efficiency
    (less than 2 mA when resting; 8 mA when listening), resilience, scalability (networks
    to 5,000 devices; 10 million end points worldwide) and using security mechanisms
    based on public key certificates, AES, HMAC, dynamic key refresh and hardened
    crypto. The PHY layer is based on IEEE 802.15.4g, which provides bidirectional
    communication. The network layer is IPv6 with 6LoWPAN adaptation supporting star
    and mesh topologies, as well as hybrid star/mesh deployments. These different
    types of networks are needed to address IoT products, services and techniques
    so as to improve the grade of service (GoS), quality of service and quality of
    experience (QoE) for end users. Customization-based solutions are addressing the
    IIoT while moving to a managed wide-area communications system and ecosystem collaboration.
    Intelligent gateways will be needed at lower cost to simplify the infrastructure
    complexity for end consumers, enterprises and industrial environments. Multifunctional,
    multiprotocol processing gateways are likely to be deployed for IoT devices and
    combined with Internet protocols and different communication protocols. These
    different approaches show that device interoperability and open standards are
    key considerations in the design and development of internet-worked IoT systems.
    Ensuring the security, reliability, resilience and stability of Internet applications
    and services is critical to promoting the concept of a trusted IoT, based on the
    features and security provided by devices at various levels of the digital value
    chain. 3.3.4 Distributed Ledger Technology/Blockchain Technology A distributed
    ledger is a record of transactions or data that is maintained in a decentralized
    form across different systems, locations, organizations or devices. It allows
    data or funds to be effectively sent between parties in the form of peer-to-peer
    transfers without relying on any centralized authority to broker the transfer.
    A distributed consensus mechanism allows members of the network (nodes) to establish
    a common “truth”. There are different mechanisms for this: in the case of Bitcoin
    and other “cryptocurrencies”, a computationally complex “proof-of-work” algorithm
    is used to protect the integrity of the network against change to the public “blockchain”
    by making it impractical for malevolent players to alter the chain. Whilst Bitcoin
    operates on a public blockchain, there is also the possibility to operate distributed
    ledgers privately where network participants are provided with relevant permissions
    to either read or write to (i.e., append) the ledger [33, 34]. Blockchain is a
    technological disruption in secured infrastructures. It is based on a combination
    of encrypted algorithms and duplicated data storage on a network of computers.
    Used as a secured infrastructure, it can meet the demand for security from various
    industries. From a technological perspective, blockchain is a data storage infrastructure
    technology. It makes it possible to store data securely (each entry is authenticated,
    irreversible and duplicated), with decentralized control: there is no central
    authority that controls the information on the chain. This is achieved using encryption
    technologies (hash function and asymmetric cryptography) and a computer network
    of independent nodes. Blockchain technologies were initially designed to be used
    with the Bitcoin cryptocurrency, where they were employed to create a reliable
    ledger of all financial transactions. But blockchain technology is also developing
    in ways that are opening new prospects: The use of blockchains as a ledger of
    transactions (the initial use case) The use of blockchains to accurately archive
    and date important pieces of information The introduction of smart contracts:
    automated conditional transactions that are executed without human intervention
    or the involvement of a trusted third party The advent of decentralized applications:
    applications that use the blockchain as their execution infrastructure, without
    a centralized IT platform The information architecture used by Bitcoin technology
    provides a source for the development, contextualization, exchange and distributed
    security of data needed for the IoT. Blockchains for the IoT transform the way
    business transactions are conducted globally within a trustworthy environment
    to automate and encode business transactions while preserving enterprise-level
    privacy and security for all parties in the transaction. Blockchain solutions
    are, for instance, being developed to identify IoT objects and to sign automatic
    and decentralized contracts between connected devices. The benefits of blockchains
    for the IoT are providing mechanisms for building trust between stakeholders in
    an IoT application and IoT devices with blockchain cryptography, to reduce the
    risk of collusion and tampering, to facilitate cost reductions by removing the
    overheads associated with middlemen and intermediaries, and to accelerate transactions
    by reducing the settlement time from days to almost real-time. Considerations
    in the application of distributed ledgers for the IoT include addressing the storage
    space, the computing power of the devices, security, communication power, transaction
    confirmation time, consensus mechanisms, congestions, costs/fees and price volatility.
    IoT applications using distributed ledger technologies (DLTs) must evaluate several
    attributes regarding the implementation of use cases, which must take into account
    the retention in the distributed ledger, multiparty sharing needs, the trade-off
    between retrieval and flexibility performance for the ledger database features
    and the trade-off in real-time, as there is a time lapse between the moment when
    data or transactions are generated and when the consensus mechanism confirms that
    the information is part of the ledger. The evolution of the blockchain is illustrated
    in Figure 3.29. Figure 3.29 Evolution of the blockchain. Source: Adapted from
    IDATE DigiWorld, Blockchain, October 2016. IoT devices will be used in building
    blockchain-based solutions to support applications aimed at improving operational
    efficiency, transforming the user experience and adopting new business models
    in a secure, private and decentralised manner, so that all stakeholders benefit.
    This is especially the case for blockchain applications that can track and control
    property: from asset management applications (IoT devices being used to track
    assets along the logistics chain) to a radical transformation of business relationships,
    transitioning to a world where any property or object can easily be rented out
    to another user securely and without the need to interact directly with the user
    (the user signs a smart rental contract, which, once the payment has been made,
    gives him/her access to the lock for a set period of time). The IoT can make use
    of blockchain-based computing platforms (e.g., iExec, Golem, Sonm, Hypernet, Ripple)
    or Hyperledger, which is an open source Linux Foundation platform. Recently, the
    Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, a blockchain standards organization, and Hyperledger
    announced that they have joined each other’s groups [22, 23]. Other solutions
    offered by Ripple, BigchainDB and Sovrin exist [37–39]. The Hyperledger platform
    [22, 24] connects data from the IoT via specific adapters in order to integrate
    a variety of existing sensors and protocols, as well as integrate and connect
    transactions that are related to these sensors with blockchain systems that might
    belong to different stakeholders. The platform allows for the use of cognitive
    artificial intelligence (AI) components to infer new insights from these combined
    data. Further research is needed to define how to optimally combine blockchains,
    cognitive AI and the IoT for various industry domains. Figure 3.30 Combining blockchain
    technology and the IoT with the use of IBM Watson and blockchain platforms [41].
    Figure 3.31 Using blockchain and the IoT to improve operations in the aviation
    industry [40]. Combinations of blockchain technology and the IoT into an IoT-driven
    blockchain, as used in the aviation industry, are presented in [40, 41] (see Figures
    3.30 and 3.31). The combination of blockchains and the IoT provides several benefits
    in supply chains such as: tracking objects as they travel along the export/import
    supply chain, while enforcing shipping and lines of credit contracts and expediting
    incremental payments; maintaining an indelible history of parts and end assembly
    through supply chains, potentially including critical events that affect life
    or scheduled maintenance; providing decentralized edge computing to securely run
    computing workloads, such as analytics, on edge devices owned by third parties;
    interconnecting IoT devices by allowing distributed devices to request and pay
    for services through distributed role management and micropayments, as well as
    regulatory compliance, in order to track equipment or process history in an indelible
    record, and enabling easy sharing of this information with regulatory agencies
    or insurers [41]. IOTA is a next generation blockchain focused on use in the IoT
    as a “ledger of things”. IOTA uses a revised distributed ledger design known as
    a “tangle”, which aims to be massively scalable as well as avoid the cost of replicating
    all data to all nodes [35, 36]. Hypernet is proposing new architecture and has
    implemented a new programming model beneath the blockchain layer to handle distributed
    computation problems, which require inter process communication. Hypernet is based
    on the principle of distributed average consensus (DAC), and the combination with
    blockchains allows for the efficient distribution of compute jobs, while effectively
    managing processing units in dropping on and off the network. The platform creates
    a secure backbone, where buyers and providers of computational power can engage,
    based on trust. The on-chain (scheduled) and off-chain (DAC) technology layers
    of Hypernet fit together, with both driven by consensus. Golem, iExec and Sonm
    have built their concept on traditional computing architectures developed specifically
    to be used in data centres. These data centre architectures pose challenges to
    a distributed network used in the IoT as the amount of network communication and
    data transfer overhead is very high and the architectures do not tolerate computers
    randomly dropping in and out of the network. As data centre architectures are
    optimised for one particular topology, they cannot be used on a distributed network,
    as the network topology is unknown. Blockchain-based systems require devices in
    the blockchain to have the resources run the blockchain software and process blockchain
    data. However, distributed ledgers are open, with devices connected to a distributed
    ledger known as “nodes”. Each “block” within the ledger has a maximum size of
    1 MB and IoT devices used to hold a full copy of the ledger need to have processing
    and storage capabilities necessary to hold at least a few “full nodes” containing
    the complete ledger. IoT security issues are relevant when using blockchain technology,
    as there is a need for proper security credentials to view a transaction and IoT
    device commissioning and secure key management are challenging issues in the case
    of IoT devices. Addressing and solving the limitations of blockchain technology
    in the future could allow for the integration of blockchain-based platforms for
    the IoT. Furthermore, considering that a blockchain contains the transaction and
    can also contain the contract, the IoT device can process financial information,
    buying/selling data from/to another IoT device or system, which could produce
    a transactional system less prone to the problems of resilience. The blockchain
    model has several limitations for the use with IoT devices as blockchain processing
    tasks are computationally intensive and timeconsuming, while IoT devices have
    limited processing and storage resources to directly participate in a blockchain.
    Lower-end IoT edge devices with limited storage space, communications bandwidth
    and processing power are not especially suitable to support resource-intensive
    distributed ledgers but can utilize the services of a distributed ledger network
    (e.g., by using an API). IoT gateway devices, such as an IoT home gateway, could
    potentially support blockchains (e.g., Raspberry Pi as a “full node”). The requirement
    for large amounts of disk storage adds cost and complexity, making it more likely
    that this would be reserved for higher-end gateway products. Lower-end IoT gateways
    and connections with limited bandwidth are more likely to access the distributed
    ledger network using an API. High-end IoT edge nodes, such as industrial controllers,
    smart building controllers and enterprise systems should be able to run capable
    distributed ledger solutions. Maintaining a local copy of the distributed ledger
    provides for local high-performance access to the data held on the ledger, as
    well as continuity in the case that connectivity to the Internet may be disrupted.
    IoT mobile edge computing nodes (i.e., deployed in the carrier network) can be
    used to build new distributed ledger solutions typically offered by telecoms operators
    to enterprise customers as a permissioned distributed ledger [33]. The research
    challenges for implementing DLTs and blockchains at the edge of networks for IoT
    applications are as follows: Techniques for increased scalability, as DLTs and
    blockchains do no scale as required by IoT applications for use in a distributed
    system. Solutions for dealing with the required processing power, as IoT devices
    do not have the processing and storage capabilities required to perform encryption
    for all the objects involved in a blockchain-based ecosystem. Connecting large
    numbers of IoT devices requires large volumes and very low cost, while the majority
    of these IoT devices are not capable of running the required encryption algorithms
    at the desired speed. Techniques to speed up the process of validating the transactions
    for IoT devices. Storage capabilities (e.g., internal flash memory or external
    NOR or NAND flash) to be used to store transactions and device IDs, as well as
    the ledger on the nodes as the ledger increases in size as time passes. Addressing
    the complexities of the convergence of DLTs, blockchains and IoT technologies
    and providing simpler implementations at the system level. Interoperability issues
    when combining data sources from different applications, while considering the
    lack of data model standards for industrial vertical markets. Legal and compliance
    issues for hybrid transactions management across different industrial sectors.

    businesses, applications and services are scaling up and going through various
    digital transformations in order to deliver value for money and remain competitive.
    In this context, they are becoming increasingly vulnerable to disruption from
    denial-of-service attacks, identity theft, data tampering and other threats. Emerging
    distributed end-to-end security technologies enhance the ability of an IoT ecosystem
    and its devices to exhibit complex behaviour independently or collectively in
    the presence of threats, in a pursuit to achieving end-to-end security. By using
    such technologies as blockchain, swarm logic and AI, IoT can offer security by
    design and end-to-end security solutions never implemented before. Techniques
    such as simulation and optimisation allow for the integration of security early
    in the design, where a diversity of security breach scenarios can be tested and
    guarded before they occur in real life. Interoperability, scalability and security
    are three of the most essential attributes of IoT environments and ecosystems,
    which are absent or not fully addressed in today’s architectures. Several technologies
    have succeeded in offering sound and complete solutions to these matters, although
    not without challenges still remaining. A new 3D IoT layered architecture capturing
    the IoT systems functions and cross-cutting functions is presented in Figure 3.32.
    Among them, blockchain technology has been developed for scale and with interoperability
    in mind; hence, it is often generalized as DLT. Its security mechanism, based
    on public ledger and consensus, is applied across the stack and the network, whether
    this is centralized, decentralized or distributed. Nevertheless, in spite of all
    security advancements, guarding against single scenarios of fraud, hacking and
    other breaches still remains a challenge. Different IoT topologies require different
    security configurations and strategies, and this is especially true at the edges,
    where devices can be diverse, less traditional, small and possibly out of reach
    for security updates. The edges are therefore vulnerable, providing entry points
    for malicious attacks, which are difficult to track and therefore easily propagate
    throughout the whole IoT ecosystem. Figure 3.32 3D IoT Layered Architecture. As
    edge devices are often unsophisticated devices, it may be difficult to build security
    into the design. However, it is here that swarm technology may come to the rescue.
    Edge devices may form clusters, where they collaborate and share resources and
    functions in the presence of perceived danger. Each edge device, now belonging
    to a cluster, will exhibit collective intelligence and be able to evolve and adapt
    to new requirements and threat situations. Swarm technology helps to identify
    the threat and define its landscape. In the evolving IoT market, security goes
    beyond securing the information exchanged among the IoT nodes. The entire operation
    of an IoT ecosystem depends on protection at all levels, from single devices to
    communications. Moreover, devices must exhibit a high level of resilience against
    a growing range of attacks, including hardware, software and physical tampering.
    Security is therefore critical to IoT technologies and applications, and end-to-end
    security is essential to enabling the implementation of trustworthy IoT solutions
    for all stakeholders in IoT ecosystems and IoT value networks to enable the development,
    deployment and maintenance of systems in IoT applications and provide a common
    framework to enable the growth of IoT value network solutions. The standard security
    services that are valid for the Internet framework and technology, such as authentication,
    confidentiality, integrity, non-repudiation, access control and availability,
    should be extended to also apply to IoT technologies but adapted with their particularities
    and constraints in mind. Identification: is the act of allowing a device or service
    to be specifically and uniquely identified without ambiguity. This may take the
    form of RFID tag identifiers, IP addresses, global unique identifiers, functional
    or capability identifiers, or data source identifiers. Authentication: is the
    act of confirming the truth of an attribute of an entity or a single piece of
    data by using passwords, PINs, smart cards, digital certificates, or biometrics
    to sign in. In contrast with Identification, Authentication is the process of
    actually confirming the Identity of a device or confirming that data arriving
    or leaving are genuine and have not been tampered with or forged. Authorization:
    is the function of specifying access rights to resources and ensuring that any
    request for data or control of a system is managed within these policies. Authorization
    mechanisms tend to be centralized, which may be a challenge in IoT systems that
    tend to be increasingly decentralized, without an authority involved. Whatever
    the degree of democratized authorization, where more entities can grant permissions,
    the authorization system must be consistent, persistent and attack resistant.
    Availability: has two definitions within the IoT domain. Firstly, as with mainstream
    Information Assurance, the system must provide data and resources in a timely
    manner for a set percentage of the time (e.g. 99.99% uptime availability). Secondly,
    in the IoT it is critical that many devices are available or retain their critical
    functionality, even if the system has undergone an attack. Confidentiality: is
    a set functionality that limits access or places restrictions on certain types
    of information, with the goal of preventing unauthorized access. Confidentiality
    is usually achieved through encryption and cryptographic mechanisms and is essential
    within an IoT ecosystem where a large amount of information is exchanged among
    the nodes. Integrity: is a critical measure in information assurance and is defined
    as providing consistency or a lack of corruption within the IoT system. It requires
    the final information received to correspond with the original information sent
    and that data cannot be modified without detection. Malicious modification of
    the information exchanged may disrupt the correct functioning of an entire IoT
    ecosystem. Non-repudiation: is an aspect of authentication that enables systems
    to have a high level of mathematical confidence that data, including identifiers,
    are genuine. This ensures that either a transmitting or receiving party cannot
    later deny that the request occurred (cannot later “repudiate”) and provides data
    integrity around the system. This is of particular importance in terms of tracking
    illegal activities within an IoT system, as it allows for accountability to be
    enforced. Whether Non-repudiation needs to be enforced under certain circumstances
    will depend on the particular applications. A Root of Trust: is an immutable boot
    process within an IoT system based on unique identifiers, cryptographic keys and
    on-chip memory, to protect the device from being compromised at the most fundamental
    level. The Chain of Trust extends the Root of Trust into subsequent applications
    and use cases. Given that IoT systems rely on a large number of devices that collect
    and process information, it is paramount to ensure their credibility so that they
    are honest and leverage correct outputs. Secure Update: enables IoT systems and
    devices to install new firmware from authorized sources without the firmware being
    compromised. Software updates are critical processes and are susceptible to a
    number of threats and attacks. During an update, the device receives the firmware
    wirelessly and installs it, removing the previous version. However, to reassure
    that the process is being done properly and securely, the sender of the firmware
    should be verified as trusted, the firmware should be validated as not compromised,
    the initial security keys should be protected, etc. Additionally, depending on
    the services that the device offers, the downtime during a firmware update may
    need to be kept at a minimum. If not properly protected, devices may be open to
    manipulation, typically through the installation of malicious code on a device.
    3.5 IoT/IIoT Technology Market Developments IoT/IIoT components, communication,
    systems, platforms, solutions applications and services markets are developing
    steadily, posing new challenges for research and innovation concerning IoT technologies
    addressing next generation developments. The IoT chip market is expected to register
    a CAGR of over 13.68% during the forecast period of 2018–2023. The report profiles
    end user segments (such as healthcare, building automation and automotive segments)
    in the IoT chip market in various regions. Chipsets designed for IoT systems have
    unique factors including the need for optimal energy efficiency. The network effect
    is clearly evident as the impact of increasingly interconnected IoT systems will
    cause an acceleration in overall demand for chipsets due to the interdependency
    of platforms, gateways and devices [26]. The number of connected devices that
    are in use worldwide now exceeds 17 billion, with the number of IoT devices at
    seven billion (not including smartphones, tablets, laptops or fixed-line phones).
    Global connection growth is mainly driven by IoT devices – both on the consumer
    side (e.g., smart home) and on the enterprise/B2B side (e.g., connected machinery).
    The number of IoT devices that are active is expected to grow to 10 billion by
    2020 and 22 billion by 2025 (see Figure 3.33). The global market for IoT (end
    user spending on IoT solutions) is expected to grow by 37% from 2017 to $151 billion.
    Due to the market acceleration regarding the IoT, those estimates have been revised
    upwards and it is now expected that the total market will reach $1,567 billion
    by 2025. Software and platforms are expected to continue to drive the market as
    more data are moved to the cloud, new IoT applications are brought to market,
    and analytics continue to gain in importance [27]. Figure 3.33 Total number of
    active device connections worldwide [27]. 3.5.1 Digital Business Model Innovation
    and IoT as a Driver The growing digitisation of businesses as well as societies
    has facilitated an increase in the amount of data made available and to be adopted
    and explored in the development of businesses. Digitisation is creating a second
    economy that is vast, automatic and invisible – thereby bringing the biggest change
    since the Industrial Revolution [1]. Data has become massive and has moved from
    static data to real-time data streams created by the IoT based on a large number
    of transactions of millions of sensors and devices across the ecosystems of many
    organizations, even now moving from the central paradigm of the cloud more and
    more towards the edge in a distributed manner [2]. Some studies estimate an increase
    in annually created, replicated and consumed data from around 1,200 exabytes in
    2010 to 40,000 in 2020 [3], with a growing proportion of data generated and consumed
    by machines [3]. In businesses, IoT data can be applied, for instance, to target
    customers more effectively; make better pricing decisions; predict failures; and
    optimise the use of assets, production or logistics. To fully exploit IoT in business
    we need to understand how businesses integrate technology [2]. 3.5.1.1 Business
    models and business model innovation Business models are intended to make sense
    of how businesses work. Business models are abstracted in different ways in the
    literature. Business models are discussed in [6] as a narrative that describes
    the customer, customer value, revenue collection of the model and the delivery
    of this value. Another level of abstraction is presented in [11]. In this reference
    the business model is described as an archetype of 55 different business model
    building blocks that can be combined in various ways to accommodate the business
    model in which the business operates. The most popular and most adopted break-through
    on another level of abstraction is the graphical framework. The most widely adopted
    graphical framework is the Business Model Canvas presented in [10]. The business
    model literature points to the fact that the technological development of the
    Internet and recent developments of ICT has boosted the usage of the business
    model concept and innovation in general. According to [9] in the context of innovation,
    the term Business Models is used to either commercialize new technology or ideas
    and as a source of innovation to the business model itself, that can lead to a
    competitive advantage. Figure 3.34 The importance of Business Model Innovation
    with respect to external changes in the environment. The use and importance of
    business model innovation is stated in [12] and illustrated in Figure 3.34: Business
    Model Innovation will continue to become increasingly important for ensuring sustained
    competitiveness of both large and small businesses. Business Model Innovation
    is expected to serve as a facilitator of new market exploration and an important
    source of competitive advantage. Continuous adaptation of business models is imperative
    to ensure organizational fit with the environment. However, there are significant
    research gaps combining technology trends with business model innovation: Empirical
    evidence remains patchy and often builds on observations of businesses that have
    successfully implemented new business models without knowing how the innovation
    has been created in the first place. Business Model Innovation frameworks are
    technology agnostic and often abstract the complexity of ecosystems, technology
    development/operations and organisations challenges. 3.5.1.2 The use of IoT for
    digital business development IoT and digital technologies are central for digital
    business development and the disruptive business innovation tendencies of this
    decade and probably also decades to come. Consequently, Nambisan et al. [4] conceptualise
    digital innovation as “the creation of (and consequent change in) market offerings,
    business processes, or models that result from the use of digital technologies”
    and therefore, digital innovation management refers to the “practices, processes,
    and principles that underlie the effective orchestration of digital innovation”.
    Thus, we need to examine how different company types, industries and sectors apply
    digital technologies to design digital businesses and digital business models.
    3.5.1.3 The design and implementation processes of digital business development
    Through digitisation of the business functions through IoT, data can be provided
    to enhance and develop each of these functions and thus the entire value chain.
    In practice this is demonstrated in the dramatic change of the marketing functions
    focus on online, social media and mobile marketing and less of a focus on traditional
    advertising, thus creating stronger interactions and continuous data collections
    with customers through social networks. Through the online environment, assortment
    and pricing decisions is made easier and much more flexible. Logistics and logistics
    streams are key to competitive delivery and services, and the marketing and logistic
    functions therefore need to cooperate more effectively in order to deliver superior
    customer value, and at a lower and more competitive cost [2]. With standards to
    represent different forms of data (text, numbers, pictures and video) facilitating
    communication via Bluetooth and the internet has led to the evolution of new products
    and services, and thus data has become a commodity. Thus, we need to explore the
    specific processes that go into the adoption and implementation of digital business
    development viewed from both a business and technology angle. The effect and business
    opportunities of digitisation across ecosystems. Digitisation affects entire ecosystems,
    their business models and the underlying business functions of a company’s value
    chain. With intelligent devices becoming interconnected in IoT, new developments
    have created associated infrastructure and an expanding knowledge base, and these
    innovative combinations are being reflected in enterprises’ “digital” business
    models [5]. Thus, we need to examine which metric and measurement systems are
    applied and require development to better assess the tangible as well as intangible
    value creation and capture of digital business development. How technology, organisation
    and business interact is still poorly understood. Most studies have focussed on
    successful businesses and have been conducted within a discipline like business,
    innovation, technology or organisation. The literature provides some patchy evidence
    which shows Business Model Innovation (BMI) as a cross-disciplinary activity,
    connected with technology. It is also clear that IoT is a strong driver for business
    development and digitisation in industry, with many new applications and services
    emerging and driving new business models. We call for more concerted efforts to
    link business and technology at the applied research level and to devise new methods
    of studying IoT. Acknowledgments The IoT European Research Cluster – European

    SA, Spain Abstract The chapter aims at describing the cybersecurity and privacy
    methodologies and solutions that the architecture defined in the ACTIVAGE Large-Scale
    Pilot, and the corresponding implementation in nine Deployment sites should follow
    to secure the IoT system and protect the personal data from potential malicious
    cyber-attacks and threats. It further presents common definitions, methods and
    repeatable processes to analyse and address all potential threats in terms of
    cybersecurity and privacy that might occur during the exploitation phase of the
    project. 4.1 Introduction The Internet and mobile revolution have transformed
    our world. The Internet of Things (IoT) has significantly emerged over the last
    few years, aiming to change our lives by forming a massive ecosystem where interconnected
    devices and services collect, exchange and process data in order to adapt dynamically
    to a context to offer a variety of services. By 2020, market analysts expect between
    20 and 50 billion connected devices in the world. With all the benefits originating
    from the use of IoT technology, also come a range of ever-increasing challenges
    and security threats including data manipulation, data theft, and cyber-attacks.
    For instance, the ransomware landscape has dramatically shifted in 2017 and organizations
    bore the brunt of the damage caused by new, self-propagating threats such as WannaCry
    and Petya. Most recently, a report from Symantec ISTR [1] revealed that there
    were 470 thousand ransomware infections in 2016 and 319 thousand in the first-half
    of 2017. The threats and risks related to the Internet of Things devices, systems
    and services are of manifold and they evolve rapidly. With a great impact on citizens’
    safety, security and privacy, the threat landscape concerning the Internet of
    Things is extremely wide and evolves rapidly. Hence, it is important to understand
    what needs to be secured to develop sophisticated security measures to protect
    the IoT infrastructure. Information (or data) lies at the heart of an IoT system,
    feeding into a continuous cycle of sensing, decision-making, and actions. The
    billions of “things” can be the target of intrusions and interferences that might
    dramatically jeopardize personal privacy. Since IoT is seen as a key enabler for
    creating new services and improving overall quality of life, consumers need to
    have trust and confidence about their data being secured and protected, therefore,
    making the cybersecurity of IoT systems an essential part. Currently, there are
    no official guidelines available for trust of IoT devices, in addition, there
    is no regulatory compliance defined for minimum-security requirements. Despite
    the existence of many security guidelines in general, the literature lacks primary
    guidelines to help adopt security measures and standards for the IoT systems.
    The European Union (EU) is working on several fronts to promote cyber resilience
    across the EU. It published several proposals in a ‘cybersecurity package’ in
    September 2017 [2]. Furthermore, the EU set up the Large-Scale Pilots to deploy
    IoT systems in five main areas [3]. The main goals of these LSPs is to solve key
    practical issues such as interoperability, security and privacy, business models,
    validation of IoT powered applications and services at large-scale, etc. In this
    context, this chapter reports the initial outcomes obtained from security and
    privacy performed in the ACTIVAGE project [1] [4]. These activities contribute
    into mainly two areas: [1] ACTIVAGE project is a key factor in the IoT for the
    “Active and Healthy Ageing” (AHA) domain producing evidence of the IoT value on
    fostering the deployment of AHA solutions in Europe, through the integration of
    advanced IoT technologies across the value chain, demonstrating multiple AHA-IoT
    applications at large-scale in a usage context, in real operational conditions.
    IoT for the AHA domain is a strategic element for the creation of dynamic ecosystems
    to answer and prevent the challenges faced by health and social care systems.
    Differently from other sectors, “AHA-IoT” services are provided to persons taken
    individually and it takes place across all domains, as persons live in houses,
    neighbourhoods, cities, rural areas, mountains and valleys, access to transport
    systems, drive cars, go to shopping centres, airports, theatres, etc. Persons
    are the most extraordinary producers of individual’s data: production and consumption
    of personal data across domains has become the front-line of concern, data privacy,
    security, authentication, access consent, ownership, storage management. In summary,
    ACTIVAGE is an LSP that brings together the IoT and AHA communities to demonstrate
    the value of the first with respect to successful implementation of AHA solutions
    in terms of QoL for Citizens, Sustainability of Health and Social Care Systems
    and Economical and industrial Growth in Europe. Technological – a secure large-scale
    deployment of connected objects. Societal – related to the project context, which
    is to create a smart environment for the ageing well of elderly people allowing
    the collection of sensitive personal data. As in ACTIVAGE, the experimentations
    will involve around 7,000 users across 9 Deployment Sites (DSs) [2], the consortium
    has a great concern when it comes to the security and privacy related challenges
    and an opportunity to resolve these issues with the help of large-scale validation
    and testing. Platforms using public communication infrastructure will interconnect
    many IoT devices, which are inherently weakly secured. Several services will process
    confidential data by requiring control over the propagation of access control
    in the spirit of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) [5]. GDPR is a
    primary law regulating how companies/organizations protect EU citizens’ personal
    data. [2] A Deployment site is a city or a region in the European Union in where
    a full large-scale pilot is set. This chapter gives an overview of the end-to-end
    security and privacy impact analysis performed in order to provide actionable
    recommendations. The outcomes are in the shape of guidelines and framework related
    to the cybersecurity and privacy aspects. The security risk analysis is conducted
    at each layer of an IoT system and its deployment procedure. The objective is
    twofold: to bring an awareness of the security risks to the stakeholders involved
    in each deployment site and the provision of solutions/recommendations – concerning
    the technologies and services to be deployed for security and privacy of the IoT
    infrastructure. The chapter aims at describing the cybersecurity and privacy methodologies
    and solutions that the ACTIVAGE architecture and the corresponding deployment
    sites should follow in order to secure the IoT system and data from potential
    malicious cyber-attacks and threats. It further presents common definitions, methods
    and repeatable processes to analyse and address all potential threats in terms
    of cybersecurity and privacy that might occur during the exploitation phase of
    the project. The whole process takes into account: Typical cybersecurity and privacy
    risks due to the IoT context. DSs particularities in terms of cybersecurity needs
    (e.g. data relevance). Relevance and effectiveness of cybersecurity and privacy
    mechanisms already foreseen by the DSs security managers. In this work, an IoT
    system is divided into four layers (domains): device, gateway, cloud and application.
    The security and privacy analysis is performed throughout the entire system starting
    from the device domain to the application domain. It also considers the overall
    system life cycle, i.e. the analysis process is applied not only for the operation
    phase but also at configuration, installation, maintenance and removal phases.
    The rest of the chapter is organized as follows. Section 4.2 presents the global
    objectives and requirements for cybersecurity and privacy in the context of AHA-IoT
    ecosystem. Section 4.3 presents the main recommendations on Cybersecurity and
    Privacy in IoT. Sections 4.4 and 4.5 present the methodologies undertaken for
    security and privacy and the recommendations in this context. Section 4.6 illustrates,
    through example use cases, some security and privacy solutions harnessed from
    the top-down approaches and their associated recommendations. Finally, Section
    4.7 concludes this chapter. 4.2 Global Objectives and Requirements 4.2.1 Security
    In an information system, the key objectives and requirements are defined to prevent
    unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification, or removal of important data
    or information. CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability) triad is a common
    and globally accepted model that is used to secure important information. The
    main cybersecurity objectives [6, 7] are: Confidentiality: no improper disclosure
    of information. Integrity: no improper modification of information (alteration,
    deletion or creation). Availability: no improper impairment of functionality.
    In order to reach above objectives, the typical cybersecurity properties or requirements
    are listed as follows: Authorization: the rules on who is allowed to read, modify
    or delete which information. User and entity authenticity: the assurance that
    the other party is the intended communication peer, no “man-in-the-middle” scenario.
    Integrity (data and service authenticity): the data is not altered during transmission
    (accidentally or intentionally). Confidentiality: the exchanged data cannot be
    overheard or made available to a third party. Timeliness and validity of the data:
    for example, protection against message replay. Non-repudiation of the transaction:
    the assurance that a transaction is auditable. In addition, system integrity requirements
    include a system protection against physical and logical attacks, a secure software
    update mechanism and the monitoring and reaction capability to system malfunction.
    The mechanisms to achieve these requirements are the following: Access Control:
    selective restriction of access to data or services. Entity authentication: for
    example, a cryptography-based “handshake” scheme. Message cryptographic protection:
    encryption and data authentication. Temporization of data: use of nonces, timestamps,
    counters against replay attacks. Code signing: use of cryptographic hash to validate
    authenticity and integrity of the code. Cryptographic key establishment: a scheme
    to allow key exchange between two parties. OS and hardware security: protection
    mechanisms such as root of trust, secure boot, etc. Additional requirements on
    the cybersecurity solutions are scalability and usability, which focus on the
    identification and access control methodology combined with usability of human
    interfaces. Furthermore, the system management deals with the management of the
    keys, the configuration, installation, replacement of devices, and the monitoring
    and malfunction detection. If security and privacy are already big challenges
    on IT systems, these challenges become much more important on the IoT systems
    considering that the attack surface has significantly been enlarged as well as
    the amount of data generated and handled [8]. Furthermore, the impact becomes
    more important considering that IoT devices have not enough processing capabilities,
    in contrast to IT systems, and they have a limited autonomy because they work
    most of the cases on batteries. They use generally different wireless connectivity
    solutions not compliant with existing security standards. Last but not the least,
    the nature of the applications, for instance AHA, requires a high level of security
    to keep end-to-end data integrity, confidentiality and service availability. The
    AHA users are very concerned by these aspects. Secure IoT systems with high level
    of personal data protection are mandatory to keep the users’ trust. These aspects
    are essential to deploy massively the IoT technologies in the coming years. 4.2.2
    Privacy Concerning the objectives and recommendations for the privacy this work
    uses the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (EU 2016/679) [3] as the basis.
    In addition, the Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) process is used to put
    in place such regulation. The article 1 of GDPR defines the following objectives:
    [3] Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of
    27 April 2016. This Regulation lays down relating to the protection of natural
    persons with regards to the processing of personal data and rules relating to
    the free movement of personal data. This regulation protects fundamental rights
    and freedoms of natural persons and in particular their right to the protection
    of personal data. The free movement of personal data within the Union shall be
    neither restricted nor prohibited for reasons connected with the protection of
    natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data. The GDPR defines
    also the following requirements: The protection of the rights and freedoms of
    natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data requires that appropriate
    legal, technical and organizational measures be taken to ensure that the requirements
    of this Regulation are met. In order to be able to demonstrate compliance with
    this regulation, the data controller should adopt internal policies and implement
    measures that meet in particular the principles of data protection by design and
    data protection by default. Such measures could consist, inter alia, of: Minimizing
    the processing of personal data. Pseudonymising personal data as soon as possible.
    Transparency regarding the functions and processing of personal data. Enabling
    the data subject to monitor the data processing. Enabling the controller to create
    and improve security features. 4.3 Recommendations on Cybersecurity and Privacy
    in IoT 4.3.1 Security Security is a complex and critical concern for any manager
    of interconnected digital assets. Many private companies [9], public bodies [10]
    and standardization/harmonization institutes (e.g. RFC 2196 Site Security Handbook)
    have published recommendations aiming at improving the quality and consistency
    of the security levels across interconnected systems. Such recommendations target
    system managers, organization officers, service providers, infrastructure owners,
    product manufacturers, developers, end users and indirectly also attackers. In
    fact, as promoted by security experts, every security measure, mechanism and algorithm
    must rely on publicly available specifications. Recommendations are elaborated
    and publicized proactively [15, 11] and reactively [11]. Interestingly some of
    them are associated to supporting tools [10]. All these sets of recommendations
    present diverse facets of similar rules and recommendations. It is not possible
    to include the whole list in this chapter. However, recommendations insist on
    the fact that security is a continuous process with integrated improvement procedure,
    based on the continuous evaluation of the in-place security. Therefore, external
    inspection such as auditing is a must. Self-auditing and internal expertise are
    strongly required, but by far not enough. External companies offer services to
    analyse the implemented security, including security standards, such as ISO/IEC
    27001 and 27002, the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. 4.3.2 Privacy When developing,
    designing and using applications, services and products that aim to process personal
    data to fulfil their task, the developers/producers of such products, services
    and applications are recommended to take into account the right to data protection.
    It is important to make sure that controllers and processors are capable enough
    to fulfil data protection obligations. Furthermore, the principles of data protection
    by design and by default should be also taken into consideration in the context
    of public tenders. A report by ENISA (the European Union Agency for Network and
    Information Society) elaborates on what needs to be done to achieve privacy and
    data protection by default [13]. It specifies that encryption and decryption operations
    must be carried out locally, not by a remote service, because both keys and data
    must remain in the power of the data owner if greater privacy needs to be achieved.
    The report specifies that outsourced data storage on remote clouds is practical
    and relatively safe, as long as only the data owner, not the cloud service, holds
    the decryption keys. In literature, there are additional principles and guidelines
    available that can be used to achieve privacy and data protection by default,
    also known as privacy by design. Privacy by design [14] is a concept, developed
    in the 90’s, to address the ever-growing and systemic effects of Information and
    Communication Technologies (ICTs), and of large-scale networked data systems.
    The objectives of privacy by design – ensuring privacy and gaining personal control
    over one’s information, and, for organizations, gaining a sustainable competitive
    advantage – may be accomplished by practicing the following 7 foundational principles:
    Proactive not reactive; preventative not remedial. Privacy as the default setting.
    Privacy embedded into design. Full functionality – positive-sum, not zero-sum.
    End-to-end security – full lifecycle protection. Visibility and transparency –
    keep it open. Respect for user privacy – keep it user-centric. 4.4 Security Approach
    4.4.1 Methodology To achieve the objectives defined above, a number of activities
    are performed to lay down the security and privacy policies in the context of
    ACTIVAGE project. For the purpose of security, activities include: Perform a reference
    risk analysis in the ACTIVAGE IoT environment in order to identify the general
    ACTIVAGE security requirements, which depend on the criticality of applications
    or services. Countermeasures to mitigate risks are identified at this stage. Create
    and elaborate the ACTIVAGE security questionnaire. Analyse questionnaires’ responses
    and perform assessments for the DS’ security requirements. Define the security
    cartography and recommendations for each deployment site. The elaboration of the
    security questionnaire considered the following aspects: Collect relevant information
    allowing the identification of missing mechanisms to ensure full end-to-end cybersecurity
    and privacy for each of the DSs. Make it easy for the DSs security managers to
    reply. The DS security manager is in charge of the security and privacy aspects
    related to this DS. Make the DSs security managers aware of cybersecurity and
    privacy issues that have not yet been identified and support the other stakeholders
    to realize the high importance of these aspects that are critical considering
    the nature of the project, which includes data confidentiality, higher vulnerability
    by connecting “smart objects” to the system, etc. Figure 4.1 ACTIVAGE Reference
    Architecture. Security analysis is performed based on the following assumptions:
    All IoT devices and elements constituting the DS meet safety requirements according
    to the existing norms and regulations in conformance to their original purpose.
    This falls into the responsibility of the device manufacturer or SW provider/service
    provider and of the DS manager. e.g., an electrical heater used to ensure the
    comfort of elderly people must respect basic norms for electrical heaters. DS
    security managers know the basic norms and regulations rules with which the devices,
    SW and services used must comply. The managers should be able to provide the corresponding
    evidence and they should highlight any unconformity. Questionnaires take into
    account that the answers are given considering the country rules where the DS
    is deployed. Each of the service providers who plans to use the ACTIVAGE technology
    needs to upgrade and adapt the DS elements/settings/ components to the norms and
    the regulations in force at the time and in relation to the location of the commercial
    exploitation. The general risk analysis adopted the ACTIVAGE Reference Architecture
    shown in Figure 4.1 and was carried along the following typical steps: Identification
    and description of all the assets to be protected in the IoT system. Identification
    of all threats and vulnerabilities for each asset. Quantification of security
    risk caused by the threats and vulnerabilities, using a metric. Risk management:
    the decision on which risks to counter and which ones are acceptable. The risk
    analysis leads to the definition of the appropriate security measures. 4.4.1.1
    Assets identification and description An Assets list was established as a guideline
    to be carefully analysed, completed (if needed) and used for each DS. It includes
    all data in the system, services, pieces of hardware, software, communication
    links and may be extended to intellectual property, brand reputation, buildings
    etc. The most important items in this list are given hereafter. Data assets include
    application and management data. The typesets and formats should be defined in
    the data model. Application data describe the elements or resources of the IoT
    system. They include, for example: Data describing all entities producing or consuming
    data (Identifiers and attributes of individuals, stakeholders, sensors). Data
    that are monitored and analysed by the IoT system in order to ensure the expected
    service (raw measurements, processed data elements). Decisions of the system that
    influence the subject’s environment (guidance or prescriptions for individuals,
    environmental instructions for smart sensors, configuration instructions for devices).
    Management data relate to system operation. They include, for example: Procedure,
    action plan descriptions (definition of all the planned actions in case of occurrence
    of an extreme event). Data storage organization definition (for example, a Grading
    Table, Detail Description predefines categories for data storage, such as Medical
    information, Medical report, Wellness information, Service, etc.). Access Rights
    Table, defining the access rights for each stakeholder profile. Transaction registers,
    logging the History of all operated transactions (communication channel, data,
    data user, time, etc.). Cryptographic material that may include log-in credentials,
    cryptographic secrets for authentication and encryption, root-of-trust information
    (e.g. trusted PKI public key), public key certificates, etc. Assets also include
    hardware and software elements. Communication channels. The connection between
    the devices and the IoT-Gateway is generally wireless (BLE, Z-wave; Zigbee, etc.).
    The connection between the IoT-Gateway and the Cloud can be an Internet connection.
    However, and many times, the IoT-Gateway is connected via Wi-Fi/Ethernet to a
    second Gateway that performs the Internet connection via 2G/3G/4G or a wired connection
    (XDSL, Cable, OF). On the application end, the connection between the user and
    the Cloud can be wired or wireless. The wired connection can be through the chain
    Lap and Desk Tops, LAN, Gateway. The Gateway allows connecting the user with the
    Internet network and this one to the Cloud. The wireless connection (2G/3G/4G)
    is done by having a direct connection between the Smart Phones and Tables directly
    to Internet having access to Web applications. Component hardware. For example,
    typical hardware assets to consider at the low domains (Device and Gateway) are
    data storage units, processing units, power management blocks, sensing and actuating
    blocks as well as all device interfaces (e.g. I/O, JTAG ports, etc.) and device
    casing. Maturity and configuration must be assessed. Component software and configuration
    information. Software must be analysed at all levels: OS, firmware, application
    embedded software, high-level application container. Boot mechanisms and system
    configuration at all IoT levels also need particular protection and are included
    in the assets list. Trust associations (end-to-end security). Establishing an
    end-to-end security association, between the data source and their final destination,
    provides a higher and often necessary level of data protection. The data are not
    made available at any of the intermediate hops, since they are encrypted at their
    source and only the final data user is able to decrypt them. 4.4.1.2 Security
    risk analysis tools: Product or service compliance class, STRIDE, DREAD The IoT
    Security Compliance Framework [15] and other guideline documents issued by the
    IoT Security Foundation are used to enhance best security practices during development
    and installation of an IoT product (or system or service). The Framework includes
    the definition of Compliance Classes for products and a series of criteria in
    order to validate their security depending on the targeted class. Applicability
    of the requirements on a product depends on its compliance class, which is expressed
    as a number between 0 to 4, increasing with security level. To define compliance
    classes, three levels of risk impact, BASIC, MEDIUM and HIGH, are defined for
    each of the three security objectives, namely confidentiality, integrity and availability.
    For instance, MEDIUM confidentiality corresponds to “Devices process sensitive
    information (including Personally Identifiable Information – PII); limited impact
    if compromised” and is required from class 2. The risk analysis methodology followed
    in ACTIVAGE to identify the threats is based on the STRIDE Methodology, see Table
    4.1. This Threat classification model was developed by Microsoft [18, 19], and
    helps answering the question “what can go wrong in the system?” The risk mitigation
    technologies (Cybersecurity measures or Cybersecurity controls) against a STRIDE
    threat to apply on the system element under consideration depend on the element
    type, perspective (developer, administrator) and assessed risk level (DREAD rate).
    Recommendations by foundations or standard bodies give guidelines in this task,
    providing lists of Cybersecurity requirements depending on risk level (or compliance
    class) as well as best-practice tips [16, 17]. Table 4.1 STRIDE Threat Concerned
    Security Property Spoofing Authentication Tampering Integrity Repudiation Non-repudiation
    Information disclosure Confidentiality Denial of service Availability Elevation
    of privilege Authorization In the case study described here below, we identify
    the Cybersecurity controls to apply to each system element and gives an indication
    of: The compliance classes for which the control must be applied. The applicability
    level, which is defined as mandatory (the requirement shall be met, as it is vital
    to secure the product category) or as advisory (the requirement should be met
    unless there are sound reasons such as economic viability or hardware complexity,
    in which case the reasons for deviating from the requirement must be documented).
    Figure 4.2 IoT device assets and STRIDE representation. 4.4.1.3 ACTIVAGE as example
    of Risk Analysis The Threat analysis is performed on Device, Gateway, Cloud and
    Application domains following the proposed IoT reference architecture. As an example,
    the STRIDE analysis applied to an IoT reference Device is detailed below. Proposed

    and Services). Data grading table in (DS1) & Access right table in (DS1). In Device
    Data Flow (DF), the following analysis must be performed on: Connectivity/Communication
    channels: BLE, Wi-Fi, LoRa, NB-IoT Nature of Data: Individual Subject, Devices,
    Raw & Processed Data, Instructions (Users, Environmental, Devices & Services).
    In this example, the threats concerning the related asset are identified in red
    bold characters in Figure 4.2: In DS1: Tampering, Repudiation, Information disclosure
    and Denial of service. In P1: Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information disclosure,
    Denial of service and Elevation of Privilege. In CC1: Tampering, Information disclosure
    and Denial of service. Subsequently, an evaluation of the vulnerability of the
    IoT Device is performed. The question to be answered is: “What will be the impact
    of the attacks on the assets?” All the threats for every element are rated using
    DREAD method ranked from 1 to 3 point, where the DREAD rate refers to all the
    risks as defined in Table 4.2. Table 4.2 DREAD ranking definition Risk Risk Property

    in Europe has gained a lot of visibility through the advent of the new General
    Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) entered in force on May 25th, 2018 in the European
    Union. Until recently, companies making business out of personal or other types
    of data systematically pushed privacy back. Entities promoting the privacy preservation
    and enforcement processes propose different approaches. In this chapter, the authors
    propose to develop a general methodology on Privacy to define a privacy impact
    analysis for a given IoT System and provide recommendations and guidelines in
    order to minimize the Privacy threats. The complete methodology is described hereafter.
    It is under deployment in the Deployment sites of the ACTIVAGE project. Moreover,
    and in complement of the Security methodology described in Section 4.4, the authors
    made an analysis of the GDPR to identify the Privacy modules/services/articles
    that should be implemented in any IoT system of the ACTIVAGE project. This analysis
    allowed identifying some use cases that are well suited to be implemented using
    a Blockchain based technology, as described in the Section 4.6.3. 4.5.2 Methodology
    to Perform Privacy Analysis and Recommendations Figure 4.3 shows the Privacy methodology
    proposed in order to perform risk privacy analysis on an IoT system. This is the
    methodology we have used in ACTIVAGE for this purpose. The expected outcomes are
    the identification of the countermeasures/recommendations for this IoT system
    to minimize the risks of privacy threats: data theft, data misuse or any other
    malicious usage. This methodology is addressed to any non-professional data protection
    manager to facilitate, him/her, the implementation of the GDPR regulation. Figure
    4.3 Privacy methodology. This methodology consists in the execution of the following
    four main steps: Background – A good acknowledge of the following elements is
    required: What is the GDPR? What is a DPIA and how should be performed? What are
    the IoT System architecture and topology where the Data will be generated, stored,
    processed and exploited (and by whom) to identify security rights? In order to
    get the answers to these questions, the following documents are available [5,
    20–24]. Identify personal data flow and storage – For any IoT system, it is required
    to know its complete and detailed architecture and topology as discussed in Section
    4.4. This information allows “easily” the identification of assets, data flows,
    data storage, process units, users, etc. and their location. Perform Data Impact
    Performance Assessment – (DPIA) This step is key in the methodology. The importance
    of this step and the way to develop it are described with more details in the
    next paragraph. Provide Privacy Impact Analysis and Recommendations – This step
    provides the DPIA analysis results of the IoT system under study and the recommendations
    proposed to deploy the system with good Privacy properties. 4.5.3 Data Protection
    Impact Assessment (DPIA)4 [4] [4] This information contained in this paragraph
    was extracted from [20]. GDPR introduces the concept of a Data Protection Impact
    Assessment (DPIA) [5] [20] and strongly recommend carrying out one for each system
    concerned. This paragraph addresses the following questions: what is a DPIA?,
    when a DPIA is mandatory and how to carry it?, and what are the main elements
    containing a DPIA? [5] The term “Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) is often used
    in other contexts to refer to the same concept”, for more information see [21–23].
    4.5.3.1 What is a DPIA? “A DPIA is a process designed to describe the processing,
    assess the necessity and proportionality of a processing and to help managing
    the risks to the rights and freedoms of natural persons resulting from the processing
    of personal data. DPIAs are important tools for accountability, as they help controllers
    not only to comply with requirements of the GDPR, but also to demonstrate that
    appropriate measures have been taken to ensure compliance with the Regulation.
    In other words, a DPIA is a process for building and demonstrating compliance”.
    Under the GDPR, non-compliance with DPIA requirements can lead to fines imposed
    by the competent supervisory authority. Failure to carry out a DPIA [6] can each
    result in an administrative fine of up to 10M€, or in the case of an undertaking,
    up to 2% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year,
    whichever is higher. [6] For instance, when the processing is subject to a DPIA,
    or carrying out a DPIA in an incorrect way, or failing to consult the competent
    supervisory authority where required. 4.5.3.2 When is a DPIA mandatory? Where
    a processing is “likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of
    natural persons”. Table 4.5 gives some examples where a DPIA is required. Table
    4.5 Examples where DPIA is required Examples of Processing Possible Relevant Criteria
    DPIA Required? A hospital processing its patients’ genetic and health data (hospital
    information system). Sensitive data Data concerning vulnerable data subjects Yes
    The use of a camera system to monitor driving behavior on highways. The controller
    envisages using an intelligent video analysis system to single out cars and automatically
    recognize license plates. Systematic monitoring Innovative use or applying technological
    or organizational solutions Yes A company monitoring its employees’ activities,
    including the monitoring of the employees’ work station, internet activity, etc.
    Systematic monitoring Data concerning vulnerable data subjects Yes An online magazine
    using a mailing list to send a generic daily digest to its subscribers. — Not
    necessarily 4.5.3.3 When should the DPIA be carried out? “prior to the processing”.
    This is consistent with data protection by design and by default principles. The
    DPIA should be started as early as practical in the design of the processing operation
    even if some of the processing operations are still unknown. As the DPIA is updated
    throughout the lifecycle project. It will ensure that data protection and privacy
    are considered and promote the creation of solutions that promote compliance.
    4.5.3.4 What is the DPIA minimum content? The GDPR does not formally define the
    concept of a DPIA as such, but it sets out its minimum features as follows: Its
    minimal content is specified as follows: A systematic description of the envisaged
    processing operations and the purposes of the processing, including, where applicable,
    the legitimate interest pursued by the controller. An assessment of the necessity
    and proportionality of the processing operations in relation to the purposes.
    An assessment of the risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects. The measures
    envisaged to address the risks, including safeguards, security measures and mechanisms
    to ensure the protection of personal data and to demonstrate compliance with this
    Regulation taking into account the rights and legitimate interests of data subjects
    and other persons concerned. Its meaning and role are clarified: “In order to
    enhance compliance with this Regulation where processing operations are likely
    to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller
    should be responsible for the carrying-out of a data protection impact assessment
    to evaluate, in particular, the origin, nature, particularity and severity of
    that risk”. Figure 4.4 illustrates the generic iterative process for carrying
    out a DPIA. It should be underlined that the process depicted here is iterative:
    in practice, it is likely that each of the stages is revisited multiple times
    before the DPIA can be completed. Furthermore, this process should be regularly
    performed to evaluate the IoT system evolution over the time. Figure 4.4 Process
    for carrying out a DPIA. Practical recommendations (necessary but not sufficient)
    when carrying out a DPIA The basic recommendation is to collect only required
    personal data to minimize the risk of non-compliance. It excludes the “just in
    case” approach in which unjustified data is collected for future uses, even when
    they may be justified. It requires a complete audit of the data already in possession
    of the various stakeholders (processors, etc.), and the data must be kept based
    on the principle of usefulness for the subject and necessity for the service.
    4.5.4 GDPR Analysis for Implementation To cope with GDPR in an IT system and more
    particularly on IoT based system (as such foreseen in ACTIVAGE where security
    and privacy are of high importance according to AHA applications supported), a
    first analysis was performed on the set of articles constituting the GDPR. They
    were analysed and classified as follows: Legal: Articles related with legal issues.
    Technical: Articles requiring a technical implementation. Accountability: Articles
    related to the organization/company Governance. Principles: Articles providing
    recommendations to be considering in the GDPR implementation. Table 4.6 gives
    the details of this analysis. It is composed of three columns indicating (from
    the left to the right): the type of article (Legal, Technical, etc.), the type
    of service and the article description concerned by the GDPR. Table 4.6 GDPR Analysis
    in view of its implementation Type of Article Provided Function or Service GDPR

    regularly data protection risk profiles. Accountability Governance Article 37
    – Designation of the data protection officer. Article 38 – Position of the data
    protection officer. Article 39 – Tasks of the data protection officer. On top
    of this first analysis, Varonis [7] recommends focusing on the following technical
    aspects during the implementation phase to meet the GDPR [25]: [7] Varonis is
    a pioneer in data security and analytics, specializing in software for data security,
    governance, compliance, classification, and analytics. Data classification – Know
    where personal data is stored on the IT/IoT system. This is critical for both
    protecting the data as well as following through on requests to correct and erase
    personal data. Metadata – With GDPR requirements for limiting data retention,
    basic information on when and why the data was collected are required, as well
    as its purpose. Personal data residing in IT/IoT systems should be periodically
    reviewed to see whether it needs to be saved for the future. Governance – GDPR
    highlights the need to get back to basics. For enterprise (or AHA data), this
    should include understanding who is accessing personal data in the AHA file system,
    who should be authorized to access, and limiting file permission based on users’
    actual roles – i.e., role-based access controls. Monitoring – The breach notification
    requirement places a new burden on data controllers. Under the GDPR, the IT/IoT
    security mantra should be “always be monitoring”. Data protection controllers
    need to spot unusual access patterns against files containing personal data, and
    promptly report an exposure to the local data authority. Failure to do so can
    lead to enormous fines, particularly for multinationals with large global revenues.
    The analysis performed in this section contributed to identify several Privacy
    uses cases to be implemented using the innovative and pervasive Blockchain as
    a potential technology to provide robust and efficient IoT solutions on security
    and privacy. The following section describes these developments. 4.6 Security
    and Privacy Implementation 4.6.1 Introduction This section presents two use cases
    selected to illustrate the interest and the importance to follow a top-down approach
    for security and privacy. During the end-to-end security risk analysis and DPIA
    performed on the IoT systems of the ACTIVAGE project, this approach allowed the
    identification of the recommendations and solutions to put in place to improve
    the security of some IoT system components as well as the services/functions to
    cope with GDPR privacy requirements. It is clear that the Privacy services must
    run on top of a Secure IoT system. The first use case presents the countermeasures
    implemented to secure the data storage of the Raspberry PI Gateway used in some
    Deployment sites of ACTIVAGE. The second use case presents several scenarios where
    the Blockchain technology can be used to provide efficient solutions on security
    and privacy for the ACTIVAGE’s Deployment sites. 4.6.2 Securing a Gateway The
    Gateway in an IoT device to Cloud architecture is a key element as it marks the
    frontier between the public and private domains. In this position in the architecture,
    the Gateway is indeed both an entry path from inside to outside and reverse. In
    a worst-case scenario, somebody gaining access to a Gateway gains access to other
    Gateways, by reproducing the attack at a massive scale. In the ACTIVAGE context,
    Gateways are often deployed in homes, and thus it is not possible to master the
    physical access to the hardware. Moreover, the Gateway, in a residential place,
    might be stolen more easily than a server in a data centre might be. The Raspberry
    PI is a popular platform for its low cost, stability and good support. In experimental
    projects such as ACTIVAGE, it is the platform of choice to be used as a Gateway.
    The analysis done from ACTIVAGE questionnaires on IoT devices used in the 9 Deployment
    sites has shown that at least 4 out 9 deployment sites are considering using such
    hardware platforms as reference for their experiments. However, the Risk analysis
    performed on the Raspberry PI has identified potential weaknesses regarding security.
    A major weakness concerns the SD Card mass storage. Due to its removable nature,
    this mass storage can be easily accessed from a third-party system by simply removing
    the SD Card and plugging it to a computer. In this way, the content would be cleared
    and read/write operation unauthenticable making it easy for a hacker to read out
    and even replace sensitive information such as user’s password, SSH private keys
    or other credentials that could enable privileged access to the entire system.
    Table 4.7 illustrates the impact assessment of the different stride attributes
    for the mass storage of the gateway in the ACTIVAGE context (deployment in residential
    homes). The initial DREAD rates on the third column shows potential impacts. The
    last column shows new rates while mitigating the risks with a secure element.
    A first counter-measure for this weakness would be to encrypt the entire SD Card,
    thus, it requires storing the encryption key in a safe place, which is readable
    by the processor and the firmware while booting the OS located on the storage.
    A common solution for such a safe storage is to use a Trusted Platform Module
    (TPM). TPMs are standardized electronic components which have security related
    functions such as random number, hash and key generators, encryption and decryption
    hardware engines and offers facilities to store in secure manner keys or sensitive
    data such as Platform Configuration Registers. These components are used for example
    for secured boot in UEFI bios. Table 4.7 shows on the two last right columns the
    new DREAD rate while using such a component, with highest risks reduce to a safer
    impact level. Table 4.7 DREAD impact assessment Threat Class STRIDE Security Property

    1.2 Figure 4.5 Raspberry PI model 3 with TPM dedicated hat in white. Figure 4.5
    shows a prototype hat for a Raspberry PI embedding a TPM manufactured and assembled
    in this form by STMicroelectronics. Customization of the Linux Kernel for enabling
    TPM support was also made with the appropriate device tree modification. The TPM
    is provisioned with security credentials bound to the ACTIVAGE Public key Infrastructure
    (PKI), ensuring security credential lifecycle up to the revocation of gateways
    that are suspected to be compromised. This PKI delivers certificates that can
    be used for the OS and application layer, with state-of-art cryptography scheme.
    At the application level, ongoing work is focused on using the TPM secure function
    whenever possible. A first step consists in the partial encryption of the SD Card.
    Indeed, while the kernel is located on a clear partition for booting up, the application
    section is located into a LUKS partition which key is located onto the TPM. It
    prevents somebody reading the SD card from another platform. Future work will
    be to encrypt the entire SD card with the decryption within the boot loader. Other
    work consists in emulating a PKCS11 interface from the TPM. PKCS11 is a standardized
    public key cryptography standard specifically related to tokens. The use of this
    standard enables trustful communication for the establishment of TLS or SSL tunnels,
    which can be used for the traffic between the Gateway and the Cloud. Use of such
    tunnels enables encrypted and authenticated communications and prevents the Gateway
    from being detectable on public network as no IP ports need to be opened for incoming
    connections. Other use of this interface is under investigation for future work
    regarding IoT device provisioning. 4.6.3 Blockchain in Smart Homes Recently, the
    Blockchain technology has been applied for the healthcare industry [26] but also
    in IoT-based Smart Homes [27], reducing the time required to access patient information,
    enhancing interoperability and improving data quality, while reducing maintenance
    costs. A Blockchain is a continuously growing list of immutable records, called
    blocks, which are linked and secured using cryptography. Thus, the adoption of
    Blockchain is a very promising technology towards enhancing the security, privacy
    and trust. As described in the previous sections, ACTIVAGE gives special focus
    on GDPR compliance. Blockchain can act as a very useful tool towards achieving
    GDPR compliance [28], mainly by serving as a trusted decentralized repository
    for identification purposes. However, it has to be ensured that: a) no personal
    data are stored on the Blockchain, b) cryptographic data deletion should be used
    to give to the end-user the “right to be forgotten”. Blockchain can also enhance
    security as it can enable IoT devices to connect securely and reliably avoiding
    the threats of device spoofing and impersonation. Every IoT device can be registered
    in the Blockchain and will have an ID that will uniquely identify this device
    in the universal namespace. In the context of ACTIVAGE project, a trusted management
    solution, based on Blockchain technologies, has been proposed considering the
    results of other H2020 project implementations such as GHOST/H2020, myAirCoach/H2020.
    ACTIVAGE will find in this technology a convenient solution to cope with: Privacy
    regulation based on GDPR. The integrated healthcare and AHA implications for data
    and devices protection. An adequate trusted mechanism for IoT-based devices, users
    and systems within the smart Home environment. The concept of distributed ledger
    technologies can be introduced within ACTIVAGE to support different use case scenarios
    such as: Requesting/giving/updating permissions for accessing personal data of
    the involved user. Device registration. Timely firmware updates. User authentication
    & authorization. The secure data transfer between endpoints, users and healthcare
    network components. Figure 4.6 ACTIVAGE monitoring platform – BaaS platform architectural
    overview. Towards the formulation of a secure and trusted environment using information
    traceability mechanisms and the spreading of the data in AHA information systems,
    a related ACTIVAGE Blockchain framework has been introduced (see Figure 4.6) consisting
    of the following main components: BaaS Web UI (The Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS)
    Web UI) – It is a web front-end for accessing the functionalities provided by
    the Blockchain network that has been implemented within myAirCoach H2020 project.
    Middleware API – The Middleware API enables the communication between the ACTIVAGE
    Monitoring Platform and the Blockchain network. For this purpose, RESTful web
    services are used over the HTTPS protocol. Blockchain network – This is the network
    of Blockchain nodes where information regarding the various transactions are being
    stored. ACTIVAGE decentralised Monitoring Platform – This is a decentralised platform
    where raw data gathered from the sensors installed in the smart homes of the elderly
    users are stored and further analysed towards identifying patterns related to
    user activity (e.g. habits, sleeping times, etc.) and further identifying abnormal
    events that may be related to emergencies. Through the ACTIVAGE Monitoring Platform
    and all the other Blockchain components, a trusted environment is offered to the
    formal/informal carers/end-users as well as to the elderly users/patients. In
    the following paragraphs, several use case scenarios for using Blockchain technology
    within ACTIVAGE are described. 4.6.3.1 Register in BaaS/give consent In this scenario,
    the user accesses the registration form in the BaaS Web UI by clicking on the
    relevant link. After filling the registration form with their data and accepting
    the Terms of Service, a verification email is sent to their email address. By
    clicking on the hyperlink, included in the corresponding email, the user is redirected
    to the BaaS Web UI and their email is verified. After the email verification process,
    the user can Login the BaaS Web UI. The transaction related to user registration
    is logged in the Blockchain. 4.6.3.2 Register in the ACTIVAGE monitoring platform
    through BaaS A user is able to register to the ACTIVAGE Monitoring Platform from
    the BaaS Web UI. Thus, the user first logs in to BaaS with his/her account, goes
    to “Platforms > Not Registered Platforms”, chooses ACTIVAGE from the list and
    clicks on the “Register” button. Then, user is redirected to the ACTIVAGE Monitoring
    Platform and fills in the Registration Form. Similarly, to the previous scenario,
    an email verification process is followed for the completion of user registration
    in the ACTIVAGE Monitoring Platform. The next time that the user logs in the BaaS
    Web UI, ACTIVAGE is among his/her “Registered Platforms”. Again, the transaction
    related to user registration is logged in the Blockchain. 4.6.3.3 Register in
    the ACTIVAGE monitoring platform with BaaS In this scenario, user fills in the
    Registration Form in the ACTIVAGE Monitoring Platform (option: Register via BaaS).
    The ACTIVAGE Monitoring Platform sends the valid credentials of the user to the
    Middleware API through a RESTful Web Service. Then, the Middleware API sends the
    registration request to the user via email and redirects them to the BaaS Web
    UI Registration Form. The user registers using the BaaS Registration Form and
    this transaction of the newly Registered User is logged in the Blockchain network.
    4.6.3.4 Registration of new devices and software updates In ACTIVAGE, Blockchain
    can be applied not only for the secured registration and authorization of users,
    but also for the envisaged IoT-based devices that are being installed in the smart
    Home environment supporting also the timely update of firmware, patches, etc.,
    in order to be performed only by authorized users. 4.6.3.5 Login/Logout When the
    user logs in/out to/from the ACTIVAGE Monitoring Platform, a corresponding request
    for user login/logout is automatically sent to the middleware API over a RESTful
    Web Service. The Middleware API updates the list with online Users that are kept
    within the Blockchain by adding/removing the User to/from the list. Thus, all
    login/logout processes are logged in the Blockchain network. Figure 4.7 Request
    permissions for accessing personal data. 4.6.3.6 Request/Give/Update permissions
    for accessing personal data In this scenario, depicted in Figure 4.7, a caregiver
    asks for permission to access the personal data of an elderly person through the
    ACTIVAGE monitoring platform. This request is sent to the Middleware API, which
    logs it in the Blockchain by also sending a request for permission approval to
    the elderly via email. By using the hyperlinks included in the email, the elderly
    is directed to the BaaS Web UI where he/she can accept or reject the request and
    the corresponding approval/rejection is also logged in the Blockchain network.
    Through the Middleware API, the result is sent back to the ACTIVAGE Monitoring
    Platform and based on the decision of the elderly the caregiver is able or unable
    to access the personal data of the elderly. These scenarios give a good overview
    of the possibilities offered using Blockchain technology in AHA applications and
    more particularly its implementation and validation through the ACTIVAGE project
    in order to ensure security and privacy in its deployment sites. 4.7 Conclusions
    In this chapter, two complementary methodologies were presented one for security
    and the other for privacy in order to address the challenges presented in the
    previous paragraphs. They were developed to help the IoT System developers of
    ACTIVAGE to secure their systems and implement correctly personal data protection
    to cope with the GDPR requirements. These methodologies follow a twofold approach
    a top down and an end-to-end. These approaches concern from one side the security
    risk analysis to identify in advance potential threats and find the countermeasures
    to mitigate/avoid them. From the other side, a privacy approach to put in place
    the GDPR following a DPIA analysis to identify the system characteristics and
    evaluate the risks related to the personal data and its protection. This work,
    developed in the frame of the ACTIVAGE project, can be also reused for any other
    IoT system considering the high constrains on security and privacy required by
    AHA applications. Finally, the solutions presented give a good overview of the
    possibilities offered by the use of the Secure element component to secure IoT
    devices (Gateways and Sensor nodes) and the Blockchain technology in AHA applications.
    Both technologies will take an important place in the implementation and validation
    of the security and privacy requirements of the ACTIVAGE’s Deployment sites to
    provide secure IoT systems with a high level of personal data protection and thus
    to increase the users’ trust. Future work will put in place and validate these
    methodologies and the potentials solutions to secure the 9 Deployment sites of
    ACTIVAGE project as well as the protection of the personal data of each of the
    seven thousands of patients “elderly people” participating in the project. Acknowledgement

    Interoperability in IoT is currently a very complex and difficult challenge in
    IoT. Lack of interoperability drastically constrains potential benefits from the
    interconnection of smart objects and hampers the incipient evolution of IoT (Ambient
    Intelligent Environments, natural transparent human-oriented interfaces, integration
    with machine learning mechanisms, blockchain security and Artificial intelligence).
    INTER-IoT solution for interoperability enables platform-to-platform interoperability,
    across any IoT layer and any application domains. In this chapter, INTER-IoT solution
    for platforms’ integration is applied to relevant use cases in the domains of
    e-Health, AHA, AAL, Transport and Logistics. Furthermore, innovative aspects and
    elements of the INTER-IoT are explained, and the benefits of its implementation.
    5.1 Introduction This chapter is about the enablement of IoT interoperability
    though a novel framework provided by the INTER-IoT project [1, 2]. In particular,
    it is focused on the uses cases and applications of the INTER-IoT framework, and
    on the innovative aspects of its implementation. Interoperability is one of the
    major challenges in IoT and has a vital importance in the exploitation of all
    the potential benefits that can be achieved through this new technology paradigm.
    Without interoperability, possibilities and benefits from the use of IoT are significantly
    constrained [3]. INTER-IoT project provides an open cross-layer framework with
    its own associated methodology and integration tools to enable interoperability
    among heterogeneous Internet of Things (IoT) platforms [2]. INTER-IoT will enable
    the quick and effective development of smart IoT applications and services, on
    top of heterogeneous IoT platforms interconnected, and independently from the
    domain (thus between one or several application domains). This chapter explains
    relevant uses cases of the INTER-IoT framework, focused on different application
    domains (Transportation & Logistics, e-Health, Active & Healthy Ageing, and others).
    In addition, it provides a state-of-the-art of the current situation of interoperability
    in IoT, and an overview of new approaches employed in the INTER-IoT implementation.
    5.2 Current Interoperability State of the Art Regarding the implementation of
    IoT, insufficient interoperability among platforms tends to provoke major issues
    both at the technical and business levels [3, 4]. Typical problems are the impossibility
    of integrating non-interoperable IoT devices into non-homogeneous IoT platforms
    as well as the inability of developing applications and services over several
    platforms and different domains. Other important setbacks are the paucity of IoT
    technology penetration, avoidance of customers and companies in employing IoT
    technology, cost increases in general, impossibility of reusing of technical solutions
    and low user satisfaction. Furthermore, lack of interoperability slows and even
    impedes the incipient evolution of IoT. Ambient Intelligent Environments require
    seamless interoperability among elements and interfaces. Also, interoperability
    is essential for the creation of natural transparent human-oriented interfaces
    of Smart Systems, and it has vital importance for the IoT integration with Artificial
    Intelligence and the inclusion of new mechanisms such as blockchain security.
    In recent years, many solutions have been implemented at different levels, from
    the device layer to complete IoT platforms, due to a great interest of both business
    and research institutions in investigating and developing IoT technology. However,
    there is no reference standard for IoT and the development of one is not expected
    in the foreseeable future [3]. Hence, IoT deployments present high heterogeneity
    at all layers (device, networking, middleware, application service, data/semantics),
    which restricts interoperability among their elements and among them. Though many
    projects have dealt with the development of IoT architectures in diversified application
    domains, not many projects have addressed interoperability and integration issues
    among platforms (a clear exception are Butler and iCore [29]). Furthermore, no
    proposals up to the date of the INTER-IoT project approval have been put forward
    to deliver a general, fully reusable and systematic approach to solve multiple
    interoperability problems existing in the IoT platforms technology. The main goal
    of the INTER-IoT project is to offer a solution for the lack of interoperability
    in the Internet of Things by providing an open framework that facilitates “voluntary
    interoperability” among heterogeneous IoT platforms, at any level an IoT deployment
    (device, network, middleware, application or data & semantics), and across any
    IoT application domain [2, 6]. Therefore, INTER-IoT guarantees a transparent and
    effective integration of heterogeneous IoT technology [2, 5]. By using the proposed
    approach, IoT platform heterogeneity can be turned from a crucial problem to a
    great advantage, as there will be no need to wait for a unique standard for an
    interoperable IoT. Instead, interoperable IoT, even on a very large scale, can
    be created through a bottom-up approach. The majority of current existing sensor
    networks and IoT deployments work as standalone entities, and represent isolated
    islands of information, unable to communicate, interoperate and share information
    with other IoT systems and platforms due to the use of different standards and
    to their high inner heterogeneity. In the infrequent cases in which there is an
    integration effort of IoT elements, it is generally performed at the device or
    data layer, seeking only the collection of data from smart devices. However, there
    are many other levels of an IoT deployment, in which it is very beneficial to
    have interoperability, and many other relevant objectives. Differently from current
    interoperability approaches, INTER-IoT uses a layer-oriented approach to exploit
    in depth functionalities of each different layer (device, networking, middleware,
    application services, data & semantics) [1]. Among the different types and levels
    of interoperability, a main challenge is inter-platform interoperability, which
    is addressed on the INTER-IoT project. 5.3 Inter-IoT New Approaches for Implementation
    5.3.1 Multilayer Approach Differently from current interoperability solutions,
    that typically follow a global approach, INTER-IoT uses a layer-oriented approach
    for performing a complete exploitation of each different layer functions [2].
    Despite of the research and development challenge that the design of a layer-oriented
    approach represents, in comparison to a global approach, it can potentially provide
    a very tight and superior bidirectional integration between different IoT platforms.
    Therefore, a multilayer-oriented approach can potentially offer improved performance,
    adaptability, flexibility, modularity, reliability, privacy, trust and security.
    This layer-oriented approach is composed by several interoperability solutions,
    addressed specifically to each level or layer of an IoT deployment: Device-to-Device
    (D2D), Networking-to-Networking (N2N), Middleware-to-Middleware (MW2MW), Application
    & Services-to-Application & Services (AS2AS), Data & Semantics-to-Data & Semantics
    (DS2DS). Each interoperability infrastructure layer has a strong coupling with
    adjacent layers and provides an interface. Interfaces are controlled by a meta-level
    framework to provide unrestricted interoperability. Every interoperability mechanism
    can be accessed through an API. The interoperability infrastructure layers can
    communicate and interoperate through the interfaces. This cross-layering allows
    to achieve a deeper and more complete integration. Next, the different layers
    and associated tools are detailed: Device layer (D2D): Currently applications
    and platforms are tightly coupled, preventing their interaction with other applications
    and platforms, sensors and actuators communicate only within one system, certain
    platforms do not implement some important services (i.e. discovery), or do so
    in an incompatible way. Roaming elements can be missing or inaccessible. IoT Device
    software is never platform independent as companies create proprietary software.
    These facts present enormous difficulties for the achievement of interoperability.
    At the device level, D2D solution will allow the transparent inclusion of new
    IoT devices and the device-to-device interoperation with other smart objects (legacy).
    D2D interoperability will allow boosting the growth of IoT ecosystems. As a potential
    solution, INTER-IoT proposes a D2D gateway that allows any type of data forwarding,
    making the device layer flexible by decoupling the gateway into two independent
    parts: a physical part that only handles network access and communication protocols,
    and a virtual part that handles all other gateway operations and services. When
    connection is lost, the virtual part remains functional and will answer the API
    and Middleware requests. The gateway will follow a modular approach to allow the
    addition of optional service blocks, to adapt to the specific case. Network layer
    (N2N): Currently the immense amount of traffic flows generated by smart devices
    is extremely hard to handle. The scalability of the IoT systems is difficult.
    Also creating the interconnections between gateways and platforms is a complex
    task. N2N solution aims to provide transparent roaming (support for smart devices
    mobility) and their associated mobility information. It will also allow oﬄoading
    and roaming, what implies the interconnection of gateways and platforms through
    the network. INTER-IoT solution at network level uses paradigms such as SDN and
    NFV, and achieves interoperability through the creation of a virtual network,
    with the support of the N2N API. The N2N solution will allow the design and implementation
    of fully interconnected ecosystems. Middleware layer (MW2MW): At the middleware
    level, INTER-IoT solution will enable seamless resource discovery and management
    of IoT smart objects in heterogeneous IoT platforms. Interoperability at the middleware
    layer is achieved through the establishment of an abstraction layer and the attachment
    of IoT platforms to it. Different modules included at this level will provide
    services to manage the virtual representation of the objects, creating the abstraction
    layer to access all their features and information. Among the offered services,
    there are component-based interoperability solutions within the middleware based
    on communication using mediators, bridges and brokers. Brokers are accessible
    through a general API. Interoperability at this layer will allow a global exploitation
    of smart objects in large-scale multi-platform IoT systems [7]. Application &
    Services layer (AS2AS): INTER-IoT allows the use of various services among different
    IoT platforms. Our approach enables discovery, catalogue and composition of services
    from different platforms. AS2AS will also provide an API as an integration toolbox
    to facilitate the development of new applications that integrate existing heterogeneous
    IoT services. Semantics & Data layer (DS2DS): INTER-IoT solution for the DS2DS
    layer will allow a common meaning of data and information among different IoT
    systems and heterogeneous data sources, thus providing semantic interoperability.
    It is based on semantic translation of IoT platforms’ ontologies to/from a common
    IPSM modular ontology. The Inter Platform Semantic Mediator (IPSM) component will
    be responsible for performing ontology-to-ontology translations of the information
    using ontology alignments. It will be necessary to define explicit OWL-demarcated
    semantics for each IoT artifact that would like to interoperate, communicate and
    collaborate [8, 9]. Cross-Layer guarantees non-functional aspects that are required
    across all layers, such as privacy, security, quality of service (QoS) and trust.
    Figure 5.1 INTER-IoT multi-layered architecture. 5.3.2 Virtualization of each
    INTER-IoT Layer Interoperability Solution In order of providing the option of
    a quick set-up of each of the layers of the INTER-IoT framework, it is given the
    option of running a virtualized instance of each of them for rapidly implementing
    the INTER-IoT interoperability solution. This virtualization is performed by means
    of Docker [30] engine. Through the creation of Docker containers, the software
    layer components are separated from each other and from the underlying hardware
    and operating system. Despite of the virtualization, APIs to access to specific
    layers functionalities are secured, and protected through the use of security
    tokens and certificates, and by the assignment of specific permissions to each
    user or type of user. Each layer solution can be deployed and implemented standalone,
    as far as they are independent from other layers’ solutions. Thus, there is no
    need for a complete implementation to achieve interoperability on a specific layer.
    Though, the combined use of adjacent layers’ solutions multiplies benefits, as
    enables some functionalities among them related to multiple layers. 5.3.3 Universal
    Semantic Translation INTER-IoT offers a novel solution to provide automatic semantic
    translation among any pair of platforms [2]. DS2DS solution performs an ontology-to-ontology
    translation between two platforms, and thus it is able to provide universal semantic
    interoperability. The INTER-IoT approach for achieving semantic interoperability
    among heterogeneous IoT platforms is based on: The definition of explicit, OWL-demarcated,
    semantics for each IoT platform or artifact that is to interoperate, communicate
    and collaborate. An infrastructure that translates messages/data/communication
    from its native format to the common format used across the INTER-IoT infrastructure:
    an IoT Platform Semantic Mediator (IPSM) component that will be responsible for
    translating incoming information, representing semantics of artifact X to semantics
    of artifact Y. The IPSM will use ontological alignments to perform ontology-to-ontology
    translations. The existence of a common modular ontology of INTER-IoT, called
    GOIoTP [26]. The IoT Platform Semantic Mediator (IPSM) is a software component
    that performs semantic translation of data. In the context of the INTER-IoT, it
    is used to translate semantics of messages exchanged by IoT artifacts (platforms,
    gateways, applications, etc.) within the INTER-IoT software. It is composed of
    the IPSM Core and auxiliary components, i.e. Semantic Annotators, and exposes
    a REST API (for configuration). An additional Communication Infrastructure is
    required to enable communication between the IPSM and all other “artifacts” that
    are to use its semantic translation services. The Semantic Annotators are located
    between the “outside world” and the IPSM. Their role is to produce RDF triples
    from data that they receive, e.g. from Bridges (component of MW2MW layer and the
    INTER-IoT middleware), and forward them to the IPSM Core through the Communication
    Channels, instantiated within the Communication Infrastructure. The IPSM Core
    performs the semantic translation of the RDF data, by applying pre-stored alignments
    (representing relationships between input and output ontologies). An instance
    of the IPSM can concurrently “service” multiple “conversations” taking place in
    separate Communication Channels. To achieve this goal, it can communicate with
    multiple instances of Semantic Annotators at the same time. Furthermore, each
    Alignment Applicator services a single Communication Channel and applies a separate
    alignment within the context of such channel. Communication Channels work in publish-subscribe
    mode, which allows a single channel to serve both, one-to-one and one-to-many
    communication. Figure 5.2 Semantic Inter-Platform Ontology-to-Ontology translation
    through IPSM. 5.3.4 Methodology and Tools for Guiding the Implementation A novel
    aspect of INTER-IoT is that provides a methodology to guide and ease the INTER-IoT
    framework implementation. The INTER-METH methodology eases and offers guidance
    on the implementation of INTER-IoT in order to integrate different heterogeneous
    IoT platforms [10]. This makes it possible to achieve interoperability among the
    aforementioned IoT platforms and thus it enables to deploy fully functional IoT
    applications on top of them. There are currently no methodological approaches
    that might enable platform integration in a systematic and comprehensive way.
    It is a well-known truism that the utilization of an engineering methodology is
    of foremost importance at any domain (e.g. civil engineering, software engineering),
    maximizes, and ensures the effectiveness of the processes and actions to be performed.
    In sharp contrast with that, trying to manually apply complex techniques and methods
    in order to achieve platform integration would of necessity result in an unacceptably
    high rate of errors and bugs, which may instead be precluded via systematization
    and automation. The structure of the INTER-METH process can be seen in Figure
    5.3. It is iterative in nature and comprises six successive stages: Analysis,
    Design, Implementation, Deployment, Testing and Maintenance. In principle, the
    output of each stage is the input of the following one. But in practice and depending
    on the particular circumstances being dealt with, is it possible to loop only
    specific steps of the process or else sets of successive ones, facilitating the
    adaptation to new components, and providing flexibility to this technique. Figure
    5.3 Process schema of INTER-METH. Additionally, INTER-IoT provides a set of tools,
    named INTER-CASE, that guide the implementation of the INTER-IoT framework, explaining
    the methodology for each specific implementation case. This set of programs offer
    step-to-step assessment and guidance in this process. Figure 5.4 MW2MW structure.
    5.3.5 Middleware for the Interconnection of Platforms This interoperability middleware
    has syntactic translators (bridges) that are able to convert the specific data
    format employed by an IoT platform to the INTER-IoT data format (JSON-LD), and
    vice versa. Thus, INTER-IoT middleware can provide syntactic interoperability
    among different IoT platforms. Platforms are therefore able to send or receive
    flows of information in a data format understandable for them. INTER-IoT MW2MW
    represents a solution for interconnecting platforms at middleware level, and to
    enable interoperability among them [7]. In regard to the middleware structure
    (Figure 5.4), south from the Communication and Control block, the bridges manage
    the communication with the underlying platforms by translating requests and answers
    from and into messages for the queue. Different bridges might need to use HTTP,
    REST, sockets or other technologies to talk to the platforms, but these will be
    translated northwards into messages. They also pass the message content to the
    IPSM, which is a service external to MW2MW that will allow for ontological and
    format translation between the platforms and a common language. In the services
    group of components, the most important are the Platform Registry and Capabilities,
    that contains the information of all connected Platforms including their type
    and service capabilities, the Resource Discovery that creates requests to obtain
    the necessary information from the platforms, and the Resource Registry, that
    contains a list of resources (e.g. devices) and their properties that can be quickly
    consulted. In the second phase, the Routing and Roaming Service will be expected
    to allow the communication with a particular device independently of the platform
    it is currently connected to, while Authentication and Accountability (not shown)
    would provide services for the security and monitoring of all the actions. 5.3.6
    Virtual Gateway INTER-IoT provides a smart gateway that has the particularity
    that is partially virtual. This gateway provides IoT interoperability at the device
    level and has a modular design. Modularity in protocols and access networks is
    optimal. Any access network, protocol or middleware module can be inserted into
    the structure as long as its interface matches with the controller. The device
    is build up in a way that once the system structure is functional a split-up can
    be realized. Part of the device gateway can be placed in the virtual world to
    allow device activity to higher level at all time. The device dispatcher will
    take care of connecting or simulating the actual platform. When connection is
    lost, the virtual part remains functional and will answer to requests of API and
    INTER-IoT middleware. At the lowest level there are sensors and actuators. These
    are connected to the different input modules. These modules take care of connectivity
    with wireless smart objects. This smart software gateway provides interoperability
    among very different network technologies and protocols. In addition to Wi-Fi
    and Bluetooth, INTER-IoT gateway supports network protocols and technologies specifically
    designed for IoT, such as CoAP, MQTT, LoRa and IQRF, as well as advanced techniques
    for oﬄoading. Moreover, it is able to support the recent network protocol Multipath
    TCP [11], which is thought to be the successor of TCP in the Future Internet [12,
    13], and it is massively used in smartphones due to its capability of bandwidth
    aggregation from different networks [13, 14] (e.g. such as 3G and Wi-Fi networks).
    Figure 5.5 Gateway structure and inner components. 5.4 Inter-Iot Use Cases and
    Applications INTER-IoT has two pilots INTER-LogP, as an interoperable solution
    in the seaport scenario, for port management, and INTER-Health, associated with
    the domain of e-Health. Figure 5.6 INTER-Health pilot. 5.4.1 e-Health (INTER-Health)
    The INTER-IoT approach is case-driven, and it is implemented and tested in realistic
    large-scale pilots. One of its pilots, INTER-Health, is focused on the use case
    of INTER-IoT on e-Health [10], and it is tested on an Italian National Health
    Centre for m-health, involving 200 patients equipped with body sensor networks,
    wearable sensors and mobile smart devices for health monitoring. This use case
    is based on the integration of two e-Health IoT platforms, and its goal is the
    development of an e-Health system through the integration of several IoT platforms
    and medical sensors. This system aims to monitor people’s lifestyle in a decentralized
    and mobile manner for the prevention of health issues such obesity, caused by
    unappropriated diet and lack of physical activity [15]. These monitoring processes
    are meant to be decentralized from the healthcare centre to the monitored subjects’
    homes and supported in mobility by using on-body physical activity monitors. It
    is worth noting that, the strategic importance of such complete use case, is largely
    motivated by the fact that unhealthy lifestyles such as improper and hypercaloric
    diet and insufficient physical activity, are at the base of main chronic diseases
    [16, 17]. During the use case experimentation, the effectiveness of the novel
    system, in terms of lifestyle improvement indices, will be evaluated with respect
    to the current “manual” monitoring performed by conventional Healthcare Centres.
    5.4.1.1 Lifestyle monitor: Medical perspective There are a variety of indicators
    to measure and observe for preventing and/or detecting obesity, following the
    medical protocol given by the World Health Organisation (WHO) [16, 17]. Through
    these indicators, it is possible to determine the health status in terms of appropriate
    or inappropriate weight (levels vary from underweight, normal weight, overweight
    to obesity). These measurements can be collected in health centres by a healthcare
    worker (dietist or doctor). These include objective measurements (body mass index,
    blood pressure, weight, height, waist circumference) and subjective indices (eating
    habits and the practise of physical activity) [15]. For these reasons, the goal
    of this use case is to monitor a person’s lifestyle in a decentralized manner
    with mobile sensors in order to prevent health issues. Specifically, the use case
    requires the monitoring of the following health indicators: The Body Mass Index
    (BMI) (weight/height2) is an objective indicator of the health state of the patient
    (underweight, normal weight, overweight, first level obesity, second level obesity
    and 3rd level obesity) of subjects, also allowing to make the diagnosis of overweight
    and obesity. The waist circumference is an objective indicator for the diagnosis
    of overweight and obesity; values over 80 cm in women and 94 cm in men are considered
    pathological. The physical activity practice is a subjective indicator that detect
    the amount (hours/daily and hours/week) and the type of physical activity (no
    activity; light, moderate and intense activity). This measure is used to detect
    a poor lifestyle with physical inactivity. The eating habits is a subjective indicator
    for measuring the quality and quantity of the diet. This measure is used to detect
    a poor lifestyle due to improper diet and high-calories. This use case will be
    deployed over the integrated system composed through the joint of the IoT e-Health
    platforms UniversAAL and BodyCloud. This will enable the computerized monitoring
    at the healthcare centre coupled with the monitoring at the patients’ homes [19],
    which would be supported by the UniversAAL remote services, while BodyCloud will
    allow to monitor subjects’ physical activity through BodyCloud mobile BSN services.
    5.4.1.2 Platforms to integrate BodyCloud BodyCloud [18] is an IoT platform specifically
    addressed to the creation and management of Body Sensor Networks (BSNs). It has
    a Software-as-a-Service architecture, and it is capable of creating a smart gateway
    on smart phone devices that are able to receive and monitor health rates from
    medical wearable sensors. BodyCloud supports the management and storage of body
    sensor data streams and the oﬄine and online analysis, of the stored data using
    software services hosted in the Cloud in order to enable large-scale data sharing
    and collaborations among users and applications in the Cloud and deliver Cloud
    services via sensor-rich mobile devices. BodyCloud endeavours to support a variety
    of specialized processing tasks and multi-domain applications and offers decision
    support services to take further actions based on the analysed BSN data. The BodyCloud
    approach is based on four main components: The Body-side refers to an Android-based
    element for the monitoring of assisted living by means of smart wearable medical
    sensors, and the collection and upload of data to the Cloud through a smart phone
    that acts as a mobile gateway. The Cloud-side is a Software-as-a-Service element
    that provides Cloud services, such as storage. The Viewer-side refers to the Web
    browser-enabled component for the visualization of data. The Analyst side facilitates
    the analysis of data and the creation of BodyCloud applications. UniversAAL The
    IoT platform UniversAAL [2] (Universal Ambient Assisted Living) is specifically
    designed for the domain of Ambient Assisted Living and medical environments. UniversAAL
    is a platform that enables the creation of assistive systems by connecting different,
    heterogeneous technical devices to a single, unified network. UniversAAL also
    delivers the means to control this distributed system. Well-defined semantics
    is an important concern in medical and AAL environments, to lead to no ambiguity
    in measurements, units and terms employed [13]. In this regard, UniversAAL utilizes
    semantics in a very strict and well-defined manner, unlike many other IoT platforms,
    and employs W3C SSN ontology for IoT and smart devices. [2] http://www.universaal.info
    Complementary Platforms The aforementioned IoT platforms (i.e. BodyCloud and UniversAAL)
    have several high-level characteristics in common and differing aims and technology.
    Both are e-Health platforms that employ Bluetooth technology to interact with
    sensors. Moreover, both platforms employ Cloud data storage, cloud big data analysis
    and data visualization. Though, the two platforms have different specific objectives
    and are not interoperable from a technological point of view. Their specific objectives
    are complementary: UniversAAL is focused on non-mobile remote monitoring based
    on non-wearable measurement devices, whereas BodyCloud provides monitoring of
    subjects in mobility through wearable devices organized as body sensor networks
    (BSN). Thus, their integration would produce a full-fledged m-Health platform
    atop of which multitudes of m-Health services could be developed and furnished.
    Figure 5.7 INTER-Health: BodyCloud and UniversAAL integration. 5.4.1.3 INTER-IoT
    integration of health platforms The integration of UniversAAL and BodyCloud is
    achieved through their interconnection through INTER-IoT, as can be seen on Figure
    5.7. This integration is done across three layers (device, application and semantics).
    The middleware layer of the resulting integrated IoT system is based entirely
    on UniversAAL thus no interconnection is required across different platforms.
    Therefore, INTER-IoT provides integration and transparent interconnection at the
    following levels: at device layer (D2D), enabling the new IoT system to communicate
    with the wireless medical devices supported by BodyCloud and with the fixed e-Health
    devices from the health centre or from the patients’ houses. at the application
    and services layer (AS2AS), the applications for handling patients’ reports the
    reports from UniversAAL are integrated in the overall systems in such a way that
    reports can be complemented with additional data from BodyCloud measurement applications.
    at the data and semantics layer (DS2DS), enabling semantic and syntactic interoperability
    among all platforms and systems. The integration scheme of the aforementioned
    IoT platforms by means of INTER-IoT can be seen on Figure 5.10. 5.4.1.4 INTER-Health
    technical functionalities The integrated IoT system has the following main functionalities:
    collection of objective (weight, height, body mass index, blood pressure or waist
    circumference) and subjective (questionnaires concerning the eating habits and
    the practice of physical activity) measures during the visits at the healthcare
    centre (based on UniversAAL); telemonitoring at the healthcare centre of subjective
    (questionnaires) and objective (weight, blood pressure, etc...) measures sent
    by the patients at home (based on UniversAAL platform); telemonitoring at the
    healthcare centre of the physical activities performed by patient at home with
    wearable devices (based on BodyCloud platform) report and visualization of all
    the measurements collected for analysis and interaction on treatments. Figure
    5.8 INTER-Health System overview. 5.4.1.5 INTER-Health pilot The main goal of
    the INTER-Health pilot is demonstrating how to foster a healthy lifestyle and
    how to prevent chronic diseases by monitoring subjects’ physical characteristics,
    nutritional behaviour and activity [15, 19, 20]. The pilot consists of 200 test
    subjects: 100 subjects following traditional monitoring without IoT devices and
    100 subjects with devices. The latter use the INTER-IoT solution. They attended
    a nutritional counseling session a medical and nutritional centre where their
    initial physical characteristics are measured, using IoT Devices on the premises
    (BMI, waist circumference, weight, blood pressure…). Each subject received a management
    program. Then at home, while they follow the program, they measure their characteristics
    using their phone and IoT devices. The subjects will visit the medical and nutritional
    centre each 6 month for check-ups. The healthcare professional in charge of monitoring
    each user will have access to the history of all the measurements through a dedicated
    web application. The assisted living environment created for INTER-Health enables
    the remote measurement of different physiological parameters by means of medical
    IoT devices such as weigh scale, blood pressure monitor and physical activity
    rate monitor [21, 22]. The aforementioned sensors interact with an IoT platform
    (BodyCloud or UniversAAL), and provide measurements through the connection with
    a smart gateway employing Bluetooth communication [23]. This smart gateway receives
    the measures from the devices and sends them to the platform via 2G/3G/4G/Wi-Fi/ADSL
    connectivity. The platform BodyCloud creates a smart gateway on a mobile phone,
    thus enables a smartphone to become an IoT gateway for the medical sensors. Doctors
    have access to a web medical application that allows them to follow up the monitoring
    of patients remotely at any moment, as well as to contact them via ITC communication
    tools (SMS, e-mail, telephone, and teleconference) and give medical assessment.
    5.4.1.6 Benefits INTER-IoT integration guarantees an effective and efficient interoperability
    between heterogeneous IoT platforms such as the two described e-Health IoT Platforms
    (i.e., UniversAAL and BodyCloud). The proposed interoperable approach will enable
    the development of new cross-platform services. Thus, the main benefit of the
    proposed approach consists of the availability of a more powerful IoT healthcare
    platform for lifestyle monitoring to implement new applications and services that
    the individual platforms could not support. Finally, the aforementioned monitoring
    process can be decentralized from the healthcare centre to the monitored subjects’
    homes, and supported in mobility by using on-body physical activity monitors connected
    to the novel fully integrated IoT environment. This approach, would reduce both
    the transfer costs of patients at medical centres and the waiting times, also
    obtaining constantly updated results to make the necessary adjustments in a faster
    and precise manner. From a final user perspective, INTER-Health use case significantly
    benefits from INTER-IoT solutions: For outpatients subjects: improving the survey
    quality of their health status; improve the definition of risk behaviour; provide
    information on diets and physical activity more relevant with the health status
    and with the risks of the subject compared to the traditional methods; increasing
    the sensitivity of the screening of subjects who need intervention from the local
    doctor or of the hospitals (second and third level obesity, diabetes, etc); reduce
    the time spent in face-to-face contact with the nutritional outpatient and the
    number of travels. For public health services: increase efficiency with the same
    resources used; increase effectiveness through standardization of objective and
    subjective measurements; turning subjective ones, such as activity practice, into
    objective ones (by exploiting IoT wearable systems); enlarge the number and type
    of subjects that appeal to nutritional outpatient. For local doctors: lighten
    the taking charge of healthy subjects by the local doctor for guaranteeing greater
    availability toward pathological subjects; overall, the local doctor becomes a
    vehicle from a lower general incidence of healthcare costs on the income of citizens,
    improve the care and diagnostics efficiency making directly available on the computer
    system of the local doctor, the data present on the platform used from the nutritional
    ambulatory. 5.4.2 Smart Transport & Logistics (INTER-LogP) INTER-IoT has a pilot,
    called INTER-LogP, focused on a use case of Smart Transport & Logistics. INTER-IoT
    offers an interoperable solution in the seaport scenario for port management [7,
    24]. The main objective of this pilot is to provide a service to control port
    access, monitor traffic and assist the operations at the port. Several systems
    will be able to identify trucks and drivers using different devices. This information
    can be shared under certain predefined rules through interoperability between
    the platforms involved; it can be used to monitor trucks inside the port by the
    Port Authority platform (due to security and safety purposes), and to manage more
    efficiently resources in the terminal. Moreover, this information is employed
    to avoid queues in the access gates to the port and the terminal. The use IoT
    platforms in ports can potentially enable traffic and container monitoring, geolocation
    of cargo and vehicles, management of storage and cargo processes and improvement
    of services. These benefits can be multiplied through appropriate sharing of valuable
    information and cooperation among the different IoT platforms in port environments,
    creating synergies. This use case addresses the need of IoT platforms interoperation
    within port actors: such as container terminals, transport companies (road and
    maritime transportation), the port authority, and customers. This pilot has been
    deployed in the port of Valencia, the most important port of the Mediterranean.
    The pilot is mainly composed by an Access Control System, and a Health Emergency
    System, which are possible fruit of the interoperability among platforms provided
    by INTER-IoT. The platforms integrated through INTER-IoT belong to the main actors
    of the port: IoT platforms of the Port Authority, of one of the Port Container
    Terminal (NOATUM Valencia), and Intelligent Transportation Systems of several
    Road Haulier Companies. This interconnection is set at middleware level, employing
    the INTER-IoT MW2MW solution [7]. Figure 5.9 INTER-LogP use case approach. Figure
    5.10 Integration of IoT platforms of different port stakeholders through INTER-IoT.
    Important platforms and systems involved are: In the Container Terminal : SEAMS
    : IoT platform for controlling container terminal machinery TOS : Terminal Operating
    System that controls and handles data associated to any terminal operation (Big
    Data) From the Port of Valencia : PORTCDM : Intelligent transportation system
    for the management of ships arrivals to the port From the Road Haulier Companies
    Different Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) This interconnection provides
    interoperability at middleware level, and flows of relevant information can be
    shared among platforms to enhance services and processes in the port. The enhancement
    of the access control to the port facilities is explained in the next subsection.
    Also, a new service combining e-Health emergencies and port transportation is
    described in this section. 5.4.2.1 Pilot for access control at the port area The
    interoperation of the platforms of main port stakeholders can bring very significant
    enhancement to the services related with the access control to the port facilities.
    Appropriate sharing of information and interoperation among them lead to a more
    efficient access control in terms of time and cost efficiency, security, safety,
    minor waiting times and improved management. Platforms integrated through INTER-IoT
    are from diverse entities from the port environment: the port, a container terminal
    (NOATUM) and several road haulier transportation companies. Relevant information
    shared among platforms are the location of trucks inside the port, information
    regarding load and unload operations, and access controls. The main benefits from
    these services are the collection and analysis of data regarding queues, congestion
    and temporary distribution of traffic, and to manage efficiently the resources.
    Relevant information obtained is the position of the trucks inside the port facilities,
    and its use it is important in the sake of safety and security. All these data
    can be shared between the port authority and the port terminals to improve operations.
    Figure 5.11 High-level view of the access control pilot. Figure 5.12 High-level
    scheme of the pilot for health accident assistance in port areas. 5.4.2.2 Pilot
    for health accident at the port area Starting from the access control pilot, trucks
    will be monitored once they enter in the port facilities. The Emergency Warning
    System (EWS) will be monitoring the data coming from the truck and the driver.
    In case it detects an accident or a medical problem, EWS will publish a notification
    to the port authority in a standard format (EDXL). Once the emergence control
    centre receives the notification, it will be possible to communicate with the
    driver through a push to talk protocol in the driver’s mobile. The main benefits
    we can get from this scenario are: apply in the port communications a standard
    format in accident reporting like EDXL, real-time identification of the location
    of the accident, direct communication with the closest control centre when an
    accident occurs and monitoring driver’s health if it is necessary. 5.4.3 Active
    and Healthy Ageing (ACTIVAGE) ACTIVAGE [27] is a H2020 LSP project that addresses
    the use of IoT technologies in the Active & Healthy Ageing (AHA) domain [25].
    INTER-IoT framework is a core element in the ACTIVAGE system that enables interoperability
    at different levels and fulfills the ACTIVAGE’s needs of interoperability. 5.4.3.1
    ACTIVAGE: Active and healthy ageing initiative ACTIVAGE project addresses the
    use of IoT technologies in the Active & Healthy Ageing (AHA) domain [25]. The
    objective of this project is to prolong and support the independent living of
    older adults in their cities and homes and responding to real needs of caregivers,
    service providers and public authorities. Hence, this project aims to improve
    the autonomy and quality of life of older adults and contribute to the sustainability
    of the health and care systems. The ACTIVAGE project has been designed as a Multi
    Centric Large-Scale Pilot consisting of nine interconnected Deployment Sites (DS)
    distributed over seven European countries. A DS can be defined as a cluster of
    stakeholders in the AHA value network, working together within a geographical
    space. Therefore, a DS includes users (elderly people, formal and informal caregivers),
    service providers, AHA services, health care/social care administration and technological
    infrastructures and technology providers. The DS make use of existing open and
    proprietary IoT platforms. Each DS utilizes a specific IoT platform, or two. The
    different IoT platforms employed in ACTIVAGE DS are FIWARE, SOFIA2, UniversAAL,
    SensiNact, OpenIoT, IoTivity and SENIORSOME. The following DS have been defined
    in the ACTIVAGE project: DS1: Galicia (Spain) will make use of the SOFIA2 platform.
    DS2: Valencia (Spain) will provide services based on a combination of data from
    UniversAAL and Fiware platforms. DS3: Madrid (Spain) will deploy services based
    on UniversAAL. DS4: Region Emilia Romagna (Italy) will make use of the Fiware
    platform. DS5: Greece will offer services based on the IoTivity platform DS6:
    Isére (France) will provide services based on the SensiNact platform. DS7: Woqaz
    (Germany) will develop services based on the UniversAAL platform. DS8: Leeds (UK)
    will deploy services based on the IoTivity platform. DS9: Finland will make use
    of the proprietary IoT platform SENIORSOME. Due to the lack of interoperability
    among IoT platforms, the definition of an interoperability framework is needed
    in order to create a European AHA ecosystem. Figure 5.13 AHA Interoperable DS
    (Smart Home Clusters). With this aim, ACTIVAGE will develop the ACTIVAGE IoT Ecosystem
    Suite (AIoTES), which is defined as a set of tools, techniques and methodology
    for interoperability between existing IoT platforms. The AIoTES Framework will
    provide interoperability among IoT platforms and ensure security and privacy.
    The different DS will connect to AIoTES and AHA applications will be deployed
    over this framework, thus allowing the integration of remote health-care services
    and wearable systems-based health-care services in mobility, which will include
    remote medical measurements, local mobile physical detection and processing, and
    on-line and off-line analysis of lifestyle data. ACTIVAGE aims to achieve interoperability
    at three stages: Intra-deployment site interoperability, which means that the
    services provided at each DS must be interoperable to each other. In order to
    achieve this, any the application should be able to access all the application
    data within the same DS. Moreover, the applications within a DS should support
    multiple IoT platforms and be able to be transferred between different platforms
    within s DS. Figure 5.14 AHA Architecture for Interoperability. Inter-deployment
    site interoperability: enables new services to be automatically incorporated into
    the ecosystem of the DS. This means that different DS should be able to exchange
    application data. Moreover, it should be possible to transfer an application that
    was designed for a DS to a different DS and new applications could be developed
    for multiple DS instead of being designed for a particular DS. Interoperable external
    adopted solutions: according to the needs of each specific DS, new solutions will
    be implemented within the DS. They will be interoperable according to the ACTIVAGE
    interoperability framework. These goals imply that the same data format must be
    used by the applications regardless of the IoT platforms being used in the DSs
    so as the applications can access any platform’s data. Moreover, applications
    initially development for a DS can be extended for any other DS only by adapting
    them to AIoTES instead of making an adaptation for each individual platform. Overall,
    multiple AHA applications and IoT platforms may coexist in the same DS, thus contributing
    to fulfil the main goal of a DS. Therefore, it is required inter-platform and
    intra-platform interoperability among the different IoT platforms of the DS of
    this AHA intiative (FIWARE, UniversAAL, SOFIA2, OpenIoT, IoTivity and Seniorsome).
    Furthermore, this interoperability must be both syntactic and semantic, to allow
    the understandability of the information across platforms and a common interpretation
    of data shared among them. In this regard, INTER-IoT is the key component that
    makes it possible for the ACTIVAGE deployment to enable and ensure platform interoperability
    in DSs. The required interoperability among IoT platforms is provided by the Semantic
    Interoperability Layer (SIL), which is a component of the AIoTES framework. INTER-IoT
    is the key component that provides inter-platform interoperability in this AHA
    deployment. Two components of INTER-IoT, namely, the MW2MW layer and the DS2DS
    layer (composed by the IPSM), have been incorporated in the SIL. The MW2MW layer
    connects to all the IoT platforms and provides a common abstraction layer to provide
    access to platform’s features and information. An important function of the MW2MW
    is to convert the data to a common syntax, which is based on JSON-LD. Once the
    data is in the common format, the IPSM performs semantic translations. As a result,
    AIoTES provides semantic and syntactic interoperability among the different platforms,
    and enables information sharing and interoperation among them. This data shared
    will be understandable for the receiver platform, not only in terms of data format
    but also regarding the meaning of the received information. In addition to these
    INTER-IoT components, the AIoTES framework includes an API, security and privacy
    protection components management functions. Security and privacy span across all
    the components of AIoTES in order to ensure the protection of sensitive data against
    unauthorized access. AIoTES management provides a set of tools that allow access
    to the information of a DS, such as platforms and devices, and mechanisms to facilitate
    the integration of the framework. Finally, AIoTES will provide a common API, which
    will allow a homogeneous access to the components of AIoTES in order to develop
    services and applications able to exchange data from different IoT platforms and
    produce new added value services. Hence, the AIoTES API will make possible the
    development of and ecosystem based on applications and services compatible with
    AIoTES. 5.4.3.2 Use Cases of ACTIVAGE AAL and AHA systems can very significantly
    benefit from interoperability [31, 32]. The following Reference Use Cases respond
    to specific user needs (senior people and caregivers), to improve their quality
    of life and autonomy, in a AHA context, that require IoT interoperability: Daily
    activity monitoring at home for informal caregivers support and for formal caregivers
    follow up in order to alert them about deviations of the elderly persons’ habits,
    allowing early interventions while extending independency. Wireless sensors like
    presence, magnetic contact, power measurement, proximity, are deployed at the
    home of the elderly. A gateway transmits the information to a Cloud where calculation
    on activities, trends and risks is performed. Integrated care for older adults
    under chronic conditions. This use case combines daily activity monitoring at
    home and the use of medical devices for health monitoring. The combination of
    IoT technologies with eHealth solutions in one single integrated IT system, and
    the integration of care protocols from entities traditionally working separately
    will promote the coordination among care providers, joint response to emergencies,
    better planning of resources and more effective interventions. This will lead
    to economic savings and a better quality of life for people with chronic disease.
    Monitoring assisted persons outside home and controlling risky situations. This
    use case combines wearable devices or smartphones and the Smart City infrastructure
    in order to promote socialization and activity. The Smart City infrastructure
    tracks the wearable devices and request for help if certain rules are met in order
    to help persons at risk. Emergency trigger. The system automatically reports an
    emergency when a critical situation is detected. Wireless or wired sensors and
    “panic” buttons distributed in the home environment in strategic situations linked
    to a gateway that forwards the emergency to a call-centre system. Other complex
    scenarios might involve the processing of data in the private or hybrid cloud
    and then the emergency is triggered. Compared to state-of-the-art systems at home,
    emergency works when the user requests for help, but also when the environment
    detects the emergency and the person cannot (unconsciousness, fall, gas). Exercise
    promotion for fall prevention and physical activeness using wearable and ambient
    sensors. Cognitive stimulation for mental decline prevention in order to extend
    the time elderly people live independently. This use case combines behavioural
    monitoring at home and outside, and interventions, such as the promotion of mental
    and physical exercises and gaming, making use of apps in tablets or smartphones
    and peripheral connected devices. Prevention of social isolation by means of communication
    tools at home. This use case promotes social interaction and mobility though the
    use of video-based system and apps connected to the Smart City infrastructure,
    which provides data about events, and linking to other peers. In addition, continuity
    between home (home sensors) and outdoors scenarios (smart phone as a sensor) provides
    seamless information about users’ social activity. Social engagement keeps depression
    and decline away. Comfort and safety at home. This use case includes climate and
    light control, perimeter safety, energy control and home automation. Support for
    transportation and mobility. This use case includes adapted route planning for
    elderly persons both in cities and between different cities. Routes can be computed
    making use of the Smart City data about traffic conditions and other mobility
    aspects and personalized according to goals such as exercise promotions or finding
    the easiest/fastest route. 5.4.4 Other Potential Use Cases INTER-IoT can be employed
    in any domain or across domains where there is a need of IoT interoperability.
    Thus, its use is not limited to the aforementioned use cases and can be utilized
    in the most various IoT environments, allowing very different aims that are enabled
    or partially enabled through interoperability. A clear example is the Smart Cities
    use case, which greatly benefits from the synergies and cooperation among different
    systems and platforms that provide different city services. In this case, there
    is an enormous need of interconnection that is limited by the typical interoperability
    problems in the IoT realm. The application of the INTER-IoT framework is able
    to solve the integration of heterogeneous platforms and systems within a Smart
    City, provide numerous benefits to the citizens and enable the creation of new
    useful services fruit of this interoperability. 5.5 Conclusions and Outlook In
    this chapter, it has been described the current problem of lack of interoperability
    in the heterogeneous Internet of Things realm, and the usefulness of INTER-IoT
    for solving this important problem and enabling the integration and interoperation
    of heterogeneous IoT platforms at all layers and across multiple domains. The
    effective application of INTER-IoT for solving the lack of interoperability among
    platforms has been explained and demonstrated in several use cases associated
    to different application domains. First, the usefulness of INTER-IoT has been
    analysed in a e-Health and AAL use case, in which the interoperability framework
    is implemented. In this regard, INTER-IoT enables the integration and interoperability
    of IoT platforms and provides a more powerful solution that the individual solution
    provided by each one of those platforms. These advantages are a consequence of
    the enablement of synergies and the sum of capabilities of all the integrated
    platforms. Second, INTER-IoT has been a key integrator element in an interoperable
    solution for efficient port management. This use case is focused on the domain
    of Transportation and Logistics. INTER-IoT enables the interconnection of several
    platforms at middleware level, and the syntactic and semantic interoperability
    of any information shared among them, despite of the different data formats, standards,
    message structure and semantics. Because of this interconnection of platforms
    and sharing of relevant data among key entities, several management processes
    in the port can be very significantly improved. Also, the interoperability provided
    by INTER-IoT demonstrates that enables the existence of new services, fruit of
    the new information sharing and the possibilities of cooperation among platforms.
    Third, INTER-IoT interoperability framework is employed in an AHA and AAL use
    case for enabling an assisted living environment in elder homes, to allow ancient
    people to live at home in a safe and autonomous way. INTER-IoT allows different
    IoT platforms to interoperate with the ACTIVAGE system around Europe, to enable
    this autonomous life of elderly people. Finally, other potential use cases are
    mentioned, as far as INTER-IoT framework can be successfully employed in any domain
    and use case that has a need of IoT interoperability at any level (e.g. Smart
    Cities). Regarding implementation aspects, INTER-IoT employs several innovative
    elements to provide enhanced functionality and has clear positive differentiators
    from other interoperability approaches. First, INTER-IoT has a layered approach
    to guarantee tight interoperability on each of the different layers (device, network,
    middleware, application, data and semantics), compared to a more global approach.
    Also, due to this multilayer approach, any of the INTER-IoT layer solutions can
    be employed in a standalone way, providing more flexibility and adaptation to
    specific IoT cases. Additionally, to guarantee a quick and easy implementation,
    INTER-IoT gives the option of running virtualized interoperability solutions for
    each layer through Docker. This virtualization enormously facilitates the deployment
    of the INTER-IoT solutions. Moreover, INTER-IoT has a huge concern on security,
    and layer solutions and APIs are securitized. The INTER-IoT interoperability framework
    provides innovative elements, such as a universal semantic platform-to-platforms
    translator, a middleware that enables the interconnection and interoperation of
    any platform at middleware level, despite of the standards and formats employed,
    and a partially virtualized gateway. Furthermore, INTER-IoT implementation is
    guided and eased through a novel methodology (INTER-METH) specifically designed
    with this aim. Interoperability in IoT, and more specifically among platforms,
    represents one of the most important challenges in IoT, and interoperability solutions
    such as INTER-IoT can potentially unlock immense benefits from the use of smart
    technology, and a huge integrator and enabler of services on top of IoT deployments.
    INTER-IoT can be used in the middle future to enable interoperability solutions
    among the most diverse use cases and domains in which IoT interoperability is
    required, solving modern society problems to let technology improve people’s daily
    life, and propel European economy. Also, INTER-IoT facilitates a key element for
    the evolution of IoT; interoperability is essential for the creation of natural
    human interfaces in IoT systems, the existence of Ambient Intelligent Environments
    or the integration of IoT with Artifical Intelligence. Acknowledgements This work

    modern production processes are nowadays equipped with cyber-physical systems
    in order to capture, manage, and process large amounts of sensor data including
    information about machines, processes, and products. The proliferation of cyber-physical
    systems (CPS) and the advancement of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies have
    led to an explosive digitization of the industrial sector. Driven by the high-tech
    strategy of the federal government in Germany, many manufacturers across all industry
    segments are accelerating the adoption of cyber-physical system and IoT technologies
    to gain actionable insight into their industrial production processes and finally
    improve their processes by means of data-driven methodology. In this work, we
    aim to give insights into our recent research regarding the domains of Smart Data
    and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). To this end, we are focusing on the
    EU projects MONSOON and COMPOSITION as examples for the Public-Private Partnership
    (PPP) initiatives Factories of the Future (FoF) and Sustainable Process Industry
    (SPIRE) and show how to approach data analytics via scalable and agile analytic
    platforms. Along these analytic platforms, we provide an overview of our recent
    Smart Data activities and exemplify data-driven analysis of industrial production
    processes from the process and manufacturing industries. 6.1 Introduction Many
    modern production processes are nowadays equipped with cyber-physical systems
    in order to capture, manage, and process large amounts of sensor data. These sensor
    data include information about machines, processes, and products and are encountered
    in form of data streams. These data streams from the production site are then
    frequently integrated into cloud-based solutions by means of Internet of Things
    technologies in order to allow comprehensive data-driven investigations and process
    optimizations. The proliferation of cyber-physical systems and the advancement
    of IoT technologies have led to an explosive digitization of the industrial sector.
    Driven by the high-tech strategy of the federal government in Germany, many manufacturers
    across all industry segments are accelerating the adoption of cyber-physical systems
    and Internet of Things technologies in order to gain actionable insight into industrial
    production processes and finally improve these processes by means of data-driven
    methodology. The IoT is one of the key enabler for intelligent manufacturing and
    production. It facilitates the intelligent connectivity of smart embedded devices
    in factories and shop floors. Endowing the manufacturing and production site with
    technologies from the IoT, which is then also referred to as the IIoT, has become
    a technical prerequisite for a sustainable and competitive industrial production
    of the future. Digitizing the industrial sector with cyber-physical systems, Internet
    of Things technologies, cloud computing services, and Smart Data analytics leads
    to the fourth industrial revolution, which is denoted as Industry 4.0. The importance
    of strengthen the European industry to become more sustainable and competitive
    is also taken into account by the European Commission. Within the EU Framework
    Programme for Research and Innovation the two Public-Private Partnership (PPP)
    initiatives Factories of the Future (FoF) and Sustainable Process Industry (SPIRE)
    aim to (i) help EU manufacturing enterprises to adapt to global competitive pressures
    by developing the necessary key enabling technologies across a broad range of
    sectors and (ii) support EU process industry in the development of novel technologies
    for improved resource and energy efficiency. Turning industrial Big Data into
    structured and useable knowledge is one of the major data-centric challenges for
    enhancing production processes. Integrating data from heterogeneous systems and
    gaining insight into voluminous amounts of streaming sensor data with high variety
    and velocity requires scalable methods and techniques. Structuring knowledge in
    a way that it can be used to manage and improve industrial production processes
    is one of the objectives of Smart Data analytics. By improving Big Data to a higher
    degree of quality, Smart Data analytics aims to understand the following aspects:
    Purpose: What problem to solve with the data? People: Who is involved? Processes:
    What are the surrounding processes? Platform: Which IT infrastructure is necessary
    for realization? The aforementioned aspects are also referred to as the 4Ps of
    Smart Data. They indicate the information to be gathered in addition to the sensor
    data from the production site in order to get a more complete understanding about
    the data and its surrounding entities. It is obvious that addressing the 4Ps within
    the Smart Data analytics process strongly relies on user-centered methods since
    many of the required information need to be discovered from non-documented data.
    The Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Information Technology FIT has been conducting
    research and development on user-friendly smart solutions that blend seamlessly
    in business processes for about 30 years and has a strong experience in digitization,
    Industry 4.0 projects and IoT solutions. Having about 160 researchers with different
    scientific background, the Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Information Technology
    FIT is organized into five research departments: The User-Centered Computing department
    develops IT systems and technologies that focus on their users throughout their
    complete life cycle. Current work focuses on usability engineering, web compliance,
    and accessibility. The Cooperation Systems department develops and evaluates groupware
    and community systems for virtual teams and organizations. Our work on hardware
    and software of Mixed and Augmented Reality systems focuses on support for cooperative
    planning tasks. The Life Science Informatics department designs and implements
    complex biomedical information systems and creates novel software solutions for
    manufacturers and users in health care, biotechnology, drug research and social
    services. Focal areas are image-based navigation systems, information-intensive
    optical instruments, visual information analysis, multi-parametric molecular sensor
    technology and diagnostics as well as bio-analogue analysis of changing images.
    The Risk Management and Decision Support department offers decision and process
    support for application domains whose processes can be characterized by their
    high level of complexity as well as their weak determination of process structures.
    The Fraunhofer Project Group Business & Information Systems Engineering, located
    in Augsburg and Bayreuth, has proven expertise at the interface of Financial Management,
    Information Management and Business & Information Systems Engineering. The ability
    to combine methodological know-how at the highest scientific level with a customer-focused
    and solution-oriented way of working, is our distinctive feature. As part of User-Centered
    Computing department, the User-Centered Ubiquitous Computing group develops systems
    providing effective personal assistance that dynamically respond to user demands
    and at the same time adapt to new work practices. The group is focusing on the
    application domains Industry 4.0, Smart Cities and Energy Efficiency/Smart Grids
    and approach novel applied solutions via methods from the domains User-Centered
    Design, Internet of Things Platforms, and Smart Data. In this chapter, we aim
    to give insights into our recent research into the domains of Smart Data and Industrial
    Internet of Things. To this end, we are focusing on the following EU projects:
    The MONSOON (MOdel based coNtrol framework for Site-wide OptimizatiON of data-intensive
    processes) project aims to establish a data-driven methodology to support the
    identification and exploitation potentials by applying multi-scale model based
    predictive controls in production processes. It offers an integrated real-time
    and dependable infrastructure easing in improving the efficient use and re-use
    of raw resources and energy across plant- and site-wide applications in heterogeneous
    and distributed production environments. EU funds it under SPIRE (Sustainable
    Process Industry through Resource and Energy Efficiency) research project that
    aims to develop an infrastructure in support of the process industries. The COMPOSITION
    (Ecosystem for COllaborative Manufacturing PrOceSses – Intra- and Interfactory
    Integration and AutomaTION) project has two main goals: The first goal is to integrate
    data along the value chain inside a factory into one integrated information management
    system (IIMS) combining physical world, simulation, planning and forecasting data
    to enhance re-configurability, scalability and optimisation of resources and processes
    inside the factory. The second goal is to create a (semi-)automatic ecosystem,
    which extends the local IIMS concept to a holistic and collaborative system incorporating
    and inter-linking both the Supply and the Value Chains. The COMPOSITION project
    is funded under the Factories of the Future PPP. In conjunction with both EU projects
    mentioned above, EXCELL is a twinning project addressing Big Data applications
    for cyber-physical systems in production and logistics Networks. The consortium
    of academics from Hungary, Great Britain, Belgium and Germany expands the scientific
    activities through central publications and active participation in scientific
    discourses. Priority Research Fields (PRFs) define the topic areas in which the
    partners work closely together to mutually train, support and empower each other
    with their knowledge and expertise. PRFs are for example cyber-physical systems
    and human system interaction, business-based Internet of Things and services,
    as well as data mining and data interoperability. In the remainder of this chapter,
    we will first describe our research activities and results with respect to the
    EU project MONSOON, which is an example for the process industry, in Section 6.2.
    Afterwards, we will continue with the EU project COMPOSITION, which is an example
    for the manufacturing/discrete industry, in Section 6.3. We finally conclude this
    chapter in Section 6.4. 6.2 Process Industry 6.2.1 Introduction The process industry
    is characterized by intense use of raw resources and energy, and thus represents
    a significant share of European industry in terms of energy, resources consumption
    and environment impact. In this area, even a small optimization can lead to high
    absolute savings, both economic and environmental. Predictive modelling techniques
    can be especially effective in optimization of production processes. However,
    the application of these techniques is not straightforward. Predictive models
    are built using the data obtained from production processes. In many cases, process
    industries must invest in the monitoring and data integration as well as in the
    development and maintenance of the underlying infrastructure for data analytics.
    Many other obstacles are also present, e.g., interoperability issues between software
    systems in production, difficulties in the physical monitoring of the production
    parameters, problems with the real-time handling of the data, or difficulties
    in defining relevant Key-Performance Indicators (KPIs) to support management.
    Therefore, the deployment of such predictive functions in production with reasonable
    costs requires consolidation of the available resources into shared cloud-based
    technologies. In the case of more flexible production environments, approaches
    that are even more significant are possible, such as the reinvention or redesign
    of the production processes. However, this is not applicable to major, capital-intensive
    process industries. In this case, the integration of innovations in the established
    production processes can be fundamental in their transformation from resource-consuming
    production into the “circular” model. 6.2.2 Reference Architecture The high-level
    conceptual view of the reference architecture that is developed within the scope
    of the project MONSOON is depicted in Figure 6.1. Figure 6.1 MONSOON Reference
    Architecture. The platform is able to inter operate with the heterogeneous existing
    systems deployed in process industries at different layers of the SCADA pyramid
    (Control, Supervision, Management, Enterprise). It includes sensors or controllers
    (PLCs), SCADA (Supervision control and data acquisition), Management Information
    Systems (MES) and Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP). There are two main components
    of the architecture. The Real-time Plant Operations Platform deployed on-site
    and supports data collection, storage and interaction with the production systems
    respecting relevant constraints and satisfying data-intensive conditions. The
    Cross-Sectorial Data Lab supports the development of new dynamic model base multi-scale
    controls. All the relevant data from the production site are transferred to the
    Data Lab where it is stored and processed for optimization of production process.
    To validate and demonstrate the results, two real environments are used within
    the project: an aluminium plant in France and a plastic factory in Portugal. We
    have identified two main use cases for both domains. For the aluminium sector,
    we focused on production of the anodes (positive electrodes) used in aluminium
    extraction by electrolysis. The first use case was targeted to predictive maintenance,
    where the main objective was to anticipate the breakdowns and/or highlight equipment/process
    deviations that affect the green anode final quality (e.g., anode density). The
    second use case dealt with the predictive anode quality control, where the goal
    was to identify bad anodes with a high level of confidence and scrap them to avoid
    sending them to the electrolysis area. For the plastic domain, the use cases are
    from the area of production of coffee capsules, produced in large quantities.
    In this type of production, it is important to produce the correct diameter and
    height of the coffee capsules and to make sure that the holes at the bottom of
    the capsules are formed properly. Moreover it is also expected to predict the
    failures of molding machines and their stoppages based on the process parameters
    and sensor measurements during molding processes. While the data analysis process
    for the plastic domain is described in Section 6.2.6, we provide a short description
    of main components of the MONSOON platform along with their interfaces in the
    next sections. 6.2.3 Plant Operational Platform The functional view of the architecture
    of the Plant Operations Platform is presented in Figure 6.2. It acts as an advanced
    semantic factory service bus and is in-charge of interacting with existing production
    systems deployed in a plant. The Plant Platform IT infrastructure and its associated
    Real-time Data Integration layer collect the operational raw data from the plant’s
    systems necessary to the execution of the predictive functions. The acquired operational
    raw data and associated relevant information is also routed to the data lab where
    it is stored and used for analytics. Figure 6.2 Functional View of Plant Operational
    Platform. 6.2.3.1 Real-time communication framework It configures the dependable
    real-time communication infrastructure necessary to support operations of prediction
    functions. The Monitoring Tools exploit and integrate existing solutions for real-time
    networking and QoS management and perform continuous (passive/active) monitoring
    of plant-wide process industry resources ensuring that communication-related malfunctions
    are properly detected. The Operation Data Visualization Dashboard provides a web
    user interface where operational managers can configure various real-time visualizations
    of operational data and monitor the deployed predictive functions. The visualized
    data can include operational data from the plant environment or predictions from
    the predictive functions executed in the Run-time Container. 6.2.3.2 Virtual process
    industries resources adapter The main function of the Virtual Process Industries
    Resources Adapter (VPIRA) is data integration, mediation and routing. The Connector
    allows the integration of data from various SCADA, MES and ERP systems deployed
    on the plant site. It ensures that all heterogeneous process industry resources
    and systems are easily accessed and managed. The Abstractor is a distributed and
    scalable data flow engine aiming for routing integrated data to multiple destinations,
    e.g., run-time container or data lab. Routing of data from the source to target
    connectors can be dynamic depending on the type of data or actual content. The
    data flows can be re-configured in a flexible way, connecting multiple sources
    to the multiple targets, overcoming any data heterogeneity problems. Besides the
    flexible configuration interface, the Virtual Process Industries Resources Adapter
    provide a flexible programming interface to simply implement connectors or processors
    for new types of data sources and formats. 6.2.3.3 Run-time container The Run-time
    Container executes the model based predictive functions and life-cycle management
    functions within the overall plant infrastructure. It ensures proper deployment
    and execution of predictive functions developed by means of the data lab, hence
    it manages all aspects of predictive functions life cycle. It is composed into
    four sub-components as described below: Data Orchestrator: coordinates the data
    flow between different components, such as transmit input data, store prediction
    result, and pass visualization result data to relevant components. Predictive
    Function: exports predictive function image from Function Repository and instantiate
    the execution of predictive function that perform real-time scoring of input operational
    data. It performs all operations required for the pre-processing of raw data into
    inputs for the specific predictive function and into process prediction output.
    Data Storage: stores the prediction results into a scalable database. The prediction
    results are also sent to the Operational Platform systems and the data lab for
    combining these real-time results with historical data analysis. Visualization
    Dashboard: displays prediction results and generates feedback instructions or
    alerts towards plant’s systems to inform/warn the site operators to adjust the
    process regulation parameters. 6.2.4 Cross Sectorial Data Lab Platform The Data
    Lab provides a collaborative environment where high amounts of data from multiple
    sites, and possibly from multitude of industry sectors, are collected, stored
    and processed in a scalable way. It enables multidisciplinary collaboration of
    experts allowing teams to jointly model, develop and evaluate distributed controls
    in rapid and cost-effective way. The Data Lab eases the definition of predictive
    control and life cycle management functions, allowing to work in a simulated environment
    or to exploit co-simulation by mixing stored data with data flowing in real-time
    from the real systems. The Data Lab thus supports data science and automation
    experts interested to optimization and scheduling aspects by providing the suitable
    environment to mine, process, re-play production data. It allows modelling of
    the whole production process across the SCADA layers including the specification
    of the data dictionary of all inputs and outputs of the processing steps and their
    relations to the overall KPIs. The semantic models capture the site knowledge
    base for given application cases and used data analytics methods allowing generalization
    of cases to existing good practices and transfer of the knowledge by adaptation
    of cases to new environment/site. The main outcome of the Data Lab is typically
    a single or multiple new predictive functions and life cycle management controls
    ready to be deployed in the Runtime Container of the Plant Operations Platform.
    Figure 6.3 Functional View of Cross Sectorial Data Lab Platform. The components
    of the Cross Sectorial Data Lab are shown in Figure 6.3 and explained in the sections
    below. 6.2.4.1 Big data storage & analytics platform The Big Data Storage and
    Analytics Platform provides resources and functionalities for storage as well
    as batch and real-time processing of the operational data from multiple site characterized
    as Big Data. The platform combines and orchestrates existing technologies from
    the Big Data and Analytic landscape and sets a distributed and scalable run-time
    infrastructure for the developed data analytics methods. It provides main integration
    interfaces between the site Operational Platform and the cloud Data Lab platform
    and the programming interfaces for the implementation of the data intensive analytics
    methods. The Big Data Storage and Analytics Platform consist of the following
    sub-components: Distributed Storage: provides a reliable, scalable file system
    with similar interfaces and semantics to access data as local file systems. Distributed
    Database: provides a structured view of the data stored in the platform using
    the standard SQL language, and supports standard RDBMS programming interfaces
    such as JDBC for Java or ODBC for Net platforms. Distributed Data Processing Framework:
    allows the execution of applications in multiple nodes in order to retrieve, classify
    or transform the arriving data. The framework provides Data Analytics APIs for
    processing large datasets via parallel and distributed computations. Data Ingestion:
    implements an interface for real-time communication between the Data Lab and Operation
    platforms. It also supports batch uploading of the historical data between the
    Data Lab and Operation platform. Security & Directory Service: provides user management
    and content authorization capabilities for the platform services. Management &
    Monitoring: provides the management, monitoring and provisioning of the platform
    services on the hosted environment. 6.2.4.2 Model development environment The
    Model Development Environment provides tools and interfaces that cover the whole
    life cycle of planning, implementation, testing, validation and deployment of
    predictive functions and life-cycle management controls into the plant production
    supporting simulation/co-simulation features. Development Tools: provide the main
    collaborative and interactive interface for data engineers, data analysts and
    data scientists to execute and interact with the data processing workflows running
    on the Data Lab platform. Using the provided interface, data scientists can organize,
    execute and share data, and code and visualize results without referring to the
    internal details of the underlying Data Lab run-time infrastructure. The interface
    is integrated in form of analytical “notebooks” where different parts of the analysis
    are logically grouped and presented in one document. These notebooks consist of
    code editors for data processing scripts and SQL queries, and interactive tabular
    or graphical presentations of the processed data. Semantic Modelling Framework:
    provides a common communication language between domain experts, stakeholders
    and data scientists. A collaborative web interface is provided for the creation
    and sharing of semantic models in order to use the knowledge expressed in such
    models for the optimization of the production processes in the Simulation and
    Resource Optimization Framework. Simulation Toolkit: supports validation and deployment
    of predictive functions in order to optimize overall KPIs defined for the production
    process. The estimation of overall impacts can be used to test various “what if”
    scenarios, or for the automatic discrete optimization of the production process
    by finding the optimal combination of predictive functions for various process
    phases. Resource Optimization Toolkit: optimizes the production process based
    on various indicators representing the performance of manufacturing process of
    the plant leveraging process data and knowledge extracted from analytics methods.
    Life-Cycle Management Plugin: serves as multi-disciplinary, transversal tool to
    evaluate environmental performance of a given production process for life-cycle
    environmental indicators, such as Global Warming Potential and Total Energy Requirement.
    Figure 6.4 Components Mapping to Open-source Technologies. 6.2.4.3 Function repository
    The Function Repository provides a storage for predictive functions together with
    all settings required for the deployment of predictive functions, where they are
    available for production deployment or for the simulations and overall optimization
    of the production processes. The predictive functions are packaged as container
    images so that entire predictive function pipeline (including pre-processing and
    task specific evaluation) can be implemented within a virtualized container. 6.2.5
    Deployment The Data Lab Platform promises to combine and orchestrate existing
    technologies and open source frameworks from the Big Data landscape to establish
    a distributed and scalable run-time infrastructure for the data analytics methods.
    We present in Figure 6.4 the mapping of the platform components to existing and
    emerging open source technologies selected and used during the initial deployment.
    The initial deployment was performed with multiple virtual machines on an in-house
    physical infrastructure. It turned out that the overall deployment time and configuration
    management is the most critical aspect in realizing and operationalizing such
    a platform. It would be optimal to devise a uniform deployment strategy taking
    into account different deployment options for the platform such as on-premises,
    cloud/external provider or hybrid. It has also been learned that different demonstrative
    and use-case scenarios in both aluminium and plastic domains pose different infrastructure
    and data requirements. Hence, it is useful to define different deployment pipelines
    or modes for the platform where the right set of platform services are deployed
    and orchestrated accordingly instead of full stack deployment. Towards this goal,
    the Big Data Storage and Analytics Platform has been containerized to adapt a
    common deployment ground with the objective of easing the usage of common platform
    technologies and make integration with other services or applications easy. The
    containerization based on Docker framework is depicted in Figure 6.5. Figure 6.5
    Containerization of Big Data Storage and Analytics Platform. The deployment of
    the Site Operational Platform with open source technologies mainly for Virtual
    Process Industries Resources Adaptor and Run-time Container is finally illustrated
    in Figure 6.6. It shows how predictive functions can be applied in factorial settings.
    Figure 6.6 Deployment view of Plant Operational Platform. 6.2.6 Data Analysis
    Data analysis in process industries mainly aims to reduce the wastage of time,
    resource and energy during production processes. This can be achieved by several
    means: avoiding equipment stoppages, maintaining optimum configurations, early
    detection of a chain of events causing an anomaly etc. Data analysis is simplified
    by the components of the Cross Sectorial Data Lab which provides a single platform
    for data fetching, accessing and artefact development. The data collected from
    the plastic molding machines are stored in the Big Data Storage & Analytic Platform.
    These data are used by the data scientists and the process experts for exploratory
    analysis in order to gain initial insights. The collaborative interface provided
    by the platform is used simultaneously by the process expert and the data scientists.
    The findings from the exploratory analysis is used as the basis for modelling
    the process leading to the development of predictive functions. These functions
    are stored in the Function Repository which are deployed later in factory premises
    for real-time predictions. Although this process is generic enough to be applied
    in any kind of industrial environment, we shall limit our discussion to the plastic
    industry. The objective of data analysis in the plastic industry is to anticipate
    the breakdowns and/or highlight equipment/process deviation that impacts the injection
    molding process and therefore to improve the quality of the produced coffee capsules.
    In general, there are two areas where waste parts can occur in plastic injection
    molding process: the molding tool and the molding process. During the long-term
    production of the coffee capsules, parameters of the injection molding process
    can slightly change due to various changes of the environment (temperature and
    humidity in the factory, deviations in the energy supply system, heating of oil
    temperature, deviations in the quality of the plastic granules, wearing of machine
    parts). The aim is to monitor technical parameters of the molding machine and
    raise an alarm if the deviation is increasing over the defined values. These long-term
    changes can also cause the stoppage of molding machines. Which in turn causes
    reduction of produced capsules. In addition, few of the initial cycles after restart
    are wasted during the calibration process producing defective capsules. 6.2.6.1
    Data description Two kinds of data have been collected in the first year from
    GLN site during the production of coffee capsules. The first data set is collected
    automatically from a Euromap63 interface recorded on molding machines and the
    second data set is collected during the experiments conducted by a process expert
    during their visit to the production site. The first data set is unlabeled and
    contains sensor measurements of several coffee capsule production cycles. Each
    cycle lasts almost 7 seconds, except if it causes a breakdown. The data set has
    a total of 88 attributes representing temperatures, time taken for different stages,
    pressure, cylinder positions etc. All data were directly monitored by the injection
    molding machine and stored there. Of them, only 12 (heating belt temperatures,
    maximum cycle pressure, coolant temperatures, residual melt cushion, plastification
    time) are proposed as useful, and, particularly, their ranges/deviations over
    intervals instead of their values themselves are suggested to serve as explanatory
    variables. The second data set [1] is manually labelled and comprises information
    about 250 production cycles of coffee capsules from the injection molding machine
    and their quality information. It contains 36 attributes reflecting the machine’s
    internal sensor measurements for each cycle. These measurements include values
    about the internal states, e.g. temperature and pressure values, as well as timings
    about the different phases within each cycle. In addition, we also take into account
    quality information for each cycle, i.e., the number of non-defect coffee capsules
    which changes throughout individual production cycles. The quality of each capsule
    is inspected by the domain expert in different aspects. i.e. the capsules have
    permissible range of height and base diameter. Also each capsule should have uniform
    thickness and should not have holes. If any of these expectations are not met,
    the capsule is considered to be defective. If the number of produced high quality
    coffee capsules is larger than a predefined threshold, we label the corresponding
    cycle with high.quality, and otherwise we assign the label low.quality. The decision
    about the quality labels was made by domain experts. Exploratory analysis is performed
    on the unlabeled data in order to discover hidden insights. On the other hand,
    basic machine learning algorithms are applied to the labelled data to classify
    the cycles based on their quality. In the upcoming subsections we discuss these
    two different approaches on these data sets. 6.2.6.2 Preliminary trend analysis
    of unlabeled data The main aim of the preliminary analysis of is to get some initial
    overall insights that might be interesting for the process experts to be further
    analyzed. The first step was to understand the attributes and their correlations.
    This was followed by visual exploration of data with manual inspection followed
    by clustering the data to find significant relation between different cycles.
    Considering the huge amount of data generated by sensors, clustering usually takes
    lots of time. One strategy is to use the computation powers of the Data Lab clusters
    to perform these operations faster. If the algorithms for exploratory data analysis
    are deployed in the Data Lab, domain experts and data scientists can use the results
    simultaneously to get actionable insights. One of the insight was repeating set
    of parameters in the data. This was found by using matrix profiles. A pattern
    obtained by applying matrix profiles is the decrease in plastification time and
    at the same time, increase in cycle time. Plastic domain expert cross checked
    these patterns and found out that this happens whenever there is an equipment
    stoppage due to lack of lubrication. Though the characteristics of these incidents
    are known, early prediction of the possible stoppage has not been found out with
    data analysis. The corresponding patterns are shown in Figure 6.7. Figure 6.7
    Increase in cycle time and decrease in plastification at the same time. The same
    pattern has repeated multiple times in the unlabelled set of plastic data. CycCycTim
    is cycle time and CycPlstTim is plastification time. Preliminary trend analysis
    helps us to extract the knowledge hidden in voluminous unlabelled data sets. This
    process can be automated to get the best results in minimum time. In addition,
    in the MONSOON project we include many stakeholders such as process experts, machine
    supervisors and ground workers to actively contribute to the production process
    optimization. This is achieved with the help of a centralized Big Data analytics
    platform. On deploying the knowledge discovery algorithms in the Big Data analytics
    platform, the stakeholders can give live feedbacks. The data scientists further
    use these feedbacks for deriving conclusions. This is an ongoing work as part
    of the project. 6.2.6.3 Machine learning for labelled data The goal of the machine
    learning process is to classify the injection molding cycles to high and low-quality
    cycles. As discussed earlier, the cycles are labelled as high.quality or low.quality
    based on the number of defective capsules produced in a cycle beyond a threshold
    defined by the process expert. The initial dataset is pre-processed as follows.
    The labelled data is first centred and scaled. Later, the number of attributes
    is reduced by excluding the ones with near zero variance. Principal Component
    Analysis is applied to the remaining attributes to get the projection of data
    in reduced number of dimensions. Basic classification algorithms, namely, k-Nearest
    Neighbour, Naïve Bayes, Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Random Forests
    and Support vector Machines (SVM) are investigated on the pre-processed data.
    SVM is investigated both with linear and RBF kernels. The performance of the models
    are measured in terms of balanced accuracy, precision, recall and F1 scores. K-fold
    cross validation is used to evaluate the performance. The number of folds is set
    to 5 and the number of repetitions is set to 100. We used 80% of the dataset is
    for training and 20% for testing. This investigation is performed via the CARET
    package in the programming language R. The results of our performance evaluation
    are summarized in Table 6.1. Table 6.1 Classification results of different predictive
    models Balanced Accuracy Precision Recall F1 score k-NN 0.697 0.638 0.686 0.657
    Naïve Bayes 0.643 0.604 0.563 0.578 CART 0.637 0.595 0.566 0.573 Random Forest
    0.653 0.619 0.570 0.589 SVM (linear) 0.632 0.626 0.488 0.540 SVM (RBF) 0.663 0.643
    0.563 0.594 From the table above, we see that all predictive models reach an accuracy
    of minimum 63%. The highest accuracy is achieved by the k-Nearest Neighbour classifier
    predicting the correct quality labels for more than 69% of the data. Albeit these
    results were satisfying, these algorithms cannot be deployed straight away as
    the data used for this performance evaluation has been manually labelled by the
    experts. In the situations where the capsules are produced in millions per day,
    it is wiser to use the automatically labelled data for training the models and
    deploy them afterwards. One approach is to use the decision of the visual inspection
    systems in order to label the data. But this is not trivial since there is no
    one to one mapping between the optical inspection systems data and the actual
    cycle data. This is because multiple capsules belonging to different cycles and
    machines are passed to the automatic visual inspection system at once making it
    harder to identify individual cycles belonging to a particular machine. 6.2.7
    Summary In this section, we have presented our recent research activities within
    the scope of the EU project MONSOON: As an example for the process industry, we
    have described the overall reference architecture facilitating cross-sectorial
    data analytics. As part of our ongoing work, we have also highlighted the analysis
    of sensor data arising from the plastic industry sector. In the following section,
    we will focus on the manufacturing industry. 6.3 Manufacturing/Discrete Industry
    6.3.1 Introduction As an example for the manufacturing industry, we focus on the
    EU project COMPOSITION. This project addresses the requirements of modern production
    processes, which stress the need of greater agility and flexibility leading to
    faster production cycles, increased productivity, less waste and more sustainable
    production. At the factory level, decisions need to be supported by detailed knowledge
    about the production process and its interplay with external entities. Unfortunately,
    historical and live data that generates this knowledge is becoming more and more
    distributed and few solutions are available that can easily tackle the implied
    challenges. Moreover, factories are becoming less isolated in the productive tissue
    of nations and several suppliers and third-party service providers need to be
    contacted and coordinated to implement decisions taken at the factory level. In
    such a worldwide and dynamic environment, the ability of automatizing the preliminary
    coordination and negotiation activities involved in setting up supply chains for
    specific needs, in an open marketplace-like fashion, could greatly improve the
    ability of factories to quickly react to external challenges and driving forces.
    6.3.2 Intra-factory Interoperability Layer Part of the COMPOSITION Architecture
    In this chapter, we will address the COMPOSITION architecture in the data analytics
    context. The intra-factory interoperability layer has two main goals: the first
    one is to provide an infrastructure to combine distributed data in the integrated
    information management system and to do data analytics, the second one is to ensure
    the conformity between communications among interconnected components. Figure
    6.8 shows the relevant part of the architecture. Figure 6.8 Intra-factory interoperability
    layer components and dependencies. The components of the architecture are introduced
    and described in the following: The BMS is provided by a project development stakeholder
    and is the translation layer providing shop floor connectivity from sensors to
    the COMPOSITION system. Raw data storage is added for oﬄine debug purposes. The
    Middleware is the main recipient in which the interoperability of single components
    act. LinkSmart is a well-known middleware solution per se and is customized to
    satisfy the requirements of the COMPOSITION project. LinkSmart comprises the following
    components: The Service Catalog works as service index and provides security information
    for service intercommunication. The Event Aggregator parses messages to ensure
    homogeneity in data streams. Keycloak is a virtual layer that ensures authorization
    and authentication. Like all security related measures, it is deployed by the
    Security Framework. The broker-based intra-factory communication system manages
    all internal communication. The Big Data Analytics component provides Complex
    Event Processing (CEP) capabilities for the data provided by the intra-factory
    integration layer The Hidden Storage is an optional storage not accessible from
    the outside in which aggregated data are stored for debug purposes, i.e. re-bootstrapping
    already trained artificial neural networks belonging to the Deep Learning Toolkit
    and to the Dynamic Reasoning Engine. The Visual Analytics component is the reporting
    interface of the Decision Support System and Simulation and Forecasting Toolkit.
    The Dynamic Reasoning Engine is part of the Simulation and Forecasting Toolkit.
    The Decision Support System uses process models to guide the production process.
    Having a fist overview of the components of the COMPOSITION project and their
    dependencies, we continue with describing our approach to smart data analysis
    in the following section. 6.3.3 The Complex-Event Machine Learning methodology
    Manufacturing in assembly lines consist of a set of hundreds, thousands or millions
    of small discrete steps aligned in a production process. Automatized production
    processes or production lines thereby produce for each of those steps small bits
    of data in form of events. Although the events possess valuable information, this
    information loses its value over time. Additionally, the data in the events usually
    are meaningless if they are not contextualized, either by other events, sensor
    data or process context. To extract most value of the data, it must be processed
    as it is produced, to be more precise in real-time and on demand. Therefore, in
    case of Big Data Analyses we propose the usage of Complex-Event Processing for
    the data management coming from the production facilities. In this manner, the
    data is processed in the moment when it is produced, extracting the maximum value,
    reducing latency, providing reactivity, giving it context and avoiding the need
    of archiving unnecessary data. The Complex-Event Processing service is provided
    by the LinkSmart® Learning Agent (LA). The LA is a Stream Mining service that
    provides the utilities to manage real-time data for several purposes. On the one
    hand, the LA provides a set of tools to collect, annotate, filter, aggregate,
    or cache the real-time data incoming from the production facilities. This set
    of tools facilitates the possibility to build applications on top of real-time
    data. On the other hand, the LA provides a set of APIs to manage the real-time
    data lifecycle for continuous learning. Moreover, the LA can process the live
    data to provide complex analysis creating real-time results for alerting or informing
    about important conditions in the factory, that may be not be seen at first glance.
    Finally, the LA allows the possibility to adapt to the productions needs during
    the production process. The Complex-Event Machine Learning (CEML) [2] is a framework
    that combines Complex-Event Processing (CEP) [3] and Machine Learning (ML) [4]
    applied to the IoT. This means that the framework was developed to be deployed
    everywhere, from the edge of the network to the cloud. Furthermore, the framework
    can manage itself and works autonomously. The following section briefly describes
    the different aspects that CEML covers. The framework must automate the learning
    process and the deployment management. This process can be broken down in different
    phases: (1) the data must be collected from different sensors, either from the
    same device or in a local network. (2) The data must be pre-processed for attribute
    extraction. (3) The learning process takes place. (4) The learning must be evaluated.
    (5) When the evaluation shows that the model is ready, the deployment must take
    place. Finally, all these phases happen continuously and repetitively, while the
    environment constantly changes. Therefore, the model and the deployment must adapt
    as well. 6.3.3.1 Learning agents architecture We utilize LinkSmart® LA following
    a modular architecture with loosely coupled modules responsible for different
    tasks. Figure 6.9 illustrates the architecture of the LA. The data and commands
    come via communication protocols implemented by Connectors (Figure 6.9 shows two
    example implementations, REST and MQTT). The connectors transfer the information
    to the Feeders, which process the data accordingly to the API logic. This logic
    depends on whether it is an insertion of new raw data, request of simple data
    processing (statement) or a machine learning request (CEML request). The data
    is inserted into the execution environment (in this case EsperEngine [1]), while
    the data processing requests are deployed in the same engine for the processing
    of the raw data. The CEML request has a more complex behaviour. Each CEML request
    is managed by its own CEMLManager, which contains and coordinates the model(s),
    evaluator for each model, and several statements. Finally, all output of any process
    (Statement) in the execution pipeline (EsperEngine) is captured or managed by
    a Handler. If the process should be prepared and sent through a communication
    protocol, then it will be handled by a Complex-Event Handler: An Asynchronous
    Handler, if the protocol is asynchronous (e.g. MQTT); or Synchronous Handler,
    if the protocol is synchronous (e.g. HTTP). [1] Esper is an open-source Java-based
    software product for Complex event processing (CEP) and Event stream processing
    (ESP) that analyzes series of events for deriving conclusions from them. See http://www.espertech.com/
    Figure 6.9 LinkSmart® Learning Service Architecture sketch. 6.3.3.2 Data propagation
    phase Data in the IoT is produced in several places, protocols, formats, and devices.
    Although this article does not address the problem of data heterogeneity in detail,
    the learning agents require a mechanism to acquire and manage the heterogeneity
    of the data. The mechanism must be scalable and, at the same time, the protocol
    should handle the asynchronous nature of IoT. Finally, the protocol must provide
    tools to handle the pub/sub characteristics of the CEP engines. Therefore, we
    have chosen MQTT [2], a well-established Client Server publish/subscribe messaging
    transport protocol. The topic based message protocol provides a mechanism to manage
    the data heterogeneity by making a relation between topics and payloads. It allows
    deployments in several architectures, OS, and hardware platforms; basic constraints
    at the edge of the network. The protocol is payload agnostic and as such allows
    for maximum flexibility to support several types of payloads. [2] MQTT is a machine-to-machine
    (M2M)/“Internet of Things” connectivity protocol. Source http://mqtt.org/ 6.3.3.3
    Data pre-processing (munging) phase Usually ML is tied to stored datasets, which
    incurs several drawbacks. Firstly, the learning can take place only with persistent
    data. Secondly, usually the models generated are based on historical data, not
    current data. Both constrains, in the IoT, have direct consequences. It is neither
    feasible nor profitable to store all data. In addition, embedded devices do not
    have much storage capacity, which makes it impossible to use ML algorithms on
    them. Furthermore, IoT deployments are commonly exposed to ever-changing environments.
    Using historical data for off-line learning could cause outdated models to learn
    old patterns rather than current ones, producing drifted models. Although some
    IoT platforms like COMPOSITION support storage of historical data, it may be too
    time and space consuming to create large enough times series. Therefore, there
    is also a need for non-persistence manipulation tools. This is precisely what
    the CEP engine provides in the CEML framework. This means, the CEP engine decides
    which data and how the data is manipulated using predefined CEP statements deployed
    in the engine. Each statement can be seen as a topic, to which each learning model
    is subscribed. Any update of the subscribers provides a sample to be learnt in
    the learning phase. 6.3.3.4 Learning phase There is no pre-selection of algorithms
    in the framework. They are selected by the restrictions imposed by the problem
    domain. For example, in extreme constrained devices, algorithms such as Algorithm
    Output Granularity (AOG) [5] may be the right choice. In other cases where the
    model changes quickly, one-shot algorithms may be the best fit. Artificial Neural
    Networks are good for complex problems but only with stable phenomena. This means
    that the algorithm selection should be made case-by-case. Our framework provides
    mechanisms for the management and deployment of the learning models, and the process
    of how the model is fed with samples. In general, the process is based on incremental
    learning [6] albeit with online and non-persistent data. The process can be summarized
    as follows: the samples, without the target provided in the last phase, are used
    to generate a prediction. The prediction will then be sent to the next phase.
    Thereafter, the sample is applied to update the model. Thus, all updates are used
    for the learning process. 6.3.3.5 Continuous validation phase This section describes
    how the validation of the learning models is done inside the CEML. This phase
    does not influence the learning process nor validate the CEML framework itself.
    ML model validation is a challenging topic in real-time environments and the evaluation
    for distributed environments or embedded devices is not addressed extensively
    in the literature, which is why we think it needs further research. There are
    two addressed strategies. Either we holdout an evaluation dataset by taking a
    control subset for given time-frame (time window), or we use Predictive Sequential,
    also known as Prequential [7], in which we assess each sequential prediction against
    the observation. The following section describes the continuous validation we
    applied for a classification problem, even though it can be applied for other
    cases as well. Instead of accumulating a sample for validation, we analyse the
    predictions made before the learning takes place. All predictions are assessed
    each time an update arrives. The assessment is an entry for the confusion matrix
    [8], which is accumulated in an accumulated confusion matrix. The matrix contains
    the accumulation of all assessed predictions done before. In other words, the
    matrix does not describe the current validation state of the model, but instead
    the trajectory of it. Using this matrix, the accumulated validation metrics (e.g.
    Accuracy, Precision, Sensitivity, etc.) are being calculated. This methodology
    does have some drawbacks and advantages, explained more extensively in [9]. 6.3.3.6
    Deployment phase The continuous validation opens the possibility for making an
    assessment of the status of the model each time a new update arrives, e.g. if
    it is accrued or not. Using this information, the CEML framework has the capability
    to decide if the model should or should not be deployed into the system at any
    time. If the model is behaving well, then it should be deployed, otherwise it
    should be removed from the deployment. The decision is made by user-provided thresholds
    w.r.t. evaluation metrics. If a threshold is reached, the CEML inserts the model
    into the CEP engine and starts processing the streams using the model. Otherwise,
    if the model do not reach the threshold, it is removed from the CEP engine. 6.3.3.7
    Assessment In [6] 13 issues for learning in the IoT where left open. The CEML
    framework addresses 10 out of the 13 challenges as follows: Handling the continuous
    flow of data streams: This is done by the stream statements inside the CEP engine
    using continuous streams for learning an evaluating. Unbounded memory requirements:
    The use of CEP engines in stream windows allows the intelligent usage of the memory
    as is needed, dropping it otherwise. Transferring data mining results over a wireless
    network with limited bandwidth: This is partially handled. MQTT is a reliable
    low-bandwidth lightweight protocol developed for satellite monitoring of pipelines.
    Nevertheless, this paper does not address the physical layer. Modelling changes
    of mining results over time: The CEML is a continuous automatic learning mechanism.
    The learning models will adjust as they learn. Interactive mining environment
    to satisfy user requirements: The IoT Learning agent provide an REST API. Thus,
    update the learning request is possible, as well as, obtaining live or on-demand
    updates. Integration between data-stream management systems and ubiquitous data-stream
    mining approaches: The CEML provides a REST API for managing each kind of request
    independently. Thus, the learning request can be managed as a whole, including
    the involved streams. Besides, the streams can be managed individually as single
    stream statement. Additionally, the MQTT API provides a multi-cast API so that
    in distributed multi-agent deployment, the agents can be managed as one, as groups,
    or as one entity. The relationship between the proposed techniques and the needs
    of real-world applications: Legal, ethical and technical reasons are part of the
    motivation. E.g. the storage constrains or the legal constraints in the health
    domain. Data pre-processing in the stream-mining process: This is handled in the
    pre-processing phase of the CEML. The technological issue of mining data streams:
    The implementation presented here shows that the system behaves in a real-time
    environment. The formalization of real-time accuracy evaluation: This is addressed
    by the Double-Tumble-Window Evaluation. In addition to the Complex-Event Machine
    Learning approach based on the open-source IoT platform LinkSmart, we also describe
    another approach carried out in the scope of the project COMPOSITION in the next
    section. 6.3.4 Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in Production Lines In addition
    to the previously introduced framework, which primarily allows for an exploitation
    of supervised machine learning algorithms, this chapter focuses on an alternative
    unsupervised approach that was also implemented in the scope of the project COMPOSITION.
    This method was used as a further extension to optimize the detection of machine
    errors in production lines at early stages. In the last couple of years, the importance
    of cyber-physical systems in order to optimize industry processes, has led to
    a significant increase of sensorized production environments. Data collected in
    this context allows for new intelligent solutions to e.g. support decision processes
    or to enable predictive maintenance. One problem related to the latter case is
    the detection of anomalies in the behaviour of machines without any kind of predefined
    ground truth. This fact is further complicated, if a reconfiguration of machine
    parameters is done on-the-fly, due to varying requirements of multiple items processed
    by the same production line. As a consequence, a change of adjustable parameters
    in most cases directly leads to divergent measurements, even though those observations
    should not be regarded as anomalies. In the scope of the project COMPOSITION,
    the task of detecting anomalies for predictive maintenance within historical sensor
    data from a real reflow oven was investigated. While the oven is used for soldering
    surface mount electronic components to printed circuit boards based on continuously
    changing recipes, one related problem was the unsupervised recognition of potential
    misbehaviours of the oven resulting from erroneous components. The utilized data
    set comprises information about the heat and power consumption of individual fans.
    Apart from additional machine parameters like a predefined heat value for each
    section of the oven, it contains time-annotated sensor observations and process
    information recorded over a period of more than seven years. As one solution for
    this problem, we will present our approach named Generic Anomaly Detection for
    Production Lines, short GADPL. The hereafter-presented description of GADPL is
    based on the stage-wise implementation of the algorithm. After an initial clustering
    of similar input parameters and a consecutive segmentation, we will discuss the
    representation of individual segments and the corresponding measurement of dissimilarity.
    6.3.4.1 Configuration clustering In many companies, as well as in the case of
    the project COMPOSITION, a single production line is often used to produce multiple
    items according to different requirements. Those requirements are in general defined
    by varying machine configurations consisting of one or more adjustable parameters,
    which are changed ‘on-the-fly’ during runtime. For a detection of deviations with
    respect to some default behaviour of a machine, this fact raises the problem of
    invalid comparisons between sensor measurements of dissimilar configurations.
    If a measurement or an interval of measurements is identified as an anomaly, it
    should only be considered as such, if this observation is related to the same
    configuration as observations representing the default behaviour. Therefore in
    advance to all subsequent steps, at first all sensor measurements have to be clustered
    according to their associated configuration. For the sake of simplicity, we are
    only discussing the process within a single cluster in the following subsections,
    although one has to keep in mind that each step is done in parallel for all clusters.
    6.3.4.2 Segmentation As a result of the configuration-based clustering, the data
    is already segmented coarsely. However, since this approach describes unsupervised
    anomaly detection, the idea of a further segmentation is to create some kind of
    ground truth, which reflects the default behaviour of a machine. In this section,
    we will see how the segmentation is utilized to implement this idea. In an initial
    step, a maximum segmentation length is defined, in order to specify the time horizon,
    after which an anomaly can be detected. Assuming a sampling rate of 5 mins per
    sensor, the maximum length of a segment would consequently be (60 × 24)/5 = 288
    to describe the behaviour on a daily basis. Although a decrease of the segment
    length implies a decrease of response time, it also increases the computational
    complexity and makes the detection more sensitive to invalid sensor measurements.
    In this context, it needs to be mentioned that in this stage segments are also
    spitted, if they are not continuous with respect to time as a result of missing
    values. Another fact that has to be considered is the transition time of configuration
    changes. While the input parameters associated with a configuration change directly,
    the observations might adapt more slowly and therefore blur the expressiveness
    of the new segment. To prevent this from happening, the transition part of all
    segments, which have been created due to configuration changes, is truncated.
    If segments become smaller than a predefined threshold, they can be ignored in
    the upcoming phases. 6.3.4.3 Feature extraction Having a set of segments for each
    configuration, the next step is to determine the characteristics of all segments.
    While the literature presents multiple approaches to describe the behaviour of
    time series, we will focus on common statistical features extracted from each
    segment. Nonetheless, the choice of features is not fixed, which is why any feature
    suitable for the individual application scenario can be used. One example for
    rather complex features could be the result of a kernel fitting in the context
    of Gaussian processes, accepting a decrease in performance. Since the goal is
    to capture comparable characteristics of a segment, we compute different real-valued
    features and combine them in a vectorised representation. In the case of the project
    COMPOSITION, we used the mean to describe the average level, the variance as a
    measure of fluctuation and the lower and upper quartiles as a coarse distribution-binning
    of values. Due to the expressiveness of features being dependent from the actual
    data, one possible way to optimize the selection of features is the Principal
    Component Analysis. Simply using a large number of features to best possibly cover
    the variety of characteristics might have a negative influence on the measurement
    of dissimilarity. The reason for this is the partial consideration of irrelevant
    features within distance computations. Moreover, since thresholds could be regarded
    as a more intuitive solution compared to additionally extracted features, this
    replacement would lead to a significant decrease in the number of recognized anomalies.
    Apart from the sensitivity to outliers, the reason is a neglect of the inherent
    behaviour of a time series. As an example, consider the measurements of an acoustic
    sensor attached to a motor that recently is sending fluctuating measurements,
    yet within the predefined tolerance. Although the recorded values are still considered
    as valid, the fluctuation with respect to the volume could already indicate a
    nearly defect motor. Finally, one initially needs to evaluate appropriate thresholds
    for any parameter of each configuration. 6.3.4.4 Dissimilarity measurement So
    far, we have discussed the exploitation of inherent information, extracted from
    segmented time series. The final step of GADPL is to measure the level of dissimilarity
    for all obtained representatives. Since no ground truth is available to define
    the default behaviour for a specific configuration, the algorithm uses an approximation
    based on the given data. One problem in this regard is the variability of a default
    behaviour, consisting of more than one pattern. Therefore, a naive approach as
    choosing the most occurring representative, would already fail for a time series
    consisting of two equally appearing patterns captured by different segments, where
    consequently half of the data would be detected as anomalous behaviour. As one
    potential solution GADPL instead uses the mean over a specified size of nearest
    neighbours, depicting the most similar behaviour according to each segment. The
    idea is that even though there might multiple distinct characteristics in the
    data, at least a predefined number of elements represent the same behaviour compared
    to the processed item. Otherwise, this item will even have a high average dissimilarity
    with respect to the most similar observations and can therefore be classified
    as anomaly. Here, for the vectorised feature representations, any suitable distance
    function is applicable. In the context of the project COMPOSITION we decided to
    use the Euclidean distance for a uniform distribution of weights, applied to normalized
    feature values. To further increase the performance of nearest neighbour queries,
    we exploited the R*-tree as a high-dimensional index structure. Given the dissimilarity
    for each individual representative together with a predefined anomaly threshold,
    GADPL finally emits potential candidates having an anomalous behaviour. Figure
    6.10 Example application of GADPL. The application of GADPL is illustrated in
    Figure 6.10. The upper part shows the segmentation of time annotated power consumption
    data in percent. The lower part illustrates the result of the dissimilarity measurement,
    where the red rectangle indicates classified anomalies. 6.3.5 Summary In this
    section, we have presented our recent research activities within the scope of
    the EU project COMPOSITION. As an example for the manufacturing industry, we have
    briefly described the COMPOSITION architecture along with one of its main components:
    the open-source IoT platform Link-Smart. As part of our ongoing work, we have
    also described our corresponding research activities regarding the analysis of
    sensor data from manufacturing industry. 6.4 Summary and Conclusions In this work,
    we have given insights into our recent research activities with regard to the
    domains of Smart Data and Industrial Internet of Things. To this end, we have
    focused on the EU projects MONSOON and COMPOSITION as examples for the Public-Private
    Partnership (PPP) initiatives Factories of the Future (FoF) and Sustainable Process
    Industry (SPIRE). We have shown two different but conceptually similar architectures
    for scalable and agile data analytics. In addition, we have provided an overview
    of our recent Smart Data activities and have exemplified ongoing data-driven analysis
    of industrial production processes from the process and manufacturing industries.
    We conclude that data-driven investigations, either applied in process industry
    or manufacturing industry, require a solid platform for handling data analytics
    at scale. The proposed architecture of the Cross Sectorial Data Lab in combination
    with the open-source IoT platform LinkSmart seem to be promising developments,
    which are applicable to any industrial sector. Acknowledgements The projects underlying

    The chapter presents an overview of the eight that are part of the European IoT
    Security and Privacy Projects initiative (IoT-ESP) addressing advanced concepts
    for end-to-end security in highly distributed, heterogeneous and dynamic IoT environments.
    The approaches presented are holistic and include identification and authentication,
    data protection and prevention against cyber-attacks at the device and system
    levels. The projects present architectures, concepts, methods and tools for open
    IoT platforms integrating evolving sensing, actuating, energy harvesting, networking
    and interface technologies. Platforms should provide connectivity and intelligence,
    actuation and control features, linkage to modular and ad-hoc cloud services,
    The IoT platforms used are compatible with existing international developments
    addressing object identity management, discovery services, virtualisation of objects,
    devices and infrastructures and trusted IoT approaches. 7.1 BRAIN-IoT 7.1.1 BRAIN-IoT
    Project Vision In line with the optimistic forecasts released in last years, Internet
    of Things (IoT) products and services are being more and more deployed in mass-market
    and professional usage scenarios, becoming a reality in our day-by-day life. Commercial
    and pilot deployments world-wide are progressively demonstrating the value of
    IoT solutions in real conditions, but also rising some concerns with respect to
    dependability, security, privacy and safety constraints. The IoT technology and
    market landscape will become increasingly complex in the longer term i.e. 10+
    years from now, especially after IoT technologies will have proven their full
    potential in business-critical and privacy-sensitive scenarios. An important shift
    is expected to happen as technology evolutions will allow to safely employ IoT
    systems in scenarios involving actuation and characterized by stricter requirements
    in terms of dependability, security, privacy and safety constraints, resulting
    in convergence between IoT and Cyber Physical Systems (CPS). Attracted by the
    trend, several organizations have started studying how to employ IoT systems also
    to support tasks involving actuation and control in business-critical conditions,
    resulting in a demand for more dependable and “smart” IoT systems. However, in
    order to turn such vision in reality, many issues must still be faced, including:
    Heterogeneity and (lack of) interoperability: a wide number of IoT platforms exist
    on the market, both cloud-based and locally hosted. Standardization and open-source
    initiatives are facilitating convergence among available platforms, which now
    employ similar usage patterns and increasingly converging sets of protocols, APIs,
    device models and data interchange formats. Nevertheless, full interoperability
    across platform still needs to be tackled on a case by case, platform by platform
    basis, due the wide amount of possible applications, design choices, customization
    options, formats and configurations that can be adopted by IoT developers and
    adopters. Difficulty of implementing “Smart Behaviours” in open collaboration
    context: while Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques
    are rapidly evolving to provide smart behaviours and solutions to increasingly
    complex problems, it is intrinsically difficult to generically “bind” such solutions
    to generic concrete IoT and CPS platforms and to make them collaborate for common
    tasks, since possible interactions between platforms remain unforeseen a priori.
    Security and safety: the distributed nature of IoT makes enforcement of good security
    practices intrinsically challenging. The market asks for IoT solutions suitable
    to safely support business-critical tasks, which can be deployed rapidly and with
    low costs. The emerging availability of actuation features in IoT systems calls
    for stricter security requirements. Nevertheless, many of today’s IoT-based products
    are implemented with low awareness of potential security risks. As a result, many
    IoT products lack even basic, state-of-the-art security mechanisms, resulting
    in critical effects when such flaws deployed to mass-market scenarios. Enforcement
    of Privacy and Data Ownership policies: as IoT products are increasingly purchased
    and deployed by corporate and private users in their homes, work places, factories
    and commercial areas, privacy issues and violations become more frequent. While
    policies are quickly catching up by enforcing a suitable framework of rules within
    the EU, a comprehensive solution able to give back control of privacy aspects
    to users is still missing – creating significant issues when unaware users accept
    that their data is moved in foreign countries, outside the safe shield provided
    by EU regulations. Business models colliding with long-term resilience and survivability
    of IoT services: many IoT solutions on the market adopt fully centralized, cloud-oriented
    approaches. This is often done e.g. to ensure that customers’ devices are forced
    to use forever a single commercial back-end service. Such lock-in approaches create
    artificial monopolies, negatively affecting user rights and the overall market
    competitiveness. This practice introduces singular point of failures in IoT systems,
    making survivability and resiliency features difficult to be granted in the long
    term, therefore sometimes resulting in negative experiences for end users. Market
    Fragmentation and incumbency of large players: the current market of IoT platform
    solution is still affected by fragmentation among the many IoT platforms available
    each focused in specific application domain or associated technology stacks. Moreover,
    some market segments (i.e. the cloud-based IoT platforms market) are notably dominated
    by few dominant players – often based outside the EU, thus hampering the potential
    business opportunities for EU companies. While EU-based initiatives and policies
    are doing significant amount of work to tackle such issues, often with very positive
    results, solutions suitable to tackle challenges arising for futuristic IoT usage
    scenarios are still missing. Future critical issues may be hiding under the hood
    already now and be ready to appear in the close future, putting at stake user
    acceptance and the credibility of the whole eco-system of IoT solutions vendors,
    integrators and adopters and hindering wider adoption of IoT solutions in potentially
    valuable markets. 7.1.2 Objectives In order to tackle the aforementioned challenges,
    the BRAIN-IoT (model-Based fRamework for dependable sensing and Actuation in INtelligent
    decentralized IoT systems) project focuses on complex scenarios, where actuation
    and control are cooperatively supported by populations of heterogeneous IoT systems.
    In such a complex context, many initiatives fall into the temptation of developing
    new IoT platforms, protocols, models or tools aiming to deliver the ultimate solution
    that will solve all the IoT challenges and become “the” reference IoT platform
    or standard. Instead, usually they result in the creation of “yet-another” IoT
    solution or standard. BRAIN-IoT will establish the principle that future IoT applications
    should never be supported by a single, unique, irreplaceable IoT platform. Rather
    future IoT services should exist within a federated/evolving environment that
    not only leverages current Industry Standards but is also capable of adapting
    to embrace future unforeseen industry developments. BRAIN-IoT aims at demonstrating
    that the lack of a single IoT standard and platform, which is generally recognized
    as the most notable weakness of IoT, can be turned into a strength and a guarantee
    for market competitiveness and user protection – if the proper framework for IoT
    dynamicity, security and privacy is in place. The breakthrough targeted by BRAIN-IoT
    is to establish a practical framework and methodology suitable to enable smart
    cooperative behaviour in fully de-centralized, composable and dynamic federations
    of heterogeneous IoT platforms. BRAIN-IoT builds on model-based approaches and
    open industry standards and aims at supporting rapid development and deployment
    of applications and services in professional usage scenarios characterized by
    strict constraints in terms of dependability, safety, security and privacy. The
    BRAIN-IoT vision is realized through seven Technical Objectives (TOs), as described
    in Table 7.1. Table 7.1 BRAIN-IoT technical objectives Technical Objective (TO)
    Description TO1: to enforce interoperability across heterogeneous IoT devices
    autonomously cooperating in complex tasks. BRAIN-IoT approach to interoperability
    is based on the adoption of shared semantic models, dynamically linked to concrete
    IoT devices (sensors, actuators, controls, etc.) operating autonomously in complex
    scenarios. Binding of models to concrete implementations leverages mapping to
    open industry standards for semantic device description. TO2: to enable dynamic
    smart autonomous behaviour involving actuation in IoT scenarios Building upon
    shared models (TO1) BRAIN-IoT facilitates the deployment of smart cooperative
    behaviour, realized by means of modular AI/ML features which can be dynamically
    deployed to heterogeneous IoT devices in mixed edge/cloud IoT environments. Smart
    behaviour features are enriched by distributed data processing, federated learning,
    virtualization/aggregation of data/events/objects, resolution of mixed-criticality
    situations and conflicts, verification and context-aware self-adaptation of connectivity
    and real-time event-oriented, reactive approaches. TO3: to enable the emergence
    of highly dynamic federations of heterogeneous IoT platforms able to support secure
    and scalable operations for future IoT use cases This is achieved by leveraging
    fully de-centralized peer-to-peer approaches providing linkage between modular,
    ad-hoc IoT self-hosted and cloud-based services through existing open standards.
    TO4: to establish Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) in dynamic,
    distributed IoT scenarios BRAIN-IoT introduces a holistic end-to-end trust framework
    for IoT platforms suitable to be employed in scenarios characterized by strict
    security and safety requirements, associated with actuation and semi-autonomous
    operations, and by special needs for secure identification, authentication of
    data and devices, encryption, non-deniability, as well as detection of cyber-attacks
    and protection against them. This is done by adopting established security protocols,
    joint with distributed security approaches derived by peer-to-peer systems e.g.
    block-chain. TO5: to provide solutions to embed privacy-awareness and privacy
    control features in IoT solutions BRAIN-IoT develops new patterns for interaction
    between users and IoT solutions, leveraging semantic mapping of privacy requirements
    towards data and service models in use in each specific use case, introducing
    privacy-related APIs and models. This enables the possibility to programmatically
    inform users about privacy policies in place, as well as enabling them to exercise
    fine-grained privacy controls. TO6: to facilitate rapid model-based development
    and integration of interoperable IoT solutions supporting smart cooperative behaviour
    BRAIN-IoT provides tools to ease rapid prototyping (development, integration)
    of smart cooperative IoT systems. This is achieved by extending available tools
    for development, integration, commissioning and management of IoT and Cyber-Physical
    systems. TO7: to enable commissioning and reconfiguration of decentralized IoT-based
    applications BRAIN-IoT enables end-users to dynamically commission and reconfigure
    their modular IoT instances, choosing among the available platforms, modules implementations
    and services. This is achieved by extending existing open marketplace of IoT services
    and data jointly with available catalogues providing open IoT enablers and integrating
    them with its federation framework. Figure 7.1 The high-level BRAIN-IoT concept.
    7.1.3 Technical Approach The overall BRAIN-IoT concept is depicted in Figure 7.1
    following the reference model proposed by Recommendation ITU-T Y.2060. BRAIN-IoT
    looks at heterogeneous IoT scenarios where instances of IoT architectures can
    be built dynamically combining and federating a distributed set of IoT services,
    IoT platforms and other enabling functionalities made available in marketplaces
    and accessible by means of open and standard IoT APIs and protocols. At the bottom
    of the conceptual architecture, the IoT Devices and Gateways layer represents
    all physical world IoT devices with sensing or actuating capabilities, computing
    devices and includes complex subsystems such as autonomous robots and critical
    control devices. It is worth observing that BRAIN-IoT specifically aims to support
    the integration into an IoT environment of devices and subsystems with actuation
    features that could possible give rise to mixed-criticality situations and require
    the implementation of distributed processing approaches. The BRAIN-IoT Management
    capabilities includes all the features needed to support the envisioned fully
    decentralized scenario dynamically integrating heterogeneous IoT Devices and Gateways
    as well as: IoT Services – third party services accessible through open interfaces
    and offering data or various functionalities including data storage, data statistics
    and analytics, data visualization; IoT Platforms – instances of open IoT platforms
    whose configuration and functionalities can be dynamically updated; IoT Modules
    – enabling functionalities (e.g., smart control features, data processing, data
    storage) that can be associated to a specific IoT platform instance and composed
    in order to meet given functional requirements. Concerning the IoT Modules, the
    ones supporting smart control features are particularly relevant for the BRAIN-IoT
    challenging scenarios encompassing heterogeneous sensors and actuators autonomously
    cooperating in complex, dynamic tasks, possibly across different IoT Platforms.
    BRAIN-IoT will then develop a library of IoT modules implementing algorithms promoting
    collaborative context-based behaviours, control solutions based on Machine Learning
    Control, real-time data analysis and knowledge extraction techniques. Concerning
    the IoT Platforms, BRAIN-IoT will support different existing IoT solutions including
    e.g., FIWARE and SOFIA. All the above IoT building blocks can be described by
    a set of open and extendable vocabularies as well as semantic and behavioural
    models. This actually allows moving forward an easier, automated and dynamic integration
    within the BRAIN-IoT environment of new and existing IoT Services, Platforms and
    Modules available for traditional IoT applications. In fact, BRAIN-IoT defines
    a new meta-language, namely the IoT Modelling Language (IoT-ML), which uses the
    above set of vocabularies and models to formally describe an IoT Instance i.e.,
    how a given set of IoT services and Platforms are interconnected with each other
    and federated and which IoT Modules are associated to the considered IoT Platforms.
    IoT-ML will base on existing solutions provided by OMG and W3C. The Decentralized
    IoT Instances management is instead in charge of offering the capabilities needed
    to support the dynamic composition of a given set of IoT building blocks into
    a specific IoT Instance. The vision is to progress from the fog computing paradigm
    and create distributed IoT Micro-cloud environments hosting IoT Platforms and
    IoT Modules and advertising their runtime capabilities. The resulting Micro-cloud
    environments are enhanced with management capabilities that allow search and discovery
    operations and their dynamic federation to form a specific IoT instance. These
    capabilities pave the way toward highly dynamic scenarios where IoT Modules and
    relevant functionalities can be composed and migrated runtime from one IoT Platform
    to another, complex tasks can be dynamically distributed between the edge and
    the cloud IoT Platforms depending on variable requirements and where IoT Instances
    can be fully reconfigured adding/removing runtime new IoT building blocks from
    the federation. BRAIN-IoT will also provide peculiar management strategies and
    techniques permitting the dynamic deployment/transfer of Smart Control IoT Modules
    across mixed edge and cloud environments. The Decentralized IoT Instances management
    also handles advanced IoT Instances configurations, properly orchestrating external
    IoT services with other IoT building blocks active in the resulting BRAIN-IoT
    fog environment. Finally, monitoring components allow to continuously supervise
    the overall IoT Instance and relevant composite application. In this way, it is
    possible to check the status of the federated building blocks, provide alerting,
    reporting and logging mechanisms and, if needed, trigger an IoT Instance reconfiguration
    e.g., because of a failure in one of the adopted IoT Modules, Platforms or Services.
    All the described management capabilities will base on relevant industry standards
    i.e., W3C Web of Things and OSGi, and will be extended to support agile composition
    and orchestration. The scalability aspects will be taken into careful consideration
    to support effective discovery and search of a potential high number of IoT building
    blocks. The orchestration process is conceived in such a way that it is possible
    to import/link IoT Modules, Platforms and Services made available from a BRAIN-IoT
    Marketplace characterized by a relevant set of open APIs. One of the most peculiar
    aspects being considered in BRAIN-IoT is the management of actuation capabilities
    in the considered Fog environment. In this context, the possibility to easily
    develop the previously introduced smart control features is pretty relevant. To
    this aim, BRAIN-IoT will evolve from already existing solutions, such as Eclipse
    Papyrus, and develop Model Binding and Synthesis tools extended to support the
    BRAIN-IoT open vocabularies and models, the IoT-ML and other IoT related standards.
    The resulting toolset will be used to develop novel Smart Control Features that
    could be possibly published as IoT Modules in the BRAIN-IoT Marketplace, as depicted
    in Figure 7.2. Figure 7.2 BRAIN-IoT development concept. Finally, Figure 7.3.
    summarizes the above description of the BRAIN-IoT environment offering a view
    of possible configurations of an IoT Instance with different distribution of the
    IoT building blocks between edge and cloud. Figure 7.3 BRAIN-IoT deployment concept.
    7.1.4 Security Architecture Concept From the security and privacy perspective,
    IoT currently presents two main inherent weaknesses: Security is not considered
    at the design phase, As of today, no solution is offering a complete end-to-end
    security approach for any kind of devices (from the temperature sensor, the smoke
    detector, to the robot). Existing systems don’t apply the “secure-by-design” concept
    where security is seen as one of the major constraint of the system. To provide
    secure IoT solutions, modelling and analysis need to be integrated in the design
    and validation of application scenarios and IoT architectures. If the focus moves
    to a scenario where different heterogeneous building blocks are dynamically composed,
    additional security and privacy concerns arise. As a consequence, BRAIN-IoT provides
    a methodology to address security in the considered fog environment, based on
    an iterative process, allowing to take into account new scenarios. More specifically,
    BRAIN-IoT extend the successful methods of attack tree modelling and quantitative
    analysis to support secure composable IoT systems. This extension enables transparent
    risk assessment of IoT security architectures, i.e., it will address the needs
    and potential risks involved in an IoT environment specifying when and where to
    apply security controls in an understandable way thus raising user-awareness and
    trustworthiness. The results of the analysis are specific technical requirement
    to implement for each use case/scenario in order to reach the targeted security
    level. Figure 7.4 Iterative risk analysis methodology. Second, existing security
    solution for IoT have many weaknesses, such as: Lot of flow disruption (with network
    component accessing data in clear text) Some protocol chooses to downgrade security
    algorithm to fit performance constraints, State-of-the-art solution are complex
    to set up in decentralized environment. In order to provide a new approach, BRAIN-IoT
    integrates innovative Decentralized Security and Privacy Capabilities including
    Authentication, Authorization and Accounting for the overall distributed fog environment
    and end-to-end security for IoT data-flows. This security layer is based on a
    combination of well-established standards, such as PKI, with more innovative solution,
    stateless oriented, to fit the constraints of any kind of IoT (low power, low
    bandwidth, etc.) Figure 7.5 Decentralised security and privacy capabilities. A
    cross-platforms framework facilitating the adoption of privacy control policies
    is also hosted in the BRAIN-IoT environment. The objective is to provide end users
    with the means to easily monitor and control which data to – collect and to who
    make it available. 7.1.5 Use Cases and Domain Specific Issues The overall depicted
    concept draws requirements and challenging use cases from IoT applications in
    two usage scenarios, namely Service Robotics and Critical Infrastructure Management,
    which provide the suitable setting to reflect future challenges in terms of dependability,
    need for smart behaviour, security and privacy/data ownership management which
    are expected to become more significant and impacting in the long-term (10+years).
    7.1.5.1 Service robotics The Service Robotics use case will involve several robotic
    platforms, like the open-source Robotics Operating System (ROS), which need to
    collaborate to scan a given warehouse and to assist humans in a logistics domain.
    The term Service Robotics is generally related to the use of robots to support
    operations done by humans and the logistics domain is one of the more interesting,
    for the presence of several tasks, where the robots can help the workers, making
    their tasks easier and safer. As example, they can cooperate to move a heavy object
    from one place to another. At the same time, robots involved in the scenario should
    scan the whole warehouse and update in real-time informative interfaces for the
    managers and the workers (e.g. warehouse’s map), sharing the collected information.
    In addition, to the information related to the maps of the whole monitored area,
    the connected robots will also be equipped with a set of sensors, which will allow
    collecting interesting info, like room temperature, presence of humans or presence
    of obstacles in the robot path. Since several robots collaborate to collect the
    information, they can keep the status of the area updated in real-time and balance
    the effort required among them. At the beginning, the robots are configured with
    some default information, like the map of the warehouse. Then, this information
    is updated in real-time, while the robots perform their main tasks. The demonstration
    use-case proposed will include both real-time collection of data and control of
    the included robots. Particularly, the actuation of these robots will be an interesting
    test-bed for the platform, to demonstrate how the solutions developed by BRAIN-IoT
    allow to control remotely, in a standard way, the complex devices involved in
    this scenario. The BRAIN-IoT solution enables the service robotics scenario, demonstrating
    how the tool-chain and marketplace developed by the project can be used to enable
    the cooperation of the different robots. In the envisioned scenario, the BRAIN-IoT
    toolkit will be leveraged to design and test all the aspects of the use case:
    the behaviours of the robots, the interactions with humans and the cooperation
    of involved robots, to do specific tasks. The use of the BRAIN-IoT toolkit will
    enable to limit the development of new ad-hoc software components, indeed, where
    possible, the solution will be based on open-source components and services already
    developed in other IoT platforms, provided to the developers through the BRAIN-IoT’s
    marketplace and interconnected using the services and tools developed in the project.
    This scenario described will involve also several security aspects. Mechanisms
    of encryption and authentication will be adopted in the whole final solution,
    to guarantee the protection of the data exchanged and of the users’ privacy. To
    avoid inappropriate use of the robots by malicious users and to avoid possible
    incidents due to remote control (i.e. authorized workers that try to control the
    robots remotely, without a correct visual of what is happening in the warehouse),
    techniques of indoor localization are considered to guarantee that only workers
    located in specific zones near the robots can control them. Furthermore, the solution
    will protect the privacy of users, anonymizing the data collected, to avoid sharing
    users’ info, also if the data are stolen by malicious users. 7.1.5.2 Critical
    infrastructure management The Critical Water Infrastructure Monitoring and Control
    use case focuses on the management of the water urban cycle in metropolitan environment
    of Coruña. The base of this system will be made of a complex portfolio of probes,
    meters, sensors, devices and open-data sources deployed on the field, including:
    water, flow and pressure meters on the water mains; smart devices, which measure
    the main chemical-physical characteristics of water; pluviometers, which can monitor
    the level of rainwater in a specific zone, water circular pumps, which can be
    used to control the flow of liquids in heating systems. These devices will be
    geographically distributed, heterogeneous and will be provided by different owners:
    directly by the water utility, by end-users themselves or by third-party service
    providers, like, SMEs providing ancillary water services. For this reason, there
    will be many different data involved in these scenarios: meteorological open data,
    reservoir water level data, purification data, distribution data in the various
    subsystems, customer data in urban water supply processes, sewage collection and
    sewage treatment data in different subsystems. The collection of all these data
    will allow to provide value-added services, like showing to the client, commercial
    or not, the quality of the water provided to them or the possibility to react
    quickly to critical situation and to do predictive maintenance, through the ability
    to detect anomalous behaviours and to fix them, before they become an issue difficult
    to be fixed. The BRAIN-IoT solution will enable this scenario, allowing to collect
    data from all the different domains and to actuate the devices where needed. The
    WoT-based approach used for the design of the platform, will be leveraged to collect
    the data, provided by different public and private IoT platforms, using heterogeneous
    protocols and data formats. Furthermore, BRAIN-IoT focuses particularly to design
    and develop ways to control devices abstracted by these solutions. For example,
    the system needs to allow the managers to control the circulator pumps, regulating
    the fluid flow in heating system, to avoid problems or to react to some critical
    situation detected through the monitoring sensors. The collection of the data
    about water consumption from different sources generates risks about privacy protection.
    Indeed, the data can be shared with public entities or third-party services providers
    for several purposes, like statistical measures. To do this, the data need to
    be associated with all the potentially interesting contextual information (i.e.
    Position of the data, timeslot when the data have been measured and so on) but
    removing the association with all the personal info of the entity, related with
    that data. Finally, security mechanisms will be used for the actuation of devices
    that is potentially a dangerous task, which must be executed only by expert personal
    that need to know well what they are doing and the context in which the device
    is operating. For this reason, mechanisms of accounting, authentication and authorization
    will be used to guarantee that only authorized expert users are able to do these
    tricky operations. 7.2 Cognitive Heterogeneous Architecture for Industrial IoT
    – CHARIOT 7.2.1 Introduction Recently, cloud Computing as well as Internet of
    Things (IoT) technologies are rapidly advancing under the concept of future internet.
    Numerous IoT systems and devices are designed and implemented following industrial
    domain requirements but most of the times not considering recent risk relating
    to openness, scalability, interoperability as well as application independence,
    leading to a series of new risks relating to information security and privacy,
    data protection and safety. As a result, securing data, objects, networks, infrastructure,
    systems and people under IoT is expected to have a prominent role in the research
    and standardization activities over the next several years. CHARIOT EC co-funded,
    research project, clearly recognises and replies to this challenge, identifying
    needs and risks and implementing a next generation cognitive IoT platform that
    can enable the creation of intelligent IoT applications with intelligent shielding
    and supervision of privacy, cyber-security and safety threats, as well as complement
    existing IoT systems in non-intrusive ways and yet help guarantee robust security
    by placing devices and hardware as the root of trust. The scope of this article
    is to provide a detailed overview of the CHARIOT vision, technical objectives
    and overall solution, a high-level presentation of the system architecture as
    the project approaches in the design of the CHARIOT solution and platform. 7.2.2
    Business Challenge and Industrial Baselines The CHARIOT project activities are
    aligned with actual business and industrial requirements on the recent needs on
    data safety, security and privacy over modern IoT systems following demands of
    highly increasing numbers of IoT devices. It is expected that by 2025, there will
    be 75 Billion IoT-connected devices World Wide while spending on IoT devices and
    services reached $2 trillion in 2017, with China, North America, and Western Europe
    accounting for 67% of all devices [8]. This growth in connected devices is anticipated
    accelerate due to a rise in adoption of cross-industry devices (LED lighting,
    HVAC systems, physical security systems and lots more). On top of this CHARIOT
    also recognizes various IoT security breaches that have been dominating headlines,
    while 96% of security professionals expect an increase in IoT breaches this year
    [13]. In the direction of a more secure IoT infrastructure, there have been some
    requests for government regulation of the IoT, asserting that IoT manufacturers
    and customers are not paying attention to the security of IoT devices [14]. CHARIOT
    has clearly recognized the above requirements and has an aligned set of objectives
    towards increase of security, privacy and safety of industrial IoT networks and
    components. 7.2.3 The CHARIOT EC, Research Project – Vision and Scope CHARIOT
    (Cognitive Heterogeneous Architecture for Industrial IoT) is an EC, co-funded,
    research project granted under the IoT-03-2017 – R&I on IoT integration and platforms
    as a Research and Innovation (RIA) EC topic. The CHARIOT consortium consists of
    research and innovation organisations from major research streams all merged into
    the CHARIOT solution providing the competence to deliver a ‘holistic approach
    addressing Privacy, Security and Safety of IoT operation in industrial settings
    with safety critical elements’. The consortium includes competences in the fields
    of Project management and IoT governance (INLECOM, UK), Cognitive Architectures
    & Platforms for IoT (IBM, Ireland), Static source code analysis tools (CEA, France),
    Analytics Prediction models and Dashboard development (EBOS, Cyprus) as well as
    IoT deployment architectures, cloud/fog technologies (VTLN, Belgium, TELCOSERV,
    Greece), security including cybersecurity (ISC, ASPISEC, Italy) and integration
    aspects (CLMS, Greece). CHARIOT provides a design method and cognitive computing
    platform supporting a unified approach towards Privacy, Security and Safety (PSS)
    of IoT Systems including the following innovations summarised below: A Privacy
    and security protection method building on state of the art Public Key Infrastructure
    (PKI) technologies to enable the coupling of a pre-programmed private key deployed
    to IoT devices with a corresponding private key on a Blockchain system. This includes
    the implementation of security services utilising a cryptography-based approach
    and IoT security profiles all integrated to the CHARIOT platform. A Blockchain
    ledger in which categories of IoT physical, operational and functional changes
    are both recorded and affirmed/approved by the various run-time engines of the
    CHARIOT ecosystem while leveraging existing blockchain solutions in innovative
    ways. Fog-based decentralised infrastructures for Firmware Security integrity
    checking leveraging Blockchain ledgers to enhance physical, operational and functional
    security of IoT systems, including actuation and deactivation. An accompanying
    IoT Safety Supervision Engine providing a novel solution to the challenges of
    securing IoT data, devices and functionality in new and existing industry-specific
    safety critical systems. A Cognitive System and Method with accompanying supervision,
    analytics and prediction models enabling high security and integrity of Industrials
    IoT. New methods and tools for static code analysis of IoT devices, resulting
    in more efficient secure and safer IoT software development and V&V. CHARIOT is
    closely following a business and industrially driven approach to align the developed
    technologies and outcomes to actual industrial needs in the fields of transport,
    logistics etc and in general domains of IoT applications. With this vision, CHARIOT,
    will apply its outputs and recent developments to three living labs in order to
    demonstrate its realistic and compelling heterogeneous solutions through industry
    reference implementations at representative scale, with the underlying goal of
    demonstrating that Secure, Privacy Mediated and Safety IoT imperatives are collectively
    met, in turn delivering a key stepping stone to the EU’s roadmap for the next
    generation IoT platforms and services. The actual living labs will be implemented
    in the industrial framework of TRENITALIA (rail), Athens International Airport
    (transport) and IBM Ireland (smart buildings) [9, 10]. 7.2.4 CHARIOT Scientific
    and Technical Objectives We present below a summary of the CHARIOT scientific
    and technical objectives as the main scope and outcomes of the CHARIOT unified
    design method and cognitive computing platform supporting a unified approach towards
    Privacy, Security and Safety (PSS) of IoT Systems, that places devices and hardware
    at the root of trust, in turn contributing to high security and integrity of industrial
    IoT. Objective 1: Specify a Methodological Framework for the Design and Operation
    of Secure and Safe IoT Applications addressing System Safety as a cross cutting
    concern. The CHARIOT design method will bridge the systems engineering gaps that
    currently exists between a) the formal safety engineering techniques applied in
    the development and testing of safety critical systems and b) the rapidly evolving
    and ad-hoc manner in IoT devices are developed and deployed. This includes classification
    and usage guidelines of relevant standards and platforms, introduction of new
    concepts and methods for coupling pre-programmed private security keys on the
    IoT device with a Blockchain system and ledger to enhance its security and privacy
    protection and guarantee that only authorised entities who have a matching key
    can influence operation, function and change, thereby invalidating the potential
    for a substantial spectrum of cyber-attacks and significantly before they become
    actual exploits. Developments will also include a specialized static source code
    analysis tool and cross-compiler to help avoid safety defects and add some meta-data
    into the binary permitting that binary executable to be suitably “filtered” or
    “authenticated” by gateways and, in turn, shielding against cyber-attacks while
    consolidate all the above into the CHARIOT IoT Design Method. Objective 2: Develop
    an Open Cognitive IoT Architecture and Platform (the CHARIOT Platform), that exhibits
    intelligent safety behaviour in the diverse and complex ways in which the safety
    critical system and the IoT system will interact in a secure manner. This includes
    the creation of an open IoT Cognitive Architecture for a “Web-of-Things” like
    environment, supporting a range of solutions and applications interacting with
    highly distributed, heterogeneous and dynamic IoT and critical safety system environments.
    Under this objective, CHARIOT will also provide interfacing to a topological representation
    and functional behaviour models of IoT system components and safety profiles as
    well as a integrated IoT Platform by enhancing the existing state of the art in
    cognitive computing platforms and build the additional CHARIOT safety and privacy
    features through open APIs and including security services utilising the Blockchain
    technology, the IoT security profiles and fog computing services. Objective 3:
    Develop a runtime IoT Privacy, Security and Safety Supervision Engine (IPSE) which
    will act continuously to understand and monitor the cyber-physical ecosystem made
    up of the IoT devices, safety critical systems and a PSS policy knowledge-base
    in real-time. This cognitive engine will ensure that potentially endangering behaviours
    of the IoT system are predicted and avoided and, where that is not possible, handled
    in an agreed manner in conjunction with safety critical systems runtime environments
    to avoid a breach of the safety constraints. IPSE will include four innovative
    cognitive applications: A Privacy Engine based on PKI and Blockchain technologies,
    a Firmware Security integrity checking, an IoT Safety Supervision Engine (ISSE)
    and an Analytics Prediction models and Dashboard. Objective 4: Test and validate
    against Industrial IoT safety in three Living Labs (LLs) addressing different
    industrial areas in IoT safety: in transport (rail and airports) and in buildings.
    The LLs will be used to demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed approach
    and provide compelling and representative industry use cases with associated test
    data that will effectively demonstrate an integrated end-to-end application for
    how the broader CHARIOT approach to security, privacy and safety will be applied
    in different industry-representative contexts at enterprise scale. Objective 5:
    Ensure large outcomes scale up through wide dissemination, exploitation actions
    and a Capacity Building Programme aiming at infrastructure sustainability, organisational
    development, and human capital development through training on the practical use
    of the CHARIOT Concepts, Capabilities, Services and Platform Offering. 7.2.5 Technical
    Implementation The technical implementations in CHARIOT will be performed in a
    series of phases, perfectly aligned to the project scientific objectives presented
    above. These include the design, development, integration and testing of several
    key-components as will be presented in the chapters that follow. 7.2.5.1 The CHARIOT
    Open IoT cognitive cloud platform The CHARIOT cognitive platform comprises of
    a set of functions, logical resources and services hosted in a cloud data centre
    supporting a range of cognitive solutions and application interacting with an
    ecosystem of highly distributed, heterogeneous and dynamic IoT and critical safety
    system environments. This module provides connectivity and intelligence, supporting
    actuation and control features as required by the final applications. It takes
    advantage of an existing IoT platform (IBM’s Watson IoT [15]) to demonstrate concept
    and capability and will also support integration with other safety, privacy and
    machine-learning cloud services via relevant open APIs, thus supporting third
    party integration and innovation. Through such interfaces, the CHARIOT platform
    will subsequently be compatible with existing international developments, addressing
    object identity management, fog, discovery services, virtualisation of objects,
    devices and infrastructures and trusted IoT approaches. The CHARIOT platform is
    being designed respecting open principles. While the open nature of the architecture
    does not preclude the adoption of specific vendor technologies in the initial
    platform Proof-of-Concept (PoC) implementation for the living labs, the architecture
    will be intentionally designed with open interfaces such that individual middleware
    and components can be easily substituted with alternatives in future implementations.
    The platform will also explore the development and deployments of probes to provide
    methods of collecting information on the IoT devices and on the safety-critical-systems
    in real-time, in turn facilitating the creation of a topological representation
    and functional behaviours of the IoT systems by the Safety Supervision Engine.
    The cognitive engine will be used to test the concept of adapting autonomously,
    instructing the “system” to behave in intended ways and perform required updates
    and changes through authorised actors. Based on a pattern of events evidenced
    in ledgers, the cognitive system will adapt/instruct the IoT system(s) to adapt
    in appropriate ways based on leveraging innovative machine learning and data mining
    approaches. PKI and Blockchain Technologies Leveraging existing blockchain technologies
    along with traditional PKI schematics enables CHARIOT to revolutionize the field
    of identity management and access control. Blockchain acts as the backbone of
    the system by enabling trust between the various CHARIOT services as well as between
    the gateways and the IoT sensors within the network. The implementation will be
    based on a permissioned blockchain that will become the mediator of any communications
    occurring within the network. 7.2.5.2 Static code analysis and firmware security
    tool A significant component of the CHARIOT overall solution is the development
    and enhancement of a free software cross-compilation toolset – leveraging on existing
    open source technologies – for IoT engineers designing IoT systems and developing
    source code running on them. Strong highly safety-critical IoT software requires
    a costly, but extensive, formal methods approach [11], in which developers agree
    to put a lot of efforts in formally specifying then analysing their source code
    and using proof assistants to ensure lack of bugs (w.r.t. some explicitly, detailed
    and formalized specification). But the CHARIOT project aims to help less life-critical
    IoT software developers by providing them with a tool to help them in developing
    IoT software and better use of existing free software IoT frameworks. This will
    be an open software toolset that assists IoT software developers, particularly
    as not experts in computer science but a competent engineer in a specific industrial
    domain (railroad, automotive, smart building, maritime, etc.), so even heuristic
    source code analysis techniques (leveraging above some formal methods approaches)
    can improve his/her coding productivity. This tool will be developed as part of
    the CHARIOT solution and a plugin/extension module for GCC based compilers that
    the software industry is currently using and will be executed at compilation/linking
    stage and will use meta-programming techniques to foster “declarative” high-level
    programming styles. This will enable the developers (as the IoT device firmware
    developers) to identify most safety critical functions executed at the IoT device
    or gateway level. Also, firmware compiled with that toolset will carry some cryptographic
    signature to enable filtering of firmware updates in the gateway. 7.2.5.3 Integrated
    IoT privacy, security and safety supervision engine This engine is a set of novel
    runtime components which act in concert to understand and monitor the cyber-physical
    ecosystem made up of the IoT gateway and devices, the safety critical systems
    and safety/security policy knowledge-base. The Privacy Engine utilises existing
    security protocols and technologies such as Blockchain to provide a strong foundation
    for the trusted interchange of information about and between the participants
    in the system-of-systems. The Safety Engine also analyses the IoT topology and
    signal metadata relative to the relevant safety profiles and applies closed-loop
    machine-learning techniques to detect safety violations and alert conditions.
    The objective of this engines is to develop a cognitive engine that will leverage
    the Cyber-Physical topological representation of the system-of-systems combined
    with the security/safety-polices to provide a real-time risk map will allow for
    both static analysis and continuous monitoring to assess safety impact and appropriate
    response actions. The supervision engine will be responsible for interacting with
    the CHARIOT IoT platform, providing the centralised intelligence and control functionality
    for applying the necessary privacy, security, and safety policies to all components
    in the IoT system of systems, monitor IoT devices and systems to detect abnormalities
    in their behaviour and analyse their causes, maintain an internal topological
    representation of the constantly evolving IoT system of systems and collect and
    represent PSS policies and the threat intelligence in the topology to provide
    a real-time risk map, impact assessment and triggering of appropriate response
    actions. The engine will also maintain safety, security and privacy even when
    unknown devices and sensors are connected to the network, ensuring that they do
    not interfere to the normal operation of existing IoT components, assess the topology
    to detect whether the IoT ecosystem has entered or is predicted to be advancing
    towards an abnormal (unsafe/insecure) state, and automatically activate a safety
    remediation in response to this unsafe state, to reduce the impacts on users and
    other IoT components and restrict abnormal operations and allow operations of
    safe functions to maintain at reduced level the operation of the controlled system.
    7.2.5.4 Analytics prediction models user interface This system component is an
    innovative cognitive web application, which constitutes together with other relevant
    components – such as the Privacy and the IoT Safety Supervision Engine – the IPSE.
    The application collects the data received by the various IoT gateways and sensors
    in the fog network and using appropriate algorithms, Analytics Prediction models
    will be created and presented through a user friendly configurable dashboard.
    This module will be the advanced-intelligence dashboard for both understanding
    of the IoT ecosystem topology and for post data analytical purposes to assist
    in the refinement and improvements of PSS policies while at the same time act
    as the interface between the CHARIOT platform and the system operator/user. 7.2.6
    System Demonstration, Validation and Benchmarking The overall system operation
    will be demonstrated and validated via full integration to the actual operating
    environments and infrastructures of three industrial sites over precise key-performance-indicators
    that contribute to the separate business environment and value. The three key
    selected sites (living labs, LLs) will be: a) Trenitalia (transport – rail) b)
    IBM Ireland business campus (smart buildings) and c) Athens international airport
    (transport – airport). Details on the three separate cases have been included
    below: 7.2.6.1 Living lab 1: Trenitalia The primary objective in this LL is to
    enhance the safe operation of the Italian railways service. This includes, reduction
    of risk to passengers and personnel, compliance with appropriate regulations,
    and creation of a safe and efficient operating environment in the railways. At
    the same time this use case will focus on utilizing the feed from IoT used to
    monitor electrical and mechanical components dedicated on assessing energy consumption
    and dispatch them to the on-board control servers and the land-based central control
    system. The application of the CHARIOT tool will facilitate the timely recognition
    of sensors malfunction, along with prediction of maintenance requirements. 7.2.6.2
    Living lab 2: IBM business campus In this LL, the objective will be to enable
    the continued IoT evolution of the IBM technology campus from a set of individuals
    “automated/smart” buildings into to a truly cognitive IoT environment that provides
    a safer and more efficiently managed working environment for all IBM staff, customers
    and visitors and also to use the knowledge gained to help drive advancements in
    Cognitive IoT to a global scale by reflecting it in IBM products and services.
    7.2.6.3 Living lab 3: Athens international airport The application of CHARIOT
    in this Living Lab will address safety of airport Infrastructures, enhance protection
    of Athens airport’s facilities from physical and cyber threats. To achieve this,
    CHARIOT will enhance airports capability on early detection/prediction of hazardous
    situations, in parallel with reduction in false positive alarms that disrupt airport
    operations. 7.2.7 Summary and Discussion This chapter provides the overall concept
    of the CHARIOT project and business orientation. It summarizes the project scope
    and business value as derived from actual industrial needs in the framework of
    safety, security and privacy of industrial IoT. CHARIOT started in January 2018
    and it currently in the stage of requirements extraction and definition of the
    system overall architecture as this is aligned with the project end-users (living
    labs) that drive and validate the technological developments. Currently, CHARIOT
    is also defining the technical and methodological framework of the overall solution
    adapted for the cases of the three living labs that is going to evolve into the
    concise implementations for the next project phases, in a systematic approach
    to Privacy, Security, and Safety in Industrial IoT environments, using a strategic/objectives
    driven systematic way, in a process of continuous improvement. CHARIOT intends
    to have a first implementation of the system within the first months of 2019 and
    will integrate this to all infrastructures involved and as planned. This project
    has received funding from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation
    programme under grant agreement No 780075”. The authors acknowledge the research
    outcomes of this publication belonging to the CHARIOT consortium. 7.3 ENACT: Development,
    Operation, and Quality Assurance of Trustworthy Smart IoT Systems Until now, IoT
    system innovations have been mainly concerned with sensors, device management
    and connectivity, with the mission to gather data for processing and analysis
    in the cloud in order to aggregate information and knowledge [16]. This approach
    has conveyed significant added value in many application domains, however, it
    does not unleash the full potential of the IoT [82]. The next generation IoT systems
    need to perform distributed processing and coordinated behaviour across IoT, edge
    and cloud infrastructures [17], manage the closed loop from sensing to actuation,
    and cope with vast heterogeneity, scalability and dynamicity of IoT systems and
    their environments. Moreover, the function and correctness of such systems has
    a range of criticality from business critical to safety critical. Thus, aspects
    related to trustworthiness such as security, privacy, resilience and robustness,
    are challenging aspects of paramount importance [16]. Therefore, the next generation
    of IoT systems must be trustworthy above all else. In ENACT, we will call them
    trustworthy smart IoT systems, or for short; trustworthy SIS. Developing and managing
    the next generation trustworthy SIS to operate in the midst of the unpredictable
    physical world represents daunting challenges. Challenges, for example, that include
    that such systems always work within safe operational boundaries [18] by controlling
    the impact that actuators have on the physical world and managing conflicting
    actuation requests. Moreover, the ability of these systems to continuously evolve
    and adapt to their changing environments are essential to ensure and increase
    their trustworthiness, quality and user experience. DevOps is a philosophy and
    practices that covers all the steps from concept to delivery of a software product.
    In ENACT we see DevOps advocating a set of software engineering best practices
    and tools, to ensure Quality of Service while continuously evolving complex systems,
    foster agility, rapid innovation cycles, and ease of use [19]. DevOps has been
    widely adopted in the software industry. However, there is no systematic DevOps
    support for trustworthy smart IoT systems today [18–20]. The aim of ENACT is to
    enable DevOps in the domain of trustworthy smart IoT systems. 7.3.1 Challenges
    The key research question of ENACT is thus the following: “how we can tame the
    complexity of developing and operating smart IoT systems, which (i) involve sensors
    and actuators and (ii) need to be trustworthy?”. Our fundamental approach is to
    evolve DevOps methods and techniques as baseline to address this issue. We thus
    refine the research question as follows: “how we can apply and evolve the DevOps
    tools and methods to facilitate the development and operation of trustworthy smart
    IoT applications?”. Challenge 1: Support continuous delivery of trustworthy SIS.
    Currently there is little effort spent on providing solutions for the delivery
    and deployment of application across the whole IoT, edge and cloud space. In particular,
    there is a lack of languages and abstractions that can be used to support the
    orchestration of software services and their continuous deployment on heterogeneous
    devices [21] together with the relevant security mechanisms and policies. Challenge
    2: Support the agile operation of trustworthy SIS. The operation of large-scale
    and highly distributed IoT systems can easily overwhelm traditional operation
    teams. Other management models such as NoOps and Serverless Computing are evolving
    to solve this problem. Whatever the operations management model the major challenges
    will be to improve efficiency and the collaboration with development teams for
    rapid and agile evolution of the systems. Currently, there is a lack of mechanisms
    dedicated to smart IoT systems able to (i) monitor their status, (ii) indicate
    when their behaviour is not as expected, (iii) identify the origin of the problem,
    and (iv) automate typical operation activities. Furthermore, the impossibility
    of anticipating all the adaptations a system may face when operating in an open
    context, creates an urgent need for mechanisms that will automatically maintain
    the adaptation rules of a SIS. Challenge 3: Support continuous quality assurance
    strengthening trustworthiness of SIS. Maintaining quality of service is a complex
    task that needs to be considered throughout the whole life-cycle of a system.
    This complexity is increased in the smart IoT system context where it is not feasible
    for developers and operators to exhaustively explore, anticipate or resolve all
    possible context situations that a system may encounter during its operation.
    This is due to the open context in which these systems operate and as a result
    can hinder their trustworthiness. Quality of Service is particularly important
    when the system can have an impact on the physical world through actuators. In
    addition, testing, security assurance as well as the robustness of such systems
    is challenging [20]. 7.3.2 The ENACT Approach DevOps seeks to decrease the gap
    between a product design and its operation by introducing software design and
    development practices and approaches to the operation domain and vice versa. In
    the core of DevOps there are continuous processes and automation supported by
    different tools at various stages of the product life-cycle. In particular, the
    ENACT DevOps Framework will meet the challenges below and support the DevOps practices
    during the development and operation of trustworthy smart IoT systems. ENACT will
    provide innovations and enablers that will feature trustworthy IoT systems built
    by implementing the seven stages of the process as depicted in Figure 7.6. Plan:
    The ENACT approach is to introduce a new enabler to support the risk-driven and
    context-aware planning of IoT systems development, including mechanisms to facilitate
    the selection of the most relevant and trustworthy devices and services to be
    used in future stages. Figure 7.6 ENACT support of DevOps for trustworthy smart
    IoT systems. Code: The ENACT approach is to leverage the model-driven engineering
    approach and in particular to evolve recent advances of the ThingML [21] language
    and generators to support modelling of system behaviours and automatic derivation
    across vastly heterogeneous and distributed devices both at the IoT and edge layers.
    Build and Deploy: The ENACT approach is to provide a new deployment modelling
    language to specify trustworthy and secure orchestrations of sensors, actuators
    and software components, along with the mechanisms to identify and handle potential
    actuation conflicts at the model level. The deployment engine will automatically
    collect the required software components and integrate the evolution of the system
    into the run-time environment across the whole IoT, Edge and Cloud space. Test:
    ENACT enablers will allow continuous testing of smart IoT systems in an environment
    capable of emulating and simulating IoT and edge infrastructure by targeting the
    constraints related to the distribution and infrastructure of IoT systems. This
    system is intended to be able to simulate some basic attacks or security threats.
    Operate: The ENACT approach will provide enablers for the automatic adaptation
    of IoT systems based on their run-time context, reinforced by online learning.
    Such automatic adaptation will address the issue of the management complexity.
    The complexity of open-context IoT systems can easily exceed the capacity of human
    operation teams. Automatic adaptation will improve the trustworthiness of the
    smart IoT system execution. Monitor: The ENACT approach is to deliver innovative
    mechanisms to observe the: status, behaviour, and security level of the running
    IoT systems. Robust root cause analysis mechanisms will also be provided. In addition
    to the DevOps related contributions identified above, the ENACT DevOps Framework
    will provide specific cross-cutting innovations related to trustworthiness, which
    can be seamlessly applied, in particular based on the following ENACT concepts:
    Resilience and robustness: The ENACT approach is to provide novel solutions to
    make the smart IoT systems resilient by providing enablers for diversifying IoT
    service implementations, and deployment topologies (e.g., implying that instances
    of a service can have a different implementation and operate differently, still
    ensuring consistent and predictable global behaviour). This will lower the risk
    of privacy and security breaches and significantly reduced impact in case of cyber-attack
    infringements. Security, privacy and identity management: The ENACT approach is
    to provide support to ensure the security of trustworthy SIS. This not only includes
    smart preventive security mechanisms but also the continuous monitoring of security
    metrics and the context with the objective to trigger reactive security measures.
    7.3.3 ENACT Case Studies Three use cases from the Intelligent Transport Systems
    (Rail), eHealth and Smart Building application domains will guide, validate and
    demonstrate the ENACT research. 7.3.3.1 Intelligent transport systems This use
    case will assess the feasibility of IoT services in the domain of train integrity
    control, in particular for the logistics and maintenance of the rolling stock
    and on-track equipment. In this domain, the infrastructure and the resources that
    should be used are usually expensive and require a long-time in planning and execution.
    Therefore, the usage of the rail systems must be optimised at maximum, following
    security and safety directives due to the critical and strategic characteristics
    of the domain. This use case will involve logistic and maintenance activities.
    Within the ENACT scope, it will be focused on the logistics activities. A logistic
    and maintenance scenario will be defined with the aim to provide information about
    the wagons that form the rolling stock. This scenario will cover not only optimizing
    cargo storing and classification, but also providing the appropriate resources
    to assure the correct functioning of the system. These will be only possible if
    the train integrity is confirmed when the different wagons are locked and moving
    together. This situation will assure the proper transportation of cargo or passengers,
    avoiding possible accidents. This use case will involve an infrastructure consisting
    of large sets of on-board sensors (e.g., Integrity Detector, Asset data info,
    Humidity and temperature sensors) and multiple gateways interacting with cloud
    resources. 7.3.3.2 eHealth The eHealth use case will develop a digital health
    system for supporting and helping various patients staying at home to the maximum
    extent possible either during treatment or care. Elderly people are one type of
    subject in this case study. The Digital health system will feature elderly care
    to allow the subjects to live at home as long as possible. Another type of patients
    that we consider is Diabetes patients that need to follow their glucose level
    and regularly be followed up by health personnel. The digital health system will
    both control equipment normally present in smart homes to make life comfortable
    (automatic light control, door locks, heater control, etc.), and control various
    types of medical devices and sensors. These devices and sensors support the care
    and wellness for the specific patient and consist of a wide variety of types,
    including: blood pressure meter, scales, fall detection sensors, glucose meter,
    video surveillance, medicine reminder, indoor and out-door location etc). In addition,
    the system needs to integrate with other systems to provide information or alarms
    for example to response centres, care-givers, physicians, next of kin etc., and
    to feed information to medical systems such as electronic patient journals (EPJ).
    The pivotal role of the system’s Edge Computing will be what we denote “the medical
    gateway” which integrates sensors and devices, controls the edge and ensures the
    right data are provided to the various stakeholders and to integrated systems
    such as EPJ. 7.3.3.3 Smart building This use case will make use of smart building
    sensors, actuators and services. To this aim two sets of applications covering
    Smart Energy Efficiency and Smart Elderly Care will be developed within a Care
    Centre environment. Energy efficiency of new and existing buildings is crucial
    to achieve carbon emission reduction, and as we increasingly spend more time indoors,
    adequate levels of user comfort need to be guaranteed by the smart buildings.
    This implies a trade-off between energy use and the different aspects of users’
    comfort. They will be tested in the KUBIK, a smart building especially designed
    for testing new solutions for sustainable buildings. The use case will simulate
    a care centre consisting of small apartments where a group of elderly people live
    together. This care centre use case includes sensors and actuators that monitor
    and control the environment in order to ensure the safety of the facilities, to
    perform energy efficiency measures and also to support the care-takers in monitoring
    the wellbeing of users. The trend for smart buildings is to provide an increasing
    range of services supported by an increasing number of IoT sensors and actuators.
    Example of such services or applications include thermal comfort, visual comfort,
    energy efficiency, security, etc. Applications in this space need to share building
    infrastructure and may have conflicting objectives. The solution requires a clear
    hierarchy between the different actuation scenarios. 7.4 Search Engines for Browsing
    the Internet of Things – IoTCrawler Efficient and secure access to Big IoT Data
    will be a pivotal factor for the prosperity of European industry and society.
    However, today data and service discovery, search, and access methods and solutions
    for the IoT are in their infancy, like Web search in its early days. IoT search
    is different from Web search because of dynamicity and pervasiveness of the resources
    in the network. Current methods are more suited for fewer (hundreds to millions),
    static or stored data and services resources. There is yet no adaptable and dynamic
    solution for effective integration of distributed and heterogeneous IoT contents
    and support of data reuse in compliance with security and privacy needs, thereby
    enabling a true digital single market. Previous reports show that a large part
    of the developers’ time is spent on integration. In general, the following issues
    limit the adoption of dynamic IoT-based applications: The heterogeneity of various
    data sources hinders the uptake of innovative cross-domain applications. The large
    amount of raw data without intrinsic explanation remains meaningless in the context
    of other application domains. Missing security and neglected privacy present the
    major concern in most domains and are a challenge for constrained IoT resources.
    The large-scale, distributed and dynamic nature of IoT resources requires new
    methods for crawling, discovery, indexing, physical location identification and
    ranking. IoT applications require new search engines, such as bots that automatically
    initiate search based on user’s context. This requires machine intelligence. The
    complexity involved in discovery, search, and access methods makes the development
    of new IoT enabled applications a complex task. Some ongoing efforts, such as
    Shodan and Thingful provide search solutions for IoT. However, they rely mainly
    on a centralised indexing and manually provided metadata. Moreover, they are rather
    static and neglect privacy and security issues. To enable the use of IoT data
    and to exploit the business potential of IoT applications, an effective approach
    needs to provide: An adaptive distributed framework enabling abstraction from
    heterogeneous data sources and dynamic integration of volatile IoT resources.
    Security, privacy and trust by design as integral part of all the processes from
    publication, indexing, discovery, and subscription to higher-level application
    access. Scalable methods for crawling, discovery, indexing and ranking of IoT
    resources in large-scale cross-platform and cross-disciplinary systems and scenarios.
    Machine initiated semantic search to enable automated context dependent access
    to IoT resources. Monitoring and analysing the Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality
    of Information (QoI) to support fault recovery and service continuity in IoT environments.
    IoTCrawler is an EU H2020 project that addresses the above challenges by proposing
    efficient and scalable methods for crawling, discovery, indexing and ranking of
    IoT resources in large-scale cross-platform and cross-disciplinary systems and
    scenarios. It develops enablers for secure and privacy-aware discovery and access
    to the resources, and monitors and analyses QoS and QoI to rank suitable resources
    and to support fault recovery and service continuity. The project evaluates the
    developed methods and tools in various use-cases, such as Smart City, Social IoT,
    Smart Energy and Industry 4.0. The key elements of IoTCrawler are shown in Figure
    7.7. Figure 7.7 Key concepts of the IoTCrawler proposal. [40] 018 IEEE. The project
    aims to create scalable and flexible IoT resource discovery by using meta-data
    and resource descriptions in a dynamic data model. This means, for example, that
    if a user is interested in measuring temperature in a certain location, the result
    (e.g. list of sensors) should only contain sensors that can measure temperature,
    but the user may accept sensors that closely fulfil her/his application requirements
    even though all other characteristics may not be favourable (e.g. cost of acquisition
    may be high and sensor response time may be slow). For this reason, the system
    should understand the user priorities, which are often machine-initiated queries
    and search requests, and provide the results accordingly by using adaptive and
    dynamic techniques. 7.4.1 Architecture of IoTCrawler IoTCrawler provides novel
    approaches to support an IoT framework of interoperable systems including security
    and privacy-aware mechanisms, and offers new methods for discovery, crawling,
    indexing and search of dynamic IoT resources. It supports and enable machine-initiated
    knowledge-based search in the IoT world. Figure 7.8 depicts the IoTCrawler framework
    and highlights its key components, which are detailed next. 7.4.1.1 IoT framework
    of interoperable (distributed) systems The diversity of the market has resulted
    in a variety of sophisticated IoT platforms that will continue to exist. However,
    to evolve and enable the full benefits of IoT, these platforms need access to
    data, information and services across various IoT networks and systems within
    an integrated ecosystem of IoT resources. IoTCrawler envisions a cooperation of
    platforms and systems to provide smart integrated IoT based services. Nevertheless,
    instead of defining an overarching hyper-platform on top, the integration proposed
    by IoTCrawler is carried out by the definition of a common interface, enabling
    this way cooperation and interconnection of various platforms by making their
    data and services discoverable and accessible to other applications and services.
    An IoTCrawler-enabled platform can internally be implemented in different ways,
    since it only has to support the common and open interfaces to join the ecosystem.
    The open IoT interfaces are split in two planes that are called control and data
    planes. The control plane will coordinate and control the data and information
    processing in the platforms (monitoring and quality analysis). The data plane
    will allow for IoT data flow exchange between platforms (crawling, indexing and
    search). Figure 7.8 Overall architecture of the IoTCrawler framework. [40] 2018
    IEEE. 7.4.1.2 Holistic security, privacy and trust An ecosystem of IoT platforms
    brings immense benefits but also potential risks for users and stakeholders. The
    very principle that makes the IoT so powerful – the potential to share data instantly
    with everyone and everything – creates huge security and privacy risks. Since
    IoT systems are, by their nature, distributed and operate often in unprotected
    environments, the maintenance of security, privacy, and trust is a challenging
    task. IoTCrawler addresses quality, privacy, trust and security issues by employing
    a holistic and end-to-end approach to the data and service publication to search
    and access workflow. Device and connectivity management will ensure that the end
    devices only connect to trusted access networks. IoTCrawler develops solutions
    for mitigating privacy intrusion and data correlation based on data collected
    from multiple sources. Both technical and information governance procedures and
    guidelines are defined and implemented. This makes sure that the technical solutions
    are in place for avoiding the security and privacy risks, and also appropriate
    information governance procedures and best practices and measures are followed
    in development, deployment and utilisation of the use-cases and third-party applications.
    7.4.1.3 Crawling, discovery and indexing of dynamic IoT resources Information
    access and retrieval on the early days of the Internet and the Web mainly relied
    on simple functions and methods. For example, Yahoo’s first search engine was
    simply based on the “grep” function in Unix or the AltaVista search engine initially
    did not have a ranking mechanism. The Internet and the Web have gone a long way
    in the past two decades to improve the way we access the information on the Web.
    While the current information and search retrieval on the Web is far from ideal,
    there are several sophisticated methods and solutions that provide crawling, indexing,
    ranking and search and retrieval of extremely large volumes of information on
    the Internet. The new generations of Web search engines have now focused on information
    extraction, personalised and customised knowledge and extraction techniques and
    solutions. Some early works are demonstrated by Google’s knowledge graph, Wolfram
    Alpha and Microsoft Bing. The current information access and retrieval methods
    on the IoT are still at the same stage that the Web and the Internet were in their
    early days. Information retrieval on the large-scale IoT systems is currently
    based on the assumption that the sources are known to the devices and consumers
    or it is assumed that opportunistic methods will send discovery and negotiation
    messages to find and interact with other relevant resources in their outreach
    (e.g. Google’s recent Physical Web project is designed based on this assumption).
    Overall, IoT systems have more ad-hoc resources that do not comply with document
    and URL processing and indexing norms; the resources, such as mobile phones and
    sensing devices, can publish data and then move to another location or disappear.
    Service and data crawling and discovery for smart connected devices and services
    will also involve automated associations and integration to provide an extensible
    framework for information access and retrieval in IoT. IoTCrawler focuses on providing
    reliable, quality and resource-aware and scalable mechanisms for data and services
    publishing, crawling, indexing in very large-scale distributed dynamic IoT environments.
    7.4.1.4 Machine-Initiated semantic search In the past, search engines were mainly
    used by human users to search for content and information. In the newly emerging
    search model, information is provided depending on the users’ (human user or a
    machine) context and requirements (for example, location, time, activity, previous
    records, and profile). The information access can be initiated without the user’s
    explicit query or instruction but used on its necessity and relevance (context-aware
    search). This will require machine interpretable search results in semantic forms.
    Moreover, social media, physical sensors (numerical streaming values), and Web
    documents must be better integrated, and the search results should become more
    machine interpretable information rather than remaining as pure links (e.g. the
    Web search engines mainly return a list of links to the pages as their results;
    with some exceptions on popular questions and topics). IoTCrawler enables context-aware
    search and automated processing of data by semantic annotation of the data streams,
    thus making their characteristics and capabilities available in a machine processable
    way. There are several existing works that provide methods and techniques for
    semantic annotations and description of the IoT devices, services and their messages
    and data. However, most of these methods rely on centralised solutions and complex
    query mechanisms that hinder their scalability and wide scale deployment and use
    for the IoT. IoTCrawler supports an ecosystem of multiple platforms and develops
    dynamic semantic annotation and reasoning methods that will allow continuous and
    seamless integration of new devices and services by exploiting and adapting existing
    annotations based on similarity measures. The automatic discovery has to consider
    the current context. Context-awareness requires the integration and analysis of
    social, physical and cyber data. IoTCrawler develops enablers for context-aware
    IoT search. Hence the requirements of the different applications are mapped to
    the solutions by selecting resources considering parameters such as security and
    privacy level, quality, latency, availability, reliability and continuity. IoTCrawler
    improves reliability and robustness by fault recovery mechanisms and mitigation
    of malfunctioning devices using device activation/deactivation in the associated
    area. The fault recovery also requires mechanisms to support communication among
    networked IoT resources located in diverse locations and across different platforms,
    and to provide secure and efficient re-distribution of information in case of
    failure. 7.4.2 Use Cases IoTCrawler is currently evaluating its technologies in
    four real world use-cases: Smart Cities, Social IoT, Smart Energy, and Industry
    4.0 (see Figure 7.9). Further use-cases will be identified and ranked in co-creation
    workshops with the relevant stakeholders within the project. Figure 7.9 IoTCrawler
    use cases at a glance. 7.4.2.1 Smart city The city of Aarhus has been considered
    as a target for smart city deployment in the project. IoTCrawler helps to overcome
    the negative perceptions of Internet of Things and Smart Cities by developing
    smart city experimentation tools for Aarhus’ City Lab that can make citizens and
    companies engaged and be curious about smart city solutions. IoTCrawler also provides
    the enabling technologies to discover new data sources in Aarhus for Open Data
    platforms and has the potential to become a reference platform supporting IoT
    data and service sharing as part of the sharing economy. To track the performance
    of a smart city, IoTCrawler develops enablers for monitoring activity and quality
    of the sensors. This can be used to set up KPI’s for City Labs and to track its
    performance. The smart city deployment of Murcia is also considered in IoTCrawler,
    exploiting the large sensor platform installed. 7.4.2.2 Social IoT Social IoT
    relates to using sensors deployed at sports and entertainment events in order
    to quantify the performance of professionals or experience of participants. This
    enables participants to engage in events beyond simply watching, thus creating
    a unique personal record of their experience, and in combination with social and
    digital media allows event manager to create new insights and content for their
    audience. IoTCrawler has access to over 800 events, including fashion events (e.g.
    New York Fashion week), culinary events, sports events (e.g. Basketball Final
    Four), or events such as Miss Universe. For each event, sensors are deployed at
    local venues and participants and spectators are equipped with wearable devices.
    This results in a range of diverse data sets that are collected, analysed, stored,
    and used, e.g. for content creation. Discovering and semi-automatically describing
    existing sensors, data sets and streams using IoTCrawler technologies has the
    potential to significantly increase the overall value of the dataset access and
    their integration, making it accessible to a larger group of people and enabling
    new applications. As described above, the data sets include raw sensor data and
    processed analytic results. However, data processing often involves data from
    other third-party sources. For this reason, play-by-play data is used to correlate
    analytical results to match events, and social media sources can be used to link
    to user generated content. IoTCrawler’s discovery, indexing and search enablers
    have the potential to significantly reduce the effort associated with the integration
    of sensor technologies, and other external data sources. 7.4.2.3 Smart energy
    Smart Buildings play an important role in distributed energy systems as they turn
    from energy consumers to the so-called “energy prosumers”. In future energy systems,
    Smart Buildings actively interact with the Smart Grids in order to stabilise them
    or participate in energy trading as well as for structural condition monitoring
    and proactive maintenance. For this purpose, buildings offer semantically annotated
    properties of the technical equipment within especial energy flexibilities (i.e.
    for shifting electrical and thermal loads). In this frame, this use-case employs
    the technologies developed in IoTCrawler to dynamically discover the flexibilities
    of Smart Buildings and analyse their potential as well as their demand for applications
    that are necessary to manage and offer energy to the Smart Grid or the energy
    market. This information can be used by energy retailers or grid operators to
    deploy best fitting applications to individual buildings. The project uses semantic
    enrichment of grid data and data analytics to enhance smart grid applications
    and reduce the need for manual engineering and setup of systems. 7.4.2.4 Industry
    4.0 Industry 4.0 includes advances such as predictive maintenance, energy prediction,
    or human-robot collaboration. The results of IoTCrawler will be used to improve
    predictive maintenance planning for horizontal machining centres in aerospace
    and Die&Mould industries. Currently, data integration consumes more than 80% of
    the time in the industry. IoTCrawler has the potential to significantly accelerate
    the development and deployment of Industry 4.0 analytics solutions, by discovering
    and semi-automatically integrating machine metadata, sensor data provided by the
    machines and information stored in related enterprise databases. Extending the
    discovery to actuator services (e.g. air conditioning, heating, and machine operation)
    allows to link actions for avoiding load peaks to energy analytics pipeline. IoTCrawler
    also increases workers’ safety by identifying critical conditions (e.g. gas exposition)
    in the permanent sensor data stream of drones, and forward such condition markers
    to monitoring teams and production management subsystems. 7.4.3 Main Innovations
    in the Areas of Research The literature within key areas of the IoTCrawler proposal
    is reviewed next, indicating the main innovations of the work within the general
    framework described above. 7.4.3.1 Search and discovery Being essential for any
    network architecture, one of the key components of the proposed architecture is
    the search and discovery operation. Distributed Hash Table (DHT) is used to provide
    a high scalability in storage and a flexible support for query and update operations.
    DHT is a totally decentralised system that stores data objects for easy and quick
    access (query) and update (store). DHTs are built on top of overlay networks into
    which network objects are spread and identified with unique keys, e.g. the well-studied
    overlay network and DHT Chord mechanism [22], which is the direct ancestor of
    Kademlina [23] (BitTorrent’s DHT). Overlay networks and DHTs are well suited to
    form the basement of a proper discovery mechanism, such as the Overlay Management
    Backbone (OMB) approach [24]. To add suitable schema evolution to the information/content
    discovery, description mechanisms such as the Resource Description Framework (RDF)
    and JSON-LD [25] are needed. Combining a DHT mechanism with RDF, the work in [26]
    proposes to use an adapted version of RDQL [27] to perform the queries. The main
    problems of this approach are that it consumes a lot of storage space and that
    it is not efficient for simple searches. SPARQL [28] is the de facto query language
    for RDF, by providing a coherent and simple search mechanism. The IoTCrawler approach
    exploits the remarkable qualities of the overlay network and DHT described above
    to build a distributed discovery infrastructure. However, the nodes are deployed
    in separate domains to distribute both the storage/finding load and the management
    of information access. 7.4.3.2 Security for IoT In spite of the emergence of different
    cross-world initiatives in recent years (IERC, ITU-T SG20, IEEE IoT Initiative4
    or IPSO Alliance are just some of them), there is a lack of a unified vision on
    security and privacy considerations in the IoT paradigm, which embraces the whole
    lifecycle of smart objects that are making up the digital landscape of the future.
    In the IoT, data confidentiality and authentication, access control within the
    networks, privacy and trust among users and things are among some of the key issues
    [29]. IoTCrawler explores the use of advanced cryptographic techniques based on
    Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE). Specifically, it analyses the application and
    extension of the Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (CP-ABE) as a flexible
    and promising cryptographic scheme in order to enable information to be shared
    while confidentiality is still preserved. In CP-ABE, the cipher-text embeds the
    access structure to describe which private-keys can decrypt it, and the same private-key
    is labelled with descriptive attributes. IoTCrawler addresses the integration
    of CP-ABE with different signatures schemes to provide end-to-end integrity to
    the information that is shared for anticipatory purposes. Users are given means
    to define how their personal information is shared and under which circumstances
    using a policy-based approach. Additionally, IoTCrawler investigates the integration
    of this solution within the search and discovery process for IoT. The Blockchain
    paradigm [30] is also included in IoTCrawler. A Blockchain is a distributed database
    that maintains a continuously growing set of transactions in a way that is designed
    to be secure, transparent, highly resistant to outages, auditable, and efficient,
    at the same time it is distributed. However, despite the benefits that Blockchain
    technologies offer, we still need to overcome two major challenges in IoTCrawler.
    First, privacy, since transactions tend to be public, and encryption to protect
    transactions’ contents is not enough because it still allows the remaining nodes
    in the system to learn about the occurrence of a particular exchange in the system;
    and, second, scalability, because existing permission-less blockchains (e.g. Bitcoin)
    are only able to scale to a considerable number of nodes at the expense of attained
    throughput, e.g. Bitcoin’s throughput is about seven transactions per second.
    Moreover, IoTCrawler will leverage Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to enhance
    the security primitives deployed in the proposed framework, given that existing
    TEEs suffer from a number of shortcomings, especially with respect to their security
    and privacy provisions. In the area of Authentication, Authorisation and Accounting
    (AAA), IoTCrawler proposes a lightweight access control scheme based on Capability
    Tokens for IoT as presented in [31, 32], where these tokens act as a proof of
    possession providing a straightforward validation mechanism without requesting
    a third party. We propose a mechanism for interoperability of different authentication
    and authorisation solutions based on a bridge to third party elements, such as
    the standard stacks as LDAP and FIWARE Service Enablers to support a lightweight
    federation-like approach. 7.4.3.3 Data validation and quality analysis The assessment
    of Quality of Data can basically be evaluated in five common dimensions: Completeness,
    Correctness, Concordance, Plausibility and Currency. In [33] the authors provide
    a table of different terms used to describe one of the dimensions of data quality.
    Furthermore, they provide a mapping between data quality dimensions and data quality
    assessment methods. In [34] Sieve is introduced, a framework to flexibly express
    quality assessment methods and fusion methods. The STAR-CITY project [35] describes
    a system for semantic traffic analytics. Based on various heterogeneous data sources
    (e.g., Dublin bus activity, events in Dublin city), their system is able to predict
    future traffic conditions with the goal to make traffic management easier and
    to support urban planning. One of the major challenges in the assessment of quality
    metrics to sensory IoT data is the lack of ground truth. The authors of [36] and
    [37] developed and evaluated a concept for the assessment of node trustworthiness
    in a network based on data plausibility checks. They propose that every node performs
    a plausibility check to identify malicious nodes sending faulty data. Similar
    to this work, they use data sources in order to find “witnesses” for a given sensor
    reading. The authors in [38] propose three different approaches to deal with a
    missing ground truth in social media: spatiotemporal, causality, and outcome evaluation.
    Their concept to use spatiotemporal evaluation to predict future behaviour of
    humans is like the proposed IoTCrawler approach, disregarding that we evaluate
    past events. Prior work of the authors emphasised the importance of an appropriate
    distance model reflecting infrastructure, e.g., roads, and physics, i.e. traffic
    or air movements [39]. The approach in IoTCrawler refines the state of the art
    by utilising sensor and domain independent correlation and interpolation models
    whilst incorporating knowledge of the city infrastructure to evaluate data stream
    plausibility. 7.4.4 Conclusion This part presents the key ideas and the architecture
    of a crawling and discovery engine for the Internet of Things resources and their
    data. We describe our work in the context of the H2020 IoTCrawler project, which
    proposes a framework to make possible the effective search over IoT resources.
    The system goes beyond the state of the art through adaptive, privacy-aware and
    secure algorithms and mechanisms for crawling, indexing and search in distributed
    IoT systems. Innovative technological developments are proposed as enablers to
    support any IoT scenario. We discuss four use cases of the platform, which are
    presented in the areas of Smart Cities, Social IoT, Smart Energy and Industry
    4.0. The project is currently implementing the envisaged framework, at the same
    time the main interoperability issues are considered to support the real-life
    uses cases identified. This work has been sponsored by the European Commission,
    through the IoTCrawler project (contract 779852), and the Spanish Ministry of
    Economy and Competitiveness through the Torres Quevedo program (reference PTQ-15-08073).
    7.5 SecureIoT: Multi-Layer Architecture for Predictive End-to-End Internet-of-Things
    Security The proliferation and rising sophistication of Internet of Things (IoT)
    infrastructures and applications comes with a wave of new cybersecurity challenges.
    This is evident in several notorious security incidents on IoT devices and applications,
    which have occurred during the last couple of years. These include the “Lizard
    Stressor” attacks on home routers (January 2015), the 1.4 million cars that were
    recalled by Chrysler due to potential hacking of their control software (July
    2015), Tesla’s autopilot crash (July 2016), as well as the first large scale distributed
    denial of service (DDoS) attack based on IoT devices (October 2016). Most of these
    incidents are directly associated with the complexity, heterogeneity and dynamic
    behaviour of emerging IoT deployments, which poses security challenges, which
    can be hardly addressed by state of the art platforms. Some of the most prominent
    of these challenges, include: The fact that they provided limited support for
    end-to-end security, since they lack mechanisms that address IoT security at all
    levels, i.e. from the field and devices level to the edge and cloud levels. Moreover,
    existing security solutions tend to be framed within a single platform and ecosystem
    and cannot effectively operate in scenarios involving multiple platforms and ecosystems
    [41]. Their inability to deal with very volatile and dynamic environments comprising
    networks of smart objects. State-of-the-art IoT platforms and their security mechanisms
    provide within cloud-based environments that ensure cybersecurity for large numbers
    of IoT devices. Nevertheless, they make only limited provisions for dynamic applications
    involving networks of smart objects (i.e. objects with (semi)autonomous behaviour).
    In the latter, IoT devices and smart objects are likely to join or leave, while
    security and privacy policies can also change dynamically and without prior notice.
    Hence, to support large scale interactions across multiple IoT platforms and networks
    of smart objects, there should be some means of predicting and anticipating the
    security behaviour and trustworthiness of an IoT entity (e.g., device, platform,
    groups of objects) prior to interacting with it. SecureIoT is motived by the need
    to support cyber-security in scenarios involving cross-platform interactions and
    interactions across networks of smart objects (i.e. objects with semi-autonomous
    behaviour and embedded intelligence), which require more dynamic, scalable, decentralized
    and intelligent IoT security mechanisms. To this end, it introduces a multi-layer,
    data-driven security architecture, which collects and processes information from
    the field, edge and cloud layers of an IoT system, in order to identify security
    threats at all these layers and accordingly to drive notifications and early preparedness
    to confront them. Furthermore, SecureIoT foresees cross-layer coordination mechanisms
    and will employees advanced analytics towards a holistic and intelligent approach
    that will predict and anticipate secure incident in order to timely confront them.
    Also, SecureIoT introduces a range of security interoperability mechanisms in
    order to support cross-vertical and cross-platform cyber-security scenarios. The
    SecureIoT architecture serves as basis for the provision of security services
    to IoT developers, deployers and platform providers, including a risk assessment,
    a compliance auditing and a secure programming support service. In this context,
    the rest of this chapter is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces the SecureIoT
    architecture and its main principles. Section 3 discusses the security services
    to be offered by the project, while Section 4 presents some use cases that will
    be used to validate the project’s results. 7.5.1 SecureIoT Architecture 7.5.1.1
    SecureIoT architecture overview Figure 7.10. provides a high-level overview of
    the security architecture of the project. The architecture provides placeholders
    for predictive IoT security mechanisms, which can be contributed by different
    security experts in order to protect IoT infrastructures and services. In the
    scope of SecureIoT the partners will specify and implement such mechanisms in
    the areas of security monitoring and predictive analysis, which will serve as
    a basis for supporting the project’s use cases. Nevertheless, the project’s architecture
    is more general and therefore able to accommodate additional algorithms and building
    blocks. The architecture complies with the reference architectures specified by
    the Industrial Internet Consortium (IIC) and the OpenFog consortium [42], as it
    specifies: (i) The field level, where IoT devices (including smart objects) reside;
    (ii) The fog/edge level, which controls multiple devices close to the edge of
    the network. Note that the fog/edge level might be the first security layer in
    an IoT application, especially when resource constrained devices are deployed;
    (iii) The enterprise and platform levels, which reside at the core and where application
    and platform level security measures are applicable. Moreover, the SecureIoT architecture
    will also specify: Figure 7.10 Overview of SecureIoT Architecture. Interfaces
    for (security) data collection at all levels of the security architecture, including
    monitoring probes that are deployed at all levels. Data analytics modules (including
    AI and predictive analysis) at all levels, which extract insights about the future
    security state of the IoT infrastructure and applications. Semi-automated Policy
    Enforcement Points (PEPs), which are driven by predictive insights and enforce
    policies at different levels. PEPs will provide the means for enforcing security
    and cryptographic functionalities, configuring IoT platforms and devices for enhanced
    security, as well as for distributing security sensitive datasets. Multi-level
    security mechanisms and measures, which combine security monitoring, analytics
    and insights from multiple levels. Applicable policies and security measures are
    driven by regulations (e.g., GDPR), directives (e.g., NIS, ePrivacy) and standards
    (such as ISO27001 [43]). The ultimate goal of the architecture is to provide concrete
    services such as the SECaaS. The delivery of these services is facilitated by
    the development and maintenance of a security knowledge base, where metadata about
    IoT entities (i.e. objects platforms etc.) are registered along with knowledge
    collected and summarized based on multiple publicly available threat intelligence
    sources. Note that the security services of the architecture are offered as a
    service based on a Security-as-a-Service (SECaaS) paradigm. This however does
    not imply that the security services are solely deployed in the cloud. Rather,
    they can be offered based on a combination of cloud-based SaaS (Software-as-a-Service)
    security services and FaaS (Fog-as-a-Service) functions provided at the fog level.
    7.5.1.2 Intelligent data collection and monitoring probes Assessing and optimizing
    the security posture of IoT components require the collection and the processing
    of their respective monitoring and configuration data. The produced monitoring
    data will allow IoT stakeholders to assess the security posture of their IoT platforms,
    to predict security issues, to enforce policies for hardening systems, to prevent
    network misuse, to quantify business risk, and to collaborate with partners to
    identify and mitigate threats. The collection of these data requires the development
    of dedicated probes and monitoring layers at different levels of the deployed
    IoT platform (device, network, edge and core) to capture a comprehensive and a
    complete view of its operations and interactions. In SecureIoT, monitoring probes
    will be provided to support the collection of log data, including network flows
    and software configurations, at the component, services and network levels. A
    key characteristic of SecureIoT’s security monitoring infrastructure (and related
    probes) will be its built-in intelligence in the data collection and pre-processing
    mechanisms, which will be implemented over the SecureIoT monitoring probes that
    will interfaces to different IoT platforms. As part of this intelligence, the
    data collection mechanisms will ensure data quality, data filtering, as well as
    adaptive selection of the needed data sources based on dynamic changes to the
    configuration of the IoT platforms, applications and smart objects. In order to
    implement this intelligence, the monitoring probes will be enhanced with data
    streaming analytics mechanisms, which will be able to process security-related
    information sources on the fly (i.e. almost at real-time) in order to adapt the
    filtering and data collection accordingly. This data collection intelligence will
    facilitate fast processing, as well as the implementation of predictive analytics
    schemes. 7.5.1.3 SecureIoT systems layers and information flows Figure 7.11. presents
    the layers of a SecureIoT compliant system, with emphasis on the flow of information
    from an IoT platform to the SecureIoT SECaaS services. The following layers are
    presented: Figure 7.11 Layers of SecureIoT systems. A layer of an individual IoT
    platform or system, which typically comprises network, devices/field, edge/fog,
    cloud and application-level components. These components are usually part of the
    target IoT platform or systems that needs to be secured based on SecureIoT. A
    data collection layer, which comprises the above-mentioned security monitoring
    probes. Note that probes will be specified and developed for all parts and components
    of the IoT system i.e. from the network and devices components all the way up
    to the IoT applications’ components. A data analytics layer, which is destined
    to process the data derived from the various probes. This layer is empowered by
    data analytics algorithms, but also by a range of cybersecurity templates, which
    specify rules and patterns of the security incidents that are to be identified.
    Taking network-level attacks as example, templates for specific types of network
    attacks will be specified such as TCP SYN attacks, UDP flood attacks, HTTP POST
    DoS (Denial of Service) attacks [43]. Each of the templates will comprise the
    rules and conditions under which the attacks will be identified. Likewise, templates
    for other types of attacks, including application specific ones will be specified
    and used. Along with these templates, the data analytics layer will comprise a
    contextualization component, which will be used to judge whether the attacks indicators
    are abnormal for the given IoT platform and application context. A cross-platform
    layer, which is destined to aggregate and correlate information derived from multiple-IoT
    platforms. It will serve as a basis for identifying attack indicators in cross-platform
    scenarios. All of the above layers and components will leverage the services of
    a knowledge base that will comprise information and knowledge about IoT-related
    cybersecurity attacks. It will be also used to drive the operation of the IoT
    security templates and the contextualization component. 7.5.1.4 Mapping to RAMI
    4.0 layers SecureIoT is destined to support cybersecurity scenarios in both consumer
    and industrial settings. In order to strengthen the industrial relevance of the
    project’s architecture, the project will provide a mapping of the main building
    blocks of the SecureIoT architecture to the Reference Architecture Model Industry4.0
    (RAMI 4.0) [45]. While this mapping is work in progress, the following associations
    and mappings are envisaged: The SecureIoT field layer, maps to the Field and Control
    Device hierarchy levels of RAMI4.0, as well as to its Asset Integration layer.
    The SecureIoT edge layer, maps tot eh Station and Workcenter hierarchy levels
    of RAMI4.0, as well as to its Asset, Integration and Communication layers. The
    SecureIoT cloud layer, maps to the Workcenter, Enterprise and Connected World
    hierarchy levels of RAMI4.0, as well as to its Information, Functional and Business
    layers. The SecureIoT application layer, maps to the Enterprise and Connected
    World hierarchy levels of RAMI4.0, as well as to its Business layer. The SecureIoT
    data collection layer, maps to the Field Device, Control Device, Station and Work
    Centers hierarchy levels of RAMI4.0, as well as to its Communication and Information
    layers. The SecureIoT analytics layer, maps to the Enterprise and Connected World
    hierarchy levels of RAMI4.0, as well as to its Information layer. The SecureIoT
    management layer, maps to the Enterprise and Connected World hierarchy levels
    of RAMI4.0, as well as to its Information, Functional and Business layers. 7.5.2
    SecureIoT Services Based on its architecture, the project will offer risk assessment,
    compliance auditing and programmers’ support services as outlined in the following
    paragraphs. 7.5.2.1 Risk assessment (RA) services The SecureIoT RA services will
    aim at an efficient balance between realizing opportunities for gains, while minimizing
    vulnerabilities and losses. They will strive to ensure that an acceptable level
    of security is provided at an affordable cost. The SecureIoT framework will quantify
    risks in terms of a “likelihood factor”, which will be calculated based on combination
    of the probability and impact of any identified vulnerabilities. This “likelihood
    factor” will be appropriately weighted and ultimately normalized based on a risk
    calculation model in-line with NIST’s Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS).
    Special emphasis will be paid in evaluating the criticality of risks associated
    with the behaviour and the operation of smart objects, as well as of services
    spanning multiple platforms. SecureIoT will therefore formulate a formal methodology
    and an accompanying model that will produce risk quantifications based on the
    identified vulnerabilities, potential threats and the impact estimation per potentially
    successful exploitation. SecureIoT will develop a risk quantification engine based
    on an expert system, which will provide flexibility in implementing different
    rules and assign different rates to the various risks. 7.5.2.2 Compliance auditing
    services This service will be delivered as a tool available to solution deployers,
    operators and end-users. Based on information collected through the security analytics,
    including the information of the IoT knowledge base. It will provide support for
    a set of security and privacy controls on the IoT infrastructures at multiple
    levels. The tool will be configured to support auditing of IoT infrastructures
    and services, against existing sets of security and privacy controls. The auditing
    will identify non-compliant behaviours and will provide recommendations about
    areas that require attention. Several prominent sets of security and privacy rules
    that will be supported concerning controls and measures specified in the scope
    of the GDRP regulation, NIS and ePrivacy directives. 7.5.2.3 Programming support
    services This service will enable developers to secure applications as part of
    their programming efforts. In particular, it will enable them to: (a) Enforce
    Distributed Access Control; (b) Ensure the cryptographic protection of data; and
    (c) Physical distribute sensitive data for enhanced security. These activities
    will be supported based on programming annotations, which will specify distributed
    access control, cryptographic protection and physical data distribution activities.
    A series of source generation, bytecode transformation and runtime reflection
    actions will be undertaken at specified Policy Enforcement Points (PEPs), which
    will be implemented at various levels i.e. the device, edge, core and application
    layers of the SecureIoT architecture. To this end, along with the security monitoring
    probes, the SecureIoT architecture will provide the means for configuring elements
    at the PEPs. 7.5.3 Validating Use Cases The project’s architecture and services
    will be validated in three use cases, which are briefly discussed in the following
    paragraphs. 7.5.3.1 Industrial plants’ security The use case will focus on plant
    networks for operations and support – e.g. SCADA, MES, PLCs, etc. – and enterprise
    networks connected to IoT-platforms providing support for automation and supply
    chain collaboration. The technical approach of the industrial IoT use case is
    twofold as reliability and availability of real world production must not be brought
    at risk. The following security challenges will be addressed, based on the SecureIoT
    services: Secure operations of connected factories with thread prediction: The
    SecureIoT risk assessment service will be therefore used to predict security issues
    arising from deployed automation technologies in a multi-vendor environment. Furthermore,
    SecureIoT’s prediction and mitigation services will enable the plant control to
    draw the right conclusions and prepare for attacks before they emerge. Compliance
    and Protection of product/user data in a multi-vendor environment: Factories need
    to protect product and user data sets. SecureIoT will be used in order to enforce
    privacy and data protection policies. Likewise, the compliance auditing SecureIoT
    service will be also used to identify and remedy gaps in the industrial IoT environment.
    Predictive Maintenance and Avoiding Machine Break-Downs in “Human in the Loop”
    Scenarios: Predictive maintenance requires trustworthy exchange, storage and processing
    of sensor and asset management datasets. Security analytics of IoT application
    level entities will be exploited as part of the SecureIoT risk assessment service
    in order to proactively identify issues with transmission and protection of datasets
    involved in the predictive maintenance process, in order to ensure the reliability
    of the process and avoid damages/losses in scenarios where machines foretell their
    lifetime and initiative actions in the supply chain (e.g., ordering of spare parts,
    scheduling of maintenance). 7.5.3.2 Socially assistive robots This use case will
    focus on security challenges associated with the integration of a socially assistive
    robot (i.e. QT robot from SecureIoT partner LuxAI) with a cloud-based IoT platform.
    This integration will target the delivery of personalized ambient assisted living
    functionalities, such as personalized rehabilitation and coaching exercises. In
    order to support these applications a dense IoT network, enable continuous interaction
    between IoT devices, robots, human users and the environment will be established.
    The integration challenge will however lie on keeping track of the state of the
    robot and the environment, as well as on implementing distributed task assignment
    strategies (such as the Consensus-Based Bundle Algorithm (CBBA)), which enable
    the distribution of application logic across different smart objects. The following
    security challenges will be addressed: Network and message security: The SecureIoT
    risk assessment and mitigation services will be used to identify threats associated
    with communications and network performance in order to appropriately adapt the
    operation of the application (e.g., stop the training if needed and deliver proper
    alerts to users). Prediction and avoidance of dangerous/risky situations: SecureIoT
    will monitor the robots’ operation both at the software level (i.e. through information
    flow tracking) in order to identify possible hacking of the robot, but also at
    the application level in order to detect abnormal operation/behaviour that can
    lead at risk. Secure programming environment for robotics missions: The programming
    interfaces of the robot will be enhanced with SecureIoT programming model and
    annotations in order to enable the developer of a rehabilitation mission to enforce
    policies specified in some policy language such as XACML (eXtensible Access Control
    Markup Language). Compliance to GDPR: An analysis of the application for GDPR
    compliance will take place, including automated identification of non-compliance
    risks (based on the SecureIoT risk assessment) and subsequent implementation of
    GDRP compliant policies based on the secure programming XACML-based mechanisms.
    7.5.3.3 Connected car use cases This use case concerns security in connected cars
    scenarios, including: (i) Usage Based Insurance scenarios where vehicle data are
    analysed to assess driver behaviour and hence determine risks in order to better
    tailor insurance premiums for the customers; and (ii) Warnings on traffic and
    road conditions, that involve analysing data coming from multiple vehicles to
    understand the traffic conditions in different locations. From the point of view
    of cybersecurity for the usage-based insurance, it is important to ensure that
    the data transmitted is only accessible by the responsible organisation (privacy)
    and that the system cannot be corrupted such that a risky driver appears to be
    low risk. Moreover, the integrity of the data is a key requirement to ensure that
    insurance premiums are calculated fairly based on objectively assessed risk using
    accurate and trusted data. Likewise, for the traffic and road condition warnings
    it is vital that the data sent to the car is an accurate interpretation of the
    data provided from each vehicle. It This is because the system could be used maliciously
    to create congestion if the data is corrupted. Moreover, integrity of software
    running in the connected car is crucial. Recent attacks or security alarms raised
    has been focused on taking control over IoT devices and gateways. Over the air
    firmware update could be used as a countermeasure mechanism after an anomalous
    (or malware) detection. To address these challenges, the SecureIoT risk assessment
    framework will be employed, including predictive risk assessment functionalities.
    In case of identified issues, preventive measures will be activated (i.e. enforcement
    of data protection policies, provision of alerts to end-users, instigation and
    scheduling of over the air updates). 7.5.4 Conclusion SecureIoT is a first of
    a kind attempt to introduce a standards-based architecture for end-to-end IoT
    security. The project’s architecture is aligned to recent standards for industrial
    IoT security, including standards of the Industrial Internet Consortium and the
    OpenFog consortium. It makes provisions for collecting and analysing data from
    all layers of an IoT platform, while at the same time catering from cross platform
    and cross layer security analysis. Moreover, the SecureIoT architecture provides
    the means for defining and executing security actions at specific PEPs, as a means
    of enforcing policies and instigating mitigation actions. Based on this architecture,
    the project will implement risk assessment, compliance and the programming support
    services. SecureIoT is currently in its requirements engineering and specification
    phase, while it has also commenced its architecture specification activities.
    As part of the latter, the project will provide a mapping of its architectural
    concepts to the RAMI4.0 reference model. Moreover, the project will start the
    implementation of the data collection and data analytics mechanisms that will
    underpin the realization of the architecture and of its services. The project
    holds the promise to enhance the functionalities and lower the costs for securing
    IoT applications spanning multiple IoT platforms and smart objects. We will aspire
    to disseminate more detailed results through publications, presentations and other
    activities of the IERC cluster in the coming ten months. This work has been carried
    out in the scope of the H2020 SecureIoT project, which is funded by the European
    Commission in the scope of its H2020 programme (contract number 779899). The authors
    acknowledge valuable help and contributions from all partners of the project.
    7.6 SEMIoTICS 7.6.1 Brief Overview SEMIoTICS aims to develop a pattern-driven
    framework, built upon existing IoT platforms, to enable and guarantee secure and
    dependable actuation and semi-autonomic behaviour in IoT/IIoT applications. Patterns
    will encode proven dependencies between security, privacy, dependability, and
    interoperability (SPDI) properties of individual smart objects and corresponding
    properties of orchestrations involving them. The SEMIoTICS framework will support
    cross-layer intelligent dynamic adaptation, including heterogeneous smart objects,
    networks and clouds, addressing effective adaptation and autonomic behaviour at
    field (edge) and infrastructure (backend) layers based on intelligent analysis
    and learning. To address the complexity and scalability needs within horizontal
    and vertical domains, SEMIoTICS will develop and integrate smart programmable
    networking and semantic interoperability mechanisms. The practicality of the above
    approach will be validated using three diverse usage scenarios in the areas of
    renewable energy (addressing IIoT), healthcare (focusing on human-centric IoT),
    and smart sensing (covering both IIoT and IoT); and will be offered through an
    open Application Programming Interface (API). SEMIoTICS consortium consists of
    strong European industry (Siemens, Engineering, STMicroelectronics), innovative
    SMEs (Sphynx, Iquadrat, BlueSoft) and academic partners (FORTH, Uni Passau, CTTC)
    covering the whole value chain of IoT, local embedded analytics and their programmable
    connectivity to the cloud IoT platforms with associated security and privacy.
    The consortium is striving for a common vision of creating EU’s technological
    capability of innovative IoT landscape both at European and international level.
    7.6.2 Introduction Global networks like IoT create an enormous potential for new
    generations of IoT applications, by leveraging synergies arising through the convergence
    of consumer, business and industrial Internet, and creating open, global networks
    connecting people, data, and “things”. A series of innovations across the IoT
    landscape have converged to make IoT products, platforms, and devices, technically
    and economically feasible. However, despite these advancements the realization
    of the IoT potential requires overcoming significant business and technical hurdles.
    This includes several system aspects, including dynamicity, scalability, heterogeneity,
    and E2E security and privacy [46–48], as they are described below. IoT are dynamic,
    ever-evolving and often unpredictable environments. This relates to both IoT infrastructures
    as a whole (e.g. rapid development of new smart objects and IoT applications introducing
    new requirements to existing infrastructures and networks) and individual IoT
    applications (e.g. new users and types of objects connecting to said applications).
    This necessitates dynamically adaptive behaviour at runtime, at the IoT infrastructure,
    the IoT applications, and locally at the smart objects integrated by them. Intrinsic
    requirements (e.g. scale, latency) dictate the need for, at least, semi-autonomic
    adaptation at all layers. The fast-growing number of interconnected users, smart
    objects and applications requires high scalability of the IoT infrastructure and
    network layers. At the network, the vastly increased demands require highly efficient
    programmable connectivity, service provisioning and chaining in ways that guarantee
    the much-needed end-to-end (E2E) optimizations, addressing dynamic IoT application
    requirements. Scalability at the IoT infrastructure level requires seamless discovery
    and bootstrapping of smart objects, as well as highly efficient orchestration,
    event processing and analytics and IoT platform integration. Despite advancements
    in standardization, there is still limited semantic interoperability within IoT
    applications and platforms. Semantic interoperability requires three key abilities:
    (a) to recognize and balance the heterogeneous capabilities and constraints of
    smart objects, (b) to interpret data generated by such objects correctly, and
    (c) to establish meaningful connections between heterogeneous IoT platforms. Smart
    objects, IoT applications, and their enabling platforms are often vulnerable to
    security attacks and changing operating and context conditions that can compromise
    their security [49]. They also generate, make use of, and interrelate massive
    personal data in ways that can potentially breach legal and privacy requirements
    [49]. Preserving security and privacy properties remains a particularly challenging
    problem, due to the difficulty of: (a) analysing vulnerabilities in the complex
    E2E compositions of heterogeneous smart objects, (b) selecting appropriate controls
    (e.g., different schemes for ID and key management, different encryption mechanisms,
    etc.), for smart objects with heterogeneous resources/constraints, and (c) preserving
    E2E security and privacy under dynamic changes in IoT applications and security
    incidents, in the context of the ever-evolving IoT threat landscape [50]. The
    above challenges give rise to significant complexities and relate to the implementation
    and deployment stack of IoT applications to address them. The overall aim is:
    demands without considering the data volume. Taking into consideration this ratio,
    green IT technologies have important environmental and economic benefits. Circular
    Economy (CE) advocates a continuous development cycle that reforms the currently
    prominent ‘take-make-dispose’ linear economic mode by preserving and enhancing
    the natural capital. SEMIoTICS will also provide the intelligence analytics capabilities
    and Information Communication Technologies (ICT) that are required for turning
    IoT data into a worthy asset for CE-centric businesses (e.g. [51]). 7.6.3 Vision
    The main goal of the SEMIoTICS project is to develop a pattern-driven framework,
    built upon existing IoT platforms. The proposed framework will enable and guarantee
    the secure and dependable actuation and semi-automatic behaviour in IoT/IIoT applications.
    Specifically, the SEMIoTICS vision in delivering smart, secure, scalable, heterogeneous
    network and data-driven IoT is based on two key features: Pattern-driven approach:
    Patterns are re-usable solutions to common problems and building blocks to architectures.
    In SEMIoTICS, patterns encode proven dependencies between security, privacy, dependability
    and interoperability (SPDI) properties of individual smart objects and corresponding
    properties of orchestrations (composition) involving them. The encoding of such
    dependencies enables: (i) the verification that a smart object orchestration satisfies
    certain SPDI properties, and (ii) the generation (and adaptation) of orchestrations
    in ways that are guaranteed to satisfy required SPDI properties. The SEMIoTICS
    approach to patterns is inspired from similar pattern-based approaches used in
    service-oriented systems [52, 53], cyber physical systems [54] and networks [55,
    56]. Multi-layered Embedded Intelligence: Effective adaptation and autonomic behaviour
    at field (edge) and infrastructure (backend) layers depends critically on intelligent
    analysis and learning the circumstances where adaptation actions did not work
    as expected. Intelligent analysis is needed locally for semi-autonomous, prompt
    reaction, but taking into account IoT smart objects limited resources (thus requiring
    specialized lightweight algorithms) [55, 57]. It should also be possible to fuse
    local intelligence to enable and enhance analysis and intelligent behaviour at
    higher levels (e.g. using results of local analysis of “thing events” to globally
    predict and anticipate failure rates) [58]. 7.6.4 Objectives The SEMIoTICS project
    will target IoT applications with heterogeneous smart objects, various IoT platforms
    and different SPDI requirements. Seven main objectives are identified by the SEMIoTICS
    project including: The development of patterns for orchestration of smart objects
    and IoT platform enablers with guaranteed SPDI properties The development of semantic
    interoperability mechanisms for smart objects, networks, and IoT platforms, like
    semantic information broker that resolve the semantics of correlated ontologies
    and common APIs that enable cross-platform programming and interaction The development
    of dynamically and self-adaptable monitoring mechanisms, supporting integrated
    and predictive monitoring of smart objects in a scalable manner The development
    of core mechanisms for multi-layered embedded intelligence, IoT application adaptation,
    learning and evolution, and E2E security, privacy, accountability and user control
    The development of IoT-aware programmable networking capabilities based on adaptation
    and Software-Defined Networking (SDN)/Network Function Virtualization (NFV) orchestration
    The development of a reference prototype open architecture demonstrated and evaluated
    in both IIoT (renewable energy) and IoT (healthcare), as well as in a horizontal
    use case bridging the two landscapes (smart sensing), and delivery of the respective
    open API The adaptation of EU technology offerings internationally These objectives
    are accomplished, considering the intrinsic requirements of three main use case
    scenarios for an industrial wind park, an e-health system, and a smart sensing
    setting. 7.6.5 Technical Approach Figure 7.12 shows our initial vision of the
    logical architecture of SEMIoTICS framework and how it relates to smart objects,
    IoT applications, and existing IoT platforms, and how does it map onto a generic
    deployment infrastructure consisting of private and public clouds, networks, and
    field devices. Within the figure, blue boxes show components of the framework
    that are to be developed by SEMIoTICS; white boxes indicate components of IoT
    applications managed by the framework. The key role of the SEMIoTICS framework
    in the IIoT/IoT implementation stack is to support the secure, dependable and
    privacy-preserving connectivity and interoperability of IoT applications and smart
    objects used by them, and the management, monitoring and adaptation of these applications,
    objects and their connectivity. Figure 7.12 SEMIoTICS architecture (deployment
    and logic views). 7.6.5.1 Enhanced IoT aware software defined networks The sheer
    number of smart objects that are expected to connect to the Internet by 2020 (more
    than 50bn smart objects) will increase network traffic dramatically and introduce
    more diversity of network traffic (from elephant flows to mice flows). This makes
    the development of networking techniques that are significantly more scalable
    and agile than today’s networks an absolute necessity. Networks will need to dynamically
    reconfigure their resources and maintain network connectivity. Also, applications
    running on top of smart connected devices will need to be resource and network-aware,
    in order to take full advantage of underlying network programmability. In summary,
    IoT requires more agile networks. SDN can provide a solution to this problem.
    It allows network programmability, which can be used to decouple network control
    from the forwarding network (aka data) plane and to make the latter directly programmable
    by the former. Integrating IoT and SDN will increase network efficiency as it
    will make it possible for a network to respond to changes or events detected at
    the IoT application layer through network reconfiguration. If a spontaneous concentration
    of people in a specific place is detected by an IoT application, for example,
    the application can send a request to the SDN controller to reconfigure the network
    and provide more bandwidth to the area before network congestion occurs. As another
    example, consider an IoT application where sensor readings are transmitted periodically.
    In such cases, network resources on the path connecting the sensors to the backend
    IoT application can be reserved during the reporting cycles to enable efficient
    flows and released outside them. SEMIoTICS aims to develop a middleware layer
    between the IoT applications and the SDN-controlled field network, abstracting
    the underlying protocol implementations and SDN APIs. This will allow IoT applications
    to trigger the network reconfiguration through pattern-driven adaptations. In
    this view, SDN becomes another component in the IoT implementation stack which,
    like other components, can be dynamically configured through SPDI patterns [56].
    7.6.5.2 Localized analytics for Semi-Autonomous IIoT operation An IDC FutureScape
    report [59] for IoT reported that by 2018, 40 percent of IoT data will be stored,
    processed, analysed and acted where they are created before they are transferred
    to the network. There are two main reasons for this: big data volume and fast
    reaction. First of all, IoTs/IIoTs are generating an unprecedented volume and
    variety of data depending on the vertical use case. Not all these data need to
    be sent always to the cloud for storage and processing. Indeed, the volume of
    the data makes it in many cases extremely difficult to process them globally in
    an efficient manner and hinders learning the relations that are hidden in the
    data. For this reason, we need to enrich the generated and collected data with
    semantic information at the source and intermediate stations, process them locally
    with machine learning algorithms to extract the most important features of the
    data and only then transfer the learned local features to the cloud for further,
    global, processing and feature analysis. Hence, new approaches, techniques, and
    corresponding designs need to be developed to store, analyse, and derive insight
    from these data sets. This has already been identified as a challenge by the industry,
    e.g. Forrester [60] highlighting the need of IoT applications for distributed
    analytics since centralized analytics cannot cope for many IoT usage scenarios,
    and Gartner [61] emphasizing the importance of IoT edge architecture and IT/OT
    integration for achieving such distributed and layered data analysis. The second
    reason driving the need for localized analytics is fast reaction. By the time
    the data makes its way to the cloud for analysis and some analysis results have
    been obtained and transferred back to the field layer, so much time has passed
    that the opportunity to act effectively on the obtained analysis results at the
    field layer (e.g. smart actuation) is usually long gone. Again, this is a crucial
    requirement for the industry – Forbes and Moor Insights & Strategy (MI&S) [62]
    expects that machine learning-enabled reaction to changes in the current environmental/system
    context to be essential for IoT solutions. By 2020 MI&S believes that the machine
    learning at edge combined with central machine learning in cloud arrangements
    will exist in a large number of solutions and will account for a great deal of
    the innovation in IoT world – giving a substantial market advantage to the providers
    of such solutions. By doing a fast analysis on the local data (whose volume is
    much reduced compared to the entire data produced by the IIoT/IoT system and thus
    should be analysable with substantially fewer resources), an IIoT/IoT system can
    react quickly to context changes and adapt to them, in ways that optimise the
    use of both its own resources and the environment’s, and eventually improving
    the overall user experience. SEMIoTICS will develop localized analytics at the
    edge for semi-autonomous operation with smart actuation and use the results of
    the localized analytics to help improve the subsequent, global analysis that will
    be performed on the cloud for learning across the whole system and extraction
    of global patterns – itself a task whose results can be used by local analytics
    mechanisms to improve their performance and be able to proactively react to situations
    that had not been observed at that local point in the past but had occurred at
    other parts of the system. 7.6.6 Security Architecture Concept As aforementioned,
    the SEMIoTICS vision is articulated around the development of a framework for
    smart object and IIoT/IoT application management based on trusted patterns, monitoring
    and adaptation mechanisms, enhanced IoT centric networks and multi-layered embedded
    intelligence. These core elements of our approach are described below. 7.6.6.1
    Pattern-based trustworthy IIoT/IoT The key element enabling the SEMIoTICS approach
    is the use of architectural SPDI patterns. These patterns define generic ways
    of composing (i.e., establishing the connectivity between) and configuring the
    heterogeneous smart objects and software components that may exist at all layers
    of the IoT applications implementation stack, including: sensors and actuators;
    smart devices; software components at the network, cloud, IoT enabling platforms
    and/or other middleware layer; as well as software components at the IoT application
    layer. To do so, patterns specify abstract and generic smart object interaction
    and orchestration protocols, enhanced (if necessary) by transformations to ensure
    the semantic compatibility of data. Furthermore (and more importantly), the smart
    object interaction and orchestration protocols encoded by the patterns must have
    proven ability (i.e., an ability proven through formal verification or demonstrated
    through testing and/or operational evidence) to achieve not only a semantically
    viable interoperability between the smart objects that they compose but also specific
    SPDI properties, which may be required of compositions. The compositions defined
    by patterns are both vertical and horizontal, i.e., they can involve smart objects
    at the same (horizontal) or different layers (vertical) layer of the IoT implementation
    stack. As an example of a pattern that guarantees “data integrity” – i.e., absence
    of unauthorized modifications of data – consider the integrity preserving cascade
    composition pattern discussed in [63, 64]. According to this pattern in a sequential
    composition of processes P1, …, Pn where the input data of Pi are meant to be
    the output data of Pi-1, and the communication between Pi-1 to Pi (i=2,…, n) is
    based on an orchestrator O which facilitates data transfers from Pi-1 to Pi, overall
    data integrity is preserved if data integrity is preserved within each Pi, within
    O and across all communications from PiS to O and vice versa. The integrity cascade
    composition pattern applies both to horizontal compositions (e.g., in software
    services workflows as in [63, 64]) and vertical composition (e.g., in transfer
    of data in invocation of operations of IoT enabling middleware). Another (more
    complex) example of a pattern fitting the SEMIoTICS vision is the synchronously
    controlled distribution line (SCDL) pattern discussed in [54]. SCDL guarantees
    that a distributed asynchronous sensor system installed upon a physical pipeline
    (e.g., a pipeline of an electricity distribution network) will operate in virtual
    synchrony and provide a guaranteed density of readings (i.e., a bounded minimum
    number of readings per distant and per time unit). The pattern suggests a composition
    consisting of: (i) sensors connected to a controller through a middleware component
    that realizes a bounded reliable message delivery protocol; (ii) a controller
    with the capability to authenticate sensors, store readings received from them
    in fixed length intervals, and substitute missing or corrupted sensor readings
    with synthetic readings computed through the linear interpolation of readings
    from their closest adjacent sensors and the end of reading intervals. The application
    of the SCDL pattern is proven to guarantee the consumption of readings at the
    end of the reading interval where they fit, make them available in a synchronous
    manner, filter out illegitimate readings and produce readings of the required
    density for the pipeline. In SCDL pattern, these properties are guaranteed even
    in the presence of missing or corrupted raw data, as long as there is a minimal
    number of legitimate sensor readings. Examples of additional patterns have been
    given in [52] and [56]. These include patterns for confidentiality in service
    orchestrations and patterns for availability in Software Defined Networks, respectively.
    Inspired by these earlier works, SEMIoTICS patterns will develop patterns specifying:
    Composition structures for integrating smart objects and components of IoT enabling
    platforms (e.g., platform enablers) in a manner that guarantees SPDI properties.
    The E2E SPDI properties that the compositions expressed by the pattern preserve.
    The component level SPDI properties that the types of smart objects and/or components
    orchestrated by the pattern, must satisfy in order to preserve the end-to-end
    SPD properties. Additional conditions that need to be satisfied for guaranteeing
    end-to-end SPDI properties. These may, for example, include configuration conditions
    that need to be satisfied by the IoT platforms and the networks providing the
    connectivity between them, for guarantying the end-to-end availability properties
    of IoT application (composition). Monitoring checks that must be monitored at
    runtime in order to verify that any assumptions about the individual smart objects
    and components that are orchestrated by a pattern or other operational conditions,
    which are critical for the preservation of the end-to-end SPDI properties of the
    pattern, hold at runtime. Adaptation actions that may be undertaken to adapt IoT
    applications, which realise the composition structure of the pattern, at runtime.
    Such actions may, for example, include the replacement of individual smart objects
    within a composition; the adaptation of the process realizing the composition;
    the modification of the configuration of the network services used to connect
    the smart objects of the composition and/or the deployment platforms upon which
    these objects run. Adaptation actions are specified along with guard conditions
    determining when they can be executed (guards are monitored, and adaptation is
    triggered when they are satisfied). SEMIoTICS will also develop a generic engine
    supporting the execution of patterns at runtime to realize the overall process
    of monitoring, forming, adapting and managing smart object orchestrations in IoT
    applications. 7.6.6.2 Monitoring and adaptation The SEMIoTICS framework will support
    evolving runtime management and adaptation of IoT applications and smart objects
    [55–58]. Adaptation will be triggered by monitoring the guard conditions of the
    patterns used by the IoT application of interest, and applying the actions defined
    in the patterns when such conditions are satisfied. The SEMIoTICS framework will
    also monitor and analyse the effectiveness of patterns and the adaptation actions
    undertaken in reference to the contextual and operational conditions in which
    they were undertaken. This will be to identify deficiencies or failures in applying
    the patterns, to diagnose the reasons which may have caused deficiencies or failures
    and avoid the application of the same pattern(s) under the same conditions in
    subsequent phases. The use of a specific type of network connectivity or a specific
    type of sensor object amongst alternative options may, for example, prove to be
    a non-optimal option for network performance or sensor signal reliability under
    particular conditions. Similarly, certain data transformations may prove excessively
    time consuming for achieving the required scalability in an IoT application. Monitoring
    will also be necessary to ensure that any component level SPDI properties assumed
    by the pattern are upheld whilst the pattern is active (i.e., in use) in an IoT
    application. Beyond the basic monitoring of the contextual circumstances surrounding
    the operation of different smart objects and IoT applications, the SEMIoTICS framework
    will incorporate learning and evolution mechanisms supporting the analysis of
    any adaptation and configuration actions undertaken for an IoT application. This
    will be necessary in order to identify whether the application of patterns is
    effective over time (e.g., it does indeed prevent the occurrence of breaches of
    SPDI properties) and what might be the reasons for not being effective when this
    is the case. 7.6.7 Use Cases SEMIoTICS will target three IoT application scenarios:
    two verticals in the areas of energy and health care and one horizontal in the
    areas of intelligent sensing. These scenarios have been selected since they involve:
    (a) different and heterogeneous types of smart objects (i.e., sensors, smart devices,
    actuators) and software components; (b) different vertical and horizontal IoT
    platforms; and (c) different types of SPDI requirements. Due to these dimensions
    of variability, our scenarios provide comprehensive coverage of technical issues,
    which should be accounted for in developing the SEMIoTICS approach and infrastructure,
    and to this end provide an effective way for driving the R&D work programme of
    SEMIoTICS and evaluating and demonstrating its outcomes. 7.6.7.1 Renewable energy
    – Wind energy Current state of the art of Wind Turbine Controller in a Wind Park
    control network is typically an embedded or highly integrated operating system,
    which follows rigorously development and pre-qualification prior to deployment
    in the real world. As a result of this slow process, new features, adding new
    sensors, actuators and related advancements require several months or even years
    to be fully matured and operational in the field. Taking local action on sensing
    and analysing structured data to find the inclination of a steel tower – When
    the nacelle is turned during a cable untwisting event (Sensing), the gravity acceleration
    (Ag) component measured by an accelerometer in longitude direction (Ay) will vary
    as a function of the inclination (Inc) of the steel tower. O&M personnel in remote
    control center wants to know the inclination of all the steel towers on a number
    of specific wind farms, as these details will have to be shared with the customer
    to monitor the deformation and fatigue of the steel. To find the inclination of
    a steel tower, a full cable-untwist procedure has to be activated. This happens,
    depending on wind conditions, 3–4 times a month. It is also possible to manually
    instruct the wind turbine to perform the unwind procedure. At the time of the
    unwindingprocedure a hi-frequency set of data is recorded. A relatively large
    amount of data is required to calculate the inclination. This datasheet needs
    to be sent back to the remote control center to model and calculate the inclination.
    In SEMIoTICS, localized edge analytics will be applied which will result in semi-autonomous
    IIoT behavior as only the container containing the algorithm and result of the
    inclination calculation is transferred to between the wind turbine and the remote
    control centre. The unnecessary data traffic between each turbine and remote control
    centre is greatly reduced. Without the localized analytics functionality, all
    the hi-frequency acceleration and nacelle position data should have transferred
    to remote control centre resulting in suboptimal operation. Smart Actuation by
    sensing unstructured video/audio data – Within the turbine, there are many events
    which can be captured by IIoT sensors such as Grease leakage detection during
    normal operation or unintended noise detection when the turbine rotor is changing
    the direction in the line of wind to maximize energy production. The sensing of
    this unstructured data and acting locally to prevent any damage to the parts of
    the turbine in the long run will be of key importance. Localized analytics, as
    proposed in SEMIoTICS, which will lead in smart actuation to protect the critical
    infrastructure of renewable energy resources. SEMIoTICS implements: Industrial
    Things semantic discovery, Bootstrapping of IIoT devices and Gateway Inventory
    of the things at the SDN controller REST-based Intent interface for network-agnostic
    cloud applications Security at every layer Local data analytics at the Sensors,
    Actuators and Gateway 7.6.7.2 Healthcare This healthcare use case is an attempt
    to come up with usable, acceptable and sustainable IoT solution for assisted mobility
    through falls prevention leading to active and healthy ageing. Falls in older
    adults are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality and are an important
    class of preventable injuries. This use case specifically focuses on advanced
    fall prevention and management solution aimed at both senior citizens and adults
    with Mild Cognitive Impairment or mild Alzheimer’s disease and their (informal)
    caregivers. The objective of this scenario is to extend the existing IoT platform
    like AREAS with Assisted Mobility Module (AMM) which is a dedicated module for
    the management of, and integration of information from, a network of IT services
    and hardware devices constituting an advanced fall prevention and management solution
    aimed at both senior citizens and adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment or mild
    Alzheimer’s disease and their (informal) caregivers. Given the figures introduced
    at the beginning, the social dimension of the solution is reflected in the improved
    quality of life for people that are susceptible to falls, given that AMM will
    prolong the time they can work and live independently. The envisaged evolution
    of the AMM will see the inclusion of additional robotic elements, in particular,
    the system will include a: Robotic Assistant (RA) connected to a network of embedded
    IoT devices and services for monitoring (and maintaining a diary of) a patient’s
    activities, health status and treatment, as well as for supporting cognitive skills
    training, notifying/reminding the patient of upcoming treatments (e.g. medication
    schedules) and visits. Personal assistant robots may help the patients with their
    daily activities like walking trail and other routine. SEMIoTICS will contribute
    in the: Integration of distributed IoT devices with higher degree of autonomy
    (i.e. robotic devices) Exploitation of computational resources both in the cloud
    and at the edge Security and privacy of patient data, safety of a patient 7.6.7.3
    Generic IoT & smart sensing Today’s IoT embedded devices are often described as
    smart devices. “Smart” usually shall be associated to some Things that show some
    form of intelligence, bright behaviour during their operations. Unfortunately,
    current meaning and their reality is that they are locally programmable and always
    connected to some cloud infrastructure (e.g. typically through a wireless connection
    such as Wi-Fi or Bluetooth Low Energy) to send raw data. Therefore, these devices
    transmit sensed data to the cloud without any analytic being performed locally
    and without showing remarkable forms of computational intelligence. An IoT thing
    is intelligent is it has capabilities to learn from and act upon the data (at
    least without supervision) it is sensing. Sometimes, they also receive back from
    the cloud some form of actuation (control) instructions, which are determined
    by a centralized server-based analysis of sensed and other data. A typical example,
    on domotic applications, is the one where several sensing nodes stream some relevant
    raw data at given interval (e.g. temperature, humidity, pressure) to a cloud service.
    An example is the Microsoft Azure or IBM Bluemix cloud platforms and related ecosystem.
    In this scenario, the intelligent data processing always resides remotely, and
    the communication channel is (implicitly) assumed to be always present and open.
    The use case provides: Evolution of platform technologies enabling local analytics
    computing (i.e. edge computing) Enhanced IoT system scalability and increased
    robustness Open market enhanced middleware portfolio for intelligent embedded
    devices and innovative businesses opportunities SEMIoTICS’s research efforts focus
    in the: Support for tight integration at device level of sensing and computational
    elements in close tight cooperation on dedicated embedded HW (i.e. edge computing)
    Increased system scalability and computational partitioning to enhance system
    responsiveness and stability by exploiting self-adapting online learning mechanisms
    Enhanced architectural models redefining system from bottom to top for handling
    the continuous and discrete sensing. 7.6.8 Summary SEMIoTICS aims to develop an
    open IIoT/IoT framework, interoperating with existing IIoT/IoT platforms (e.g.
    FIWARE, MindSphere) and programmable networking, through their exposed APIs. The
    SEMIoTICS framework will also integrate IIoT and IoT sensing and actuating technologies.
    A core element of the SEMIoTICS approach is the development and use of patterns
    for orchestration of smart objects and IoT platform enablers in IoT applications
    with guaranteed SPDI properties. Patterns constitute an architectural concept
    well founded in software systems engineering. SEMIoTICS advocates the patterns
    approach to systems engineering, but uses a novel pattern type (i.e., SPDI patterns)
    to guarantee semantic interoperability, security, privacy and dependability in
    large scale IIoT/IoT applications integrating smart objects. Said patterns will
    be supported by mechanisms featuring integrated and predictive monitoring of smart
    objects of all layers of the IoT implementation stack in a scalable manner, as
    well as core mechanisms for multi-layered embedded intelligence, IoT application
    adaptation, learning and evolution, and end-to-end security, privacy, accountability,
    and user control. This approach will enable and guarantee secure and dependable
    actuation and semi-autonomic behaviour in IoT/IIoT applications, supporting cross-layer
    intelligent dynamic adaptation, including heterogeneous smart objects, networks
    and clouds. 7.7 SerIoT The Internet of Things or Internet of Everything envisages
    billions of physical things or objects (sensors and actuators) connected to the
    Internet via heterogeneous access networks. IoT is emerging as the breakthrough
    technology introducing the next wave of innovations, including revolutionary applications,
    significantly improving and optimizing our daily life. The IoT is capable to create
    a complex Network of Networks system through IP protocol and Mobile Network connectivity,
    allowing “things” to be read, controlled and managed at any time and at any place.
    This brings such technical issues as the lack of a shared infrastructure, lack
    of common standards, problems with the flexibility, scalability, adaptability,
    maintenance, and updating the IoT devices, etc. Especially important are security
    concerns, resulting from all of the listed technological aspects [77, 78]. In
    case of lack of the IoT related security standards and commonly accepted technological
    solutions, every vendor creates their own solutions. Moreover, the solutions currently
    used in IT systems are mostly unsuitable for direct application in IoT, e.g. authentication
    based on central server that works well for small scale systems but does not provide
    sufficient mechanisms for future large scale IoT ecosystems. On the other hand,
    attacks on the IoT platforms will have significant economic, energetic and physical
    security consequences, beyond the traditional Internet lack of security. 7.7.1
    SerIoT Vision and Objectives SerIoT aims to conduct research for the delivery
    of a secure, open, scalable and trusted IoT architecture. The solution will be
    implemented and tested as a complete, generic solution to create and manage large
    scale IoT environment operating across IoT platforms and paying attention on security
    problems. A decentralized approach, based on peer to peer, overlay communication
    is proposed [69]. SerIoT will optimize the security of IoT platforms in a cross-layered
    manner. The concept of Software Defined Networks (SDN) is used and SDN controllers
    are organized in hierarchical structure [74, 75]. The objectives of SerIoT include
    to provide the prototype implementation of a self-cognitive [66–68], SDN based
    core network, easily configurable to adapt to any IoT platform, including advanced
    analytics modules, self-cognitive honeypots and secure routers. The solution will
    be supported by appropriate technologies such as Decision Support System (DSS)
    supplementing controller’s functionality. The DSS will be able to detect the potential
    threats and abnormalities. The system will be supplemented with comprehensive
    and intuitive visual analytics and mitigation strategies that will be used according
    to the detected threats. It will be validated in the final phase of the project
    through representative use cases scenarios, involving heterogeneous EU wide SerIoT
    network system. 7.7.2 SerIoT Architecture Concept The SerIoT architecture [65]
    is based on a software-managed network implementing SDN technology and is divided
    into the following layers and modules (See Figure 7.13.). Figure 7.13 The structure
    of layered SerIoT architecture. The IoT Data Acquisition layer is comprised of
    the low-level IoT-enabled components that create the infrastructure backbone,
    including honeypots, dedicated engines and storage capabilities and the SDN secure
    routers. The SDN routers will use OpenFlow communication and will be based on
    Open Switch implementation being significantly extended to cooperate with related
    SerIoT modules and security mechanism. The backbone network will be divided into
    domains (subnets). Every subnet constitutes an autonomic SDN network, controlled
    by the SDN controller and extended according to SerIoT needs. Controllers will
    be organized into hierarchical structure [76]. The first level controller is responsible
    for the routing within the subnet using gathered data. It will be also able to
    route packets to neighbouring subnets (via the appropriate border node). In the
    case of destinations outside their own subnet and neighbouring subnets, routing
    requests will be sent to a second (or third, fourth, etc.) level controllers.
    The controllers will continuously gather information to feed the analytics module.
    These components will be connected to visual analytics module and support decision
    making system. The Ad-hoc Anomaly detection layer will provide a number of security
    mechanisms, executed across IoT devices, honeypots and SDN routers. Anomaly detection
    techniques based on local traffic characteristics (as dynamic changes in queue
    lengths) will be regularly probed by smart “cognitive packets” sent by the SDN
    controller and feeding the controller routing decisions. The controller will have
    the ability to detect suspicious and risky paths, and re-schedule the routing
    paths over secure, preferable connections according to secure aware routing, but
    also energy and Qality of Service (QoS) aware routing [71–73]. The Visual Analytics
    and Decision Support tools will deal with the interactive decision support applications
    that will be delivered to the end-users, able to effectively detect potential
    abnormalities at different levels of the network. The end-user tool will be developed
    together with a novel visual analytics framework, dealing with the effective management
    and visualization of data. The Mitigation and Counteraction Module will be responsible
    for implementing decisions taken by the Decision Support tools. The module will
    use dedicated software and network components as SDN routers, honeypots and IoT
    devices. The SerIoT platform will ensure the separation of enterprise and private
    data. The system will provide monitoring mechanisms and anomaly detection techniques,
    using a cross-layer data collection infrastructure that will allow effective information
    transmission and data aggregation for analysis. A prototype honeypot with the
    ability to analyse network traffic and detecting anomalies will be developed.
    This new architecture for ensuring security, based on SDN technology, should bring
    a significant progress in comparison to current solutions. The innovatory approach
    used in SerIoT network will be using Cognitive Packets [70] for gathering network
    data on QoS, security state and energy usage, and Cognitive Packet Network routing
    engine, based on Random Neural Networks (RNN) [79, 80]. The concept is a combination
    of neural-networks-based routing and source routing. It was successfully applied
    in SDN network [71], and in the SerIoT project will be extended both in terms
    of data used as input for routing engine and of scale of the networks. Security
    data will be used as input for learning of RNN, along with QoS and energy usage
    data, to allow finding secure and efficient routes for every SDN flow. 7.7.3 Use
    Cases The solutions of the SerIoT project will be evaluated in individual laboratory
    test-beds and also in an integrated EU wide test-bed which will interconnect significant
    use cases developed by SerIoT industry partners. SerIoT aims to design and to
    deploy four innovative use cases arising from three significant for the global
    economy domains where the use of IoT is rapidly increasing: (i) Smart Cities domain
    will be covered by two ambitious use cases where Surveillance and Intelligent
    Transportation IoT networks will be evaluated, (ii) Flexible Manufacturing domain
    with the detection of physical attacks on wireless sensor networks, and finally
    (iii) a novel Food Chain Scenario will be exploited demonstrating mobility security
    issues. Each of the use cases considers one or several scenarios. A scenario is
    intended to describe and specify the system behaviour according to a specific
    situation, or in other words to describe the situation in which a specific system
    should work and how the system works and interacts with the different users: Use
    Case 1 (Surveillance) scenarios: Facilities monitoring Embedded intelligence in
    buses Use Case 2 (Intelligent Transport Systems ITS in Smart Cities) scenarios:
    Automated driving Public transport maintenance Public transport security Road
    side ITS stations Use Case 3 (Flexible Manufacturing Systems) scenarios: Wireless
    robots in warehouse Critical infrastructure protection Use Case 4 (Food Chain)
    scenario: Fresh food deadline control 7.7.4 Industrial and Commercial Involvement
    SerIoT has strong support regarding industrial know-how and implementation. Among
    the Consortium partners there are eight industrial or small/medium size enterprises
    (SME) with diverse and complementary technological and research expertise, covering
    the full spectrum of research and innovation activities anticipated in the project
    [65]. Six of these partners are large industrial societies able to support the
    multi-disciplinary topics introduced in SerIoT, i.e. IoT telecom/network infrastructure
    & Industry 4.0 Use Cases by DT/T-Sys, IoT anomaly detection by ATOS, IoT applications
    & platform by DT/T-Sys., design-driven & cross-layer analytics by ATOS. Moreover,
    SMEs involved in the consortium are among the leading and innovative companies
    in their sectors. Hence, a large amount of innovation foreseen in the project
    will be also carried by SMEs. What all SerIoT SME partners share in common is
    their proven ability to apply research results into successful and well established
    commercial products (e.g. HOP Core, Wear & Extended innovative solution by HOPU).
    Having in mind their strong commitment in delivering new services in their customers,
    industrial & SME partners have identified complementary private investments to
    support the SerIoT business perspectives. Moreover, specific dissemination actions
    will be carried out, through already established communication channels, networks
    and working groups in order to ensure that the new & open solutions of the project
    will be conveyed to major stakeholders in Europe and Worldwide. 7.7.5 Summary
    In this paper we outline the EU H2020 SerIoT project that addresses IoT security
    challenges. As a scientific project, SerIoT will provide a new approach to understand
    the threats to IoT based infrastructures and deliver methods to solve the security
    problems in the IoT. Pioneering research and development based on holistic approaches
    will be conducted. A generic IoT framework based on an adaptation of the concept
    of Software Defined Networks with Cognitive Packets will be developed as well
    as the new methods for intrusion detection with the use of a cross-layer approach.
    Visual analytics tools for analysing threats in IoT ecosystem will be used. 7.8
    SOFIE – Secure Open Federation for Internet Everywhere The main goal of the SOFIE
    [83] project is to enable diversified applications from various application areas
    to utilise heterogeneous IoT platforms and autonomous things across technological,
    organisational and administrative borders in an open and secure manner, making
    reuse of existing infrastructure and data easy. SOFIE is guided by the needs of
    three pilot use cases with diverse business requirements: food supply-chain, mixed
    reality mobile gaming, and energy markets. Furthermore, we will explore the synergies
    among these areas, building a foundation for cross-application-area use of existing
    IoT platforms and data. SOFIE will design, implement and pilot a systematic, open
    and secure way to establish new business platforms that utilise existing IoT platforms
    and distributed ledgers. With “openness”, we mean flexible and administratively
    open business platforms, as well as technically decentralised federation to enable
    the interoperability of different IoT platforms, ledgers, and autonomous devices.
    To realise this vision, SOFIE brings together large system vendors and integrators
    (ENGINEERING and Ericsson), high tech SMEs delivering highly innovative products
    and solutions (GuardTime, Synelixis) and prestigious universities (Aalto University
    and the Athens University of Economics and Business). The results of the project
    will be guided by these three use cases and will be tested in an equal number
    of real-life trials. For this purpose, the consortium includes ASM TERNI S.p.A.,
    a public multi-utility company and Emotion who will trial SOFIE developments in
    the energy sector, OPTIMUM, a leading SME in the area of supply chain IT systems,
    which (together with SYNELIXIS) will trial SOFIE in the realisation of a farm-to-fork
    scenario and Rovio Entertainment Corporation, which will lead the SOFIE trial
    in a mixed reality mobile gaming context. 7.8.1 Objectives The SOFIE consortium
    has broken down the high-level goal into the following specific and tangible objectives:
    Define a secure, open, decentralised and scalable IoT federation architecture
    for sensing, actuation, and smart behaviour. In order to stay open and interoperable,
    emerging standard interfaces should be used between the components and towards
    the outside world. Make IoT data and actuation accessible across applications
    and platforms in a secure and controlled way. SOFIE must provide the means to
    reuse data, within the limits set by its owner, across applications. Develop a
    solution to provide integrity, confidentiality and auditability of IoT data, events
    and actions. SOFIE shall define and implement ledger-independent transactions
    that can be simultaneously entered into various closed and open blockchains and
    other persistent ledgers. Develop an IoT federation framework to facilitate creation
    of IoT business platforms. The framework can be used to create business platforms,
    including those for the three pilot use cases. Deploy and evaluate the SOFIE federation
    framework in three field trials. Evaluate the commercial viability of the SOFIE
    federation approach based on the three field trials and research on business models.
    Establish the SOFIE IoT federation approach as a major enabler for the IoT industry
    through dissemination, standardization, education, workshops and pilots. 7.8.2
    Technical Approach SOFIE combines several IoT platforms and distributed ledgers
    into a federated IoT platform supporting the reuse of existing IoT infrastructure
    and data by various applications and businesses. Figure 7.14 illustrates the overall
    architectural approach. Figure 7.14 SOFIE Secure and Open Federation Architecture.
    SOFIE achieves decentralization of business platforms through the use of DLTs.
    Since the properties of various DLTs, such as scalability, throughput, resilience,
    and openness, are significantly different, SOFIE relies on using multiple different
    DLTs in parallel. To allow transactions to be recorded into multiple blockchains
    or other ledgers, SOFIE will design and implement the inter-ledger transaction
    layer. We will build upon existing leading-edge work, including the W3C-associated
    Inter-ledger Protocol (ILP), applying the results to the IoT domain, and developing
    them further. The transactions will be implemented as multi-stage smart contracts
    whose resolution depends on the transactions being correctly recorded in all the
    participating ledgers, but without requiring that all the ledgers support smart
    contracts. The inter-ledger transaction layer will be used for three main purposes:
    Describe the (“things”) data in the existing IoT platforms, enabling financially
    tied IoT actuation between organisations and storing security-related data. Enable
    secure and traceable IoT actuation. The idea is to negotiate and use smart contracts
    that may span multiple ledgers to record intention or desire to actuate, to trigger
    actuation, to permanently record both actuation instances and the related sensor
    values, and to trigger any financial transactions, thereby supporting smart behaviour.
    Enable interoperability between diverse existing IoT platforms. This is achieved
    by augmenting the existing IoT platforms with a federation adapter. These together
    allow applications to: discover what data and things are available in the IoT
    platforms; acquire the necessary permissions for access (e.g. by promising to
    pay or placing a pledge); access the data and/or request actuation in a secure,
    recorded, and compensated manner; and verify whether the requested actuation took
    place or not. Beneath the inter-ledger transaction layer are distributed ledgers.
    These include commonly used blockchains such as Ethereum, and private commercial
    blockchains such as KSI Blockchain developed by SOFIE partner Guardtime [81].
    The SOFIE federation approach is designed to be technology-agnostic, allowing
    systems with different APIs and data formats to interoperate to the extent allowed
    by the applicable security policies. Some of the existing IoT platforms already
    support interoperability across different protocols and standards. Examples of
    this include FIWARE through its IoT adapters [84], such as the already existing
    LWM2M and oneM2M adapters, and W3C WoT, where the IoT servient concept supports
    both proprietary APIs and various protocol adapters. While most of the data will
    reside within existing IoT systems, a key aspect of SOFIE is the so-called smart
    contract, available in some blockchains, such as Ethereum. From the SOFIE point
    of view, a smart contract is simply a computer program and its associated computational
    state that “lives” in a blockchain. 7.8.3 Security Architecture The SOFIE security
    architecture provides end-to-end security (confidentiality and integrity), identification,
    authentication and authorization, and supports users’ privacy and control over
    their data. Most existing solutions already provide decent end-to-end security
    within the system and system-specific authentication. Therefore, SOFIE concentrates
    on innovating in the areas of data sovereignty, privacy and federated key management,
    authentication, and authorization. IoT data can often be personal and therefore
    governed by a new EU’s GDPR legislation. Ensuring compliance with the GDPR is
    a major design requirement for the SOFIE security architecture. SOFIE plans to
    use MyData [85] together with Sovrin Foundation identity blockchain [86] to allow
    individuals to better control how their personal data is used. In order to support
    data sovereignty and privacy, SOFIE adopts a three-level approach to the storage
    of data. First, there is a private data store managed entirely by the stakeholder.
    A private blockchain (such as Guardtime’s KSI Blockchain) forms the second level
    data that is shared between collaborating stakeholders (for examples producer,
    reseller, and supermarket in the food chain use case). Finally, some data (such
    as hashes of transaction trees from the lower level) will be stored in a public
    blockchain, such as Ethereum or Bitcoin. Such an approach allows fine grained
    control of the data, from total openness (e.g. to bring transparency to certain
    public services) to very tight access control (e.g. to protect trade secrets or
    the privacy of people). In either case, integrity and non-repudiation of the data
    is guaranteed. 7.8.4 Use Cases The SOFIE approach will be tested in three different
    use cases described below. The food chain pilot aspires to demonstrate the field-to-fork
    scenario towards security in food production and consumption. SOFIE applications
    and realization of a community-supported heterogeneous end-to-end agricultural
    food chain will be demonstrated and evaluated. The use case will combine multiple
    types of ground, micro-climate, soil, leaf and other information stations, existing
    IoT platforms, mobility, location-based services (LBS), food tracking information,
    smart micro-contracts, and decentralized autonomous organizations implemented
    with smart contracts. The consumer may trace the entire history of the product
    based on the QR or RFID tag on the package, even in the shop before buying the
    product. Consumers can reliably verify not only the farmer from whom the product
    originates, but also the entire production and supply chain history associated
    with each food item, starting from the source of the seeds, the quality of the
    soil and the air in the producer’s premises, the amount of water that has been
    consumed, the fertilization process, the method and time of growing, the weather
    conditions, the transportation mode and distance, the storage conditions etc.
    This gives consumers the ability to make decisions about their food based on health
    and ethical concerns, including environmental sustainability, fair labour practices,
    the use of fertilizers and pesticides, and other similar issues. In the Mixed
    Reality Mobile Gaming Pilot, virtual and real worlds will be combined. Mobile
    gaming is a rapidly growing market, popular games, such as Pokémon Go, are already
    taking advantage of augmented reality and SOFIE aims to take such interaction
    further. SOFIE will integrate a mobile game with the real world using a federated
    IoT platform aiming to: a) enable the gamers to interact with the real world via
    sensors and actuators, b) take advantage of existing and emerging IoT infrastructure
    (e.g. building automation), c) enable payments in virtual and real currencies
    between the gamers, games, and other parties, and d) create new business opportunities
    for various parties, including gaming companies, as well as the owners of buildings
    and public spaces (e.g. malls) and various businesses (e.g. shops and cafés).
    The gamers will be both moving in the physical world and interacting with it through
    the games. Existing IoT infrastructure, for instance movement sensors and control
    of lighting and passage, will be included in the game world through the federated
    SOFIE platform. Owners of spaces and businesses will be able to bring their existing
    or new IoT infrastructure into the gaming world, while the blockchain-based marketplace
    will allow for all kinds of business models, including In-Game Assets (IGA) trading.
    The energy pilot aims at optimized Demand Response and at supporting electricity
    marketplaces and micropayments. The energy pilot consists of two parts: first,
    a real-field pilot will demonstrate the capability of creating smart micro-contracts
    and micro-payments in a fully distributed energy marketplace, located in Terni,
    Italy. The pilot will cover the end-to-end scenario form electricity production,
    distribution, storage and consumption. During the scenario electricity produced
    by renewable sources (PVs) will be fed into the low voltage (LV) electricity network.
    Most of this electricity will be normally consumed by energy customers (i.e. houses,
    offices, etc). However, the surplus of the generated power would generate reverse
    power flows through the LV distribution network substation. The electricity distribution
    network is designed to handle only unidirectional electricity flows, thus reverse
    flows may generate significant problems. To avoid this abnormal operation, electrical
    vehicles (EVs) will be offered significant promotional benefits to match their
    EV charging needs with the network time and space balancing requirements. The
    EV chargers will be communicating with the EV drivers, with the car battery management
    system, the local energy generation and consumption, and the smart meters to predict
    if the requested charging service/network grid stabilization will be available
    in due time. Second, a laboratory and interoperability pilot based on real-data
    from smart energy meters deployed in the greater area of Tallinn, Estonia. The
    trial will be based on the Estfeed open software platform [87] for energy consumption
    monitoring and management from the customer (consumers/prosumers) side, which
    is capable of interacting with the power network and to provide data feeds for
    efficient use of energy. Figure 7.15 Three SOFIE pilots. To assess cross-SOFIE
    interoperability, SOFIE pilots will be federated as shown in Figure 7.15. In the
    cross-pilot, the emphasis will be on the demonstration of the exploitation of
    data stored/cached in different locations to be accessed across different platforms,
    as well as the development of applications exploiting different underlying infrastructures.
    The SOFIE interfaces abstraction will allow virtual entities in one platform to
    be exploited by applications from a different platform, while data semantics and
    analytics will facilitate the data exploitation. Initial consideration of scenarios
    to be tested include: Energy and gaming pilots exploiting data protection/privacy
    (e.g., for building access), energy pilots (EV) exploiting smart agriculture data
    with respect to environmental conditions and payments and contracts across pilots
    (e.g., getting food discounts from gaming achievements). 7.8.5 Conclusions The
    SOFIE federation approach will help make the existing siloed IoT platforms interoperable,
    enabling cross-platform applications and reuse of data in a secure and scalable
    manner. SOFIE will offer data sovereignty in GDPR-compliant way, giving users
    more control of their data. Through the usage of distributed ledgers, SOFIE will
    promote open business platforms, allowing creation of new kinds of decentralised
    open marketplaces, which no single entity – public or private – can technically
    control and thus exercise sole pricing power over them. This in turn will lower
    the barrier of entry for small businesses and individuals. The SOFIE federation
    framework will be released as open-source and SOFIE partners have the capacity
    to deliver and boost the penetration of SOFIE offerings in the market and relevant
    standardization bodies. List of Notations and Abbreviations Notations Abbreviations

    Spain Abstract This chapter describes the background and origin of the artistic
    series CREATE Your IoT. The series is a very special one as it is being created
    and hosted at the heart of the Large-Scale Pilots Programme of the European Union
    (LSPs). The series puts artworks at the core and makes them the motive for dialogue
    between all actual and potential stakeholders in use-cases of the LSPs aiming
    at pointing out ways of how other innovative actions can be implemented on top
    of the developments made available by LSPs. The text looks at how art and technology
    are intrinsically related, how art practices historically expanded their field
    of action to make the world and life a canvas and how more recently the influence
    of artistic ideas in the creation of new products, services and processes is irrevocable.
    More specific examples of this connection between technology and the arts in the
    field of ICT and IoT are presented. Finally, an updated report on ongoing artistic
    actions in the context of the CREATE IoT coordination and support action are presented.
    8.1 Introduction Technologies and the arts have always been closely related. Indeed,
    this relationship is invoked with every mention of the word technology, which
    has its origins in the Ancient Greek tékhnē, meaning art. In this project, we
    will explore the contemporary relationship between technology and the arts, reflecting
    on how they can influence each other and the conditions under which their synergies
    can flourish. New technologies have shaped artistic practices since the dawn of
    history. Demand for tools to accomplish specific tasks has compelled technology
    to develop in new directions. Potentially, the first tool one can conceive Homo
    erectus to have created, after winning the fight between the weight of their brain
    and gravity, was the invention of the stick – to more easily pick fruit from trees.
    The stick as an extension of the arm. The paint brush as an extension of the stick
    – an artistically driven technological innovation – is naturally conceivable as
    well. More recently, Andy Clark and David Chalmers conceived the iPhone as an
    extension of the mind [1]. Understanding Steve Jobs as the most contemporary artist
    of the past century then becomes key to pursuing the transformations of the timeless
    intertwining between technologies and the arts. “The ability to produce art was
    an indication that humans had begun to think in more abstract terms. It’s a thought
    process that enabled us to come up with the science and technology that enabled
    our species to become so successful.” —BBC article by Pallab Gosh, Oct. 2014 [2]
    This quote comes from BBC Science correspondent Pallab Gosh, who was reporting
    on recent discoveries in a rural area on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, where
    cave art from 40,000 years ago was found. The discoveries are the first of their
    kind outside the European continent, thus putting into question the positioning
    of Europe, and Western culture for that matter, as pioneering human development
    [3]. “The emergence of art marks the beginning of a surge in the development of
    human intelligence. The people who produce art are able to reflect their thoughts
    in the form of pictures and symbols”, reports Gosh. Indeed, the ability to transform
    “abstract knowledge” into “knowledge of perception” is a unique characteristic
    of human intelligence. This ability fulfils the human need for making sense of
    what happens/happened by creating narratives. There is also a need to freeze moments
    in time: the need for creating images one can grasp and hold on to, the need for
    making sense of life, the need for giving meaning to life – meaningfulness. The
    attribution of meaning to technologies is a relevant aspect for understanding
    the intertwining of technologies and the arts. For example, the invention of photography
    in the 19th century is possibly the event that had the most impact in the course
    of the history of art. On the one hand, it liberated painters from the duty of
    portraying personalities and started a movement of abstraction in painting that
    gave origin to great diversity of styles in the 20th century. On the other hand,
    it created a new tool for expression that is nowadays one of the most established
    forms of artistic expression. In sum, new meanings were attributed to the technique
    of painting and to a new technology – photography – which lead to new forms of
    images with its associated novel techniques. For instance, Pointillism can be
    interpreted as the first step towards a digital format of images, similar to what
    we nowadays call pixels. 8.2 CREATE Your IoT Artistic practices are thinking processes
    as well as they generate reproducible knowledge. The peculiarity of the knowledge
    generated by the arts using technology is that by reverse engineering the final
    products of those creations, one can fully understand its functionality. One of
    the characteristics of the practice of art is that artists act first and rationalize
    later. The actual context of the relationship between ICT and art allows for an
    unprecedented integration of subjectivity in the context of technological research.
    8.2.1 The Practice of Art as a Thinking Process Urgency is a condition sine qua
    non in the attribution of the artistic quality to a practice. For a practice to
    be considered as artistic, it has to originate in that primordial urgency. Karl
    Phillip Moritz (1756–1793), in his writings Artistic Imitation of the Beautiful,
    defined this urgency or artistic impetus as drive and not as idea, concept or
    a representation [4]. This reverses the Leibniz–Wolffian hierarchy of human faculties
    by valuing the artistic, by considering the irrational and subconscious as the
    true source of human agency. Philosophers such as Schopenhauer, Nietzsche and
    others support that culture initiated by Moritz in which the “dark and undefined”
    balances with and is as relevant as the “clear and distinct” [5]. According to
    Landgraf, Moritz sees urgency as being about the productivity of nature that serves
    as media. It links the artist and the artwork as well as driving the creative
    process. Artistic creativity allows for the mediation between an undefined non-representational
    stimulus, i.e. realisation, and the artistic objectification or communication
    of the stimulus, i.e. manifestation. Artistic is that which is created by an artistic
    practice, and that distinguishes it from any other knowledge generation practice,
    such as scientific practice. The core of artistic practice is the urgency for
    creation, composed of two poles: realisation and manifestation. They are the indivisible
    components of artistic urgency. Realisation is the need to make things happen
    while manifestation is the need to create beings. Realisation is the core of practice
    itself. It is the action of making. It is movement, the energy of exteriorization.
    It is embodying in an outward form. Manifestation is the core of creation. It
    is openness to revelation. It is recognising a being, the energy of interiorization.
    It is embodying in an inward form. The Portuguese poet, Helder, expresses an extraordinary
    image of Manifestation: I now dive and ascend as a glass. I bring up that image
    of internal water. Poem pen dissolved in the primordial direction of the poem.
    Or the poem going up the pen, passing through its own impulse, poem returning.
    Extract from Sumula (sum and substance), by Herberto Helder translated by Luis
    Miguel Girao (not published). Herberto Helder (1930–2015), in the excerpt above,
    describes the bipolar coexistence of Realisation and Manifestation with a special
    focus on the latter. He describes the inwards embodiment of the pen by a poem.
    The “primordial direction of the poem” is towards the pen and the poet himself.
    “The poem going up the pen, passing through its own impulse” represents the impulsive
    nature of the need of making of the poet, Realisation. By “passing through its
    own impulse”, the poem embodies the pen and reveals itself to the poem which,
    in turn, writes it on the paper. Manifestation nurtures Realisation, which in
    turn nurtures Manifestation, in a non-starting and non-ending cycle of urgency.
    Helder understands the artwork, the poem, as a being. The poem has its own life
    and manifests itself through the poet, the pen and the paper: “poem returning”.
    The return of the poem is the process of Manifestation that, however, is dependent
    on the poet’s need for objectification: Realisation, his need to make things happen,
    in order to materialise as a form. In a particular way, Helder expresses how “Nietzsche
    saw thinking itself: as a dance of concepts and the pen”, as pointed out by Roy
    Ascott (1934–) in Telematic Embrace [6], when describing telematic networks as
    a “planetary field for the dance of data”. Telematics, as envisioned by Ascott,
    allows for the disappearance of “senders” and “receivers”, so that they all become
    “users”, creative participants. He established the concept of “distributed authorship”
    in digital networks following up on the ideas of Barthes’ “dispersed authorship”
    in his Le Plaisir du Text [7] and Derrida’s free play of sense. Seconding the
    notion of thinking of culture as started by Moritz and followed by Nietzsche is
    Agostinho da Silva (1906–1994). In one episode of the TV series Conversas Vadias,
    broadcast by the Portuguese national broadcaster, RTP, between 8th March and 31st
    May 1990, the Portuguese philosopher stated: We could carry on our shoulders a
    machine that thinks, or rather a machine that detects ideas that roam around the
    world. —Agostinho da Silva, 1990. [1] [1] https://arquivos.rtp.pt/conteudos/conversa-com-baptista-bastos/
    from minute 22 onwards. (last accessed on 13/08/2017) Translated by Luis Miguel
    Girao. This statement by da Silva is not an affirmation, but rather a proclamation
    of doubt. It was made after the interviewer, the writer Armando Baptista-Bastos
    (1933–2017), asked Professor da Silva why he normally advised his students not
    to think. His answer was the above quoted proclamation of doubt. According to
    da Silva, “we still don’t know” whether we produce thoughts or whether thoughts
    come to our minds. In case of doubt, his choice was not to think. Da Silva, in
    a communicative way aimed at addressing the masses, pointed out, as Morris did,
    that ‘detecting ideas’ is also valid for the generation of knowledge. He was trying
    to bring to the general public a discussion that has been going on for centuries
    about noumena and phenomena. One of the high points of the discussion about noumena
    and phenomena is the critique by Arthur Schopenhauer (1788–1860) of Immanuel Kant’s
    (1724–1804) use of the word noumena: But it was just this distinction between
    abstract knowledge and knowledge of perception, entirely overlooked by Kant, which
    the ancient philosophers denoted by noumena and phenomena. (See Sextus Empiricus,
    Outlines of Pyrrhonism, Book I, Chapter 13, ‘What is thought (noumena) is opposed
    to what appears or is perceived (phenomena).’) This contrast and utter disproportion
    greatly occupied these philosophers in the philosophemes of the Eleatics, in Plato’s
    doctrine of the Ideas, in the dialectic of the Megarics, and later the scholastics
    in the dispute between nominalism and realism, whose seed, so late in developing,
    was already contained in the opposite mental tendencies of Plato and Aristotle.
    But Kant who, in an unwarrantable manner, entirely neglected the thing for the
    expression of which those words phenomena and noumena had already been taken,
    now takes possession of the words, as if they were still unclaimed, in order to
    denote by them his things-in-themselves and his phenomena” [8]. Schopenhauer again
    makes a clear distinction between “what is thought” and “what appears or is perceived”.
    This distinction has been fundamental to the discussion on the practice of art
    as a thinking process and its potential contributions for knowledge-generation
    systems [2]. It is relevant to understand and recognise the opposed concepts of
    noumena and phenomena in order to understand the uniqueness of the practice of
    art in making both concepts coexist simultaneously, as expressed above in the
    definition of artistic urgency. [2] Knowledge-generation systems refer to organisms
    that bring together contributions from different fields of study to research a
    specific subject. The overall vision is that the integration of the practice of
    art in these interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary or transdisciplinary groups
    of researchers is crucial for the development of research. www.starts.eu (last
    accessed on 14/08/2017). Robert Pepperell, author of Post Human Condition [9],
    has resumed the discussion on noumena and phenomena by proposing the concept of
    phenoumenon. The notion of phenoumenon as the basic assumption for understanding
    the practice of art as a thinking process that “includes (all) our thoughts about
    reality which are part of a continuous phenoumenon” [10]. The great contribution
    of the practice of art for the generation of knowledge is transforming noumena
    into phenomena through Realisation and Manifestation by being both simultaneously:
    a phenoumenon. In other words, art is simultaneously embodying inwards and outwards.
    This means transforming “abstract knowledge” into “knowledge of perception” by
    producing technology-based artworks whose reasoning can be reversed. That is,
    making things happen and creating beings. 8.2.2 Art is Life (Integration) “Art
    is Life, Life is Art” —Wolf Vostell (1932–1998) Vostell was a German painter and
    sculptor and is considered a pioneer of happening and Fluxus. Fluxus was an international
    and interdisciplinary group of artists that, in the late 1960s, produced performance
    “events”, happenings, including concrete poetry, visual art, urban planning, architecture,
    design, literature and publishing. Fluxus has sometimes been described as intermedia,
    a category into which composers such as Niblock fall. The ideas and practices
    of John Cage influenced Fluxus, especially his understanding of the work as a
    site of interaction between artist and audience [11]. For Vostell, a human’s physical
    action, the handling of things, was already considered art. What happens, the
    happening, is already art only if one wants it to be and one affirms it. Artworks
    no longer need an envelope or frame. Art steps out of its frame, normally the
    gallery, and melts immediately into the stream of life. The dilution of the boundaries
    between daily life and the places determined for art was one of the main objectives
    of the Fluxus movement. This was partially achieved, especially at the beginning
    of the movement. Yet, arguably, the institutionalisation of art has been unavoidable,
    and it naturally took advantage of this sort of movement to expand its area of
    action. Nonetheless, nowadays we can experience very interesting forms of art
    practice, such as street theatre, viral theatre, pop-rock bands and performances,
    and even some fashion industry-related events, happenings or products such as
    flashmobs, which somehow integrate art in daily life contexts. One of the most
    common Fluxus happenings is the hammering of a piano as symbol of the destruction
    of the institutionalisation of the arts. This thesis builds upon a further development
    of this act, which is the destruction of desktop or laptop computers, as a symbol
    of the institutionalization of digital technologies. It is also the expression
    of the idea that ubiquity, in the form of the Internet of Things, amongst others,
    could allow the spread of artistic ideas, works or concepts embedded in new technologies
    themselves. Such a movement would allow for a worldwide dissemination of artistic
    ideas impregnated in society and economy via technological innovation. This idea
    is further developed in artistic interventions in the European Commission STARTS
    Initiative and the Internet of Things Large-Scale Pilots. Those interventions
    are an expansion of some activities already happening in the field of arts and
    ubiquity. In that context, it has become common practice to organise workshops
    in which ideas to be congregated in public participation are developed. Contextualising
    digital practices within architectural spaces and exploring the opportunities
    of experiencing and perceiving domestic environments with the use of media and
    computing technologies have been used as methods for the design of reflexive and
    intimate interiors that provide informational, communicational, affective, emotional
    and supportive properties according to embedded sensorial interfaces and processing
    systems. To properly investigate these concepts, a fundamental criterion is magnified
    and dissected: dwelling, as an important ingredient in this relationship entails
    the magical power to merge physical environment with the psyche of inhabitants.
    For this reason, a number of views providing necessary conditions to include matters
    of affectivity, ubiquity and layering complexity of interior space have been highlighted
    [12]. Integrative art is the integration of artistic practice into daily life.
    The way it is envisaged in this chapter is through the technology described above.
    Nowadays, integrative art is not a common practice amongst artists in the sense
    that is envisaged here. However, some relevant examples are emerging. An example
    of artistic critical approach in IoT is the work of artist James Brindle who is
    trying to build his own self-driving car and published all the code developed
    in pursuit of the DIY self-driving car [3]. Brindle says: [3] https://github.com/stml/austeer
    “Self-driving cars bring together a bunch of really interesting technologies –
    such as machine vision and intelligence – with crucial social issues such as the
    atomization and changing nature of labour, the shift of power to corporate elites
    and Silicon Valley, and the quasi-religious faith in computation as the only framework
    for the production of truth-and hence, ethics and social justice.(…) The attempt
    to build my own car is a process of understanding how the dominant narratives
    of these technologies are produced, and could be changed.” 8.2.3 ICT and Art Golan
    Levin, one of the most prominent individuals of the emerging field of ICT and
    art, very clearly demonstrated how artistic projects presented ICT solutions well
    before they became known: Figure 8.1 Myron Krueger’s Video Place (1974), and the
    Sony EyeToy (2003). Figure 8.2 Michael Naimark & MIT ArchMac’s Aspen Movie Map
    (1978–1980), and Google Street View (2007–). Figure 8.3 Jeffrey Shaw’s Legible
    City (1988) and E-fitzone exercise equipment (2008). Figure 8.4 Art+Com’s Terravision
    (1996) and Google’s Google Earth (2001, 2005–). The artist and technologist states
    that he wrote his article New Media Artworks: Prequels to Everyday Life, [4] as
    consequence of the following: [4] http://www.flong.com/blog/2009/new-media-artworks-prequels-to-everyday-life/
    “I struggled to justify the value of new-media arts research to an audience of
    Silicon Valley business people; while simultaneously, some new-media artist friends
    of mine discovered that their work had been ‘appropriated’ by a large corporation.”
    This example reveals one of the most important gaps in the generation of new businesses
    models in global markets: the one existing between creativity and business. The
    US, moreover, is home of crucial players in the field, such as the most relevant
    academic publisher in the field, Leonardo, and SEAD, the network for Sciences,
    Engineering, Arts and Design. However, the European context nurtures the development
    of institutions such as Ars Electronica that distinguished Golan Levin with its
    Prix; the same institution also distinguished Linus Torvalds, considering the
    collective process that led to Linux as an artistic expression. It is this same
    European context that recognized the emergence of ICT & ART so as to allow for
    the worldwide establishment of STARTS, the European Commission initiative in Science,
    Technology and the Arts, as a recognized field of Research and Technological Development.
    A considerable number of organisations, institutions and programmes promoting
    activities linking ICT and art proliferate in the European Union. Some of these
    institutions are worldwide leaders such as Ars Electronica (AT), ZKM (DE) or IRCAM
    (FR), to name but a few. However, it is from small organisations and individuals
    that the most innovative projects or actions originate. As an example, the Finnish
    artistic/researcher Laura Beloff, who has been operating as an individual focused
    on the development of wearable technologies, has recently been appointed the Head
    of Section–Interaction Design and Computer Game Development at IT University in
    Copenhagen, Denmark. The Finnish Bioart Society that she founded and directs was
    one of the participants of a workshop on bioart, promoted by the FBI in California,
    USA. Laura is one of many artists that are becoming institutionally prominent
    not in the field of the arts but in the field of ICT. Small organisations seem
    in fact to be the strategic focus of promoters, as funding in the field is mostly
    directed more to groups of people than to individuals. Medialab-Prado (ES), Kitchen
    Budapest (HU), F.A.C.T. (GB), Pervasive Media (UK), iDAT (UK), iMAL (BE) and CIANT
    (CZ) seem to be good examples of organizations promoting more relevant activities.
    More and more ideas of collaboration, co-creation, shared knowledge and participation
    are present in their initiatives. The concept of lab, from OpenLab, to FabLab
    and Living Lab, has been instrumental in the diffusion of techniques of digital
    fabrication and physical prototyping, allowing everybody to go, learn and create.
    From pieces of 3D printing to lines of code for multimedia installations, activities
    linking ICT and art seem to follow a model of establishing an artistic context
    for creative participation, be it in the form of interactive installations or
    workshops to learn how to make or to create. It seems that we are moving from
    models of engaging the arts to illustrate and communicate science, such as the
    one implemented at CERN, to the ideas of living labs, such as the iMinds’ own
    iLab.o or Barcelona Laboratori Cultural, promoted by Josep Perelló, who was previously
    responsible for the Science Area on behalf of the University of Barcelona at Arts
    Santa Mònica centre in Barcelona (SP). There are already a considerable number
    of small and medium businesses developing around these activities, such as Libelium
    (ES). The concept of providing creative learning platforms as a new business model
    is actually expanding as a strategy. What started as an artistic project is becoming
    the standard for rapid prototyping in physical computing: Arduino (IT). This development
    platform created and has been maintaining a large community of developers around
    itself, based on the establishment of an easy-to-use programming language, a playful
    set of online tutorials and an active online form. The same model has been applied
    in Processing or openFrameworks. The community started with a majority of artists
    and expanded to become of a majority of technologists. Almost every electronics
    store in big European cities sells Arduino and related products. The expansion
    of this model is becoming visible in big companies such as Farnell and its community
    platform Element 14 or the DIGI. Also, in this last case, the new XBee project
    gallery is a result of the collaboration of Rob Faludi (US) with the electronics
    corporation. At the University of Cambridge’s Computer Laboratory (GB), what is
    becoming the next platform for development was created: The Raspberry Pi. In education,
    the most interesting model seems to be related to the concepts of ubiquity and
    the internet of things. i-DAT24 of the University of Plymouth (UK) has been promoting
    exemplary initiatives such as the Confluence Project: a group of students of schools
    located at North Devon’s UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, in collaboration with artists
    and technologists, developed and implemented remote wireless networks from which
    they created online data visualisations. In research, the most relevant worldwide
    network of researchers in the field of Art, Science, Technology and Consciousness
    Studies is the Planetary Collegium. The network has nodes in Lucerne, Trento and
    Shanghai. The main hub is at the University of Plymouth. A considerable number
    of conferences on the crossings of ICT and arts happen all over the world, the
    most relevant being, for example, ISEA, Ars Electronica, Siggraph, HCI International
    and Transmediale. At the level of social innovation, the growing intersection
    between the application of ICT and art in the field of disability is notable.
    The Artabilitation (DK) group has been joining a relevant number of researchers
    in this area, including the exemplary case of Rolf Gehlhaar. Gehlhaar developed
    a number of digital interfaces for musical expression, some of them recently integrated
    into the British Paraorchestra. The orchestra opened the Queen’s Christmas Speech
    of 2012 and played at the Paralympics closing ceremony in London, in 2012. The
    European Commission has been supporting a number of projects engaging the arts
    as described in the call for tender. However, the most relevant recent activities
    come from DG CONNECT which promoted the ICT ART CONNECT workshops and related
    events, which have been dedicated to better understanding how to integrate the
    arts with ICT. The COST Arts and Technologies Event took place in Zagreb, from
    the 25th to the 28th of November 2013. The COST Arts & Technologies (CAT) workshop
    assumes that there are large potential gains in integrating arts on the one hand
    with technologies on the other, to a larger extent than has been done so far.
    Combining artistic creativity with technological expertise should in itself have
    a great potential to lead to new products, services and social innovations. The
    workshop aimed at enabling innovative integration of arts and multi-, inter-,
    and transmedia technologies and their actual and potential integration with industries
    and society as a way of enhancing competitiveness and creativeness of European
    innovation in arts and technologies. [5] [5] http://www.cost.eu/events/cat The
    CAT workshop gave rise to a relevant collective white paper entitled Organisms
    for Change and Transformation. [6] [6] http://www.cost.eu/download/47808 DG CONNECT
    of the European Commission has been promoting key initiatives in the context of
    the Digital Single Market (DSM), under the umbrella of the STARTS Initiative.
    However, bearing in mind long-term targets such as 2050, it will be in the context
    of the now developing Framework Programme Horizon Europe of the European Commission
    that further development of STARTS will have to develop. In order to find conditions
    for the nurture of these future activities, areas of opportunity need to be found
    within this context. The present understanding seems that regional development
    will be instrumental. The reason behind this assumption is that the regions of
    Europe strategically dedicated to this area of innovative development will be
    determined to a large extent by this programme. The context of the Cultural and
    Creative Industries (CCIs) seems to be the ideal host for the ideas forthcoming
    from the potential research results from the future of STARTS. Nonetheless, it
    seems that the focus of this emerging field should probably not lie in the utilization
    of ICT for digital content, cultural industries and creativity. The utilization
    of the arts as a means to communicate aspects of science on its own also does
    not seem to be innovative enough for the purposes of the emerging field in question:
    this practice has emerged and spread worldwide, as these activities have been
    happening worldwide since the last century and are already quite established as
    described. The engagement of the arts with ICT are also instrumental in allowing
    the active participation of a large number of European citizens to create and
    live their own lives in a better way. Protocols such as Open Data and Open Source
    allow for digitally mediated forms of social innovation both at the level of opinion-making
    participation as well as at the level of self-employment. From this perspective,
    the creation and establishment of new business models and entrepreneurship becomes
    an active form of social innovation. This implies nurturing not only the visionary
    and exploratory characteristics of artistic practices, but also furthering their
    wider capability of research and development. These ideas are clearly aligned
    with actual objectives such as Inclusive Societies by which “The European cities
    have to be at the heart of policies aiming to create growth, jobs and a sustainable
    future” and “the increasing socio-economic importance of digital inclusion, research
    and large-scale innovation actions will promote inclusive ICT solutions and the
    effective acquisition of digital skills leading to the empowerment of citizens
    and a competitive workforce.” In her report on H2020, MEP Maria da Graça Carvalho
    proposes “education and science, arts and humanities as fundamental drivers of
    social and economic progress and well-being”. Social innovation generates new
    goods, services, processes and models that meet societal needs and create new
    social relationships. It is important to understand how social innovation and
    creativity may lead to change in existing structures and policies and how they
    can be encouraged and scaled up. Grass-roots online and distributed platforms
    networking citizens and allowing them to collaborate and co-create solutions based
    on an extended awareness of the social, cultural, political and environmental
    context can be a powerful tool to support the objectives of Europe 2020. Moreover,
    aspects of participation are also at the core of the programme: “…address social-network
    dynamics and crowd-sourcing and smart-sourcing for co-production of solutions
    addressing social problems, based on open data sets. They will help to manage
    complex decision-making, in particular the handling and analysis of huge quantities
    of data for collaborative policy modelling, simulation of decision-making, visualisation
    techniques, process modelling and participatory systems (…) as well as to analyse
    changing relationships between citizens and the public sector. Increased levels
    of complexity, the implications of questions posed by technology, advanced computation,
    life sciences and bio-engineering impinge upon areas of knowledge traditionally
    related with human studies, such as philosophy, theology, and legal, political
    and economic thought should be addressed. It is important to combine art, science
    and entrepreneurship; new forms of urban expression; knowledge, art and entrepreneurialism
    related to the integration of multiculturalism and integration of migratory flows;
    multilingualism.” The same applies for creativity and innovation: “Exploring processes
    which provide a favourable background to creativity and innovation. Providing
    a better understanding of the social, cultural, economic and political context
    for innovation shall be a priority. In particular, the role of youth perception
    of the opportunities for innovation in the current economic environment of high
    unemployment in many EU regions shall be carefully understood in relation to education
    and to the risk of brain-drain.” Finally, cultural heritage and European identity
    are also important: “The aim is to contribute to an understanding of Europe’s
    intellectual basis […] European collections, including digital ones, […] should
    be made accessible through new and innovative technologies and integrated information
    services to researchers and citizens to enable a look to the future through the
    archive of the past and to contribute to the European participative intelligence.”
    In sum, an understanding of the crossroads of science, technology and the arts
    on all these levels is crucial to fostering post-crisis processes of recovery
    in the European Union. At the heart of the Fourth Industrial Revolution lies the
    outstanding feature of the automation of mechanisation. Artificially intelligent
    computerised machines liberate humans from mechanistic tasks in chain with machines.
    The actual concept of a hybrid system integrates humans into industrial chains
    where subjectivity is a need. In this general context, disciplinary specialisation
    in research is giving way to transversal and holistic approaches, with the assurance
    that intelligent machines are in place to perform highly precise and effective
    tasks. Humans are no longer needed to perform complex operations but instead,
    they become indispensable to trigger and correlate highly complex operations,
    where knowledge convened by subjective processes is crucial for the achievement
    of results. Research and development practices are no longer methodological processes
    of confirming expectations or hypothesis, but now become flexible processes of
    discovery due to the availability of easier means of experimentation and repetition.
    Sciences of cognition set a very good example of that expressed above. They often
    cross knowledge from different disciplines, they depend on high-tech imaging and
    measuring equipment and their results are mostly dependent on subjective reports.
    Therefore, they demand an articulation of many different disciplines and their
    experiments are led by enquiry on subjective aspects of perception. Already in
    this field of research, the integration of artistic practices is an emerging factor.
    Art practices are transdisciplinary by nature, independently of the channels of
    expression used. Throughout history artists have specialised in developing technologies
    and implementing techniques in the design of artistic experiences. Therefore,
    in the present context of experimental integration of subjectivity, artists are
    emerging as relevant contributors in research and development of technology. Technologies
    being a consequence of scientific developments, artistic practices become interesting
    experimental methods for the generation of new knowledge. Strategies are needed
    for the integration of these new ways of thinking amongst different scientific
    communities, leading to true social and economic innovation. Historically narrowing
    our perspective over more recent events, one can say that the existing collaborations
    among artists and scientists are a consequence of the work of Frank Malina. He
    was at the origin of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratories, of which he was the first
    director. In 1968, in Paris, as a way of pursuing his interest in kinetic art,
    he founded the Leonardo Journal, which is still the leading publication on the
    crossings of arts, sciences and technologies. His son, Roger Malina, continuing
    his father’s work, is one of the most prominent agents in the field, by running
    the Leonardo project as well as triggering other actions such as SEAD. SEAD is
    looking into congregating best practices of collaborations in science, engineering,
    arts and design. However, all actions in the field tend to make the old-fashioned
    model prevail, where every single actor of the collaborative system conserves
    and develops his or her own speciality, which of course enhances political aspects
    of real and productive collaboration. Their results are mostly limited to theoretical
    papers, and in cases that could result in practical applications, issues of generating
    economic value such as intellectual property generation and protection are generally
    dismissed. Not to mention how far these practices stay from aspects of creation
    of new products, services, and of the business aspects of generating new jobs
    and self-employment. Nurturing the expansion of fields of action of each discipline
    and solving conflicts resulting from their overlapping of functions are the instruments
    to achieve transdisciplinary. However, the main question still remains: How to
    integrate arts and sciences in truly productive ways, both in the direction of
    the generation of new philosophical knowledge, as well as in the direction of
    the creation of new technology-based businesses, in order to make the European
    Union the world leader of emerging markets and creating future ones? The adoption
    of artistic practices such as research methodologies is instrumental for the integration
    of subjectivity in the production of scientific, reproducible knowledge, allowing
    for a holistic approach, not only to the emergence of future sciences, but also
    of future technologies, leading to close-to-market results, especially concerning
    the intersection of the arts and information and communication technologies. Therefore,
    the main benefits of STARTS are in its features of nurturing socio-economic innovation
    by mediation of digital information and communication technologies. By promoting
    the intersection of scientific and artistic practices, inevitably leading to new
    methodologies and processes of generating new knowledge, STARTS aims to transform
    the way research and development communities face their own research targets:
    at one stage, to make them more open to novelty, exploration mechanisms, creativity
    and imagination; at another, to make them focus on concrete research outputs,
    in the form of close-to-market prototyping. The main targets of STARTS should
    be to disperse the idea that blue-sky, thinking-based research can generate added
    value, not just because of its inherent novelty, but because this novelty, by
    being tracked at intermediate states of development, will lead to new scientific
    and technological developments. Innovation at the social level where scientists
    and artists interact will lead to both new knowledge and new technologies, in
    accordance with actual demands of society and markets. In other words, STARTS
    aims to benefit European research communities by merging scientific and artistic
    research and innovation (R&I) practices into producing new philosophical knowledge
    and new technologies, as well as making R&I practitioners aware that having both
    of the above combined might allow for the creation of new markets, based on new
    business models, new products and new services. At the time writing, STARTS has
    three dedicated projects running and a relevant intervention in the Large Scale
    Pilots Initiative. Vertigo is promoting the integration of artists in knowledge
    generation systems by attributing grants for artistic residencies in research
    projects. Wearsustain is promoting the creation of new artistic driven prototypes.
    The STARTS Prize attributes yearly two distinctions for technological innovation
    through the arts. CREATE-IoT, the coordination project of the Large-Scale Pilot
    projects (LSPs) of the EU, also integrates the arts. CREATE-IoT has a crucial
    role in STARTS by promoting the notion of co-creation based on artistic practices
    within the LSPs and by introduction of the Experience Readiness Level indicator.
    8.2.4 Next Things_Next Starts Between December 2017 and April 2018, in Gijon,
    Spain, the exhibition Next Things_Next Starts showed for the first time the results
    of the research and production residency programme called Next Things organised
    by LABoral Centro de Arte y Creación Industrial in conjunction with Telefónica
    R+D over a five-year period with the mission to forge new connections and collaborations
    between art, science, technology and society. Following an open call issued to
    artists and other creatives, the most innovative ideas and projects related with
    the Internet of Things were chosen. The award consisted of organizing and funding
    a six-month residency – two months at LABoral, in Gijon and four at Telefónica
    I+D, in Barcelona – to materialise their ideas and projects. The exhibition was
    centred on the critical role played by creativity and social involvement in processes
    of innovation. Along with scientific and technical know-how and learning, art
    is a catalyst that helps transform knowledge into objects or processes. The showcased
    projects presented the paths which are opened up when combining creative thinking
    with the possibilities of open technology. The five critical and innovative projects
    chosen for the programme rethink and open a debate on contemporary situations
    stemming from technological advances. Through the creative use of new technologies,
    these projects propose prototypes for new solutions and working spaces. The exhibition
    was a first for STARTS in learning from previous experiences on artistic residencies
    in research contexts. The artists awarded with the prize were: Laura Malinverni
    and Lilia Villafuerte; Lot Amorós, Cristina Navarro and Alexandre Oliver; Sam
    Kronick; María Castellanos and Alberto Valverde; Román Torre and Ángeles Angulo.
    Here we present only three of those works as they represent a useful spectrum
    as examples for the integration of artists in the context of the IoT European
    Large-Scale Pilots. Environmental Dress represents the tendency of artists to
    engage with global matters such as climate change. Furthermore, the project demonstrates
    the capability of artists to technically implement elaborate systems as well as
    reiterating the importance of open source code and hardware. Figure 8.5 Environmental
    Dress, by María Castellanos and Alberto Valverde. “We are surrounded by polluting
    agents and other factors that have a direct impact on our everyday lives, our
    mood and, ultimately, on our behaviour. Variations in noise, temperature, atmospheric
    pressure, ultraviolet radiation or amounts of carbon monoxide are some of the
    challenges we have to face on a daily basis. At the end of the day, they are agents
    that influence our temper and our behaviour with others. Environment Dress is
    a piece of smart clothing that uses a number of sensors to measure the aggressiveness
    of our surrounding environs, detecting environmental variables and alerting us
    to them. Our body’s natural sensors are unable to measure and anticipate factors
    such as an increase in ultraviolet radiation, dust or noise, and others. The interface
    geo-locates environmental analyses and allows users to register their mood through
    a smartphone app. In consequence, we can establish the relationship between both
    variables and determine whether an increase in ultraviolet radiation can make
    the person who wears the dress feel better or whether an increase in noise level
    can make him or her feel more uncomfortable in a certain place. Finally, all these
    data are shown on an emotional map, pinpointing the most pleasant and unpleasant
    areas in a city.” (Source: catalogue of NEXT THINGS_NEXT STARTS Exhibition, LABoral,
    Gijon, Spain). Flone is representative of the need of artists to make technology
    accessible. In a subject matter such drones, with profound implications on security
    and privacy, the exposure and dissemination of how drones’ function is crucial,
    from an artistic point of view. Figure 8.6 Flone, the flying phone by Lot Amorós,
    Cristina Navarro, Alexandre Oliver. “Flone, The Flying Phone, is a platform to
    make smartphones fly, involving an innovative drone which combines digital manufacturing,
    personal empowerment and the use of a smartphone to remotely control the device.
    Flone is a self-built, low-cost biodegradable drone, conceived as an open source
    digital design. Some of its design elements (shape, size, material, lack of screws)
    make it accessible and adaptable for many people to conquer air space. The use
    of open software and documentation and the simplicity of making it democratise
    the knowledge needed to manufacture a drone and claim air space as a common domain.
    Flone aims at opening up the range of applications of air social robotics. This
    multimedia drone, a mobile multipurpose machine, moves through the public air
    space thanks to various smartphone sensors (camera, microphone, GPS, accelerometers,
    gyroscopes) and actuators (LED flash and speaker) together with wireless connections
    (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and 4G). The members of this project have imparted workshops
    in countless schools, art centres and universities in several countries. Dozens
    of individuals have replicated this project worldwide and made a flone for themselves.”

    Thero reiterates the urgency of giving control to end users of the decision of
    being connected. Having the option to consciously connect or disconnect to the
    internet is nowadays extremely important mainly because a great number of people
    are not aware that they are constantly connected through their devices. Figure
    8.7 THERO by Román Torre and Ángeles Angulo. “As a concept, THERO wishes to raise
    our digital privacy to the status of a precious and sacred object. Accordingly,
    the object has been given a highly aesthetic treatment, with the geometry and
    clean lines of an idol or talisman endowed with a value beyond its material qualities:
    the value of freedom and the right to digital anonymity. THERO is presented as
    a heavy sculpture which contains a device that blocks and encrypts our digital
    communications by allowing the user to directly manipulate the object. By manually
    rotating its structure, THERO is capable of managing our digital contact with
    the outside space. The piece basically consists of a router to which we can wirelessly
    connect all our digital devices. It can be handled physically to offer various
    levels of privacy: blocking pages we do not want to visualise or which demand
    excessive attention from us, encrypting our communication by using the TOR network,
    completely blocking access to the network, cutting all communication with the
    outside in order to only browse locally. The piece opens up a space for reflection
    on our actions and their subsequent traces and significance in the net. THERO
    tries to lower the abstract barrier of the digital tool by means of a number of
    physical actions that make us more aware of our use of the Internet. The presence
    of THERO in our homes would give corporeity to the need for privacy in our digital
    interactions. In essence, THERO gives us the power to decide when we want and
    when we do not want to be visible.” (Source: catalogue of NEXT THINGS_NEXT STARTS
    Exhibition, LABoral, Gijon, Spain). The most important conclusion from the Next
    Things programme is the management of intellectual property in this type of context
    of collaboration of tech companies and artists: keep it all open source. 8.2.5
    Artists and the IoT European Large-Scale Projects In the CREATE-IoT project a
    methodology for integrating ICT and the arts – or better put: to include artistic
    practices in the ICT development cycle – was designed to be fully adaptable. Its
    implementation in the LSPs will result from specific combinations of its methods
    according to the specificities, not only of each one of the LSPs they will be
    tailored for, but of each of the particular LSPs’ use cases. The methodology is
    designed to be applied in the specific areas of innovation of the IoT LSPs initiative:
    food and farming, healthy aging, public mass events, self-driven vehicles and
    smart cities. The basic principles are implemented in the ICT framework through
    a sequence of actions that will be selected from the range of artistic related
    activities and their correlation with the ICT cycle. The actions of integration
    of artistic practices in the LSPs are being done mostly around their use cases.
    The reason for this option is to demonstrate that artistic practices are useful
    in connecting humans and technology, towards a human-centred approach to technology
    as an enabler of better lives in general. The methodology is developed around
    the development of artworks to trigger dialogue with the LSPs and raise some questions
    that might help improve their final solutions. The underlying idea is that the
    services provided by the LSPs can trigger socio-economic innovation if made available
    to SMEs and individuals. The first step was the integration of an artist in residency
    in the CREATE-IoT project. So Kanno, a Japanese artist proposed creating the The
    ideal showroom of IoT. The ideal showroom of IoT is a two-part composition, a
    participatory installation. It shows the possibility of sensing, recognising and
    determining the world through the perspective of objects. A living room full of
    IoT devices is set out to let visitors experience this shift: sensors and cameras
    are interweaved into a well-known environment. The second part is providing a
    new point of view to perceive a post-IoT age perspective onto things and technology.
    Figure 8.8 The ideal showroom of IoT. The installation is set up in two parts:
    The first is a living room with many small computers, cameras and sensors installed.
    Most of them are not obvious and are hidden. These systems try to capture information
    of the visitors. A robot in the room will welcome the visitors. It will introduce
    and explain the context of the work as well as trying to have a conversation with
    visitors. In second room, there’s a laboratory set up, with a desk and VR headset.
    Visitors will experience the living room now from different perspectives. When
    putting on the VR headset, the visitor will have the view from the hidden cameras
    or robot. Experiencing the same situation again through an object-related perspective
    should give the visitors a new perspective on IoT and personal robots. In this
    residency between CREATE-IoT and So Kanno, a new artistic work is being developed,
    challenging the fundamental issues of interest in the Internet of Things. CREATE-IoT
    provides access to the artist for key people, companies, concepts and technologies
    associated with Trust in the Internet of Things. Key elements will be made available
    to the artist regarding the development of a trusted environment for the development
    of IoT and comprehensive technical and non-technical solutions regarding privacy,
    security and trust issues. The development of the new artwork involves various
    levels of research and development. Existing IoT products are explored and researched
    and selected regarding the functions they include for the installation. Technology
    used for the project are IoT devices with hidden cameras, smart speaker systems,
    personal robots and VR technology. In the development of the art work, the consumer
    products will be manipulated and adjusted for the artistic purpose. The developed
    system will integrate the video stream of hidden IoT security cameras. The IoT
    devices and robot will be accessed and controlled through a VR headset experience.
    The second step is the development of model of artistically mediated co-creation
    process around an artwork. Towards the creation of exemplary case studies, the
    LSPs IoF2020, ACTIVAGE, SYNCHRONICITY are being developed in order to realise
    artistic-led co-creation hackathons as a support to some of the use cases of these
    pilots. The aim of these hackathons is to artistically enhance the context of
    those use cases and stimulate creativity of all participants. The concrete target
    is to better understand the role of artists in pushing for innovative approaches
    either in the technology in question or its applications. Impact on uptake, adoption
    and acceptance will also be observed, as well as the potential of new businesses
    built on top of the technologies made available by the LSPs under study. At the
    moment, the use cases that are being considered for action are part of IoF2020:
    Figure 8.9 Added-value weeding data. This use-case collects location-specific
    camera data to provide insights on the number of vegetables growing on the field,
    the plants’ growth status and best harvesting moment, weed prevalence, nutrient
    shortages and drought stress. From an artistic point of view, it is interesting
    to understand how agriculture is becoming less anthropocenic. Figure 8.10 City
    farming for leafy vegetables. IoT technology in city farming enables the production
    of high-quality vegetables in a predictable and reliable manner, unaffected by
    plant diseases, free from pesticides and independent of seasonal influences. From
    an artistic point of view, it is interesting to imagine better lives that could
    allow free-time to have contact with the vegetables we eat. Figure 8.11 Poultry
    chain management. The focus of this use case is mainly on the growth of poultry
    with respect to animal welfare. This starts with an adequate environment in which
    the birds feel comfortable, as well as good-quality feed and water. These are
    extremely important aspects from an artistic point of view. Some years ago, the
    artistic community started to be concerned with this type of challenges, especially
    after the film Baraka. An example of the possible impact of these actions in the
    IoF2020 would be to see in its open calls a focus on more human-centred technology
    based on the technologies made available by the project. That is one of the underlying
    principles of the choices use cases to work with. 8.2.6 CREATE Your IoT The present
    result of the work undertaken is a series of works entitled CREATE Your IoT. Drawing
    inspirations from the title of the coordination and support action to the LSPs,
    CREATE-IoT, the series aims at expanding it by pointing out ways of how other
    innovative actions can be implemented on top of the developments made available
    by LSPs. It emphasizes the co-creative aspect of the all LSPs but in an alternative
    sense than that of citizen participation as promoted by the U4IoT CSA. In the
    series, artworks are the core and are motive for dialogue between all actual and
    potential stakeholders in use-cases. The CREATE Your IoT Series is at the moment
    composed of two artworks under development. The Connected Hennery and The Migrant
    Home. The artworks are being designed to allow the integration of multiple technologies
    made available by the LSPs. For example, The Migrant Home could host technologies
    from all LSPs MONICA, AUTOPILOT, IoF2020, ACTIVAGE, SYNCHRONICITY. The Connected
    Hennery is a reflection about the use case of the Poultry chain management of
    IoF2020. Inspired by the motto of that use case to respect animal welfare, the
    artwork starts by giving the chicken the control of the location of their home.
    It follows recent tendencies of permaculture, within which mobile henneries are
    substitutes for tractors in the cleaning of agricultural land. In permaculture,
    chicken inhabiting a defined piece of land clean it and fertilize it. Farmers,
    by simply moving the hennery around their land, make it ready for cultivation.
    The digital system of The Connected Hennery analyses the position and movement
    of chicken inside the hennery and predicts in which direction they would like
    to progress next, freeing the farmer from that work task. Furthermore, other sensors
    implemented in the hennery allow easier monitoring for the farmer in order to
    simplify and more effectively manage her/his intervention in the maintenance of
    the hennery. The CREATE Your IoT Series is looking at decentralized models of
    production of chicken and at its potential as added value for the associated use
    cases of the LSPs. Food suppliers are looking at how consumers are more and more
    interested in biological and organic products and how can they adapt to keep their
    leadership of the supply markets. This leads these suppliers to create their own
    production experiments in order to better understand how to create new products
    the fit customers’ demands. It is for this sort of context that works such The
    Connected Hennery are being developed in order to promote the LSPs towards end
    users. The Migrant Home is still in the early phases of concept development. At
    this stage it is looking at how an IoT mobile house can be transformed into a
    home for migrants for short-term jobs/enterprises connected with urban and rural
    niche developments, for instance recovery of rural and urban cultural heritage.
    Preliminary experience of the development of the CREATE Your IoT Series reveals
    that Open Standards and Architectures in the LSPs are crucial to make the technologies
    developed accessible and allow for the development of new business models. 8.3
    Conclusion The actual context of the relationship between ICT and art allows for
    an unprecedented integration of subjectivity in the context of technological research.
    The integration of subjective approaches is fundamental in making human-centred
    technological innovation. Human-centred technological applications fill in the
    gap between what is possible from a pure technological point of view and what
    people can encounter as useful in their daily lives to make those lives better.
    The LSPs represent a unique opportunity for the spread of creative approaches
    to technological solutions and those approaches can help to potentiate the results
    of the LSPs in terms of new applications and associated business models. It is
    this reciprocal relationship that will allow on one side for an expansion of the
    field of action of the LSPs and on the other for the LSPs of potential fields
    for innovation to be informed. The instruments of those actions are the co-creation
    hackathons. They will develop around the artworks of the CREATE Your IoT Series
    to trigger new solutions based on the technologies made available by the LSPs.

    security 1. Introduction Using 20% of the arable land and 10% of the water resources,
    irrigated agriculture produces 40% of the global food, which is important for
    ensuring food security and achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development
    Goals (Song et al., 2022; The World Bank, 2020; Xu et al., 2020). Under the influence
    of extreme climate change, population growth, and arable land expansion, rational
    and precise irrigation management has become important for achieving sustainable
    irrigation (Mekonnen and Hoekstra, 2016, Singh, 2014). Irrigated agriculture has
    led to severe water shortages both regionally and globally due to the expansion
    of irrigated areas and the increase in irrigation water use, and the continued
    depletion of irrigation water threatens the sustainability of irrigated agriculture
    (He et al., 2020b, Zhang et al., 2021a). The key coping strategies adopted by
    some European and American countries include changes in crop cropping patterns
    and improved irrigation technologies to increase the productivity of agricultural
    systems (Chen et al., 2021, Revoyron et al., 2022, Tribouillois et al., 2022).
    Middle Eastern countries are shifting crop patterns to low-water-demand crops
    to improve agricultural water use efficiency (Shtull-Trauring and Bernstein, 2018;
    Mikhak et al., 2022). African countries are taking steps to improve groundwater
    mineralisation to remedy the shortage of water for irrigation (Besser et al.,
    2021). During rapid economic development over the past two decades, the expanding
    production scale of Chinese agriculture has consumed large amounts of water. As
    water scarcity and competition among different water users (agriculture, industry,
    and households) continues to increase, China’s growing freshwater demand must
    be reconciled with already overused renewable water resources (Huang et al., 2020,
    Wang et al., 2019). Further, if irrigation occurs in arid areas where water resources
    are extremely scarce, this will exacerbate water shortages, making it more difficult
    to coordinate future irrigated agriculture with water sustainability (Li and Wang,
    2021b; Li et al., 2021c). Sustainable irrigation refers to irrigation practices
    that do not exceed the availability of local renewable water and freshwater reserves
    and can show sustainability regarding irrigation water volume (Rosa et al., 2019,
    Rosa, 2022). Cropping pattern optimization is an important approach for sustainable
    irrigation practices (Akpoti et al., 2019, Yin et al., 2022). Extensive research
    has been conducted on the optimization of cropping patterns to increase yield
    and reduce irrigation water in agricultural production. These optimization methods
    include, among others, crop suitability evaluation models based on combined subjective
    and objective weights (He et al., 2022); cellular automata model with coupled
    partial least squares (PLS) regression (Liu et al., 2022b); determining agro-climatic
    zoning and crop suitability planning with fuzzy inference (Nabati et al., 2020);
    constructing suitability functions to evaluate the suitability of arable land
    (Yao et al., 2020), and establishing the relationship between crop suitability
    and yield using the crop growth model EcoCrop (Manners et al., 2020), etc. As
    an important basis for cropping patterns (Manners et al., 2020, Rising and Devineni,
    2020), crop suitability qualitatively and quantitatively reflects the process
    of crop planting and growth that matches the required natural resources (light,
    temperature, water, soil, etc.) (Fan et al., 2021). However, most of these methods
    use empirical values to delineate crop suitability and cannot accurately assess
    the influence of the natural environment (climate, soil, topography, etc.) on
    the suitability of crop planting. The ecological maximum entropy (MaxEnt) model
    is the most widely used machine learning model for predicting species distribution
    (Phillips et al., 2006) and has recently been extended to crop planting suitability
    studies recently (Wang et al., 2021, Yu et al., 2022). This model realizes a dynamic
    simulation of the potential distribution of crop suitability based on environmental
    factors (Phillips and Dudík, 2008). It accurately quantifies the complexity and
    uncertainty of environmental factors on crop growth (Merow et al., 2013), which
    provides a high predictive accuracy of crop spatial distribution for the determination
    of agricultural irrigation water resources (Ashraf et al., 2017, Feng et al.,
    2021). Assessing the sustainability of irrigation water use has also been widely
    recognized for a long time, as it is extremely important to establish climate
    change-adapted irrigation schemes and manage irrigation water resources (Radmehr
    et al., 2022). Current studies have assessed sustainable irrigation through various
    approaches, such as multi-cropping systems and precision irrigation (Brar et al.,
    2022), deficit irrigation (Pardo et al., 2022) and water–energy–food optimization
    models for sustainable development (de Vito et al., 2017, Yue et al., 2021). Generally,
    the single-dimensional evaluation of irrigation water sustainability is insufficient
    and requires a comprehensive assessment of long-term irrigation water management
    (Davidson et al., 2019). The multidimensional elevation indicator–sustainability
    index (SI) of water resources has been used to assess water resources and sustainable
    agricultural irrigation because of its ability to comprehensively integrates reliability,
    resilience, and vulnerability of the indicators in technology assessment systems
    (Loucks, 1997, Sandoval-Solis et al., 2011, Srdjevic and Srdjevic, 2017, Li et
    al., 2020). The SI of water resources provides a mechanism for assessing and comparing
    the sustainability of irrigation water use (de O. Vieira and Sandoval-Solis, 2018).
    The analysis and summary of irrigation water sustainability can help manage future
    irrigation water resources and contribute to the achievement of sustainable irrigation.
    The Hexi Corridor in northwestern China is an area experiencing growing conflict
    between irrigation water use and irrigation sustainability (Fu et al., 2019).
    In this study, the SI was used to assess the potential of cropping patterns before
    and after optimization to improve irrigation sustainability in this region over
    the past 60 years and the next 20 years. The optimal cropping pattern was simulated
    using the MaxEnt model based on crop suitability of the current cropping pattern
    determined by field investigations. The aims of this study are to (1) find the
    optimal cropping pattern of crops that matches natural resources, (2) determine
    whether the optimal cropping pattern in goal (1) can improve regional irrigation
    sustainability, and (3) based on goal (2), explore the development potential of
    future regional sustainable irrigation. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Research
    framework To explore the sustainability of irrigation at the spatial and temporal
    scales, we developed a research framework as shown (Fig. 1). Firstly, we obtained
    multi-year crop planting locations for six crops (maize, wheat, potatoes, rape,
    cotton, and alfalfa) according to field samples. Secondly, we removed environmental
    factors that duplicated crop distribution influences through the correlation analysis
    of climatic, topographic, and soil factors for each crop. The MaxEnt model was
    then used to predict the suitability distribution for each crop. Next, the optimal
    cropping pattern was determined by screening for crops with the greatest suitability
    for each grid. The distribution of irrigation water was calculated using the water
    balance and Penman-Monteith equations (Allen et al., 1998). Finally, the SI index
    was used to assess irrigation water use over the past 60 years, and the CA-Markov
    model was used to obtain the spatio-temporal variation of the irrigation water
    SI over the next 20 years. Download : Download high-res image (459KB) Download

    situated in the northwestern Gansu Province, China (92°12''−104°20''E, 37°17''−42°48''N)
    is long (approximately 1000 km) and narrow (Fig. 2) (Yang et al., 2011). The region
    is typically arid, with an average annual precipitation of 50–150 mm and an average
    annual evaporation of 1500–2500 mm (Li et al., 2016). Irrigation water accounts
    for more than 90% of the total water consumption, but the GDP contribution of
    agriculture is less than 30%. Improving water efficiency is an important initiative
    for the sustainable socioeconomic development of the region (Huang et al., 2022).
    Due to these factors, balancing water scarcity and securing agricultural production
    is of regional concern. Download : Download high-res image (743KB) Download :

    main rivers, (b) elevation and meteorological stations. The oasis in the Hexi
    Corridor is flat and suitable for farming. Long-term irrigation and water-saving
    measures have indirectly exacerbated the warm and humid trend in the region, and
    the soil pore structure and physicochemical properties have been enhanced by years
    of irrigation (Fu et al., 2022, Zhang et al., 2017, Zhang et al., 2017b). However,
    the region has become the most important grain-producing area in northwest China
    and the core of the development of the Silk Road Economic Belt, relying on abundant
    solar and thermal resources and the only oasis, supplied by three inland rivers
    basins (the Shiyang, Heihe and Shule Rivers running through it from east to west)
    (Sun et al., 2021). 2.3. Data Daily meteorological data were collected (http://data.cma.cn)
    (Fig. 2), including precipitation, maximum, minimum, and average near-surface
    air temperatures, sunshine hours, relative humidity, and wind speed for 53 stations
    during 1961–2020. Topographic data were obtained from the national Digital Elevation
    Model (DEM) (https://www.resdc.cn) with 1 km resolution, and the slope was obtained
    from the DEM using ArcGIS software. Soil data were obtained from the China soil
    map based Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD) (v1.1) (2009) (Fischer et al.,
    2008, Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), International
    Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, 2009) and the soil moisture in the China
    dataset (2002–2018) (Mao, 2021, Meng et al., 2021) (http://data.tpdc.ac.cn). Because
    no one interpolation method seems to be universally optimal (Munyati and Sinthumule,
    2021), we combined both ordinary kriging (OK) and inverse distance weights (IDW)
    to interpolate the meteorological data. Kriging is the most commonly used interpolation
    method (van Groenigen, 2000), while IDW sometimes performs better than kriging
    because of the different natures of the variables, but both can be applied to
    interpolate the meteorological station data into gridded data (Gotway et al.,
    1996, Gong et al., 2014). All gridded data were processed at a resolution of 1 km × 1 km.
    2.4. MaxEnt model 2.4.1. Crop location sampling According to the Gansu Provincial
    Statistical Yearbook (2010–2021) (http://tjj.gansu.gov.cn), spring maize, spring
    wheat, potatoes, spring rape, cotton and alfalfa account for approximately 85%
    of the crops planted in the Hexi Corridor. Vegetables were excluded because of
    the wide variety of planting species, the small planting area of a single type,
    and the high spatial discretization. We obtained farmland planting information
    samples over the past decade through field surveys with handheld GPS locators
    and farmers questionnaires. To prevent crop point locations from overfitting the
    simulation results in the MaxEnt model, we conducted a spatially explicit correlation
    and ecological niche overlap analysis by screening crop point locations with a
    2.5′ grid size using ENMtools (Holt et al., 2018, Johnson et al., 2017). Finally,
    we obtained a total of 5137 effective crop distribution samples, of which samples
    number for spring maize, spring wheat, potato, spring rape, cotton and alfalfa
    accounted for 1561, 481, 667, 562, 824, and 1042 of the samples, respectively
    (Fig. S1 in Supplementary Material). 2.4.2. Environmental variables Meteorological,
    topographical, and soil factors that affect crop planting and growth are collectively
    referred to as natural environmental variables (Yang et al., 2022). Although crops
    differ in biophysical properties across regions, the main constraints (precipitation,
    temperature, soil characteristics, etc.) affecting crop distribution are broadly
    the same (Kogo et al., 2019, Peterson and Westfall, 2004). Therefore, we selected
    precipitation (Pre), cumulative temperature (Tem), relative humidity (RHU), sunshine
    hours (SSD), and wind speed (Win) as the meteorological indicators and used the
    average meteorological data every 10 years as a chronological change. Elevation
    and slope, assumed to remain static during the study period, were used to reflect
    the topographic characteristics of the cultivated land. To reflect soil characteristics,
    we chose soil texture (Tex), bulk density (BD), soil organic matter (SOM), pH,
    total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), total potassium (TK) and soil water
    content (SWC). Except for soil water content, we defaulted to other soil indicators
    that remained unchanged during the study period. To avoid collinearity among the
    selected indicators (Pearson et al., 2010), we used the Pearson correlation coefficient
    method to eliminate the RHU with a correlation exceeding 0.9 (calculated in SPPS
    24.0, results shown in Fig. S2), and retained the remaining 14 indicators involved
    in the prediction of the optimal cropping pattern. 2.4.3. Optimal cropping pattern
    simulation The MaxEnt model is a complex machine learning method based on maximum
    entropy theory, which can be run with data on species distribution points and
    environmental variables (Phillips et al., 2006). Based on a machine-learning approach,
    the model establishes relationships between sample points and environmental variables
    (Jaynes, 1957, Elith et al., 2011), which can better describe the nonlinear relationships
    between inputs and predictions (Heumann et al., 2011). The model builds an accurate
    probabilistic model of crop distribution by learning the relationship between
    the sample and environmental variables and determining the optimal distribution
    with maximum entropy in the approximate satisfaction condition (Jiménez-Valverde
    et al., 2011). Suitable distribution areas predicted by the model based on available
    crop point data represent areas with similar environmental conditions (Peterson
    et al., 2007). Considering that the arable land in the study area was less developed
    30 years ago, the current arable range (2020) was used to better reflect the influence
    of environmental variables on the distribution of crop suitability. Taking the
    crop distribution points as sample points and the selected environmental variables
    as constraints of the model, we explored the possible distributions of maximum
    entropy under these constraints. The optimal distribution of maximum entropy was
    used as the crop suitability distribution. In this study, the general interpretation
    of the maximum entropy algorithm is as follows: when the output of x is y, for
    a given training data set and feature function , the calculation process is as
    follows: (1) (2) (3) where is the conditional entropy, is the distribution assumption
    of the conditional probability, is the empirical distribution, and is the expectation
    value of the characteristic function on the empirical distribution. To obtain
    the suitability distribution for each crop at 1 km resolution, a random sample
    of 75% of the crop distribution points was used as data for the model training
    set, and the remaining 25% was used as the test set (Guisan and Thuiller, 2005).
    The test set was extracted using cross-validation to enhance the confidence of
    the simulation results (Phillips and Dudík, 2008). Five replicates were conducted
    for each crop, of which the final results were the average. The contribution and
    ranked importance of each environmental variable were then quantified using the
    jackknife method, and corresponding curves for all environmental variables were
    created. The other parameters of the model were set to their default values. A
    receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to assess the accuracy
    of the obtained crop suitability areas in the MaxEnt model. This was generated
    by plotting the false-positive rate of a model prediction (1-specificity, given
    here as fractional predicted area) against the true-positive rate (model sensitivity,
    given as 1-rate of false negatives). The performance of the model was measured
    by the area under the ROC curve (AUC) (Peterson et al., 2008), which ranged from
    0 to 1. The higher the AUC value, the more accurate the model predictions. The
    specific assessment criteria were: fail (0.5–0.6), poor (0.6–0.7), fair (0.7–0.8),
    good (0.8–0.9), and excellent (0.9–1.0) (Swets, 1988). The suitability of the
    six crops during the six decades from 1961 to 2020 was obtained using the MaxEnt
    model. The distribution probabilities of these crops in the same grid were compared.
    The crop with the highest crop suitability was selected as the most suitable crop
    in the grid to form the spatial distribution of the optimal cropping pattern over
    the years. 2.5. Computation of the SI In this study, the water supply transmission
    and distribution losses in the form of surface evaporation and canal seepage were
    not considered. Instead, water transported to the farm and consumed in the form
    of evapotranspiration from the field crops was calculated directly. The regional
    irrigation water demand of crops is calculated using the water balance equation
    (formula (6)), the Penman-Monteith equation (Allen et al., 1998) (formula (4)),
    and the single crop coefficient method (formula (5)). (4) (5) (6) where (mm) is
    the reference crop evapotranspiration; [MJ/(m2·day)] is the crop surface net radiation;
    G is the soil heat flux [MJ/(m2·day)]; (kPa/℃) is the psychrometric constant;
    T (℃) is mean temperature; (m/s) is the average daily wind speed at 2 m height;
    (kPa) is the saturation vapor pressure; (kPa) is the actual vapor pressure; (kPa/℃)
    is the slope of the saturation vapor sure curve; (mm) is the actual crop water
    consumption; is crop stress coefficient, which is calculated by NDVI (He et al.,
    2018); the crop coefficient ( ) could refers to Zou et al. (2018); the calculation
    of effective precipitation ( ) refers to Liu et al. (2022a). The SI is a composite
    index that measures the sustainability of water resource systems (Sandoval-Solis
    et al., 2011) and is used in this study to assess the sustainability of irrigation
    water with three indices: reliability, resilience, and vulnerability. Before calculating,
    we defined the state of each grid in the optimal cropping pattern from the deficit
    ( ) (Loucks, 1997), and the irrigation water state of the crop for the i-th grid
    at time period t can be described as: (7) where is the irrigation water amount
    required by the crop; is the irrigation water requirement of the crops under different
    optimal cropping patterns at other time periods. These two values can be calculated
    in formula (6) based on the interannual cropping pattern. Reliability is the probability
    that a system is satisfactory (Hashimoto et al., 1982). Here, the probability
    is that the irrigation water for the crops in the grid will be satisfied within
    60 years. Reliability values ranged from 0 to 1. When the reliability is lower,
    the frequency of irrigation water deficit is higher; if the reliability value
    is 0, the area is in a continuous water deficit; the higher the reliability, the
    lower the frequency of water deficit; and when the reliability is equal to 1,
    the area is temporarily free from water deficit. For a given time step (every
    10 years), the reliability of the i-th location based on the frequency of no irrigation
    water deficit is calculated as: (8) where indicates the number of times occurs;
    if , ; if , ; indicates a satisfactory state and indicates a failed state. Resilience
    is the rate at which a system can recover from failure and is a measure of the
    system''s ability to adapt to changing conditions (Lane et al., 2015). Resilience
    values ranged from 0 to 1. The lower the value, the lower the ability of the area
    to recover and the longer the water shortage experience. When the resilience value
    is high, the area is better able to recover from water shortages and less likely
    to experience persistent water shortages. If the reliability is 0, the resilience
    is also 0, indicating that the area is in persistent water shortage. If the reliability
    is 1, the resilience is also 1, and the area has no persistent water shortage
    or no water shortage. Similarly, based on the persistence of no shortage of irrigation
    water, the resilience of the i-th location is: (9) where indicates the transition
    from satisfactory state to failure state, if and , ; otherwise . Vulnerability
    describes the severity of damage to the system; that is, the average severity
    of damage caused by irrigation water deficits (Kjeldsen and Rosbjerg, 2004). Vulnerability
    values ranged from 0 to 1. When the vulnerability value is low, there is a slight
    shortage of irrigation water in the area, and a vulnerability value of 0 indicates
    that there is no shortage. A higher value indicates a more severe water deficit,
    and a vulnerability of 1 indicates that the area can hardly be met. Based on the
    shortage of water and the total unmet water demand, the vulnerability of the i-th
    location is: (10) The geometric mean method was used to calculate the SI (Sandoval-Solis
    et al., 2011), which ranged from 0 to 1. Higher values indicate higher sustainability
    of irrigation water, indicating the area has the potential for sustainable irrigation.
    Lower values indicate lower sustainability, indicating the area has less potential.
    When the SI is 0, reliability or resilience is 0, and vulnerability is 1, indicating
    that the area has a continuous shortage of irrigation water resulting in limited
    crop production. when the SI is 1, reliability and resilience are 1, and vulnerability
    is 0, indicating that the area has sufficient irrigation water to meet crop production.
    For a given number of time steps, the SI at position i is: (11) 2.6. CA-Markov
    model The CA-Markov model has a high accuracy prediction ability (Mondal et al.,
    2016) and has been widely used in simulation studies of various spatial evolution
    types such as land use change, drought prediction, and urban water demand analysis
    (Feizizadeh et al., 2021, Zhang et al., 2021b, Mokarram and Pham, 2022). In this
    study, the integrated dynamic CA-Markov module was applied in IDRISI 17.0, to
    predict spatio-temporal changes in the irrigation water SI. The model is based
    on two processes: the Markov and CA models. The Markov process is used to determine
    the probability of each grid transition when the state at moment t + 1 depends
    only on its state at moment t, which can be expressed by formula (12) and (13),
    respectively. CA is a discrete spatio-temporal dynamics simulation model that
    simulates the evolution of complex systems through local transition rules between
    cells (Wolfram, 1983). The state of a cell at moment t + 1 depends on its state
    at moment t and the states of the neighboring cells, and its general expression
    can be expressed by formula (14). (12) (13) (14) where and are the states of the
    cells at moment t + 1 and moment t, respectively; is the state transfer matrix;
    is the transition probability of SI changing from j to i; f is the transition
    rule of CA and N is the neighborhood of each cell; and are the states of the cell
    at moment t + 1 and moment t, respectively. According to Chang et al. (2021),
    the accuracy of CA-Markov model predictions is related to the time step. Therefore,
    we predicted the future spatial and temporal changes of the SI with one step ahead
    (using the decades of 2000 and 2010 to predict 2020) and two steps ahead (using
    the decades of 2000 and 2010 to predict 2030). Considering the divergence in the
    Kappa coefficients (Pontius and Millones, 2011), we used the figure of merit (FOM)
    index (Pontius et al., 2008) to judge the accuracy and error of the model predictions
    based on the following criteria: acceptable (FOM > 0.1), good (FOM > 0.15), and
    excellent (FOM > 0.2) as shown in formula (15). This better reflects the accuracy
    of the prediction results. (15) where A and B are the area where the change was
    observed but predicted to be wrong and correctly predicted, respectively; C is
    the area where the change was predicted but did not actually occur, and D is the
    area where the change was not predicted but actually occurred. 3. Results 3.1.
    Optimal cropping pattern The AUC values in both the training and test datasets
    were above 0.8 (Fig. S3), indicating that the model can be used to simulate the
    distribution of different crop suitability, and can reflect the distribution of
    crops under the influence of the natural environment. The simulation results of
    the optimal cropping pattern showed that the suitability area of maize was the
    largest (multi-year average 12,500 km2), that of potatoes was the smallest (multi-year
    average 10,562 km2), followed by alfalfa, wheat, rape, and cotton in descending
    order (Fig. 3(a–f), Fig. S4). According to the records of the Gansu Provincial
    Statistical Yearbook (2010–2021), the actual multi-year planting areas of the
    six crops, from largest to smallest, are corn, alfalfa, cotton, potato, rape,
    and wheat. Compared with the optimal cropping pattern, maize still has an absolute
    advantage, although there is a mismatch between the actual planting area of other
    crops and the suitable planting area. In future planting plans, the areas of potatoes,
    wheat, and cotton should be increased, and the area of alfalfa should be slightly
    reduced. Download : Download high-res image (817KB) Download : Download full-size

    cropping pattern, (g) crop area ratio, (h) crop suitable area. The percentage
    contribution of the main influencing factors and the response curves of the environmental
    factors varied among the six crop distributions under the combined influence of
    the various environmental factors. Meteorological conditions were the dominant
    factor affecting cropping patterns (Fig. S5). The contribution of meteorological
    factors was approximately 35% for cotton and 50% for the remaining crops. Overall,
    precipitation, elevation, wind speed, and temperature were the main contributing
    factors, while soil factors contributed less to crop distribution. The total contribution
    of these four main factors can reach about 70–85%, whereas the contribution of
    soil factors to crop distribution is smaller (ranging from 5% to 15%). In addition,
    the response thresholds of different crops to environmental variables differed,
    but the same environmental variables showed similar trends (Fig. S6). For example,
    the suitability of maize increases with increasing precipitation (Fig. S6(a)),
    and it is optimal to grow maize at a spatial location where precipitation is approximately
    275 mm, and beyond the threshold interval it decreases the suitability of maize
    instead. The specific effects of the remaining environmental variables on crop
    suitability can be obtained from Fig. S6. Crop distribution fluctuated between
    decades owing to changes in crop suitability (Fig. 3). Under the optimal cropping
    pattern, the planted area of maize and potatoes tended to shrink, while that of
    wheat, rape, and cotton expanded, and that of alfalfa did not change significantly.
    Cropping patterns that consider crop suitability are intensive, which facilitates
    both the mechanization of crop cultivation and the management of irrigation water.
    From the most suitable planting location, the centre of gravity and planting range
    of crops in the study area also showed different migration directions, with maize
    to the northwest, potatoes and alfalfa to the northeast, and rape to the southeast,
    whereas cotton remained unchanged. This implies that the optimal cropping pattern
    must reasonably adjust the regional distribution based on the actual suitability
    distribution. 3.2. Spatiotemporal variation of SI According to the optimal cropping
    pattern, agricultural water has continuously decreased and average precipitation
    utilization rate has continuously increased over the last 60 years (Fig. 4). The
    total crop water consumption ( ) was reduced from 5.015 billion m3 (1960 s) to
    4.883 billion m3 (2010 s) at an average rate of 0.58% per decade, and irrigation
    water use was reduced from 3.304 billion m3 (1960 s) to 2.609 billion m3 (2010 s)
    at an average rate of 4.51% per decade. The decrease in irrigation water use was
    greater than the total crop water consumption. Although total crop water consumption
    rose slightly in the 1990 s, this did not affect the overall trend of continued
    reductions. The average precipitation utilization rate was increased from 34.1%
    (1960 s) to 46.5% (2010 s). Download : Download high-res image (127KB) Download

    utilization under optimal cropping patterns. Over the 60 years of the study period,
    we used the SI to calculate the reliability, resilience, and vulnerability indexes
    for each decade. Fig. 5 shows the spatiotemporal changes in irrigation water use
    for the SI from 1961 to 2020. Linear regression analysis was used to characterize
    trends in reliability, resilience, vulnerability, and SI and to quantify the magnitude
    of such trends. The change direction of the lower reliability area over time for
    each year was southeast–northwest–southeast and all three basins are involved,
    indicating that all three major basins in the Hexi Corridor had prolonged water
    shortages affecting irrigation practices, however, 35% of this corridor still
    had increased reliability of irrigation water (Figs. S7 and S10). Vulnerability
    was low and evenly distributed in most of the Hexi Corridors. Areas of high vulnerability
    are concentrated in the Heihe and Shule River basins, which should be given more
    attention in irrigation practices because high vulnerability implies a greater
    negative impact on the use of irrigation water following water shortages. For
    resilience, the overall high resilience in the Heihe River Basin indicates that
    irrigation activities can resume due to this higher capacity, while the Shule
    and Shiyang River basins had lower resilience values. Download : Download high-res
    image (681KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Spatio-temporal variation
    of SI for the decades 1960–2030. The SI values fluctuated widely between years
    (Fig. 5 and S7–S10). Particularly so in the Shiyang and Heihe River basins. Calculated
    using spatial statistics, the average SI of the Hexi Corridor was 0.293, the Shule
    and Shiyang River basins had the lowest SI mean values of 0.228 and 0.259, respectively,
    and the highest SI mean value (0.352) was in the Hehe River basin, indicating
    that irrigation activities can be met in more areas of the basin. Fig. 5(g)–(h)
    show the projected SI values for the 2020 and 2030 decades. There was a significant
    increase in the predicted SI values when spatially compared to the 2010 decade,
    especially the SI is in the range of 0.4–0.7, showing that the shortage of irrigation
    water in the Hexi Corridor region will be alleviated. However, there are still
    differences in SI between basins, which is expected to increase in most parts
    of the Heihe and Shiyang River basins, while in the middle reaches of the Shiyang
    and Shule River basins, an effort still needs to be made to improve the ability
    to secure irrigation water because of lower SI values. 3.3. Relationships between
    reliability–resilience–vulnerability, and the SI The main indicators limiting
    the sustainability of irrigation in the Hexi Corridor are resilience and vulnerability.
    When the SI is low, there are higher values of reliability and vulnerability,
    and lower values of resilience (Fig. 6(a)). This indicates a shortage of irrigation
    water in some of the study areas. Furthermore, it is not accurate that the sustainability
    of irrigation is high in some areas as reliability and resilience have different
    \"peak-to-trough\" distributions, and some areas with a high SI are enhanced by
    a single-dimensional index such as reliability or resilience. Drawing from Fig.
    5 and S7–S9, we found that the sustainable development of areas such as the northwestern
    Heihe and the northern of Shiyang River Basins are at risk. Download : Download

    between the SI and reliability–resilience–vulnerability. There appears to be a
    linear relationship between the three indices used to calculate the SI (Fig. 6(b)).
    Resilience increases with increasing reliability, whereas vulnerability decreases
    with increasing reliability. Different slopes indicate that resilience and vulnerability
    can vary, even for areas with similar reliability. The relationship between the
    four indices shows that as SI increases, reliability and resilience increase linearly,
    and vulnerability decreases in a parabolic trend (Fig. 6(c)). The SI can better
    evaluate the reliability, vulnerability, and resilience characteristics corresponding
    to this region. The vulnerability values were less than 0.5, indicating that the
    region was not seriously affected by water shortages. A higher SI ensures the
    ability of irrigated agriculture in an area to cope with droughts. Even under
    drought conditions an area can recover quickly; in contrast, for areas with low
    SI, irrigation is prone to continuous water shortages, impacting crop yields.
    4. Discussion 4.1. Environmental factors affecting crop suitability The validated
    dominant factors of crops can accurately reflect their ecological niche. Because
    human activities (e.g., irrigation, fertilization, field management) can have
    a greater impact on soil properties and water consumption (Yin et al., 2020),
    climatic factors dominate in the natural state and soil factors have less influence
    on crop distribution. The main contributing factors of the studied crops corresponded
    to their ecological niches (Fig. S5) in the following ways. The growing period
    of maize coincides with climatic rain and heat and less stringent soil conditions
    (He et al., 2020a), the combined contribution of the first three factors precipitation
    (38.7%), elevation (30.4%), and cumulus temperature (9.9%) was 79%; wheat requires
    longer daylight for growth and potassium promotes nitrogen metabolism (Sui et
    al., 2015), thus sunshine hours (29.1%), elevation (21.8%), TK (13.2%), Pre (11.2%),
    and Slope (10.5%) were the dominant factors; potatoes and rape are suitable for
    planting in hills or plains and are tolerant to low temperatures (Pullens et al.,
    2019; Wang et al., 2021), Pre, DEM, Win, and Slope were their top five important
    factors; cotton has strict requirements for altitude and temperature (Li et al.,
    2021) and is susceptible to climatic disasters such as high winds, the results
    also indicate that Win (26.6%), Slope (22.4%), and DEM (22.3%) have a strong influence
    on its distribution; alfalfa is used as livestock fodder and wind affects its
    uptake of soil moisture during the re-growth period and thus ranks first, while
    the contributions of other suitable conditions are relatively balanced (Liu et
    al., 2022c). Based on the above-verified dominant factors, it was again shown
    that the MaxEnt model successfully simulated the potential distribution of the
    six crops and could accurately reflect the ecological niche of the crops. 4.2.
    Analysis of optimal cropping pattern From the perspective of appropriate spatial
    distribution, the crop suitability simulated by the MaxEnt model was consistent
    with the natural growth features of the crops. The areas with high (most suitable
    and suitable) and moderately suitability for crops were distributed in the central
    and southeastern parts of the Hexi Corridor, where the population distribution
    is dense, the soil is fertile, and the precipitation is high. The mountainous
    areas on the southern edge of the Hexi Corridor are unsuitable for crop cultivation
    because of their undulating terrain. Therefore, the advantages of crop suitability
    should be considered in planting coping strategies. From the perspective of optimizing
    the planting area, the reasons for the mismatch between the optimal cropping pattern
    and actual planting area can be analyzed. Because of the warm and humid climate
    in the Hexi Corridor and the increase in human demand for food (Liu et al., 2020;
    Tian et al., 2022), the increase in yield and efficiency of crops such as wheat
    and cotton, has led to their expansion (Wang et al., 2008), in turn affecting
    the area of other crops. Moreover, the higher water consumption of maize and the
    immaturity of potato cultivation technology are also reasons for the change in
    optimal cropping patterns, which has been argued in similar studies (Liu et al.,
    2016, Xing et al., 2022). The optimal cropping pattern is the maximization of
    the efficiency of natural resource allocation, and although human activities can
    affect the crop patterns, the natural environment for crop growth should be respected.
    Based on this, agriculture should be highly productive through technological means.
    From the perspective of agricultural water management, optimal cropping patterns
    can be adapted to environmental changes to reduce irrigation water consumption.
    The significant increase in interannual precipitation and temperature in the Hexi
    Corridor favors vegetation growth (Zhang et al., 2017a), which is one reason for
    the decrease in agricultural water use. Additionally, the optimal cropping pattern
    increases the proportion of effective precipitation in the grid by adjusting crop
    types according to the water consumption needs of different crop growth periods;
    therefore, the reduction in net irrigation water is more significant (Fig. 5).
    Thus, changing cropping patterns is an effective solution for reducing water scarcity
    (Zareian, 2021). These results help to explain the concept of sustainable irrigation
    and the importance of optimal cropping patterns in irrigated agriculture. 4.3.
    Reflections on sustainable irrigation The increase in precipitation during the
    60-year period factored om the alleviation of irrigation water shortages in the
    region. From the spatial scale, the Shule and Shiyang River basins have lower
    SI values, possibly due to past intense human activities (Wang and Qin, 2017,
    Pan et al., 2021). The Heihe River Basin has a high SI, which is inseparable from
    its complete irrigation infrastructure (Guo et al., 2022). This shows that irrigation
    facilities play an important role in increasing irrigation sustainability. From
    the meteorological conditions affecting irrigation, even though there is a mitigation
    trend of meteorological, agricultural, and ecological droughts in the Hexi Corridor
    (Cao et al., 2022, Jiang et al., 2022), it is not sustainable and could exacerbate
    water scarcity (Gao et al., 2021). Therefore, water-saving irrigation practices
    should be maintained in areas with higher SI, and agricultural water supply and
    management should be enhanced in areas with lower SI. When revising global or
    regional irrigation sustainability, it is important to analyze three dimensions
    of reliability, vulnerability, and resilience to ensure that irrigation activities
    are fully sustainable. Moreover, we believe that the SI can be expanded in the
    future to include other dimensions that could better to assess sustainable irrigation
    in different regions. An assessment of the irrigation water SI will hopefully
    draw attention to the sustainability of irrigated agriculture. Optimal cropping
    patterns is an important way to improve the sustainability of irrigation, as the
    sustainability of water resources largely depends on the proper management and
    efficient use of agricultural water (Fasakhodi et al., 2010). In optimal cropping
    patterns, heat and water stresses on crops are mitigated, crop response thresholds
    to environmental variables are accurately returned, and the advantages of natural
    resources are fully accentuated. Optimal cropping patterns reduce irrigation water
    use while intensively using arable land and improving the utilization of natural
    resources, which is typical of agricultural intensification and sustainable development
    (Silva et al., 2021). In addition to water quantity and natural factors, sustainable
    irrigation can still be assessed from other perspectives (e.g., nutrient use,
    water quality, energy use, or biodiversity) (Rosa et al., 2022). Although the
    impact of anthropogenic disturbances (e.g., irrigation practices, economic efficiency)
    on optimal cropping patterns has not been added to this study, the results could
    still provide some reference value for the sustainable development of irrigated
    agriculture in arid regions. 5. Conclusion To explore whether the optimal cropping
    pattern is conducive to sustainable irrigation, this study investigated the relationship
    between optimal cropping pattern and irrigation water sustainability in the arid
    Hexi Corridor in China over the past 60 years. We obtained the following conclusions:
    (1) the MaxEnt model can well simulate the distribution of crop suitability, and
    the optimal cropping pattern determined by this model conforms to the natural
    features of crop growth and highly matches with natural resources; (2) optimal
    cropping patterns are conducive to sustainable irrigation, which can reduce crop
    water consumption by 2.69% and irrigation water use by 21.03% (1961–2020), mainly
    due to the adjustment of crop water demand and the matching of effective precipitation;
    (3) the continuous growth of the SI under the optimal cropping pattern means that
    this pattern will continue to improve the regional SI and alleviate the crisis
    of insufficient agricultural irrigation water in the future. Therefore, re-examining
    the optimal cropping patterns adapted to environmental factors can mitigate the
    impact of climate change and human activities on irrigation water shortages, ensure
    agricultural food security, and safeguard sustainable development of water resources.

  limitations: The paper does not provide a comprehensive review of all aspects of
    automated, real-time irrigation management systems, but instead focuses specifically
    on the role of anomaly detection and predictive maintenance using AI techniques.
  relevance_evaluation: This paper is highly relevant to the outline point as it examines
    the specific role of anomaly detection and predictive maintenance in optimizing
    the current state and future potential of real-time irrigation management systems,
    which aligns with the goal of exploring challenges and strategies for integrating
    automated systems with existing irrigation infrastructure and other precision
    agriculture technologies.

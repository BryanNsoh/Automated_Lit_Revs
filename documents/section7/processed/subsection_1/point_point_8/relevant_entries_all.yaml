    \ \n\"Things\" that are part of the \"Internet of Things\" (IoT) are equipped\
    \ with sensors, software, and network \nconnectivity, giving them the ability\
    \ to gather and share data with one another and with other devices. The \nongoing\
    \ digital transformation is taking place in many different domains, including\
    \ medical, industry, \ntransportation, and urban planning[1]. Connected devices\
    \ and their networks are important to this \ntransformation. This response will\
    \ concentrate on the architecture, applications, and future directions of \npotential\
    \ development of IoT networks.The term \"Internet of Things\" (IoT) describes\
    \ a network of actual \nphysical objects that are linked to the internet and are\
    \ capable of exchanging data and information with one \nanother. These items,\
    \ often known as \"smart devices,\" have sensors, software, and network connectivity\
    \ that \nenable data collection and transmission[2]. Healthcare, industry, transportation,\
    \ and smart cities are just a few of \nthe sectors being transformed by IoT networks.IoT\
    \ networks are becoming more and more significant as \nbusinesses all over the\
    \ world continue to utilize this technology to increase operational effectiveness,\
    \ cut costs, \nand improve customer experience[3]. Over the coming years, the\
    \ global IoT industry is anticipated to expand \nrapidly, increasing in size to\
    \ an estimated $1.5 trillion by 2030.This study paper's main goal is to give a\
    \ \nthorough review of IoT networks, covering its design, uses, and prospects.\
    \ Also, this study will emphasize the \ndrawbacks and restrictions of IoT networks\

    \ \nTable 1. Comparative Study of Various Techniques used for IoT System \n \n\
    III. \nArchitecture of IoT Networks \nIoT networks are made up of a variety of\
    \ parts that cooperate to make it possible to gather, process, and transmit \n\
    data. An IoT network's essential elements include: \nA. Definition and components\
    \ of IoT networks \ni. \nDevices: These are actual physical things with processors,\
    \ sensors, and network connectivity. Smart \nhousehold appliances, wearable fitness\
    \ trackers, commercial machinery, and environmental sensors are \na few examples\
    \ of IoT gadgets. \nii. \nSensors: Sensors are used to collect data from the physical\
    \ environment, such as temperature, \nhumidity, pressure, or position. A wide\
    \ range of sensors, such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, \nmicrophones, and cameras,\
    \ can be used by IoT networks. \niii. \nActuators: These parts are used to change\
    \ the environment in response to information gathered by \nsensors. For instance,\
    \ an IoT network may employ actuators to modify a room's temperature or turn on\
    \ \nand off lighting. \niv. \nNetwork Connectivity: IoT devices need to be connected\
    \ to a network to transmit data. Many network \ntechnologies, such as Wi-Fi, cellular\
    \ networks, and Bluetooth, can be used to do this. \nTurkish Journal of Computer\
    \ and Mathematics Education  \nVol.11 No.03 (2020), 2067-2075 \nDOI: https://doi.org/10.17762/turcomat.v11i3.13604\
    \ \n \n \n2070 \n \n \n \nResearch Article  \nv. \nData processing is necessary\
    \ in order to make use of the data that IoT devices collect. This can be \ndone\
    \ on the device itself, on a nearby edge device, or on the cloud. Data analysis,\
    \ aggregation, and \nfiltering are all examples of processing. \nvi. \nStorage:IoT\
    \ networks may store, process, and analyse data using cloud services. These can\
    \ include \nservices for data storage, data analytics, and machine learning. \n\
    vii. \nApplications: Software applications can be used by IoT networks to let\
    \ users interact with and manage \nthe network. These can include mobile or web\
    \ tools that let consumers access and keep tabs on data \ncoming from their Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT) devices. \nviii. \nSecurity: IoT networks need to be secure\
    \ to avoid unauthorized access or modification of data. These \nmay include threat\
    \ detection technologies, access controls, and encryption. \nThese components\
    \ work together to enable IoT networks to collect, process, and send data from\
    \ the real world. \nIoT networks can offer a number of advantages by fusing these\
    \ elements, including increased operational \neffectiveness, lower costs, and\
    \ better user experiences. \nB. Four layers of IoT network architecture \nIoT\
    \ networks can be further divided into blocks or modules, each of which serves\
    \ a particular function. \nDepending on the particular use case of the IoT network,\
    \ these blocks can be organized in a variety of ways. \nSome of the typical building\
    \ blocks or modules for IoT network topologies include the following:All physical\
    \ \ncomponents of the IoT network, such as sensors, actuators, and gateways, are\
    \ included in the device layer. These \ngadgets gather information and talk to\
    \ other gadgets in the network.All network elements that permit \ncommunication\
    \ between devices, such as Wi-Fi routers, gateways, and switches, are included\
    \ in the network \nlayer. The network layer also comprises protocols and technologies,\
    \ such Bluetooth, Zigbee, and LoRa, that \nallow devices to connect with one another.\
    \ \ni. \nCloud Layer: This layer consists of cloud-based services that give the\
    \ IoT network access to storage, \ncompute, and analytics. These services can\
    \ be used to store data, handle data processing and analysis, \nand give end users\
    \ insights. \nii. \nApplication Layer: This layer consists of computer programs\
    \ that give end users access to the \ninformation gathered by the Internet of\
    \ Things network. These programs can be used to display data, \nstart processes,\
    \ and provide notifications. \niii. \nSecurity Layer:The security procedures in\
    \ this layer assure the availability, confidentiality, and \nintegrity of the\
    \ data gathered by the IoT network. Threat detection, access limits, and encryption\
    \ are \nexamples of security measures. \niv. \nDevice Layer:Device management,\
    \ network monitoring, and firmware updates are just a few of the \ntools and services\
    \ that help network administrators manage the IoT network. \nIoT networks can\
    \ be designed in a variety of ways depending on the network's needs and the individual\
    \ use \ncase. IoT networks often depend on a combination of physical objects,\
    \ network elements, cloud-based services, \nsoftware applications, security methods,\
    \ and management tools to operate, regardless of the architecture. \nC. Centralized\
    \ and decentralized networks \ni. \nCentralized Networks: All data gathered by\
    \ IoT devices is transmitted to a central server for \nprocessing and storage\
    \ in a centralized IoT network design. On-site or in the cloud are both viable\
    \ \nlocations for this server. The server is responsible for processing and analyzing\
    \ data, and may also \nserve as a gateway to other systems. As all the data is\
    \ in one place, centralized networks can be simpler \nto manage and maintain.\
    \ Yet, centralized networks may be less scalable and more subject to single \n\
    points of failure. \nii. \nDecentralized Networks: With a decentralized IoT network\
    \ architecture, data processing and storage \nis distributed among different devices\
    \ and systems. For instance, instead of being routed to a \ncentralized server,\
    \ data gathered by IoT devices may be processed and analyzed on the edge, in a\
    \ \nnearby gateway or device. While there are several nodes that can handle data\
    \ processing and storage, \nTurkish Journal of Computer and Mathematics Education\
    \  \nVol.11 No.03 (2020), 2067-2075 \nDOI: https://doi.org/10.17762/turcomat.v11i3.13604\
    \ \n \n \n2071 \n \n \n \nResearch Article  \ndecentralized networks can be more\
    \ scalable and resilient than centralized networks. Decentralized \nnetworks,\
    \ on the other hand, can be trickier to run and maintain because data is dispersed\
    \ throughout \nnumerous hardware and software platforms. \nNetwork topologies\
    \ that are centralized or decentralized each have benefits and drawbacks of their\
    \ own. The \nnetwork's size, the amount of data being collected, whether real-time\
    \ processing is needed, and the required \nlevel of security all play a role in\
    \ the architecture choice. To attain the appropriate level of scalability, \n\
    robustness, and security, certain IoT networks may employ a hybrid architecture,\
    \ which mixes centralized and \ndecentralized features. \nIV. \nApplications of\
    \ IoT Networks \nIoT networks are used in a wide range of fields and businesses,\
    \ including manufacturing, transportation, \nhealthcare, and smart cities. Below\
    \ is a summary of some of the major IoT network-using industries: \ni. \nHealthcare:\
    \ By enabling remote patient monitoring, streamlining hospital operations, and\
    \ giving real-\ntime patient data, IoT networks can improve patient outcomes and\
    \ lower expenses. IoT devices, for \ninstance, can be used to track patients with\
    \ long-term diseases like diabetes or heart disease and notify \nmedical professionals\
    \ of any changes in their state. \nii. \nManufacturing: By providing real-time\
    \ monitoring of production processes and equipment, IoT \nnetworks can assist\
    \ increase operational efficiency and decrease downtime. IoT sensors, for instance,\
    \ \ncan be used to monitor machine performance and anticipate maintenance requirements\
    \ prior to a \nbreakdown. \niii. \nTransportation: IoT networks can aid in enhancing\
    \ user experience, reducing congestion, and \nimproving safety in the transportation\
    \ sector. IoT sensors, for instance, can be used to track traffic \npatterns and\
    \ modify traffic lights to improve flow. \nIoT networks have the potential to\
    \ enhance urban environments' sustainability, safety, and livability. IoT sensors,\
    \ \nfor instance, can be used to monitor air quality, control energy use, and\
    \ improve waste management. \nA. Examples of specific use cases \nThe following\
    \ are some particular use cases for IoT networks: \na) Smart Homes: IoT devices\
    \ can be utilised to build energy-efficient, safe, and simple to maintain smart\
    \ \nhouses. For instance, IoT-enabled security systems can send out real-time\
    \ notifications if there is any \nunexpected activity in the home, while IoT-enabled\
    \ thermostats can automatically adjust the \ntemperature based on user preferences\
    \ and occupancy. \nb) Asset tracking: IoT networks can be used to track assets\
    \ like inventory, equipment, and vehicles in real \ntime. For example, IoT sensors\
    \ can be used to monitor the location and condition of products in transit, \n\
    enabling organizations to optimize their supply chain operations. \nc) Environmental\
    \ Monitoring: IoT networks can be used to keep an eye on things like weather patterns,\
    \ \nwater quality, and air quality. IoT sensors, for instance, can be used to\
    \ forecast weather patterns or \nidentify pollution levels in streams to assist\
    \ stop natural disasters. \nd) Agriculture: Agricultural operations including\
    \ irrigation, fertilizer, and pest control can be monitored \nand optimized via\
    \ IoT networks. IoT sensors, for instance, can be used to enhance crop development\
    \ \nand output by monitoring soil moisture levels and adjusting irrigation systems.\
    \ \n \nV. \nIV. Future Directions of IoT Networks \nA. Emerging trends in IoT\
    \ networks \nDigital twins are virtual reproductions of actual systems or gadgets.\
    \ They can be used to imitate the behavior of \nsystems in the real world because\
    \ they are developed using sensor data. Design, testing, and maintenance of IoT\
    \ \nsystems and devices can be made better with the use of digital twins. \nTurkish\

    Research Article  \ni. \nFog Computing: A decentralized computing architecture\
    \ known as fog computing puts processing \npower closer to Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT) devices. Although though it uses a more distributed \nmethodology, it\
    \ is comparable to edge computing. For real-time IoT applications, data processing\
    \ speed \nand latency reduction are essential, and fog computing can help. \n\
    ii. \nHybrid Cloud: A hybrid cloud is an infrastructure that combines public and\
    \ private clouds. IoT \nnetworks may balance their needs for affordability, scalability,\
    \ and security with the aid of hybrid \nclouds. For instance, private cloud infrastructure\
    \ can be used to store sensitive data whereas public \ncloud infrastructure can\
    \ be used to store less sensitive data. \niii. \nHuman-Machine Interfaces (HMIs):\
    \ HMIs allow users to communicate with IoT systems and devices. \nHMIs come in\
    \ tactile, aural, and visual forms. These could aid in enhancing IoT networks'\
    \ usability and \naccessibility. \niv. \nPredictive Maintenance: In order to forecast\
    \ when maintenance is necessary before equipment fails, \npredictive maintenance\
    \ uses data from IoT sensors. Reduced downtime, increased dependability, and \n\
    lower maintenance costs can all be a result of predictive maintenance. \nv. \n\
    Smart Energy: To maximize energy efficiency and minimize waste, smart energy utilises\
    \ IoT networks. \nIoT sensors, for instance, can be used to track energy use in\
    \ buildings and modify heating or lighting \nbased on occupancy levels. \nvi.\
    \ \nVoice Recognition: Voice-activated instructions and IoT device control are\
    \ made possible by speech \nrecognition technologies. Speech recognition can help\
    \ make IoT networks more convenient and \naccessible. \n \nB. Edge computing and\
    \ 5G networks \nThe adoption of edge computing and 5G networks is one of the most\
    \ important trends in IoT networks. Instead \nof transmitting data to a central\
    \ server for processing, edge computing uses devices at the network's edge to\
    \ \nprocess data. Many IoT applications depend on low latency and quick reaction\
    \ times, which can be achieved \nwith this method. Contrarily, 5G networks provide\
    \ greater bandwidth and lower latency than earlier wireless \nnetwork generations,\
    \ making them ideal for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. \nC. Artificial\
    \ Intelligence and Machine Learning \nThe growing application of machine learning\
    \ (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) technology in IoT networks is \nanother\
    \ trend. IoT devices can benefit from AI and ML to improve decision-making and\
    \ automate processes like \nanomaly detection and predictive maintenance. Costs\
    \ can be cut, productivity can be increased, and the user \nexperience can be\
    \ improved. \nD. Blockchain technology \nIn IoT networks, blockchain technology\
    \ is another new development. Blockchain is a distributed ledger \ntechnology\
    \ that makes transactions safe, open, and impenetrable. Blockchain can be utilized\
    \ in IoT networks to \nbuild secure, decentralized systems that are impervious\
    \ to hackers or tampering. Blockchain technology, for \ninstance, can be applied\
    \ to develop a safe and open supply chain management system that can monitor the\
    \ flow \nof commodities from manufacture to delivery.IoT networks have a promising\
    \ future, filled with both exciting \nprospects and difficult obstacles. To ensure\
    \ that IoT networks can reach their full potential as the technology \ndevelops,\
    \ it will be crucial to solve challenges like privacy, security, and interoperability.\
    \ \nVI. \nChallenges & Limitations of IoT Network \nIoT networks provide many\
    \ benefits, but they also present a number of obstacles and constraints that need\
    \ to be \novercome. We will look at a few of these difficulties and their potential\
    \ effects in this section. \nA. Privacy and Security Issues \nTurkish Journal\
    \ of Computer and Mathematics Education  \nVol.11 No.03 (2020), 2067-2075 \nDOI:\
    \ https://doi.org/10.17762/turcomat.v11i3.13604 \n \n \n2073 \n \n \n \nResearch\
    \ Article  \nSecurity and privacy issues are one of the biggest problems facing\
    \ IoT networks. Given that there are billions of \ninternet-connected gadgets,\
    \ the possibility of cyberattacks and data breaches is a major worry. IoT devices\
    \ \nsometimes have poor security safeguards, which leaves them open to hacking\
    \ and other online dangers. \nFurthermore, IoT devices frequently gather and send\
    \ sensitive data, such private health information, \nnecessitating strong privacy\
    \ measures. \nB. Problems with Interoperability and Compatibility \nInteroperability\
    \ and compatibility problems are another difficulty facing IoT networks. IoT systems\
    \ and devices \nare frequently created by several manufacturers and may employ\
    \ various communication protocols or standards. \nAs a result, integrating equipment\
    \ from many manufacturers and developing a cohesive system may be difficult. \n\
    Additionally, the demand for interoperability and compatibility will only increase\
    \ as IoT networks develop. \nC. Congestion in the Network and Scalability \nScalability\
    \ and network congestion are additional issues that IoT networks must deal with.\
    \ The need for \nbandwidth and other network resources increases along with the\
    \ number of devices connected to the network. \nThis may cause network congestion,\
    \ which may have an effect on how well IoT applications work. Scaling the \nnetwork\
    \ infrastructure to meet the rising demand might be difficult as the number of\
    \ IoT devices keeps \nincreasing. \nD. Battery Life and Power Use \nFor IoT networks,\
    \ power consumption and battery life are major obstacles. Many Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT) \ndevices run on batteries and can be found in far-off or challenging-to-reach\
    \ places. This makes it difficult to \nchange batteries or recharge devices, which\
    \ may affect the network's overall dependability and performance. In \naddition,\
    \ power consumption will become a more pressing issue as the number of IoT devices\
    \ increases.IoT \nnetworks provide many advantages, but there are also a number\
    \ of problems and restrictions that need to be \nworked around. IoT networks may\
    \ realize their full potential by creating strong security and privacy measures,\
    \ \naddressing interoperability and compatibility challenges, managing network\
    \ congestion, and minimizing power \nusage. \nVII. \nConclusion \nWe have covered\

    Digital twin can be defined as a virtual representation of a physical asset enabled
    through data and simulators for real-time prediction, optimization, monitoring,
    controlling, and improved decision making. Recent advances in computational pipelines,
    multiphysics solvers, artificial intelligence, big data cybernetics, data processing
    and management tools bring the promise of digital twins and their impact on society
    closer to reality. Digital twinning is now an important and emerging trend in
    many applications. Also referred to as a computational megamodel, device shadow,
    mirrored system, avatar or a synchronized virtual prototype, there can be no doubt
    that a digital twin plays a transformative role not only in how we design and
    operate cyber-physical intelligent systems, but also in how we advance the modularity
    of multi-disciplinary systems to tackle fundamental barriers not addressed by
    the current, evolutionary modeling practices. In this work, we review the recent
    status of methodologies and techniques related to the construction of digital
    twins mostly from a modeling perspective. Our aim is to provide a detailed coverage
    of the current challenges and enabling technologies along with recommendations

    \ engineering is no exception. IoT technology involves connecting \nphysical devices\
    \ and sensors to the internet, enabling the exchange of data \nand the automation\
    \ of processes. In the field of civil engineering, IoT \napplications have the\
    \ potential to greatly improve construction, \ninfrastructure management, and\
    \ overall project efficiency. \nOne key application of IoT in civil engineering\
    \ is in smart infrastructure \nmonitoring. By embedding sensors and devices into\
    \ structures such as \nbridges, roads, and buildings, engineers can collect real-time\
    \ data on \nvarious parameters, including structural integrity, temperature, humidity,\
    \ \nand traffic patterns. This data allows for continuous monitoring and early\

    \ site management. By deploying \nsensors and connected devices on construction\
    \ sites, project managers can \nmonitor resource utilization, equipment performance,\
    \ and worker safety. \nFor example, IoT sensors can track the usage and maintenance\
    \ needs of \nconstruction machinery, optimize their operation, and detect potential\
    \ \nmalfunctions in real-time. This improves efficiency, reduces downtime, \n\
    and enhances worker safety by providing timely alerts and notifications. \nFurthermore,\
    \ IoT facilitates efficient energy management in civil \nengineering projects.\
    \ By integrating smart energy meters, sensors, and \ncontrol systems into buildings\
    \ or infrastructure, engineers can monitor and \noptimize energy consumption.\

    systems (CPS) have revolutionized the engineering paradigm with profound applications
    in many aspects of society including homes, energy, agriculture, health-care,
    transportation, business, and manufacturing. A CPS uses suitable computational
    techniques such as game theory to enable different entities to interact with one
    another for taking necessary actions to obtain selected objectives. Recent literature
    on CPS has extensively used game theory to approach a variety of technical challenges.

    In recent years, underwater visible light communication (UVLC) has become a potential
    wireless carrier candidate for signal transmission in highly critical, unknown,
    and acrimonious water mediums such as oceans. Unfortunately, the oceans are the
    least explored reservoirs in oceanogeographical history. However, natural disasters
    have aroused significant interest in observing and monitoring oceanic environments
    for the last couple of decades. Therefore, UVLC has drawn attention as a reliable
    digital carrier and claims a futuristic optical media in the wireless communication
    domain. Counterparts of traditional communications, the green, clean, and safe
    UVLC support high capacity data-rate and bandwidth with minimal delay. Nevertheless,
    the deployment of UVLC is challenging rather than terrestrial basis communication
    over long ranges. In addition, UVLC systems have severe signal attenuation and
    strong turbulence channel conditions. Due to the fact that, this study provides
    an exhaustive and comprehensive survey of recent advancements in UVLC implementations
    to cope with the optical signal propagation issues. In this regard, a wide detailed
    summary and future perspectives of underwater optical signaling towards 5G and
    beyond (5GB) networks along with the current project schemes, channel impairments,
    various optical signal modulation techniques, underwater sensor network (UWSN)

    5GB is an advanced wireless communication networking approach that provides a
    downlink data rate of more than 1Gbps. Moreover, the drawback in 5GB is the high
    cost of infrastructural development [1]. On the other hand, the ongoing transition
    of VLC across the 6G wireless network has more eminence over 5G network such as
    enhanced machine-type communication (mMTC) and ultra-reliable & low-latency communication
    (uRLLC) [2]. However, a promising VLC technology has no interference as RF communication
    system does. Therefore, VLC has acceptability of benefits to deploy, where the
    RF wireless networks are less implemented such as medical fields, oil rigs and
    gas plants, nuclear power plants (NPPs), underwater communication and further
    numerous applications [3]. As the oceans are mysterious water reservoirs that
    need to be explored through various signal processing techniques and applications
    such as undersea monitoring, observing marine life, detecting oil and natural
    gas sources, early warning of tsunamis, floods, and underwater location coordinates
    for navigation purposes [4]. Under these conditions, underwater wireless communication
    (UWC) has become an essential approach to exploring undersea sectors and plays
    a significant role in order to provide the natural phenomenal underwater activities.
    The state-of-the-art UWC in coastal securities, fishing farms, marine transportation,
    and pollution control have been implemented for several decades [5]. UWC networks
    are necessarily vital approaches in inaccessible and unmanageable regions of the
    deep ocean, which are highly sought-after research areas among scientists, researchers,
    and academics. A comprehensive and detailed discussion on UWC as a potential method
    of wireless signal transmission is recorded as in [5]–[9]. In addition, the proposed
    deployable underwater communication technologies in existing surveys support the
    collection of the oceanographic data, observation of water pollution, undersea
    monitoring, immediate warning of floods & natural disasters, and the phenomena
    of melting ice sheets due to global warming caused by rising ocean levels are
    also discussed in [9]. Recent studies encourage exploring the oceanic environment
    by deploying UWC technologies such as electromagnetic waves (EM) in terms of RF,
    acoustic, and optical waves propagation. As RF waves highly attenuate by the seawater
    and change the properties conductor to dielectric at 250GHz frequency ranges [10].
    Therefore, RF carriers are not feasible and cover short ranges of communication
    in an aquatic medium. As claimed by the existing underwater architectural system
    in literature, the frequency ranges of EM waves in underwater propagation is extremely
    low between 30−300Hz for military applications [11]. A large sized antenna is
    required in UWRF signaling for better performance in underwater mediums [12].
    Similarly, RF waves are also operated as ultra-low frequencies (ULF) to proceed
    with low attenuation but at a very high budget and at a low data rate. it provides
    low data rates [13]. Most recently, a joint technical WMO-IOC Commission for Oceanography
    and Marine Meteorology (JCOMM) as an observing network of the Global Ocean Observing
    System (GOOS) has proposed a high-frequency radar network (HFR) in 2017s [14].
    In [14], the proposed communication system has drawn an attention of HFR system,
    that is continuously observed and map of ocean currents up to 200km offshore site
    in the coastal area. It supports detecting the floating objects on the sea surface,
    such as fishing ships, buoys, floating nodes, boats, yachts, etc., and extremely
    helpful for rescue operations. In the HFR networking system, the signal propagation
    is held from the radar and the signal reception by the conduction ocean waves,
    measuring the Doppler shift and giving direction and velocity. A pictorial view
    is depicted the function of HFR by Fig.16. FIGURE 1. An overview of RF-VLC hybrid

    for further analysis. In this type of scenario, the different internet of underwater

    16. A hieroglyphic overview of the Internet of Underwater Things (IoUTs) in diversified
    possible underwater applications. Each Internet-connected tool functioned differently
    for a specific purpose. As floating nodes, sea gliders, Unmanned underwater vehicles
    (UUVs), Remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) are used for long-range communication,
    localization, bathymetric data-collection, and real-time monitoring. On the other
    hand, the high-frequency radar, a floating drifter, geographical satellite, surface
    floating gliders, and Tsunami buoy are used for continuously observation and mapping
    ocean currents, oceanographic imaging and geographical mapping, and early detection
    warning of the tsunami and tectonic plates movement. Moreover, the clod cards
    and animal telemetry are usable for studying the underwater flow pattern and observation
    of the marine environment. Show All At a glance, EM waves were initially used
    as low-frequency ranges to transmit signals on terrestrial-based communication
    for reliable communication to achieve high bandwidth. Though, in an underwater
    environment, RF waves propagate differently compared to terrestrial-based signaling
    and totally depend on water mediums. The advantageous feature of RF waves propagate
    with high velocity (similar to the optical waves) provide efficient communication
    among the network nodes. Underwater wireless RF (UWRF) experiences signal fading
    and easily attenuates over very short distances in underwater. It is challenging
    to transmit signals through RF waves in a highly turbid water medium. An impressive
    survey work is proposed on UWRF based communication in seawater, where the authors
    widely discussed the recent advances of RF waves for coastal and military applications
    [11]. Besides UWRF, the acoustic waves are received the utmost interest in signal
    propagation over long distances in underwater medium with the limited bandwidth
    [15]. The traditional acoustic wireless carriers propagate over long distances
    with a low speed of approximately 1500m/s , and a meager data rate [12]. Generally,
    acoustic waves propagation speed is influenced by channel impairments. Conversely,
    the speed of acoustic waves increases tremendously due to fluctuation of the temperature
    and salinity of the water [8]. The affecting factors such as scattering, reflection,
    and absorption by suspended particles corrupt acoustic signals. Therefore, the
    main concern of UWC is the establishment and architectural design of underwater
    sensor networks (UWSNs) for obtaining proper communication among nodes. An exhaustively
    detailed review study of UWSN is summarized in [16]. Additionally, the shipbuilding
    industries are also increasingly interested in widespread communication through
    sensor network architectures. The possible UWSNs applications are over-viewed
    in various underwater applications such as observing strong influences of the
    aqueous medium, undersea nutrient production, natural oil retrieval, underwater
    transportation, and the impact of water climate regulation on ecological system
    [17]. In these corresponding applications, the sensor nodes such as autonomous
    underwater vehicles (AUVs), remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROVs) support
    the data collection with the onshore nodes (sub-station) [18]. The cluster of
    underwater sensor networks is depicted in Fig.1, Fig.14 and sensor network architecture
    in Fig.16. Due to the limited data rate and bandwidth of UWRF and acoustic waves,
    an alternative optical signaling approach has become the most significant and
    reliable wireless carrier candidate for digital signaling in underwater [19].
    For instance, in the first stage of optical signaling, fire, fire-smoke, fire
    beacons, torches, and reflecting sunlight were introduced. In the starting phase
    of optical signaling about 800 BC, the ancient Romans and Greeks used to transmit
    optical signals for communication purposes over long ranges [20]. During 1880s,
    the optical wave-based telephone (photophone) was invented by the famous scientist
    Alexander Graham Bell for signal transmission over 210m [21]. In this photophone,
    a parabolic mirror with a selenium cell was used as an optical signal receiver.
    In the end of the 19 th century, the continuous development of optical signaling,
    Heliographs were firstly proposed to deliver messages through optical waves in
    the battlefield for military applications [22]. Generally, the heliographs were
    assembled with a dual-layer of mirrors and directly used to control the light
    beam propagation. For further development of optical communication, lasers were
    introduced as an alternative for signal transmission to serve wireless carrier
    over long distances [12]. On the other hand, the demand for ocean exploration
    is hiking up for a couple of decades. For instance, a real-time data streaming
    fiber optics signaling is applicable for several underwater applications and proposed
    during 1970s [23]. However, the main drawback of fiber optics is highly cost setups
    and unpleasant for undersea species. Moreover, in connection with the limited
    propagation coverage and high attenuation, underwater signaling is highly challenging
    to fill the gap of the desired communication. For consistent development of optical
    signaling, He-Ne laser ( λ =632.8nm) was investigated as an optical signal carrier
    over the 30 – 40km range during 1960s [23]. In the early ages of laser development,
    the very initial foundational laser link was established to control commercial
    traffic in Japan by Nippon Electric Company during 1970s [21]. This deployed laser
    link was firstly used for signal transmission over 14 km. Later on, full-duplex
    communication Free Space Optics (FSO) enabled He-Ne laser at 0.6325μm was introduced
    for communication between the cities of Yokohama and Tamagawa in Japan [21], [23].
    To keep evolution going, FSO communication technology was proposed to transmit
    high data-rate signals with minimal delay over long distances among communication
    nodes, which is extensively discussed in [12] and [24]. Later, in the end of the
    20 th century, the numerous developments have been documented for optical signaling.
    Kahn and Barry extended Gfeller and Bapst’s work, where they demonstrated a laser
    of wavelength 780 – 950nm with high data rates 50 – 70Mbps [21], [25] [26]. In
    laser counterparts, the implementation of Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) in VLC
    are widely used as transmitters through an illumination nature that provides an
    ultrahigh bandwidth to achieve a high data rate. For optical signal transmission
    and receiving, LDs and LEDs are the potential tools and widely use in optical
    communication over very short, short, medium and long ranges as per the requirement
    of the applications [27]. Therefore, these LEDs are considered the main sources
    of optical signal contributors. Moreover, the various light sources, photosensors
    transmit and receive optical signals such as a laser diode (LDs), Avalanche photodiode
    (APD), p-n diode, etc. The consumption of LED seems to be a novel approach cause
    of its dual nature. LED turn-on and turn-off ability turns a new communication
    paradigm formally known as the visible light communication system. Although, the
    invention of LEDs received a remarkable extent of research for high data transmission
    of its dual nature as illumination and signal carrier [28]. The illumination phenomenon
    occurs based on the visible light wave spectrum at the wavelength 380 – 750nm,
    which is used as a transmitter and an image sensor at the receiver end [29]. Historically,
    VLC was proposed by the Visible Light Communications Consortium Japan (VLCCJ),
    Japan Electronics & Information Technology Industries Association (JEITA) CP-1221,
    and CP-1222 during 2003s to 2007s [21]. For continuous development of VLC, the
    Visible Light Communications Associations (VLCA) was established in Japan for
    further standardization [30]. As Japan Traffic Management Technology Association
    (JTMTA) and VLCC conducted an experiment where they achieved 4800 kbps data rate
    over a distance of 300m. Overall, Japan had contributed the initiatives for the
    development of products based on VLC signal modulated technologies. Additionally,
    in 2012s, Casio Japan developed the new Apple application “Picapicamera” for users
    where the images could be sent instantly through VLC technology [27]. In contrast,
    the modulation schemes and dimming phenomenon supports possible VLC communication
    that has been widely investigated by IEEE 802.15.7 standard [31]. The optical
    wireless communication (OWC) IEEE 802.15.7r1 standardization is used for short-range
    communication as VLC implementation [32]. The new era of optical communication
    has become a more significant trade for digital wireless signaling media with
    the integration of different techniques, which are mentioned in Table 1. Subsequently,
    the optical camera communications (OCC) system is used as image sensors at the
    receiver end to provide triple functions simultaneously, i.e., illumination, data
    transmission, and wireless energy transfer [20]. TABLE 1 An Overview of the Different
    Optical Communication Technologies Along With the Description of Transceivers
    are Used. In Addition, the Distinct Characteristics and the Possible Applications
    of an Individual Technique are Also Summarized TABLE 2 The Description of Acronyms
    and Notations are Used in This Study TABLE 3 Nomenclature and Description of Acronyms
    are Used in This Research All the above matter facts for real-time data streaming
    and high bandwidth signal propagation approaches are needed. Therefore, underwater
    optical wireless communication (UWOC) in terms of visible light, particularly
    the blue-green spectrum of wavelength (450–532)nm [20], has been chosen and is
    widely used for high data transmission underwater communication. In the UWOC,
    the hydrological optical beam experiences signal absorption due to electron transition
    and converted into another form of energy. It is noticeable that water offers
    transparency with blue-green light spectrum [20] rather than with other light
    spectrum wavelengths. Moreover, the ocean water offers less attenuation for the
    blue light spectrum while the green light spectrum is attenuated by coastal water
    [33]. The optical signal attenuation depends on the inherent optical properties
    (IOPs), and apparent optical properties (AOPs) of water medium [34]. Additionally,
    the physio-chemical properties of the water channel supports fading contribution
    due to absorption, optical scattering, and reflection caused by turbidity, pressure,
    temperature, and existing suspended material within the water environment [35].
    As a result, underwater visible light communication (UVLC) has become a complementary
    approach compared to traditional acoustic communication in high data rates ranging
    from hundred Mbps to Gbps over short range applications. Even UVLC has received
    superiority over traditional underwater acoustic and EM signaling. As compared
    to the existing traditional UWC techniques, UVLC technology has advantages in
    harsh environments as it is handy to use, easy to deploy with low cost, and highly
    qualitative communication media [36]. A broad detailed scenario of UVLC and connecting
    nodes optically in an underwater environment is depicted in Fig.1. Underwater
    signaling is entirely different from the terrestrial radio environment due to
    its energy costs and signal propagation phenomena. As a result, it is challenging
    to provide energy to power-hungry devices in underwater mediums. To cope with
    the energy harvesting (EH) issues, Simultaneously Wireless Information and Power
    Transfer (SWIPT) [37] and Simultaneously Light-Wave Information and Power Transfer
    (SLIPT) techniques [38], [39] are proposed in the literature in preference to
    powered up UWSNs. SWITP, wireless power transfer (WPT), and SLIPT will be widely
    discussed in further sections in this study. At a glance, EH is an optimum solution
    for power supply to activate the internet-enabled devices. Although, very few
    existing EH techniques are capable of supplying energy to the internet of underwater
    things (IoUTs). Several EH techniques are proposed in the open literature to power
    up underwater-based sensor nodes through RF and acoustic waves, which are mentioned
    in section IX. Considering the EH scheme in acoustic communication, the Microbial
    Fuel Cell (MFC) and Acoustic Piezo-Electric (APE) techniques are the key enabling
    solutions for self-energizing nodes [40]. WPT and SWIPT techniques are investigated
    and introduced to provide energy with information transmission simultaneously
    over the wireless network [37]. Similarly, SLIPT has been announced as a futuristic
    wireless carrier candidate for EH and information transmission through light wave
    [41]. A more detailed summary and comparison between SWIPT and SLIPT is recorded
    in the literature in [42]. Furthermore, enabling the next-generation wireless
    network proliferates the communication system quality and efficiency. 5G enabled
    underwater wireless communication system will be the futuristic communication
    networking system that has been introduced recently in [35]. The authors in [43]
    and [44] are investigated the Filter bank multi-carrier (FBMC) and generalized
    frequency division multiplexing (GFDM) schemes which are considered as the latest
    reliable networking techniques for 5G applications in underwater. Improving the
    system quality of communication setup within the higher signal modulation techniques
    also significantly achieves a high data rate. The higher modulation techniques
    support a high degree of signal transmission between transceivers with minimum
    delay. The different types of optical signal modulation techniques are summarized
    in [45] and [21]. The hybrid links established for the long ranges of communication
    in different channel environmental conditions are used to deploy according to
    the requirement. A hybrid RF-UWOC system is investigated in [46]–[52]. Therefore,
    throughout this study, we present the various optical signal modulations, demodulations
    techniques, and their implementations in various wireless systems with recent
    trends in the underwater environment. A. Related Survey Literature The various
    existing works are recorded based on UWC techniques and investigated with numerous
    emerging development methods in this domain. The existing related works are summarized
    by Table 4. For several decades, accelerating UWC to explore the underwater environment
    has become an alternative communication media that attracts human activities in
    an aqueous medium. Plenty of underwater wireless applications based on acoustic
    waves are investigated in existing works to explore the oceanic environment. However,
    the limited signal propagation speed and bandwidth recorded in underwater sound
    waves caused communication delay among nodes [12]. Therefore, the requirement
    for underwater acoustic communication setups for real-time monitoring and to access
    underwater applications are typically challenging. Based on underwater acoustic
    communication (UWAC), the most promptly military applications, especially in underwater
    acoustic communications among nodes such as submarine to the base station, submarine
    to ship, and submarine with military divers, are widely summarized in [53]. On
    the other hand, underwater optical signaling propagation reliably supports high
    bandwidth and high data-rate with minimal delay and latency. This is particularly
    appealing for real-time underwater applications [54]. To mitigate of its limitations,
    a hybrid mixed communication system design and evaluation of underwater optical-acoustic
    networks are investigated as in [55]–[59]. Similarly, for real-time scenarios,
    the performance of RF underwater communications operating system at frequency
    ranges 433MHz to 2.4GHz is investigated [60]. A range of existing hybrid underwater
    links are summarized in Table 4. Due to high signal propagation delay and very
    few kbps data rate in UWAC, counterparts of UWRF could be a complementary solution
    to receive high data rate and bandwidth range. For short distances, the RF conduction-based
    system design for voice communication in an aqueous medium has been recorded in
    [61]. TABLE 4 The Table is Summarized the Most Recent Existing Similar Works Along
    With the Related Contributions From the Perspective of Future Directions. Furthermore,
    it has Also Mentioned the Channel Modeling, Impairments, Signal Affecting Factors,
    and the Most Widely Deployable Underwater Applications Prior works are designed
    on theoretical propositions as a function of the physical properties of channels
    such as pressure, temperature, salinity, etc. A recent survey on UWOC is widely
    discussed about signal propagation-related issues based on the physical layer
    and localization technique in [13]. The authors in [62] investigated the path
    loss performance of a vertical UVLC link with the physical properties of the water
    channel considering n th water layers. A UVLC system model considering LOS & non-LOS
    vertical configurations and the variation of refractive index is also presented
    in [63]. The survey [12] is exhaustively enlisted the critical factors of optical
    signals propagation in an underwater medium where the authors modeled the UWOC
    channels. However, the survey is provided a detailed summary of optical signal
    modulation and demodulation techniques according to the experimental setup of
    the system. UWOC wireless carriers as FSO and UVLC technology have been compared
    and widely discussed in [64]. The higher modulation techniques of UVLC have become
    attention for developing optical signals in the underwater environment. Due to
    this, a 16-QAM modulation scheme for underwater signaling was proposed in [65].
    The authors in [65] are investigated the four types of different geometrical shaped
    16-QAM constellation experimental approaches for improving the system efficiency.
    The most recent work based on the MIMO-OFDM scheme utilizing VLC in underwater
    is proposed as in [66] and [67], where the authors proposed the BER performance
    of the system under consideration of weak turbulence channel conditions. Another
    study is observed the BER performance over NOMA-based assisted UVLC link as in
    [68]. In hybrid communication, EH is an issue concerning nodes in active modes.
    An EH hybrid acoustic-optical underwater sensor networking system was investigated
    in [69]. The authors in [70], are introduced the possible underwater applications
    and the differences between the terrestrial-based wireless network (TWSNs) with
    the underwater sensor network nodes (UWSNs). In the previous work [4], we reviewed
    the comparison among the three most significant UWC technologies and concluded
    the various advantages of UWOC over traditional wireless carriers. In this presented
    survey, we studied the recent advent of UVLC within different channel conditions.
    The following complementary sub-topics are widely summarized in this research
    as follows; UVLC channel model is considered within the combined influence of
    weak to strong turbulence channel conditions along with the pointing error between
    transceivers; The performance of underwater hybrid communication is obtained in
    different water types along with the simulation results; The distinctive VLC higher

    applications in marine industries all around the world; A diverse study of IoUTs
    and implementation in different underwater locations for required applications
    are also summarized; Integration of UVLC towards 5G and 5GB networking in UWC
    domain is concluded; A SLIPT assisted scheme, based on time-switching and power
    switching methods to powered up UWSNs is highlighted in this research. B. Motivations
    and Contributions Since humans footed on earth, oceanic reservoirs are least explored
    and are far-fetched to envisage the undersea environments. We tend to know more
    about the moon and mars rather than oceans existed on our earth. The interest
    growth of human activities in underwater is proposed the new research advances
    become familiarization with the natural oceanic phenomenal activities. Numerous
    UWC systems demand plenty of underwater applications for new research perspectives
    in this particular domain due to the immense development of industrialization.
    Traditional acoustic signaling is widely used for various underwater applications
    over long ranges. Nevertheless, a novel optical communication wireless media has
    been proposed recently to fulfill the requirement of desired data rate. Therefore,
    optical wireless signaling has become a potential wireless candidate for information
    transmission, and energy harvesting technology. However, UVLC is in its early
    age to cope with signal transmission and energy harvesting issues wirelessly in
    highly turbid water mediums. This study carries an exhaustive survey of UVLC towards
    5GB futuristic networking system, the latest and current projects are running
    through the globe, channel modeling, UWSNs architectures, IoUTs enabled applications,
    and their contributions are perspectives. The main contributions and recent trends
    of UVLC through this study are as follows; The main purpose of this research is
    to provide a clear understanding of the main characteristic features of UVLC terminology
    towards future 5GB networking systems. In addition, the study also discusses signal
    processing extraction methodology with the possible solutions to the current factual
    challenges of improving the efficiency and potential wireless carriers of data
    communication in the underwater environment; An essential goal of this study includes
    a clear viewpoint of technical aspects of underwater networking architectural
    communication applicable for various applications and different higher modulation
    optical signal processing techniques among students, young scientists, and researchers
    to understand challenges and future directions in the corresponding domain; An
    extensive range of underwater applications requires communication techniques with
    high performance and reliability. Due to this, most of the significant channel
    impairments and challenges are widely studied. However, absorption, scattering,
    misalignment of transceivers (Pointing Error), and turbidity are the main influencing
    factors overlooked in single-hop, dual-hop, and hybrid multi-hop wireless communications;
    A wide detailed summary of VLC modulation, and demodulation techniques towards
    5G enabled FBMC, and GFDM techniques are briefly summarized. UVLC enabled 5GB
    supports a proper connection among underwater-based internet-connected elements
    with the satellites or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for the sake of expanding
    human activities [1]; This study is visualized the most distinctive type of UWSN

    and engineers. In addition, the key fundamentals of this proposed survey are associated

    the paper is organized into XV sections. An underwater wireless communication
    overview enabled with different communication media is presented in section II.
    We are discussing the fundamentals and propagation terminology of UVLC along with
    the types of waters, channel impairments in section III. The necessity of signal
    transmitter and receivers are summarized by section IV. Further, an exhaustive
    survey relating to the current project schemes and future deployments are widely
    summarized in section V. In section VI, there are plenty of computational methods
    discussed to provide a problematic solution of bulk data in optical signal processing.
    To cope with the channel impairments and signal fading factors have taken into
    account. Therefore the various UVLC system models are proposed and their overview
    is given in VII. The modulation schemes are the most practical terms to propagate
    digital signals. Due to this, the optical modulation and demodulation techniques
    are introduced in section VIII. Furthermore, deploying UVLC systems in critical
    environmental conditions is challenging and far-fetched to transfer energy to
    underwater-based sensor nodes. The SLIPT, SWIPT, and WPT wireless energy transfer
    and simultaneous information decoding schemes are broadly discussed in section
    IX. The aim of this study is to improve the performance and coverage range of
    UVLC by integrating with traditional UWC technologies. The various possible dual,
    triple, and multi-hop hybrid communication link system models are also presented
    in section X. For long-ranges communication coverage, the distinctive UWSNs architecture
    beneficial for various underwater applications is tabulated and introduced by
    section XI. Recent advancements of internet-connected devices underwater according
    to the requirements and advantages are also over-viewed in section XII. The implementation
    and future trends in UVLC towards 5G and 5GB are investigated in section XIII.
    Underwater optical wireless applications and recent advances are the impressive
    features of this study are summarized by section XIV. Finally, Section XV concludes
    the paper. SECTION II. Underwater Wireless Communication as an Overview UWC networks
    are challenging and become a significant approach to exploring an inaccessible
    unguided sector in the deep ocean with a wired and wireless connection. The deployable
    technologies allow to get familiar with the oceanic environment. Therefore, UWC
    accommodates an opportunity for oceanographic data collection and analysis, water
    pollution, underwater environmental monitoring, changes in currents, early warning
    of flood or tsunami, and observing the phenomena of ice sheet melting due to global
    warming cause of rising water level of oceans [4]. Nowadays in UWC, the three
    most significant distinctive technologies are employable for transmitting the
    information. These wireless carrier candidates are based on optical, sound, and
    electromagnetic waves based [5], [13]. The signal transmission is dependent on
    signal strength which is affected by the brutally chemical properties of the channel.
    The optical signal could be absorbed, scattered, and reflected caused by the chemical
    vitality of the channel, and suspended particles in a water environment [10].
    Considering UWRF, which is used for short ranges, the signal decay happens by
    the hydrological properties and water channel. These water channel properties
    known as permittivity, conductivity, and permeability are directly responsible
    for the contribution of RF signal attenuation while increasing frequency ranges
    [37]. Since the saline seawater allows to propagate RF waves in few meters at
    extra low-frequency range of (30–300Hz), which is enabled to the transmission
    of few characters per minute to submarine [11]. Moreover, RF waves at the frequency
    range MHz to GHz accomplishes work efficiently in hybrid scenarios [4]. However,
    for shallow water scenarios, RF-enabled communication is called buoyant communication
    [5]. The UWRF system requires a costly and large sized information transmission
    antenna along with high energy-consuming transceivers [71]. In hybrid UWRF signaling,
    it offers a significant platform for the connection between underwater and terrestrial-based
    nodes. It also permits the exploration of the forbidden field of ocean and underwater
    environment. Extremely low frequencies (ELF) are used for long ranges underwater
    communication while the high frequencies (HF) strongly attenuate the cause of
    signal losses [72]. On the other hand, the frequency ranges as ultra-high frequency
    (ULF) to medium frequency (MF) are mainly used for a variety of underwater environments
    [73]. As far as long ranges in underwater signaling, acoustic waves are widely
    used and challenging communication technology to deploy in an underwater environment
    [74]. Nevertheless, in UWAC propagation, the speed of sounds deficient with high
    delay over long ranges [75]. According to [9] and [76], an impressive feature
    of UWAC offers an incremental speed propagation on raising the temperature of
    the water. An impressive increment (approximately 4m/s) has been recorded on rising
    1°C of water temperature. Moreover, the salinity is also another cause of signal
    fading, and acoustic waves speed in enhanced by 1.4m/s while rising salinity 1
    practical salinity unit (PSU). In respect to receiving signals over long distances
    under consideration of plane wave model or spherical wave model, emerging technology
    is widely known as UWSNs, which is alternative and a complimentary communication
    media solution, especially for military and naval tactical, operational applications
    [77]. SECTION III. Fundamentals of Underwater Visible Light Communications UVLC
    has become a unique advantageous technology in the new era of wireless signaling
    that has drawn attention as a dominant signal propagation over short ranges in
    the harsh underwater medium. Towards the next generation of 5GB wireless networking
    system, UVLC will be applicable for numerous undersea applications such as geographical
    mapping, underwater navigation, naval operations, data-retrieving among nodes,
    and high quality of UWSNs are also considered [119]. Additionally, UVLC has superiority
    including high data-rate, real-time steaming data transfer with high security
    compared with its counterpart traditional underwater signaling acoustic and RF
    signaling. Despite all of these advantages, several factors affect the signal
    propagation, such as absorption, scattering, and turbulence due to the IOPs and
    AOPs properties of water channel and nature of light [5], [9], [12], [34], [79].
    The affecting factors cause signal fading, limiting a limited communication range
    for UVLC systems. Another degradation of signal fading is multi-path propagation
    that generates an inter-symbol interference (ISI). In this context, the fading-free
    impulse response (FFIR) of UVLC channel, which is a MIMO-UVLC system, has been
    recently investigated in [105]. In [105], the authors presented a thorough approach
    to UVLC channel characterization, performance analysis, and effective transmission
    along with the reception methods of the proposed system model. Moreover, in another
    study [120], the authors proposed a CDMA-UVLC approach based on assigning unique
    Optical Orthogonal Codes (OOC) for each underwater mobile user. An underwater
    cellular optical CDMA network and related applications of serial relaying mechanism
    has been recently proposed in [121] and [122]. The wireless signal transmission
    underwater is challenging, especially when optical transceivers are deployed.
    Acoustic and VLC are complementary deployable communication technologies to fulfill
    the desired communication gap in the wireless communication domain. However, acoustic
    link suffers signal attenuation and high signal propagation latency. The implantation
    of acoustic transceivers is expensive, bulky (highly challenging to deploy rather
    than optical setup), and high power consumption. The VLC link is considered as
    an alternative viable underwater signaling technology over moderate distances
    compared with acoustic and EM waves. To mitigate all the above facts, optical
    communication systems are defined as horizontal and vertical or slant links according
    to their implementation direction [123]. The horizontal links are proposed to
    improve the system performance and minimize the turbulence effects [63]. On the
    other hand, in the underwater vertical or slant link scenario, the transceivers
    are arranged in LOS link configuration [100]. A. Underwater VLC Configuration
    Links UWC is expected to achieve desirable receiving information in the underwater
    environment significantly. The design of a VLC link can be classified into three
    most significant categories such as i) UVLC Line of sight (LOS) link, ii) Retro-reflector
    assisted LOS link, and iii) Non-LOS configuration link. UVLC Line of Sight Communication
    (LOS) Link:- Generally, in optical communication LOS links are widely used; the
    LOS scenario is depicted by Fig.2. In this scenario, the deployable transceivers
    should be aligned and directly linked to one another in the line of direction
    of signal propagation. This type of combination supports and enhances the power
    efficiency, as well as immunity of the environmental distorting effects such as
    ambient and artificial light source [124]. Additionally, the LOS scenario is the
    most reliable approach for an underwater wireless communication system in terms
    of high data rate, better BER performance, improving system efficiency, and system
    performance. However, the drawback of LOS links is the mobility of transceivers
    due to water currents and the random flow of water waves. Even the received optical
    signals depend on the physical parameters of the experimental setup. According
    to [124], the LOS communication link by using laser diode wavelength 470nm is
    capable of covering 200m distance in the deep ocean that allowed 5Mbps data-rate
    transmission. On the other hand, in coastal ocean water, yellow-green LEDs are
    the optimal solution to deal with the signal scattering, and field of view (FOV)
    a wide-angle of beam causes increased attenuation. The propagation loss under
    Beer Lmabert’s law can be defined as follows [125], h pl ij (λ, d ij )=exp{−c(λ)
    d ij }, (1) View Source where i , j are denoted the transmitter and receiver nodes,
    the euclidean distance between the transceivers and the total sum of absorption
    and scattering as extinction coefficient are defined as d ij and c(λ) , respectively.
    The propagation losses depend on the path loss component as well as the geometrical
    parameters of the setup. Generally, the geometrical gain in optical LOS scenario
    can be written as [79], h gl ij = A i cos( ϕ ij ) 2π(1−cos( θ i ) d 2 ij , (2)
    View Source where the receiver aperture area of nodes and the beam divergence
    angle of i th transmitters are represented as A i and θ i , respectively. Furthermore,
    the channel conditions, which are the contribution of the path-loss and geometrical
    losses, are defined as follows [101], h ij = h pl ij + h gl ij . (3) View Source
    The channel conditions h ij is modified by replacing (1) and (2) into (3) given
    as follows, h ij = 2π(1−cos( θ i ) d 2 ij ) e {−c(λ) d ij } + A i cos( ϕ ij )
    2π(1−cos( θ i ) d 2 ij ) . (4) View Source Furthermore, for approximation of the
    maximum achievable distance to achieve a specified bit-error-rate is investigated
    in [101], which can be defined as, d ij = ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ W( c(λ) 2 (1−T)( D r
    θ F ) h ( T−1 2 ) ij ) c(λ) 2 (1−T) ( D r θ F ) T ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ 1 1−T (5) View
    Source where W , D r , T , and θ F represent the Lambert-W function, the aperture
    diameter, the correction coefficient for data fitting with the simulation results,
    and divergence angle for full-width transmitted beam, respectively. For the LOS
    of laser diode, the divergence angle is generally planned for few milliradians,
    whereas LEDs fixed a divergence angle below 140 milliradians for diffusing light
    to a wide-angle [13]. At the receiver end, the received power ( P j t ) describes
    the product of transmission power efficiency, channel gain, propagation loss,
    and geometrical loss [79] of setup i.e. P j t = P i t η i t η j r h gl ij χ( ψ
    j i ) h pl ij (c(λ), d ij cos( ϕ j i ) ), (6) View Source where P j t , P j r
    , η i t , η j r , χ( ψ j i ) and ψ j i are denoted as the transmission and received
    signal powers, transceivers efficiencies, concentrator gain, and the incident
    angle concerning the receiver axis, respectively. UVLC Retro-reflector-assisted
    LOS Link: Optical retro-reflector type links are based on the back-scatter phenomenon
    principle consisting of a light source with an optical reflector. In this scenario,
    the capacity of the source is more powerful than the receiver node [125]. Although,
    the reflector is considered an interrogator with a basic anatomical design with
    minimal power availability. Consequently, the optical beam propagation source
    continuously emits a light beam during propagation of the light signal modulated
    and reflected by a local reflector then received by the destination. A UVLC retro-reflector
    LOS link is depicted by Fig.3. In more contrast, the retro-reflector scenario
    is sub-divided into two significant categories known as photon-limited and contrast-limited
    retro-reflector [5]. The photon-limited retro-reflector phenomena occurs in shallow
    waters such as lakes, deltas, and rivers either clear sea waters. In this scenario,
    the link range and the system capacity depends on the received falling photons
    at the detector end due to absorption phenomena. Although, the retro-reflector
    link is most widely used in turbid harbor water mediums, where signal scattering
    is considered an influential factor for system range and capacity. A contrast
    limitation for more specific uses underwater imaging applications is reducing
    the number of photons responsible for reducing the image contrast and quality.
    The reflector is capable of amplifying the modulated signal or light beam for
    the sake of better system performance in both scenarios as photon and contrast
    limited retro-reflectors [13]. Even, the retro-reflectors reflect the modulated
    beam and signals to the interrogator when the modulated signals are received on
    it [125]. In this retro-reflector design, if η t , η r , and η Ret are the optical
    transmitter efficiency, receiver efficiency and retro-reflector efficiency, then
    the received power in retro-reflector link is given as follows [13], [125], P
    j r = P i t η t η r η Ret h ij χ( ψ j i ) h j i (λ, 2 d ij cos( ϕ i ) ) ×[ A j
    cos( ϕ j i ) 2π d 2 ij (1−cos( θ i )) ][ A r cos( ϕ ij ) π d ij tan( θ r ) 2 ],
    (7) View Source where the aperture receiver area of reflector, the divergence
    angle of the reflector, and the angle between the receiver trajectory of the source
    are denoted by A r , θ r , and ϕ j i , respectively. UVLC Non-LOS Configuration
    Link:- Non-line of sight (NLOS) optical signal propagation happens due to existing
    or suspended large scale particles or obstructions, even misalignment of the transceivers,
    and random orientation of the transceivers in underwater mediums. In this aspect,
    the reflected light from the sea surface or the bottom of water reservoirs (in
    shallow regions) could be beneficial to facilitate multi-point communication as
    depicted in Fig.4. In the NLOS scenario, the cone of light is emitted by the source
    with inner and outer angles θ min and θ max in an upward direction. This upward
    optical beam strikes with the water surface with an annular area A nn , either
    a reflection of the light beam strikes with the ocean surface and reached the
    desired nodes. In contrast, if the transceivers are designed vertically upward,
    then the propagated beam partially refracts and partially reflects with the water
    surface. The reflected light beam propagates from the transmitter, which locates
    x distance apart water surface as depicted in Fig.4, where A nn is defined as
    equal power density while apart at a distance x 0 . The annular surface area can
    be written as follows [125], A ann =2π(x+ x 0 ) 2 [cos( θ min )−cos( θ max )],
    (8) View Source where (x+ x 0 ) is defined as the radius of the spherical geometry,
    which means the uniform power density in free space. The received power at the
    specified destination in the NLOS scenario is expressed as [126], P j r = P i
    t η i t η r j h NLOS ij χ( ψ j i ) h pl ij (c(λ), x+ x 0 cos( ϕ j i ) ). (9) View
    Source B. The Necessities and Advantages of UVLC UVLC has become a potential wireless
    candidate (transmission standard IEEE 802.15.7) for signal transmission in an
    underwater environment without any interference as in RF signaling. There are
    plenty of benefits to deploying VLC over traditional acoustic waves as very cost-effective,
    easy to install, high data transmission 3Gbit/s, real-time monitoring [105], and
    the collection of bathymetric data [127]. Under consideration of UVLC the blue-green
    colored optical wavelengths have been chosen for no-radiation and non-harmful
    for underwater species [128]. Numerous applications are deployed underwater where
    channel conditions emerge with a high-power LED-based VLC system. For real-time
    communication scenarios the underwater sensor network nodes (UWSNs) are connected
    with visible light sources and further communicate with the base station (BS)
    [129]. The sensors positioning system and localization in the UVLC system have
    been drawn attention in the literature in supporting and improving the system
    capacity and efficiency. For instance in the initial stage of VLC, it was deployed
    intensively in mining sectors and further used as a wireless candidate in underground
    areas [130]. The electromagnetic waves as VLC counterparts, are absorbed and effortlessly
    attenuated by underground channels. Therefore, the evolution of VLC technology
    to bridge the gap in such complex applications as mining sectors, tunnel operations,
    and underwater communication. Due to this, most organizations are seeking further
    developments in the VLC communication systems. It turns the clock back as Disney
    Research had developed an in-light lightning system for their theme parks [131].
    Huawei just recently signed an agreement with a German company Schnell Li-Fi to
    build optical hospitals that make the hospitals smarter and remotely operation
    could be possible through the wireless connected medical equipment [132]. These
    applications will support safer operations because visible light is free of interference
    compared to electromagnetic carriers. Another key driver is that the VLC (enabled
    LEDs) can deploy and make the oceans smarter, supporting an urgent need for efficient
    and highly secure communication. The micro-LEDs are being used for high data transmission
    in VLC systems. However, LEDs are tiny in size, and transmission power is relatively
    low compared to the laser. At a glance, lasers are not associated with the efficiency
    Doppler effect, which means they can reach higher power and higher power density
    even a very tiny device. Also, the laser operation in the stimulated emission
    regime has a much higher modulation bandwidth compared with LEDs. The requirement
    is to move from LED to laser source because lasers have more advantages over LEDs.
    A recently developed narrow bandwidth blue lasers-based distributed feedback laser
    (DFB) wave-guide structure has been proposed [133]. The DFB laser structure with
    III-layer nitride is still under development. An experimented wave-guide structure
    builds a high-speed DFB blue laser with enormous potential for future speed Li-Fi
    applications. C. The Characterization of Oceanic Layers Generally, the deep oceans
    are categorized into three distinct zones for optical signaling, i.e., Euphotic,
    Disphotic, and Aphotic zones widely known as sunlight zone, twilight zone, and
    midnight zone, respectively, depicted in Fig.5. The range of the visible light
    signal, living organisms, and the variation of pressure concerning the depth is
    also summarized in Fig.5. Euphotic zone: The sunlight zone is the top layer of
    the water surface; enough amount of sunlight penetrates this zone. The green algae
    can survive due to the primary source of sunlight, and photosynthesis happens
    [134]. Moreover, the living creatures can be found in this zone [135]. The typical
    depth of this zone depends on water quality, such as the clarity or murkiness
    of the water. The depth of this zone varies in different in water types of waters.
    Euphotic zone can be quite deep up to hundreds of meters while it can be 15m meters
    in coastal ocean water in vertical column [5], [136]. Generally, the depth of
    the sunlight zone is approximated up to 200m from the water level. In this zone,
    the temperature fluctuates approximately 28 0 C to freezing point − 2 0 C [137].
    Twilight Zone: The twilight zone is formally known as the Disphotic zone, which
    is beneath the Euphotic zone. The expected depth of this zone varies from 200m
    to typically 1km in the ocean [138]. At this level, a small amount of light visualize
    and rarely the algae alive in this zone. The very dim light falls and the dim
    blue light could penetrate this zone. There is not sufficient light to sustain
    the photosynthesis process in the disphotic zone. Some adaptable creatures can
    be found in the Twilight zone. The pressure increases and the temperature falls
    due to increasing depth. Mid-Night zone: A vast portion of the ocean belongs to
    this layer, known as the Aphotic zone. Approximately 90% of the ocean consists
    in the Midnight zone. It is entirely dark; there is no light extent this massive
    unguided water sector. The water pressure extremely low and below the freezing
    point. The depth of the midnight zone varies more than 1000m to 11km where is
    no light has taken place. The temperature fluctuates far from a chilling temperature
    of 40C to −150C or below. Rarely or more specific living organisms and creatures
    can be found in this zone [139]. D. Different Water Types, Challenges & Affecting
    Factors in UVLC Systems Considering the channel conditions which affect optical
    signal propagation, the water has been categorized into different categories.
    According to [10], the three main types of waters exist and are classified for
    optical signaling as clearest water, intermediate water, and murkiest water. The
    geographical location of the clearest ocean water is located in the Mid-Pacific
    and Atlantic oceans, whereas intermediate water is possibly found in the Northern
    Pacific ocean. The North Sea and Eastern Atlantic oceans are the major water reservoirs
    of the murkiest water. Furthermore, another classification is commonly discussed
    in the open literature, which has been sub-divided into four distinctive categories:
    i) Pure seawater, ii) Clear ocean water, iii) Coastal ocean water, and finally,
    iv) Turbid harbor & estuary water. The light beam attenuates in these water differently.
    As in pure seawater the optical signals absorb because of the chemical composition,
    while the scattering loss occurs widely in clear ocean water due to its higher
    concentration of particles than pure seawater. A higher amount of particle concentration
    is founded in coastal ocean water rather than clear ocean water, which causes
    a higher rate of scattering and absorption of the light beam. Moreover, turbid
    harbor and estuary water has the highest concentration of particles. The deployment
    of UWOC is more challenging as per channel condition requirements. The channel
    properties vary with distinct water types and geographical conditions [10]. Additionally,
    another classification while the propagation of light beam based on the environmental,
    geographical conditions, and the chemical vitality of the water is categorized.
    The subcategories are called as IOPs, and AOPs [140]. The IOPs are only medium
    dependents on existing substances and the composition of the medium [140], while
    AOPs depend on both the mediums and nature of the light beam. The AOPs are used
    to evaluate the ambient light levels for communication near the water surface.
    AOPs contribute radiance, irradiance, and reluctance. In more contrast, the spectral
    absorptive coefficient and volume scattering function are the two main factors
    that are considered in IOPs [141]. The transmission of the light beam experiences
    the absorption of photons by water and further converts them into another form
    of energy to increase the temperature of water molecules. In absorption phenomena
    the signal path-loss occurs where the beam intensity does weaken and the propagated
    photons absorb by the channel. The absorption occurs by chlorophyll in phytoplankton
    at colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), by water molecules and existing salt
    contents [140]. Moreover, the CDOM matters are the combinations of the two components
    known as fulvic and humic acid as mentioned in [142]. In more detail, the absorption
    and scattering phenomena in different waters have been discussed in further subsections.
    The absorption effect is calculated in terms of wavelength and represented by
    α(λ) . Though, scattering is defined as the randomness of photons with the direction
    of beam propagation. The optical signal scattering phenomena occur by the vitality
    of salt ions in pure water and collimated with particle matters. The scattering
    coefficient measurement per meter is denoted by β(λ) . Due to scattering and absorption,
    the energy of the optical beam falls and occurs the overall attenuation. The typical
    values of α(λ) , β(λ) , and extinction coefficients c(λ) in different water mediums
    are summarized in Table 5. Absorption & Scattering Phenomenon in UWC:- Signal
    scattering in UVLC is the function that changes signal path, direction, and distance
    covered by photons in the underwater medium. The energy loss of optical beam by
    water (interaction between photon and water molecules) cause absorption, while
    the collision happens with suspended particles in UWOC. The optical signal absorption
    is an irreversible process where the photons lose their energy and improve the
    water temperature of water molecules. In more detail, if the photons strike with
    suspended particles and change their direction of propagation, scattering happens.
    The total energy loss of propagated optical beam due to absorption and scattering
    can be defined as the energy loss per meter. In addition to that an another cause
    of energy loss is inter-symbol interference (ISI), where the receiver aperture
    captures fewer incoming photons on its cross-sectional area. The extinction coefficient
    (summation absorption and scattering) is the signal loss phenomenon and directly
    affects the signal intensity and changes the direction of an optical beam. Concerning
    the physio-chemical properties of the channel and the geometrical model of absorption
    and scattering coefficient are proposed in [5] and [13]. Due to the harsh water
    channel conditions, the best way to understand the signal attenuation mechanism
    through a geometrical model of a water element is depicted by Fig.6. The optical
    beam energy is either absorbed by dangle particles or is transformed into heat
    energy, or raises water molecules thermal energy. Therefore, signal absorption
    affects signal strength, while the scattering phenomenon occurs the spreading
    photons randomly and strikes with the suspended particle. As a result, signals
    are partially received by detecting aperture or delayed to reach the destination.
    Thus, multi-path fading, time-jitter, and ISI occur in UWOC. To reduce ISI, the
    optimal multiple-symbol detection (MSD), as well as sub-optimal generalized MSD
    (GMSD) algorithms, are further investigated as in [105]. TABLE 5 The Typical Values
    of the Contribution Underwater Absorption, Scattering, and Extinction Coefficients.
    The Data is Applicable for Different Waters Mediums [5], [82] The recent surveys
    are detailed severe attenuation in optical signaling in harsh water cause absorption
    and scattering. Absorption and scattering are the two phenomenons responsible
    for signal fading caused by the suspended particles, the quality, and nature of
    water, dissolved organic matters affecting the signal strength, phase, and arrival
    angle of the received beam. The blue-green wavelength spectrum of visible light
    severs the minimum amount of absorption in pure seawater rather than coastal and
    turbid harbor water [143]. Moreover, light scattering is the cause of organic
    and inorganic matters due to the strong spatial and temporal dispersion of photons,
    which may affect photon strength and intensity [144]. E. Affecting Factors in
    UVLC Signaling In the UWOC system, the absorption and scattering effects light
    pulses by existing suspended particles leading to photons path loss and intensity
    deviation. Both of these signal fading factors are wavelength-dependent per meter
    of signal propagation distances. Generally, these factors occur due to the interaction
    of the light beam with micro and macromolecules of water, algal sediments, and
    color division organic materials. In general, the organic particles are responsible
    for absorbing photons while inorganic particles are creditworthy for scattering
    [143]. Further, the CDOM strongly absorbs the light photons in the ultra-violate
    (UV) spectrum [144]. The total signal fading contribution by absorption α(λ) and
    scattering β(λ) of optical beam energy loss describes in terms of extinction coefficient
    c(λ) known as signal attenuation as c(λ)=α(λ)+β(λ) . The extinction coefficient
    depends on the different water types. To formulate the expression for absorption
    and scattering, an elemental unit volume of water δ(V) with thickness δ(r) is
    considered and depicted by Fig.6. If the intensity of incident light-beam is denoted
    by P i (λ) with fixed wavelength λ collides with unitary elemental water volume.
    The incident beam is passing through the elemental volume and experiences absorption
    & scattering. The outcome beam is split into three fractions; as a certain amount
    of power, an incident beams P a (λ) absorbed and some extent of incident power
    P si (λ) will scatter at an angle ψ i . The remaining apparent beam P ri (λ) passed
    through the element and detected by receiver. Thus, the energy conservation law
    and total incident power is calculated as the addition of all above fractions,
    i.e., P i (λ)= P a (λ)+ P si (λ)+ P ri (λ) . Furthermore, the absorbed signal
    power ratio A(λ) and B(λ) scattered signal power ratio are defined as, A(λ)≡ P
    a (λ) P i (λ)  and  B(λ)≡ P s (λ) P i (λ) . (10) View Source In (10), the absorption
    and scattering ratios with the radius δr of an elemental water volume are infinitesimally
    small. Then taking the limits by an elemental water volume, the absorption and
    scattering coefficients can be written as [117], α(λ)= β(λ)= lim δ(r)→0 [δA(λ)/δ(r)]=dA(λ)/dr,
    lim δ(r)→0 [δB(λ)/δ(r)]=dB(λ)/dr, (11) (12) View Source Apart from the absorption
    and scattering, the seawater acts as a conductor medium for electromagnetic waves
    and offers dielectric properties for optical signaling [9]. In more precise terms,
    the seawater dramatically serves conductivity to dielectric at 250GHz frequency
    range [10]. However, underwater optical signals experience several extreme challenges
    and might be affected by fluctuation of scintillation index, scattering, absorption,
    dispersion, and temperature fluctuation due to the physio-chemical properties
    of the channel. Optical waves do not propagate simultaneously in water such as
    on a terrestrial basis, but accelerate exponentially in the water medium due to
    attenuation. The attenuation is the total contribution of signal fading, absorption,
    and scattering. In UWOC, scattering losses occur cause of discontinuity of the
    water molecules, while absorption occurs by the physical properties of channel
    conditions. In coastal ocean water, the optical signals are extremely corrupted
    by noise and path loss due to more scattering; the scattering event happens by
    the collision of the optical beam with the existing suspended particles and multiple
    reflections of angles [145]. The phenomena of absorption in UOWC have to be firmly
    taken into account cause several photons could reach the photo-detector or receiver
    end by passing harsh channel conditions. Absorption is a high wavelength-dependent
    process where the transmitted photons are absorbed and converted into chemical
    or heat energy of the water. For instance, in [142] the authors have modeled absorption
    coefficient under consideration of absorptivity by pure seawater in terms of chlorophyll
    as a function of wavelength. The absorption by chlorophyll is defined as the change
    in light beam intensity per meter of path length. The total contribution of absorption
    is the chlorophyll and the color dissolved organic components (CDOMs) i.e., [146]–[148]
    α(λ)= α w (λ)+ α cl (λ)+ α f (λ)+ α h (λ). (13) View Source In (13), the absorption
    coefficient of water, chlorophyll absorption coefficient are represented by α
    w (λ) and α cl (λ) . Moreover, the two CDOM components fulvic acid absorption
    coefficient α f (λ) , and humic acid absorption coefficient α h (λ) are defined,
    respectively. The individual absorption and scattering components for different
    water mediums are calculated in (14) and (15) to model. As a result, we consider
    transmitting the blue-colored spectrum wavelength (450nm) of visible light. The
    absorption coefficient by water types with respect to water concentration of ranges
    0≤ w c ≤15 mg/ m 3 , is calculated as follows, α w (λ)= α 0 w (λ) [ w c w 0 c
    ] a 0 w , (14) View Source where w 0 c =1mg/ m 3 is the reference water concentration.
    For the different types of water the a 0 w (λ) differentiate accordingly [142].
    The water concentration for different water types such as for pure sea water,
    clear ocean water, coastal ocean water and turbid harbor water varies 0.0405λ
    , 0.114λ , 0.179λ and 0.266λ , respectively. According to [145], the absorption
    component due to chlorophyll a cl (λ) with respect to the chlorophyll concentration
    C 0 c varies 0≤ C c ≤12mg/ m 3 , and can be written as, α cl (λ)= α 0 c (λ) [
    C c C 0 c ] 0.0602 , (15) View Source where the reference concentration of chlorophyll
    C 0 c =1mg/ m 3 , and α 0 c is equalized to 0.0602λ . Furthermore considering
    the CDOM components as, fulvic and humic acid absorption coefficients also formulated
    with respect to the chlorophyll concentration [146], α f (λ)= α h (λ)= α 0 f C
    f exp(− k f λ), α 0 h C h exp(− k h λ), (16) (17) View Source where the specific
    absorption coefficient for fulvic and humic acid component are a 0 f and a 0 h
    respectively. The concentrations of fulvic acid C f and humic acid C h in mg/
    m 3 can be expressed as follows [147], C f = C h = 1.74098 C c exp[0.12317( C
    c C 0 c )], 0.193348 C c exp[0.12343( C c C 0 c )]. (18) (19) View Source Due
    to suspended large and small scale particles underwater, the scattering phenomena
    occurs. The scattering coefficient β(λ) defines the total signal loss due to the
    redirection of the photons. In contrast, the total scattering is the sum of scattering
    coefficient of water β w (λ) , small particles β s (λ) , and large particle β
    l (λ) , respectively. The scattering function is wavelength and concentration-dependent.
    Therefore, total scattering can be calculated as [142], [146]–[148], β(λ)= β w
    (λ)+ β s (λ) C s + β l (λ) C l , (20) View Source where the small scale concentration
    C s and C l the concentration of large scale in g/ m 3 can be calculated as [145]
    C s = C l = 0.01739 C c exp[0.11631( C c C 0 c )]g/ m 3 , 0.76284 C c exp[0.03092(
    C c C 0 c )]g/ m 3 . (21) (22) View Source Another noticeable optical property
    concerning signal scattering is known as albedo scattering, which is the ratio
    of scattering signal loss to the total signal losses [144]. The albedo scattering
    number is formed as, ω 0 = (Scattering signals β(λ) )/(Total signal scattering
    c(λ) ). The albedo number shows a significant scale factor to measure absorptivity
    or scattering of water medium, which varies from 0.25 to 0.8 for clear ocean water
    to turbid coastal water. The scattering phenomenon is stated as the detected optical
    information in terms of angular, temporal, and polarization which causes the degradation
    in the number of photons at the receiver end. The cause of suspended CDOM and
    inorganic particles, the scattering coefficient may be termed as the function
    of the volumetric scattering function β v (VSF) over total angles (θ) as follows
    [149], β(λ)=2π ∫ π 0 β vsf (λ;θ)sin(θ)dθ. (23) View Source Moreover, the VSF is
    prescribed the normalization of β(λ) by the scattering phase function. Therefore,
    the spectral VSF coefficient β ¯ v (θ,λ ) is defined as follows, β ¯ v (θ,λ)=
    β v (λ,θ) β . (24) View Source Simultaneously, the optical beam propagated through
    the water channel and lost some fraction of its propagation energy in interaction
    with water molecules, number of biological substances, CDOM, etc. The are two
    signal-affecting mechanisms widely considered as absorption and scattering. The
    optical signals are severely affected by the channel turbidity due to the random
    fluctuation of the refraction index. F. Turbulence Turbulence is another cause
    of optical signal fading resulting from the random fluctuation in the refractive
    index. Plenty of valuable experimental results have recently been recorded in
    the open literature on characterizing underwater optical turbulence (UOT). In
    other words, turbidity is described as the varying changes in refractive index
    due to fluctuation of density, salinity, and pressure of underwater environment
    that affects optical signal propagation. It means the random variation in scintillation
    index induced turbidity in the channel environment. The consistency of oceanic
    turbulence occurs by wave current, physio-chemical properties of water, large,
    and small suspended particles. The wave currents are defined as weak to strong
    turbulence conditions based on Reynolds number. If Reynolds number ρ≤1000 , then
    water flow is considered laminar or steady flow, with the minimal fluctuation
    in scintillation index. Whether, if it is 1000 ≤ρ≤2000 , then the flow has shown
    uncertainty, which means weak turbulence channel conditions. In the case where
    Reynolds number 2000≤ρ exceeds 4000, then it is considered as heavy turbulence
    channel conditions. G. Affect of Noise in UWOC Noise is the factor that corrupts
    the signals, which directly affects the signal efficiency during communication.
    In UWOC, the noise occurs due to the reception of a random variation of photons
    propagation by transceivers. Different background noise sources are widely studied,
    such as quantum shot noise, optical-excess noise, optical background noise, photo-detector
    dark current noise, diffused extended background noise, background noise from
    sunlight, or other objects in the optical communication systems received at the
    receiver end. There are different types of noises in UWOC are recorded in existing
    literature [4], [5], [9], [150]. Optical Excess Noise: The communication setup
    should be more accurate and reliable for information transmission purposes. However,
    some irregularities or faults in the experimental setup causes falling transmission
    accuracy. Due to inaccuracy of the transceivers noise occurrence, the glitches
    happen and corrupt the received signals defined as excess optical noise. Background
    Noise: In contrast to this noise, background noise is considered black-body radiation;
    the refracted sunlight is responsible as the main source of background noise.
    This type of noise majorly interfered by the sunlight, limiting the optical system
    performance for tens of meters (mostly in the Euphotic zone). The noise contribution
    of total background environment in the literature is recorded as in [4], [5],
    [9], and [150]. The total background noise power in optical signal propagation
    is defined as follows [150], P BG = P B G sol + P B G black−body . (25) View Source
    For channel modeling, the background noise variance σ 2 BG =2qR P BG B , depends
    on electronic signal bandwidth B , power of solar background P B G sol , and electron
    charge q , respectively. Furthermore, P B G sol is expressed as, P B G sol = A
    R (πFOV ) 2 δλ T F L sol . (26) View Source In (26), the receiver aperture area,
    the optical filter transmissivity is presented by A R , and T F , respectively.
    However, the solar radiance also depends on down-welling irradiance E , underwater
    reflectance of down-welling irradiance R , the directional dependence of underwater
    radiance L f , diffuse attenuation coefficient K , and the underwater depth d
    . Therefore, the solar radiance L sol is expressed by (27) as follows, L sol =
    ER L f exp(−Kd) π . (27) View Source Furthermore, the noise power of a black-body
    irradiance expressed as P BG = 2h c 2 γ A R (πFOV ) 2 δλ T A T F (λ ) 5 [ e (hc/λkT)
    −1] , (28) View Source where c , h , k , and γ are described as the speed of light,
    the Plank constant, the Boltzmann constant and the radiant factor. Moreover, the
    signal transmission factor in underwater is defined as T A =exp(− τ 0 ) . Photo-Detector
    Dark Current Noise: The dark current noise is described and related to the photo-diode
    [35]. This type of noise occurs due to electrical current leakage from the photodetector.
    The variance of the dark current noise can be defined by (29), which is the function
    of electron charge q , the DC intensity I DC , and electronic bandwidth [150],
    σ 2 DC =2q I DC B. (29) View Source Current Shot Noise: This type of noise is
    generated while receiving the signals at the receiver end. If the signal power
    symbolized by P s , then the shot noise variance can be written as [10], σ 2 ss
    =2qr P s B. (30) View Source Thermal Noise: The random motion of electrons generates
    noise within the conductor medium due to a temperature rise. To model the thermal
    noise, if it considers The noise figure parameters F=4 , load resistance R l =100Ω
    , and equivalent temperature T e =290K are taken, then thermal noise variance
    given as [10], [150] σ 2 TH = 4k T e FB R l . (31) View Source In the UWOC system
    model, the sum of total noise variances is responsible for the system noise. Therefore,
    without any interference of optical signal, the noise variances of electrical
    current at the detector end is given as, σ 2 I = σ 2 TH + σ 2 DC + σ 2 BG + σ
    2 ss . (32) View Source SECTION IV. Transceivers for UVLC A. Transmitter and Transducer
    The function of optical transducers is to transform the modulated information
    into an optical or electrical or vice-versa signal pattern. The transducers are
    mounted on transceivers and fixed on a well-defined path for smooth signal propagation
    in an underwater medium. In another words, the transducers are designed to generate
    an optical signal from an electrical signal made from optical transmitters during
    optical beam propagation. On the other hand, an actuator can be used in UWOC [9]
    to generate the pulse of optical signal in electrical format at the receiver end.
    With the rapidly increasing interest in exploring aquatic media, UWOC plays a
    vital role in realizing a wide range of scientific, commercial, and coastal security
    applications. VLC is an alternative communication media as a UWOC implementation
    in the range of LEDs illuminating light sources. In UVLC, the transmitter transforms
    digital information into analog format over channel conditions. Generally, LEDs
    and LDs are used for signal transmission over high data rates and bandwidth. Another
    adhesive advantage is LED structure, where the photons are emitted spontaneously
    at different phases. In coherent radiation, the photons are stimulate by another
    photon that is radiated with phase correlation [151]. More precisely, LEDs excel
    as incandescent reliable light sources, power consumption devices, and efficient
    luminous tools. The LEDs efficiency operate 210 m/W more than the incandescent
    lamps efficiency [45]. The multi-functional transmitter-enabled LEDs emit light
    and information simultaneously with the optical dimming power this is most widely
    used; for efficient signal propagation while the optical transmitters do not use
    flickering phenomena. In a general aspect, the LEDs are designed for white-light
    emission sources and divided into two categories: blue and red-green-blue (RGB)
    emitting types of LEDs. Both types of LEDs emit different colors of light, as
    yellow-white light causes phosphorus polishing. Blue LEDs are considered more
    energy-efficient and widely use for light illuminating systems rather than blue
    LEDs. The blue-LEDs could achieve reliability for optical signal transmission
    by combining yellow color (RGBY). In optical beam propagation, the VLC link depends
    on the dimming or switching nature of LEDs. The optical sources are categorized
    as laser transmitter type or an LED type optical transmitter. Consequently, the
    laser type of technological sources quiet different and are used according to
    the application requirement. An argon-ion laser is a well-known laser transmitter
    suitable for converting electrical signals into an optical format [10]. A transducer
    assists in converting and then transmitting all maximum quantities of photons
    toward the receiver or other nodes. For optical signal modulation, different types
    of laser modulators are being used. In general, the laser modulator is designed
    for low data rates over long-distance signal propagation, [9]. Compared to laser
    modulators, LEDs are cheaper though they cover very short ranges. The arrangement
    of an LED array is designed in a hexagonal type pyramidal shape for high-intensity
    and long-distance optical beam propagation, as proposed in [148]. In this type
    of pyramidal LED array structure, a single lens is used to illuminate the LED.
    This structure must be very compact for the output signals. For the sake of a
    signal, the direction can be created by switching an intense beam towards the
    destination. B. Optical Receiver Optical receivers are the collection arrangements
    of all-optical signal transmission within a medium. In other words, receivers
    could be defined as the process of optical signal entities absorbed by the photodetector
    and the photons detection on its surface to generate an electrical signal called
    an optical receiver. The conversion process of photons energy into an electrical
    signal is performed through photoelectric effect. Otherwise stated, the received
    photons at the semiconductor junction diodes release either an electron or a hole.
    Subsequently, these released entities moved to the conductance and release their
    excessive energies [21]. The propagated optics are collected by a lens for the
    detection and demodulation process at the receiver end. A photo-sensor is used
    to convert optical signals for further analysis. Taking into account improving
    system performance, a photo-sensor is characterized as easily accessible, very
    cost-effective, robust, and small in size, along with the low current consumption
    [152]. To cope with these advantages, plenty of different types of photo-sensors
    are being used and summarized in recent surveys as [9], [152]. These photo-sensors
    are photo-resistors, phototransistors, photomultiplier tubes, avalanche photodiode
    (APD), p-n photodiodes, and a photon detector semiconductor, photo-sensors, and
    biologically-inspired quantum photo-sensors (BQP). PIN and avalanche photodiode
    (APD) are widely used as a photodetectors in optical communication [153]. SECTION
    V. Current Project Schemes on UVLC In this section, we provide the details of
    the most recent current project in underwater medium currently running worldwide.
    A wide detailed description are summarized in Table 6. Most recently, UNEXMIN
    project scheme [154] was launched and funded by the European Commission (EU) for
    3D mapping and more widely autonomous exploration of European flooded mines (AUEFM)
    during the period of 2016 – 2019. The main purpose of this project scheme was
    to develop a novel underwater robotic system for bathymetric, oceanographic, oceanic
    bathyscaphical data collection, and ocean exploration in 3D geographical imaging
    in real-time monitoring and video streaming. The Robotics Explorer is made by
    three robots named UX-1a, UX-1b, and UX-1c to adjoining for the purpose of valuable
    geological and mineralogical information collection. UX-1 is the first prototype
    was proposed to open the new technological lines and uncover mysterious challenges
    in this research project development. The first prototype was finished in April
    2018 and has been tested at the Kaatiala mine (Finnland), Idrija mine (Slovenia),
    during 2018, and later in Urgeirca mine (Portugal), Ecton mine (England), Molnar
    Janos cave (Hungary) during 2019. The Surf3DSLAM project [155] was coordinated
    by the University de Girona, Spain, and proposed an innovative research proposal
    for Probabilistic 3D Surface Matching for Bathymetry based Simultaneous Localization
    and Mapping (Surf3DSLAM) by deploying aquatic vehicles. The main challenges of
    this research project were navigation and detection of the exact position of the
    underwater vehicles. Further development of this project scheme proposed a remotely
    operated underwater vehicle (ROV) instead of AUV that supports low operational
    cost. The main objective of Surf3DSLAM was to accurately localize the ROVs and
    AUVs in 3D environmental space under the concept of simultaneous localization
    and mapping (SLAM). To associate SLAM within the 3D environment, the whole investigation
    was addressed as Surf3DSLAM. Surf3DSLAM framework mainly aimed to deploy AUVs
    for navigation purposes, replace other economical, efficient robotics vehicles,
    and further deploy for safe and precise surveys in an unguided aqueous environment.
    Most recently underwater activities are unveiling the mystery of occupied water
    territories and exploring natural mineral sources. Due to this, project scheme
    as Submarine Cultures Perform Long-Term Robotic Exploration of Unconventional
    Environmental (subCULTron) [156] was proposed and coordinated by the University
    Graz, Austria. This project was launched and aimed to achieve a long-lasting self-determination
    learning device, a self-configurable, self-maintainable underwater robotic tool
    in very high-impact-modified application areas in Italy. The main perspectives
    of this project are to develop a better quality of communication and energy harvesting
    among the underwater sensor nodes. The subCULTron is subdivided into few sections
    as the entitled project. The upper layer of sea surface in the proposed system,
    and the artificial objectives are introduced as the information collective robotic
    tools for long-run system exploration capabilities. The artificial robotic tool
    allows monitoring the marine environment, and the incredible natural oceanic environments,
    including biological materials such as algae, bacterium, and aquatic species.
    In contrast through subCULTron, a deployed artificial lily-pad on water surface
    communicates with human-culture and transmit energy along with the collected information
    from ship traffic. Apart from that, the artificial fish floats and exchanges information
    with mussels and lily-pad. The subCULTron is aimed to propose the real world for
    humans and animals in cohabitants of high impact such as venice canals and lagoon.
    Thus, the cultural evolution promotes a sub-culture development and an artificial
    society underwater along with the cultural services of human society over the
    water reservoir. The TRIDENT project scheme [157] formally known as Marine Robots,
    and Dexterous Manipulation for Enabling Autonomous Underwater Multipurpose Intervention
    Missions (MRDME-AUMIM) was proposed for multipurpose underwater challenges in
    highly turbid and complexity channel conditions. In other words, the development
    of novel methodology for marine robotics systems accommodates versatile dexterous
    adaption and the capabilities for operational activities in unguided underwater
    environments. This project scheme also has drawn attention to various specific
    skills in marine environments: navigation, bathymetric data, geographical mapping,
    vehicle-manipulator systems, dexterous manipulation, and the development of a
    wide range of intelligent control UWSNs architectural techniques. The project
    has been classified into two phases. In its first phase, the autonomous surface
    craft (ASC) is carried AUV towards the sector to be surveyed, while in the second
    phase, the assembly of ASC and AUV navigate the underwater targeted position.
    The latest project scheme [158] entitled Smart and Networking Under Water Robots
    in Cooperation Meshes (SWARMs) was funded by the EU and also coordinated by Universidad
    Politechnica de Madrid, succeeded to forward the extensive research of AUVs/ROVs
    to the next level. The further development of AUVs/ROVs research provides a solution
    to the threat of offshore industries. SWARM project aimed to expand a better utilization
    of robotics in underwater, various marine applications and offshore operations,
    which affects the assigned safety patterns and operational costs. The main attraction
    of the project research is to improve AUVs’ autonomy and enhance the usability
    of ROVs in the underwater environment. Moreover, no specialized underwater vehicles
    are required; instead of AUVs/ROVs work in a cooperative network; as a result,
    it opens the doors for new futuristic underwater applications. At a glance, the
    achievements of SWARM could be demonstrated in several testing sites and numerous
    applications such as inspection and water pollution monitoring. Oceans and seas
    are the source of life on earth and the most significant water source for humankind.
    Nevertheless, these water reservoirs are affected by human interactive activities.
    Therefore, exploring these massive water mediums are necessary by deploying artificial
    devices or robots, called marine robots. In general, the vitality of marine robotics
    technology is an enormous significance in an extensive range of functional underwater
    applications. These applications are mostly utilized to observe and monitor purpose
    and the life beneath the water surface, observation of water pollution, oil and
    gas rig observations, surveillance and coastal securities, fish farming, and early
    detection warning of natural disasters. Given this, an innovation of the project
    scheme Sibiu-HCEV [159], is introduced as the resolution of an intelligent hybrid
    high capacity electric underwater ROVs. The Sibiu-HCEV is an underwater floatable
    robot at different depths in an unguided water environment that is an innovative
    invention in underwater robotics technology to reduce risk to the capital expenditure
    (CAPEX) and operating expenditure (OPEX). Marine robotics industries are rapidly
    growing up to uncover the complexity of harsh oceanic environments. The marine
    robots have pulled back the curtains of the mysterious thesaurus of the deepest
    oceans. This underwater robotics industrial sector is a crucial, significantly
    cost-effective domain with considerable entry barriers to resources and developments.
    The project EUMarineRobots [160] is aimed to extend the underwater challenges
    into more depth, remotely operations, and in the very hostile marine environment.
    Additionally, the aim of EUMarineRobots are deploying for a full range of air
    and open international access to Europe. EUMarineRobots has an impressive research
    group from ten countries in marine robotics research infrastructure network. This
    network distinguishes the various technical infrastructures for diverse navigation
    beyond marine and in the marine robotic sectors. Since the early ages, underwater
    applications are based on acoustic links for long range communications. However,
    RF and optical waves are capable of supporting large bandwidth and high data rates
    but efficiently attenuated due to the physio-chemical vitality of the marine environment.
    The primary objectives of the project were recently proposed as UNDERWORLD [161]
    to re-evaluate the electromagnetic communication through UWSNs deployment for
    various underwater applications such as navigation, localization, natural disaster,
    detection of coral reefs, and coastal security purposes in real-time scenarios.
    This project aims to enhance industrialization in marine observatory systems,
    naval tactical operations, seaport management infrastructures, and underwater
    environmental monitoring. Moreover, underwater environmental monitoring in an
    aqueous medium is widely deployed with acoustic waves, but these applications
    apply in shallow waters such as rivers, dams, lakes, and remotely coastal areas.
    Throughout this project scheme. Another main contribution of this project is to
    improve the characteristics of antennas for two ways of communication among transceivers.
    Earthquakes, Tsunami, and floods are sudden natural events which occur due to
    an imbalance of water reservoirs and waves (water currents). These events are
    entirely impossible to control or prevent but can be detected earlier by deploying
    the sensors nodes or anchored architecture of UWSNs with the sea bottoms. The
    seismometers are used to sense the unacceptable seismic frequency at a standardized
    scale. These seismometers are highly detectable sensor nodes those capable for
    detecting and recording waves emitted by the most miniature earthquakes. It is
    far expensive to deploy seismometers at the ocean bottom to investigate water
    currents and seismic waves detection. Due to these issues, the novel project scheme
    funded by the EU entitled Ocean-DAS had recently proposed new tools for underwater
    seismology through ocean-bottom distributed acoustic sensors [162]. The main aim
    of Ocean-DAS is to develop a low-cost deployable alternatives for monitoring seismicity
    in remote areas of the oceans. The Ocean-DAS are enabled with the fiber optical
    wires for telecommunication which transforms the data into powerful seismic sensing
    arrays. Through the support of this opto-electronic unit, more than a 50km span
    could be monitored. The most recent project scheme is proposed entitled as Cooperative
    Underwater Surveillance Networks (COUSIN) funded by Engineering and Physical Sciences
    Research Council (EPSRC) [163] during 2021s to 2023s. The project scheme focuses
    on the underwater surveillance system for a specific country or region. The surveillance
    system is investigated for more precise benefits in various underwater applications
    in numerous fields such as pollution monitoring, coastal or harbor securities,
    import and export duties, human trafficking, smuggling, maintaining integrity,
    and detecting attacks on underwater infrastructure. The main expected contribution
    of this project scheme is to track, target and search for suspicious objects,
    and convey information to the base station for further investigation. The detectable
    target through this project scheme could be an artificial object such as UUV,
    surface vehicle, submarine, source of pollution, underwater species, active volcanos,
    oil & gas pipeline repaitment, ice objects, or divers, etc. Furthermore, surveillance
    and underwater monitoring are the main functions through the long-range acoustic
    link. For underwater geographical mapping and target detection, the SONAR waves
    are the key beneficial technologies while over the sea-surface detection, radio
    detection and ranging (RADAR) are the most widely used. The main objective of
    COUSIN is to design a low-cost underwater acoustic network to improve the underwater
    monitoring and surveillance system capabilities. The current ongoing project scheme
    entitled Technologies for Ocean Sensing (TechOceanS) [164] funded by the European
    Commission (EC) and coordinated by the National Oceanography Center, UK. TechOceanS
    is organized by the research group of ten universities in Europe. The oceans are
    affected by human beings by flushing and trashing unwanted decomposable materials
    such as plastics that are threatening to harm underwater species. Due to human
    activities direct and indirect involvement in the underwater environment, the
    ice caps melt, and the water level rises. Therefore, an urgent need to deploy
    an advanced ocean observational technology through resistance to extract the decompose
    plastic materials. At first glance, the project has developed the scheme to monitor
    and observe ocean biology, chemical composition changes, and plastic monitoring
    through underwater vehicles nine pioneering technologies. The proposed novel solution
    by TechnOceanS is comprised of a group of five sensors; the two sensors are used
    for imaging data collection of the specified seabed, marine biology, and plastics.
    A sampler is used to collect thousands of particle samples for further analysis
    and the rest of use for a new artificial intelligence (AI)- based image processing
    method for data compression and information transmission. The most recent proceeding
    project scheme established for Long Distance Underwater Wireless Optical Communication
    System using Visible Light Laser Array with Directivity Control Function (LD-UWC-VLC-LADCF)
    [165], and funded by Japan Society for the Promotion Science (JSPS). The purpose
    of this scheme is to improve the quality of visible light signaling over long
    ranges in the underwater environment. In this research perspective, the main two
    challenges are extending the transmission distance in gigabit-class with high-speed
    UWOC. The first point is the verification of the effect of distance extension
    while multiple visible light laser are propagated propagating in a high turbid
    water medium. Secondly, the construction of a light beam in a particular direction
    through evaluating the experimental data available. TABLE 6 The Latest Underwater
    Communication Project Schemes are Currently Running All Around the World. Additionally,
    the Future Directions and the Most Significant Contribution in the Scientific
    Community, Underwater Applications, and the Results of the Corresponding Project
    Schemes are Summarized SECTION VI. Computational Methods Nowadays, solving complex
    and huge data-based problems are typically possible without a real experimental
    setups. This is achieved through simulation-enabled computer science and engineering
    methodologies. Moreover, computational engineering methods support automaticity,
    design, and optimization of the complex problems. Therefore, the computational
    research methods provide the new advancements investigating the mythologies in
    computing such as algorithms, models, simulations, and system performances in
    order to understand the complexity of social, biological, technological, and everlasting
    patterns and their behaviors [166]. These computational research methodologies
    provide a solution for better understanding of random behavior of the system as
    follows: Automatically categorization and information extraction of the selected
    data-sets; Differentiate a bulk data into a specific group and particular level
    for the analysis; The system design and model of the emergence of new behaviors
    from individual-level interactions; A detailed explanation of emergence of a system
    network; Recognizes and refrigerates the thresholds within a complex system; Classifies
    and finds a the pattern within the massive data-sets for further analysis by using
    other techniques; Identify meaningful structural patterns within the webs of relationships.
    In more detail, computational engineering methodologies are defined as the development
    and exploitation of more realistic computational models. As a result, the computational
    engineering methodology opens new perspectives and challenges of more sophisticated
    key problems of huge data structures. Additionally, computational methodologies
    are numerically mathematical and depends heavily on computer architectural system.
    It means that the numerical efficiency should be achieved by extracting the maximum
    amount of correct information from the minimum number of grid points, as well
    as establishing a linear proportionality between the incoming time and the unknown
    number. Due to this, several computational approaches are studied in this study
    as follows. A. Monte-Carlo Computational Method The probabilistic format of the
    computational method is widely known as the Monte-Carlo simulation. In UWOC, this
    computational method is used to track the number of photons emitted by an optical
    source within the underwater medium. A high bandwidth underwater optical communication
    channel by utilizing Monte-Carlo simulation is widely discussed in [167]. The
    simulation approach of photons propagation is rigorous within turbid medium, in
    a more detailed description, Monte-Carlo simulation computational methods are
    used to provide the specific details of the propagated photons geometry as mentioned
    in [168] and [169]. Generally, the optical signals propagation depends on the
    medium waves. This is an alternative computational approach to eliminate the unbounded
    error growth in co-variance equation computationally as described in [170]. B.
    Numerical Modeling of Wave Propagation As aforementioned, that the optical beam
    spreads in an underwater medium and depends on the water flow (channel conditions).
    The different types of water flow have been categorized and summarized according
    to the flow pattern in [171]. Laminar flow is defined as where the fluid particles
    move along in a well-defined path and each water layer slides smoothly over the
    adjacent layer. While the turbulent flow is defined as the zig-zag flow pattern
    of water particles. The laminar flow changes into turbulent flow if the Reynold’s
    number is more than that 4000. The Reynold’s condition satisfies as laminar flow
    below 2000, otherwise turbulent flow [172]. Due to this, the optical beam propagation
    experiences a huge loss due to turbulence, signal absorption, and scattering by
    the suspended particles within the medium. Therefore, the necessity is to model
    the turbulence channel. Moreover, a numerical method for free surface flow that
    builds for nonlinear shallow water equation and utilizes a non-hydro-static pressure
    term to describe short waves are presented in [173]. C. Beer Lambert’s Law Computational
    methods are employed as the most significant solution for optical signaling in
    underwater mediums. An ordinary simulation method is widely employs for optical
    signaling in an aqueous medium known as Beer Lambert’s law. This law is described
    the optical signal attenuation due to the existence of suspended particles underwater.
    It is mathematically defined as the function of optical received signal power,
    the Euclidean distance apart from the transceivers, and the extinction coefficient
    of the medium. This type of channel model is used for optical signaling for any
    type of water availability, especially, for path loss fading. The mathematical
    expression of Beer Lambert’s law is shown below: P r (λ,d)= P t exp−c(λ)d, (33)
    View Source where P r and P t are denoted as the received and transmitted optical
    signal strength at the receiver and transmitter ends. Also, the extinction coefficient
    c(λ) is the sum of total optical signal absorption and scattering which are the
    optical wavelength dependents. The experimental values of extinction coefficient,
    for the readers references are widely discussed in [5], [82], [84], [86], and
    [174]. Additionally, due to transceivers physical parameters, geometrical losses
    are also considered for diffused LDs and semi-collimated light sources LEDs. Therefore,
    the modified Beer-Lambert law is the function of path loss ( h pl ) and geometrical
    losses ( h gl ) are given as [101], h l ≈ = h pl + h gl , ( D r θ F ) 2 d −2 t
    exp(−c ( D r θ F ) τ d 1−τ t ). (34) View Source The contributed channel condition
    coefficient h l in terms of path loss and geometrical losses are presented in
    (34). In (34), the receiver aperture diameter D r , full-width transmitter beam
    divergence angle θ F , and correction coefficient τ are defined. According to
    [101], the maximum achievable distance between communication nodes to obtain the
    BER performance of the vertically point-point system is given as follows, d= ⎡
    ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ W( c 2 (1−T))( D R θ 1/e ) ( 1 Q(BER) 2 σ 2 n P t r 2 η 2 − − − −
    − √ ) ( T−1 2 ) c 2 (1−T) ( D R θ 1/e ) T ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ 1 1−T . (35) View Source
    where W , Q , η , and T are defined as the Lambert-W function, error function,
    electrical to optical conversion efficiency, and correction coefficient. D. Radiative
    Transfer Differential Theory and Computational Method Radiative transfer theory
    (RTE) deals with computing derivatives of radiometric measures with respect to
    desired visual of geometrical parametrization, and facilitates the gradient-based
    optimization in various applications [175]. Additionally, the RTE is deployable
    in neutron transportation, astrophysics, and biomedical image analysis [175],
    [176]. Furthermore, the energy conservation-based radio transfer theory is used
    to model the optical waves in participating media. For better RTE understanding
    the assumptions are made, if considers the test volume V⊆ R 3 with the corresponding
    boundary ∂V , and the interior radiance field L(s,ω) is defined over the position
    s∈V/∂V , and light-transport directions ω∈ S 2 . Then, the RTE equation given
    as follows [175], L=( K T K C + K S )L+ L (0) , (36) View Source where, K T ,
    K C , and K S are denoted as the transport operator, collision operator, and interfacial
    scattering operator, respectively. Additionally, the Reynolds transport theorem
    is also an alternative method to solve computational problems. The Reynolds theorem
    for f scalar value function is defined for n -dimensional manifold ω parameterized
    with some π∈R as (37). If it is an assumption that Γ(π)⊂V(π) be an (n−1) dimensional
    manifold given by the union of the external boundary ∂V(π) and the internal one
    containing the discontinuous locations of f . Then, Reynold’s theorem could be
    specified as follows [177], ∂ π ( ∫ V(π) fdV(π)) = ∫ V(π) f ˙ dV(π)+ ∫ Γ(π) <n,
    x ˙ >Γ(π). (37) View Source Furthermore, f ˙ := ∂ π , x ˙ := ∂ π x , dV and dΓ
    denotes the standard measures associated with V and Γ0 ; Moreover <⋅,⋅> indicated
    the dot (inner product between two vectors.) Furthermore, n is the normal direction
    at each x∈Γ(π) . E. The Data Assimilation Algorithms for Numerical Models The
    data assimilation refers to the procedure of incorporating data into a model simulation
    to improve the upcoming predictions. The predictions of the system behavior can
    be defined by the measurement of the physically numerical based model. More specifically,
    the system should be more simplified for a better understanding of computational
    methods. In many applications, the data assimilation approaches are accurate to
    describe the dynamic behavior of the system. Utilizing the data assimilation techniques
    the measurement and model outcomes are used to obtain an optimal estimation of
    the state of the system. However, the main hurdles in advanced data assimilation
    schemes are the bulky computational load that is required for solving a real problem.
    On the other hand, the assimilation algorithm is an essential tool to obtain efficient
    variational data for further analysis. Due to this, More accurate data assimilation
    methods are variational data assimilation and Kalman filtering computational method
    is widely used. Data assimilation for minimization computational method widely
    discussed in [178] as follows, X k+1 =f( X k ,p,k)+B(k,p) u k , X 0 = x 0 (38)
    View Source where X k is the system state, u k is the input of the system, f is
    a nonlinear function, p is a vector containing the uncertain parameters, and B(k)
    is an input matrix. Besides, the Kalman filter assimilation computational method
    could be written as, X k+1 =F(k) X k +B(k) u k +G(k) W k , (39) View Source where
    the Gaussian noise process is denoted by W k with zero mean and covariance matrix
    Q(k) and G(k) is the noise input matrix. SECTION VII. UVLC Channel Modelling Modeling
    of UWOC channel leads to a better understanding of optical signal propagation
    and supports exploring aqueous mediums. UVLC is considered an alternative communication
    media to meet the requirements in high data rate, large bandwidth, and high communication
    speed to deploy in various underwater applications. Moreover, for long ranges
    UVLC communication, the necessity is to design a system for efficient signal transmission.
    Generally, the signal absorption reduces the signal strength that is attenuated
    in the transmitted signal. Despite that, the scattering phenomena is responsible
    for the optical beam deflection from its initial position, this contributes to
    signal fading. As a result, Monte-Carlo simulation is being used, which is an
    alternative approach to deal with the statistical methodology for the evaluation
    of channel characteristics by generating a number of random photons and further
    obtained the simulation performance interaction of each photon within the medium
    [179]. Optical signal propagation is categorized into two main streams based on
    the type of detection techniques. They are: non-coherent intensity modulation
    and direct detection (IM/DD) signal modulation technique. However, the IM/DD is
    generally used as an optical signal modulation scheme to decode information at
    the receiver. In non-coherent systems, the detector directly detects information
    through emitted light. Another aspect of the signal detection technique is the
    coherent detection, where a local oscillator (LO) is being used to mix optical
    signals before detection which improves the receiver sensitivity [180]. In more
    contrast, coherent and heterodyne detection techniques are widely discussed as
    in [29]. A local oscillator uses incoherent detection scheme which comprises of
    the received signal to the carrier beam detected by the photodetector. Furthermore,
    the coherent detection scheme is also sub-categorized into two main classes as
    heterodyne and homodyne detection [21]. The LO operates as the same frequency
    with the optical signal in the homodyne detection scheme, while the frequency
    could be different in the heterodyne detection scheme. In the VLC setup, the system
    consists of an optical transmitter for signal modulation by LED illumination phenomena.
    On the other hand, a receiver enables a photosensitive diode for the decoding
    process from the detected light power. The block diagram consists of a transmitter
    and a receiving system depicted by Fig. 8. The different approaches use to model
    the undersea VLC system. A. Oceanic Turbulence Channel Modeling The most influential
    optical signal phenomenon is channel turbidity. Turbulence occurs due to random
    fluctuation in the refractive index of the water medium caused by the variation
    in temperature and salinity. Therefore, turbulence phenomena affects the performance
    of optical signal propagation in an aqueous medium. The affecting performance
    and channel modeling of highly turbid water mediums are presented in existing
    literature [100], [102], [181]–[183]. The fluctuation in the refractive index
    is directly related to the nature of the water channel as a function of temperature,
    salinity, pressure, and density. Due to increasing underwater depth, the temperature
    decreases and pressure increases; nevertheless, the water is slightly compressible
    affecting highly pressurized and dense water environments. Taking into account
    underwater turbulence, the scintillation index ( σ 2 I ) leads turbidity which
    is the main cause of optical signal fading. In more detail, the broad study of
    modified underwater optical turbulence (UOT) model is investigated mathematically
    by (40), as shown at the bottom of the next page, Show All [184]. As stated UOT
    spectrum model in (40), where κ , ϵ and C 0 , C 1 is defined the magnitude of
    the spatial frequency, dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy per unit mass
    of fluid and fluid constants, respectively. Moreover, Kolmogorov micro-scale length
    η is represented ratio of kinematic viscosity ( ν ) and ϵ . The dissipation rate
    of mean-squared refractive index χ n , the thermal expansion coefficient α , and
    saline contraction coefficients are given as, χ n = α 2 χ T + β 2 χ S −2αβ χ TS
    . (41) View Source Considering plane and spherical wave models of scintillation
    index ( σ 2 I ) for different Gaussian beams are widely discussed in [185]–[187].
    However, the scintillation index is defined as the variance of the received signal
    normalized intensity I , which is expressed in [8], σ 2 I = ⟨ I 2 ⟩− ⟨I⟩ 2 ⟨I
    ⟩ 2 . (42) View Source As varying scintillation index causes heavy turbulence,
    that can be highly affect of optical signal propagation. It means the more unsatisfactory
    performance of the system and degrades the system efficiency. Various existing
    works are recorded to channel models in weak and heavy turbidity channel conditions.
    In existing research, plenty of statistical channel models under weak turbulence
    intensity fluctuation and mathematically are defined PDFs for turbulence. The
    experimental model under lognormal distribution is mentioned as in [100], [188]–[190].
    Therefore, the probability density function (PDF) of turbulence channel condition
    under lognormal distribution is given as follows, f I (I)= exp(− (ln(I)−2 μ n
    ) 2 8 χ 2 n ) 8π χ 2 n h 2 − − − − − − √ . (43) View Source In spite of strong
    turbulence channel conditions, UVLC channel model into successive j th number
    of water layers, and following Gamma-Gamma (GG) distribution model is proposed
    as in [33] and [114], f I j ( I j )=2 ( α j β j ) ( α j + β j ) 2 Γ( α j )Γ( β

    kind are denoted by Γ(⋅) and K ( α j − β j ) (⋅) , respectively. The PDF in (44),
    for normalization conditions it satisfies the equality of turbulence channel coefficient
    as E{ I J } 2 =1. Besides of it, the scintillation index for GG distribution is
    given as [191], σ 2 I j = 1 α j + 1 β j + 1 α j β j . (45) View Source Furthermore,
    under-consideration of j th vertical water layers, the large and small scale factors
    for the plane wave model are defined by α j and β j respectively. The α j and
    β j can be written as follows [33], [183], α j = β j = ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ exp ⎛ ⎝ ⎜
    ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ 0.49 χ 2 I j (1+1.11 χ 12 5 I j ) 7 6 ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ −1 ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ −1

    the scintillation index which is known as Rytov variance [102]. Consequently,

    β k = ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ exp ⎛ ⎝ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ 0.49 χ 2 I k (1+0.18 d 2 +0.56 χ 12 5 I

    ≫1 depends for large scale cells for plane wave model while χ 2 I k ≪1 for small
    scale cells. However, in (46) and (47) the Rytov variance is modeled [184, Eq.

    dependent along with δ = 1.5 C 2 1 (κη ) 45 + C 3 1 (κη ) 2 , respectively. B.
    Pointing Errors and Non-LOS Communication Link Pointing error is another issue
    in optical signal propagation that contributes to the signal fading in the underwater
    environment. Due to the random water current flow and movement of floating nodes,
    a uniform constant tracking pointing system necessary to maintain for a reliable
    communication link. Generally, the pointing error is defined and considered with
    the two essential categories as bore-sight and jitter [195]. For more detail,
    in [195] the authors are defined the bore-sight determines on a stable displacement
    transceiver (between detector center and the beam center), whereas jitter is the
    random displacement process between of beam center at the detector plane [196].
    Under consideration of Gaussian beam model for jitter phenomenon, if the optical
    beam propagates through the distance z between the source and destination along
    with the collected beam at the detector end with beam radius a . Then, the collected
    power at the receiver is given as [100], [195] [197], h p (R;z)≈ A p exp(− 2 R

    at the receiver that could be further expressed as R= R 2 x + R 2 y − − − − −

    of the collected power is denoted by A p at R=0 . The fraction of the collected

    h ζ 2 −1 p ,0≤ h p ≤ A p (52) View Source where the ratio of equivalent beam radius
    with pointing error displacement standard deviation at the receiver end is presented
    by ζ= Ω 2 σ s . On the other hand, if neglecting the pointing error, then the
    observation the misalignment of the transceivers is modeled by utilizing the beam
    spread function (BSF) as [85]. SECTION VIII. Modulation, Demodulation, and Channel
    Coding Techniques for UVLC VLC signal modulation is totally different from terrestrial-based
    communication cause of non-encoding features in phase, and amplitude [198]. In
    general, the accomplishment of LEDs in the VLC system has triple features as illumination,
    high-speed data communication, and energy harvesting simultaneously [27]. The
    Maximum Flickering Time-Period (MFTP) of the light should be minimized for the
    minimal flickering phenomena [31]. On the other hand, the dimming process control
    of light supports the potential energy conservation purposes [31]. Generally,
    VLC modulation techniques deploy under IM/DD, and coherent modulation (CM) based
    scheme, which is further classified as a single carrier modulation (SCM), multi-carrier
    modulation (MCM), and color domain-based modulation (CDBM) schemes [3]. The various
    type of VLC modulation schemes are summarized by the Table 7. Moreover, the pictorial
    classification of VLC modulation techniques is depicted by Fig. 9. It is noteworthy
    that IM/DD modulation schemes are less suitable for high-data-rate applications
    [21]. For that reason, there is an alternative option Mach-Zehnder Modulator (MZM)
    which is used to modulate the intensity of the continuous optical waves and widely
    use for laser beams propagation [199]. Although the CM scheme offers more advantages
    over IM/DD enabled system in detection performance and minimize the background
    noise, the better sensitivity of the receiver, low cost, and complexity to install
    setup [200]. Modulation schemes are the most critical ways to expand bandwidth,
    such as OOK, pulse position modulation (PPM), and pulse width modulation (PMW)
    have advantages regarding system complexity when using to enhance the performance
    of the VLC system. However, the Discrete Multitone (DMT) modulation, OFDM modulation,
    and Carrier-less Amplitude Phase (CAP) modulation have better spectral efficiency
    [27]. TABLE 7 Consider the Underwater Optical Modulation Techniques, the Single
    Carrier Modulation Scheme (SCM), and Color Shift Keying (CSK) are Summarized in
    This Table. The Research Objectives, Design System Model, and Future Directions
    are Also Briefly Described A. Single Carrier Modulation Scheme In SCM, the communication
    setup leads to improve channel capacity. Nevertheless, the system complexity is
    increased due to the cost factor. The IM/DD setups have several benefits as easy
    to install, very cost-effective, and less complex as compared with the coherent
    system. The photo-detectors are used to convert optical signals into electrical
    signals under IM/DD technique. As the dimming process is widely noticed in optical
    signaling consequently, several dimming processes have been proposed in [201].
    Furthermore, the PPM, DMT, and OOK are also proposed to accommodate dimming phenomena
    [202]. Generally, for regular system model design, signal carrier modulation (SCM)
    schemes are widely used. In consideration of SCM- IM/DD, several modulation techniques
    are investigated such as OOK, PAM, variable pulse position modulation (VPPM) and
    differential pulse position modulation (DPPM) pulse position modulation (PPM),
    pulse width modulation (PWM) and color shift keying (CSK), etc., [21], [27] and
    are mentioned in Table 7. B. OOK Modulation Scheme Under Consideration IM/DD IM/DD
    scheme is well known and easy to install, and a cost-effective signal propagation
    scheme. In this scheme, the signals have to propagate through the source directly
    or by the external modulator. Despite the receiver side, the signal information
    is demodulated through the direct detection process; therefore, the whole system
    is named as intensity-modulation & direct-detection. An ordinary process to modulate
    optical signal information through light and the intensity regulated by the OOK
    scheme. The illumination of LEDs are turned “off” and “on” phenomena according
    to the bit-stream as the digital numbers “0” and “1” [27]. Such as the presence
    and absence pulse phenomena of light intensity depending on the bit duration.
    The LEDs are not completely turned off in the “off states”; nevertheless, the
    signal intensity level decreases in this state. The OOK scheme uses and is divided
    into the pulse format with a return to zero (RZ) and without a return to zero
    (NRZ), [29]. In a more vast discussion, the format contains the digital bits “1”
    in NRZ while the RZ format occupies the remaining parts of the bits represented
    by “0”. The performance of the OOK modulation technique severely degrades and
    can be improved by updating the higher modulation schemes as followed in Table
    7. C. Pulse Modulation Schemes Aforementioned, the OOK modulation technique is
    an essential signal modulation scheme that supports low data rates with low performances.
    Pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) is more tolerant of the effect of the multi-path
    channel as mentioned in [27]. PAM modulation scheme is the process where the message
    is encoded in terms of amplitude of the optical pulse. Despite the PAM scheme,
    OOK is recorded as widely used under consideration of IM/DD optical communication
    scheme because of its simplicity and resilience to the intrinsic nonlinearities
    of laser origin. Even, in pulse position modulation (PPM) scheme, the division
    of symbol k is transmitted into an equal time slot within the 2 M constellation
    symbol M . A single pulse in PPM scheme during each symbol period suffers from
    low data-rate [45]. To cope up with this issue in PPM, a pulse width modulation
    (PWM) scheme is investigated as in [231], where it deals with dimming control
    cause of lower intensity control and varies with the pulse width proportion of
    the instantaneous values of the signals. Therefore, for multi-pulse in each symbol-time
    transmission the multi-pulse modulation (M-PPM) scheme was proposed [29]. On the
    other hand, in [3], authors comprised as PAM required more power for large bandwidth
    while PPM suffers low spectral efficiency. Continuously developing of optical
    pulse modulation schemes, a differential pulse position modulation (DPPM) scheme
    is introduced to improve the overall throughput spectral efficiency of PPM [232].
    However, the DPPM is based on a very short pulse duration width for an alternative
    signal propagation. Due to this, the combination of DPPM and PWM in the form of
    DPWM has achieved a higher bandwidth efficiency than PPM and OOK. The most significant
    advantage of DPWM is that it solves the narrow pulse problem and has low power
    efficiency. To control the brightness of the LED in the PPM scheme, a Variable
    PPM (VPPM) is proposed as in [233]. However, the VPPM combines PWM and 2-PPM,
    which control the brightness and data transmission along with the controlling
    dimming level to flickering position. As a result, the multiple Pulse Position
    Modulation (MPPM) has gained a more power-efficient scheme than OOK, PAM, and
    PPM. Taken into an account of optimum power and bandwidth efficiency, a hybrid
    Multiple Pulse Amplitude and Position Modulation (MPAPM) signal propagation scheme
    is proposed in [234]. However, an Overlapping Pulse Position Modulation (OPPM)
    [235] is proposed for improving bandwidth efficiency and high data-rate in MPPM.
    Utilizing VPPM for data transmission, the system offers complexity; an alternative
    approach, a Variable Rate Multi-pulse Modulation (VR-MPPM) [233], is investigated
    to cope with the complex issues to achieve both data rate and brightness control
    simultaneously. Furthermore, an expurgated PPM (E-PPM) modulation scheme is proposed
    to improve the performance of a peak-power limited M-ary communication system
    mentioned in Table 7. D. Color Domain Based Shift Keying (CSK) Modulation Color
    Phase Shift Keying (CSK) is defined by VLC IEEE 802.15.7 standard to improve system
    performance compared with other modulation schemes [45]. The IEEE standards for
    the CSK scheme are categorized into three sub-categories based on data rates known
    as PHY-I operates 11.67 to 266.6 kb/s, PHY-II operates on 1.25 to 96 Mb/s and
    PHY-III that is operated on 12 to 96 Mb/s [31]. CSK modulation is the color space
    chromaticity dependent on utilizing the three colors intensities as Green, Red,
    and Blue LED of the source. The main principle of multi-color LED is the color
    shift keying where the VLC beam implemented as 4-CSK, 8-CSK, and 16-CSK modulation
    schemes light sources. The 3-Color CSK [210] and 4-CSK modulation schemes are
    proposed based on IEEE 802.15.7 standard [211]. The different CSK modulation schemes
    have been proposed in [236]–[238] and Table 7. E. Coherent & Multi-Carrier Modulation
    Techniques Despite IM/DD modulation scheme, the coherent scheme employs both phase
    and amplitude signals to modulate corresponding information. A local oscillator
    is used to convert the optical signals at the receiver end, which are referred
    to homodyne and hetrodyne detection mechanism. As a result, the coherent modulation
    scheme supports a high spectral efficiency and background noise resistivity but
    more channel complexity. However, multi-carrier modulation schemes are followed
    OFDM, where orthogonal sub-carriers are used as data transmission. A particular
    fading channel is converted into a flat fading channel as in the OFDM technique
    and using as a single tap equalizer. The different types of OFDM-based optical
    modulation schemes are proposed in open literature [239], [240]. The various multi-carrier
    modulation schemes are summarized in Table 7. The signals are converted from parallel
    format into serial ones for demodulation by using IFFT and then further transmitting
    to the LED transmitter. At the receiver end, the signal demodulation process happens
    by photo-diode (PD). Several multi-carrier modulation techniques are discussed
    in further Tables and subsections. DCO-OFDM:- Generally, OFDM uses RF communication
    which cannot be directly accessible to use in VLC because of the real and unipolar
    values of optical signals [241]. Therefore the conversion is needed; firstly,
    the bipolar signals are transformed into unipolar format and then the non-positive
    integers should be clipped. Generally, the RF-OFDM signals are converted into
    optical-OFDM by the Hermitian symmetry method. In contrast, the DC-bias converts
    into bipolar OFDM, which is known as DCO-OFDM. The mathematical expression of
    DC bias is given as [241], B DC =μ E{x(t ) 2 } − − − − − − − √ , (53) View Source
    where DC bias is defined by B DC of 10 log 10 ( μ 2 +1) dB. The proportionality
    constant and standard deviation of unclipped signals are represented by μ and
    E{x(t ) 2 } − − − − − − − √ , respectively. On the other hand, the expression
    for clipping operation can be written as follows [241], x(t)={ x 0 (t), 0, if  x
    0 (t)>0 if  x 0 (t)≤0. View Source The continuous development of LED carries new
    trends in optical communication. It is obvious that in DCO-OFDM, the power efficiency
    decreases while the modulation sequence increases. This makes it less compatible
    with several VLC applications. Therefore, a substitutional modulation technique
    is required. The novel substitutional technique is investigated only heterogeneous
    subcarriers for operation and also removes subcarriers known as ACO-OFDM [213].
    In contrast, the drawback of ACO-OFDM spectral efficiency is that half of DCO-OFDM
    causes half of the subcarriers rejection. PAM-DMT [221] has become an alternative
    methodology based on Fourier transform properties. In PAM-DMT, the real part of
    the signals is ignored while considering the imaginary values of the received
    signals. Moreover, for unipolar OFDM, the Flip-OFDM was also proposed [230]. The
    recently proposed Flip-OFDM technique is classified into two classes. In this
    classification, the second class is the replica of the original one. It means
    both of the classes contain the equivalency under DC bias-based modulation techniques.
    Therefore, in DCO-OFDM, the spectral efficiency falls up to half rather than ACO-OFDM.
    F. Hybrid Modulation Techniques In optical signaling, long distances coverage
    is challenging. For covering, long-range communication hybrid links are the key
    solution approaches for further wireless communication and mentioned in Table
    4 and Table 4. A single LED is used to transmit the signal in the further development
    of hybrid links instead of multiple arrays of LEDs. To deal with the issues in
    hybrid communication, spatial optical OFDM (SO-OFDM) is proposed. The SO-OFDM
    has received better BER performance than DCO-OFDM [241]. On the contrary, the
    reverse polarity optical OFDM (RPO-OFDM) is also introduced to control LED illumination
    in the VLC system [227]. The combined PWM technique deals with the real values
    in optical OFDM to control dimming phenomena in the VLC system. SECTION IX. Optical
    Energy Harvesting (OEH) The integration of IoTs, is a novel approach for wireless
    signaling in an underwater environment through IoUTs [70]. Optical waves can carry
    information and transfer energy simultaneously to power up the batteries of communication
    nodes. Even, to deploy an underwater communication setup is much more challenging
    than terrestrial-based communication. Therefore, the UVLC techniques are the potential
    wireless candidates for communication and energy transmitting media within the
    communication networks. Due to this, simultaneously, light-wave information and
    power transfer (SLIPT) has been proposed as a potential wireless candidate for
    communication and power transmission through optical link connectivity [242].
    Compared with simultaneous wireless information and power transmission (SWIPT),
    SLIPT performs better in specific channel condition requirements. This section
    provides an overview of SLIPT methodology through time, power, and spatial space
    dependency. Moreover, the LEDs are capable of transmitting signals in underwater
    environments with conveniently low-cost rather than RF signaling [20]. Internet-connected
    devices are the power-hungry tools those need to harvest energy being in an active
    mode. WPT is quite challenging among wireless nodes, specifically underwater.
    Although this, WPT has gained research attention in the most recent years [41],
    [243]–[245]. Initially, the idea of WPT came up during the 1890s [246]. Later
    on, the integration of WPT was triggered by SWIPT, where only electromagnetic
    waves carry information and power in different required application scenarios.
    SWIPT has become a futuristic digital energy transmitting technology in the wireless
    communication domain. However, RF-energy harvesting (RF-EH) systems experienced
    major technical problems due to transceiver circuits and suffered from relatively
    low efficiency. It is noteworthy that EM waves propagate over few meters in the
    underwater environment. Consequently, to get rid of the radiation rate of EM waves,
    it is replaced by VLC enabled light sources such as laser diode and LEDs. A hybrid
    RF and light-wave power transfer scheme with the color diversity of optical beam
    has been recorded in [247]. The authors in [247], are proposed a novel RF-VLC
    ultra-small cell network and the proposed system model consists of multiple terminal
    devices along with an optical angle-diversity transmitter with a multi-antenna
    RF access point. For shallow water communication, the fading of the optical signal
    due to the limited sunlight or background light effect is the leading cause of
    EH harvesting efficiency. SLIPT methodology can be a complementary energy harvesting
    (EH) approach to transfer energy via visible light in IoUT networking system.
    For instance, the RF/VCL hybrid communication and EH scheme is proposed in [248],
    where the authors designed a VLC link to harvest energy at the relay and furthered
    this harvested energy by transferring it with the base station through an RF link.
    However, a more sophisticated optical transceivers setup is required in the SLIPT
    scenario based on modulation and demodulation schemes, including the time, power,
    and space splitting format. A. Switching Technologies As the main concern of the
    SLIPT scenario, the switching technique has played the most significant role in
    transmission power and simultaneously information transmission. Generally, time,
    power, and space switching schemes are proposed in the open literature [249].
    In the time switching aspect, the receiver acts to decode information in the time
    slot t , whether the reaming time slot (1−t) is assigned for the harvesting energy.
    Furthermore, the received signals split into photo-voltaic and photo-conductive
    modes of receiving as well as decoding the signals. In addition, the low-power
    hybrid system can perform the function of switching between two solar cell modes
    in the cooperative communication aspect. While in power splitting mode, the receiving
    terminal self charges and detects the incident light beam information. The light
    beam splits into dual power factors as α and ( 1−α ), respectively. The power
    factor Pα is responsible for EH; else remaining power fraction P(1−α) is assigned
    for information decoding. In this power splitting scenario, the power splitting
    component could function passively; the reason is splitting the incident beam
    divides into two portions. Nevertheless, in this scenario, it is considering n
    th number of transceivers in a communication system and functioning for energy
    harvesting capabilities and information decoding. In this type of system architecture,
    the spatial splitting approach applicable. In this anticipated system design,
    each transmitter node is independent of each others and could transmit the signal
    and energy received by each receiving node. Furthermore, the time switching SPLIT
    approach could be utilized within this scenario for the same receiver, which acts
    as “Energy Harvester” and “Signal Decoder” over different periods. These two switching
    techniques would be beneficial to deploy in critical environments such as undersea
    and underground communication and wireless energy transfer. For long-range communication,
    the UWSNs are deployed within a particular depth in an undersea environment. Being
    in an active mode of sensor networks to replace the batteries and transfer energy
    wirelessly is quite challenging. To cope up with this issue, a novel hybrid SWIPT
    and SLIPT wireless power transfer techniques are investigated [247]. RF and light-wave
    power transfers are complement to each other in their relative profits and losses
    during signal propagation. An alternatively switchable process towards the 5GB
    wireless network to transfer power in shallow waters over moderate depth in underwater
    mediums is summarized in this section. SWIPT and SLIPT are the EH utility process
    where signal energy is converted into usable electric energy. An EH-system harvests
    the energy from nature such as solar energy, wind, rising temperature, and vibrational
    EH approaches are recorded in [250]. As, we are surrounded by an electronic world,
    embedded devices, remote sensors, and low-power electronic devices are necessarily
    required for power transfer and batteries to store the electrical capacity. Due
    to the limitations of the battery lifespan, they should be replaced as per requirement.
    In underwater SLIPT, the signal recognition and simultaneously receiving energy
    is a novel approach amongst researchers. The most significant advantage of the
    EH scheme is the applicability for remote locations and harsh water channel conditions.
    This type of EH technology is cost-effective, improves safety and reliability
    [251]. In the SLIPT scenario, it offers high bandwidth, extremely high speed,
    and energy efficiency. Furthermore, the movement of the renewal traditional EH
    technologies towards to SLIPT is the solution for environmentally friendly technology,
    which belongs to the class of green communication [252]. B. SLIPT in Underwater
    Communication An underwater SLIPT scenario is depicted by Fig. 10. Throughout
    the proposed system model, the received signal splits into two chunks simultaneously,
    which are responsible for energy harvesting and information decoding. At the receiver
    end the received signals are converted into AC and DC components. The AC component
    is responsible for the signal decoding while the DC component uses for the EH
    purposes [253]. According to Fig. 10, in the SLIPT system model, if m(t) represents
    the modulated electrical signal and A denotes the peak amplitude. If, + A I assigns
    for a bit “1” while − A I for “0” in modulation and demodulation of VLC signal.
    In consideration of modulation process to control the optical intensity of LED
    with the DC bias ψ , the peak amplitude for each bit is given as [41], A I ≤min(ψ−
    I L , I H −ψ), (54) View Source where I L and I H are denoted the minimum and
    maximum input bias current. Furthermore, in the point-to-point communication scenario,
    the harvested energy is modified and given by [41], [254], E EH = = f I DC V t
    fTrI P t B V t ln(1+ rIh P t ψ I 0 ), (55) View Source where f , I DC , V t ,
    T , r , P t , and I 0 are defined as the fill factor of solar panel, the DC component
    I DC =rI P t ψ , the thermal voltage, time duration during energy harvesting,
    the photo-detector resistivity, the power component, and the dark saturation current
    of solar panel, respectively. Time-Switching (TS) SLIPT Receiver Architecture
    The TS receiver architecture is a disjoint scheme as well as the splitting factors
    t and (1−t) denoted for the optimization in the SLIPT system. According to the
    splitting factor, the ability to gain the idea of exploit harvested energy with
    adequate BER performance. Moreover, the TS mechanism represents separate two-time
    frames for EH and information decoding (ID). Furthermore, TS can use for only
    one function at a time, energy transfer or receiving signal [253]. The TS-SLIPT
    block diagram architecture under the SPLIT system is depicted by Fig.11. Power-Switching
    (PS) SLIPT Receiver Architecture The PS receiver architecture is another combined
    scheme as received current distributed into two phases. The DC component of the
    current phase uses for EH, while the AC component of the current phase uses for
    information decoding purposes. Compared with the TS-SLIPT scheme, the PS design
    could reach high efficiency in EH at the receiver end. Additionally, the PS-SLIPT
    mechanism works at the same time with different power domains for EH and ID [42].
    Fig.12 shows the block diagram of the PS-SLIPT receiver architecture. C. SLIPT
    and SWIPT Schemes The authors in [42] widely discussed which comprised both of
    futuristic SLIPT and SWIPT schemes. In both schemes, the authors obtained the
    behavior of system BER & outage performances along with amount of harvested energy.
    Therefore, the BER and outage performances in the SLIPT scheme perform better
    than the SWIPT scheme at the consecutive photodetector sensitivity and power splitting
    factors. On the contrary case according to [42], the EH in SWIPT shows superior
    performance rather than indoor enabled SLIPT technology. SECTION X. Hybrid Underwater
    Wireless Communication Optical communication as VLC is a promising complementary
    approach instead of RF and acoustic waves signal transmission in the underwater
    medium over short distances. Enabling next generation of wireless network 5GB
    optical communication technique allows the massive number of connectivity of IoUTs.
    In recent years there is a growing interest in deploying VLC as a communication
    link in underwater integrated with existing RF and acoustic waves. Therefore,
    hybrid RF-VLC and FSO-VLC wireless communication links are proposed and showed
    impressive system performances expect to deploy individual point-to-point or point-to-multi-point
    communication links. A wide detailed summary of various hybrid communication techniques
    are depicted by Fig.1 and Fig.13. In RF-UWOC hybrid communication system [48]
    an electromagnetic link combines with an optical link, while in underwater FSO-VLC
    system [255] enables both of optical links for signal propagation. Additionally,
    a dual-hop acoustic-optical link is widely used for signal propagation in the
    underwater medium over long-ranges [256]. In hybrid underwater communication aspect
    various signal transmission techniques are developed and use to enable with FSO,
    VLC, sonar, and underwater acoustic waves. It is challenging to deploy an optical
    communication hybrid network system towards to 5GB and connecting IoUTs. Optical
    wireless communication link supports highly secure signal propagation media under
    visible light (VL), infra-red (IR), and ultraviolet (UV) frequency bands. Nowadays,
    numerous optical wireless communication systems are being developed under consideration
    above three optical frequency bands. In a hybrid link scenario, RF and acoustic
    waves are not required line-of-sight (LOS) nor short ranges but support high mobility
    and better performance in NLOS conditions. The hybrid approaches are integrated
    with two multi-hops different wireless communication technologies such as RF-VLC
    [257], [258], RF-FSO [47], [48], and PLC-VLC [259], [260] are investigated in
    the open literature to provide various advantages as per requirement and deployment.
    Additionally, a hybrid wireless communication system facilitates the integration
    of multiple wireless carrier candidates to cover long-ranges communication along
    with better system performance that overcome the limitation of an individual technology.
    A. RF/FSO Dual-Hop Hybrid Communication Link FSO has become an alternative solution
    for a wireless communication system with high bandwidth over long distances. Terrestrial
    FSO is most widely used as a LOS wireless communication approach that operates
    within 850–1550 nm of optical spectrum wavelength. Due to strong channel conditions,
    the FSO links are attenuated by atmospheric conditions, especially atmospheric
    turbulence, fog, snow, and dust limiting channels. Plenty of FSO based applications
    are recorded in open literature as in [171]. Mostly, in the FSO system the channel
    turbulence phenomenon is a highly noticeable event of the fluctuation of the scintillation
    index. The turbulence effect occurs due to the flexibility of refractive index
    variation inhomogeneities in an atmosphere where the temperature and pressure
    fluctuates. RF waves attenuate easily in an underwater environment and propagate
    over short distances. In hybrid communication over long ranges RF waves signify
    as a promising signal transmission technique. Therefore, RF-FSO underwater is
    a potential solution for acquiring high bandwidth over long distances. In this
    section, an RF-FSO hybrid communication system model is proposed to obtain the
    system performance. A source node S communicates with an underwater-based destination
    D through a floating buoy. The floating buoy works as a decode-and-forward (DF)
    relay protocol R and depicted by Fig.13. The source node transmits the RF signals
    with an average signal power P s . Further, the relay receives the transmitted
    signals re-generates then forwards to the destination D through FSO link. In another
    aspect, if we use the AF relay protocol, the relay received a signal copy from
    S and amplifies then forward to D . Additionally, we consider the RF-FSO combination
    follows Rayleigh flat fading and FSO link is experienced by strong turbulence
    channel conditions for communication between R and D . For strong turbulent channel
    conditions, the fading is modeled through Gamma-Gamma distribution. In hybrid
    communication relaying technique has been widely promoted for signal transmission
    over long ranges. Due to the limitation of FSO signaling on terrestrial based
    communication, the channel impairments have to be taken into account. As turbulence
    and pointing errors are the main cause of optical signal fading, the hybrid communication
    link is widely studied in literature and the performance investigated through
    different modulation and demodulation techniques. In an underwater communication
    scenario, optical communication is a permissible communication media for signal
    transmission. Thus, a number of RF-Optical [46]–[48], [50], [51] and acoustic-optical
    [69], [256], [261], [262] hybrid communication systems are investigated. B. RF/VLC
    Dual-Hop Hybrid Communication Link In optical communication aspect VLC shows an
    impressive performance for signal transmission over short distances. VLC uses
    LED luminaries, which are very cost-effective, easy to install, and 100 Gbps data
    can be achieved. Similarly, VLC also affects by strong channel conditions, especially
    sunlight. VLC integrated with RF and a hybrid RF-VLC combination shows better
    performance in different waters. A dual-hop hybrid RF-VLC underwater communication
    link proposed in [114]. The system model consists of three or more nodes for signal
    transmission where a relay function re-generates or amplifies signal information
    and further communicates with the underwater-based destination. In [114], the
    system model is assumed in half-duplex mode with a single antenna at relay, while
    the nodes are fixed. Moreover, the relay should mount two directional antennas
    in full-duplex mode, where one antenna receives the transmitted signals from source
    and the other antenna towards to the destination for further communication with
    the destination. The BER performance of RF-VLC dual-hop hybrid cooperative communication
    system [257] in different water types under strong channel conditions are depicted
    by Fig.14. C. FSO/VLC Dual-Hop Hybrid Communication Link The traditional underwater
    communication media is modeled by acoustic waves that supports low data rate and
    bandwidth with high delayed signal propagation. FSO-VLC combination full-fill
    the acceptability of desired communication requirements with a highly achievable
    data rate. This hybrid communication could be operating in half and full-duplex
    mode as both are optical links and sever almost the same channel impairments.
    The high turbulence channel conditions, current water waves, misalignment, and
    physio-chemical properties such as pressure, temperature, and salinity affects
    FSO and VLC links. A hybrid FSO-VLC combination is proposed in the open literature,
    where an AUV communicates with terrestrial based station through a floating buoy
    that functions as a relay to assist received information from the source-based
    station. The BER performance of an investigate FSO/VLC dual-hop hybrid communication
    system [257] in different water types is depicted by Fig.15. D. PLC/VLC Dual-Hop
    Hybrid Communication Link Another approach of hybrid underwater communication
    VLC link combined with power line communication (PLC) technology. A telecommunication
    technology PLC is based on the use of power grids for high-speed information transmission.
    The low transmission speed and poor noise immunity are the bottlenecks of this
    technology. Rather than this, the advent of PLC strengthens digital signal processors
    (DSP), making it possible to use more complex signal modulation methods such as
    OFDM modulation. PLC can be used to create a small base station where the main
    requirements for the network are ease of implementation, device mobility, and
    easy scalability. The small cell base station (CBS), e.g., femtocell access point
    (FAP) are used as a small cellular base station that serves 6–8 users. In hybrid
    PLC-VLC combined communication link a small power grid antenna connects with the
    small base station (SBS) through line cable. The signal is transmitted from SBS
    to the antenna via cable and further this antenna mounts by LEDs for further signal
    transmission to divers or UWSNs in shallow water. E. Optical-Acoustic and RF-Acoustic
    Dual-Hop Hybrid Communication Link The study of acoustic waves involves the discovery
    and deployment of sound waves transmission in fluid media. Acoustic waves are
    generally defined as mechanical and longitudinal vibrational ripples that can
    travel through solid, liquid, or gas mediums in a wave patterns. Underwater acoustic
    is an alternative signal propagation method of sound in water, especially over
    long ranges undersea. Sound waves are the most effective energy transmission wireless
    carriers that propagate over long distances in the ocean. Moreover, acoustic waves
    can tolerate the pressure and the temperature of the deep oceans. Neither RF nor
    optical waves are suitable for long-range transmissions in an underwater environment
    as acoustic waves [263]. Usually, the speed of acoustic waves is comparably low
    (Approximately 1500 m/s) [74]. Although, according to the layer clarification
    the speed varies in cold water and lower than normal water. Acoustic waves are
    used for long-ranges transmissions approximately up to 15 – 20 km, but these waves
    cannot achieve high bandwidth signals undersea. Due to low frequency, bandwidth,
    speed, and additionally the received signals are delayed at the destination [264],
    [265]. However, the sound waves depend on the compressibility and density of the
    medium. In [266], an acoustic sound speed profile (SSP) system model has been
    proposed for 1 km as follows, c= 1448.96+4.591T−0.591 T 2 +0.00029 T 3 +(1.340−0.01T)(S−35)+0.0163z,
    (56) View Source where the temperature in 0C, salinity in PSU, depth in meters,
    and speed of sound in m/s are denoted by T , S , z , and c , respectively. Sound
    waves propagate according to water current concerning every instant of time. An
    empirical model is described as a function of physical water properties such as
    temperature, salinity, and pressure varies with depth. Stratification of these
    parameters lead to stratification of wave motion, which entails the existence
    of specific profiles. Mackenzie has developed a mathematical formula in applied
    science during 1981s [267]. As already discussed, underwater optical communication
    is an alternative approach that refers to transmit signals in an aqueous medium.
    VLC communication has more superiority in comparison to acoustic waves but over
    short distances. To fulfill the gap of long-range communication, a hybrid optical-acoustic
    communication system is considerable. In this type of system model, the underwater-based
    mobile station transmits the acoustic signals and further convert into optical
    format for decoding purposes at the targeted node. SECTION XI. Underwater Sensor
    Networks Architecture Recently, there have been growing interests in underwater
    wireless sensor networks (UWSNs). The fundamental source of ocean exploration
    underwater sensor architecture is defined as a group of sensor nodes that are
    established undersea to exchange information wirelessly with the base station
    (BS) and floating vehicles (nodes). The growing interest of UWSNs for a wide variety
    of purposes about oceanography, monitoring marine life, seismic surveillance,
    oil-fields exploration, military applications, and deep-sea activities. In this
    regard, the necessity of UWSNs contributes a significant role in UWC. Generally,
    UWSN nodes are enabled with acoustic and optical links for data transmission within
    various applications. Energy conservation and self battery powered is a critical
    issue in UWSN technology. This survey estimates the target position and improves
    energy efficiency in hibernating and an active mode of underwater sensor nodes
    (USNs). The network of underwater sensors fixed with a certain depth or with the
    bottom of the deep ocean for early detection warning of an earthquake, tectonic
    plate movements, and active volcanos before striking the coastal and residential
    areas. The floating nodes are used to detect ice sheet melting and rising water
    level phenomenon, coral reef, water pollution, and physio-chemical properties
    of water. The development of floating nodes AUV supports to improve the quality
    of geographical mapping and navigation systems in underwater sectors. Localization
    is another significant application of UWSNs for tracking location or Global Positioning
    System (GPS) in harsh water mediums [268]. The integration of sensor nodes architecture
    has permitted to allow communication, localization, and GPS. In an underwater
    environment, navigation and localization are the two most significant challenges
    for mobile robots, floating nodes, and different underwater applications. Aforementioned,
    acoustic and optical signal-based sensor networking systems are the most widely
    used for various underwater applications. Through the proposed underwater applications
    the acoustic and optical transponders are used to navigate an AUV. The sound navigation
    and ranging (SONAR) enabled AUV methodology has been proposed with the two basic
    configurations introduced as side-scan SONAR (SSS) and Forward-Looking SONAR (FLS)
    in [269] and [270]. The above SSS and FLS are used for monitoring marine life
    and detection for underwater environmental changes [271]. While an array of sensor
    nodes with a camera or without a camera can be implemented for long ranges navigation
    and imaging systems [272]. A. Simultaneous Location and Mapping (SLAM) SLAM is
    an AUV-enabled imaging technique and an essential solution for mapping unknown
    locations within the unknown environment to develop a consistent geographical
    mapping of an underwater environment [271]. In contrast, the SLAM imaging AUV-based
    technology that supports constructing a 3D image in different color frames is
    widely discussed in [273]. The authors in the above-proposed work defined a color-coding
    representation for the reconstruction of unknown mapping sectors, where each color
    code has its specified distance measurement between AUV and obstacles. The various
    methods are presented in the literature of SLAM to the reconstruction of the unknown
    sectors in underwater environment [271], [274]–[277]. Each method has its inadequacies
    and strengths according to the desired interaction, inspection, and navigation
    implementation. Furthermore, underwater SLAM is differentiated into acoustic-based,
    and vision-based categories [278]. The acoustic-based underwater SLAM is used
    for intense unknown segments, while the vision-based SLAM is suffered from limited
    visibility and background noise by natural sources in shallow waters. Therefore,
    a high-definition FLS SLAM could be a promising alternative solution in geographical
    mapping to mitigate the problematic solution. B. Underwater Acoustic Sensor Network
    UASNs is an approach that supports the exploration of extremely dark and highly
    deep oceans. UASNs deploy for various underwater applications such as for detection
    submarines and unmanned operations for military purposes. The UWSNs architecture
    is categorized into fixed 2D and mobility 3D sensors. In the 3D type of architectural
    sensor system, the motion of nodes controls the internal navigation system. The
    floating nodes are free to move underwater with the drift and unpropelled type
    of portable devices such as unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs), AUVs, ROVs, drifters,
    and gliders. The main function of these devices is to collect oceanographic data
    from an aqueous medium. The various types of UWSNs are summarized by Table 8.
    The drifter operates mostly through the ground, which drifts with wind and surface
    waves to acquire the possible measurement of marine sectors, further sharing the
    collected data with the base station through satellite. Moreover, the gliders
    are driven by the buoyant force and connected with the floating buoy or the cluster
    head for sharing collected data. In existing work, there are the two main groups
    of UASNs known as content-based and scheduled-based protocols proposed in [279].
    UASNs are classified into two categories as content-based and scheduled-based
    nodes. The Content-based nodes exchange signals to each other, while scheduled-based
    nodes eliminate the exchange of aggregated data between transmission nodes. Alternatively
    stated content-based nodes do not meet the desired gap and are critically suitable
    for UWC. In contrast, due to high propagation latency and narrow bandwidth, the
    scheduled-based nodes such as TDMA and FDMA are less suitable. However, CDMA is
    a more suitable approach for UAN to be deployed in underwater medium [268]. TABLE
    8 The Various Types of Underwater Sensor Network Nodes (UWSNs) Architectures Established
    in the Open Literature to Cope With Issues of Highly Delay, Low Bandwidth, Heavy
    Turbulence Channel Conditions. The Architectures are Enabled for the Required
    Underwater Applications From Short to Long Ranges C. Architecture of Underwater
    Sensor Network Nodes (UWSNs) UASN is commonly used for underwater exploration
    but quite adequate to meet the demand for real-time streaming and high data rate
    scenario. RF wave-based underwater sensor network nodes (UWRFSNs) are the potential
    approachable technique TO full-fill the requirement of various underwater applications.
    In this section, the discussion is carried out of the different types UWSNs along
    with their deployment challenges. 1D-UWSNs Architecture: The single dimension
    (1D) UWSNs are the self-employed types of deployable networks underwater. In this
    type of sensor network, the individual node is self-configured by itself. In this
    type of architecture, each node has the capability of sensing and it is responsible
    for processing collection data within the remote area [281]. The sensor node could
    be fixed with a seabed or a floating buoy responsible for collecting the useful
    oceanographic data and further shared with the BS. In another scenario, the floating
    buoy could be the buoyant type of node that floats a certain depth underwater
    and then float towards the BS for information transmission. AUVs also function
    as self-configured individual nodes; they can floats at any horizontal and vertical
    depth to sense the data and share it with the onshore data center. The 1D-UWSNs
    type of architecture enables acoustic, EM, and optical communication-based wireless
    signaling technology. The 1D-UWSNs are widely deployable for single-hop communication
    where the nodes directly communicate with the BS; in VLC scenario 1D type of UWSNs
    usable for plenty of underwater applications in shallow waters such as rivers,
    dams, lakes, etc. 2D-UWSNs Architecture: The 2D type of UWSN is referred as a
    group of sensor networks (cluster) where the nodes communicate with the cluster
    head. The fixed or anchored cluster head collects the sensed data from each node
    and further transmits it to the vertical buoyant transceiver of the BS. In 2D-UWSN
    architecture, it is considered that each node communicates with the cluster head
    horizontally and communicates with the vertical buoyant node as well. Thus, this
    type of node architecture is called 2D-UWSNs, based on acoustic, EM, and optical
    waves-based wireless signaling technology for long ranges in an underwater environment.
    In the UVLC scenario, all local and cluster head nodes link and transmit the information
    with the remote station. The 2D type of UWSNs architecture is proposed in [291]
    for the purpose of short-term aquatic exploration applications and extensively
    discussed. The 2D-type of UWSNs is depicted in Fig.1. 3D-UWSN Architecture: The
    3D type of UWSN describes the network architecture where the sensor cluster nodes
    are deployed in different depths in underwater medium. Due to different depths,
    the clusters communication links established are variable in 3D space geometry
    in undersea. The communication link among the sensor nodes would be in three dimensions
    space for the mobility of data transmission. Additionally, in 3D-UWSNs, the cluster
    communicates among the neighboring clusters at varying depths, and the cluster
    network nodes communicate with their cluster head. All the cluster heads collect
    the sensed data by their local sensors and further transmit it to the buoyant
    node or with the BS. The 3D type of UWSNs can be deployed for underwater applications
    requirement based on acoustic, EM, and optical communication [281]. Moreover,
    the 3D underwater sensor network localization has been widely discussed in [282].
    In UVLC enabled sensor network communication, the high probability of real-time
    monitoring and achieving high data rate. The 3D-type of UWSNs is depicted in Fig.1.
    4D-UWSN Architecture: The 4D type of sensor network architectural system is designed
    by combining anchored sensor nodes with the floating or mobile UWSNs nodes at
    different underwater depths. The 4D-UWSN architecture is deployable for long ranges
    communication among the nodes. Mostly, the mobile UWSNs consist of ROVs for the
    data collection from an anchored or fixed nodes at the seabed in varying depth.
    The ROVs can be submersible robots, vehicles, ships, and even submarines. Each
    node can relay information with ROV and depending on the distance between the
    node and ROV. Furthermore, the signal transmission is the distance-dependent between
    underwater sensor nodes and ROV [292]. The 2D-type of UWSNs is depicted in Fig.16.
    SECTION XII. Recent Development of Internet of Underwater Things (IoUTs) The network
    of the internet of underwater things (IoUTs) is a potential novel approach for
    data collection within the underwater environment that has to be transferred with
    the BS for further analysis. IoUTs is a group of wireless network-enabled smart
    devices and could be a wide range of underwater sensor nodes architecture. The
    different types of UWSNs architectures are discussed in the earlier sections for
    various underwater application purposes. The system architecture of IoUT has received
    attention for developing smart ocean and innovative business surrounded by smart
    interconnected underwater water objects [70]. The most widely deployable IoUTs
    are discussed as follow and depicted by Fig.16. A. Sea Gliders and Autonomous
    Underwater Vehicles The Internet-connected devices structure provides a pretty
    reasonable communication bridge among the nodes. For underwater communication
    purposes, wirelessly connected devices are recognized as the internet of underwater
    things (IoUTs). These devices could be identified as network nodes, AUVs, moving
    gliders, ROVs and floating buoys, etc. Whereas sea gliders and AUVs provide the
    measurement of oceanic environment over long-ranges especially for bathymetric
    data collection. The thrust and movement of the sea-gliders are used as an electrically
    driven propellers and are operated by an installed battery that provides upthrust
    with buoyancy for forwarding or upward motion. The AUVs and sea-gliders are designed
    to cover thousands of miles for several months within underwater mediums. These
    devices sink up to 1km from the sea surface due to their energy capacity limits.
    Furthermore, these types of nodes are deployed for oceanographic data collection
    and GPS purposes. An architecture of IoUTs that involves the multiple wave gliders
    for acoustical observation is proposed [293]. The internal sensors of sea-gliders
    determine the direction of vehicle when it dives underwater. The external sensor
    scans the ocean to collect the data. The movement of sea-gliders, AUV, UUV, and
    ROVs, is shown in Fig.16. B. Underwater Animal Telemetry Animal telemetry is another
    effective approach for ocean exploration and uses to observe the marine environment.
    This tagging technology enables us to get to know about the marine life inhabitants
    and their interaction with coastal shelf ecosystem to polar seas and the open
    oceans [294]. Animal telemetry supports observing the exploration summary of the
    vast oceans, underwater environmental changes, and marine pollution. The air-sea
    interface is necessary to understand the observation and oceanic exploration of
    daily water conditions, driving global climate changes, biogeochemical cycle process,
    heavy wind and water currents to exchange the momentum and other micro-particles
    [294]. The various IoUTs such as HFR, satellites, drifters, and autonomous surface
    vehicles (ASVs) are widely used to observe the air-sea interface. To mitigate
    such challenges, the development of a small communicating device that can be mounted
    on the floating seabird back that contained a sensing data unit with a battery
    is capable of measuring the water surface, water currents, and winds over the
    sea [294]–[297]. For more details about animal telemetry, a pictorial view is
    referred to for this approach in Fig.16. C. A Deep Detectable Tsunami Buoy Tsunamis
    and earthquakes are sudden events and highly impossible to control. Nevertheless,
    these events are predictabled by deploying an early detectable device called a
    tsunami buoy. The primary function of a tsunami buoy is the detection and monitoring
    of the high level ocean water waves (Tides). The tsunami events are generated
    by undersea earthquakes that bureau of meteorology confirms. The tsunami buoys
    are deployed for observation and recorded the changes in sea level and bottomless
    oceans. It enhances the capability for early detection warning of tsunamis and
    floods before hitting the land. The buoy splits into two major components: the
    pressure sensor anchored with the sea bead and a surface buoy that floats on the
    water surface. The anchored sensors at the sea-bed are used to measure the changes
    in the height of the water column (the height h of the water column is the function
    of water pressure p as p=ρgh ). In more contrast, the measured water column height
    utilized for communication purposes with the floating buoy (works as a relay)
    through sound waves and further relayed via satellite to the tsunami warning center
    [298]. The function of the tsunami buoy is depicted in Fig.16. D. Underwater Floating
    Drifters Through the immense development of drifters, observing the global ocean
    currents and their effects are the main concerns. Recent advancements of drifters
    support the ocean circulation patterns in real-time monitoring the deployment
    of the drifters possibly in shallow water by a ship or another source. On the
    deployment of the drifter when it floats, the transmitter is activated and starts
    to share the collected oceanographic data with the satellite, this collected data
    is further to transmitted with the offshore BS for analysis. Other inbuilt sensors
    at drifters are responsible for collecting the various types of data such as water
    surface temperature, wind, ocean color, pressure, and salinity [299]. The data
    synchronization with the satellite has been depicted in Fig.16. E. Underwater
    Hydrophones Generally, the signal propagation effects by channel impairments;
    noise is one of signal corrupting factors. The array of hydrophones are designed
    to be deployed for noise detection in an aqueous medium. Also, the hydrophones
    produce a limited voltage signal over high-frequency ranges while receiving the
    underwater sound from any direction. Deployment of an array of hydrophones amplifies
    and records the received noise more precisely. Omni-directional and Hemi-directional
    hydrophones support to collect the sound from a particular direction; it is also
    to track underwater the movement of underwater species. Therefore, hydrophones
    are the fundamental tools for plenty of undersea acoustic applications such as
    Sono-buoys, wired hydrophones, and autonomous hydrophones [287]. In addition,
    the NOAA’s Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL) under NOAA’s National
    Marine Sanctuaries also frequently uses hydrophones [300]. In addition to that
    NOAA’s PMEL derives a long-term datasets for the global ocean acoustic environment.
    It has been utilized to identify and evaluate acoustic influences of human activities
    and natural disasters such as the eruption of an underwater volcano and glacial
    earthquakes in the marine environment [301]. The deployment of hydrophones in
    the underwater scenario has shown in Fig.16. F. Clod Cards Use the Measurement
    of Water Flow The clod cards are ice-shaped identical trapezoidal geometries and
    made by alabaster or plaster of Paris (gypsum blocks) and utilize to analyze underwater
    flow patterns. The ingredients of clod cards or made by the combination of the
    100ml of freshwater with 80gm plaster of Paris powder manufactured by the Hobby
    Craft Trading limited, Dorest UK [302]. In [302], the clod cards were sanded at
    the bottom of the water bodies to accomplish a consistent weight of 12.5 ± 1.5
    gm. Every individual plaster cube must be glued with the plastic plate size 3×8
    cm with silicone cement in this strategy. To measure the exact water flows analysis,
    the four clod cards established in four cardinal directions in front of their
    faces are fixed to a straight pole for at least 24 hours. The requirement of clod
    cards deployment in predetermined sites for various underwater applications such
    as divers, ROVs, and floating nodes. After a limited and fixed time duration (approximately
    1 to 2 days), the clod cards have to be retrieved, dried at 40 0 C , and reweighed
    to calculate the decay and the strong water flow. Conversely, the exact weight
    loss of the plaster of Paris is determined from each card and sent to the laboratory
    for further analysis. As a result, it can be concluded that the clods who lost
    more weight are exposed to greater water flow than those who lost less weight.
    Accordingly, the cloud card can be used to measure several other essential parameters
    from the ocean. An implementation of a clod card has been depicted in Fig.16.
    G. Satellite Oceanography The weather observational satellite is the most significant
    tool to share constructive information with the base station. Additionally, the
    satellite plays a vital role in ocean observation research and functions as an
    intermediate communication node for information transmission between the underwater
    and offshore base stations. For oceanographic data collection, environmental satellites
    are widely used to capture images and calculate the surface temperature of oceans.
    It is also used to know the water patterns and further shared the collected data
    with the terrestrial-based stations for analysis. For real-time video, steaming
    could be possible by utilizing satellites in different color coding techniques
    for water flow analysis. It supports determining the impact of floods and tsunami
    along the coastal area along with the detection of algal blooms. In the most recent
    years, remote sensing technology-enabled with the satellite that has boosted for
    data synchronization with altimetry (study to measures the height of sea surface),
    scatterometry (study to measures wind speed and direction), as well as the bathymetric
    (study of the ocean floor) approaches. These are the technologies that make the
    smart satellite for ocean observation, monitoring, and GPS. Additionally, to monitor
    early detection warnings to evacuate the coastal area and develop major storms,
    such as hurricanes and tornadoes, geosynchronous environmental satellites are
    being used. The most important information of coral reefs, coastal habitats, and
    similar environments can be analyzed by the satellite photography [303]. In Fig.16,
    an environmental satellite is depicted for ocean mapping. H. Remotely Operated
    Vehicles (ROVs) ROVs are accessed remotely and functioned similarly as a robot.
    This type of node has been designed for underwater exploration and deployment
    for various underwater applications to find the lost ships, repair and monitor
    gas pipelines, habitat mapping, etc. Specifically, the ROVs are equipped with
    sensors and sampling tools for data collection at variable distances from the
    oceans. A network cable is used to detect and observing the objects by illuminating
    the light, establishes a communication link between the base station and floating
    node to controls commands of the proper node movement. The ROV is a well-equipped
    floating vehicle enabled with advanced features that contain a lighting system
    with a camera at the frontal portion for videography to record a better sub-aquatic
    panorama. It is especially utilized in the aquatic medium for the contribution
    of geology education and sea life learning [304]. The exploration and functioning
    of ROV in an underwater medium have shown in Fig.16. SECTION XIII. Integration
    of Advance and Next Generation Communication Technology Currently, with the immense
    enhancement of data traffic in telecommunication industries, a large number of
    regular users have been observed. An alternative communication media has an essential
    role in the wireless networking era to fulfill the requirements of further innovations,
    research, and further development of new emerging communication technologies.
    The development of optical communication applications in visible light has become
    an immense growth in different fields. Nowadays, the trade of VLC applications
    became more reliable and highly efficient in acquiring indoor and outdoor scenarios.
    VLC uses the limited frequency ranges about 430 – 790 THz at the wavelength ranges
    380 – 750 nm. The benefit of this frequency range is the compatibility with the
    human eye with no effect on an electrical circuit. The basic concept in VLC signaling
    is the information modulation happens at the receiver end while demodulation is
    held by a photo-detector and decodes the signal from received information under
    fluctuation of the light intensity. The communication link is enabled with a lighting
    system as LED, which offers a considerable bandwidth with a desirable high data
    rate. Cellular technologies have changed and support improving the system qualities
    and performances. To proliferate smart internet-connected devices, emerging advanced
    future wireless networks play an ample role for an efficient and reliable communication
    link among the network architectural nodes as 5G networks have shown superior
    performances as a key enabling wireless technology. Also, the 5GB and 6G would
    be offered an immense performance while linked with the multiple nodes. The latest
    5GB wireless network would significantly impact various wireless connected applications
    such as intelligent transportation, device-to-device (D2D) communication, underwater
    optical communication, and internet-connected devices. The most recent survey
    on 6G wireless network carried out an outperform study about VLC enabling communication
    signaling through laser and LEDs [305]. A. 5G Networking System in Underwater
    5G wireless communication system has been designed to offer a significant improvement,
    especially for enhancing the system capacity, spectral efficiency, and energy
    efficiency of the communication system. For efficient and reliable wireless communication,
    5G is widely accepted to combine the small cell, picocells, and macrocells [306].
    The commercial use of 5G during 2019s established a collaborative communication
    system on a terrestrial basis, excluding the underwater environmental communication.
    The deployment of a 5G wireless network underwater will be an innovative step
    to improve data extraction from an aqueous medium for further analysis. As being
    improving the system capacity and essential assets of high data rate underwater
    wireless communication technology, optical communication towards 5G is the key
    solution that attracts the scientific community. Although, the most recent experimental
    study and the performance evaluation of 520nm wavelength laser-diode towards 5G
    is presented as [307]. In [307], the authors analyzed the performance of an underwater
    optical system under consideration of varying salinity conditions in pure water.
    Facing these issues, the Generalized Frequency Division Multiplexing (GFDM) is
    proposed as a novel underwater wireless network candidate towards the next generation
    standard based on multi-branch multi-carrier filter bank in [43]. It is presented
    and generalized the traditional OFDM technique with several advantages as minimal
    peak to average power ratio (PAPR). Minimizing PAPR is one of the key advantage
    features in GFDM over OFDM and a significant parameter to analyze the performance
    characteristics of the communication system [308]. As recorded the limited bandwidth
    in underwater acoustic, OFDM suits for communication purposes. In contrast, OFDM
    offers a profitable integration over single-carrier modulations against the frequency
    selective fading [309]. Therefore, to come up for all these issues, the requirement
    to deploy multi-carrier transmission schemes. GFDM [310] and filter bank multi-carrier
    (FBMC) [311] are proposed the new promising emerging communication techniques
    towards 5G applications. B. Predictable 5G and Beyond (5GB) Networking System
    in Underwater The forthcoming next-generation 5G and beyond (5GB) communication
    will indeed offer numerous advanced services with ultra-high capabilities, an
    extensive number of device connectivity, very ultra-low energy consumption, and
    latency along with ultra-high security, extremely high quality of services (QoS),
    and high-resolution experience (HRE) [312]. The 6G networks are anticipated to
    accommodate and exceeded performance in comparison with 5G. Thus, the exceptionally
    high data will greatly impact networking users and the critical factor for more
    complex future challenges in various sectors such as in healthcare, long-range
    communication, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, underwater communication,
    etc. Though, the prediction to launch the 6G communication system is anticipated
    till 2030s [313]. Indeed, the 6G wireless communication network will provide the
    next level of signal transmission qualitative performance compared with 5G communication.
    The recent advances of and application of optical communication technologies towards
    5G/6G are summarized in detail [314]. An extremely high data rate up to 100Gbps
    by deploying VLC has been confirmed in [315] and [316]. Internet of underwater
    things (IoUTs) is the essential part of an underwater communication system connected
    with a standardized communication network for data extraction in the real-time
    scenario from the underwater environment. The implementation of 6G integrating
    UWC will be a revolutionary step to explore aqueous mediums as IoUTs connected
    with VLC. The most significant aim is predicted to connect underwater-based nodes
    with satellites for global coverage and observation all around the globe. C. Internet
    of Underwater Things (IoUTs) IoUTs refer to internet-connected devices that can
    easily and legitimately retrieve information through cabled or wireless-enabled
    connectivity. UIoTs claims to be an extension and development phase of IoTs, which
    allows the extraction of anonymous information from smart ocean [317]. IoUTs are
    enabled by the most recent developments of AUVs, ROVs, smart underwater sensor
    networks, and routing protocols. The architecture of UIoTs depicted in Fig.1 and
    Fig.13, enable numerous applications in an underwater environment in terms of
    sensing, monitoring, and identify underwater objects. In underwater internet of
    things (UIoTs), the sensor network nodes collect data and communicate with the
    cluster head. Furthermore, the received data has to transmit with a base station
    for subsequent analysis. The IoUTs structure enables the UVLC link to be classified
    into two major categories: horizontal and slant communication systems. Described
    in more detail, the horizontal link has been an extensively focused study on increasing
    data rate and signal propagation length along with reducing underwater turbulence
    effects while slant links formed high depth considering wave height wind speed,
    sea surface slope, and heavy turbulence conditions. On the other hand, in the
    vertical link for high depth, pressure increases up to 10bar for each k th layer
    (each layer for k=10m ) in addition temperature decreases from 250C to freezing
    point, the above matter facts due to varying salinity which affects the refractive
    index. SECTION XIV. Underwater Optical Wireless Network Applications Oceans are
    mysterious and challenging water bodies to explore. Plenty of natural disasters
    such as volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, and tsunamis occur by imbalanced water
    phenomena that could be observed and monitored by deploying communication links.
    To address the requirement of current emerging underwater applications which have
    been used in the context of rising water level, environmental monitoring, marine
    life, early detection tsunami, oil and gas rigs exploration, volcanic eruptions,
    coastal securities, and sliding tectonic plates, jointly with various hybrid wireless
    communication systems. Moreover, undersea wireless communication over long distances,
    UWSN plays an essential role in data transmission. The traditional acoustic modems
    are widely used in long-range UWC, whether low speed (approximately 1500 m/s)
    in such complexity of water channel conditions [318]. In more contrast, for high
    depth, the floating nodes AUVs, and UAVs are used to transfer information from
    source to destination. RF waves transmission show poor performance in an underwater
    environment cause the EM waves propagation depend on the intrinsic properties
    of the channel. Contrarily, the water medium has more density, permittivity, and
    higher electrical conductivity than air. Therefore, RF waves easily attenuate
    when propagating over successive distances [94]. For such transmission scenarios,
    a high data rate cooperative dual-hop RF-UVLC and FSO/UVLC systems are needed
    to be deployed [48], [180] [319]. As, VLC provides a high capacity of data rate
    over moderate distances, an acceptable wireless media for underwater mapping,
    and real-time video streaming with high resolution and various UVLC applications
    as follows. A. Ocean Floor Bathymetry The study of exploring the ocean floor is
    referred to the depths and shape of the underwater terrain [320], as stated bathymetry
    is the most significant investigation that deploys in numerous underwater applications.
    Additionally, the collection of geographical and oceanographic data analysis updates
    of weather and natural hazards on our earth. The massive water reservoirs are
    still unmapped, unexplored, and unobserved sectors. Only a very few oceanic portions
    have been mapped systematically by direct measurement [127]. The rest of the unexplored
    fraction of oceans are predicted by the satellite altimeter data, which is the
    approximated estimation structure of the seabed. A newly sounding technique is
    proposed that supports measuring ocean depth over less than 18% of the seafloor
    resolution about 1km [321]. Furthermore, the two most significant seafloor mapping
    techniques are proposed as Single Beam Echo-Sounders (SBES) [127], [322] and Multi-beam
    Echo-Sounders (MBES) [127], [323], respectively. The use of the two-way travel
    time of sound waves methodologies are used for measurement sea depth directly,
    where the sound waves strike with the seabed. On the other hand, in the MBES system,
    the enabled fan generates sound waves for further data collection. These sound
    waves are responsible for re-echoing signals generated in areas of the strait
    perpendicular to that fan, leading to the ocean floor mapping. Therefore, the
    established system receives hundreds of beams capable of mapping the narrow sectors
    up to 150 degrees. B. Underwater Environmental Exploration and Monitoring Most
    of the underwater environmental monitoring applications are related explicitly
    to observing manual and habitable activities in the oceanic environment. By deploying
    the UWSNs, the water pollution, water flows, and lives could be monitored. Additionally,
    the tectonic plate movement, underwater thunderstorms, earthquakes, and new formation
    of lands due to the eruption of volcanoes (the lava plays a significant role in
    forming a chunk of the island, etc.) being monitored. The floating nodes at different
    depths can observe and collect data of the 3D geometry of open oceans and terrains
    as human beings are highly interested in exploring the underwater environment
    since their existence. The scientific community is a witness in the exploration
    of less than 5% of oceans. A vast number of underwater applications are immersed
    by floating nodes as AUVs, ROVs, and UUVs for monitoring and observing the marine
    lives along with the three-dimensional geographical data within real-time scenario
    [283]. The study of monitoring water quality, pollution, impurities underwater
    is more challenging. Various water samples are being used to monitor water quality
    regarding the pH level, oxygen ( O 2 ), and ammonium nitrate ( N H 3 ). Moreover,
    the underwater monitoring also includes water macrophytes or hydrophytes, marine
    species, coral reefs, and algae for further analysis. In more contrast, environmental
    monitoring is also a fundamental approach through IoUT enabled applications which
    include the physio-chemical properties of water such as pressure, temperature,
    and variation in underwater are the main concerns [324]. The continuous monitoring
    of underwater helps to check remotely the pH water level. The water pollution
    monitoring is also substantial for the ecological system, especially for undersea
    species. IoUT provides an opportunity to explore the bottomless underwater reservoirs
    to discover lost human civilizations and lost treasure. Moreover, to identify
    the roughness of the seafloor, natural minerals, oil, and gas treasures. Many
    lost-treasure discoveries were made through the IoUTs. C. Navigation & Surveillance
    Oceans are highly complex and unguided water bodies which are 95% unexplored in
    scientific research. As a result, underwater navigation is more complicated than
    terrestrial basis. UWSNs are appropriate and the most suitable technological approach
    that supports navigation in hulking aqueous mediums. Especially, for navigation
    the 3D underwater sensor network (USN) localization system is investigated in
    [282]. In [282], the authors propose the superiority of 3D Underwater Sensor Positioning
    (USP) systematic planning, which is beneficial for improving localization capabilities
    over existing 3D sensor architectures with predictable, balanced communication
    underwater. An AUV-assisted localization scenario of USNs roaming across the underwater
    sensor fields is presented in [325]. A wide range of localization of acoustic
    network nodes in the underwater medium is summarized in open literature as in
    [326]–[332]. Since optical communication is a novel technique to implement the
    localization and navigation purposes. Therefore, the authors in [333] investigated
    the connectivity of underwater wireless optical sensor networks (UWOSNs) as the
    influential factor to the system performance. Most recently, an extensive study
    based on received signal strength to the centralized localization scheme is proposed
    in [13]. Counterpart surveillance is a more efficient tool for node detection
    for military purposes or coastal securities. AUVs are used as emerging communication
    nodes for surveillance and retrieving information for defense operations. A most
    recent survey summarized the AUV capabilities for underwater communication in
    [271]. The authors in [271] are widely discussed the possible underwater application
    through AUV such as signal transmission, localization, and navigation purposes
    where the RF waves are incapable of retrieving the digital information. D. Naval-Mine
    Reconnaissance As we know that underwater environments are highly deepest and
    massive water reservoirs, countless mines in oceans could be found by deploying
    UWSNs connecting with ships safe voyage or floating and operational activities.
    A recent work is proposed to design an underwater mine detection system in [334].
    The authors have suggested a model minefield that includes the type of mines to
    be detected and mine-clearing operations by deploying the sonar waves in the various
    depth of the oceanic environment. Another impressive work in the open literature,
    where the authors have proposed the detection of underwater mines in real-time
    scenarios [335]. In [335], an AUV floats at different depths with sonar waves
    transmission along with a camera for real-time observation. Naval mines are also
    a real threat to maritime and naval tactical operations. Underwater-based mines
    hide or buried by the high altitude of tides and water currents, even covered
    by muddy soil at the sea bottom [336]. In most of the conditions, the naval mines
    are undetectable by low-frequency ranges. To cope with this issue, the challenge
    is that a high-frequency range of sonar should be mounted through an AUV to detect
    or bathymetric data of naval mines. For instance, the ECA Group deals with the
    issues within an innovative technological solution to perform complex missions
    in hostile or harsh environments [336]. According to SOACYS, the first prototype
    in the form of a 5 to 40m longship is used to collect oceanic data 1 Teabyte within
    2400km of survey lines [337]. This small ship prototype is used for various applications
    such as UneXploded Ordnance (UXO), debris, boulders, pipelines/cables, marine
    archeology, sedimentary studies, etc. E. Border & Coastal Securities The border
    and coastal securities applications are mainly used to observe unwanted activities
    in coastal areas such as entry port security, land border security, and maritime
    border security. Taking account of these issues, USWNs an emerging technique for
    various military operations and are used for military communication purposes.
    These integral networking signals have a key role in providing such facilities
    to the military as surveillance, intelligence, localization, targeting positions,
    and tracking nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons. A high capacity command
    control communication system of ASELSAN is used to enhance situational awareness,
    accurate decision making, and faster response qualities in coastal and border
    security system solutions [338]. F. Seismic Monitoring and Ocean Sampling The
    oceans are extremely large water reservoirs that change over the time. The sensor
    nodes are the main advantageous communication networking tools for sampling and
    observing the underwater environment, collecting oceanographic data, and transmitting
    signals to the source (e.g., base stations, etc.). The floating sensor nodes could
    be deployed at high depth for ocean mapping and underwater sampling activities.
    Furthermore, earthquakes, tsunami, and floods are sudden and unexpected events
    that cause major catastrophy worldwide. Sudden slip of bedrock causes seismic
    waves that shake the ground. UWSNs are dedicated to monitoring seismic activities
    and recording data for early detection warning [339]. G. Future Direction UVLC
    has drawn attention to the futuristic deployment of UWC, which opens the doors
    of advanced wireless communication systems towards 5GB networking system in the
    nearest future. Currently, it is possible to transmit the data at high speed as
    well as the wireless energy transfer through the illumination phenomena of LEDs.
    UVLC has a fruitful future perspectives due to the wide range of popularity of
    LEDs all around the world [42]. Therefore, UVLC has shown potential acceptability
    for next-generation 5GB networking systems for further developments in the digital
    wireless generation of communication phase. LEDs are very cost-effective optical
    signaling elements that have more superiority over traditional wireless communication
    media. The light spectrum of the optical beam visible light and LED illumination
    is a comfortable illusion for aquatic species. Therefore, the essentiality for
    promising extensive research is required for more advanced, very cost-effective
    light-emitting and photon receiving detectors. The less expensive, tiny in size,
    less power consumption, and high compatibility with neighboring optical network
    UVLC claim the most significant wireless carriers. The traditional acoustic and
    RF wireless candidates are lagging behind for underwater signaling with low data-rate
    (few kbps); therefore UVLC fills the gap (Mbps to Gbps data transmission rates)
    of desired communication. In more contrast, the IoUT networks support the mobility
    of the devices in a very divisive medium within 3D channel coverage. Plenty of
    UWC applications enabled with ROVs, UUVs, and AUVs are widely employable with
    VLC format. The hybrid communication systems with 5GB networks are capable of
    connecting an enormous number of devices on terrestrial to underwater-based internet
    connecting things for further exploration of unguided oceanic sectors. The predictable
    scenario is establishing the underwater environment of the satellite becoming
    a universal digital communication sphere. As a substitute, UVLC supports high
    data rates (3Gb/s DMT VLC transmissions) [340] over short distances with low latency.
    SECTION XV. Conclusion UVLC approach builds up a wireless connection between terrestrial
    and floating nodes in an underwater environment. The possible solution to cope
    with the challenges and affecting factors of signal propagation are widely studied
    in this research. UVLC has become the most significant trade for signaling in
    aqueous mediums towards the futuristic 5GB wireless networking systems. The most
    recent advances through the current project schemes all around the globe to enhance
    the interest in marine industries along with various underwater applications are
    the main perspectives. The UVLC technological critics of signal propagation and
    channel impairments are the main issues due to the various types of underwater-based
    hybrid communication scenarios are summarized in this paper. Additionally, the
    architectural design of UWNs with higher modulation techniques is quite challenging
    to deploy over long-range communication in marine industries. Due to this, the
    different types of hybrid communication approaches are investigated according
    to requirements and geographical environments. The IoUTs play an ample role as
    a backbone in communication among transceivers. In the IoUT networks, the modems
    may contain some advanced signal tools for the purpose of achieving reliable high-data
    rates with diminishing influential factors such as noise and channel impairments
    in the correspondence of physical layers. This study contributes the solution
    of various range of channel impairment challenges and provides an overview of
    the latest projects schemes along with the future perspectives towards the 5GB
    networking system in this particular domain. Authors Figures References Citations

    systems (CPS) have revolutionized the engineering paradigm with profound applications
    in many aspects of society including homes, energy, agriculture, health-care,
    transportation, business, and manufacturing. A CPS uses suitable computational
    techniques such as game theory to enable different entities to interact with one
    another for taking necessary actions to obtain selected objectives. Recent literature

    I. Introduction Cyber-physical systems (CPS) represent an emerging generation
    of engineered systems that are built from, and depend upon, seamlessly integrated
    computing, communication, and control technologies [1]. The first notion of CPS
    takes us back to 1941 when, soon after the invention of Z3, the first fully functional
    program-controlled computation machine was developed by Konrad Zuse for the survey
    of aircraft wings [2]. Later, in the 1990s, with the technological advances in
    sensors, instrumentation, networking, and embedded computing, much greater interest
    in enabling interactions between computational and physical systems began to emerge
    [1]. Around 2006, “cyber-physical systems” found its formal name at the National
    Science Foundation in the United States [3]. The widespread exploration of CPS
    is motivating customer-focused and intelligent solutions in many industries: from
    home automation [4], smart city [5], and energy management [6] to health services
    [7], transportation [8], agriculture [9], and entertainment [10]. Disruptive innovations
    have been possible in CPS due to their ability to enable interactions between
    different components within systems [11] with one another through digital platforms,
    e.g., blockchain [12], to make well-informed, real-time, and intelligent decisions
    in the physical world. This can be demonstrated via two simple examples: (i) In
    the energy sector, energy users with distributed energy resources - such as rooftop
    solar panels and batteries - can interact with one another in the virtual layer
    (digital platform) of a smart grid to decide on various energy trading parameters
    and exchange electricity with one another for the negotiated price over the distribution
    network (physical system) [13]. (ii) Similarly, in the transportation system,
    vehicles can interact with one another and with road-side intelligent nodes through
    a digital platform while on the road and can have real-time information on traffic
    and estimated travel time across different routes that enable them to take the
    best possible path (physical) to reach their destination. The usefulness of the
    CPS springs from their properties of interoperability, connectivity, networking
    capability, communication, decentralization, autonomy, and modularity [14]. Interoperability
    allows a CPS to exchange mutually understandable data between its components whereas
    connectivity between components via various communication protocols enables this
    exchange. A unique characteristic of CPS is their modularity which enables a CPS
    to change and reconfigure its response in accordance with the users’ needs and
    convenience. For that purpose, a CPS — an interconnected network of components
    or subsystems — needs to have networking capability for all subsystems to interact
    with one another simultaneously to complete target actions without losing their
    autonomy in decision-making and decentralized control capabilities. This direct
    interaction of different components with one another for making real-time decisions
    characterizes the uniqueness of CPS [15] compared to traditional critical infrastructure
    systems. At the same time, it also poses the challenges of modeling the decision-making
    process of each agent within a CPS to maximize the combined benefits while maintaining
    system constraints [16]. In particular, in cases where rational agents with conflicting
    interests interact with one another, it becomes an extremely challenging task
    to model their complex interaction by deciding whether they should either cooperate
    or compete with one another to attain specific objectives. Examples of such objectives
    include, but are not limited to, reducing costs [17], maximizing revenue [18],
    balancing supply and demand [19], confirming reliability and security of the system
    [20], promote visibility and care [21], and ensuring the sustainability of the
    environment and system operation [22]. This necessitates such a decision-making
    process to be based on solid mathematical foundations that can ensure an efficient
    and secure operation of the CPS. Given this context, game theory is a natural
    approach to model interactive decision-making in CPS. Game theory is a formal
    analytical and conceptual framework with a mathematical toolset that enables it
    to model complex interactions among self-interested players [23]. It has been
    used in a wide variety of disciplines including economics [24], finance [25],
    operational research [26], energy [27], social science [28], political science
    [29], psychology [30], military [31], and retail markets [32] for several decades.
    In recent times, a large volume of interesting research has also been reported
    in the literature focusing on game-theoretic approaches for CPS [33]. Since the
    types of CPS are diverse due to their difference in applications and the pattern
    of agents’ interactions within each system, the key research question that arises
    is whether it is possible to grasp the entire scope of how game theory can be
    used to model the operation of CPS. To answer this question, this paper provides
    a comprehensive understanding of the state-of-the-art game-theoretic research
    in the area of CPS to help researchers: 1) to conduct new research requiring agent
    interactions within the CPS, 2) to be prepared to address new challenges that
    may arise in CPS, 3) to design and implement operational algorithms for CPS that
    are efficient and cost-effective, and 4) to develop new services that can be offered
    by CPS. By presenting clear insights into the recent advances in the game-theoretic
    study of CPS, this article can be helpful for new researchers in the area of energy,
    engineering, economics, signal processing, medicine, agriculture, and transportation.
    The main contributions of the paper can be summarized as follows: We provide a
    detailed background of different types of CPS and their general structure. We
    comprehensively discuss different types of game-theoretic approaches that are
    suitable for and have been used in CPS research. We identify and explain the relevance
    of game theory for CPS given their various characteristics. We review how game
    theory has been used in different areas of CPS research. We identify and discuss
    a number of challenges for future CPS implementations that can be addressed by
    using game theory. We note that there are several recent survey papers that are
    relevant to CPS research. For example, in [16], the authors have discussed how
    game theory can contribute to shaping the future of peer-to-peer energy sharing
    in the electricity market. The operational requirements of communication networks
    for electric system automation are featured in [34]. In [35], the authors have
    provided an overview of CPS research from a closed-loop system perspective. A
    comprehensive overview of the properties of CPS and guidance on how a CPS architecture
    can be tailored from a provided framework are discussed in [36]. The Reliability
    and security issues of CPS are surveyed in [37], [38], and [39]. A review of blockchain-based
    security and operation of CPS is given by the authors in [40] and detailed explanations
    of the relevance of CPS for industrial processes can be found in [41]. Clearly,
    these reviews have contributed significantly to the body of CPS knowledge giving
    researchers a good understanding of various aspects of CPS. Their foci are either
    on a specific area of CPS such as energy systems and industrial CPS or on a particular
    property of a CPS such as security. Thus, they are more suitable for readers who
    have some prior knowledge of different types of CPS and their characteristics.
    This paper, on the other hand, is written for readers with no (or very limited)
    knowledge of CPS and applications of game theory in CPS research. Therefore, we
    first provide readers with necessary background information on different types
    of CPS and their general structure. Then, after a discussion of some elements
    of game theory, we illustrate why game theory is one of the most relevant approaches
    to deal with challenges in CPS research and how existing studies have utilized
    it. Further, this paper differs from existing review articles in terms of the
    arrangement of contents, the focus of discussion, and the identification and explanation
    of future challenges. We note that experienced researchers will also benefit from
    this work to enhance their comprehension of the topic. The rest of the paper is
    organized as follows. In Section II, we provide a comprehensive background on
    CPS followed by a review of different game theoretic approaches in Section III.
    The relevance of game theoretic approaches in CPS research and a detailed overview
    of applications of game theory in various CPS research are given in Section IV.
    Finally, the paper is concluded in Section V. SECTION II. Overview of Cyber-Physical
    Systems As an emerging research area, investigations of CPS involve multiple overlapping
    disciplines of science and engineering. Consequently, the formal definition of
    the CPS has also evolved based on different perspectives from different scholars.
    In [42], CPS is defined as a technical platform where physical processes affect
    computations through a feedback loop and vice versa [43]. The authors in [44]
    defined CPS as a network physical engineering system that monitors and controls
    the operations of physical systems through computations. In summary, a CPS is
    a system that features a compact combination of, and coordination between physical
    systems and digitally networked systems [45] through a feedback loop. In this
    paper, we formally define CPS as follows: Definition 1:A CPS is a system that
    brings both a physical system and a digital (or cyber) networked system together
    under the same framework, where the activities in the physical system can be monitored,
    analyzed, and controlled by the computational ability, agility, and adaptability
    of the digitally networked system, via communication through a feedback loop between
    the two systems. A completely autonomous CPS can learn from the surroundings and
    make decisions and operate independently in real-time, whereas a semi-autonomous
    system operates independently only in pre-defined conditions. A. Architecture
    The architecture of a CPS depends on its type and functionalities. However, according
    to the definition, each CPS, in general, needs to 1) create a digital twin of
    its physical structure for real-time monitoring and analysis, 2) have an intelligent
    control unit for estimation and decision-making, and 3) a unit for executing algorithms
    to execute the decision in the physical structure through a feedback control loop.
    To perform these regular applications, the architecture of a CPS has five levels,
    as shown in Fig. 1, irrespective of its specific type and purpose [46]. These
    are a smart connection level; a data-to-information conversion level; a cyber
    level; a cognition level; and a configuration level. FIGURE 1. This figure gives
    an illustration of how different levels integrate the cyber and physical spaces
    of an operational CPS - inspired by [46]. These levels enable CPS to collect real-time
    data from the physical world, construct cyberspace (digital twin), and provide
    analytics and computational capabilities in cyberspace to create control signals
    to manage the physical system for specific tasks and objectives. Show All 1) Smart
    Connection Level To create a digital domain of a physical system for monitoring,
    analysis, and decision-making purposes, the first step is to acquire accurate
    and reliable data from different components of the physical system [47]. For accurate
    collection and measurement, IoT has become popular as the data acquisition tool
    [48]. The concept of IoT is derived from networked smart devices [49], and an
    integrated IoT allows the monitoring and sensing of various environmental and
    mechanical parameters of a CPS in real-time, collecting the information accurately,
    and passing the information to the server through using appropriate communication
    protocols, e.g., 5G [50]. Two important factors need to be considered in the smart
    communication level of the CPS. First, considering various types of data that
    stem from different components of the CPS, a seamless and tether-free method for
    the acquisition of data needs to be established [51]. Second, secured communication
    protocols need to be confirmed for data transfer from the IoT devices to the server
    [52]. Further, selecting appropriate sensors (specifications) to collect data
    from different machinery and components is also important [46]. 2) Data-to-Information
    Conversion Level Timely access to data and information is the key to the success
    of any business and it is also true for the successful implementation of the CPS.
    Data conversion aims to discover correlations and hidden patterns with the purpose
    of extracting useful information. Collected data from different components of
    the CPS can be divided into three types [53]: structured data, semi-structured
    data, and unstructured data. For structured data, a distributed database system
    is used for management and storing purposes. To store unstructured data, Hadoop
    distributed file system and not only structured query language is popularly used
    [53]. Finally, semi-structured data are unified into a standardized format by
    extensible markup language and stored in either a relational database management
    system or distributed database system. To extract meaningful information from
    the acquired data, an effective data-to-information conversation level is needed.
    The most widespread technique is data mining [54]. In general, data mining techniques
    analyze large volumes of data to discover useful, interesting, and valuable structures
    [55]. Popular data mining techniques that have been used in the CPS include clustering
    [56], classification and regression [57], artificial intelligence [58], deep learning
    [59], Bayesian learning [60], and machine learning [61]. 3) Cyber Level The cyber
    level is the central information hub [46], where information is being pushed from
    every connected component within the network to form the digital twin of the physical
    structure [62]. According to IBM [63], a digital twin is a virtual representation
    of a system that is built and updated from real-time data and uses simulation
    [64], machine learning [65], and reasoning [66] to assist decision-making. Hence,
    all information is being managed, analyzed, and benchmarked in this level of the
    CPS which helps to optimize the decision made at the cognitive level. Unfortunately,
    this level is also the primary target of hackers and prone to security breaches
    [67]. As a result, the security of the cyber level is of paramount importance
    for a secured and optimal operation of the overall CPS [68], [69]. Extensive research
    on the cyber-physical system security has been reported for green buildings [70],
    smart grids [71], [72], [73], [74], [75], transportation systems [76], [77], [78],
    medical CPS [79], [80], [81], autonomous robot system [82], [83], [84], smart
    city [85], [86], [87], and smart agricultural system [88], [89], [90]. 4) Cognition
    Level This level of a CPS helps to take correct decisions about actions in the
    physical structure of the system. Decisions are taken based on comprehensive knowledge
    of the monitored system and the analyzed information at the cyber level [46].
    CPS addresses issues relevant to both human and artificial cognition. For example,
    CPS can take over particular cognitive tasks from the users, and through the exchange
    of information with them, it can produce the necessary useful outputs [91]. In
    doing so, the cognitive level relies on various computational models [45], develops
    algorithms [92], and produces control signals to execute various actions in the
    physical structure of the CPS. 5) Configuration Level Configuration level acts
    as a supervisory control of the overall CPS [46] that applies the corrective and
    preventive decisions taken in the cognition level to the physical space of the
    CPS. Thus, if there is any change in the circumstances in the physical space,
    it is monitored, recorded, and analyzed at the cyber level and subsequent necessary
    actions are planned at the cognition level. Then, to adjust the quality and efficiency
    required for the newly adopted circumstances, the configuration level executes
    necessary control actions in the physical space [93]. B. Attributes The five-level
    architecture empowers CPS with various attributes to efficiently function in different
    application domains. Examples of such attributes include adaptive control, data-driven,
    predictive maintenance, inter-connection between systems, Internet-of-Things,
    real-time monitoring and control, human-machine interaction, and security and
    privacy. 1) Adaptive Control Adaptive control can be defined as the ability of
    a CPS to modify its mode of action with the changing environmental factors to
    achieve the best possible outcome. For example, in medical CPS, respiratory modules
    are used to assist patients to breathe. These modules are capable of tracking
    time-varying target pressure, estimating the hose characteristics of the module,
    and adjusting the pressure over the hose according to the need of the patient
    [94]. In smart agricultural and autonomous robotic systems, applications of adaptive
    control can be found in irrigation and moisture distribution [95] and military
    surveillance and intervention [96] respectively. Similarly, adaptive control is
    used in green buildings for heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC)
    and lighting control based on occupancy [97], in smart grids for price-signal
    enabled demand response [98], in transportation for coordinated control of electric
    vehicles [99], and in manufacturing for laser welding and additive manufacturing
    [100]. 2) Data-Driven Since the beginning, data has been an integral part of the
    CPS. The working principle of a CPS revolves around interactions between the physical
    and cyber systems enabled by the flow of data between them. Thus, CPS can alternatively
    be defined as a data-driven system. The management, control, and performance of
    different subsystems in a CPS are therefore highly impacted by the data obtained
    from different relevant sources and a large number of data-driven techniques and
    algorithms have been proposed over the last decade. For example, in the smart
    grid, the security of the CPS is a major concern and data-driven approaches have
    been used to address this issue [101]. In green buildings, heuristic data-driven
    algorithms are used to control the set-point temperatures of air-conditioning
    systems based on environmental conditions and people’s preferences to reduce the
    electricity bill [102]. In [103], the authors have discussed the importance and
    use of IoT data for medical imaging, whereas similar applications of data in a
    smart city are shown in [104] and [105]. The extensive application of data has
    also been demonstrated in transportation systems [106], robotics systems [107],
    agricultural system [108], and industry 4.0 [109]. Another important aspect of
    these data-driven CPS is the reliability of the data. With the recent emergence
    of affordable sensors and sophisticated data acquisition systems along with better
    communication speed, it is now possible to collect the large amount of data produced
    by the inter-connected facilities of the CPS. For example, a single machine in
    a manufacturing plant can generate thousands of production and health monitoring
    information within seconds that can be translated to several trillions of records
    of data per year [110]. Since, these data are being used by the cyber and cognition
    systems of a CPS to have an overall understanding of the current state of the
    physical system, forecast the variation of different environmental parameters,
    and subsequently decide the action plans to control various appliances of the
    physical systems, the reliability of data is of paramount importance in CPS [111].
    Examples of recent research that discussed the reliability of data acquisition,
    data communication, and data processing in the CPS can be found in [112] and [113].
    3) Predictive Maintenance Extensive use of data enables CPS to perform predictive
    maintenance, which is a technique that utilizes data analysis tools and techniques
    to identify anomalies in the operation of different subsystems and estimate possible
    defects in equipment and processes to fix them before failure. Predictive maintenance
    has been successfully done in green buildings for HVAC and home automation systems
    using machine learning techniques [114] and found its application in medium voltage
    switch gear to enable energy and mobility revolutions in the smart grid [115].
    In the transportation sector, such as in railways, faults in the pantograph and
    catenary systems significantly increase the risk of fatal incidents. Periodic
    or post-fault maintenance of these systems is also expensive. Hence, by obtaining
    data from the railway, predictive maintenance not only reduces the cost of sustenance
    but also reduces the probability of casualty substantially [116]. Further applications
    of predictive maintenance can also be found in manufacturing plants. For instance,
    in [117], an online technique is developed for real-time anomaly detection of
    equipment in a manufacturing plant using hierarchical temporal memory that can
    learn and adapt continuously and robust to noise. Similarly, predictive maintenance
    can also contribute to improving the performance of the CPS in medical [118],
    agriculture [119], and robotics [120]. 4) Inter-Connection Between Systems An
    important trait of CPS is the interconnectivity between its different elements.
    In a smart city, for example, green buildings with smart building management and
    automation system are connected with one another and can share energy, water,
    and other resources among themselves [121]. An example of such a community is
    shown in Fig. 2. By communicating with one another, different agents within a
    CPS interact to achieve individual and collaborative goals by taking informed
    actions. In doing so, each may act selfishly and competes with other agents with
    limited or complete access to environmental information and others’ action plans
    to achieve its own objectives such as reduction in cost [122], balancing between
    demand and supply of resources [123], increase access to community resources [124],
    and improve communication for critical operations [125]. On other hand, agents
    may also work together and cooperatively take decisions to obtain goals that bring
    collective benefit to the overall CPS. Examples of such cooperation are available
    in green buildings [126], robotics [127], smart grid [128], transportation system
    [129], and manufacturing plants [130]. FIGURE 2. An illustration of how different
    green buildings of a smart city can be interconnected with one another and share
    resources among themselves for self-sustainability. Show All 5) Internet of Things
    The interconnection and transfer of data between different subsystems of CPS have
    been possible due to the emergence of IoT (Internet of Things). IoT can be defined
    as the wireless network that enables the pervasive presence of a variety of objects
    (or things) through Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) tags, sensors, actuators,
    and mobile phones and makes the objects interact with one another and cooperate
    with their neighboring objects to attain the common objectives [131]. The application
    of IoT is critical and extensive in the CPS. For example, IoT’s highly integrated
    and open nature is ideal for smart agriculture that enables integration of autonomous
    equipment from various organizations for irrigation, weather forecasting, and
    social media stream for rapid events including threats, floods, and earthquakes
    detection [132]. By providing a platform for communication between different appliances
    within green buildings, IoT can not only help the owners of the building to reduce
    the use of unnecessary resources and thus cost [133] but also enable them to share
    the unused resources with other peers within the community for better sustainability
    [134]. Typical examples of such roles of green buildings are found in smart cities
    [135] and smart grids [13]. In robotics, IoT has been proven to be essential for
    designing multi-robot systems in industrial and academic areas [136]. In particular,
    the localization of robots is more reliable when robots can cooperate with an
    IoT-based smart environment [137]. Further, detailed discussions on the application
    of IoT for manufacturing and medical services can be found in [138] and [139].
    6) Real-Time Monitoring and Control The use of IoT has made it possible for the
    CPS to monitor the function of its different subsystems in real-time, timely acknowledge
    the variations in environmental framework, and take perceptive and intelligent
    decisions accordingly. Through the use of digital twins, now it is possible in
    large manufacturing plants to scrutinize and mentor every stage of the production
    process to ensure mass production of high-quality commodities in shorter time
    frames [140]. Continuous monitoring of critical patients and providing real-time
    telemedicine services either onsite or remotely is also possible now in medical
    CPS. For example, in [141], the authors argue that telemedicine could be an effective
    way to improve the overall health care of cardiovascular disease with a reduced
    health cost, while [142] shows how real-time monitoring of patients conditions
    can save many lives through automatic management of oxygen saturation. Continuous
    monitoring of activities of different subsystems and control of their actions
    for more productive outcomes are also very common in green buildings [143] - for
    HVAC, lighting, and flexible appliances control; smart grid [144] - for auditing
    of phase measurement units and security; transportations [145] - for coordinated
    charging and discharging of electric vehicles; agriculture [146] - for adaptive
    irrigation; and robotics [147] - for localization and routing control. 7) Human-Machine
    Interaction Human-machine interaction (HMI) refers to the communication and synergy
    between a human and a machine that is usually done through a graphical user interface.
    The agent-based architecture of the CPS enables its different agents to directly
    communicate with humans to take instructions for accomplishing certain tasks.
    Extensive use of HMI can be found in medical CPS, smart grid, robotics, transportation,
    and manufacturing. In medicine, for instance, in [148], the authors present a
    touchless and gesture-based HMI framework for the operating room to enable surgeons
    to define a personalized set of gestures to control the arbitrary medical computerized
    systems. HMI also finds its application for smart grids where energy customers
    directly set their preferences over the web [149] to set parameters and preferences
    for participating in demand response programs. In robotics, HMI is used for designing
    rehabilitation robots and socially assistive robots to augment the efforts of
    caregivers, parents, and educators [150]. The practice of HMI can be found in
    developing automated vehicles [151] and digital twin-based smart manufacturing
    [152] in the domain of transportation and manufacturing respectively. Finally,
    HMI is also used in precision agriculture for the real-time display of various
    sensor data on temperature, humidity, and solar irradiation and enabling users
    to control the overall agricultural CPS [153]. 8) Security and Privacy Due to
    the highly interactive nature of the decision-making process and significant use
    of data, maintaining the security of the system and preserving users’ privacy
    have become major concerns for CPS. It is estimated in [154] that cybercrime will
    cost the world about $ 10.5 trillion annually by 2025. In particular, smart grids,
    smart cities, green buildings, medical facilities, agricultural farms, and manufacturing
    plants are most vulnerable to cyber attacks for extensive use of IoT, where controlling
    and monitoring are based on Internet-based protocols. As such to maintain the
    secured operation of CPS, novel preventive methodologies and security architectures
    are developed. For example, in [155], the authors demonstrated how artificial
    intelligence can be utilized as a key tool to save green buildings from cyber
    attacks. Artificial intelligence is also proven to be very effective in protecting
    smart grids, intelligent vehicles, and smart cities from hackers by developing
    adaptive baseline behavior models, effectively detecting new, unknown attacks
    by combining known and unknown data sets based on predictive analytics and machine
    intelligence, as discussed in [156], [157], and [158] respectively. Other examples
    of technical approaches that have been used to develop security measures for CPS
    include big data analysis [159], cryptography [160], machine learning [161], deep
    learning [162], and distributed ledger technology [163]. Importantly also, for
    making data available from CPS, and sharing, provably private transformations
    are required that retain data utility, a comprehensive survey of such relevant
    differentially private techniques for CPS is provided in [164]. A short review
    of the attributes of CPS that make game theory an appropriate tool to model its
    decision-making and control framework is given in Table 1. TABLE 1 Summary of
    Attributes of CPS That Make Game Theory an Appropriate Tool to Model its Decision-Making
    and Control Framework C. Types Different attributes enable CPS to operate in different
    application domains. Depending on these applications, there are different types
    of CPS that operate either independently or in a coordinated fashion to deliver
    services that are environmentally friendly, reliable, secured, efficient, agile,
    and cost-effective. The purpose of this section is to introduce the readers to
    selected CPS that have particularly found many game theoretic applications. 1)
    Green Buildings Green buildings - also known as smart or intelligent buildings
    - are buildings with capabilities to gather information and respond to it [165].
    With a major focus on sustainability, green buildings are equipped with modern
    technologies including 5G, artificial intelligence, Internet-of-Things (IoT),
    and cloud and edge computing that make them energy efficient and human friendly
    [166]. Like other CPS, the building management system (BMS) in a green building
    monitors the building’s health and environment in real-time through its data collection
    systems (IoT and sensors), measures the physical built environment, and sends
    data to its control center for analysis and operational control of the building
    [48]. Key mechanics that shift the building paradigm from ordinary buildings to
    smart buildings include 1) IoT for seamless integration and processing of building
    environmental parameters such as temperature, noise, humidity, electricity and
    water flow, human activity information, and estimation of energy usage [48]; 2)
    BMS for controlling building operation according to human needs and activities
    [167]; 3) Flexible loads for scheduling and administering of household activities
    [168]; 4) big data management for analysis and forecasting [169]; 5) artificial
    intelligence for automatic, well-informed, and real-time decision making [170];
    and 6) distributed energy resources for increasing use and management of green
    energy [171]. A graphical illustration of green buildings is shown in Fig. 3.
    FIGURE 3. This figure gives a graphical illustration of a green building. The
    building is equipped with flexible loads and distributed energy resources. The
    intelligent building management system received real-time information about the
    building’s environment through its IoT system and makes intelligent and real-time
    informed decisions using artificial intelligence techniques based on the received
    big data. Show All 2) Smart Grid A smart grid - also known as smart power grid
    [173] - utilized modern information technologies to deliver power more efficiently
    by responding to a large spectrum of conditions and events. According to the National
    Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) [174], the smart grid consists of
    seven domains including customers, markets, service providers, operations, bulk
    generation, transmission, and distribution (Fig. 4). The heart of the smart grid
    that reflects its properties as a CPS is the smart infrastructure system consisting
    of a smart energy subsystem, smart information subsystem, and smart communication
    subsystem [175]. The smart energy subsystem enables advanced power generation,
    distribution, and consumption. In contrast to the traditional power grid, the
    power generation and flow pattern are more flexible in the smart grid due to the
    integration of distributed energy resources [176]. However, flexibility in power
    generation also makes power flow control much more complicated. The role of the
    smart information subsystem is to provide advanced information management [177]
    including data modeling, information analysis, integration, and optimization,
    enables business settlement and transactions [178], and facilitate real-time monitoring
    and management of devices in the smart grid [179]. The smart communication subsystem
    of the smart grid provides the platform for connectivity and information transmission
    among systems, devices, and applications. The communication subsystem consists
    of different types of networks including enterprise bus, wide area networks, field
    area networks, and premises networks. For efficient operation of the smart grid,
    it is important that the communication subsystem supports the Quality of Service
    of data [180], is highly reliable with a high coverage [181], and guarantees security
    and privacy. FIGURE 4. This figure gives a graphical illustration of the conceptual
    model of smart grid as proposed by the NIST [172]. Show All 3) Intelligent Transportation
    Systems The idea of intelligent transportation systems was conceptualized and
    developed in the 1980s when cognitive information was incorporated into the road
    infrastructure and vehicle [182]. Since then, the transport sector has evolved
    immensely. In particular, as accidents and fatalities that are affecting both
    the economy and environment adversely in rising every year [183], the need for
    next-generation transportation systems in air traffic, car control, and railway
    leveraging advanced computing and sensing capabilities has increased significantly
    to improve safety and throughput. Now, intelligent transportation systems can
    enable vehicles to avoid traffic congestion [184], reduce energy and land consumption
    [182], improve driving control, safety, and security [185], act as a distributed
    energy resources to provide a balance between electricity demand and supply [186]
    and reduce cost (or, increase benefit) for the vehicle owner [187], and improve
    environmental sustainability [188]. Disrupting technologies and innovating tools
    that are contributing to revolutionizing the transport system for a safer and
    greener future include in-vehicle sensor technology [189], in-roadway sensors
    [190] and over-highway sensor technologies [191], IoT and cloud services [192],
    tools for big data analysis [193], artificial intelligence [194], traffic sensing
    technologies [195], distributed ledger technology for transportations [185], and
    vehicle-to-vehicle communication and network [196]. 4) Tele-Medical Systems Tele-medical
    systems are networked systems of medical devices that provide life-critical and
    context-aware services in hospitals for high-quality continuous care for patients
    [197]. For example, at present, the advancement in medical sensors, wireless sensor
    networks, and cloud computing has transformed the monitoring and computation processes
    of a stand-alone system to a remote monitoring system by overcoming the geographical
    barrier [198]. Thus, it is now possible to provide patients with both in-home
    and in-hospital care. The Tele-medical system also provides a platform for using
    necessary computational resources to make intelligent decisions about a patient’s
    conditions based on the analysis of the patient’s historic data from the digital
    record and real-time data from smart devices and bio-sensors based monitoring
    systems [199]. To successfully provide life-critical services, a typical Tele-medical
    system architecture consists of four layers [79] including a data acquisition
    layer, data concentration/aggregation layer, cloud processing, and storage layer,
    and action layer. The data acquisition layer is responsible for collecting patient
    medical information and passing this information to nearby computationally-capable
    devices. The data concentration/aggregation layer concentrates data from each
    device in the data acquisition layer, aggregates them, and sends them to the cloud.
    Cloud processing and storage layer securely store patient information in the cloud,
    process the data following the privacy-preserving procedure, and uses advanced
    analytics to support health professionals to make informed decisions about patients.
    Finally, the action layer provides either passive (ECG monitoring) or active actions
    (robot-assisted surgery [200]) for the medical treatment of patients. An overview
    of these four layers is shown in Fig. 5. FIGURE 5. This figure gives a graphical
    illustration of four layers of a Tele-medical system including data acquisition
    layer, data concentration/aggregation layer, cloud processing, and storage layer,
    and action layer. These layers enable a Tele-medical system to collect patient
    information, aggregate it, and process it to make actionable items to save lives.
    Show All 5) Autonomous Robotic Systems (UAV/UGV) Autonomous robotic systems such
    as unmanned air vehicles (UAV) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGV) are becoming
    very popular as the next generation CPS [201]. A UAV is commonly known as a drone,
    which can fly like an aircraft without any human pilot or any person on board
    [202]. UGVs, on the other hand, are robotic systems that operate on land without
    any onboard human operator [203]. Thus, as the term “unmanned” indicates, both
    UAV and UGV operate without an onboard human operator but may be controlled through
    a fixed control station [204]. Some unmanned systems also act completely autonomously
    without any human intervention during their operation [205]. Autonomous robots
    can travel either between two pre-defined points or need to adapt to the environment
    based on surrounding information to complete their mission. Hence, depending on
    application areas, autonomous robotic CPS are built upon simultaneous localization
    and mapping techniques [206], accurate data acquisition and processing units [207],
    machine learning and artificial intelligence computation tools [208], and secured
    and low latency communication and control procedures [209], [210]. The cyber domain
    and the physical domain of autonomous robotic CPS are tightly connected with the
    coupling effect. According to [211], the coupling effect can have two meanings:
    1) the macroscopical data that flows from the physical domain to the cyber domain
    for analysis and processing to take effects in the physical domain again; and
    2) the mutual reliance between different components in cyber and physical domains
    in a micro level. To implement a complete and operational autonomous robotic CPS,
    understanding these coupling effects is critical to smoothly operate UAV and UGV
    with constrained communication, computation, and control resources [212]. 6) Smart
    Cities A smart city, as the name implies, is an urban area that utilizes technologies
    to become connected and agile to address 21st-century environmental, social, and
    economic challenges and improve the quality of life of its citizens. It comprises
    of several CPS operating simultaneously to address the challenge of reducing infrastructure
    risk in the smart city [213], improving information and operational security [214],
    and making a balance between financial impact and operational and safety impacts
    on the people in the smart city [215]. The concept of a smart city encompasses
    a wide range of applications that constitute the backbone of any municipality.
    For example, a smart city should have access to the smart digital health system
    [216] fueled by modern bio-compatible and accurate sensors, advances in body area
    network [217], and reliable and ubiquitous communications [218]. To improve the
    safety of roads in a smart city and provide drivers with a more convenient driving
    experience, intelligent transportation has become an essential part of a smart
    city. Smart driving applications employ different technologies to evaluate the
    status of the road and traffic conditions and help the drivers with real-time
    status updates [219]. Smart transportation can also help drivers to find a cheap
    and vacant parking spot in a busy city [220]. A smart grid is another application
    domain within a smart city that improves the efficiency of power generation, distribution,
    and consumption with reduced costs, pollution, and positive environmental impact.
    Houses and buildings in smart cities are equipped with their own solar and storage
    systems and an implication of this adoption of distributed renewable resources
    is the increased use of real-time pricing [221], demand-response management [222],
    peer-to-peer energy sharing [223], and energy security [224]. Meanwhile, buildings
    in a smart city are expected to be green buildings with smart appliances, adaptive
    control systems, own energy generation and energy storage facilities, and necessary
    securities services [215]. Buildings are able to be connected to one another for
    sharing resources such as energy [13] and become self-sustainable as a connected-community
    [121] when needed. Finally, public safety service is another key focus of smart
    cities to ensure people’s security and safety - especially under unusual circumstances
    such as natural disasters and political unrest [215]. Firefighters, police, and
    medical staff should respond promptly when needed and provide the affected people
    with necessary services by using state-of-the-art technologies. However, in times
    when technologies are down due to a disaster, alternative solutions are needed
    for these emergency departments to communicate and offer services [215]. An overview
    of how such a diverse set of CPS can co-exist and work together to make a smart
    city operational is shown in Fig. 6. FIGURE 6. This figure gives an illustration
    of smart city. A smart city can be thought of as a collection of different CPS
    including green buildings, smart transportation, smart energy grid, and connected
    communities to ensure a safe, convenient, and prosperous urban experience for
    its inhabitants. Show All 7) Smart Agricultural Systems By 2050, the world population
    will exceed 9.0 billion [225]. To feed this huge number of people, significant
    challenges have to be overcome to achieve the desired level of agricultural productivity
    under stringent constraints of limited resources, less skilled labor, less arable
    land, and climate change. Precision agriculture [226] - a smart CPS-based farming
    practice - has emerged as one potential solution to address this grand challenge.
    Precision agriculture has embraced autonomous, data-intensive, and disruptive
    technologies to locate and quantify spatial variability of soils, develop tools
    to enable precision management of crop nutrition, and use the current exponential
    volume of data to make decisions about ‘site, plant, and animal-specific management
    decisions to improve efficiency, productivity, quantity, profitability and sustainability
    of agricultural production’ [227]. With the advancement of the Internet of Everything
    (IoE) [228], land becomes a substrate in smart agriculture where different kinds
    of sensors acquiring heterogeneous data are connected to the Internet through
    a rural network. The real-time collected data is stored in the cloud database
    and processed and analyzed to identify land characteristics and requirements.
    Then, appropriate decisions based on weather, site information, and market conditions
    are taken by the intelligent decision-making unit to send to either the domotic
    system [229] or the farmer in charge for action and treatment. 8) Industry 4.0
    By integrating innovating functionalities through IoT, IoE, big data analytics,
    cloud manufacturing, and fog computing, CPS has provided a great opportunity to
    build advanced industrial systems and applications - Industry 4.0 [46]. The Third
    Industrial Revolution of the late 1990s not only digitalized and automated industrial
    production through extensive applications of electronics and computers but also
    laid the foundation blocks for Industry 4.0. Facilitated by the Industrial Internet
    of Things (IIoT), artificial intelligence (AI), autonomous robots, and smart digital
    technologies, today’s Industry 4.0 creates a better interconnected, automated,
    and holistic manufacturing ecosystem, thereby offering higher efficiency [230],
    productivity [231], scalability and security [232], privacy [233], and the autonomous
    operation of production processes [234] by ensuring that different components
    including equipment, logistics systems, work-in-progress components, and others
    (including people) directly interact with one other to achieve collaboration.
    Therefore, cyber-physical systems are integral to achieving the vision of Industry
    4.0, as CPS couples the physical productions and operations with the cyber systems
    through big data, augmented reality, cloud computing, and IoT to enable the seamless
    exchange of real-time information and commands. SECTION III. Overview of Game
    Theoretic Approaches The five-level structure and subsequent attributes enable
    different CPS to take real-time decisions on their action plans through interaction
    between their different components [236]. Due to these interactive characteristics
    of CPS, game theory [237] has been extensively used in the past decade to model
    the decision-making behavior of rational agents within a CPS by capturing their
    both competitive [238] and cooperative nature of interactions [239]. Essentially,
    game theory is a mathematical tool that conceives social situations among rational
    players and analyses their strategies in competitive environments where the outcome
    of a participant’s action depends on the preferences and actions of other participants
    [240]. Applications of game theory can be found in economics [241], politics [242],
    engineering [243], defense [244], medical [245], marketing [246], and recently
    topics in the broader area of CPS [247]. Depending on how each player chooses
    strategies to optimize their objective, game theory can be divided into two categories:
    cooperative games and non-cooperative games. In general, cooperative games deal
    with a coalition of players and decide how players can appropriately divide the
    value of the coalition among themselves. Meanwhile, non-cooperative games study
    which moves players should rationally make. Further, some games can take the form
    of either a non-cooperative or a cooperative game depending on the modeling of
    players’ interactions. In this paper, we refer to such games as hybrid games.
    A. Cooperative Games Cooperative game theory analyses the behavior of rational
    players when they cooperate and articulates the formation of coalitions that strengthen
    the players’ standings in a game [235]. Both coalition games and Nash bargaining
    are considered cooperative games [16]. Coalition games study the formation of
    different types of the coalition of players within the game and their properties
    [16]. Commonly, a coalition game is expressed by the pair (N,ν) , where N={1,2,⋯,|N|}
    refers to the set of players who seek to form coalitions and ν is the value that
    players collectively receive for being associated with each coalition S⊆N . In
    the characteristic form of coalition game [235], the value ν of a coalition is
    set by the members of the coalition S and is not impacted by how the members in
    coalitions N∖S are structured. As shown in Fig. 7, coalition games can be classified
    into three types: canonical coalition games, coalition formation games, and coalition
    graph games. Another branch of the cooperative game - Nash bargaining - on the
    other hand, focuses on the terms and conditions that players are required to follow
    to form different coalitions [248]. FIGURE 7. This figure shows different types
    of coalition games including (a) canonical coalition game, (b) coalition formation
    game, and (3) coalition graph game. In a canonical coalition game, conditions
    for forming a grand coalition are the main focus of the study with a significant
    emphasis on how to stabilize the grand coalition. The formation of appropriate
    coalition structures and their properties are the foci of a coalition formation
    game. Finally, the coalition graph game establishes a grand coalition or a network
    of coalition structures using point-to-point communication between members of
    the coalition. This figure is inspired by Fig. 1 of [235]. Show All 1) Canonical
    Coalition Games Canonical coalition games have been widely formalized and meticulously
    understood. These games can be expressed with either a transferable utility (TU)
    or a non-transferable utility (NTU), in which the formation of a grand coalition
    of all players is never detrimental [16]. In other words, in a canonical coalition
    game, no group of players can less benefit by cooperating with one another compared
    to acting non-cooperatively. The main aims of coalition games are to study the
    properties of the grand coalition and determine how the profit resulting from
    cooperation can be distributed among the players in a fair manner [235]. The most
    common solution concept of canonical coalition game is the core [249], [250],
    which is directly linked to the stability of the grand coalition. Typically, the
    core of a canonical coalition game is a set of payoff allocations that confirms
    that no player will be better paid off by leaving the grand coalition N for another
    coalition S⊂N . However, it is not guaranteed that the core of a TU or NTU canonical
    coalition game always exists. In many instances, the core can be empty and the
    grand coalition is not stable. In these cases, alternative solution concepts such
    as the Shapley value and the Nucleolus are explored. The Shapley value [251] -
    introduced by the Novel Laureate Lloyd Shapley in 1951 [252] - was first characterized
    for TU canonical coalition games and later extended to NTU games. It takes into
    account the order in which the players in (N,ν) join the grand coalition. If the
    players join in a random fashion, for example, the Shapley value allows payoff
    to each player according to its expected marginal contribution when it joins the
    grand coalition [235]. Although the Shapley value is unrelated to the core in
    general, it lies in the core for convex games [249], [250]. Another popular solution
    concept for canonical coalition games is the nucleolus, which is proposed mainly
    for TU games [250]. According to this solution concept, each player is provided
    with an allocation that minimizes the dissatisfaction of the players from the
    allocation they can receive in a given game (N,ν) . The nucleolus of a canonical
    coalition game exists and if the core of the game is not empty, it is in the core
    [235]. The applications of the nucleolus are many in game theory. One prominent
    application in the area of CPS is planning the power system expansion [253]. 2)
    Coalition Formation Games The network structure and the cost to form coalitions
    have major impacts on the solution of the coalition formation game. Like canonical
    coalition games, coalition formation games can also be in characteristic form
    with TU or NTU. However, unlike canonical games, coalition formation games can
    also be in partition form [254] and the gains that a coalition offers to its members
    are limited by the cost of forming the coalition [255]. Due to this reason, the
    composition of a grand coalition is very rare. In a coalition formation game,
    the main aim is to study the coalition structure including coalition type, coalition
    size, and stability of the overall structure. Since a network topology can be
    affected by environmental changes, the variation in player numbers, change is
    the characteristics of each player, and other factors can alter the stability
    of the coalition [256]. For solution concepts of coalition formation games, modified
    Shapley value, core, and nucleolus are used. Shapley value is referred to as B
    value with the restriction property [235]. The restriction property implies that
    for finding the B value, one needs to proceed in two steps: first, if there are
    M=|M| partitions as results of the coalition formation game, consider each partition
    m∈M of the game and determine the Shapley value ϕ m of each partition of the coalition.
    Second, determine the B value as the 1×M vector ϕ of payoffs implemented via combining
    the resulted allocation of each partition [235]. However, the restriction property
    does not apply to the core or the nucleolus [235]. With B present, the core and
    the nucleolus depend on the values of coalitions B m ∈B and the values of coalitions
    that are not in B . Therefore, the analysis to find the core and nucleolus is
    more challenging than that of the Shapley value, the details of which can be found
    in [257]. 3) Coalition Graph Games In some scenarios, underlying communication
    between different components or agents within the CPS plays a major role to decide
    the utility and other characteristics of the game, for example, peer-to-peer energy
    trading in energy network [258]. Coalition graph game is ideal to model such scenarios
    with competitive players [259] by representing the connectivity between different
    players through graph [260]. In the graph form, a coalition game can be TU or
    NTU, but the value of a coalition is influenced by the external network structure.
    In particular, how different players are interconnected with one another strongly
    and significantly impact the properties and outcomes of the game [235]. The main
    aims of a coalition graph game are 1) to develop distributed algorithms for players
    who plan to build either a directed or undirected network graph and 2) to study
    the properties including stability and efficiency of the established network graph.
    In the course of finding solutions for graph games, Myerson analyzed situations
    in which communication between players is restricted in TU games [261] and introduced
    the graph-restricted game, where the outcome of a coalition is determined by the
    total payoffs obtained in the original game by its connected subcoalitions [262].
    Then, he proposed a solution concept - known as Myerson value [263] - for graph-restricted
    games. Myerson value is essentially the Shapley value of graph-restricted games
    that focuses on the player’s characteristic function as the Shapley value and
    on its communication graph at the same time. Later, the Myerson value was also
    characterized in terms of component efficiency and fairness [264]. 4) Bargaining
    Games Bargaining is an economic phenomenon that circumscribes negotiations, payoffs,
    and disagreement [265]. The modern theory of bargaining was proposed by John Nash
    in 1950 [266] as a two-player bargaining problem. In the Nash bargaining model,
    two players demand a portion of some commodity in different applications, e.g.,
    energy trading [267], communication channel and power [268], and electric vehicle
    charging and discharging [269]. According to the bargaining solution, if the total
    amount requested by both players is less than the available quantity, both players
    can have what they requested. On the other hand, if the total requested amount
    is greater than what is available, none of the players gets their desired goods.
    Different solution concepts are used for addressing bargaining problems. According
    to the solution approach proposed by John Nash [266], a bargaining solution should
    satisfy the properties of affine transformation invariant, Pareto optimality,
    irrelevant alternatives independent, and symmetrical property. The main principle
    of this solution is to maximize the product of surplus utilities of the players.
    Other bargaining solution concepts include Kalai-Smorodinsky bargaining solution
    [270] and Egalitarian bargaining solution [271]. The Kalai-Smorodinsky bargaining
    solution equalizes the ratios of maximal gains whereas by Egalitarian solution
    maximizes the minimum of surplus utilities. B. Non-Cooperative Games Non-cooperative
    games are the games in which no cooperation is allowed between players to support
    their decision-making process [272]. A M players the non-cooperative game can
    be expressed by its strategic form as {M,{ X m } m∈M ,{ U m } m∈M } , where M={1,2,⋯,M}
    is the set of players, X m is the strategy vector of player m , and U m is the
    utility that a player m∈M obtains for its choice of strategy x m ∈ X m [273].
    The most popular solution concept of a non-cooperative game is the Nash equilibrium
    [240]. According to [274], in a M player game, Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies,
    in which the actions of each player m∈M is its best response to the actions taken
    by the players in set M∖{m} . Formally, Nash equilibrium is expressed as a vector
    of actions x ∗ =[ x ∗ m , x ∗ −m ] such that U m ( x ∗ )≥ U m ( x m , x ∗ −m ),∀m∈M
    . x ∗ specifies a stable state of a non-cooperative game in which no player m∈M
    can increase its utility U m by taking an alternative action other than x ∗ m
    when the actions of players in set M∖{m} are fixed at x ∗ −m [16]. The non-cooperative
    game can be divided into different categories with distinctive attributes and
    we provide a summary of each category as follows. 1) Non-Zero Sum and Zero-Sum
    Games In a non-cooperative game, if one player’s gain (or loss) does not necessarily
    bring loss (or gain) to other players, the game is known as non-zero-sum game
    [275]. On other hand, in a zero-sum game [276], the sum of the objective functions
    of two players is zero - the gain of one player brings loss to another player
    and vice versa. Examples of non-zero and zero-sum games include the Prisoner’s
    Dilemma [277] and chess game [278] respectively. 2) Finite and Infinite Games
    A non-cooperative game is called a finite game if each player of the game has
    a finite number of strategies. That is, each player can choose an action from
    a finite set of alternatives. An example of a finite game is chess. Finite games
    are also known as matrix games [272]. If a game is not finite, it is an infinite
    game. In an infinite game, the rules are changeable and the objective is to keep
    perpetuating the game. An example of an infinite game is the pursuit of excellence.
    3) Deterministic and Stochastic Games A game is referred to as a deterministic
    game [279] is the players’ strategies lead to completely predictable outcomes.
    A good example of a deterministic game is chess - the rules are specified and
    no additional variables are involved that may lead to variation in outcomes. In
    a stochastic game [280], on the other hand, the outcome of at least one player
    of the game is affected by an additional variable with a known probability function,
    for example, poker tournaments. 4) Complete Information and Incomplete Information
    Games When all information including the players, their objective functions, and
    corresponding probability distribution regarding a game are known to all players
    it is called a non-cooperative game with complete information. otherwise, the
    game is called an incomplete information game. An incomplete information game
    is also known as the Bayesian game [281]. A Bayesian game consists of a set of
    players, a set of actions, types of players, a payoff function for each player,
    and probability distributions associated with the types. The solution of a Bayesian
    game is the Bayesian Nash equilibrium. A non-cooperative game reaches its Bayesian
    Nash equilibrium when each player chooses a strategy that maximizes the expected
    payoff considering the types and strategies of other players [282]. 5) Perfect
    Information and Imperfect Information Games Games with perfect information are
    associated with sequential non-cooperative games, in which all players know what
    actions are chosen by all other players in the past. It is important to note that
    only in sequential games players can have perfect information. It is important
    to note that perfect information is different from complete information. In a
    complete information game, every player knows the strategies and payoffs of the
    other players but they may not necessarily be aware of the actions taken by other
    players [283]. These types of games where players do not have perfect information
    about other players within the game are referred to as imperfect information games.
    6) Static and Dynamic Games In the static game, players concurrently choose their
    strategies without having any information about each others’ action plans. In
    dynamic games, however, players can choose their strategies more than once and
    during the decision-making process, each player can know about the previous strategies
    of other players. A branch of the dynamic game is the repeated games in which
    a fixed strategy game is played periodically [283]. In repeated games, before
    choosing a strategy at the beginning of each period, a player observes the decisions
    made by other players in previous periods and then decides his current strategy
    accordingly. C. Hybrid Games A hybrid game can be either a cooperative or a non-cooperative
    game depending on how players are interacting with one another to optimize their
    decisions. For example, a Stackelberg game [284], also known as leader-follower
    game [285], can be considered as both non-cooperative and cooperative game based
    on followers’ modes of interactions in response to leaders strategy. In [286],
    for example, the authors proposed a non-cooperative Stackelberg game in which
    followers of the game interact with one another non-cooperatively in response
    to the leader’s decision and reach a Nash equilibrium. Meanwhile, the authors
    in [22] approached the Stackelberg game as a cooperative game in which followers
    respond to the leader by forming a coalition with one another using a coalition
    formation framework to achieve their desired objectives. A demonstration of the
    Stackelberg game in both cooperative and non-cooperative modes is shown in Fig.
    8. Thus, the Stackelberg game and other games that follow a similar phenomenon
    in articulating players’ strategy can be considered as hybrid games. FIGURE 8.
    In this figure, we illustrate an example of how a Stackelberg game can be used
    as both cooperative and non-cooperative games depending on how different players
    interact and respond. In (a), all followers of the Stackelberg game collectively
    choose their strategies to respond to the leader of the game. Hence, this game
    refers to a cooperative Stackelberg game. In (b), however, each player independently
    responds to the decision made by the leader without collaborating with other players
    in the network. Hence, this game is a non-cooperative Stackelberg game. Show All
    SECTION IV. Game-Theory for Cyber-Physical Systems In CPS, due to high engagement
    between different components for making decisions based on real-time monitoring
    and control, and the criticality of adaptive control and predictive maintenance
    for the system’s operation, make game theory an ideal candidate to model the users’
    behavior within a CPS and capture their activities to achieve certain objectives.
    As such, what follows is an overview of how game theory has been extensively applied
    in different domains of CPS in the last decade. Further, the summary of the discussion
    is given in Table 2 and 3. TABLE 2 Summary of Applications of Game Theory in the
    Areas of Green Buildings, Smart Grids, Intelligent Transportation Systems, and
    Tele-Medical Systems TABLE 3 Summary of Applications of Game Theory in the Areas
    of Autonomous Robotic Systems, Smart Cities, Agricultural Systems, and Industry
    4.0 1) APPLICATION IN GREEN BUILDINGS In green buildings, the physical system
    consists of the structure of the building, appliances (HVAC, lights, washing machines,
    hot water systems, and refrigerators, etc) within the building, and other equipment
    such as solar panels and batteries. Smart appliances are connected together through
    various communication protocols through which they can communicate with each other
    and with the home automation system in real-time within the building. Through
    artificial intelligence, and machine learning techniques, the home automation
    system can extract useful information from various sub-systems of the buildings
    and analyze them in its digital twin where various game theoretic techniques can
    be used to make useful decisions on energy usage, cost of living, thermal comfort,
    home security, users’ privacy, and resource management and sharing. Thus, as a
    CPS, green buildings have all the attributes explained in Section II-B that enable
    game theory to be used to tackle several challenges of design and construction
    of the building, energy and comfort management within buildings, and sharing resources
    between buildings while maintaining security and privacy. a: CONSTRUCTION & INCENTIVES
    To better promote green building constructions, government incentives are widely
    adopted across the world. Game theory has been used to design the government’s
    reward and penalty evaluations to better promote green building development projects.
    For example, [287] developed a prospect theory-based evolutionary game model to
    investigate a suitable strategy for promoting green building construction using
    four scenarios and determined dynamic reward and static penalty as the best strategy.
    While government incentives are important, real-state developers need to comply
    with government regulations to come forward to construct green buildings. Through
    an evolutionary game framework, the authors in [288] showed that strong government
    regulations could be inefficient in motivating developers to achieve target green
    constructions, and therefore a balance needs to be achieved between regulation
    and builders’ own philosophy for encouraging sustainable building design [289].
    It is also important to manage conflicts in the construction contract, e.g. using
    game theoretic models [290], [291] while conforming to the architectural design
    [292] and understand occupants viewpoint about dwelling in green buildings [293]
    for better social acceptance. b: ENERGY USAGE & COMFORT The importance of game
    theory is also evident in modeling the synergy between different appliances in
    managing energy usage and comfort within buildings. For example, the main sources
    of energy usage in buildings are HVAC, lighting, and hot water systems. Fortunately,
    these are also flexible loads that open opportunities for energy conservation.
    However, for saving energy and efficient building operation, it is important to
    opportunistically control and optimize these appliances as well as perform necessary
    predictive maintenance. In [294], game theory is used with reinforcement learning
    to develop a technique that can determine suitable settings for a building’s HVAC
    system by updating and enhancing its knowledge about the best action for HVAC
    control under different conditions from historic information about weather conditions,
    the stochastic nature of the power grid operation, and human activities. A game-theoretic
    demand-side management technique for buildings is studied in [295] to reduce the
    peak-to-average ratio of a community in Sydney. The authors in [296] considered
    three scenarios based on occupancy within a building and showed that game theory
    can be effectively used to model the decision-making process of building owners
    and residents about participating in green retrofit projects. Further, a non-cooperative
    Stackelberg game that uses different discomfort and interruption indicators for
    controlling residential air-conditioning systems is proposed in [297] to reduce
    the electricity cost to the customers and maintain their thermal comfort. c: ENERGY
    SHARING Besides individual energy and thermal comfort management capability, another
    unique characteristic of modern buildings is the ability to communicate with one
    another for sharing resources [121]. The research in this area of research is
    diverse and substantial. For example, in [298], [299], [300], and [301], the foci
    of the research have been to design game-theoretic algorithms that will enable
    multiple green buildings within a community to share common resources such as
    renewable energy [298], [299] and battery capacity [300], [301] with one another
    to reach a solution that is beneficial in terms of improving sustainability and
    reducing the cost to all participating buildings. d: CYBER SECURITY Green buildings
    are prone to cyber-attacks. Hence, maintaining cyber security in green buildings
    is very important and game theory has been proven to be a useful tool for that
    purpose [302]. In particular, green buildings are equipped with wireless networks
    and IoT that are vulnerable to cyber-attacks. As such, a zero-sum game model is
    built in [303] to control the attack and enable the defense mechanism to realize
    secured transmission of information from sensors to the controllers. A similar
    application of game theory for CPS security can also be found in [304]. Nonetheless,
    to attack a building or similar CPS and achieve the desired physical disruptions
    in its operation requires the attacker a good understanding of the failure conditions
    of the system and its control principles. Therefore, to build a robust security
    system for a building, consideration of such issues is important. Meanwhile, it
    is also important to make a balance between the security of a building and the
    cost of implementing those security measures. A game theory-based method is modeled
    in [305] that considers the failure conditions of the system and its control principles
    while implementing the security measures. Further, defense mechanism policies
    against different types of attacks using a hybrid-stochastic game are proposed
    in [306] that balances the security overhead and control cost. Through game theory,
    green buildings also contribute to improving the energy efficiency of the modern
    smart grid by providing various energy management services as active prosumers.
    2) APPLICATION IN SMART GRID In the smart grid, resources used for the generation,
    transmission, and distribution of electricity, buildings, electric vehicles, and
    battery storage can be thought of as the physical systems of the CPS. These resources
    are mostly interconnected and can communicate with one another to make intelligent
    decisions [128] in order to attain individual objectives [273]. The decisions
    are taken in cyberspace, e.g., via game theory and distributed leader technology
    [307] using data-driven techniques based on big data from different subsystems.
    Different computational intelligence techniques are utilized for the decision-making
    process [308] and cloud-based information processing makes the decision-making
    faster and scalable [48]. Smart grid attributes such as IoT enable the controller
    to sense any changes in the environmental settings and access the internet of
    information to make predictive decisions about various parameters for adaptive
    control of the activities of various components within the system. Security and
    privacy are of paramount importance in a smart grid where real-time monitoring
    and control are strictly used for energy and thermal comfort management without
    compromising the privacy and security of the people. Users can actively participate
    in energy management through human-machine interaction and can influence the overall
    energy system behavior through social platforms [309]. The practice of game theory
    is extensive in the smart grid. Beginning from designing demand response management
    schemes, game theory finds its applications in developing transactive energy frameworks,
    implementing peer-to-peer energy sharing schemes, designing real-time pricing
    and incentive mechanisms, managing energy in microgrids, and providing solutions
    to maintain power system security and stability. a: DEMAND RESPONSE Demand response
    can be defined as the voluntary reduction or schedule of electricity use by customers
    with the purpose to keep the electricity grid stable by maintaining the balance
    between demand and supply of electricity. Direct involvement of customers in demand
    response makes game theory a perfect candidate to model the voluntary change in
    energy usage behavior by the people [310]. Now, demand response can be done either
    via direct control of customers’ load by the electricity operator [126] or through
    providing incentives to the customers through a real-time pricing scheme as explained
    in [311], [312], and [313]. In the direct control demand response scheme proposed
    in [126], the purpose of using a cooperative game is to minimize the cost of forming
    unions of multiple users and single retailer that enable residents to indirectly
    access the balancing market to reduce the risks and costs for the retailer. In
    indirect control, on the contrary, the use of game theory helps to optimize the
    scheduling of flexible loads [98], develop suitable incentives through dynamic
    pricing scheme [311], [312], and engage extensive customers participation in demand
    response [314]. Another alternative of demand response technique - known as negawatt
    [315] - has emerged recently and a cooperative game-based negawatt management
    is proposed in [316] to demonstrate how negawatt trading can bring financial benefits
    to the participating customers without any negative impact on the physical distribution
    network. b: TRANSACTIVE ENERGY Transactive energy and peer-to-peer energy sharing
    are the other two branches of the smart grid that have broad applications of game
    theory. Transactive energy uses economic and control techniques to manage the
    flow of energy within a power system. On the other hand, peer-to-peer energy sharing
    is a part of a transactive energy mechanism that helps prosumers in a community
    to share their surplus with other peers at a price negotiated by themselves. In
    both cases, prosumers’ flexibility in changing their energy usage behavior plays
    an important role where game theory has been used extensively. For example, a
    nucleolus-based cooperative game solution is proposed in [317] that utilized the
    flexible loads of prosumers and considers the uncertainties of renewable energy
    resources to manage energy in local communities. A Stackelberg game is used to
    develop a joint energy and reserve dispatch model in [318] to ensure the reliability
    of system operation under renewable energy uncertainty. To maximize the benefit
    of distributed energy resources for flexible prosumers in terms of procuring revenues
    by trading electricity in the market, the authors in [319] and [320] explore algorithmic
    and non-cooperative games respectively to realize suitable transactive energy
    frameworks. Other aspects of transactive energy and peer-to-peer sharing, in which
    game theory has been used extensively include regulation services [321], balancing
    supply and demand [322], reducing electricity cost [323], [324], peak load reduction
    [22], encouraging customer participation [325], security of energy transactions
    [326], and privacy-preserved energy trading for neighborhood area networks [327].
    c: PRICING Both demand response and transactive energy services necessitate the
    active participation of prosumers. A key incentive to motivate prosumers actively
    participate in energy management is an attractive pricing scheme. Consequently.
    designing new and fair pricing schemes has been a core focus of smart grid research
    for a long time using game theory due to its inherent ability to capture people’s
    rational behavior. For example, to assist the grid, a dynamic pricing profile
    using a non-cooperative game is proposed in [328] to engage prosumers to address
    the duck curve problem. With a similar purpose of helping the grid, a game theory-based
    dynamic pricing strategy is studied in [311] that not only achieves significant
    peak load reduction but also enables participating prosumers to achieve noticeable
    profits for participating in the demand response program. Similar dynamic pricing-based
    demand response programs can also be found in [312] and [329] that use Stackelberg
    game, and [330], [331] using non-cooperative Nash game. d: MICROGRID MANAGEMENT
    Another aspect of smart grids that finds considerable use of game theory is microgrid
    management including energy trading between microgrids and designing energy management
    services within a microgrid. In terms of energy trading, games that have been
    used include Stackelberg game [17], non-cooperative Nash game [332], multi-level
    interactive game models [333], Bayesian game [334], and cooperative game theory
    [335], [336]. For managing energy within microgrids, on the other hand, hierarchical
    decision-making processes are modeled in [337] and [338] using Stackelberg game
    theory for maximizing profits for different stakeholders within a microgrid including
    users, microgrid controller, and microgrid aggregators. For optimal dispatch of
    power within a microgrid, an evolutionary game is used in [339], whereas the authors
    in [340] use a population game for distributed control of microgrid with the same
    purpose of dispatching active and reactive powers. Finally, non-cooperative games
    are used in [341] and [342] for managing energy within microgrids considering
    the intermittent nature of renewable energy generation. 3) APPLICATION IN INTELLIGENT
    TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS As IoT and emerging computational techniques are revolutionizing
    the emerging technological realm, transportation networks and vehicles within
    the network are becoming smarter day by day. Innovation in personalized electric
    cars, heavy automotive vehicles, roadside real-time communication and monitoring
    devices, and intelligent transportation systems are contributing to moving people
    across the globe through safe, hassle-free, cost-effective, and efficient mobility
    options. Using real-time information on traffic conditions, weather and historic
    information of the driver’s driving patterns, the cyber unit of each vehicle is
    able to use game theory to calculate the safest and fastest route to its destination
    and adaptively change the routes as the data shows changes in the circumstance.
    For that purpose, all components of the intelligent transportation system need
    to be interconnected with one another through a smart communication system such
    as 5G, human need to interact with the vehicle directly, and each component of
    the CPS should have its own control unit to execute the action plan decided by
    its cyber unit in real-time. In particular, game theory has been heavily used
    for vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) [343] and vehicle-to-grid (V2G) [344] technologies
    for coordinating energy charging, discharging, and transferring of energy by different
    stakeholders. In V2V, for example, applications of game theory can be found in
    modeling electricity trading between electric vehicles [345] using a Bayesian
    game; autonomous V2V decision making in the roundabout using prisoner’s dilemma
    [346]; modeling lane-changing behavior of drivers using two-person non-zero sum
    game [347] with both complete and incomplete information; enabling longitudinal
    autonomous driving through Nash differential game [348], and allowing vehicles
    to offload their computation-intensive tasks to neighboring vehicles using Stackelberg
    game [349]. a: INTELLIGENT DRIVING Intelligent transportation system has other
    beneficial and intelligent attributes including autonomous driving capability,
    safe driving experience through real-time information processing, and cost savings
    through opportunistic use of its fuel. In [350], for example, the authors present
    a game theoretic traffic model that can be utilized to test and compare various
    autonomous vehicle decisions and control systems. To avoid unintentional congestion
    in data communication among autonomous vehicles, a bimatrix game is proposed in
    [351], which can effectively solve the performance bottleneck and optimize the
    process of communication. Similarly, a Nash differential game is used to address
    longitudinal autonomous driving for intelligent hybrid electric vehicles that
    ensures the safety, economy, and comfort of the riders are optimized. b: MONITORING
    & CONTROL However, such autonomous driving of vehicles relies on the real-time
    monitoring and accurate control of traffic conditions on road including vehicles
    and pedestrians. For example, with IoT and intersection controllers in place,
    traffic control in intersections can be managed properly through a cooperative
    game-enabled mechanism [352]. It is also possible to accurately manage the change
    of lane by autonomous vehicles on roads through stochastic game [353]. Vehicles
    can also interact with pedestrians for their safe navigation through the road,
    as proposed in [354] using an empirical game theory. c: ENERGY SERVICE V2G, on
    the contrary, is being used for providing regulation services to the grid, coordinated
    scheduling of charging and discharging of electric cars, facilitating peer-to-peer
    energy sharing within communities, planning for future smart cities, and demand
    response management purposes. For instance, a non-cooperative Stackelberg game
    and a potential game are formulated in [344] to motivate electric vehicles to
    provide frequency regulation services to the power grid. Meanwhile, game theory
    is utilized in [355] to provide voltage regulation services to the grid. Topics
    on coordinated scheduling of charging and discharging of electric vehicles are
    studied in [356], [357], [358], and [273] using Stackelberg and coalition games,
    while it is shown in [359] and [360] that different game theoretic approaches
    also have the capacity to enable electric vehicles to participate in peer-to-peer
    energy sharing. Other applications of V2G for providing energy services can be
    found in [361] and [362]. We further find the use of different games in the context
    of V2G in infrastructure planning projects for charging and discharging in smart
    cities [357], [363] and demand response management using electric vehicles [364],
    [365]. 4) APPLICATION IN TELE-MEDICAL SYSTEMS In a tele-medical system, the physical
    system includes the hospitals with a patient monitoring unit, tele-consultation
    interface, and sensory units consisting of an ECG sensor, medical super sensor,
    motion sensor, and EMG sensor. The data collected by these sensors are transferred
    through a wireless local area network (WLAN) to a collector where the data is
    converted into useful information. This information is processed in the cloud-based
    medical server from where doctors can access the data and remotely help the patient
    in real time. The details of the architecture of tele-medical system can be found
    in [366]. The key attributes of tele-medical systems include real-time monitoring
    and control, the use of IoT to enable data-driven decision-making, human-machine
    interaction, maintaining the security of the interconnected system, and preserving
    the privacy of patient information. The use of game theory in tele-medical CPS
    stems from their applications in diagnosis and treatment. In particular, game
    theory has been used for building efficient healthcare IoT, optimizing the diagnosis
    and treatment process, and building trust between doctors and patients. a: EMERGENCY
    SERVICE In critical medical emergency situations, for example, health monitoring
    systems in wireless body area networks need to send data packets with critical
    health information with less processing time than regular health care information.
    In [367], the authors demonstrate that evolutionary games can accelerate the process
    of critical data transfer in a priority-based time-slotted fashion. The importance
    of low latency data transmission is also recognized in [368], which focuses on
    fog-based Internet-of-Health Things and proposes a weighted majority game theoretic
    approach for selecting fog devices in indoor and outdoor regions for delay-sensitive
    health care system. A similar application of game theory in health care IoT can
    also be found in [369]. b: DIAGNOSIS & TREATMENT Game theory has also been proven
    very effective in optimizing the diagnosis and treatment process of different
    diseases. In [370], for example, the authors explore game theory to develop a
    model the liver transplantation consultation for patients who suffer from Alcoholic
    Liver Disease. To enable privacy-aware medical imaging for patients’ treatments,
    a novel encryption method is proposed in [371] using Nash bargaining. Another
    image processing technique is proposed in [372] that uses a game theory-based
    meta-heuristic FIR filter to compress the medical image for online use. A cooperative
    game-based leukemia classification approach is proposed in [373] using a data
    set containing 400 samples of human leukemic bone marrow. A cooperative Bayesian
    game model is proposed in [374] to analyze the benefit of relying on a clinical
    decision support system for the overall reputation of a health facility. In [375],
    the authors model cancer treatment as a game and use an evolutionary game theoretic
    approach to decide the optimal amount of drug for chemotherapy. A review of studies
    that discuss how game theory has been used for cancer treatment can be found in
    [376]. c: TRUST MANAGEMENT Game theory also has a notable application in building
    trust between patients and healthcare systems. In particular, with the advancement
    of artificial intelligence in the health care system, the trust issue in medical
    consultation has become a concern for patients [377]. In [378], the authors use
    game theory to analyze and discuss how to establish continuity and trust in primary
    health care. And to build this trust, it is important that have a positive public
    opinion about the doctor-patient relationship. For that purpose, a tripartite
    evolutionary game is studied in [379] to examine the behavioral strategies of
    doctors, governments, and netizens, and analyze their impacts on the evolution
    of public opinion on the doctor-patient relationship. Finally, it is concluded
    in [380] that medical CPS is a disruptive approach to enable smart healthcare;
    however, the security and privacy of medical devices and low latency interoperability
    between them is critical for their sustainable operation in the diagnosis and
    treatment of diseases. Game theory can play a big role in that purpose as shown
    in [381] and [382] respectively. d: OTHER APPLICATIONS Another game-theoretic
    application in medical CPS can be found in analyzing the medical disputes among
    different levels of medical institutions [383], capturing strategic behavior of
    surgeons in operating rooms [384], quality maintenance of hospital medical equipment
    and pharmaceutical products [385], optimal scheduling of ambulance dispatching
    [386], sharing of resources (doctors) among hospitals [387], medical waste recycling
    and transportation [388], and for solving congestion in the plastic and reconstructive
    surgery match [389]. 5) APPLICATION IN AUTONOMOUS ROBOTIC SYSTEMS (UAV/UGV) For
    autonomous robotic systems including UAV and UGV, it is imperative for agents
    to interact with one another and with other entities of the environment with delay
    tolerant and efficient communication protocols for accurate routing, localization,
    and completing the target actions. Therefore, the physical architecture of the
    UAV and UGV consists of a central processing unit that controls the flight (or
    routing) of the UAV (or UGV). There is a ground control station that provides
    the human controller with facilities to access the control of the UAV/UGV during
    operation. Smart communication between the physical units and UAV/UGV is used
    for transferring the control signal from the station to the vehicles. The central
    processing unit analyzes the environmental data obtained from the UAV/UGV in real-time
    and process the data to generate secured control commands to feedback to the vehicles
    for execution. Thus, adaptive control, real-time monitoring and control, data-driven
    adaptive control, and security are the main attributes for the successful operation
    of UAV and UGV systems. For details, please see [390]. In this domain, game theory
    has been used for modeling the decision-making of and interaction between agents.
    In this domain of CPS, game theory has been extensively used to (1) decide the
    optimal placement of UAV, (2) coordinate and control UAV and UGV, (3) save energy
    and power, and (4) ensure security. a: COMMUNICATION SERVICES For providing communication
    services to the UGV on the ground, the UAV height has an impact on the service
    quality and coverage. It is important that they are positioned appropriately so
    that the number of UAV deployments can be reduced significantly to provide the
    desired network services. In [392], a non-cooperative game is used to find the
    optimal locations of UAVs for providing communication services, e.g., to a group
    of UGVs operating on the ground. In [393], the authors study the routing problem
    for multi-agent UAVs using game theory where a set of UAVs collect information
    via surveillance of an area of interest without relying on a reliable communication
    medium to coordinate with other UAVs. Similarly, in [394], an artificial intelligence-based
    game theoretic approach is proposed for UAVs to control their flight algorithms
    to position themselves in suitable locations to maintain strong connectivity.
    Details of how joint coverage and connectivity for distributed UAV networks can
    be facilitated via game theory are detailed in [395] and [391]. Note that the
    communication platform provided by UAVs enables the coordination and control of
    both UAVs and UGVs, as shown in Fig. 9. FIGURE 9. This figure shows how multiple
    UAVs can coordinate with one another to provide a platform for communications
    between UGVs to operate on the ground. This figure is inspired by the discussion
    in [391]. Show All b: SURVEILLANCE Coordination between UAVs and UGVs using their
    real-time spatial and temporal locations and electromagnetic information is important
    for their path planning and obtaining intended objectives with the desired efficiency.
    For example, in [396], a game theory-based optimization technique is proposed
    for path planning for multiple UAVs to improve the mission efficiency and range.
    A similar approach is used for recurring scenarios in [397], in which the coordination
    among robots with shared objectives are analyzed using a potential game. The alliance
    between UAV and UGV is studied in [398] for cooperative surveillance using a co-evolutionary
    algorithm that prioritizes early detection and improves the success rate. A dynamic
    multi-team antagonistic game is proposed in [399] for multiple UAVs to solve problems
    of tactical decision-making with incomplete information. Other examples of game
    theoretic coordination of UAV and UGV can be found in [400] and [401]. c: ENERGY
    EFFICIENCY Most of the unmanned vehicles are deployed in areas that are not easily
    accessible by humans due to either locational hazards (e.g., mountains and forests)
    or security threats (e.g., battlefield). As a consequence, frequent replacement
    of the batteries of the robots is not feasible. Hence, it is important to optimize
    the operation and maintenance of UAV and UGV for efficient and opportunistic use
    of energy. In fact, UAV cooperative control has been used in many UAV communication
    networks such as in [402] where a potential game is used for the purpose of power
    control. For the purpose of increased battery life, delay-aware and energy-efficient
    task management techniques for IoT platforms for UAV and UGV are studied in [401],
    [403], [404], and [405] that use joint-auction coalition game, non-cooperative
    game, coalition formation game, and non-cooperative matching game with no-regret
    learning respectively to develop the mechanisms. Further discussion on how game
    theory can be used to ensure energy-efficient activities of UAV and UGV can be
    found in [406]. d: SECURITY In autonomous robotic CPS, game theory has also been
    utilized extensively for modeling and analyzing the cyber-physical security of
    time and location-critical UAV and UGV applications. One general way to design
    such game theoretic formulation is to model the interaction between a UAV (or
    UGV) operator and an interdictor where each of them could be benign or malicious
    [407]. The solution of the game is then analytically studied to understand its
    effects on the rationality and strategies of both parties and find the equilibrium
    points under different selected security regimes. A dynamic game approach for
    preparing a secured and resilient networked system is proposed in [408] and demonstrates
    its effectiveness for a UAV network. For securing transmission in a two-tier UAV
    network, a two-level game based on a many-to-one matching game and a coalition
    formation game is implemented in [409] that guarantees the desired secrecy performance
    of the system. UGV in the defense force sometimes faces the threat of intelligent
    autonomous adversaries to disrupt the transfer of resources [410], e.g., by manipulating
    the signals in the GPS. To address this challenge, a Stackelberg game-theoretic
    countermeasure is proposed in [411] to develop new security solutions against
    the such attack and tested on UAV networks. Another example of game theoretic
    application in a similar domain can be found in [412] that uses an interdependence-aware
    game-theoretic framework for compensating the power losses that could cause due
    to an attack by the malicious agents within the network. 6) APPLICATION IN SMART
    CITIES A smart city, as depicted in Fig. 6, is a platform that integrates different
    types of CPS together to efficiently manage assets, resources, and services within
    urban areas to improve its overall city operations. Thus, the architecture of
    a smart city is alike to the one shown in Fig. 1 with all attributes outlined
    in Section II-B. The smart city architecture and attributes enable the collection
    and flow of data across different CPS, and then process and analyze the information
    for monitoring and managing power plants, traffic and transportation systems,
    water supply systems, waste management systems, health systems, community service
    systems, and maintaining the security of the citizen. Due to the scale of operation
    in a smart city, the management of data is challenging, and game theory has been
    proven to be very effective. In [413], for example, a Stackelberg game is utilized
    to design an intelligent edge computing algorithm that can alleviate the huge
    computing pressure from smart cities as the number of data increases day by day.
    Another game theory-based edge computing technique is proposed in [414]. In particular,
    an evolutionary game is used to qualitatively study the validity and stability
    of the trust management mechanism for smart cities. While most of the smart city
    activities have been explained as part of different CPS in this paper, waste management
    and security surveillance are exclusively relevant to the smart city. a: WASTE
    MANAGEMENT The seamless flow of data across different agents within the smart
    city enable game theory to contribute to waste management systems. For example,
    In [415], the authors identify the decision behaviors of contractors using an
    evolutionary game for better construction and demolition of waste management.
    In particular, the authors discuss how the decision of contractors can be influenced
    in different circumstances and identify the main factors that have impacts on
    their decision-making process. For example, it is shown that supervisory intensity,
    supervision costs, penalties, waste disposal costs, and revenues from illegal
    dumping are the major element that regulates government and contractors’ initiative
    regarding waste management. In [416], the authors propose a technique that can
    help analyze different express packaging waste recycling models for smart cities.
    With the purpose to contribute to designing effective incentive measures and recycling
    models, this work uses a differential game to understand the behavioral characteristics
    of individuals and different types of recycling models. It is identified that
    a cooperation-driven recycling model can have the highest revenue and subsidies
    are necessary for improving recycling in the smart city. b: SECURITY Security
    is another crucial component for the smart city considering its reliance on data-driven
    infrastructures [417]. In terms of maintaining privacy and security in the smart
    city, game theory has been used for ensuring the security of critical infrastructures
    like smart grids [418], gas and water systems [419], traffic systems [412], and
    IoT [420]. In [418], a dynamic multi-stage game is developed using reinforcement
    learning to identify the optimal attack sequences for given objectives to help
    to improve the security of the system. A non-zero-sum game is proposed in [419]
    which identifies that the interdependence of power systems on natural gas and
    water systems of the city may influence attackers to target water and gas systems
    for a cyber attack. Therefore, appropriate security measures need to be taken
    for these critical infrastructures as well. In [412], a Stackelberg game is used
    to optimally allocate the backup power sources for base stations to ensure uninterrupted
    services to power and transportation sectors of the smart city in case there is
    a power interruption due to a cyber attack in the smart grid. Finally, a repeated
    game-based enhanced clustered WSNs-based IoT security is proposed in [420] to
    combat selective forwarding attacks and thus preserve network stability. A detailed
    overview of the importance of game theory for cyber security can be found in [421].
    7) APPLICATION IN SMART AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS Smart agricultural system consists
    of a sensor layer, which can be thought of as the physical system of the CPS.
    This layer includes various kinds of crop sensors and smart objects responsible
    for real-time data collection and monitoring. Occasionally, thermal drones may
    also be used for detecting heat from objects and materials used for agricultural
    purposes. The smart connection between different components is provided by the
    network layer with communication technologies available between sensors and the
    Internet. The IoT platform utilizes a wireless sensor network for large-area surveillance
    and helps the farmer to maintain the optimal condition for maximum productivity.
    The service layer of the smart agricultural system serves as the cyber and cognition
    levels of the CPS. This layer is responsible for the processing and analysis of
    collected data for taking optimal decisions about agricultural plans. The data
    processing unit and decision support system of the service layer manage the collected
    information from the fields and take decisions for optimal crop yield, resource
    savings, and quality assurance. Finally, the application layer mimics the configuration
    level which enables farmers to take necessary actions by providing visualization
    of information and suggesting different kinds of field optimization deployments
    including irrigation, pesticide drift control, cultivation process, and crop disease
    protection. Further details of the architecture can be found in [422]. Considering
    the applications of different layers, the main attributes of a smart agricultural
    system include adaptive control, IoT, real-time monitoring and control, interconnectivity,
    predictive maintenance, and human-machine interaction, which make game theory
    a suitable tool to apply for modeling smart agricultural activities. The Exploration
    of game theory for innovative agricultural practice is diverse - starting from
    the selection of agricultural crops as proposed in [423] in 1962 to today’s challenge
    of water allocation for agriculture purposes [424]. For the agricultural CPS,
    in particular, game theory finds its main applications in two areas: smart farming
    and water management. a: SMART FARMING In smart farming, farmers have better control
    over the cultivation process including animal husbandry, crop diseases, pest control,
    moisture control, and weather prediction through real-time monitoring of crops,
    an inspection of irrigation equipment, and predictive maintenance of the crops
    and field as required. Game theory has been used considerably for these purposes.
    In [425], for example, a smart farming technique is proposed using a cooperative
    game that enforce farms to cooperate together for better performance and solving
    problems with defective farms. A perfect information non-cooperative game with
    a hierarchical structure is developed in [426] to demonstrate how the production
    efficiency of multiple farms can be affected if some farms may choose to deviate
    from their strategies after the game reach a Nash equilibrium. Blockchain-based
    trust management for agricultural green supply is designed in [427], in which
    the authors use a Bayesian game to ensure the data reliability provided by different
    sensors. For agricultural land fragmentation, a non-cooperative game is proposed
    in [428] to establish the finding that if a government wants to manage agricultural
    land fragmentation, similar strategies should not be chosen for all agricultural
    lands. Finally, how grain production management can be used to reduce global warming
    under financial constraints and the time value of money is studied in [429]. In
    particular, the authors developed an evolutionary game to evaluate the performance
    of financially constrained producers when they adopt a sustainability strategy
    while considering the government’s long-term cap-and-trade regulation. b: WATER
    MANAGEMENT Another important attribute of agriculture is the water management
    system. In fact, agriculture is the largest consumer of water [430], and a water
    management system is responsible for administering water across different lands
    or scheduling the flow of water for the same land for irrigation purposes. Sharing
    a body of water for agricultural practices raised conflicts between farmers for
    centuries, some of which have been captured in game theory for developing water
    management solutions. Several kinds of literature in the eighties and nineties
    addressed various water management problems among different farms. For example,
    the authors in [431] suggest an oligopoly model to set the definition of the equilibrium
    on water volume to find a solution to the irrigation problem. In [432], the problem
    of pumping water from a common aquifer is modeled using differential open loop
    and feedback games. It is demonstrated that dynamic inefficiency increases as
    more landowners have access to the aquifer. Combining game theory with policy
    analysis, the authors in [433] investigate how irrigation institutes influence
    the distribution of equilibrium outcomes of irrigators. Today, the management
    of water for irrigation still remains a challenge as part of the smart agricultural
    CPS. In [434], Wald’s maximin model of game theory is used for modeling the decision-making
    process in farming irrigation systems considering uncertainties. A Bayesian game
    theory is used in [435] to develop an intelligent IoT irrigation system that carries
    out cruise irrigation based on humidity information and a path planning algorithm.
    Finally, a detailed discussion on farmers’ cooperation in participatory irrigation
    is given in [436], in which game theory is used to identify that local funds may
    incentivize farmers to cooperate together to make participatory irrigation sustainable.
    8) APPLICATION IN INDUSTRY 4.0 According to [437], the architecture of Industry
    4.0 consists of all levels depicted in Fig. 1 and subsequently possesses all desired
    attributes articulated in Section II-B. As a result, as other CPS discussed in
    this paper, the game theory also has increased applications in the area of manufacturing
    - in particular for quality assurance, sustainable manufacturing, and production
    certainty in Industry 4.0. a: QUALITY ASSURANCE Irrespective of the product type
    - whether the plant is for the healthcare service or food quality assessment,
    for example - game theory has found its application in all sectors of manufacturing.
    In healthcare service, for instance, an equilibrial service composition model
    in cloud manufacturing is proposed in [438]. In the proposed model, both cooperative
    and non-cooperative games are used to model the interaction between manufacturing
    cloud service providers and consumers to ensure improved quality of services based
    on consumers’ needs. In the sports industry, game theory is used in [439] to provide
    efficient services in the sports arena. In particular, a two-player game-based
    model is formulated for efficient decision-making by monitoring officials utilizing
    IoT-based data on athletes’ performance. For smart food quality assessment, a
    game theory-based framework is established by [440]. In the framework, a Bayesian
    game is explored to develop a computing platform for quantifying the probability
    of food quality using IoT-based data from restaurants and food hubs. b: SUSTAINABLE
    MANUFACTURING In the fashion industry, shoes and clothes are being shifted towards
    sustainable manufacturing - the culture of throwing away products is replaced
    by responsible consumerism. However, this practice is yet to be adopted by the
    manufacturing farms with large-market shares. In [441], the authors have discussed
    how different types of game models can effectively capture the engagement of different
    stakeholders to practice sustainable product usage and how that can impact the
    apparel industry. Evolutionary game theory is being used in [442] and [443] to
    understand how the Government’s regulation and enterprise decisions can affect
    the manufacturing industry and select the green and low-carbon innovation in manufacturing
    enterprises. c: PRODUCTION CERTAINTY & OTHERS To reduce the supply chain risk
    and uncertainties of producing customized products, a three-level game theoretic
    model is proposed in [444] in the area of crowd-sourced manufacturing. This study
    models interactive decisions that determine the optimal solutions for a single
    manufacturer, multiple distributors, and multiple subcontractors by confirming
    that all stakeholders’ profits are maximized. Among other manufacturing industries,
    the use of game theory can be found in cellular manufacturing systems (using a
    cooperative game [445]), cloud manufacturing (using a minority game [446]), vaccine
    manufacturing (using an evolutionary game [447]), warehousing industry (using
    a cooperative game [448]), and prefabricated building project (using an extensive
    form game [292]). SECTION V. Proposals for Future Research Based on the discussion
    in this paper, it is clear that the properties of CPS and how different types
    of CPS are contributing to changing our lives are well demonstrated in the existing
    literature. On the one hand, CPS like tele-medicine systems, smart grids, smart
    agricultural systems, and autonomous robots offer facilities including emergency
    diagnosis and treatments, electricity, sustainable food supply, and defense against
    the enemies that are critical for our survival. On the other hand, the amenities
    and convenience offered by green buildings, intelligent transportation systems,
    industry 4.0, and smart cities make our lives spontaneously easy and rewarding.
    We have seen in our discussion - also summarized in Table 1 - that the characteristics
    of CPS are well aligned with the properties of multi-agent systems. Therefore,
    the usefulness of outcomes of various CPS is contingent on the interaction between
    different agents and their interactive decision-making models. Given this context,
    game theory has found profound applications in CPS research and has been used
    extensively in the literature - as compiled in Table 2 and Table 3 - to address
    miscellaneous decision-making and control challenges. However, albeit the contribution
    of game theory in the CPS research to date is voluminous, there are a number of
    potential challenges that are yet to solve - particularly lying in innovative
    ways to merge the roles of different CPS for the greater good. These challenges
    are encapsulated in the following discussion. A. Connected Community While green
    buildings are capable of optimally managing their own resources as well as sharing
    some of their resources with neighboring buildings, how such individual and collective
    management of resources can be exploited to benefit other CPS needs to be investigated.
    For example, as buildings are responsible for 60% of total electricity consumption
    [48], collectively they could be very useful for providing demand flexibility
    to the grid. However, this would necessitate multiple buildings to cooperate with
    one another and act as a connected community [121], which is challenging given
    the fact that building owners are self-interest entities. Game theory could be
    a potential tool to model such a scenario. For example, either coalition formation
    or a potential game could be used to encourage coalitions among different green
    buildings to exploit their elasticity in managing distributed energy resources
    to provide demand flexibility to the grid. B. Intelligent Transportation for Medical
    Purposes Emergency response is a crucial part of medical CPS and intelligent management
    of ambulances is vital for this service. In an emergency, it is not only important
    that ambulances are dispatched as a priority but also choosing the optimal path
    to reach the patient at the earliest possible time is also essential. Making ambulances
    parts of intelligent transportation systems could be one potential solution to
    increase the efficiency of medical services. In that case, ambulances will be
    able to interact with other intelligent vehicles on road, information hubs, and
    satellite navigators to find the optimal route to reach their destination and
    help save millions of lives. For example, a Stackelberg game [284] can be used
    to model some scenarios in which ambulances - as part of the intelligent transportation
    system - will act as the followers of the game to optimize their reaction time
    and time delay to reach the destination in response to the medical emergency request
    issued by the medical CPS - modeled as the leader of the game. C. Interference
    in Autonomous Robotics Systems UAV-based networks are self-organizing networks
    that are prone to wireless interference. It is expected that a large number of
    UAVs and UGVs will be deployed for different tasks, which will intensify the challenge.
    Hence, new techniques will need to be developed to address interference management.
    One potential way is to use a mean field game to analyze the dynamics of a large
    number of interacting rational agents (i.e., UAV or UGV). Mean field game has
    the capacity to capture the stochastic nature of a system, e.g., channel dynamics
    of UAV-based network in this case, without the need for information exchange during
    the execution of the algorithm [391]. Therefore, it could be a suitable tool to
    model interference in UAV-based networks with limited backhaul and fronthaul connectivity.
    D. Reinforcement Learning for Smart Agriculture In reinforcement learning-based
    game theoretic models, an agent automatically learns from its past experience
    and environment and utilizes the feedback to strategically decide on its action
    to optimize its objective. Thus, such a technique is very suitable for smart agriculture
    to reduce the impact of the uncertainty of weather conditions, the pattern of
    weed attacks on the crop, market volatility, and local demand for food on farming.
    Further, such a model could also be useful for learning the best way to distribute
    water among different farms and eventually improve the performance in every session
    to optimize the use of water. E. Resource Recycling in Smart Cities As discussed
    earlier, a smart city could be thought of as a platform in which different types
    of CPS exist together. While it is a challenging task to maintain all the resources
    needed by different systems simultaneously, it also opens opportunities to recycle
    some of the resources within the smart city. For example, if UAVs are primarily
    used for goods delivery purposes [460], it could be also possible to opportunistically
    use these UAVs for providing security services to the city [461]. This will not
    only help the city to save significant costs but also reduce the waste material
    in the long term for the betterment of the environment. Nonetheless, it is a significant
    challenge to model the opportunistic use of resources for different purposes,
    which can be modeled via resource-sharing games like cake-cutting or cooperative
    games. F. Knowledge-Based User Motivation for Smart Grid In the future, prosumers
    will play a major role in smart grid energy management. Hence, it is important
    for energy users to learn about the future energy transition and equip themselves
    with the knowledge and skills that are needed to be a part of this transition.
    This is mainly because people’s perspective about technology and using capability
    can significantly impact the uptake of a new technology [462], [463]. Therefore,
    a significant amount of research needs to be devoted to preparing courses and
    training modules targeting different classes of people to educate them about future
    energy transition, its importance, and how it is going to impact the environment
    and people’s life in the future. SECTION VI. Conclusion In this paper, we have

    Digital twin can be defined as a virtual representation of a physical asset enabled
    through data and simulators for real-time prediction, optimization, monitoring,
    controlling, and improved decision making. Recent advances in computational pipelines,
    multiphysics solvers, artificial intelligence, big data cybernetics, data processing
    and management tools bring the promise of digital twins and their impact on society
    closer to reality. Digital twinning is now an important and emerging trend in
    many applications. Also referred to as a computational megamodel, device shadow,
    mirrored system, avatar or a synchronized virtual prototype, there can be no doubt
    that a digital twin plays a transformative role not only in how we design and
    operate cyber-physical intelligent systems, but also in how we advance the modularity
    of multi-disciplinary systems to tackle fundamental barriers not addressed by
    the current, evolutionary modeling practices. In this work, we review the recent
    status of methodologies and techniques related to the construction of digital
    twins mostly from a modeling perspective. Our aim is to provide a detailed coverage
    of the current challenges and enabling technologies along with recommendations
    and reflections for various stakeholders. A working digital twin of an offshore

    wave of digitalization, the latest trend in every industry is to build systems
    and approaches that will help it not only during the conceptualization, prototyping,
    testing and design optimization phase but also during the operation phase with
    the ultimate aim to use them throughout the whole product life cycle and perhaps
    much beyond. While in the first phase, the importance of numerical simulation
    tools and lab-scale experiments is not deniable, in the operational phase, the
    potential of real-time availability of data is opening up new avenues for monitoring
    and improving operations throughout the life cycle of a product. Grieves [1] in
    his whitepaper named the presence of this virtual representation as “Digital Twin”.
    Since its presence among the most promising technology trends in Gartner’s recent
    report [2], the Digital Twin concept has become more popular in both academia
    and industry (e.g., see [3] for a non-exhaustive glimpse at the major patented
    developments), apparently with many different attributes to include or exclude
    in its definition. For example, Hicks [4] differentiates a digital twin from a
    virtual prototype and redefines the concept as an appropriately synchronized body
    of useful information (structure, function, and behaviour) of a physical entity
    in virtual space, with flows of information that enable convergence between the
    physical and virtual states. According to the authors in [5], digital twins represent
    real objects or subjects with their data, functions, and communication capabilities
    in the digital world. Although the first mention of the word digital twin can
    be traced back to only the year 2000 when Grieves mentioned it in the context
    of manufacturing, without a formal mention, several industries and organizations
    had been exploiting the idea at varying levels of sophistication. Some examples
    of these are the log of patients health information and history tracking, online
    operation monitoring of process plants, traffic and logistics management, dynamic
    data assimilation enabled weather forecasting, real-time monitoring systems to
    detect leakages in oil and water pipelines, and remote control and maintenance
    of satellites or space-stations. More recently, the necessity to formalize and
    utilize the full potential of digital twin concepts arises from a combination
    of technology push and market pull. While the need for online monitoring, flexibility
    in operation, better inventory management and personalization of services are
    the most obvious market pull, availability of cheap sensors and communication
    technologies, phenomenal success of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence
    (AI), in particular, Deep Learning (DL), new developments in the computational
    hardware (Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) and Tensor Processing Unit (TPU)), cloud
    and edge computing are certainly the major technology push. In this regard, it
    will not be an overstatement to say that the digital twin concept is going to
    bring revolution across several industry sectors. The topic of digital twin is
    so diverse and complicated such that it is almost impossible to cover all its
    aspects in a single article. The current paper, therefore, is an effort to present
    a reasonably comprehensive overview of the concept from a purely modeling perspective.
    In doing so we plan to answer the following questions: What is a digital twin?
    Is digital twin a new concept or has it existed with different names in the past?
    What values are expected out of the digital twin concepts? What are the major
    challenges in building digital twins? What are the existing and emerging enabling
    technologies to facilitate its adoption? What will be the social implications
    of this technology? What is expected from relevant stakeholders to extract maximum
    benefits from the digital twin technology? In Fig. 1, we give a taste of what
    a state-of-the art digital twin of an offshore oil platform looks like. The digital
    twin is continuously updated with sensor data in near real-time. The sensor data
    can be augmented with synthetic data generated from simulators which bring physical
    realism at high spatio-temporal resolutions. The digital twin does not only give
    real-time information for more informed decision making but can also make predictions
    about how the asset will evolve or behave in the future. In an ideal setting,
    a digital twin will be indistinguishable from the physical asset both in terms
    of appearance and behaviour with the added advantage of making future predictions.
    In fact the digital twin shown in Fig. 1 also gives the possibility for humans
    to interact physically with the asset using an avatar. Based on our literature
    survey we also came across the term digital siblings. Digital siblings can be
    considered as copies of the physical asset which need not necessarily run in real-time
    but can be used to test out hypothetical scenarios for “what if ?” analysis and
    risk assessment. FIGURE 1. A working digital twin of an offshore oil platform.
    Screenshot from Kongsberg Digital’s Dynamical Digital Twin for oil and gas, demonstrating
    interlinked 2D process diagrams and 3D visualizations of an oil and gas production
    facility enriched with real-time data from the asset. The color on the pipes shown
    in the 3D rendering can be used to show data such as flow rates, water / gas /
    oil fractions etc. The Dynamical Digital Twin can also run and explore what-if
    scenarios generated by process simulators in which case it will be more appropriately
    called a Digital Sibling. Copyright Kongsberg Digital 2019. Show All We now start
    this paper with a brief description of eight values (Section II) that any digital
    twin is capable of generating followed by a presentation of the state-of-the-art
    technology in five diverse application areas (Section III). Common challenges
    across these application areas are identified in Section IV. To address these
    challenges, certain enabling technologies are required. Some of these technologies
    already exist but most of them are at different stages of development. A comprehensive
    overview of the enabling technologies is presented in Section V followed by a
    section on the socio-economic impacts of the technology (Section VI). Finally,
    the paper concludes with reflection and recommendations targeted towards five
    distinct stakeholders. SECTION II. Value of Digital Twin Building up on a report
    from Oracle [6], the following eight value additions of digital twin are identified:
    Real-time remote monitoring and control: Generally, it is almost impossible to
    gain an in-depth view of a very large system physically in real-time. A digital
    twin owing to its very nature can be accessible anywhere. The performance of the
    system can not only be monitored but also controlled remotely using feedback mechanisms.
    Greater efficiency and safety: It is envisioned that digital twinning will enable
    greater autonomy with humans in the loop as and when required. This will ensure
    that the dangerous, dull and dirty jobs are allocated to robots with humans controlling
    them remotely. This way humans will be able to focus on more creative and innovative
    jobs. Predictive maintenance and scheduling: A comprehensive digital twinning
    will ensure that multiple sensors monitoring the physical assets will be generating
    big data in real-time. Through a smart analysis of data, faults in the system
    can be detected much in advance. This will enable better scheduling of maintenance.
    Scenario and risk assessment: A digital twin or to be more precise a digital sibling
    of the system will enable what-if analyses resulting in better risk assessment.
    It will be possible to perturb the system to synthesize unexpected scenarios and
    study the response of the system as well as the corresponding mitigation strategies.
    This kind of analysis without jeopardizing the real asset is only possible via
    a digital twin. Better intra- and inter-team synergy and collaborations: With
    greater autonomy and all the information at a finger tip, teams can better utilize
    their time in improving synergies and collaborations leading to greater productivity.
    More efficient and informed decision support system: Availability of quantitative
    data and advanced analytics in real-time will assist in more informed and faster
    decision makings. Personalization of products and services: With detailed historical
    requirements, preferences of various stakeholders and evolving market trends and
    competitions, the demand of customized products and services are bound to increase.
    A digital twin in the context of factories of the future will enable faster and
    smoother gear shifts to account for changing needs. Better documentation and communication:
    Readily available information in real-time combined with automated reporting will
    help keep stakeholders well informed thereby improving transparency. SECTION III.
    Diverse Applications of Digital Twin Five diverse applications of a digital twin
    are selected to get an in-depth understanding of the state-of-the-art, common
    challenges, corresponding solutions and future needs to bring more physical realism
    into it. A. Health Health care is one of the sectors which is going to benefit
    the most from the concept of digital twin. The emergence of smart wearable devices,
    organized storage of health data of individuals and societies, need for personalized
    and targeted medication and inter-weaving of engineering and medical disciplines
    are the major driving forces for the realm of smart and connected health. Psychologists
    have begun to use physical activity levels using actigraphs to predict the onset
    of different episodes of bipolar disorder [7]. Fernández-Ruiz [8] suggests combining
    computational simulations with tissue engineering for more reliable, successful
    and predictable clinical outcomes. In [9], the authors give insight into how a
    digital twin framework for remote surgery might look like. Bruynseels et al. [10]
    projects digital twin as an emerging technology building silico representations
    of an individual that dynamically reflects molecular status, physiological status
    and life style over time. Zhang et al. [11] gives an overview of the latest developments
    in organ-on-a-chip (OOC) engineering. OOC synthesized from the tissues of a patient
    offers an alternative to conventional preclinical models for drug screening. The
    chip can replicate key aspects of human physiology crucial for the understanding
    of drug effects. By combining several such OOC one can generate a full body-on-a-chip
    (BOC). Skardal et al. [12] gives the progress made in this direction. Although
    both OOC and BOC are seen as disruptive technologies in the context of digital
    twin (or digital sibling to be more precise), in the more near future a digital
    twin of human body can be worked out using most of the technologies and data already
    available. To begin with, the health care system in developed countries already
    has recorded health history of its inhabitants. However, one issue is that this
    monitoring is not regular and a big chunk of the young population is left out
    because they visit physicians only when sick. To this end, the data collected
    by smart wearables might hold huge value since it can help balance the database
    enabling longitudinal studies. Furthermore, in the presence of a digital twin
    of the human body of a patient, a surgeon can already train himself even before
    physically conducting the surgery. However, for the digital twin to be a reality
    there are many technical, ethical and privacy issues that should be resolved.
    Physical models for biochemistry, fluid and nutrient transport, and other mechanistic
    models are required to better simulate the internal working of a human body (organs,
    blood flow, signal transmission etc). The authors in [13] explained a “computational
    man” vision, which is a dynamic fast-running computational model of major physiological
    systems, such as the circulatory, respiratory or excretory system in a human body.
    In the prototype for remote surgery [9], the authors highlighted the importance
    of low latency, high level of security and reliability hinting at how important
    roles communication technologies (like 5G) and cybersecurity (encryption technologies)
    are going to play. Efficient Computer Aided Modeling (CAM) and Virtual Reality
    (VR) will also be instrumental in this context. Jimenez et al. [14] also advocated
    building digital twin technologies in medicine (see, for example, [15], [16] for
    a detailed description of medical cyber-physical systems). Kocabas et al. [17]
    detailed such medical cyber-physical system considering the layers of data acquisition,
    data preprocessing, cloud system and action module. The secure integration of
    wireless body area networks (WBAN) with cloud computing platforms and Internet
    of Things (IoT) networks has been considered as another major challenge in healtcare
    applications [18]. B. Meteorology The meteorological institutes all over the world
    have been using the concepts of digital twin extensively. They utilize solid models
    of a region (terrain, buildings), high fidelity physics simulators and big data
    coming from multiple sources to provide both long and short term weather prediction
    which are ultimately communicated using stunning rendering of the numerical results
    via web browser, television or mobile applications (see, for example, [19]–[21]).
    The big data (terrain data, satellites, masts, radar, radiosonde, sea buoy, drones,
    LIDAR) handled in meteorology is characterized by the high 4Vs (volume, velocity,
    variety and veracity). In this application area, one can find some of the most
    advanced methods for big data assimilation in massively parallelized numerical
    simulators capable of operating in real-time, and excellent long-term and well
    documented data archival and retrieval mechanisms. One of the reasons for the
    immense success of the digital twin concept within the field of meteorology is
    a relatively much lower bar regarding privacy and confidentiality of the data.
    There is a lot to be learned from this field. While it will not be an exaggeration
    to term weather forecasting as the most matured digital twin concept, there is
    still enough scope for improvements with relative ease. The meteorological services
    have poor quality in those locations throughout the world where there are not
    enough weather stations or observation data. The precision meteorology aims to
    improve weather forecasting by updating predictions through numerical modeling,
    data collection, data analytics, and technology adoption enhancement. A greater
    than ever penetration of smartphones in almost all societies has remained an underutilized
    technology. By 2020 there will be more than 6 billion smartphones in the world.
    Compared to the paltry 10,000 official weather stations this number is huge. Each
    smartphone is equipped to measure raw data such as atmospheric pressure, temperature
    and humidity to access atmospheric conditions. While the analysis of data from
    only a few phones might not yield much, analysis of data from billions of phones
    will certainly be game changer. In fact Price et al. [22] has already demonstrated
    the use of smartphones for monitoring atmospheric tides. Nipen et al. [23] has
    recently shown the value of crowd sourced data in improving operational weather
    forecasts. In weather and climate centers, large volume and large variety observational
    data streams have been used to improve our knowledge of the current state of the
    atmosphere and ocean, that provide an initial condition for forecasts of future
    states. As an integrated approach, observing system simulation experiment (OSSE)
    systems mimic the procedures used to analyze such satellite, balloon, or surface
    tower observations for specifying states of the atmosphere [24]–[28]. An OSSE
    can be considered as a digital twin to use computational models to test new systems
    before their physical prototype is actually built or deployed. It is anticipated
    that in the future such OSSE techniques will be applied to diverse domains with
    the use of increasingly advanced and sophisticated simulations of nature and observations
    [29]. A near real-time weather forecast is a must for environmental situational
    awareness for improved decision-making scenarios [27]. Examples include, but are
    not limited to, air traffic management, severe-weather watch, wind-turbines adaptation,
    and so on. To achieve so, an increasing number of observations should be assimilated
    instantaneously since the lifespan of many weather phenomena can be less than
    a few minutes. Solving a purely physics based model with the required resolution
    while being compatible with the time-scales of natural phenomena might be prohibitive.
    Therefore, a parallel accelerated digital twin, capable of duplicating the physical
    system with acceptable accuracy, could offer a realistic solution to assimilate
    these short-time observations. The role of this twin is to give quick guidelines
    whether or not a decision needs to be taken. This is specifically important with
    the intrinsic stochastic characteristics of weather systems, and hence the model
    should be able to monitor those seemingly-random sequential observations [30]–[32].
    Data-driven tools do an excellent job in terms of online time-cost, however relying
    only on data and disregarding the known and well-established physics is not a
    wise step. Hybridization techniques have been demonstrated to give superior performance
    to either of the individual components alone. Therefore, a digital assimilation
    twin can be built to provide nature-informed indicators for near-time events.
    Besides, to test new models and assimilation tools before adopting them into current
    operational platforms, they need to be tested with some synthetic observations
    simulated from realistic nature runs (NR) [29]. To maintain a realistic benchmark,
    these NR should mimic the natural phenomena with their respective time-scales
    and provide timely observations. ML and AI tools have shown extraordinary performance
    learning from available data. Supplying a digital twin with sufficient amount
    of real (noisy) data and posing the well-established physical constraints can
    provide a trained and informed nature replica with realistic stochastic behavior.
    In particular, this stochasticity is important for testing the predictability
    of extreme events that usually occur without previous long-term indicators [33]–[35].
    C. Manufacturing and Process Technology Manufacturing and process technology industries
    have a history of exploiting the digital twin concepts without explicitly mentioning
    it. However, with the current trend of digitalization and demand for customized,
    high quality products in highly variable batches with short delivery times, the
    industries are forced to adapt their production and manufacturing style. In this
    regard, even these industries are reevaluating the digital twin concepts and are
    trying to include latest enabling technologies (discussed later in Section V)
    in their workflow. According to a report by BCG [36], Industry 4.0 is seen as
    the convergence of nine digital technologies: big data and analytics, cybersecurity,
    industrial IoT, simulation, augmented reality, additive manufacturing, advanced
    robotics, cloud services, horizontal and vertical system integration. Borangiu
    et al. [37] stresses the importance of cloud services in the context of resource
    virtualization as an enabler for Factory of the Future (FoF) known by different
    initiatives Industry 4.0 (Germany), Advanced Manufacturing (USA), e-factory (Japan)
    and Intelligent Manufacturing (China) but similar goals. Mukherjee and DebRoy
    [38] and Knapp et al. [39] proposed a conceptual framework of a digital twin for
    3D printing. In their models, the computationally demanding mechanistic models
    (for heat transfer, fluid flow and material deposition and transformation) are
    certainly the bottleneck. By providing an overview of the historical perspective
    on the data lifecycle in manufacturing, in [40] and [41] the authors highlighted
    the role of big data in supporting smart manufacturing. The state-of-the-art of
    digital twin applications in industrial settings has been studied systematically
    in [42], where the authors concluded that the most popular digital twin application
    area is developing the advanced prognostics and health management (PHM) systems.
    A five-level cyber-physical system structure has been proposed specifically for
    PHM in manufacturing applications [43]. In determining the major concepts and
    key methodologies, the authors in [44] reviewed intelligent manufacturing systems.
    A functional mock-up interface has been offered as a tool independent standard
    to improve model-based design between the manufacturers and suppliers [45]. Such
    a platform independent co-simulation framework can be found in [46]. In [47],
    the authors detailed the use of functional mock-up units for the digital twin
    applications. A digital twin approach has been also highlighted in [48] as a real-time
    control and optimization tool towards individualized production systems. D. Education
    Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), which make university courses available for
    free or at a very nominal cost is a disruptive technology challenging traditional
    classroom teaching. In this paradigm change in pedagogy, we are undergoing a plethora
    of opportunities in personalizing education for a more effective teaching. Different
    students based on their natural talent, interest and backgrounds have different
    needs. Although universities and schools are recording more and more data about
    the students, the feedback loop is not complete. A digital twin for students will
    help counter this shortfall. With the emergence of artificial intelligence driving
    bots, personalized education and counseling will be more and more available at
    no additional cost. In fact, a brief discussion on the power of artificial intelligence-powered
    personalization in MOOC learning can be found in [49]. A personalized adaptive
    learning frameworks has been also constructed in [50] using a smart learning environment.
    In [51], the authors developed a smart education concept incorporating data mining
    tools. The role of IoT in constructing a smart educational process can be found
    in [52]. The authors in [53] explained the gradual progress from e-learning to
    m-learning (mobile learning), u-learning (ubiquitous learning), and s-learning
    (smart learning). In [54], the authors demonstrated a digital data management
    framework for accreditation purposes in order to help assessment process considering
    data collection, characterization, analysis and implementation. This might also
    help to map program’s educational objectives to student outcomes [55]. The authors
    in [56] discussed a set of demanding skills that are critically important for
    the emerging digital twin paradigm and highlighted relevant business model changes
    to accommodate with the Industry 4.0 digital revolution. The growing gap between
    industry and academia has been highlighted in [57], where the authors drew attention
    to tremendous opportunities from a data science perspective. Combining the digital
    twin of the education sector with that of other industrial sectors, it would be
    more efficient in grooming targeted talents. E. Cities, Transportation and Energy
    Sector The digital twin relevant technologies become more mature to offer smart
    solutions in construction, transportation and energy sectors. In [58], the authors
    studied a digital twin concept to engage citizens with city planning with an idea
    of pairing physical objects with their digital counterparts. The authors in [59]
    discussed the requirements of the scalable cloud model that can be used for smart
    cities. A collection of essays about Singapore, arguably considered the smartest
    city in the world, can be found in [60]. In his editorial note, Batty [61] discussed
    the progress towards digital twins concerning urban planning and city science.
    A smart city paradigm that can enable increased visibility into cities’ human-infrastructure-technology
    interactions has been explained in [62], in which spatio-temporal city dynamics
    was integrated into a data analytics platform at the real-time intersection of
    reality and virtuality. Smart grids use sensors and digital communications technologies
    to detect and react to local changes in power usage. A cyber-physical system perspective
    to the smart grid technologies can be found in [63]. The adaptation of the digital
    twin technology for applications in power system control centers has been recently
    studied in [64]. In [65], the authors used a faster than real-time digital twin
    in predicting dynamic behaviour of smart grid systems. In [66], the authors outlined
    a cyber-physical system approach to control large scale road freight transportation
    problems including minimized fuel consumption with integrated routing and transport
    planning. An integration approach between vehicles and mobile cloud computing
    has been discussed in [67]. A vision for the integration of cyberspace and physical
    space has been discussed in [68] to tackle some challenges in aviation industry.
    In [69], the authors provided a hybrid artifact solution for air traffic control,
    in which paper and digital media are identical and have equal importance, by suggesting
    tangible interaction and augmented reality. A discussion on digital artifacts
    related to simple examples of structural engineering can be found in [70]. The
    recent technologies related to the Industry 4.0 have been recently reviewed for
    oil and gas sector [71]. Highlighting the digital shift, the authors in [72] discussed
    the integration of such technologies for improving energy efficiency in smart
    factories with the aim of reducing both production costs and greenhouse gas emissions.
    Fault detection and diagnostics issues in built environment can be found in [73]
    towards improved Building Information Modeling (BIM) systems. As discussed in
    [74], BIMs constructed from a CAD model do not often capture details of a facility
    as it was actually built. In [75], the authors introduced BIM digital twins for
    better assessment and development of the design, construction and performance
    of residential buildings. A full scale digital twin of a district heating and
    cooling network aligned with the visions of Industry 4.0 can be found in [76].
    SECTION IV. Common Challenges As seen in the previous section, the concept of
    digital twin is already in use in several application areas, however, in order
    to make digital twins completely indistinguishable from their physical counterparts,
    many challenges have to be addressed. Digital twins should consider application-specific
    issues in terms of time critical, safety critical and mission critical services
    [77]–[81]. The feasibility and challenges of using a digital twin to perform functionality
    and cyber-security analysis is discussed in [82]. In a similar context, the authors
    in [83] provided a compound table that touches on the importance of major cyber-physical
    system challenges for various application domains. Their discussion includes detailed
    definition for interoperability (composability, scalability, heterogeneity), security
    (integrity, confidentiality, availability), dependability (reliability, maintainability,
    availability, safety), sustainability (adaptability, resilience, reconfigurability,
    efficiency), reliability (robustness, predictability, maintainability), and predictability
    (accuracy, compositionality). In [84], the authors discussed various signal processing
    related challenges in digital twin technologies. Strict requirements for explainability
    and the resulting data protection laws now require that the decisions that are
    made for human should be explainable to humans [85]. For example, human factor
    perspectives on auto driving systems can be found in a recent study [86]. With
    the rapid development of the AI technologies in mind, the moral machine experiment
    [87] provides many insights how machines might make moral decisions. In the context
    of the current paper we stress on challenges belonging to four categories that
    the modelling community should focus on. Firstly, the success of digital twin
    technology depends on a real-time two way connection between the physical asset
    and its digital twin to bring in physical realism without any compromises. Major
    challenges in ensuring this relates to spatio-temporal resolution of sensor data,
    latency in communication, large data volume, large data generation rate, large
    variety of data, large veracity of data and fast archival retrieval and online
    processing of data. Secondly, as the physical asset evolves in time it requires
    a corresponding evolution of the models while still maintaining backward compatibility.
    Thirdly, as most of the physical assets for which one can envision digital twins
    will require high level of safety and security, there will be a need for greater
    transparency and interpretability of the decisions taken based on digital twins.
    This will require models which are interpretable and physically consistent. Finally,
    the digital twin needs to be presented to the end user in a way that it appears
    indistinguishable from the physical asset and easier and intuitive to operate.
    All these challenges which require the immediate attention of the modellers are
    summarized in Table 1. In the next section we focus on enabling technologies that
    can have maximum impact on addressing these challenges irrespective of the application
    areas. TABLE 1 Mapping Between Common Challenges and Enabling Technologies SECTION
    V. Enabling Technologies It is quiet evident from the preceding section on common
    challenges that we need to develop technologies that will address those challenges.
    In this section we attempt to cover the enabling technologies under five major
    categories: physics-based modeling, data-driven modeling, big data cybernetics,
    infrastructure and platforms, and human-machine interface. The section is structured
    in way to address the challenges using various enabling technologies (see Table
    1 for an overview). A. Physics-Based Modeling So far, the engineering community
    has been driven mostly by a physics-based modeling approach (e.g., see Fig. 2
    for broader hierarchical stages). This approach consists of observing a physical
    phenomenon of interest, developing a partial understanding of it, putting the
    understanding in the form of mathematical equations and ultimately solving them.
    Due to partial understanding and numerous assumptions along the line from observation
    of a phenomenon to solution of the equations, one ends up ignoring a big chunk
    of the physics. The physics based approach can be subdivided broadly into experimental
    and numerical modeling. FIGURE 2. Physics based modeling: Based on first principles
    but can only model part of known physics due to assumptions at different stages.
    Show All 1) Experimental Modeling This approach consists of doing a lab or full
    scale experiment or surveys to understand a process or a phenomenon, developing
    correlations or models of quantities that can not be directly measured (or is
    expensive to measure) that can later be used in the the context of a digital twin.
    Hunt experiment [88] to collect health data, Bubble experiment [89] to collect
    urban boundary layer measurements, wind tunnel experiments to understand the physics
    of fluid flows are some of the examples that have been used to develop simplified
    parameterizations which are now widely used in the respective fields. Laboratory
    scale experiments are conducted on reduced scale of the problem under investigation.
    While it is possible to work with a reduced scale model, the scaling laws based
    on physics are almost always impossible to satisfy and hence limit their utility.
    Furthermore, both lab scale as well as field experiments can be extremely expensive,
    and they are therefore conducted for very coarse spatio-temporal resolutions.
    2) Three-Dimensional (3D) Modeling The first step towards numerical modeling is
    3D modeling. It is the process of developing a mathematical representation of
    any surface of an object. In most of the digital twins, 3D models are the starting
    point. The 3D models can either be constructed by a 3D scan of the object or through
    specialized software using equations and finally represented in terms of curves
    and surfaces. Almost all 3D models can be categorized into solid or shell models.
    In the context of digital twin, the 3D model goes as input to the physical simulators
    and hence its quality is of utmost importance. In this regard the representation
    of 3D finite element models using splines [90] (denoted isogeometric analysis)
    is interesting since it enables streamlining the whole workflow from 3D modeling
    to simulation and visualization of results, see [91]. During the last decade great
    progress towards adaptive refinement of isogeometric 3D models has been achieved.
    One popular method for local refinement is the Locally Refined B-splines (LR B-Splines),
    see [92] and [93]. In [94] and [95] LR B-Splines have been proposed for achieving
    more compact representation of the object geometry. In fact LR B-Splines approach
    appears to be very efficient in achieving high data compression ratios, which
    is very advantageous in a digital twin context. These new developments facilitate
    real-time geometry modifications (e.g., in simulating surgeries, deformation of
    structures) and associated simulations (e.g., fluid-structure simulations). 3)
    High Fidelity Numerical Simulators In order to add physical realism to any digital
    twin, the governing equations derived through physical modeling need to be solved.
    For simplified equations, sometimes analytical solutions are possible to derive
    but most of the time due to complexities, the equations need to be solved numerically
    on computers. Various discretization techniques over time have been developed
    for this. Some of the commonly used methods belong to one of the following categories:
    Finite Difference Method (FDM), Finite Element Method (FEM), Finite Volume Method
    (FVM) and Discrete Element Method (DEM). A detailed history of these methods can
    be found in [96]. They have been extensively used in many open-source and commercial
    multi-physics simulation packages (e.g., OpenFOAM, FEniCS, Elmer, ANSYS, Comsol,
    STAR-CCM+ etc). A great advantage of any physics based modeling approaches is
    that they are generally less biased than data-driven models since they are governed
    by the laws of nature. However, the choices of which governing equation (e.g.
    turbulence model in fluid flows) should be applied for a given physical system
    might be biased in the sense that different scientists/engineers have different
    preferences (e.g. due to different educational background), but this kind of bias
    is transparent as long as the governing equations are stated. Furthermore, physics
    based models are highly interpretable along with their generalizability to seemingly
    very different problems governed by the same physics. At the same time, however,
    these models can be prone to numerical instability, can be too computationally
    demanding, can have huge errors owing to uncertainty in modeling and inputs, and
    lack of robust mechanisms to assimilate long term historical data. Another problem
    associated with numerical modeling of man made objects is the incompatibility
    between the way 3D geometries are modeled in CAD-systems and the way the equations
    are solved in numerical simulators. It is estimated that 80% of the total time
    goes into cleaning the geometries and pre-processing, if not more, and only the
    remaining 20% for actual simulation and analysis. To alleviate this problem Hughes
    et al. [90] in 2005 came up with a novel method for analysis known as the Isogemetric
    Analysis. The approach offers the possibility of integrating finite element analysis
    with any conventional NURBS-based CAD design tools. Since 2005, there has been
    an explosion of publication in this field. The method has been utilized to solve
    a large array of problems ranging from fluid mechanics [97], [98], to solid mechanics
    to fluid-structure interaction [99], [100] as well as adaptive computational mechanics
    based on a posteriori error estimates [101] and [102]. Today advanced numerical
    simulators are e.g. used to improve surgical procedures and develop patient-specific
    models that enable predictive treatment of cardiovascular diseases. High-performing
    simulators capable of handling a billion degrees of freedom are opening new vistas
    in simulation-based science and engineering and combined with multiscale modeling
    techniques have improved significantly the predictive capabilities. Thus, the
    dream of establishing numerical laboratories (e.g. numerical wind tunnels) can
    now be realized for many interesting real world systems. Despite their immense
    success, the use of high-fidelity simulator has so far been limited to the design
    phase of man made engineering objects/systems. Unless their computational efficiency
    is improved by several orders of magnitude their full potential will remain under-utilized
    in a digital twin context. However, the great advances of the high-performance
    simulators during the last two decades qualify (many of) them to be denoted “high-fidelity”
    models that can serve to develop “Reduced Order Models” (ROM), see below, which
    may be used to establish predictive digital twins. B. Data-Driven Modeling While
    physics based models are the workhorse at the design phase, with the abundant
    supply of data in a digital twin context, opensource cutting edge and easy-to-use
    libraries (tensorflow, torch, openAI), cheap computational infrastructure (CPU,
    GPU and TPU) and high quality, readily available training resources, data-driven
    modeling is becoming very popular. Compared to the physics based modeling approach,
    as illustrated in Fig. 3, this approach is based on the assumption that since
    data is a manifestation of both known and unknown physics, by developing a data-driven
    model, one can account for the full physics. In this section we present the state-of-the-art
    starting from data generation and safety to advanced data driven modeling techniques.
    FIGURE 3. Data-driven modeling: Data is seen as a manifestation of both known
    and unknown physics. Show All 1) Data Generation One of the main reasons for the
    recent popularity of digital twins is the availability of cheap and miniaturized
    sensors which are capable of recording all possible kinds of imaginable data:
    text, audio, RGB images, hyperspectral images and videos. These miniaturized sensors
    can be installed on moving vehicles, drones, small satellites and underwater vehicles
    to quickly span all the four dimensions (three in space and one in time). Crowd
    sourcing of data because of the popularity of smart phones is also contributing
    massively towards data generation. It has been used to build up comprehensive
    databases of urban landcover World Urban Database and Access Portal Tools (WUDAPT
    [103]) database and local weather using NETATMO stations [104]. Online surveys
    and activities on social networking sites have created huge databases which are
    being used for training advanced ML models that are now being widely used for
    analyzing data. 2) Data Preprocessing, Management and Ownership With huge amount
    of data comes the problem of quality, management and ownership resolution of the
    data. For a correct working of digital twin there will be a need to improve the
    quality of data and compress them on the fly. Algorithms are required for automatic
    outlier detection and filling of missing data. At the moment very simplistic models
    like Principal Component and multidimensional interpolation techniques are utilized
    to fix these issues. However, more advanced methods like Restricted Boltzman Machine
    and Generative Adversarial Networks can be employed. Martens [105] has developed
    IDLE (Intensity observed = Displacement model of (Local intensity model) + Error)
    methods for on the fly learning from big data stream. As mentioned earlier LRB-S
    representations can be used for achieving massive compression ratios. The problem
    of ownership will be a tough nut to crack. The issue of data ownership can be
    complicated due to the involvement of different stakeholders who participated
    in the generation, processing, value addition or analysis of data. This can jeopardize
    the smooth working of any digital twin concept. 3) Data Privacy and Ethical Issues
    For successful implementation of digital twins, trust in information system is
    extremely critical especially when stringent privacy laws are getting shaped,
    digital twin will be used more and more in safety critical applications. In this
    context, Nakamoto [106] presented two game changing concepts. The first one is
    bitcoins and the other is blockchain. Blockchain is a distributed, secured and
    verifiable record of information (e.g., data, transactions) linked together in
    a single chain. The information is stored inside cryprographic blocks connected
    in a sequential order in a chain. The validity of each new block is verified by
    a peer-to-peer network before it is linked to the blockchain using a crytographic
    hash generated from the contents of the previous block. This ensures that the
    chain is never broken and each block is permanently recorded. This provides maximum
    security, traceability and transparency in applications where blockchains can
    be employed. In the context of digital twin where traceability and security of
    information is of utmost importance, blockchain is foreseen to play an important
    role.It will ensure secured archival and retrieval of data facilitated through
    advanced cryptography. It will be practically impossible to loose data since due
    to its inherent decentralized nature the data is always retrievalable. It will
    remove the risk of malicious attacks. All of this will come with greater transparency
    and hence greater accountability. The businesses will also be able to put pre-set
    condition on the blockchain to control automation. Mandolla et al. [107] gives
    a nice insight into the exploitation of blockchain technology in building a digital
    twin for additive manufacturing with focus on aircraft industry, and Li et al.
    [108] introduces an extended socio-technical framework for the implementation
    of blockchain into the construction industry. The authors in [109] propose a blockchain
    based searchable encryption for electronic health record sharing. Reyna et al.
    [110] gives a detailed overview of integration of the blockchain technology with
    IoT, its challenges (related to scalability, privacy, security and a total dearth
    of censorship) and latest research work to alleviate the associated shortcomings.
    4) Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Smart data analysis using ML and
    AI is expected to play a major role in the context of digital twin. ML is the
    scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use
    in order to perform tasks effectively without being explicitly programmed to do
    so and instead relies on learning from data alone. Although the term was coined
    in 1959 by Arthur Samuel, an American pioneer in the field of computer gaming
    and artificial intelligence, its real potential is being realized only recently
    when computers have begun to outperform humans in even creative tasks like art
    generation, script writing, text summarization, language translation and language
    interpretation and cross modal retreival [111]. Any ML can be broadly categorized
    into supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning
    is aimed at learning a mapping from independent variables to dependent variables.
    The mapping tasks can be either regression or classification. Most of the commonly
    used supervised algorithms are Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Support
    Vector Machine, Decision Trees, Random Forest and Artificial Neural Networks.
    The recent success of ML in outperforming humans in image classification [112],
    [113], [114]) and games like GO is attributed to Deep Learning (DL) [115] or Deep
    Neural Network (DNN). Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) [116] can be seen as
    stochastic neural networks that learn the input probability distribution in supervised
    as well as unsupervised manner and hence can be a powerful tools in detecting
    anomalies. In the context of digital twin, temporal RBM can be used to model multivariate
    timeseries, convolutional RBM is used to understand structure in timeseries, mean
    co-variance RBM to understand the covariance structure of the data and for dimensionality
    reduction [117]. Shallow Autoencoders which are neural networks whose input and
    output layers are exactly the same and sandwich a layer with comparatively much
    reduced number of nodes have been in use for efficient linear data compression
    (similar to Principal Component Analysis (PCA)). However, just by stacking many
    more layers result in Deep Autoencoder. These have been used for very diverse
    applications like diabetes detection [118], action detection for surveillance
    [119], feature learning for process pattern recognition [120], denoising for speech
    enhancement [121] [122], fault diagnosis [123], social image understanding [124],
    low light image enhancement [125]. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is another
    DL method which although has achieved unprecedented success mainly in image classification
    (ImageNet, AlexNet, VGG, YOLO, ResNet, DenseNet etc.) exceeding human level accuracy,
    have also been extensively used in textual analysis. More recently Generative
    Adversarial Networks (GANs) [126] where two networks called generators and discriminators
    are trained to outperform each other resulting in generators which can create
    data which are indistinguishable from real ones has achieved huge success. The
    method has huge potential in improving the data quality like upscaling image resolution
    [127], denoising [128], filling missing data [129] all of which are relevant in
    the context of digital twins. As a powerful Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long
    Short Term Memory (LSTM) network has demonstrated phenomenal success in modeling
    data involving time. Karim et al. [130] demonstrated the use of LSTM in timeseries
    classification. In [131] LSTM was used to forecast petroleum production. By combining
    CNN and LSTM, Kim et al. in [132] demonstrated its value in making predictions
    of the energy consumption in residential areas. The predictive capability of LSTM
    in particular will be instrumental in creating future scenarios in the context
    of digital siblings when direct observation data will be unavailable. The supervised
    algorithm in a digital twin context will be used for making predictions / projections
    or for conducting sensitivity / what-if analysis. One of the shortfalls of supervised
    algorithms is the need of dependent variables (labeled data) which might not always
    be available as in the case of anomaly. Unbalanced or skewed data rarely results
    in reliable prediction models. Anomaly detection which is extremely important
    for online health monitoring of any system, the labeled data is rarely available
    in abundance to train a supervised algorithms. In such a situation unsupervised
    algorithms like self organized maps (SOM) [133] and clustering analysis [134]
    (k-mean, t-SNE [135]) have better utility. Another important application of unsupervised
    algorithms like PCA and Deep Autoencoder can be for on-the-fly data compression
    for real-time processing, communication and control of the system under operation.
    While supervised and unsupervised learning ML algorithms have been the most commonly
    employed algorithms in real applications, they are not of much use in the absence
    of enough data. Reinforcement Learning [136], though in its infancy has the potential
    to aid in such a data-deprived situation. Reinforcement learning is an area of
    ML in which instead of learning directly from the data, an agent figures out an
    optimal policy to maximize its long term cumulative gain. It can be a key enabler
    for smart decision making systems in the technologies related to the Industry
    4.0 (see also [137] for a nice discussion of the anatomy of a decision). For example,
    in [138], the authors illustrated how a reinforcement learning framework might
    support operation and maintenance of power grid applications. The algorithms [139]
    without any prior knowledge and starting to play random gains, in 24 hours, achieved
    super-human level performance in chess, shogi as well as Go and convincingly defeated
    a work-champion program in each case. Since then the algorithm has been applied
    to solve more engineering problems like advanced planning of autonomous vehicles
    [140], lung cancer detection in medical treatment [141], smart agriculture [142],
    UAV cluster task scheduling [143], chatbots [144], autonomous building energy
    assessment [145]. Some advantages of the data-driven models is that they keep
    on improving as more and more data (experiences) are fed into them. The training
    part of the data-driven modeling might experience issues associated with instabilities.
    However, once trained the models are stable for making predictions. At the same
    time the data-driven models have some downsides too. Most complicated models of
    this class specially the ones based on DNN are uninterpretable. In safety critical
    applications like automatic drug injection in humans, guidance and navigation
    of autonomous vehicles or oil well drilling, a black-box approach will be unacceptable.
    In fact the vulnerability of DNN have been been exposed beyond doubt in several
    recent works [146], [147], [148]. These models can also be extremely biased depending
    upon the data they were trained on. C. Big Data Cybernetics: The Art of Steering
    Norbert Wiener defined cybernetics in 1948 as “the scientific study of control
    and communication in the animal and the machine,” which can be easily linked to
    digital twins. The objective of cybernetics is to steer a system towards a reference
    point. To achieve this, the output of the system is continuously monitored and
    compared against a reference point. The difference, called the error signal is
    then applied as feedback to the controller which in turn generates a system input
    that can direct the system towards the reference point. At times the quantity
    of interest that is required to compare against the reference can not be measured
    directly and hence has to be inferred from other quantities that are easier and
    cheaper to measure. With an increase in computational power and availability of
    big data, there are two major improvement possible within the cybernetics framework.
    Firstly, the controllers can be improved by increasing its complexity to incorporate
    more physics. Secondly, the big data can be utilized for a better estimation of
    the quantity of interest. In order to address these two issues a new field of
    big data cybernetics [149] shown in Fig. 4 is proposed. It is an adaptation of
    the concept first conceived in [150] at the Norwegian Univeristy of Science and
    Technology. In the figure, the first step is partial interpretation of big data
    using well understood physics-based models. The uninterpretable observation at
    this stage is termed interpretable residual and in a second step is modeled using
    an explainable data-driven approach. After the second step, again an uninterpretable
    residual remains which is modeled using more complex and black-box models preferably
    with some inbuilt sanity check mechanism. The remaining residual is generally
    noise which can be discarded. The three steps result in a better understanding
    of the data and hence improved models, provided, new approach can be developed
    to combine physics based modeling and data-driven modeling with big data. The
    steps are continuously looped with the availability of new streams of data (i.e.,
    see Fig. 4). The new approach should be intended towards removing the shortfalls
    of pure physics-based or pure data driven modeling approach (see Table 2 for a
    summary). We call this new approach Hybrid Analysis and Modeling (HAM) and define
    it as a modeling approach that combines the interpretability, robust foundation
    and understanding of a physics based modeling approach with the accuracy, efficiency,
    and automatic pattern-identification capabilities of advanced data-driven ML and
    AI algorithms. It is possible to place HAM approaches at the intersections of
    big data, physics based modeling and data driven modeling as shown in Fig. 5.
    TABLE 2 Physics Based Modeling vs Data-Driven Modeling FIGURE 4. Big Data Cybernetics:
    The model starts as a physics based model that is based on first principles but
    as time progresses the model is continuously updated using knowledge generated
    from data. Show All FIGURE 5. Hybrid analysis and modeling: Hybridization happens
    at the intersection of the three cricles. Show All 1) Data Assimilation Data assimilation
    (represented by the intersection of big data and physics-based high fidelity simulations
    in Fig. 5) is a well-established mathematical discipline that combines computational
    models with observations. It is a geoscience terminology and refers to the estimation
    of the state of a physical system given a model and measurements. In other words,
    it is the process of fitting models to data. In engineering fields the terms filtering,
    estimation, smoothing, prediction are often used [151]–[154]. Filtering and smoothing
    are very closely related concepts and differ by causality of the estimation problem.
    However, both terms refer to inference based on some data, and often used interchangeably.
    The term smoothing is generally used to correct predictive model before the current
    time by incorporating observations from its past and future. However, the term
    filtering is used to incorporate available observations to update the model at
    the current time. In practice, many techniques in data assimilation can be derived
    both from a deterministic and stochastic point of view. There are many presentations
    of the topic in books, review and tutorial articles (e.g., we refer to [155]–[165]
    for detailed mathematical descriptions). Although data assimilation approaches
    initially gained popularity in numerical weather forecasting [166]–[173], they
    are now routinely used in fields as diverse as finance, medical physics, signal
    processing, computer vision, robotics and navigation [174]–[191], and these techniques
    offer a great promise in many digital twin applications. In an operational atmospheric
    forecast, data assimilation deals with very large-scale state space systems and
    typically enables initialization of models by statistically combining information
    from short-range model forecasts and observations, based on the estimated uncertainty
    of each [192]. Data assimilation methods differ primarily in their treatment of
    the model background error and the methods for solving the analysis equations
    [193]. Both variational (adjoint methods) and sequential methods (Kalman filters)
    have been successfully used in operational weather centers to minimize the error
    between forecasting trajectory and noisy observation data. Dedicated comparisons
    of four-dimensional variational data assimilation (4D-VAR) and ensemble Kalman
    filter (EnKF) approaches can be found in [194]–[196]. Their variants as well as
    hybridized approaches have been also introduced in atmospheric science and numerical
    weather predictions [197], [198]. We refer to recent studies on the use of the
    Kalman filter [199] and particle filter [200] in the digital twin applications.
    2) Reduced Order Modeling There are a great number of high-dimensional problems
    in the field of science (like atmospheric flows) that can be efficiently modeled
    based on embedded low-dimensional structures or reduced order models (ROMs). This
    family of model can be best described at the intersection of physics-based high
    fidelity simulations and data-drive models as shown in the Fig. 5. These ROMs
    often trade a level of accuracy for much greater computational speed. This ROM
    concept (also called surrogate modeling or metamodeling) allows one to emulate
    complex full-order models or processes, and lies at the interface of data and
    domain specific sciences. It has been systematically explored for decades in many
    different areas including computational mechanics [201]–[204], combustion [205]–[207],
    cosmology [208]–[210], electrodynamics [211]–[214], meteorology [215]–[218], fluid
    mechanics [219]–[225], heat transfer [226]–[228] and various other multiphysics
    processes [229]–[235], as well as systems and control theories [236]–[241] in
    order to provide computational feasible surrogate models. Although the concept
    can be traced back to the works done by Fourier (1768-1830), there exist many
    recent monographs [242]–[249] and review articles [250]–[263]. In practice, ROMs
    (i.e., emulators) have great promise for applications especially when multiple
    forward full-order numerical simulations are required (e.g., data assimilation
    [264]–[269], parameter identification [270]–[273], uncertainty quantification
    [274]–[280], optimization and control [281]–[288]). These models can quickly capture
    the essential features of the phenomena taking place, and we often might not need
    to calculate all full order modeling details to meet real-time constraints. Another
    advantage can be realized for developing surrogate models stationary parameterized
    systems, where full order models typically require many pseudo-iterations to converge
    to a steady-state at each control parameter [289]–[291]. Therefore, reduced order
    modeling has been considered as a key enabler to compress high fidelity models
    into much lower dimensions to alleviate heavy computational demand in digital
    twin technologies [292]. ROM enables reusing simulation models from the early
    phases of product development in later product lifetime phases, especially during
    the product operation phase [293]. Most of the conventional ROMs require the exact
    form of the underlying partial differential equations (PDEs) involved to explain
    the physics phenomena (hence called intrusive). This is sometimes impractical
    due to Intellectual Property Rights or issues related to an incomplete understanding
    of the underlying processes. Alternatively, nonintrusive data-driven models (lying
    at the intersection of big data and data-driven models in Fig. 5) have emerged
    recently with the democratization of computational power, explosion of archival
    data, and advances in ML algorithms [294]–[304]. These approaches mostly involve
    matrix operations, which can be very efficiently parallelized on affordable GPU
    and TPU giving several orders of magnitude speedup as required in real-time applications.
    One of the main advantages of a nonintrusive approach is its portability, which
    results from the fact that it does not necessarily require the exact form of the
    equations and the operators or methods used to solve them. This makes the approach
    applicable to experimental data where the equations are often not well established
    or have huge uncertainties involved in their parameters. Together with their modularity
    and simplicity, nonintrusive models offer a unique advantage in multidisciplinary
    collaborative environments. It is often necessary to share the data or the model
    without revealing the proprietary or sensitive information. Different departments
    or subcontractors can easily exchange data (with standardized I/O) or executables,
    securing their intangible assets and intellectual property rights. Furthermore,
    nonintrusive approaches are particularly useful when the detailed governing equations
    of the problem are unknown. This modeling approach can benefit from the enormous
    amount of data collected from experiments, sensor measurements, and large-scale
    simulations to build a robust and accurate ROM technology. Once ROMs are constructed
    its operational execution cost is usually negligible in PDE constrained optimization
    problems. Besides, another advantage can be viewed in such a way that the optimization
    task may be separated from the generation of data for a ROM via a design of experiments
    (DOE) approach or other interpolation approaches [305], [306]. The statistical
    approach proposed by Krige [307] has become highly popular in such multidimensional
    interpolation problems (known as Kriging or Gaussian Process Regression [308]).
    Of course, we have to take into account the cost of creating an initial database
    requiring large-scale high-fidelity simulations within complex domains discretized
    by finite volumes or finite elements. The authors, in their recent studies [309]–[311],
    make ROM inter-operatable between different discretization techniques. In addition,
    the use of radial basis functions (RBF) in finite elements can be found in [312]
    for nonlinear structural analysis. A description of radial basis approximation
    in PDE systems can be found in [313]. A hybrid reduced basis and finite element
    method has been proposed as a component-to-system model order reduction approach,
    which is considered as one of the key enablers in digital twin technologies [314].
    An application of RBF to construct a noninstrusive ROM for data assimilation applications
    can be found in [315]. 3) Hardware and Software in the Loop Hardware-in-the-loop
    (HIL) simulation approach, a well-established concept of using a physical object
    during system development phase in control engineering [316]–[318], can be also
    considered as a promising approach towards near real-time predictions within digital
    twin platforms (e.g., see also software-in-the-loop (SIL) simulation studies for
    early design processes [319]–[321]). For example, a real-time co-simulation concept
    for HIL simulations has been presented in [322] considering the virtual commissioning
    of production systems. 4) Other Hybridization Techniques As the constructive criticism
    of Albert Einstein and many others had helped to develop a better understanding
    of quantum mechanics [323]–[325], we believe the valuable criticisms coming from
    domain scientists might help to develop more interpretable ML methodologies for
    scientific applications. For example, we refer to recent surveys of ML in domain-specific
    areas of molecular and material science [326] and fluid mechanics [327]. Complete
    replacement of equations with ML algorithms for gaining computational efficiency
    when generalization is not a necessity (e.g., we refer to [328]–[335] and references
    cited therein for speeding up numerical solvers for real-time applications), and
    can be used in the context of digital twin when the same process is to be monitored
    time and again. However, this approach will fail in unexpected situation because
    the model only learns to interpolate and not extrapolate. A better approach on
    the integration of ML to physical processes has been demonstrated intuitively
    in [336] where the known physics is modeled using the established governing equations
    while the unknown physics is modeled using black-box DNN or LSTM networks. When
    combined, the black-box part improves the overall accuracy of the combined model
    and the equation based part puts an inbuilt sanity check mechanism to detect unexpected
    behavior of the black-box part. In their perspective [337], the authors, considering
    an Earth system model, charted a comprehensive integration scheme that can be
    done through (i) improving parameterization, (ii) replacing physical submodel
    with machine learning, (iii) analysis of model-observation mismatch, (iv) constraining
    submodels, and (v) developing surrogates. It has been concluded that a joint modeling
    approach offers viable solutions to tackle challenges such as interpretability,
    physical consistency, noise, limited data, and computational demand, when these
    theory-driven physical process models combined with the versatility of data-driven
    ML. Another approach to improving the interpretability of any ML algorithm is
    to reduce the complexity of the algorithm. One way of doing this is to engineer
    new features based on domain knowledge and informing the ML about it. Since, the
    algorithm is relieved of the additional task of rediscovering these features,
    one can work with simpler algorithms with far better accuracy. This approach was
    demonstrated in the context of material discovery in [338], [339]. More work on
    hybrid analytics or hybrid physics-AI modeling can be found in [340]–[344]. For
    example, we refer to the works done in [345], [346] using such hybrid approaches
    combining deterministic and ML components in general circulation models (GCMs)
    for applications to climate modeling and weather predictions. The processes in
    GCMs can be split into two parts referring to model dynamics (i.e., set of 3D
    equations of motion governed by PDEs for mass, momentum, energy etc) and model
    physics (i.e., source terms for parameterizing atmospheric radiation, turbulence,
    precipitation, clouds, chemistry, etc). The hybrid approach has a good motivation
    for emulating model physics, since this part often dominates the total model computation
    time. Similar gray-box approaches have been gaining popularity in various other
    fields too (e.g., hydrology [347], material forming [348], bioprocess [349], built
    environment [350], petroleum [351], reactor design [352] and quantum chemistry
    [353]). Another interesting way of combining physics based modeling and big data
    is the approach advocated by Soize and Farhat [354] and [355]. They exploit available
    data to adapt the subspace in which the solution of the problem formulated using
    the computational model is searched. The method is innovative as it discover some
    form of the information or knowledge encapsulated in data, instead of the common
    approach to adapt model parameters. The resulting nonparametric probalistic reduced
    order method enables a sound mathematical/statistical based combination of physics
    based model and data highly relevant in a digital twin context. 5) Physics-Informed
    ML When it comes to utilizing ML algorithms in cases where the underlying physical
    process of high dimension, some of the challenges include incorporating physical
    laws within the learning framework, producing solutions that are interpretable,
    addressing nonlinearities, conservation properties, and dealing with the massive
    amount of data needed for training. For example, in mathematical models governed
    by PDEs, the authors in [356] demonstrated a different approach of programming
    physics directly into the DL algorithm. They did so by using the residual of the
    governing equations to regularize the cost function that can be optimized in any
    ML algorithm. In [357], the PDEs are reformulated as backward stochastic differential
    equations and the gradient of unknown solution is approximated using neural networks.
    This is inspired from the deep reinforcement learning with gradient acting as
    the policy function. Physics-informed ML ideas have also been utilized in various
    areas including inorganic scintillator discovery [358], fluid dynamics [359]–[361],
    projection-based model reduction [362], cardiovascular system modeling [363],
    and wind farm applications [364]. In [365], the authors have presented a comprehensive
    review on the taxonomy of explicit integration of knowledge into ML. As generously
    highlighted by Martens in his perspective paper [105], most domain-specific software
    tools can be improved by fresh impulses from the developments in computer and
    cognitive sciences, and in return, many specific disciplines have a lot to give
    to these sciences as well as to other fields. Therefore, the concept of Physics/Knowledge/Science-informed
    ML might offer a powerful transformation to combine practice and theory (e.g.,
    please see [366]–[370] for promoting theory-guided ML in various disciplines).
    For example, a symmetry enforcing approach to learn salient features from a sparse
    data set has been introduced using a knowledge injection concept [371], that might
    be a key enabler in developing digital twin technologies. 6) Compressed Sensing
    and Symbolic Regression Compressed sensing (CS) has been applied to signal processing
    in seeking the sparsest solution [372]–[374]. Sparsity-promoting optimization
    techniques (e.g., least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and
    its generalizations) often perform feature selection through L1 penalty added
    to recover sparse solutions [375]–[377]. Ridge regression is another regularized
    variant where L2 penalty is added to objective function [378]–[380]. Elastic nets
    combine the strengths of the LASSO and ridge approaches [381]–[383]. Sequentially
    thresholded ridge regression (STRidge) can be also used in more complex systems
    with correlated basis functions [384]. In recent years, the use of ML methods
    has complemented the need for formulating mathematical models, and allowed accurate
    estimation of observed dynamics by learning automatically from the given observations
    and building models. For example, sparse regression has been applied for recovering
    several nonlinear canonical PDEs [384]. These sparse optimization techniques have
    been used to recover the underlying basis from many candidate featuring terms.
    The computational time of these approaches are small and in general they can handle
    large datasets. One of the key concern with these techniques are that they perform
    poorly on data corrupted with noise. In addition, evolutionary approaches are
    proposed at another end of spectrum to leverage randomness as virtue in recovering
    models. Symbolic regression (SR) methods explore a function space, which is generally
    bounded by a preselected set of mathematical operators and operands, using a population
    of randomly generated candidate solutions. A seminal work by Schmidt and Lipson
    [385] has demonstrated that the SR approach can be used to determine the underlying
    structure of a nonlinear dynamical system from data. This approach is crucial
    where data is abundant (e.g., geophysical flows, finance, neuroscience) but the
    accurate physical law/model is not available. When it comes to large-scale datasets,
    gene expression programming (GEP), for example, has been applied to recover turbulence
    closures [386]. The authors tailored original GEP algorithm [387] to handle tensor
    regression and recover complex functional forms. Recently, a mixed approach was
    proposed by Both et al. [388] where the feed forward neural networks and sparse
    regression techniques were combined to handle noisy data. These tools can be exploited
    as a potential data-driven tool for recovering hidden physical structures or parameterizations
    representing high-dimensional systems from data in digital twin applications.
    D. Infrastructure and Platforms 1) Big Data Technologies The infrastructure for
    storing and processing high volume data has been advanced considerably over the
    last decades. Many available platforms are available to handle big data projects
    in terms of blending, integration, storage, centralized management, interactive
    analysis, visualization, accessibility and security. Many IT vendors benefit from
    Hadoop technology [389]–[392], which allows us to execute tasks directly from
    its hosting place without copying to local memory. Indeed, there are many survey
    articles to discuss various aspects of big data including not only state-of-the-art
    technology and platforms, but also algorithms, applications and challenges [393]–[407].
    More recently, Kaufmann [408] introduced a big data management concept to address
    the critical needs of digital twin applications. 2) IoT Technologies The IoT is
    becoming increasingly popular to develop smart technologies in several sectors
    ranging from healthcare to agriculture, from transportation to energy. The availability
    of high-speed Wi-Fi internet connection, digital machines, low-cost sensors along
    with the development of ML algorithms to perform real-time analysis has contributed
    to enabling IoT [409], [410]. The leading IoT vendors provide reliable and innovative
    platforms to set up IoT devices for various applications [411]. Amazon Web Services
    (AWS) offers various IoT solutions [412]. For example, AWS IoT finds its application
    in biomedical research to identify biological insights which were not known before
    [413]. The high volume of complex biomedical data is being generated using the
    state-of-the-art high-throughput machines and this data can be processed and stored
    efficiently using cloud computing. In their work [413], the cloud computing framework
    was applied to genome mapping which uses a large amount of next-generation sequencing
    (NGS) data. This task can be easily distributed over a computer cluster and cloud
    computing is an ideal platform for this, as it does not have limitations of high-performance
    computing (HPC) systems such as job queues and unsupported software. Another application
    of IoT is in sensor network technologies which are used extensively in environmental
    monitoring and industrial automation. Cloud computing often provides a flexible
    computational model that is perfectly suitable for unpredictable demands generated
    by environmental sensor networks. For example, in [414], Amazon’s elastic compute
    cloud (EC2) was applied for processing dynamic data collected by sensor networks
    in environmental applications. IoT has also been used in developing smart home
    technologies in which the operating conditions such as humidity, temperature,
    luminosity, etc are controlled with minimum user’s intervention. In [415], IoT
    concepts and cloud computing were integrated to facilitate smart home implementations.
    Their architecture uses microcontroller-enabled sensors to monitor home conditions,
    actuators for performing required actions, and Google App Engine platform for
    creating and setting up their web application. In [416], the authors used Twitter
    application to collect data, and presented Google App Engine as a possible solution
    for mining and analyzing the large amount of data. Microsoft launched Azure IoT
    Suite, a platform that enables end-users to communicate with their IoT services
    and devices, exchange data, and process it in a convenient way [417]. Many other
    specified platforms have been built on top of Azure for different applications.
    Forsström and Jennehag [418] investigated a system built by combining Azure IoT
    hub and the open plant communication universal architecture (OPCUA) for a realistic
    industrial situation tracking an industrial component with 1500 sensors. For agricultural
    purposes, Vasisht et al. [419] presented FarmBeats, an end-to-end IoT platform
    for data-driven agriculture which uses Microsoft Azure IoT Suite for cloud services
    and passing data summaries to storage. FarmBeats is capable of handling data from
    various sensor types with different bandwidths. Also, it is sufficiently reliable
    even in cases of power and internet outages from bad weather. For healthcare applications,
    Manashty et al. [420] proposed a healthcare event aggregation lab (HEAL) model
    in order to detect health anomalies as accurately and fast as possible. A prototype
    of HEAL was implemented and tested on Azure. Das et al. [421] proposed a cloud
    based approach to make users aware of probable health risks of the flickering
    of surrounding artificial light. A small-length video is recorded using phone’s
    camera. It is then uploaded to Azure cloud storage, where it can be further processed
    and analyzed to give informed instructions. SAP cloud platform helps to implement
    IoT applications. Koduru et al. [422] proposed a framework based on SAP cloud
    for implementing a smart irrigation system taking water supply from borewells
    and weather conditions into account. Tsokov and Petrova-Antonova [423] proposed
    EcoLogic, a solution for real-time monitoring of running vehicles and their respective
    emissions’ levels, in order to keep the carbon emissions within acceptable limits
    through smart notifications and management of vehicle’s power. The system combines
    hardware module that collects data related to vehicles’ emissions with cloud-based
    applications for data processing, and analysis using SAP cloud platform. Salesforce
    IoT which is based on software delivery paradigm where users access the software
    through personal web browsers and vendors host the business software. This software
    delivery paradigm is categorized under software-as-a-service (SaaS) built on cloud
    computing [424]. This paradigm helps in scalability, efficient maintenance, efficient
    management and lower resource costs. Salesforce IoT platform is designed to take
    in the massive amount of data generated by devices, sensors, websites and applications
    and initiate actions for real-time responses. Some real-time applications might
    include wind turbines that automatically adjusts its parameters based on live
    weather data, passengers whose connecting flights are delayed could be rebooked
    before they have landed [425]–[427]. Salesforce customer relationship management
    (CRM) software package was used by organizations to anticipate customer needs
    based on their past requirements and choices [428]. Such platforms have been also
    deployed in governmental organizations [429]. Oracle IoT is a cloud-based service
    for business implementations and uses software delivery paradigm called platform-as-a-service
    (PaaS) [430], [431]. Among many applications, Oracle IoT has been used for analyzing
    data regarding user’s venue recommendations such as user’s current geographical
    location, weather and traffic conditions, cost, service or distance of the venues,
    as well as social network user reviews of venues [432]. Cisco is one of the early
    business groups to realize the birth and potential of IoT based platforms [433]–[435].
    Okafor et al. [436] used Cisco Nexus platform to develop a scalable IoT datacenter
    management (cost-effective processing, storing, and analysis of large volumes
    of data) for fog computing. In [437], the authors summarize the opportunities
    and challenges of fog computing in the networking context of IoT. A fog assisted
    IoT system has been considered as a health monitoring system in smart homes [438].
    In their recent work, Bakhshi et al. [439] discussed industrial security threats
    and concerns for both Cisco and Microsoft Azure IoT architectural models (for
    data accumulation and abstraction layers of those model architectures) and then
    suggested some security considerations. In fact, the security and privacy concerns
    are the major challenges of implementing any IoT devices [440]. Bosch IoT suite
    provides not only services through cloud connections but also the on-premise services
    with no third party access to the local data [441], [442]. In [443], the authors
    introduced an architectural model to successfully establish such IoT ecosystem
    through platform interoperability. An example of integrating IoT devices provided
    by Bosch IoT suite into a business process has been discussed in details in [444].
    Using the IBM BlueMix cloud computing platform, an IoT technology has been applied
    to build a smart car system that monitors and the car’s activity and informs the
    owner or technician about the routine maintenance to ensure safe and efficient
    driving [445]. In [446], real-time air quality parameters such as humidity, temperature,
    and particulate matter were measured using different sensors. Data storage, data
    management, and data analysis were performed using the IBM Bluemix cloud to inform
    about the necessary decisions promptly. 3) Communication Technologies A reliable
    working of any digital twin will require information arising from different components
    to reach its intended target on time. For example, during a robotic surgery, the
    action of a surgeon in a digital operation theater should manifest into action
    in reality without any latency. With so many sensors comes the problem of fast
    data communication. The state-of-the-art communication technology like 4G will
    run into problems as more and more devices will start sharing the limited radio-frequency
    spectrum. 5G technology with a wider frequency range might accommodate many more
    devices but that requires communication at much higher frequencies (30–300GHz)
    compared to the currently used frequencies by our mobile network. Such high frequencies
    waves called Millimeter Waves [447] can not penetrate obstacles readily and hence
    more and more miniaturized base stations called Small Cells operating on low power
    will be placed spanning the whole relevant area. These base stations can also
    support hundreds of ports for many more antennas. The technology is called Massive
    MIMO. The large number of antennas mean more signal interference which will be
    corrected using the Beamforming technology [447] which is a traffic-signaling
    system for the cellular base station which optimizes the data-delivery route to
    a particular user. Finally, for multiple communication at the frequency full duplexing
    is being looked into. The 5G technology will form the backbone of any digital
    twin owing to their ultralow latency and unprecedented speed and is already being
    used in the world’s first 5G cinema in Oslo. Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN)
    technology has been gaining a great attention for IoT applications, while keeping
    network structures and management simple [448]–[450]. Unmanned Aerial Systems
    (UAS) cooperations have also recently attracted considerable attention to assist
    ground base stations in the case of crowded public events, natural disasters,
    or other temporal emergencies that require additional needs for network resources
    [451]–[453]. For example, UAS based sensing systems have demonstrated value for
    flexible in-situ atmospheric boundary layer observations to improve weather forecasting
    [454]–[456]. 4) Computational Infrastructures According to Moore’s Law, the performance
    and functionality of computers/processors can be expected to double every two
    years due to the advances in digital electronics. Therefore, in scientific computing
    applications, the speeds of both computation and communication have substantially
    increased over the years. However, the communication becomes more challenging
    as the number of processing elements increases and/or the number of grid points
    decreases within a processing elements, which constitutes a major bottleneck at
    upcoming exascale computing systems [457]–[459]. Unless we face up to a new transistor
    technology (e.g., see [460]) to replace current metal-oxide semiconductor transistor
    technologies, this doubling trend saturates as chip manufacturing sector reaches
    the limits of the atomic scale. This leads to more effective use of transistors
    through more efficient architectures (e.g., see [461] for a recent discussion
    in extreme heterogeneity). The HPC community has started to move forward to incorporate
    GPU based accelerators and beyond (e.g., TPUs [462]) for not only graphics rendering
    but also scientific computing applications. This heterogeneity shift becomes even
    more crucial in future since there is a rapid increase in the usage of high-productivity
    programming languages (e.g., Matlab, R, Python, Julia) among engineers and scientists.
    In a recent article [463], the authors reviewed synergistic activities among major
    software development organizations considering challenges such as productivity,
    quality, reproducibility, and sustainability. As an enabling technology for digital
    twins, cloud computing utilizes computing power at remote servers hosted on the
    Internet to store, manage, and process information/data, rather than a local server
    or a personal computer [464]–[466]. Edge computing utilizes computing power at
    the edge/nodes of the networks, to completely or partly to store, manage, and
    process information/data locally [467]–[470]. Fog computing is a blend of cloud
    and edge computing where it is unknown to the user where in the network the data
    is stored, managed and processed, and the load is distributed automatically between
    remote servers and local resources [471], [471]. In [472], the authors developed
    a simulator to model IoT using fog environments and measured the impact of resource
    management techniques in latency, network congestion, energy consumption, and
    cost. We refer to [473] for the energy management and scalability of IoT systems
    using fog computing. In [474], the authors reviewed offloading in fog computing
    in IoT applications. The use of time sensitive networking (TSN) protocol service
    as a deterministic transport for the network layer of fog computing in industrial
    automation has been discussed in [475], especially considering their use in real-time
    control applications. Furthermore, granular computing paradigm [476] offers a
    general framework based on granular elements such as classes, clusters, and intervals
    and might be quite useful in big data applications [477]–[479]. It is also anticipated
    that emerging quantum computing systems will offer phenomenal capabilities for
    solving data-intensive complex problems (e.g., computational sciences, communication
    networks, artificial intelligence [480]). 5) Digital Twin Platforms Kongsberg
    Digital is a company delivering PaaS and SaaS services for energy, oil and gas,
    and maritime industries. Kongsberg is partner with some key cloud vendors, including
    Microsoft Azure, to provide enabling information technology services [481]. In
    2017, Kongsberg launched its open digital ecosystem platform, called KognifAI
    [482]. It combines a group of applications on the cloud focusing on optimal data
    accessibility and processing. KognifAI is built on cybersecurity, identity, encryption,
    and data integrity [483]. Moreover, its main infrastructure can be utilized to
    easily scale applications and services [484]. KognifAI offers digital twin solutions
    in maritime, drilling and wells, renewable energies, etc [485]. Kongsberg dynamic
    digital twin combines safety with fast prototyping and implementation, and connects
    offshore and onshore users in oil and gas industry [486]. It can provide a model
    not only to represent an existing physical system, but also a planned installation
    (e.g., greenfield digital twin [487]) or maintenance and repair (e.g, brownfield
    [488]). In 2018, MapleSim, a product of MapleSoft, added new features for developing
    digital twins [489]. MapleSim is powerful in creating an accurate dynamic model
    of the machine based on CAD data, with all forces and torques included. The major
    focus of MapleSim digital twin module is to implement virtual plant models that
    do not necessarily require expert knowledge. To test motor sizing in a new screwing
    machine at Stoppil Industrie, a digital twin of the machine was created using
    MapleSim [490]. The initial motor size was found to be undersized by a factor
    of 10, which would have caused machine failure and excessive losses. MapleSim
    was integrated into B&R automation studio to facilitate the use of digital twin
    for machine development [491]. MapleSim in conjunction with B&R software were
    used to build model-based feedback during motor sizing for an injection molding
    machine [492]. Cognite provides the full-scale digital transformation services
    to heavy industries such as oil and gas, power [493], original equipment manufacturers
    (OEMs), and shipping companies. Cognite has built a software package named Cognite
    Data Fusion that extracts useful information from the data. One of the main features
    of Cognite Data Fusion is its APIs, SDKs, and libraries that are open-source to
    its customers. Developers and analysts can build applications and ML models that
    best suit the operation needs. These applications can include large CAD models,
    complex asset plans, and can be run on phones and tablets. Cognite Data Fusion
    also offers to customize permissions hierarchies for sharing data with partners
    and suppliers. For example, the Cognite Digital Platform has helped Framo (an
    OEM for pumping systems) and their customer Aker BP to communicate and share the
    live operational data of equipment more efficiently [494]. This enabled Framo
    to create their applications and monitor the status of equipment to plan the maintenance.
    Using the operational data of their equipment, OEMs can inform their customers
    about how to improve the performance of the equipment. The integration of the
    Siemens information management system (IMS) and Cognite data platform has benefited
    Aker BP in optimizing the offshore maintenance and reduce costs [495]. With the
    availability of live data and using artificial intelligence, ML algorithms, Siemens
    presented a powerful analysis of each equipment with advanced visualizations.
    Siemens digital twin leads the industry by offering diverse computational tools
    in CAE, CAD, manufacturing and electronic design and connect information from
    all of these domains using a seamless digital thread to give companies tremendous
    insight into products and designs [496], [497]. Siemens plant simulation (PS)
    digital tool was successfully interfaced (digital copy) with production line involving
    manufacturing of pneumatic cylinders within automotive industry to promote the
    concept of Industry 4.0. The production line simulation model was optimized by
    genetic algorithm provided by Siemens PS tool which adjusted the simulation model
    and then simulated the digital twin [498]. Smart factories are designed with machines
    that can operate based on manufacturing environments, control production processes
    and share information with each other in the form of knowledge graphs. Generally,
    knowledge graphs are incomplete and missing data has to be inferred. Siemens digital
    twin powered by machine learning tools (e.g., recurrent neural networks) was demonstrated
    to complete the knowledge graph and synchronize the digital and the physical representations
    of a smart factory [499]. ANSYS introduced digital twin builder in its ANSYS 19.1
    version. ANSYS twin builder provides the developer with several features such
    as creating a multi-domain system, multiple fidelity and multiphysics solver,
    efficient ROM construction capabilities, third-party tool integration, embedded
    software integration, as well as system optimization [500]. ANSYS along with other
    companies built the digital twin for a pump that can use the real-time sensor
    data to improve its performance and to predict failures [501]. General Electric
    also used a customized version of ANSYS digital twin to design megawatt-sized
    electric circuit breakers [502]. Akselos, founded in 2012, offers instantaneous
    physics based simulations and analyses of critical infrastructures calibrated
    with sensor data in an asset-heavy industry. The key benefits of Akselos digital
    twin are the asset performance optimization and life extension, failure prediction
    and prevention, as well as contingency planning. Akselos owns a structural analysis
    tool that’s fast enough to integrate, re-calibrate, and re-analyze the sensor
    data. Their framework uses a reduced basis finite element analysis (RB-FEA) technology,
    a state-of-the-art reduced order modeling approach which is quite faster than
    conventional FEA and higher accuracy is ensured by using a posteriori accuracy
    indicators and automated model enrichment. Akselos provides a cloud based platform
    to develop the digital twin framework for any number of users from any geographic
    locations or organizations. The structural models developed by Akselos have the
    capacity to incorporate the localized nonlinearities as well. Among the existing
    case studies, Akselos digital twin is used for offshore asset life extension,
    optimizing floating production storage and offloading, inspection, return on investment,
    and ship loader life extension. Akselos unlocked 20 years of structural capacity
    for the assets operated by Royal Dutch Shell in the North Sea. Details about the
    Akselos and their work agenda can be found in [503] and [504]. General Electric
    (GE) has been developing a digital twin environment integrated with different
    components of the power plant that takes into account customer defined Key Performance
    Indicator (KPIs) and business objectives by measuring asset health, wear and performance.
    Their Digital Twin runs on the Predix platform, designed to operate large volumes
    of sensor data at an industrial scale. Their platform offers advanced distribution
    management solutions, geospatial network modeling solutions, grid analytics, and
    asset performance management for power and utility services such as next generation
    sensing technologies, digital threading, artificial intelligence, advanced control
    and edge computing. Many world renowned companies have been applied these technologies
    for diverse industrial fields like automotive, food and beverage, chemicals, digital
    energy, steel manufacturing, equipment manufacturing, pulp/paper manufacturing,
    and semiconductors. Details on GE digital can be found in [505] and [506]. Oracle
    IoT Cloud offer Digital Twin through three pillars, (i) virtual twin where the
    physical asset or device is represented virtually in the cloud, (ii) predictive
    twin using either physics based models (FEM/CFD) or statistic/ML models having
    support from Oracle’s products such as Oracle R Advanced Analytics for Hadoop
    (ORAAH) and Oracle Stream Explorer, and (iii) twin projections where the insights
    generated by digital twin is projected to the backend application and supported
    by Oracle ERP (supply chain, manufacturing, maintenance applications) and CX (service)
    [6]. E. Human-Machine Interface As the demarcation between humans and machine
    starts to fade in the context of Digital Twin, there will be a need for more effective
    and fast communication and interaction. While augmented/virtual reality, without
    doubt will be required to create a detailed visualization of the assets, natural
    language processing and gesture control will be a very common mode of interaction.
    We detailed the current state-of-the-art in human machine interface and their
    potential usage in a DT context. 1) Augmented and Virtual Reality Augmented Reality
    (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) can be considered among the key technologies that
    promise to add new perspectives in many sectors [507]. We refer to several review
    articles on the state-of-the-arts in engineeing and design [508]–[512], medicine
    [513]–[517] and education [518]–[521]. In [3], Escorsa highlighted numerous patented
    developments within the digital twin context in arrangements for interaction with
    the human body such as, for example, “haptics” touch feedback technologies as
    computer generated output to the user developed by Immersion Inc. 2) Natural Language
    Processing Voice has been perhaps the most effective and quickest mode of communication
    among humans. For a seamless integration of the humans and machine in the context
    of the digital twin, there is an obvious need for elevating this mode of communication
    to a level that humans and machines can interact seamlessly. With the recent advancements
    in DL [115] and LSTM algorithms [522], language translations and interpretation
    has reached at least human level accuracy and efficiency if not more. A nice discussion
    on the major recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) focusing on
    neural network-based methods can be found in [523]. The blog condenses 18 years
    (2001–2018) worth of work into eight milestones that are the most relevant today.
    Further insights about the recent trends in NLP can be found in [524]. 3) Gesture
    Control Recent advancement in remote sensing technologies allows highly accurate
    gesture recognition capabilities through RF and mmWave radar [525]–[528], ambient
    light [529]–[531], cameras and image processing [532]–[535], sound [536]–[539]
    and wearable devices [540]–[542]. Along with the faster communication in the IoT,
    such technological developments in gesture training and control will be crucial
    in developing more robust digital twin systems. SECTION VI. Socio-Economic Impacts
    Digital Twinning will bring about unprecedented automation in the management of
    any physical asset. One of the first concern that can be a stumbling block for
    the adaptation of digital twins just like any other automation technologies will
    be its acceptability by the work force. The fear of losing jobs seemed very logical
    a few decades earlier [543], however even at that time contrary opinions were
    prevalent based on systematic studies [544]. In fact, Sheridan showed that automation
    just results in redistribution of workplace without much impact on employment
    [545]. Such studies highlights the vulnerability of the workforce with lower qualification
    involved in repeatative jobs. There are also positive aspects with automation
    and that is with a careful task allocation between humans and machines, it can
    enable greater safety and creativity at work place by deallocating dirty, dumb
    and dangerous (3D) jobs to machines and artificial intelligence. Such task allocation
    has been extensively studied in [546]–[548]. Humans should be in the loop not
    only for coordinating AI developments but also checking AI results. At this point
    it is worth remembering the reflection “ironies of automation” by Lisanne Bainbridge.
    It simply states that the as automation takes over the simpler works, the role
    of humans to manage more complicated unpredictable tasks will become even more
    critical. How to groom humans to deal with unexpected events after prolonged phases
    of inactivity will be a major challenge. Moreover, for economic reasons, there
    will be a lesser motivation for recruiting professional users of the relevant
    technologies, a base of non-professional users might be a natural outcome. This
    will require strategies to handle security and hacking [549]. As the world gears
    towards greater autonomy resulting from digital twinning, efforts will have to
    be made to create opportunities for all and nor for a selected few. Nevertheless,
    with good guiding intentions, the technology will improve the quality of work
    at work places and with good training and career couselling will enable workers
    to focus on more creative work. SECTION VII. Conclusions and Recommendations Based
    on our literature survey we present the following definition of digital twin:
    A digital twin is defined as a virtual representation of a physical asset enabled
    through data and simulators for real-time prediction, optimization, monitoring,
    controlling, and improved decision making. We find the breakdown of digital twin
    into three pillars as proposed by Oracle [6] to be useful both in communicating
    the concept as well as identify the role we think the different stakeholders should
    take in order to fully exploit its potential: Virtual Twin: Creation of a virtual
    representation of a physical asset or a device in the cloud. Predictive Twin:
    Physics based, data driven or hybrid models operating on the virtual twin to predict
    the behaviour of the physical asset. Twin Projection: Integration of insights
    generated by the predictive twin into the business operation and processes. Despite
    the challenges, applying digital twin technologies to various sectors is gaining
    in popularity. Based on our technology watch, we would like to conclude our analysis
    providing recommendations for each stakeholders group (Fig. 6) and their most
    important contributions: Industry: The greatest pull for the technology is going
    to come from the industry sector. There are three most important ways in which
    this sector can make positive contributions (a) by making asset dataset available
    for research and validated model building (b) by actively participating in research
    through practical knowledge sharing (c) by being proactive in ‘projecting’ the
    insights obtained from predictive twins into their business applications to validate
    the usefulness of digital twins. Academia and research institutes: It is foreseen
    that along with close cooperation with the industry sectors most of the enabling
    technologies for both ‘virtual twins’ and ‘predictive twins’ will be developed
    by the academia and research institutes. We strongly recommend that these developments
    are made exploitable for the society at large by means of open source software.
    Along with providing the technological know-how, the academia will also have to
    take the lead in grooming an altogether new generation of workforce to serve the
    reformed environment. We advocate the MAC-model, i.e. to educate and train a new
    generation of researchers in forming interdisciplinary teams that combine application
    knowledge (A) with expertise and advanced methodologies from mathematics (M) and
    computer science (C). Government and policy makers: To ensure that the benefits
    of the new technology reach every layer of the society, that humans are still
    relevant and there is no compromise with ethics, privacy and security, new inclusive
    policies and regulations will have to be framed. There should be a major effort
    toward the democratization of the technology. Data protection and privacy laws
    (e.g., the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), agreed upon by the European
    Parliament and Council in April 2016) is definitely and encouraging step in the
    right direction. The different governmental bodies should initiate feasibility
    studies for utilizing digital twins within their sectors. In particular, investigate
    different scenarios on how they can profit from ‘projecting’ insights obtained
    from relevant predictive twins into their governmental responsibilities. Furthermore,
    data generated by means of public funding (e.g. weather forecast, anonymous health
    care data) should be openly available and made easily exploitable for the academia
    and the industry. Funding agencies: Especially those with a strong mission focusing
    on industrial innovation impact, the digital twinning offers a challenging theme
    for center projects (e.g., US NSF Engineering Research Centers and other international
    comparators [550]). As a platform for multidisciplinary research, digital twin
    concept consists of a wide spectrum from the fundamental research and enabling
    technology development to the system integration phase. However, funding of open
    source enabling technology platforms should be prioritized as the funding mechanisms
    of such infrastructure have been scarce up to now. Society: The onus to be well
    informed about the new technology is on the society itself. It is not a matter
    of if but when the new technology will bring about remarkable changes in our private
    and professional lives. Thus, we recommend that one start develop new skills during
    the K12 education which will facilitate embracement of the emerging technology.
    FIGURE 6. Stakeholders and their potential contributions. Show All While the definition
    of a digital twin is unambiguous, what is not a digital twin is a difficult question
    to answer. There is a need to quantify the degree to which a digital twin resembles
    its physical counterpart both in terms of appearance and behaviour. As we have
    discussed in this paper, the focus so far has mostly been on the former but only
    a little has been done to add physical realism. If we were to define a score of
    digital twinning on a scale of 1–10, a score of 10 will correspond to a situation
    when a digital twin becomes indistinguishable from its physical counterpart to
    an observer. Towards this goal, a hybrid analysis and modeling methodology can
    be developed by combining ML with physics based models to contribute a firm unified
    foundation for the computational modeling and simulation of complex problems that
    arise in numerous multidisciplinary applications. Finally, we would like to highlight
    the importance of standardization. It can be argued that in a fully connected
    and interactive world, different physical assets will be interacting with each
    other and the corresponding digital twins will also have to interact with each
    other. In order to facilitate these interactions there will be a need for standards
    cutting across different domain areas. These standards can range from the file
    format of the data storage, to the details of how the data can be compressed,
    to the data protection requirements addressing differences in the laws when spread
    over different geographical areas. To conclude, the digital twin concept offers
    many new perspectives to our rapidly digitalized society and its seamless interactions
    with many different fields. Combining complementary strengths in physics-based
    and data-driven modeling approaches, the hybrid analysis and modeling framework
    becomes particularly appealing for developing robust digital twin platforms, and
    enables us to make more informed decisions and ask even better questions to mitigate
    challenges relevant to big data cybernetics, security, digitalization, automatization
    and intelligentization. ACKNOWLEDGMENT Adil Rasheed and Trond Kvamsdal acknowledge

    \ \n\"Things\" that are part of the \"Internet of Things\" (IoT) are equipped\
    \ with sensors, software, and network \nconnectivity, giving them the ability\
    \ to gather and share data with one another and with other devices. The \nongoing\
    \ digital transformation is taking place in many different domains, including\
    \ medical, industry, \ntransportation, and urban planning[1]. Connected devices\
    \ and their networks are important to this \ntransformation. This response will\
    \ concentrate on the architecture, applications, and future directions of \npotential\
    \ development of IoT networks.The term \"Internet of Things\" (IoT) describes\
    \ a network of actual \nphysical objects that are linked to the internet and are\
    \ capable of exchanging data and information with one \nanother. These items,\
    \ often known as \"smart devices,\" have sensors, software, and network connectivity\
    \ that \nenable data collection and transmission[2]. Healthcare, industry, transportation,\
    \ and smart cities are just a few of \nthe sectors being transformed by IoT networks.IoT\
    \ networks are becoming more and more significant as \nbusinesses all over the\
    \ world continue to utilize this technology to increase operational effectiveness,\
    \ cut costs, \nand improve customer experience[3]. Over the coming years, the\

    \ of IoT gadgets. \nii. \nSensors: Sensors are used to collect data from the physical\
    \ environment, such as temperature, \nhumidity, pressure, or position. A wide\
    \ range of sensors, such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, \nmicrophones, and cameras,\
    \ can be used by IoT networks. \niii. \nActuators: These parts are used to change\
    \ the environment in response to information gathered by \nsensors. For instance,\
    \ an IoT network may employ actuators to modify a room's temperature or turn on\
    \ \nand off lighting. \niv. \nNetwork Connectivity: IoT devices need to be connected\
    \ to a network to transmit data. Many network \ntechnologies, such as Wi-Fi, cellular\
    \ networks, and Bluetooth, can be used to do this. \nTurkish Journal of Computer\
    \ and Mathematics Education  \nVol.11 No.03 (2020), 2067-2075 \nDOI: https://doi.org/10.17762/turcomat.v11i3.13604\
    \ \n \n \n2070 \n \n \n \nResearch Article  \nv. \nData processing is necessary\
    \ in order to make use of the data that IoT devices collect. This can be \ndone\
    \ on the device itself, on a nearby edge device, or on the cloud. Data analysis,\
    \ aggregation, and \nfiltering are all examples of processing. \nvi. \nStorage:IoT\
    \ networks may store, process, and analyse data using cloud services. These can\
    \ include \nservices for data storage, data analytics, and machine learning. \n\
    vii. \nApplications: Software applications can be used by IoT networks to let\
    \ users interact with and manage \nthe network. These can include mobile or web\
    \ tools that let consumers access and keep tabs on data \ncoming from their Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT) devices. \nviii. \nSecurity: IoT networks need to be secure\
    \ to avoid unauthorized access or modification of data. These \nmay include threat\
    \ detection technologies, access controls, and encryption. \nThese components\
    \ work together to enable IoT networks to collect, process, and send data from\
    \ the real world. \nIoT networks can offer a number of advantages by fusing these\
    \ elements, including increased operational \neffectiveness, lower costs, and\
    \ better user experiences. \nB. Four layers of IoT network architecture \nIoT\
    \ networks can be further divided into blocks or modules, each of which serves\
    \ a particular function. \nDepending on the particular use case of the IoT network,\
    \ these blocks can be organized in a variety of ways. \nSome of the typical building\
    \ blocks or modules for IoT network topologies include the following:All physical\
    \ \ncomponents of the IoT network, such as sensors, actuators, and gateways, are\
    \ included in the device layer. These \ngadgets gather information and talk to\
    \ other gadgets in the network.All network elements that permit \ncommunication\
    \ between devices, such as Wi-Fi routers, gateways, and switches, are included\
    \ in the network \nlayer. The network layer also comprises protocols and technologies,\
    \ such Bluetooth, Zigbee, and LoRa, that \nallow devices to connect with one another.\
    \ \ni. \nCloud Layer: This layer consists of cloud-based services that give the\
    \ IoT network access to storage, \ncompute, and analytics. These services can\
    \ be used to store data, handle data processing and analysis, \nand give end users\
    \ insights. \nii. \nApplication Layer: This layer consists of computer programs\
    \ that give end users access to the \ninformation gathered by the Internet of\
    \ Things network. These programs can be used to display data, \nstart processes,\
    \ and provide notifications. \niii. \nSecurity Layer:The security procedures in\
    \ this layer assure the availability, confidentiality, and \nintegrity of the\
    \ data gathered by the IoT network. Threat detection, access limits, and encryption\
    \ are \nexamples of security measures. \niv. \nDevice Layer:Device management,\
    \ network monitoring, and firmware updates are just a few of the \ntools and services\
    \ that help network administrators manage the IoT network. \nIoT networks can\
    \ be designed in a variety of ways depending on the network's needs and the individual\
    \ use \ncase. IoT networks often depend on a combination of physical objects,\
    \ network elements, cloud-based services, \nsoftware applications, security methods,\
    \ and management tools to operate, regardless of the architecture. \nC. Centralized\
    \ and decentralized networks \ni. \nCentralized Networks: All data gathered by\
    \ IoT devices is transmitted to a central server for \nprocessing and storage\
    \ in a centralized IoT network design. On-site or in the cloud are both viable\
    \ \nlocations for this server. The server is responsible for processing and analyzing\
    \ data, and may also \nserve as a gateway to other systems. As all the data is\
    \ in one place, centralized networks can be simpler \nto manage and maintain.\
    \ Yet, centralized networks may be less scalable and more subject to single \n\
    points of failure. \nii. \nDecentralized Networks: With a decentralized IoT network\
    \ architecture, data processing and storage \nis distributed among different devices\
    \ and systems. For instance, instead of being routed to a \ncentralized server,\
    \ data gathered by IoT devices may be processed and analyzed on the edge, in a\
    \ \nnearby gateway or device. While there are several nodes that can handle data\
    \ processing and storage, \nTurkish Journal of Computer and Mathematics Education\
    \  \nVol.11 No.03 (2020), 2067-2075 \nDOI: https://doi.org/10.17762/turcomat.v11i3.13604\
    \ \n \n \n2071 \n \n \n \nResearch Article  \ndecentralized networks can be more\
    \ scalable and resilient than centralized networks. Decentralized \nnetworks,\
    \ on the other hand, can be trickier to run and maintain because data is dispersed\
    \ throughout \nnumerous hardware and software platforms. \nNetwork topologies\
    \ that are centralized or decentralized each have benefits and drawbacks of their\
    \ own. The \nnetwork's size, the amount of data being collected, whether real-time\
    \ processing is needed, and the required \nlevel of security all play a role in\
    \ the architecture choice. To attain the appropriate level of scalability, \n\
    robustness, and security, certain IoT networks may employ a hybrid architecture,\
    \ which mixes centralized and \ndecentralized features. \nIV. \nApplications of\
    \ IoT Networks \nIoT networks are used in a wide range of fields and businesses,\
    \ including manufacturing, transportation, \nhealthcare, and smart cities. Below\
    \ is a summary of some of the major IoT network-using industries: \ni. \nHealthcare:\
    \ By enabling remote patient monitoring, streamlining hospital operations, and\
    \ giving real-\ntime patient data, IoT networks can improve patient outcomes and\
    \ lower expenses. IoT devices, for \ninstance, can be used to track patients with\
    \ long-term diseases like diabetes or heart disease and notify \nmedical professionals\
    \ of any changes in their state. \nii. \nManufacturing: By providing real-time\
    \ monitoring of production processes and equipment, IoT \nnetworks can assist\
    \ increase operational efficiency and decrease downtime. IoT sensors, for instance,\
    \ \ncan be used to monitor machine performance and anticipate maintenance requirements\
    \ prior to a \nbreakdown. \niii. \nTransportation: IoT networks can aid in enhancing\
    \ user experience, reducing congestion, and \nimproving safety in the transportation\
    \ sector. IoT sensors, for instance, can be used to track traffic \npatterns and\
    \ modify traffic lights to improve flow. \nIoT networks have the potential to\
    \ enhance urban environments' sustainability, safety, and livability. IoT sensors,\
    \ \nfor instance, can be used to monitor air quality, control energy use, and\
    \ improve waste management. \nA. Examples of specific use cases \nThe following\
    \ are some particular use cases for IoT networks: \na) Smart Homes: IoT devices\
    \ can be utilised to build energy-efficient, safe, and simple to maintain smart\
    \ \nhouses. For instance, IoT-enabled security systems can send out real-time\
    \ notifications if there is any \nunexpected activity in the home, while IoT-enabled\
    \ thermostats can automatically adjust the \ntemperature based on user preferences\
    \ and occupancy. \nb) Asset tracking: IoT networks can be used to track assets\
    \ like inventory, equipment, and vehicles in real \ntime. For example, IoT sensors\
    \ can be used to monitor the location and condition of products in transit, \n\
    enabling organizations to optimize their supply chain operations. \nc) Environmental\
    \ Monitoring: IoT networks can be used to keep an eye on things like weather patterns,\
    \ \nwater quality, and air quality. IoT sensors, for instance, can be used to\
    \ forecast weather patterns or \nidentify pollution levels in streams to assist\
    \ stop natural disasters. \nd) Agriculture: Agricultural operations including\
    \ irrigation, fertilizer, and pest control can be monitored \nand optimized via\
    \ IoT networks. IoT sensors, for instance, can be used to enhance crop development\
    \ \nand output by monitoring soil moisture levels and adjusting irrigation systems.\
    \ \n \nV. \nIV. Future Directions of IoT Networks \nA. Emerging trends in IoT\
    \ networks \nDigital twins are virtual reproductions of actual systems or gadgets.\
    \ They can be used to imitate the behavior of \nsystems in the real world because\
    \ they are developed using sensor data. Design, testing, and maintenance of IoT\
    \ \nsystems and devices can be made better with the use of digital twins. \nTurkish\

    Research Article  \ni. \nFog Computing: A decentralized computing architecture\
    \ known as fog computing puts processing \npower closer to Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT) devices. Although though it uses a more distributed \nmethodology, it\
    \ is comparable to edge computing. For real-time IoT applications, data processing\
    \ speed \nand latency reduction are essential, and fog computing can help. \n\
    ii. \nHybrid Cloud: A hybrid cloud is an infrastructure that combines public and\
    \ private clouds. IoT \nnetworks may balance their needs for affordability, scalability,\
    \ and security with the aid of hybrid \nclouds. For instance, private cloud infrastructure\
    \ can be used to store sensitive data whereas public \ncloud infrastructure can\
    \ be used to store less sensitive data. \niii. \nHuman-Machine Interfaces (HMIs):\
    \ HMIs allow users to communicate with IoT systems and devices. \nHMIs come in\
    \ tactile, aural, and visual forms. These could aid in enhancing IoT networks'\
    \ usability and \naccessibility. \niv. \nPredictive Maintenance: In order to forecast\
    \ when maintenance is necessary before equipment fails, \npredictive maintenance\
    \ uses data from IoT sensors. Reduced downtime, increased dependability, and \n\
    lower maintenance costs can all be a result of predictive maintenance. \nv. \n\
    Smart Energy: To maximize energy efficiency and minimize waste, smart energy utilises\
    \ IoT networks. \nIoT sensors, for instance, can be used to track energy use in\
    \ buildings and modify heating or lighting \nbased on occupancy levels. \nvi.\
    \ \nVoice Recognition: Voice-activated instructions and IoT device control are\
    \ made possible by speech \nrecognition technologies. Speech recognition can help\
    \ make IoT networks more convenient and \naccessible. \n \nB. Edge computing and\
    \ 5G networks \nThe adoption of edge computing and 5G networks is one of the most\
    \ important trends in IoT networks. Instead \nof transmitting data to a central\
    \ server for processing, edge computing uses devices at the network's edge to\
    \ \nprocess data. Many IoT applications depend on low latency and quick reaction\
    \ times, which can be achieved \nwith this method. Contrarily, 5G networks provide\
    \ greater bandwidth and lower latency than earlier wireless \nnetwork generations,\
    \ making them ideal for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. \nC. Artificial\
    \ Intelligence and Machine Learning \nThe growing application of machine learning\
    \ (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) technology in IoT networks is \nanother\
    \ trend. IoT devices can benefit from AI and ML to improve decision-making and\
    \ automate processes like \nanomaly detection and predictive maintenance. Costs\
    \ can be cut, productivity can be increased, and the user \nexperience can be\
    \ improved. \nD. Blockchain technology \nIn IoT networks, blockchain technology\
    \ is another new development. Blockchain is a distributed ledger \ntechnology\
    \ that makes transactions safe, open, and impenetrable. Blockchain can be utilized\
    \ in IoT networks to \nbuild secure, decentralized systems that are impervious\
    \ to hackers or tampering. Blockchain technology, for \ninstance, can be applied\
    \ to develop a safe and open supply chain management system that can monitor the\
    \ flow \nof commodities from manufacture to delivery.IoT networks have a promising\
    \ future, filled with both exciting \nprospects and difficult obstacles. To ensure\
    \ that IoT networks can reach their full potential as the technology \ndevelops,\
    \ it will be crucial to solve challenges like privacy, security, and interoperability.\
    \ \nVI. \nChallenges & Limitations of IoT Network \nIoT networks provide many\
    \ benefits, but they also present a number of obstacles and constraints that need\
    \ to be \novercome. We will look at a few of these difficulties and their potential\
    \ effects in this section. \nA. Privacy and Security Issues \nTurkish Journal\
    \ of Computer and Mathematics Education  \nVol.11 No.03 (2020), 2067-2075 \nDOI:\
    \ https://doi.org/10.17762/turcomat.v11i3.13604 \n \n \n2073 \n \n \n \nResearch\
    \ Article  \nSecurity and privacy issues are one of the biggest problems facing\
    \ IoT networks. Given that there are billions of \ninternet-connected gadgets,\
    \ the possibility of cyberattacks and data breaches is a major worry. IoT devices\
    \ \nsometimes have poor security safeguards, which leaves them open to hacking\
    \ and other online dangers. \nFurthermore, IoT devices frequently gather and send\
    \ sensitive data, such private health information, \nnecessitating strong privacy\
    \ measures. \nB. Problems with Interoperability and Compatibility \nInteroperability\
    \ and compatibility problems are another difficulty facing IoT networks. IoT systems\
    \ and devices \nare frequently created by several manufacturers and may employ\
    \ various communication protocols or standards. \nAs a result, integrating equipment\
    \ from many manufacturers and developing a cohesive system may be difficult. \n\
    Additionally, the demand for interoperability and compatibility will only increase\
    \ as IoT networks develop. \nC. Congestion in the Network and Scalability \nScalability\
    \ and network congestion are additional issues that IoT networks must deal with.\
    \ The need for \nbandwidth and other network resources increases along with the\
    \ number of devices connected to the network. \nThis may cause network congestion,\
    \ which may have an effect on how well IoT applications work. Scaling the \nnetwork\
    \ infrastructure to meet the rising demand might be difficult as the number of\
    \ IoT devices keeps \nincreasing. \nD. Battery Life and Power Use \nFor IoT networks,\
    \ power consumption and battery life are major obstacles. Many Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT) \ndevices run on batteries and can be found in far-off or challenging-to-reach\
    \ places. This makes it difficult to \nchange batteries or recharge devices, which\
    \ may affect the network's overall dependability and performance. In \naddition,\
    \ power consumption will become a more pressing issue as the number of IoT devices\
    \ increases.IoT \nnetworks provide many advantages, but there are also a number\
    \ of problems and restrictions that need to be \nworked around. IoT networks may\
    \ realize their full potential by creating strong security and privacy measures,\
    \ \naddressing interoperability and compatibility challenges, managing network\
    \ congestion, and minimizing power \nusage. \nVII. \nConclusion \nWe have covered\
    \ the architecture, applications, and anticipated future developments of IoT networks\
    \ in this \npaper. We have looked at an IoT network's four-tiered architecture\
    \ and all of its components, such as sensors, \ngateways, cloud platforms, and\
    \ apps. We have also discussed the various applications of IoT networks in a \n\
    variety of fields, including healthcare, industry, transportation, and even smart\
    \ cities.We have also looked into \nthe most recent advancements in the Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT), such as edge computing, 5G networks, AI, and \nblockchain.\
    \ The usefulness and value of IoT networks may rise as a result of these tendencies.IoT\
    \ networks \nprovide a lot of advantages, but they also have some disadvantages\
    \ that need to be dealt with. This includes \nproblems with energy use, battery\
    \ life, interoperability, scalability, security, and privacy. It also includes\
    \ \nproblems with network congestion.To fully realize the potential of IoT networks,\
    \ future research should focus \non fixing these problems and overcoming these\
    \ limitations. Managing network congestion, optimizing energy \nuse, creating\
    \ robust security and privacy measures, and resolving interoperability and compatibility\
    \ issues are a \nfew of them.IoT networks, which have the potential to revolutionize\
    \ numerous industries and raise people's \nliving standards everywhere, represent\
    \ a significant advancement in technology. With further research and \ndevelopment,\
    \ IoT networks will without a doubt play a significant role in determining the\
    \ direction of \ntechnology and society. \nReferences \n[1] Al-Fuqaha, A., Guizani,\

    \ walls (VGWs)—growing plants on vertical walls inside or outside\nbuildings—have\
    \ been suggested as a nature-based solution to improve air quality and comfort\n\
    in modern cities. However, as with other greenery systems (e.g., agriculture),\
    \ managing VGW\nsystems requires adequate temporal and spatial monitoring of the\
    \ plants as well as the surrounding\nenvironment. Remote sensing cameras and small,\
    \ low-cost sensors have become increasingly valuable\nfor conventional vegetation\
    \ monitoring; nevertheless, they have rarely been used in VGWs. In this\ndescriptive\
    \ paper, we present a ﬁrst-of-its-kind remote sensing high-throughput monitoring\
    \ system\nin a VGW workplace. The system includes low- and high-cost sensors,\
    \ thermal and hyperspectral\nremote sensing cameras, and in situ gas-exchange\
    \ measurements. In addition, air temperature,\nrelative humidity, and carbon dioxide\
    \ concentrations are constantly monitored in the operating\nworkplace room (scientiﬁc\
    \ computer lab) where the VGW is established, while data are continuously\nstreamed\
    \ online to an analytical and visualization web application. Artiﬁcial Intelligence\
    \ is used to\nautomatically monitor changes across the living wall. Preliminary\
    \ results of our unique monitoring\nsystem are presented under actual working\
    \ room conditions while discussing future directions and\npotential applications\
    \ of such a high-throughput remote sensing VGW system.\nKeywords: artiﬁcial intelligence\

    \ vertical\ngreen living wall (VGW)\n1. Vertical Green Living Walls (VGWs) as\
    \ an Urban Nature-Based Solution (NBS)\nNature-based solutions (NBSs) refer to\
    \ efforts aimed at tackling socio-environmental\nchallenges by the use of nature\
    \ through sustainable management. As part of NBS, the\nconcept of “green” cities\
    \ has been recommended for sustainable urban development [1,2].\nThe idea is to\
    \ introduce vegetation into spaces within the urban fabric to reduce the heat\n\
    island effect and air pollution in the city [3]. Such a solution could also support\
    \ efforts to\nachieve carbon-neutral cities since plants uptake CO2 from the environment.\
    \ The European\nCommission has proposed such a solution, which was recently adopted\
    \ by Horizon 2030\nas one of the potential strategies to meet the goal of carbon-free\
    \ cities [4].\nSince introducing new parks and gardens in the urban fabric is\
    \ not straightforward, as\nfree spaces are rarely found in modern cities, deploying\
    \ vertical greening systems may be\nthe optimal solution. Introducing vertical\
    \ green systems into the city where the vegetation\nis grown on new or existing\
    \ vertical walls has great potential as an NBS. These vertical\ngreen living systems\
    \ (VGSs) are presently found in indoor and outdoor environments\nthrough a plethora\
    \ of growing techniques [5–7]. However, the main challenge of such NBSs\nis understanding\
    \ how these VGSs respond to and affect the urban environment. Another\nRemote\

    \ direction, in this paper, we distinguish\nsuch systems from systems that grow\
    \ vegetation on a vertical wall, where plants grow\nmostly in the horizontal direction\

    \ \n2 of 16 \n \nsuch NBSs is understanding how these VGSs respond to and affect\

    \ direction (Figure 1a). We name such systems as vertical \ngreen wall (VGW) systems\
    \ and use this term throughout this paper. \n \nFigure 1. Front view of (a) the\

    \ of 30 cm from each other. The vertical \nmap shown in (b) was generated using\
    \ multilevel b-spline interpolation in QGIS. \nWhile extensive research exists\
    \ on the effects of cooling [8] and humidity regulation \n[9,10], as well as the\
    \ reduction in air pollutants [11–13], carbon dioxide [14], and particu-\nlate\
    \ matter [15,16], of both indoor and outdoor VGSs and VGWs, most of the studies\
    \ are \nfocused on conventional horizontal planting systems and traditional potted\
    \ plants. Since \nthe vertical living wall approaches are a recent innovation,\
    \ little is known about the po-\ntential impacts of such new horticultural living\
    \ walls, known as VGW systems, on indoor \nair quality and comfort [17]. The increased\
    \ plant density of VGW systems, vertical align-\nment, and higher areal and microflora\
    \ exposure likely have distinct environmental im-\npacts compared with the traditional\
    \ potted systems [18,19]. \nThe little-known fact about these systems through\
    \ the few existing studies is that \nindoor VGW systems can reduce formaldehyde\
    \ [20] and efficiently filter indoor particu-\nlate matter [11]. Recent studies\
    \ also showed that VGW systems can reduce indoor carbon \ndioxide [14]. However,\
    \ most of these studies are held in small cells or tiny room spaces \nunder controlled\
    \ conditions. High levels of indoor carbon dioxide are known to affect \nworking\
    \ performance. For example, research conducted at the Harvard T.H. Chan School\
    \ \nof Public Health showed that office workers increased their cognitive performance\
    \ when \nexposed to a more ventilated room with lower carbon dioxide levels [21].\
    \ Thus, indoor \nVGWs can potentially improve indoor air quality in workplaces,\
    \ providing the required \nenvironment for better working conditions. However,\
    \ a major challenge remains the spa-\ntiotemporally continuous monitoring of the\
    \ performance of the VGW and its effect on the \nsurrounding environment. \n10\

    \ For example, research conducted at the Harvard T.H. Chan School\nof Public Health\
    \ showed that ofﬁce workers increased their cognitive performance when\nexposed\
    \ to a more ventilated room with lower carbon dioxide levels [21]. Thus, indoor\n\
    VGWs can potentially improve indoor air quality in workplaces, providing the required\n\
    environment for better working conditions. However, a major challenge remains\
    \ the\nspatiotemporally continuous monitoring of the performance of the VGW and\

    \ of 16\n2. Using Remote-Sensing-Based Precision Agriculture Tools in VGWs\nIn\
    \ terms of effect, the spatial dimension of the VGW system is crucial. To provide\n\
    recommendations regarding the total area of the VGW system needed to reduce carbon\n\
    dioxide in a room with a speciﬁc volume, for example, it is necessary to assess\
    \ its spatial\neffect, which includes knowing the response at a given planting\
    \ density as well as the plant\ntype response to ambient and elevated CO2 conditions.\
    \ While most studies explore the\neffects of living systems by measuring air quality\
    \ in the room, how different wall parts react\nto their surrounding environment\
    \ is still unknown. This effect may further change across\nthe wall and through\
    \ time. The same plant, for example, may respond differently due to\nits position\
    \ in the wall because of the different exposure to local environmental conditions\n\
    (e.g., light, ventilation, water supply, etc.). This spatial information is required\
    \ to monitor\nand manage such systems properly.\nToday, VGWs are expected to be\
    \ automatically or semi-automatically maintained to\nbecome efﬁcient systems.\
    \ In that sense, proximal sensing, using cameras that measure\nthe spectral and\
    \ thermal signals reﬂected and emitted by the plants on the wall, can be\nleveraged\
    \ to monitor variations across the VGW as well as to effectively manage such\n\
    systems through smart decision support systems. Using proximal and remote sensing\
    \ to\ntrack the performance of VGWs in carbon dioxide and temperature reduction\
    \ capacity\nwhile associating spatial changes across the wall to variations in\
    \ indoor environmental\nconditions is a promising management solution for these\
    \ innovative NBS systems [22].\nThe general idea is to deploy precision agriculture\
    \ techniques developed and used in\nconventional farming (horizontal vegetation\
    \ systems) in VGW systems. For example, the\nphotochemical reﬂectance index (PRI),\
    \ which is based on spectral data acquired from proxi-\nmal or remote sensing,\
    \ was found to be associated with volatile organic compounds [23], as\nwell as\
    \ photosynthetic traits [24,25]. Thus, using spectral images of the proper wavelength\n\
    bands may allow the generation of the wall’s PRI maps through time. This information\
    \ may\nbe beneﬁcial to monitoring changes in CO2 uptake across the wall, helping\
    \ automatically or\nsemi-automatically manage the VGW system and improving its\
    \ efﬁcacy in reducing indoor\ncarbon dioxide concentrations. Models driven by\
    \ spectral-based vegetation indices [26–28]\ncan be used to provide a spatial\
    \ assessment of the plants’ water use and carbon uptake rates\nacross the VGW.\
    \ Thermal information, commonly used to assess water stress conditions in\ncrops\
    \ and trees [29–31], may also be used to determine transpiration rates across\
    \ the VGW\nsystem for irrigation control purposes.\nThis short descriptive paper\
    \ presents a ﬁrst-of-its-kind high-throughput monitoring\nsystem of an indoor\
    \ VGW that includes low- and high-cost sensors, thermal and hyperspec-\ntral remote\
    \ sensing, and in situ gas-exchange measurements. In addition, air temperature,\n\
    relative humidity, and carbon dioxide concentrations are constantly monitored\
    \ in an oper-\nating workplace room (scientiﬁc computer lab) where the VGW is\
    \ established, while data\nare continuously streamed online to an analytical and\

    \ bright indirect\nlight conditions. Ideal temperatures for this species range\
    \ from 16 ◦C to 26 ◦C, and\npH from 6 to 8 [33]. According to the American Society\
    \ for the Prevention of Cruelty to\nAnimals, P. obtusifolia is non-toxic for humans\
    \ and animals [34].\n3.1.2. Tradescantia spathacea\nAlso known as “Moses in the\
    \ cradle”, “boat lily”, and “wandering jew”, this plant\nis native to tropical\
    \ areas such as Belize, Guatemala, and southern Mexico. It can be an\nunderstory\
    \ plant in coastal forests, shrublands, pinelands, hammocks, secondary forests,\n\
    cultivated grounds, and disturbed areas from sea level to low elevations [35].\
    \ T. spathacea\nmay reach a maximum height of 30–50 cm. It is a very fast-growing\
    \ species, easy to\nmaintain. T. spathacea preferred conditions are warm and humid,\
    \ with temperatures\nranging from 14 ◦C to 27 ◦C [36]. It can be found in indoor\
    \ and outdoor growing systems.\nT. spathacea can be toxic to animals and humans\
    \ [37].\n3.1.3. Chlorophytum comosum\nUsually known as the “spider plant”, this\
    \ is a perennial ﬂowering plant native to\ntropical and southern Africa but was\
    \ introduced to other parts of the world, such as western\nAustralia [38]. It\
    \ is easy to grow as a houseplant, prospering under various environmental\nconditions.\
    \ C. comosum is well-known for its medicinal characteristics [38]. The ideal\n\
    temperatures in which this species grow and develop range from 15 ◦C to 30 ◦C,\
    \ with pH\nrecommended levels of 6 to 6.5. C. comosum was found by the NASA Clean\
    \ Air Study to\neffectively remove common household air toxins such as formaldehyde\
    \ and xylene [39]. It\nis not toxic to animals and humans [34].\n3.1.4. Spathiphyllum\
    \ wallisii\nUsually called “peace lily”, it is a genus of more than 47 species\
    \ of monocotyledonous\nﬂowering plants from the Araceae family, which are very\
    \ popular as indoor house plants.\nThis species is native to tropical regions\
    \ of the Americas and southeastern Asia. The\nevergreen herbaceous perennial plants\
    \ have large leaves of 12–65 cm long and 3–25 cm\nbroad. The ﬂowers are produced\
    \ in a spadix, surrounded by a white, yellowish, or greenish\nRemote Sens. 2022,\
    \ 14, 3485\n6 of 16\nspathe. Spathiphyllum requires relatively small amounts of\
    \ light and water. It is also known\nto remove household air toxins such as benzene\
    \ and formaldehyde [39]. Recommended\npH levels for this species are 5.6 to 6.5.\
    \ S. wallisii can be toxic to animals and humans [40].\n3.1.5. Aeschynanthus radicans\n\
    This plant is usually named “Monalisa” and “lipstick plant” because of its beautiful,\n\
    red-colored scarlet ﬂowers that open from buds resembling lipstick tubes. It is\
    \ native to\nMalaysia and may grow to a height of 1.5 m. The ideal temperature\
    \ for this species is 15 to\n30 ◦C, with required pH levels of 6–8. The Monalisa\
    \ is non-toxic to animals and humans [34].\nIts best light conditions are bright\
    \ indirect light, best grown indoors.\n3.1.6. Philodendron hederaceum\nPhilodendron\
    \ is an evergreen climber plant native to North and South American tropical\n\
    areas [41]. Taxonomically, the genus Philodendron is still poorly known, with\
    \ many unde-\nscribed species. It can grow to a height of 3–6 m, with a temperature\
    \ requirement of 15 to\n26 ◦C and pH levels ranging between 4.5 and 6. The recommended\
    \ light conditions are\nmoderate-to-bright diffusive light. P. hederaceum can\
    \ be toxic to animals and humans [40].\n3.2. The Working Space and Its Indoor\
    \ Environmental Monitoring System\nThe M&M-VS lab is an Agritech workplace of\
    \ approximately 46 m2, with a total\nvolume of about 140 m3. The lab is equipped\
    \ with desktop workstations, and typically 2 to\n8 students work in the lab simultaneously.\
    \ Typical working hours are from 8 am to 8 pm.\nAir conditioning in the room is\
    \ set at 25 ◦C, and fresh air is supplied through a mixing\nventilation system\
    \ (from the top) with an air exchange rate of 0.25–1.5 h−1.\nThe indoor conditions\
    \ were continuously monitored via a set of sensors, including air\ntemperature\
    \ and relative humidity (RH) sensors (T/RH sensors of Xiaomi, Beijing, China,\n\
    and an HMP155 sensor, Vaisala, Finland) distributed across the room in the horizontal\
    \ and\nvertical directions (Figure 2). In addition, a people-counting sensor was\
    \ placed at the lab\nentrance to monitor the number of people in the room at any\
    \ given time. A series of 10 inlet\ntubes injected air into a gas analyzer (Serinus\
    \ 31, Ecotech Pty Ltd., Sydney, Australia),\nlocated behind the wall, at different\
    \ distances from the VGW (0.1, 0.35, 0.8, 2, and 3 m\nfrom the wall and 0.8 m\
    \ from the top) and to varying heights near the wall (at a distance of\n10 cm\
    \ from the wall and 0.8, 1.2, 1.9, and 2.5 m from the top) in addition to two\
    \ external\ninlet tubes that sample the outdoor air at the northern and southern\
    \ sides of the building\n(Figure 2). The eight internal and two outer tubes provided\
    \ horizontal and vertical CO2\nproﬁles across the transect from the wall towards\
    \ the room’s center and from the top to the\nﬂoor, as well as outdoor CO2 conditions.\n\
    The CO2 sampling was conducted via a microswitch system that injects air from\n\
    10 inlet tubes for 3 min each. The sampled air was streamed from the inlet tube\
    \ to the\ngas analyzer at a constant rate using a 1 L reciprocating vacuum pump.\
    \ To avoid air\ncontamination from the previous tube, we wrote a Python code that\
    \ excludes the ﬁrst\ntwo minutes of data after the valve opens. That way, we could\
    \ investigate the “clean”\nair from the speciﬁc opened tube. This resulted in\
    \ a 30 min cycle of the 10 sampling\ntubes at different distances and heights\
    \ from the VGW (see “CO2 inlet” in Figure 2). Air\ntemperature, RH, and solar\
    \ radiation were also monitored outside the building (Figure 2).\nData were streamed\
    \ to and displayed in, Grafana, a multiplatform, open-source\nanalytics and interactive\
    \ data-visualization web application (https://grafana.com; accessed\non 1 June\
    \ 2022). This enables a continuous, real-time data visualization at a relatively\
    \ high\nfrequency, with some basic, on-the-ﬂy analytical capabilities (Figure\
    \ 3).\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 3485\n7 of 16\ndifferent distances and heights from\

    \ \n3.3. Leaf Level Gas Exchange Measurements \nWe used LiCOR devices (LI-6800\
    \ and LI-600, LiCOR, NE, USA; Figure 4a,b) to mon-\nitor level leaf gas-exchange\
    \ rates. Measurements of leaf transpiration, CO2 assimilation, \nand stomatal\
    \ conductance were conducted periodically once every three weeks on aver-\nage\
    \ on each of the six species to characterize their light use efficiencies and\
    \ carbon uptake \ncapacities. A total of three leaves were sampled per species\
    \ per date to maintain a mini-\nmum interval of time between the leaf measurements\
    \ and the images. In addition, the \nactual transpiration was measured with the\
    \ LI-600 porometer on a total of 60 to 90 random \nleaves across the wall (10–15\
    \ leaves per species) every month. \nOur preliminary single leaf results showed\
    \ that the six species grown on the indoor \nVGW had a diverse response to increasing\
    \ ambient CO2 concentrations (Figure 4c).  \nSince intercellular CO2 concentration\
    \ (Ci) can be taken as 70% of the ambient concen-\ntration in C3 plants [42],\
    \ the A–Ci curve can provide information regarding the effective-\nness of the\
    \ species in reducing CO2 levels in the room through the process of carbon as-\n\
    similation. For example, Peperomia seemed to reach a maximum assimilation rate\
    \ of ~7 \nμmol m−2 s−1 at 600 ppmv (light green arrow in Figure 4c). At the same\
    \ time, Philodendron, \nwhich had the lowest response to elevated CO2 with ~5\
    \ μmol m−2 s−1, reached its maxi-\nmum assimilation capacity at a much lower intercellular\
    \ CO2 concentration (Ci) of only \n300 ppmv (dark green arrow in Figure 4c). This\
    \ means that, under light conditions of 300 \nμmol photons m−2 s−1, Peperomia\
    \ was 40% more efficient in reducing indoor CO2 concen-\ntrations, with increased\
    \ assimilation up to 600 ppm. This information can help us design \nFigure 3.\

    \ Measurements\nWe used LiCOR devices (LI-6800 and LI-600, LiCOR, NE, USA; Figure\
    \ 4a,b) to monitor\nlevel leaf gas-exchange rates. Measurements of leaf transpiration,\
    \ CO2 assimilation, and\nstomatal conductance were conducted periodically once\

    \ were sampled per species per date to maintain a minimum\ninterval of time between\
    \ the leaf measurements and the images. In addition, the actual\ntranspiration\
    \ was measured with the LI-600 porometer on a total of 60 to 90 random leaves\n\
    across the wall (10–15 leaves per species) every month.\nOur preliminary single\
    \ leaf results showed that the six species grown on the indoor\nVGW had a diverse\
    \ response to increasing ambient CO2 concentrations (Figure 4c).\nSince intercellular\
    \ CO2 concentration (Ci) can be taken as 70% of the ambient concen-\ntration in\
    \ C3 plants [42], the A–Ci curve can provide information regarding the effectiveness\n\
    of the species in reducing CO2 levels in the room through the process of carbon\
    \ assimilation.\nFor example, Peperomia seemed to reach a maximum assimilation\
    \ rate of ~7 µmol m−2 s−1\nat 600 ppmv (light green arrow in Figure 4c). At the\
    \ same time, Philodendron, which had the\nlowest response to elevated CO2 with\
    \ ~5 µmol m−2 s−1, reached its maximum assimilation\ncapacity at a much lower\
    \ intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci) of only 300 ppmv (dark green\narrow in\
    \ Figure 4c). This means that, under light conditions of 300 µmol photons m−2\
    \ s−1,\nPeperomia was 40% more efﬁcient in reducing indoor CO2 concentrations,\
    \ with increased\nassimilation up to 600 ppm. This information can help us design\

    \ a ﬁrst-of-its-kind remote sensing high-throughput\nindoor VGW system that may\
    \ serve as a pilot for the automatic (or semi-automatic) moni-\ntoring of indoor/outdoor\
    \ vertical greenery systems. There is still a need for model devel-\nopment to\
    \ take the unprocessed remote sensing data and produce meaningful information\n\
    that will aid in managing VGWs (e.g., [26,27,62]). However, combining spectral\
    \ indices,\nsuch as those presented in this study, with gas exchange and other\
    \ biophysical parameters\nmay help produce a spatially continuous picture of the\
    \ status of the living wall. Thermal\ninformation may also assist in detecting\
    \ early stresses [22,31] or quantifying the plant’s\nwater use [29]. Such models\
    \ can produce spatially continuous, real-time status maps of\nthe VGW.\nRemote\
    \ Sens. 2022, 14, 3485\n13 of 16\nThe next step is to use this information to\
    \ learn about the functioning of VGWs\nand their feedback and impact on the surrounding\
    \ environment. Such a step is essential\nto improve indoor and outdoor conditions\
    \ more efﬁciently. Artiﬁcial intelligence (AI)\nmay play a critical role in this\
    \ task. AI algorithms are already being used to accurately\nacquire information\
    \ about indoor environmental quality from low-cost sensors [63]. In\nthis context,\
    \ AI can be combined with remote sensing to detect plant disease, which may\n\
    assist in managing VGWs [64]. Hyperspectral data can be leveraged to alert on\
    \ disease\ndevelopment across the living wall even before it is detected by our\
    \ bare eyes or the use of\nRGB images.\nAnomaly detection using AI was also shown\
    \ to support the predictive maintenance of\nVGWs’ indoor environment [65]. The\
    \ core task to achieve VGWs’ predictive maintenance\nis to recognize anomalous\
    \ changes as early as possible across the wall (from time series of\nremote sensing\
    \ images) and in the indoor environment (from low-cost sensors spread across\n\
    the room). A decision support system can then be used to control and manipulate\
    \ the VGW\nconditions through, for example, changing the light conditions, irrigation\
    \ scheme, and room\nventilation rate. This idea of combining low-cost sensors,\
    \ remote sensing imaging, and AI\nin a decision support system is already being\
    \ implemented in conventional agriculture\n(e.g., [66–68]). However, this might\
    \ require special adjustments to indoor VGW systems,\nwhich must be guided through\
    \ further research. In the meantime, more VGW monitoring\nsystems such as the\
    \ one described in this paper may open new opportunities to develop\nsmart techniques\
    \ for managing VGWs and study these systems under different conditions\nand with\
    \ various plant species and monitoring solutions.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization,\

    \ key factors inﬂuencing smart building integration into smart cities\nconsidering\
    \ the city as a technological system. This paper begins with an overview of the\
    \ concept of\nsmart buildings, deﬁning their features and discussing the technological\
    \ advancements driving their\ndevelopment. The frameworks for smart buildings\
    \ are presented, emphasizing energy efﬁciency,\nsustainability, automation, and\
    \ data analytics. Then, the concept of a smart city and the role of\ndigitalization\
    \ in its development is explored. The conceptual framework of smart building into\
    \ a\nsmart city is presented, contributing to understanding the complex process\
    \ of integrating smart\nbuildings into smart cities. Further research delves into\
    \ the factors inﬂuencing the integration of\nsmart buildings into smart cities,\
    \ focusing on energy, mobility, water, security systems, and waste\nmanagement\
    \ infrastructure domains. Each thematic area is examined, highlighting the importance\n\
    of integration and the associated challenges and opportunities, based on research\
    \ in the literature\nand the analysis of case studies. This enables the identiﬁcation\
    \ of 26 factors inﬂuencing integration\nand the synthesis of ﬁndings. The ﬁndings\
    \ indicate that the successful integration of smart buildings\ninto smart cities\
    \ requires attention to multiple factors related to smart energy, smart mobility,\
    \ smart\nwater, smart security, and smart waste management infrastructures. The\
    \ results obtained from this\nresearch provide valuable insights into the factors\
    \ inﬂuencing smart building integration into a smart\ncity from a technological\
    \ perspective, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions and develop\n\
    strategies paving the way for sustainable, resilient, and efﬁcient urban environments.\n\

    \ with an estimated 4.6 billion\npeople, accounting for 58% of the global population,\
    \ residing in urban areas by 2025. This\nproportion may reach as high as 81% in\
    \ certain developed regions. This demographic\nshift presents signiﬁcant challenges\
    \ for city planners, who must devise strategies to ensure\nsustainable living\
    \ conditions for the growing urban population [1]. One potential solution\nlies\
    \ in the development of smart cities and smart buildings. However, the lack of\
    \ a\nuniversally accepted deﬁnition for these concepts poses a challenge, making\
    \ it essential to\ngain a comprehensive understanding and establish a consensus\
    \ on the precise meaning of\nsmart cities and smart buildings.\nBy embracing the\
    \ principles of smart cities and integrating smart buildings into urban\ninfrastructure,\
    \ cities can enhance their efﬁciency, sustainability, and quality of life [2].\n\
    The concept of a smart city encompasses various infrastructure domains such as\
    \ energy,\nmobility, water, security, and waste management, where digital technologies\
    \ and data-\ndriven solutions play a crucial role [3]. Similarly, smart buildings\
    \ embody advanced\ntechnologies and systems that optimize resource utilization,\
    \ improve occupant comfort,\nand enable efﬁcient operation and management [4].\n\
    Smart Cities 2023, 6, 1832–1857. https://doi.org/10.3390/smartcities6040085\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/smartcities\nSmart Cities 2023, 6\n1833\nTo fully\
    \ harness the potential of smart buildings, it is essential to integrate the function-\n\
    alities proposed by various smart city infrastructure domains and, reciprocally,\
    \ leverage the\nrecommended features of smart building services to beneﬁt the\
    \ surrounding systems [2].\nHowever, in many cases, urban infrastructure components\
    \ operate independently without\nintegration. Therefore, a comprehensive approach\
    \ is necessary to maximize the capabilities\nof smart infrastructure and develop\
    \ smart cities effectively. Collaborative efforts involving\nscientists from diverse\
    \ ﬁelds, policymakers, planners, managers, civil society representa-\ntives, and\
    \ other relevant stakeholders prove to be advantageous and effective [5,6].\n\
    The integration of smart building features suggested by smart city infrastructure\n\
    domains implies that buildings should be designed to facilitate seamless interaction\
    \ with\nexisting and anticipated city infrastructure [7]. Potential strategies\
    \ may involve the inte-\ngration of intelligent infrastructure within urban areas,\
    \ such as the convergence of smart\nbuildings with the city’s smart grid to optimize\
    \ energy consumption [8], establishing con-\nnections between smart buildings\
    \ and public transportation to mitigate environmental\nimpact [8–10], or implementing\
    \ intelligent waste management systems that align with the\ncity’s existing waste\
    \ management infrastructure.\nThe integration of smart buildings into the existing\
    \ smart city systems is a topic of\nincreasing interest and importance [11]. As\
    \ urban populations continue to grow and the\ndemand for resources escalates,\
    \ it becomes imperative to explore innovative solutions\nthat maximize the utilization\
    \ of available resources while minimizing their environmental\nimpact [12]. Smart\
    \ building integration offers a promising avenue for achieving these goals\nby\
    \ incorporating advanced technologies, automation, and data-driven systems into\
    \ the\ndesign, construction, and operation of buildings [13].\nBy adopting an\
    \ integrated approach and incorporating the suggested features of smart\ndomain\
    \ infrastructure domains into smart building design [7], cities can capitalize\
    \ on the\nsynergistic beneﬁts that arise from the harmonious interaction between\
    \ buildings and\ntheir surrounding infrastructure. These strategies enable resource\
    \ optimization, enhanced\nsustainability, and improved quality of life for urban\
    \ residents [14,15].\nTo address the challenges and complexities associated with\
    \ the integration of smart\nbuildings into smart cities, this research aims to\
    \ analyze the key technological factors that\ninﬂuence this integration. By identifying\
    \ these factors and understanding their implications,\npolicymakers, urban planners,\
    \ and stakeholders can make informed decisions and develop\neffective strategies\
    \ for successful integration. The research will contribute to the existing\nbody\
    \ of knowledge by providing insights into the multifaceted aspects of smart building\n\
    integration into a smart city and highlighting the importance of addressing energy\
    \ efﬁciency,\nmobility, water conservation, security, and waste management in\
    \ the context of smart\ncities. Ultimately, this research seeks to pave the way\
    \ for sustainable and resilient urban\nenvironments that can cater to the needs\
    \ of the expanding urban population.\nThe paper’s structure is organized as follows.\
    \ Firstly, an exploration of the concept of\nsmart building, including the requirements\
    \ and frameworks for successful implementation\nis carried out. This is followed\
    \ by the concept of a smart city, highlighting the importance\nof digitalization\
    \ and its impact on various infrastructure domains within a smart city.\nSubsequently,\
    \ the paper focuses on the integration of smart buildings into smart cities,\n\
    presenting a conceptual framework that emphasizes the interdependencies and beneﬁts\
    \ of\nintegration. To achieve the research aim, an in-depth analysis of relevant\
    \ research studies,\ncase studies, best practices, and expert opinions was employed.\

    \ Building\nThe concept of a smart building has gained signiﬁcant attention in\
    \ the context of\ncreating sustainable, energy-efﬁcient, and intelligent built\
    \ environments.\nSmart buildings possess several key features that set them apart\
    \ from traditional build-\nings. Firstly, they incorporate automated systems for\
    \ environmental control, including\nheating, ventilation, air conditioning (HVAC),\
    \ lighting, and shading. These systems use\nreal-time data from sensors to adjust\
    \ settings based on occupancy, weather conditions, and\nenergy consumption patterns,\
    \ leading to energy efﬁciency and enhanced occupant com-\nfort [16]. Secondly,\
    \ smart buildings employ advanced building management systems (BMS)\nthat integrate\
    \ various subsystems and devices into a centralized platform. This allows for\n\
    centralized monitoring, control, and analysis of building operations, leading\
    \ to improved\noperational efﬁciency, predictive maintenance, and proactive decision\
    \ making [17].\nMoreover, smart buildings leverage data analytics and machine\
    \ learning algorithms\nto derive insights from collected data. By analyzing patterns,\
    \ trends, and anomalies, these\nbuildings can optimize resource utilization, identify\
    \ energy-saving opportunities, and\nanticipate maintenance needs [18]. The use\
    \ of data-driven insights enables continuous\nimprovement and adaptability within\
    \ smart buildings. The development of smart buildings\nis driven by various technological\
    \ advancements. Firstly, the proliferation of sensing\ntechnologies and IoT devices\
    \ has made it possible to collect real-time data on building\nperformance, occupancy,\
    \ and environmental conditions. These sensors provide valuable\ninputs for monitoring,\
    \ control, and optimization strategies [19].\nFurthermore, advancements in data\
    \ analytics and cloud computing enable the process-\ning and storage of vast amounts\
    \ of data generated by smart buildings. Machine learning\nalgorithms can analyze\
    \ this data to extract meaningful insights and support decision-\nmaking processes\
    \ [20]. Cloud-based platforms also enable remote access, monitoring, and\ncontrol\
    \ of smart building systems, enhancing operational ﬂexibility and scalability\
    \ [21].\nAdditionally, the emergence of edge computing and wireless communication\
    \ technologies\nfacilitates real-time data processing and reduces latency in smart\
    \ building applications [22].\nEdge devices, such as edge servers and gateways,\
    \ enable local data processing and analysis,\nenhancing the responsiveness and\
    \ efﬁciency of smart building systems.\nSmart buildings intelligently control\
    \ internal environments by integrating building\nsystems on a single network and\
    \ adapting characteristics of construction materials and\nfaçade elements to changing\
    \ usage and weather conditions. Furthermore, a crucial feature\nof a smart building\
    \ is the provision of building services that optimize occupant productivity\n\
    while simultaneously reducing costs and minimizing environmental impact. Technological\n\
    advancements in regulating the interior environment have led to the emergence\
    \ of smart\nbuildings as responsive and controlled environments for inhabitants,\
    \ companies, and\nsociety [23]. The objective of smart buildings is to achieve\
    \ a state of self-management,\nlearning, prediction, and adaptation without requiring\
    \ any intervention or awareness\nfrom their occupants. Sensors and monitors can\
    \ expeditiously and autonomously modify\nambient temperatures, illumination, shading,\
    \ energy efﬁciency, and water usage. One of\nthe applications of the IoT in urban\
    \ contexts is the utilization of ICT to enhance the quality\nof life for occupants\
    \ in smart building environments [24].\n2.2. Smart Building Evaluation Frameworks\n\
    Smart buildings are designed to meet speciﬁc requirements and follow established\n\
    frameworks that guide their development and operation. One of the primary requirements\n\
    for smart buildings is energy efﬁciency. Energy consumption in buildings accounts\
    \ for\na signiﬁcant portion of global energy use, making energy efﬁciency a crucial\
    \ consider-\nation in smart building design [8]. Energy-efﬁcient systems, such\
    \ as high-performance\nSmart Cities 2023, 6\n1835\nHVAC systems, advanced lighting\
    \ controls, and smart metering, are integrated into smart\nbuildings to minimize\
    \ energy consumption and reduce environmental impact [25]. Energy\nperformance\
    \ certiﬁcation (EPC) is a system that rates the energy efﬁciency of buildings.\n\
    Smart building is considered to compile the features of a sustainable building\
    \ as\nwell [15]. In this regard, BREEAM, LEED, DGNB, and other national-level\
    \ frameworks\nare established to guide the design, implementation, and evaluation\
    \ of sustainable build-\nings. The European Commission recently launched LEVEL(s),\
    \ a framework for sustainable\nbuildings that connects the speciﬁc performance\
    \ of the building to European policy objec-\ntives [26].\nAutomation is another\
    \ essential aspect of smart building requirements. Automation\nalso enables the\
    \ implementation of advanced features like adaptive lighting, predictive\nmaintenance,\
    \ and demand response [27]. Building management systems (BMS) and build-\ning\
    \ automation and control systems (BACS) are used for the integration and interoperability\n\
    of various building systems, including HVAC, lighting, security, and ﬁre safety\
    \ [28]. The\nBMS focuses on centralized monitoring, control, and optimization,\
    \ enabling the seamless\noperation of these systems within smart buildings.\n\
    In relation to automation and BMS, some frameworks were developed to assess the\n\
    smartness of buildings, including, for example, the smart readiness indicator\
    \ (SRI) and\nSPIRE. The SRI framework was introduced by the European Commission\
    \ in 2018 and\nused to assess the preparedness of buildings for smart technologies\
    \ [29]. It consists of\nthree pillars: systems integration, real-time data, and\
    \ human-centered design. The SRI\nframework is an extensive methodology for determining\
    \ a building’s readiness to exploit\nsmart technologies. The SPIRE program, which\
    \ has been created by UL Solutions (a\nglobal leader in applied safety science),\
    \ is a certiﬁcation initiative that centers on the\nkey aspects of sustainability,\
    \ performance, innovation, reliability, and user-friendliness in\nthe context\
    \ of smart buildings. The SPIRE technology is instrumental in promoting the\n\
    development of intelligent buildings and safeguarding their advantages for proprietors\n\
    and the ecosystem [30].\nData analytics plays a signiﬁcant role in smart building\
    \ frameworks. By collecting and\nanalyzing data from sensors, meters, and other\
    \ sources, smart buildings can derive valuable\ninsights to improve performance\
    \ and optimize operations. Data analytics techniques,\nincluding machine learning\
    \ and artiﬁcial intelligence, enable advanced functionalities\nsuch as anomaly\
    \ detection, fault diagnostics, and predictive analytics [20]. These insights\n\
    facilitate data-driven decision making and enable proactive maintenance, resulting\
    \ in\nimproved energy efﬁciency and reduced operational costs. Thus, by employing\
    \ data\nanalytics, digital twin platforms have emerged as powerful tools in the\
    \ context of smart\nbuilding frameworks.\nA digital twin is a virtual replica\
    \ of a physical building that is continuously updated\nwith real-time data from\
    \ sensors and other sources. The presented frameworks emphasize\ndifferent DT\
    \ maturity levels of the smart building management and control strategies in-\n\
    cluding reactive strategy (most buildings’ status), real-time based on IoT driven,\
    \ predictive\nstrategy, and proactive strategy [31]. However, certain challenges\
    \ might be faced in adopt-\ning digital twin platforms. First, the implementation\
    \ of digital twin technology requires a\nsigniﬁcant investment in sensor deployment\
    \ and data infrastructure. Additionally, data\nprivacy and security concerns must\
    \ be addressed when collecting and analyzing sensitive\nbuilding data. Safeguarding\
    \ the privacy of occupants and protecting the building’s systems\nfrom cyber threats\
    \ are critical considerations in the adoption of digital twin platforms [32].\n\
    Despite these challenges, the integration of digital twin (DT) platforms with\
    \ data analytics\nholds great potential for optimizing the performance and operations\
    \ of smart buildings, it\nis expected that digital twin platforms will play an\
    \ increasingly signiﬁcant role in shaping\nthe future of smart building frameworks.\n\
    As it was presented above, various assessment schemes might be applicable to evaluate\n\
    certain aspects of smart buildings. However, there is a huge challenge to combine\
    \ all these\naspects into one single framework.\nSmart Cities 2023, 6\n1836\n\
    3. Smart City\n3.1. Concept of Smart City\nThe concept of a smart city has undergone\
    \ signiﬁcant development and has garnered\nattention in both academic and practical\
    \ spheres. Over the years, various deﬁnitions\nand characteristics have been proposed\
    \ to capture the essence of a smart city. Table 1\nprovides a compilation of several\
    \ studies that conceptualize the smart city deﬁnition\nfrom a functional point\

    \ city emphasizes the ability to act proactively and\nadapt to changing circumstances\
    \ [34]. It embraces advanced technologies such as artiﬁcial\nintelligence (AI)\
    \ [42], data analytics, and automation to enable intelligent systems and\nservices.\
    \ The adaptive nature of smart city services, ICT systems, infrastructure, and\n\
    buildings is crucial for providing customized, efﬁcient, and responsive solutions\
    \ to the\nneeds of citizens [35,36].\nThe overarching goal of a smart city paradigm\
    \ is to achieve contemporary urban gov-\nernance by utilizing advanced technical\
    \ instruments and cutting-edge technologies while\nconsidering ecological norms\
    \ and optimizing resource consumption [40]. The integration\nof digital technologies,\
    \ data-driven solutions, and sustainable practices remains at the core\nof smart\
    \ city development. By leveraging these elements, smart cities strive to enhance\n\
    the quality of life, improve efﬁciency in urban operations, and create sustainable\
    \ urban\nenvironments for their residents.\nThe integration of smart and resilient\
    \ city concepts holds great potential for enhancing\nresiliency in numerous ways\
    \ [43]. Smart cities leverage technology to gather and analyze\ndata, which can\
    \ be utilized to identify and mitigate risks. With the large amount of\ndata acquired\
    \ by smart cities, data-driven decision making becomes possible, enabling\nproactive\
    \ risk assessment and resource allocation. Collaboration is essential for efﬁcient\n\
    solution development and implementation among smart and resilient cities, as well\
    \ as with\nvarious stakeholders such as enterprises, academics, and the general\
    \ public. Furthermore,\ninnovation is critical in embracing new technology and\
    \ techniques to handle shifting\ndifﬁculties [44].\n3.2. Role of Digitalization\
    \ in Smart Cities\nDigitalization plays a pivotal role in the development of smart\
    \ cities, revolutionizing\nurban infrastructure and services through the integration\
    \ of digital technologies and con-\nnectivity. This section highlights the importance\
    \ of digitalization and its inﬂuence on urban\ninfrastructure and services in\
    \ the context of smart city development [45].\nThe conventional city system consists\
    \ of two primary layers, namely the infrastructure\nand services layers. The infrastructure\
    \ layer pertains to the tangible constituents of the\nsystem and furnishes fundamental\
    \ services that are integrated within the urban regions. It\nis regarded as the\
    \ intermediary between the city residents and natural resources, thereby\nlaying\
    \ the groundwork for all the crucial aspects associated with the city, such as\
    \ individ-\nuals, ediﬁces, mobility, economy, governance, energy, water, and environment\
    \ [46]. The\nservices layer, commonly known as the “business layer,” is constructed\
    \ on a foundation\nof infrastructure and encompasses a range of activities that\
    \ support the inhabitants of a\ncity. These activities include municipal tasks\
    \ such as water supply, waste management,\nenvironmental management, and energy\
    \ distribution, among others [46]. The fundamental\naspect that can successfully\
    \ transform a City 1.0 into a City 2.0, commonly referred to as a\nsmart city,\
    \ is the incorporation of a data layer, also known as the digital layer.\nThe\
    \ process of digitalization has facilitated the development of intelligent infras-\n\
    tructure and urban areas. The digitization of physical space and energy, information\n\
    transmission, user and asset management, and business operations has been a gradual\n\
    process [45]. The timely capture and sharing of information are crucial value\
    \ propositions\nof ICT in the context of a smart city. Provided that the information\
    \ is delivered promptly\nand with precision, urban areas have the potential to\
    \ proactively address issues before they\nreach a critical level. According to\
    \ a scholarly source, a method of conceptualizing digital\ninfrastructure is through\
    \ the utilization of various digital layers that provide support, as\nshown in\
    \ Table 2.\nSmart Cities 2023, 6\n1838\nTable 2. Digital layers of the smart city.\n\

    \ cities by enabling the collection, analysis, and use of\nreal-time data to improve\
    \ urban services and infrastructure [50]. This includes the integra-\ntion of\
    \ IoT devices and sensors [24], enhanced connectivity and communication, and the\n\
    development of intelligent systems and platforms. In the energy sector, digital\
    \ technologies\nare being used to integrate renewable energy sources, demand response\
    \ mechanisms, and\nsmart metering systems. This leads to energy efﬁciency and\
    \ sustainability. In the trans-\nportation sector, digitalization facilitates\
    \ the development of intelligent trafﬁc management\nsystems, electric vehicle\
    \ charging infrastructure, and ride-sharing platforms [51]. This\npromotes efﬁcient\
    \ and sustainable mobility. Digitalization is also enhancing urban services\n\
    such as waste management, water management, and public safety. Smart waste manage-\n\
    ment systems, digitalized water management systems, and smart security systems\
    \ are all\nbeing developed to improve these services. Overall, digitalization\
    \ has a positive impact on\nsmart cities by making them more efﬁcient [52], sustainable\
    \ [14], and resilient [43].\n3.3. Impact of Digitalization on Smart City Infrastructure\n\

    \ enables collective optimization, where\nsmart buildings work together as a system\
    \ to achieve shared goals, such as load balancing,\ndemand response, and environmental\
    \ impact reduction [11,59].\n4.2. Importance of Integration for Efﬁciency, Resilience,\
    \ and Sustainability of City Performance\nThe integration of smart buildings into\
    \ smart cities is crucial for achieving efﬁciency,\nresilience, and sustainability\
    \ in city performance.\nEfﬁciency refers to the use of technology and data-driven\
    \ solutions to improve the\nperformance and quality of municipal services while\
    \ consuming fewer resources and\nspending less money. By integrating energy-efﬁcient\
    \ systems, smart meters, and advanced\ncontrol algorithms, smart buildings contribute\
    \ to overall energy savings and reduced\nenvironmental impact [60]. The integration\
    \ allows for coordinated energy management\nstrategies, such as load shifting,\
    \ peak shaving, and renewable energy utilization [61],\nleading to enhanced energy\
    \ efﬁciency and reduced greenhouse gas emissions [62].\nFurthermore, integration\
    \ enables resource optimization by leveraging the intercon-\nnectedness of smart\
    \ buildings with other urban systems. The integration of smart buildings\nwith\
    \ smart grids facilitates demand response initiatives, whereby buildings adapt\
    \ their\nenergy usage in response to grid conditions and pricing cues [17]. This\
    \ collaboration\nbetween buildings and the grid leads to more efﬁcient energy\
    \ distribution, reduced strain\non the grid, and enhanced overall system reliability.\n\
    Within the framework of integrating the smart building into a smart city, environmen-\n\
    tal sustainability is another important metric in this scenario. It involves the\
    \ implementation\nof an energy-efﬁcient system such as renewable energy, advanced\
    \ control algorithms, ICT,\nand smart meters to curtail energy usage and mitigate\
    \ environmental impact [63]. Integra-\ntion also facilitates the optimization\
    \ of water management and waste management within\nsmart cities. Smart buildings\
    \ can incorporate water-efﬁcient technologies, such as smart\nirrigation [64],\
    \ rainwater harvesting systems, and greywater recycling [65] contributing to\n\
    water conservation at the city level [49]. In waste management, integration enables\
    \ real-\ntime monitoring of waste generation, optimized waste collection routes\
    \ [57], and improved\nrecycling practices, leading to efﬁcient waste management\
    \ and reduced environmental\nimpact [66].\nIn contrast, resilience usually refers\
    \ to the capacity of a system to withstand and recover\nfrom unexpected disturbances\
    \ and pressures while preserving its operational and adaptive\ncapabilities. The\
    \ concept of resilience in the realm of smart cities and buildings pertains to\n\
    the development of structures and urban infrastructures that possess the ability\
    \ to forecast,\nadapt, adjust to, and recuperate from disruptive occurrences [67].\
    \ The integration of\nsmart buildings into smart cities in a resilient manner\
    \ involves implementing strategies to\nstrengthen infrastructure durability, enhance\
    \ emergency response mechanisms, and foster\ncommunity resilience, as indicated\
    \ in [43]. The integration of resilient characteristics in\nsmart buildings can\
    \ effectively enhance the overall resilience of urban areas by minimizing\nthe\
    \ adverse effects of various disruptions, including but not limited to natural\
    \ calamities,\nclimate change, and system breakdowns. The integration in question\
    \ allows for the prompt\nmonitoring of multiple parameters in real time, thereby\
    \ enabling swift responses and\nadaptable measures in emergency situations [68].\n\
    To improve efﬁciency, resilience, and sustainability in city performance, smart\
    \ build-\nings need to be integrated into smart cities. The connectivity of smart\
    \ buildings with\nother urban systems allows for coordinated energy management\
    \ techniques, which in turn\nleads to increased energy efﬁciency, decreased greenhouse\
    \ gas emissions, and resource\noptimization. Energy conservation is achieved through\
    \ the incorporation of water-efﬁcient\ntechnologies and optimized waste management\
    \ practices, while environmental impact\nis lessened by reducing energy consumption\
    \ and using renewable energy sources and\ncutting-edge control algorithms and\
    \ smart meters. Finally, smart cities aim to improve\nSmart Cities 2023, 6\n1842\n\
    infrastructure longevity, and emergency response mechanisms by integrating security\n\
    systems, and community resilience through the incorporation of smart buildings.\n\
    4.3. Enhanced Urban Living through Smart Services\nThe integration of smart buildings\
    \ into smart cities ultimately aims to enhance urban\nliving experiences. By integrating\
    \ technologies such as Internet of things (IoT) devices, data\nanalytics, and\
    \ personalized services, smart buildings can provide tailored and responsive\n\
    experiences to occupants [59]. This includes adaptive lighting, personalized comfort\n\
    settings, and optimized indoor environmental quality [27]. Integration also enables\
    \ smart\nbuilding services to extend beyond individual buildings, such as smart\
    \ parking, shared\nmobility, and intelligent community services.\nThe implementation\
    \ of ubiquitous computing technology relies on the integration\nand organized\
    \ interconnection of smart service systems that oversee the administration of\n\
    ediﬁces and urban areas [20,40], as well as their engagement with users. The initial\
    \ phase\ninvolved establishing and implementing the IoT [3], which involved linking\
    \ household\nappliances to the network and facilitating communication with the\
    \ building or municipal\ninfrastructure [2], as well as with the user. Subsequently,\
    \ a methodical approach involves the\ninstallation of diverse sensors and devices\
    \ within buildings [59]. This, in conjunction with\nthe IoT, facilitates the gathering,\
    \ transmission, analysis, and reaction to the accumulated\ndata and additional\
    \ engagement with occupants.\nThe optimization of city infrastructure systems,\
    \ including energy, water, and trafﬁc,\nis a signiﬁcant advantage of urban intelligent\
    \ systems and smart building networking.\nUntil recently, the capabilities of\
    \ integration and system interaction have been restricted\nto data transfer technologies.\
    \ However, the emergence of the 5G network has altered\nthis landscape, as its\
    \ data transfer rate is now sufﬁcient to support the implementation of\nautonomous\
    \ vehicle transport and other advanced applications. It is anticipated that the\n\
    current speed standard will be augmented in the near future, thereby facilitating\
    \ additional\nadvancement and interactivity of said systems.\nIt is imperative\
    \ to acknowledge the wider societal and technological ramiﬁcations\nof IoT advancement,\
    \ while also prioritizing the interdependent connection between the\nintelligent\
    \ frameworks of smart cities and smart buildings. The investigation of these\n\
    effects is currently underway in numerous ﬁelds. However, it is important to acknowledge\n\
    that the optimal implementation of such projects requires the synergy of urban\
    \ systems,\nincluding infrastructure, transportation, and administration.\n5.\
    \ Factors Affecting Smart Building Integration into Smart City\nThis part of the\
    \ paper synthesizes the ﬁndings and provides a comprehensive analysis\nof the\
    \ factors inﬂuencing smart building integration into smart cities taking into\
    \ account\nthe technological aspects of the city. Given the multitude of factors\
    \ identiﬁed, the study\nconducted a synthesis to organize and categorize them\
    \ based on thematic areas. This\ncategorization led to the identiﬁcation of ﬁve\
    \ main infrastructure areas: smart energy, smart\nmobility, smart water, smart\
    \ security systems, and smart waste management. Each of these\nthematic areas\
    \ is described in detail in the subsequent subsections. By categorizing the\n\
    factors according to their respective infrastructure, it aimed to provide a comprehensive\n\
    understanding of the different aspects that contribute to the integration of smart\
    \ build-\nings into smart cities. The detailed descriptions of each thematic area\
    \ enabled a deeper\nexploration and analysis of the factors involved in each domain.\n\
    5.1. Factors Related to Smart Energy\nThe smart energy services of a smart building\
    \ are essential for all aspects of both smart\nbuildings and shaping the overall\
    \ performance and sustainability of the smart city, from\npowering homes and businesses\
    \ to providing transportation and lighting. For example, the\nintegration of energy\
    \ storage systems such as batteries of advanced storage technologies in\nsmart\
    \ buildings enhances energy management capabilities [69], which enables the capture\n\
    Smart Cities 2023, 6\n1843\nand utilization of surplus energy generated by renewable\
    \ sources [61], allowing for better\ndemand response management, load balancing,\
    \ and peak shaving. Smart buildings serve\nas key nodes in the integration of\
    \ smart grids, enabling bidirectional communication and\ndynamic energy management\
    \ [8]. Therefore, the impact of smart energy solutions in smart\nbuildings is\
    \ substantial in smart cities as well. Through renewable energy adoption, energy\n\
    efﬁciency measures, energy storage, sharing thermal energy, and integration with\
    \ smart\ngrids, smart buildings contribute to the overall sustainability, resilience,\
    \ and efﬁciency of\nsmart cities. By embracing these technologies and approaches,\
    \ smart cities can achieve a\nmore sustainable, clean, and reliable energy future\
    \ while optimizing resource utilization\nand reducing carbon emissions Table 3\
    \ provides speciﬁcs on the smart building’s energy\nservices and how they work.\n\

    \ another critical aspect in the context of smart buildings and smart cities,\n\
    it plays a crucial role in enhancing transportation efﬁciency, reducing congestion,\
    \ and\nimproving the overall quality of life. By examining the importance of the\
    \ factors presented\nin Table 4. and their contribution to the performance of\
    \ the city, it could be stated that\nelectric vehicles (EVs) and EV charging points\
    \ contribute to reducing dependence on fossil\nfuels and decreasing carbon emissions\
    \ [79]. Carpooling and ride-sharing services enable\nmultiple individuals to share\
    \ a single vehicle and reduce the number of cars, these services\ncan be facilitated\
    \ through digital platforms that connect passengers and drivers, optimizing\n\
    routes and enhancing transportation efﬁciency [51]. Modern parking solutions such\
    \ as\nshared parking and online video surveillance normally comprise inter alia\
    \ network of\nSmart Cities 2023, 6\n1844\nsensors, real-time data, and a global\
    \ positioning system to provide information on parking\navailability, and guide\
    \ drivers to vacant parking spaces efﬁciently [80].\nTable 4. Factors enabling\

    It is a transportation solution to address the ﬁnal\njourney from a transportation\
    \ hub to the ﬁnal\ndestination point by using self-driving vehicles.\n[82]\nTherefore,\

    ating smart mobility strategies, and more sustainable and efﬁcient transportation\
    \ systems\nin cities through improved trafﬁc ﬂow, reduced congestion, and enhanced\
    \ overall mobility\nexperience for residents and visitors.\n5.3. Factors Related\
    \ to Smart Water\nSmart water solutions play a crucial role in enhancing the sustainability\
    \ and efﬁciency\nof smart buildings and their impact extends to the overall performance\
    \ of smart cities.\nImplementing smart water solutions in the smart building shown\
    \ in Table 5., such as\nwater conservation measures, real-time monitoring, leak\
    \ detection systems, and smart\nirrigation contribute to optimized water usage,\
    \ reduced wastage, and ensured water\navailability for both residents and businesses.\
    \ They also support sustainable development\nby mitigating the strain on water\
    \ resources, enhancing resilience to water-related challenges,\nand promoting\
    \ more efﬁcient use of water in buildings and urban areas. By integrating\nthese\
    \ smart water technologies, cities can move towards a more sustainable and water-\n\
    resilient future.\nTable 5. Factors enabling smart water services.\nFactors\n\

    \ security system is a top-priority integral component for a smart building\n\
    and a city [88]. Smart buildings are tapping into the IoT to enable more applications\
    \ to\nconnect, and that includes physical security solutions presented in Table\
    \ 6, such as video\nsurveillance, ﬁre detection, disaster event communication,\
    \ and smart security lights. In a\nsmart building, video surveillance solutions\
    \ can identify potential risks, such as a person of\ninterest in a parking lot\
    \ [89], track that person, and report ﬁndings back to a security team,\nall in\
    \ real time. These technologies enable better monitoring, detection, and response\
    \ to\nﬁre [90], resulting in improved safety measures and performance within a\
    \ city, enabling\nearly detection, enhancing incident command centers, improving\
    \ ﬁre suppression methods,\nand providing situational awareness to ﬁreﬁghters.\
    \ All these solutions have a signiﬁcant\nimpact on a city’s performance by increasing\
    \ safety, minimizing damage, and facilitating\nefﬁcient emergency response. In\
    \ the same scenario, IoT devices are utilized to collect data\nand aid in the\
    \ identiﬁcation of alarms following disasters as well as the localization of\n\
    injured persons [90].\nTable 6. Factors enabling smart security services.\nFactors\n\

    \ to Smart Waste Management\nWaste management often entails waste monitoring,\
    \ collection, transportation, process-\ning, recycling, and disposal. Smart waste\
    \ management systems aid in waste reduction by\nSmart Cities 2023, 6\n1846\ncategorizing\
    \ garbage at the source and developing ways for proper waste disposal. Such\n\
    systems could be used to recycle garbage and establish closed-loop economies.\
    \ Their key\nadvantages are improved garbage collection, pick up, separation,\
    \ reuse, and recycling\nefﬁciency. One of the most signiﬁcant inefﬁciencies in\
    \ trash management is the inability to\npredict when waste will be collected;\
    \ trucks are frequently dispatched to collect rubbish\nwhen bins are not full.\
    \ Sensors, connection, and the Internet of things (IoT) provide strate-\ngies\
    \ to avoid additional expenses associated with such inefﬁciencies, where a smart\
    \ bin\nand automated waste collection smart waste management systems monitor the\
    \ movement\nof various types of garbage, and technology can be used to better\
    \ understand and manage\nthe ﬂow of waste from source to disposal [6]. Table 7\

    6. Case Studies of Successful Smart Buildings Integration into Smart Cities\n\
    6.1. Introduction to Case Studies\nFive case studies from different geographical\
    \ locations were selected to highlight\nsuccessful smart building projects that\
    \ demonstrate fulﬁlled integration requirements\nbased on the smart infrastructure\
    \ development of the city.\nThe Edge is a highly intelligent and ecologically\
    \ efﬁcient building located in the\nNetherlands, in Amsterdam’s Zuidas business\
    \ sector. It received a 98.4% rating on the\nBREEAM scale in 2015 [99], the highest\
    \ ever recorded. Deloitte occupies the 40,000-square-\nfoot ofﬁce building. Advanced\
    \ sensor systems, lighting control systems, rainwater reuse,\nsmart HVAC systems,\
    \ thermal energy storage systems, and a central building management\nsystem (BMS)\
    \ for real-time monitoring are all part of the building’s design. The Edge\ncombines\
    \ several technologies, such as IoT connection, a cloud-based analytics platform,\n\
    intelligent meters, and real-time energy monitoring. It also emphasizes the signiﬁcance\
    \ of\nongoing feedback and occupant participation to increase comfort and satisfaction.\
    \ By part-\nnering with local community partners, the building’s design also promotes\
    \ environmental\nmeasures [100,101].\nOne Angel Square, a Manchester-based smart\
    \ building in the UK, aims to create a\nsustainable and energy-efﬁcient working\
    \ environment for its occupants [102]. The building\nincorporates intelligent\
    \ lighting systems, a combined heat and power plant, and heat\nrecovery systems\
    \ for heating and cooling [103]. It also utilizes building automation, control\n\
    systems, energy management software, and renewable energy sources like rooftop\
    \ solar\npanels. The building’s design incorporates social and stakeholder engagement\
    \ strategies,\ninvolving occupants and local community stakeholders. One Angel\
    \ Square has achieved\nBREEAM outstanding certiﬁcation for sustainability [104],\
    \ reducing energy consumption by\nover 50% compared to previous ofﬁce buildings.\
    \ This achievement showcases the successful\nintegration of smart technologies,\
    \ energy-efﬁcient systems, and stakeholder engagement in\ncreating a highly sustainable\
    \ and environmentally friendly ofﬁce building [105].\nThe National University\
    \ of Singapore (NUS) was designated as the Green Mark\nPlatinum Champion for its\
    \ outstanding role in sustainable development, successfully\nobtaining a 50 Green\
    \ Mark certiﬁcate and being awarded Zero Energy winner for its\ncampuses [106].\
    \ The bestowed recognition is conferred upon structures that have been\nSmart\
    \ Cities 2023, 6\n1847\ncertiﬁed for their achievement in attaining either zero\
    \ energy consumption or exceptionally\nlow energy consumption levels. The university\
    \ has set a goal of achieving carbon neutrality\non its campus by the year 2030\
    \ [107]. In addition, it has implemented a smart building\nintegration program\
    \ to improve energy efﬁciency, occupant comfort, and operational\nefﬁciency. The\
    \ program includes smart lighting systems with occupancy and daylight\nsensors,\
    \ personalized HVAC systems, and an integrated building management system\n(iBMS).\
    \ Real-time energy monitoring and analytics are employed to provide insights into\n\
    energy consumption patterns and facilitate targeted energy-saving strategies.\
    \ This has led\nto signiﬁcant reductions in energy consumption and carbon emissions,\
    \ improved occupant\ncomfort and productivity, and the successful implementation\
    \ of demand response strategies\nfor peak load management [108].\nOngos Valley,\
    \ a smart building development in Windhoek, Namibia, focuses on\nsustainable design\
    \ and advanced technologies to create an environmentally friendly com-\nmunity.\
    \ By integrating renewable energy sources and implementing efﬁcient water man-\n\
    agement practices, the project reduces dependence on traditional energy sources\
    \ and\nachieves a lower carbon footprint [109]. Ongos Valley prioritizes residents’\
    \ quality of life\nand well-being, promoting a comfortable and sustainable living\
    \ environment [110]. The\nproject emphasizes collaborative partnerships with local\
    \ stakeholders, fostering a collective\napproach to project success and long-term\
    \ sustainability [111].\nReliance MET City, a large-scale development near Gurgaon,\
    \ India, focuses on sustain-\nable urban living by integrating smart building\
    \ systems and reducing energy consumption\nand carbon emissions. It prioritizes\
    \ waste management and recycling practices to promote\nenvironmental sustainability\
    \ [112]. MET City aims to improve the quality of life and livabil-\nity of residents,\
    \ offering a comfortable and advanced urban environment [113]. Reliance\nMET City,\
    \ a subsidiary of Reliance Industries Limited, is developing state-of-the-art\
    \ in-\nfrastructure and amenities, offering a ‘walk to work’ advantage to residents.\
    \ With rapid\ngrowth, the city has become a hub for economic development, attracting\
    \ companies and\nresidential customers [114].\n6.2. Case Study Analysis and Results\n\
    Table 8 presents a summary of the above-mentioned case studies analysis showcasing\n\
    successful smart building integration into smart cities. It provides information\
    \ about key\nintegration factors addressed in the previous chapter of this paper.\n\
    The graphical representation of the technological factors enabling smart services\n\
    implemented in each case study is presented in Figure 3. All of the indicators\
    \ from the list of\n26 were proven. In the energy sector, European cities, particularly\
    \ Amsterdam, demonstrate\na strong focus on sustainability and resilience [115],\
    \ which involves the implementation\nof an energy-efﬁcient system and the ability\
    \ to adapt to disruptive occurrences, such\nas renewable energy, energy storage\
    \ advanced control algorithms, and ICT to curtail\nenergy usage and mitigate environmental\
    \ impact. They lead in energy storage and off-\ngrid potential, indicating a commitment\
    \ to integrating renewable energy sources and\nenhancing energy management. According\
    \ to Figure 3, The Edge in Amsterdam has 5 out\nof 7 services integrated to address\
    \ their smart city goals in the context of energy storage\nand implementing renewable\
    \ energy sources. On the other hand, Asian cities prioritize\nsmart EV infrastructure,\
    \ reﬂecting their goals of promoting electric transportation and\naddressing concerns\
    \ related to rapid motorization. This regional variation highlights the\ndifferent\
    \ approaches taken toward energy transition and sustainability [116]. Two Asian\n\
    projects, i.e., Reliance MET, Gurgaon, India and (NUS) smart buildings, Singapore,\
    \ have\nenergy services 4 and 3 out of 7, respectively.\nWhen it comes to mobility,\
    \ all analyzed case studies are developed to promote smart\nand sustainable mobility.\
    \ European cities stand out in promoting shared mobility services\nand reducing\
    \ private car usage [117]. Both The Edge in Amsterdam and One Angle Square\nin\
    \ the UK integrated 5 mobility services out of 6. This emphasizes their commitment\
    \ to\nsustainable transportation solutions, reducing trafﬁc congestion, and enhancing\
    \ last-mile\nSmart Cities 2023, 6\n1848\nconnectivity. Asian cities (NUS, Singapore—5\
    \ out of 6 services; Reliance MET, Gurgaon,\nIndia—4 out of 6 services) address\
    \ the challenges of rapid urbanization by placing a stronger\nemphasis on promoting\
    \ sharing mobility, video surveillance, and parking management,\nindicating concerns\
    \ related to motorization and the need for efﬁcient parking solutions [116].\n\
    African cities lag behind in smart mobility, likely due to cost constraints and\
    \ infrastructure\nchallenges they face in implementing advanced mobility systems.\n\

    \ electric transportation and address-\ning concerns related to rapid motorization.\
    \ This regional variation highlights the diﬀerent \napproaches taken toward energy\
    \ transition and sustainability [116]. Two Asian projects, \ni.e., Reliance MET,\
    \ Gurgaon, India and (NUS) smart buildings, Singapore, have energy \nservices\
    \ 4 and 3 out of 7, respectively. \n \nFigure 3. Case studies: key factors related\

    \ Case studies: key factors related to smart services of different smart cities\
    \ domains.\nIn water and waste management, regional patterns are evident. Water\
    \ conservation\nand recycling initiatives are more prevalent in regions with water\
    \ scarcity, such as in Africa\nand India (4 out of 6 water services). Singapore\
    \ stands out for its comprehensive smart\nSmart Cities 2023, 6\n1850\nwater management\
    \ initiatives, emphasizing the importance of efﬁcient water use in a water-\n\
    stressed environment [118]. In waste management, European cities lead in automation,\n\
    sensors, and data analytics, reﬂecting their focus on achieving greater efﬁciency\
    \ and\nsustainability goals [49]. Other regions primarily utilize basic smart\
    \ bins due to a lack of\nadequate infrastructure, suggesting the potential for\
    \ further development and utilization\nof waste data.\nThe security domain demonstrates\
    \ high development status within the selected case\nstudies: The Edge, Amsterdam\
    \ and Ongos Valley, Windhoek have security as a ﬁrst priority\n(5 out of 5) while\
    \ the rest of the projects have implemented 4 smart services out of 5. This\n\
    shows that the enhanced smart city initiatives provide the overall measurements\
    \ to increase\nnot only the efﬁciency and sustainability but the resilience of\
    \ smart city performance,\nincluding safety and security services for their inhabitants\
    \ as well.\nBased on the analysis of case studies, several recommendations can\
    \ be made to\nenhance the technological aspects of smart city initiatives. Firstly,\
    \ there is a need to\nexpand renewable energy and storage solutions to increase\
    \ self-sufﬁciency and resilience\nagainst grid disruptions. Technologies such\
    \ as vehicle-to-grid systems and energy trading\nplatforms can facilitate the\
    \ integration of mobility and energy sectors. Furthermore, scaling\nsustainable\
    \ mobility options like shared vehicles, e-buses, and demand-responsive transit\n\
    can improve convenience and reduce congestion. Integration of payment and scheduling\n\
    systems across different modes of transport will enhance usability. Additionally,\
    \ expanding\nenvironmental monitoring by leveraging low-cost sensors can provide\
    \ hyperlocal data\non air and water quality, which can inform evidence-based policies.\
    \ It is also essential\nto invest in cybersecurity measures and develop robust\
    \ data governance frameworks to\naddress privacy concerns and build public trust.\
    \ Finally, pursuing regional partnerships\nand knowledge exchange with other cities\
    \ can facilitate the replication of successful use\ncases and accelerate smart\
    \ city development. Collaborative efforts and a shared vision\nacross sectors\
    \ and stakeholders are essential for the realization of integrated, inclusive,\
    \ and\nsustainable smart cities. By learning from best practices and focusing\
    \ on local priorities,\ncities can drive the realization of technologically optimized\
    \ urban living in a way that best\nserves their communities.\n7. Discussion\n\
    In this chapter, the identiﬁed factors, their interrelationships, and their implications\n\
    for successful integration are discussed. Additionally, common challenges, limitations,\
    \ and\nareas for further research are identiﬁed.\nThe study reveals that 26 key\
    \ factors play a crucial role in the integration of smart\nbuildings into smart\
    \ cities. These factors include smart energy, smart mobility, smart water,\nsmart\
    \ security systems, and smart waste management infrastructure domain. Each of\
    \ these\nthematic areas has unique requirements, frameworks, and technologies\
    \ that contribute to\nthe overall integration process. Despite the progress made\
    \ in smart building integration\ninto smart cities, some common challenges need\
    \ to be addressed. These include data inter-\noperability, privacy and security\
    \ concerns, regulatory barriers, technological complexities,\nand the need for\
    \ scalable and cost-effective solutions.\nIn the context of smart energy integration,\
    \ the adoption of energy-efﬁcient systems,\nrenewable energy integration, and\
    \ demand-side management are essential. However,\nchallenges such as the coordination\
    \ of diverse energy resources and the integration of\nenergy storage systems need\
    \ to be addressed to ensure seamless integration and maximize\nenergy optimization.\n\
    Smart mobility integration requires the integration of smart transportation systems,\n\
    electric vehicles, and intelligent trafﬁc management. This integration enables\
    \ congestion\nreduction, emissions reduction, and enhanced mobility. Nevertheless,\
    \ challenges related to\ndata management, interoperability, and infrastructure\
    \ development must be overcome to\nfully realize the beneﬁts of smart mobility\
    \ integration.\nSmart Cities 2023, 6\n1851\nThe integration of smart water management\
    \ solutions enables water conservation and\nreuse, real-time leak detection, and\
    \ quality monitoring. It contributes to efﬁciency and\nsustainability in water\
    \ management. However, challenges related to data privacy, system\ninteroperability,\
    \ and infrastructure investment need to be addressed for successful smart\nwater\
    \ integration.\nSmart security systems, including intelligent surveillance, access\
    \ control, and emer-\ngency response systems, enhance safety, crime prevention,\
    \ and resilience in smart buildings\nand cities. However, privacy concerns, cybersecurity\
    \ threats, and the integration of diverse\nsecurity systems pose challenges to\
    \ effective integration.\nThe application of IoT-based waste monitoring, recycling,\
    \ and waste-to-energy systems\nin smart waste management contributes to efﬁcient\
    \ waste management and supports\ncircular economy goals. E-waste management practices,\
    \ on the other hand, should align\nwith the broader goals of sustainability and\
    \ environmental preservation within smart cities.\nThis can involve the use of\
    \ IoT techniques such as radio frequency (RFID) and sensor\ntechnology to track\
    \ and manage e-waste throughout its lifecycle [66]. However, challenges\nrelated\
    \ to data management, infrastructure, and public engagement need to be addressed\n\
    to achieve effective integration.\nThe integration of smart buildings into smart\
    \ cities raises concerns and potential risks.\nData protection becomes increasingly\
    \ important as smart buildings generate and gather\nmassive volumes of personal\
    \ and sensitive data, raising the danger of data breaches and\nillegal access.\
    \ Another concern is over surveillance, as continual monitoring via integrated\n\
    sensors and surveillance technology might intrude on privacy and personal freedom.\n\
    Furthermore, smart buildings may unintentionally contribute to inequality by raising\
    \ costs\nand posing accessibility issues for low-income populations. Finally,\
    \ an overreliance on\ntechnology in smart buildings may result in interruptions\
    \ and dependencies that disrupt\nvital activities. To address these threats, comprehensive\
    \ approaches such as strong data\nprotection rules, cybersecurity safeguards,\
    \ and fair access programs must be implemented,\nall while protecting privacy\
    \ rights and fostering openness.\nThe scope of this study is related to the technological\
    \ aspects of smart buildings\nintegration into smart cities, and this is the major\
    \ limitation. Additionally, a variety of other\naspects might be further investigated\
    \ in the future such as, for example, the impact of smart\nbuilding integration\
    \ on the social, economic, and environmental aspects of smart cities.\nThe human\
    \ factor (residents or building owners) is one such important factor that needs\n\
    to be carefully analyzed and assessed. The evaluation of long-term sustainability,\
    \ user\nacceptance, and the cost-effectiveness of integrated solutions is essential\
    \ for the successful\nimplementation of smart building integration projects. Adopting\
    \ a human-centric approach\nthat prioritizes equity and accessibility in service\
    \ delivery is also crucial. Citizen feedback\nloops through social media, mobile\
    \ apps, and the Internet of things can enable co-creation\nand ensure that smart\
    \ city initiatives address the needs of all residents. Challenges that\narise\
    \ from technological advances such as electromagnetic radiation of smart buildings\n\
    and smart cities, e-waste, a plethora of under-sea cables, etc., and their impact\
    \ on the\nintegration of smart buildings into a smart city have to be analyzed\
    \ and taken into account\nby decision makers.\nIn summary, advanced digital technologies\
    \ enable the integration of smart buildings\ninto smart cities and new smart services\
    \ provide enormous beneﬁts to the cities and their\ninhabitants. At the same time,\
    \ potential threads caused by certain technologies need to\nbe discussed and leveraged\
    \ in each infrastructure area; thus, additional measures should\nbe implemented\
    \ to minimize the negative effects correspondingly. These decisions are\nwithin\
    \ the responsibility limits of the city planners and smart city strategy development\n\
    authorities who pave the way for new technologies selection and implementation\
    \ to\nintegrate smart buildings into a particular smart city. Thus, further research\
    \ is required to\ndevelop standardized frameworks, guidelines, and best practices\
    \ for successful integration.\nThe next stage to continue this research is to\
    \ present the smart building integration into\nthe smart city evaluation framework\
    \ by considering the identiﬁed technological factors\nSmart Cities 2023, 6\n1852\n\
    and their impact on the efﬁciency, resilience, and environmental sustainability\
    \ of the\ncity’s performance.\n8. Conclusions\nThe presented study researched\
    \ the key factors affecting the smart building integration\ninto the smart city\
    \ considering technological aspects. The established conceptual framework\nrevealed\
    \ three key dimensions of smart building integration into a smart city: physical,\
    \ data,\nand functional. The research revealed that the successful integration\
    \ of smart buildings\ninto smart cities requires attention to multiple factors.\
    \ Through a comprehensive review\nof the relevant literature and case studies\
    \ research, 26 factors inﬂuencing integration in\nﬁve infrastructure areas, namely\
    \ smart energy, smart mobility, smart water, smart security\nsystems, and smart\
    \ waste management, were identiﬁed and discussed. The ﬁndings have\nimportant\
    \ implications for policymakers, urban planners, and stakeholders involved in\n\
    smart city development.\nIn the area of smart energy, the adoption of energy-efﬁcient\
    \ systems, renewable energy\nintegration, and demand-side management are critical\
    \ for achieving energy optimization\nand sustainability. Policymakers and urban\
    \ planners should prioritize the development of\nsupportive regulations, incentives,\
    \ and infrastructure to encourage the implementation of\nthese technologies.\n\
    Smart mobility integration plays a vital role in enhancing transportation efﬁciency\
    \ and\nreducing congestion and CO2 emissions. Policymakers and urban planners\
    \ should focus on\nthe integration of smart transportation systems, the promotion\
    \ of electric vehicles, and the\nimplementation of intelligent trafﬁc management\
    \ strategies. Investments in infrastructure,\nsuch as charging stations and smart\
    \ trafﬁc control systems, are necessary to support the\nwidespread adoption of\
    \ smart mobility solutions.\nSmart water management is essential for achieving\
    \ sustainable water use in smart\ncities. Policymakers and urban planners should\
    \ emphasize the integration of smart water\nmonitoring systems, leak detection\
    \ technologies, and water conservation practices. In-\nvestments in infrastructure\
    \ and the development of data-sharing mechanisms can enable\nefﬁcient water management\
    \ and ensure the long-term sustainability of water resources.\nThe integration\
    \ of smart security systems is crucial for ensuring the safety and re-\nsilience\
    \ of smart buildings and cities. Policymakers and stakeholders should prioritize\
    \ the\nimplementation of intelligent surveillance, access control, and emergency\
    \ response systems.\nIt is also important to address privacy and cybersecurity\
    \ concerns through robust data\nprotection measures and secure communication protocols.\n\
    Smart waste management integration contributes to efﬁcient waste disposal, recycling,\n\
    and resource recovery. Policymakers and urban planners should promote the adoption\
    \ of\nIoT-based waste monitoring systems, encourage recycling initiatives, and\
    \ explore waste-\nto-energy solutions. Public awareness campaigns and incentives\
    \ can encourage active\nparticipation and support the transition toward a circular\
    \ economy.\nThe successful integration of smart buildings into smart cities and\
    \ the identiﬁcation of\nthe sets of integrated smart building services require\
    \ a thorough and synchronized strategy.\nEffective addressing of the challenges\
    \ and capitalization on the opportunities presented by\nsmart technologies necessitates\
    \ collaboration among policymakers, urban planners, real\nestate professionals,\
    \ technology providers, and other associated stakeholders.\nAuthor Contributions:\

  explanation: "**Smart Building Integration into Smart City: Key Factors and Challenges**\n\
    \nThis systematic review examines the key factors influencing the integration\
    \ of smart buildings into smart cities, with a particular focus on the technological\
    \ aspects of the city.\n\n**Integration Framework of Smart Building into a Smart\
    \ City**\n\nThe study establishes a conceptual framework based on three dimensions:\n\
    \n1. **Physical Integration:** Physical connectivity and interaction between smart\
    \ buildings and city infrastructure.\n2. **Data Integration:** Shared and analyzed\
    \ data from smart buildings and other urban systems.\n3. **Functional Integration:**\
    \ Cooperative operation and alignment between smart building functions and city-level\
    \ objectives.\n\n**Key Technological Factors**\n\nThe study identifies 26 key\
    \ factors categorized into five infrastructure areas:\n\n1. **Smart Energy**\n\
    \   - Energy storage systems\n   - Sharing electrical energy storage\n   - Ability\

    \ with an estimated 4.6 billion\npeople, accounting for 58% of the global population,\
    \ residing in urban areas by 2025. This\nproportion may reach as high as 81% in\
    \ certain developed regions. This demographic\nshift presents signiﬁcant challenges\
    \ for city planners, who must devise strategies to ensure\nsustainable living\
    \ conditions for the growing urban population [1]. One potential solution\nlies\
    \ in the development of smart cities and smart buildings. However, the lack of\
    \ a\nuniversally accepted deﬁnition for these concepts poses a challenge, making\
    \ it essential to\ngain a comprehensive understanding and establish a consensus\
    \ on the precise meaning of\nsmart cities and smart buildings.\nBy embracing the\
    \ principles of smart cities and integrating smart buildings into urban\ninfrastructure,\
    \ cities can enhance their efﬁciency, sustainability, and quality of life [2].\n\
    The concept of a smart city encompasses various infrastructure domains such as\
    \ energy,\nmobility, water, security, and waste management, where digital technologies\
    \ and data-\ndriven solutions play a crucial role [3]. Similarly, smart buildings\
    \ embody advanced\ntechnologies and systems that optimize resource utilization,\
    \ improve occupant comfort,\nand enable efﬁcient operation and management [4].\n\
    Smart Cities 2023, 6, 1832–1857. https://doi.org/10.3390/smartcities6040085\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/smartcities\nSmart Cities 2023, 6\n1833\nTo fully\
    \ harness the potential of smart buildings, it is essential to integrate the function-\n\
    alities proposed by various smart city infrastructure domains and, reciprocally,\
    \ leverage the\nrecommended features of smart building services to beneﬁt the\
    \ surrounding systems [2].\nHowever, in many cases, urban infrastructure components\
    \ operate independently without\nintegration. Therefore, a comprehensive approach\
    \ is necessary to maximize the capabilities\nof smart infrastructure and develop\
    \ smart cities effectively. Collaborative efforts involving\nscientists from diverse\
    \ ﬁelds, policymakers, planners, managers, civil society representa-\ntives, and\
    \ other relevant stakeholders prove to be advantageous and effective [5,6].\n\
    The integration of smart building features suggested by smart city infrastructure\n\
    domains implies that buildings should be designed to facilitate seamless interaction\
    \ with\nexisting and anticipated city infrastructure [7]. Potential strategies\
    \ may involve the inte-\ngration of intelligent infrastructure within urban areas,\
    \ such as the convergence of smart\nbuildings with the city’s smart grid to optimize\
    \ energy consumption [8], establishing con-\nnections between smart buildings\
    \ and public transportation to mitigate environmental\nimpact [8–10], or implementing\
    \ intelligent waste management systems that align with the\ncity’s existing waste\
    \ management infrastructure.\nThe integration of smart buildings into the existing\
    \ smart city systems is a topic of\nincreasing interest and importance [11]. As\
    \ urban populations continue to grow and the\ndemand for resources escalates,\
    \ it becomes imperative to explore innovative solutions\nthat maximize the utilization\
    \ of available resources while minimizing their environmental\nimpact [12]. Smart\
    \ building integration offers a promising avenue for achieving these goals\nby\
    \ incorporating advanced technologies, automation, and data-driven systems into\
    \ the\ndesign, construction, and operation of buildings [13].\nBy adopting an\
    \ integrated approach and incorporating the suggested features of smart\ndomain\
    \ infrastructure domains into smart building design [7], cities can capitalize\
    \ on the\nsynergistic beneﬁts that arise from the harmonious interaction between\
    \ buildings and\ntheir surrounding infrastructure. These strategies enable resource\
    \ optimization, enhanced\nsustainability, and improved quality of life for urban\
    \ residents [14,15].\nTo address the challenges and complexities associated with\
    \ the integration of smart\nbuildings into smart cities, this research aims to\
    \ analyze the key technological factors that\ninﬂuence this integration. By identifying\
    \ these factors and understanding their implications,\npolicymakers, urban planners,\
    \ and stakeholders can make informed decisions and develop\neffective strategies\
    \ for successful integration. The research will contribute to the existing\nbody\
    \ of knowledge by providing insights into the multifaceted aspects of smart building\n\
    integration into a smart city and highlighting the importance of addressing energy\
    \ efﬁciency,\nmobility, water conservation, security, and waste management in\
    \ the context of smart\ncities. Ultimately, this research seeks to pave the way\
    \ for sustainable and resilient urban\nenvironments that can cater to the needs\
    \ of the expanding urban population.\nThe paper’s structure is organized as follows.\
    \ Firstly, an exploration of the concept of\nsmart building, including the requirements\
    \ and frameworks for successful implementation\nis carried out. This is followed\
    \ by the concept of a smart city, highlighting the importance\nof digitalization\
    \ and its impact on various infrastructure domains within a smart city.\nSubsequently,\
    \ the paper focuses on the integration of smart buildings into smart cities,\n\
    presenting a conceptual framework that emphasizes the interdependencies and beneﬁts\
    \ of\nintegration. To achieve the research aim, an in-depth analysis of relevant\
    \ research studies,\ncase studies, best practices, and expert opinions was employed.\

    \ Building\nThe concept of a smart building has gained signiﬁcant attention in\
    \ the context of\ncreating sustainable, energy-efﬁcient, and intelligent built\
    \ environments.\nSmart buildings possess several key features that set them apart\
    \ from traditional build-\nings. Firstly, they incorporate automated systems for\
    \ environmental control, including\nheating, ventilation, air conditioning (HVAC),\
    \ lighting, and shading. These systems use\nreal-time data from sensors to adjust\
    \ settings based on occupancy, weather conditions, and\nenergy consumption patterns,\
    \ leading to energy efﬁciency and enhanced occupant com-\nfort [16]. Secondly,\
    \ smart buildings employ advanced building management systems (BMS)\nthat integrate\
    \ various subsystems and devices into a centralized platform. This allows for\n\
    centralized monitoring, control, and analysis of building operations, leading\
    \ to improved\noperational efﬁciency, predictive maintenance, and proactive decision\
    \ making [17].\nMoreover, smart buildings leverage data analytics and machine\
    \ learning algorithms\nto derive insights from collected data. By analyzing patterns,\
    \ trends, and anomalies, these\nbuildings can optimize resource utilization, identify\
    \ energy-saving opportunities, and\nanticipate maintenance needs [18]. The use\
    \ of data-driven insights enables continuous\nimprovement and adaptability within\
    \ smart buildings. The development of smart buildings\nis driven by various technological\
    \ advancements. Firstly, the proliferation of sensing\ntechnologies and IoT devices\
    \ has made it possible to collect real-time data on building\nperformance, occupancy,\
    \ and environmental conditions. These sensors provide valuable\ninputs for monitoring,\
    \ control, and optimization strategies [19].\nFurthermore, advancements in data\
    \ analytics and cloud computing enable the process-\ning and storage of vast amounts\
    \ of data generated by smart buildings. Machine learning\nalgorithms can analyze\
    \ this data to extract meaningful insights and support decision-\nmaking processes\
    \ [20]. Cloud-based platforms also enable remote access, monitoring, and\ncontrol\
    \ of smart building systems, enhancing operational ﬂexibility and scalability\
    \ [21].\nAdditionally, the emergence of edge computing and wireless communication\
    \ technologies\nfacilitates real-time data processing and reduces latency in smart\
    \ building applications [22].\nEdge devices, such as edge servers and gateways,\
    \ enable local data processing and analysis,\nenhancing the responsiveness and\
    \ efﬁciency of smart building systems.\nSmart buildings intelligently control\
    \ internal environments by integrating building\nsystems on a single network and\
    \ adapting characteristics of construction materials and\nfaçade elements to changing\
    \ usage and weather conditions. Furthermore, a crucial feature\nof a smart building\
    \ is the provision of building services that optimize occupant productivity\n\
    while simultaneously reducing costs and minimizing environmental impact. Technological\n\
    advancements in regulating the interior environment have led to the emergence\
    \ of smart\nbuildings as responsive and controlled environments for inhabitants,\
    \ companies, and\nsociety [23]. The objective of smart buildings is to achieve\
    \ a state of self-management,\nlearning, prediction, and adaptation without requiring\
    \ any intervention or awareness\nfrom their occupants. Sensors and monitors can\
    \ expeditiously and autonomously modify\nambient temperatures, illumination, shading,\
    \ energy efﬁciency, and water usage. One of\nthe applications of the IoT in urban\
    \ contexts is the utilization of ICT to enhance the quality\nof life for occupants\
    \ in smart building environments [24].\n2.2. Smart Building Evaluation Frameworks\n\
    Smart buildings are designed to meet speciﬁc requirements and follow established\n\
    frameworks that guide their development and operation. One of the primary requirements\n\
    for smart buildings is energy efﬁciency. Energy consumption in buildings accounts\
    \ for\na signiﬁcant portion of global energy use, making energy efﬁciency a crucial\
    \ consider-\nation in smart building design [8]. Energy-efﬁcient systems, such\
    \ as high-performance\nSmart Cities 2023, 6\n1835\nHVAC systems, advanced lighting\
    \ controls, and smart metering, are integrated into smart\nbuildings to minimize\
    \ energy consumption and reduce environmental impact [25]. Energy\nperformance\
    \ certiﬁcation (EPC) is a system that rates the energy efﬁciency of buildings.\n\
    Smart building is considered to compile the features of a sustainable building\
    \ as\nwell [15]. In this regard, BREEAM, LEED, DGNB, and other national-level\
    \ frameworks\nare established to guide the design, implementation, and evaluation\
    \ of sustainable build-\nings. The European Commission recently launched LEVEL(s),\
    \ a framework for sustainable\nbuildings that connects the speciﬁc performance\
    \ of the building to European policy objec-\ntives [26].\nAutomation is another\
    \ essential aspect of smart building requirements. Automation\nalso enables the\
    \ implementation of advanced features like adaptive lighting, predictive\nmaintenance,\
    \ and demand response [27]. Building management systems (BMS) and build-\ning\
    \ automation and control systems (BACS) are used for the integration and interoperability\n\
    of various building systems, including HVAC, lighting, security, and ﬁre safety\
    \ [28]. The\nBMS focuses on centralized monitoring, control, and optimization,\
    \ enabling the seamless\noperation of these systems within smart buildings.\n\
    In relation to automation and BMS, some frameworks were developed to assess the\n\
    smartness of buildings, including, for example, the smart readiness indicator\
    \ (SRI) and\nSPIRE. The SRI framework was introduced by the European Commission\
    \ in 2018 and\nused to assess the preparedness of buildings for smart technologies\
    \ [29]. It consists of\nthree pillars: systems integration, real-time data, and\
    \ human-centered design. The SRI\nframework is an extensive methodology for determining\
    \ a building’s readiness to exploit\nsmart technologies. The SPIRE program, which\
    \ has been created by UL Solutions (a\nglobal leader in applied safety science),\
    \ is a certiﬁcation initiative that centers on the\nkey aspects of sustainability,\
    \ performance, innovation, reliability, and user-friendliness in\nthe context\
    \ of smart buildings. The SPIRE technology is instrumental in promoting the\n\
    development of intelligent buildings and safeguarding their advantages for proprietors\n\
    and the ecosystem [30].\nData analytics plays a signiﬁcant role in smart building\
    \ frameworks. By collecting and\nanalyzing data from sensors, meters, and other\
    \ sources, smart buildings can derive valuable\ninsights to improve performance\
    \ and optimize operations. Data analytics techniques,\nincluding machine learning\
    \ and artiﬁcial intelligence, enable advanced functionalities\nsuch as anomaly\
    \ detection, fault diagnostics, and predictive analytics [20]. These insights\n\
    facilitate data-driven decision making and enable proactive maintenance, resulting\
    \ in\nimproved energy efﬁciency and reduced operational costs. Thus, by employing\
    \ data\nanalytics, digital twin platforms have emerged as powerful tools in the\
    \ context of smart\nbuilding frameworks.\nA digital twin is a virtual replica\
    \ of a physical building that is continuously updated\nwith real-time data from\
    \ sensors and other sources. The presented frameworks emphasize\ndifferent DT\
    \ maturity levels of the smart building management and control strategies in-\n\
    cluding reactive strategy (most buildings’ status), real-time based on IoT driven,\
    \ predictive\nstrategy, and proactive strategy [31]. However, certain challenges\
    \ might be faced in adopt-\ning digital twin platforms. First, the implementation\
    \ of digital twin technology requires a\nsigniﬁcant investment in sensor deployment\
    \ and data infrastructure. Additionally, data\nprivacy and security concerns must\
    \ be addressed when collecting and analyzing sensitive\nbuilding data. Safeguarding\
    \ the privacy of occupants and protecting the building’s systems\nfrom cyber threats\
    \ are critical considerations in the adoption of digital twin platforms [32].\n\
    Despite these challenges, the integration of digital twin (DT) platforms with\
    \ data analytics\nholds great potential for optimizing the performance and operations\
    \ of smart buildings, it\nis expected that digital twin platforms will play an\
    \ increasingly signiﬁcant role in shaping\nthe future of smart building frameworks.\n\
    As it was presented above, various assessment schemes might be applicable to evaluate\n\
    certain aspects of smart buildings. However, there is a huge challenge to combine\
    \ all these\naspects into one single framework.\nSmart Cities 2023, 6\n1836\n\
    3. Smart City\n3.1. Concept of Smart City\nThe concept of a smart city has undergone\
    \ signiﬁcant development and has garnered\nattention in both academic and practical\
    \ spheres. Over the years, various deﬁnitions\nand characteristics have been proposed\
    \ to capture the essence of a smart city. Table 1\nprovides a compilation of several\
    \ studies that conceptualize the smart city deﬁnition\nfrom a functional point\
    \ of view. These deﬁnitions highlight the signiﬁcance of human\ncapital, social\
    \ capital, information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure,\nnetwork\
    \ infrastructure, physical infrastructure, wireless sensor networks (WSNs), Internet\n\
    of things (IoT), technology revolution, and digital technology as integral components\
    \ of\nsmart cities [33].\nTable 1. Smart city deﬁnitions proposed by different\

    Digital solution\nSmart Cities 2023, 6\n1837\nIn addition, the concept of a smart\
    \ city emphasizes the ability to act proactively and\nadapt to changing circumstances\
    \ [34]. It embraces advanced technologies such as artiﬁcial\nintelligence (AI)\
    \ [42], data analytics, and automation to enable intelligent systems and\nservices.\
    \ The adaptive nature of smart city services, ICT systems, infrastructure, and\n\
    buildings is crucial for providing customized, efﬁcient, and responsive solutions\
    \ to the\nneeds of citizens [35,36].\nThe overarching goal of a smart city paradigm\
    \ is to achieve contemporary urban gov-\nernance by utilizing advanced technical\
    \ instruments and cutting-edge technologies while\nconsidering ecological norms\
    \ and optimizing resource consumption [40]. The integration\nof digital technologies,\
    \ data-driven solutions, and sustainable practices remains at the core\nof smart\
    \ city development. By leveraging these elements, smart cities strive to enhance\n\
    the quality of life, improve efﬁciency in urban operations, and create sustainable\
    \ urban\nenvironments for their residents.\nThe integration of smart and resilient\
    \ city concepts holds great potential for enhancing\nresiliency in numerous ways\
    \ [43]. Smart cities leverage technology to gather and analyze\ndata, which can\
    \ be utilized to identify and mitigate risks. With the large amount of\ndata acquired\
    \ by smart cities, data-driven decision making becomes possible, enabling\nproactive\
    \ risk assessment and resource allocation. Collaboration is essential for efﬁcient\n\
    solution development and implementation among smart and resilient cities, as well\
    \ as with\nvarious stakeholders such as enterprises, academics, and the general\
    \ public. Furthermore,\ninnovation is critical in embracing new technology and\
    \ techniques to handle shifting\ndifﬁculties [44].\n3.2. Role of Digitalization\
    \ in Smart Cities\nDigitalization plays a pivotal role in the development of smart\
    \ cities, revolutionizing\nurban infrastructure and services through the integration\
    \ of digital technologies and con-\nnectivity. This section highlights the importance\
    \ of digitalization and its inﬂuence on urban\ninfrastructure and services in\
    \ the context of smart city development [45].\nThe conventional city system consists\
    \ of two primary layers, namely the infrastructure\nand services layers. The infrastructure\
    \ layer pertains to the tangible constituents of the\nsystem and furnishes fundamental\
    \ services that are integrated within the urban regions. It\nis regarded as the\
    \ intermediary between the city residents and natural resources, thereby\nlaying\
    \ the groundwork for all the crucial aspects associated with the city, such as\
    \ individ-\nuals, ediﬁces, mobility, economy, governance, energy, water, and environment\
    \ [46]. The\nservices layer, commonly known as the “business layer,” is constructed\
    \ on a foundation\nof infrastructure and encompasses a range of activities that\
    \ support the inhabitants of a\ncity. These activities include municipal tasks\
    \ such as water supply, waste management,\nenvironmental management, and energy\
    \ distribution, among others [46]. The fundamental\naspect that can successfully\
    \ transform a City 1.0 into a City 2.0, commonly referred to as a\nsmart city,\
    \ is the incorporation of a data layer, also known as the digital layer.\nThe\
    \ process of digitalization has facilitated the development of intelligent infras-\n\
    tructure and urban areas. The digitization of physical space and energy, information\n\
    transmission, user and asset management, and business operations has been a gradual\n\
    process [45]. The timely capture and sharing of information are crucial value\
    \ propositions\nof ICT in the context of a smart city. Provided that the information\
    \ is delivered promptly\nand with precision, urban areas have the potential to\

    \ enables collective optimization, where\nsmart buildings work together as a system\
    \ to achieve shared goals, such as load balancing,\ndemand response, and environmental\
    \ impact reduction [11,59].\n4.2. Importance of Integration for Efﬁciency, Resilience,\
    \ and Sustainability of City Performance\nThe integration of smart buildings into\
    \ smart cities is crucial for achieving efﬁciency,\nresilience, and sustainability\
    \ in city performance.\nEfﬁciency refers to the use of technology and data-driven\
    \ solutions to improve the\nperformance and quality of municipal services while\
    \ consuming fewer resources and\nspending less money. By integrating energy-efﬁcient\
    \ systems, smart meters, and advanced\ncontrol algorithms, smart buildings contribute\
    \ to overall energy savings and reduced\nenvironmental impact [60]. The integration\
    \ allows for coordinated energy management\nstrategies, such as load shifting,\
    \ peak shaving, and renewable energy utilization [61],\nleading to enhanced energy\
    \ efﬁciency and reduced greenhouse gas emissions [62].\nFurthermore, integration\
    \ enables resource optimization by leveraging the intercon-\nnectedness of smart\
    \ buildings with other urban systems. The integration of smart buildings\nwith\
    \ smart grids facilitates demand response initiatives, whereby buildings adapt\
    \ their\nenergy usage in response to grid conditions and pricing cues [17]. This\
    \ collaboration\nbetween buildings and the grid leads to more efﬁcient energy\
    \ distribution, reduced strain\non the grid, and enhanced overall system reliability.\n\
    Within the framework of integrating the smart building into a smart city, environmen-\n\
    tal sustainability is another important metric in this scenario. It involves the\
    \ implementation\nof an energy-efﬁcient system such as renewable energy, advanced\
    \ control algorithms, ICT,\nand smart meters to curtail energy usage and mitigate\
    \ environmental impact [63]. Integra-\ntion also facilitates the optimization\
    \ of water management and waste management within\nsmart cities. Smart buildings\
    \ can incorporate water-efﬁcient technologies, such as smart\nirrigation [64],\
    \ rainwater harvesting systems, and greywater recycling [65] contributing to\n\
    water conservation at the city level [49]. In waste management, integration enables\
    \ real-\ntime monitoring of waste generation, optimized waste collection routes\
    \ [57], and improved\nrecycling practices, leading to efﬁcient waste management\
    \ and reduced environmental\nimpact [66].\nIn contrast, resilience usually refers\
    \ to the capacity of a system to withstand and recover\nfrom unexpected disturbances\
    \ and pressures while preserving its operational and adaptive\ncapabilities. The\
    \ concept of resilience in the realm of smart cities and buildings pertains to\n\
    the development of structures and urban infrastructures that possess the ability\
    \ to forecast,\nadapt, adjust to, and recuperate from disruptive occurrences [67].\
    \ The integration of\nsmart buildings into smart cities in a resilient manner\
    \ involves implementing strategies to\nstrengthen infrastructure durability, enhance\
    \ emergency response mechanisms, and foster\ncommunity resilience, as indicated\
    \ in [43]. The integration of resilient characteristics in\nsmart buildings can\
    \ effectively enhance the overall resilience of urban areas by minimizing\nthe\
    \ adverse effects of various disruptions, including but not limited to natural\
    \ calamities,\nclimate change, and system breakdowns. The integration in question\
    \ allows for the prompt\nmonitoring of multiple parameters in real time, thereby\
    \ enabling swift responses and\nadaptable measures in emergency situations [68].\n\
    To improve efﬁciency, resilience, and sustainability in city performance, smart\
    \ build-\nings need to be integrated into smart cities. The connectivity of smart\
    \ buildings with\nother urban systems allows for coordinated energy management\
    \ techniques, which in turn\nleads to increased energy efﬁciency, decreased greenhouse\
    \ gas emissions, and resource\noptimization. Energy conservation is achieved through\
    \ the incorporation of water-efﬁcient\ntechnologies and optimized waste management\
    \ practices, while environmental impact\nis lessened by reducing energy consumption\
    \ and using renewable energy sources and\ncutting-edge control algorithms and\
    \ smart meters. Finally, smart cities aim to improve\nSmart Cities 2023, 6\n1842\n\
    infrastructure longevity, and emergency response mechanisms by integrating security\n\
    systems, and community resilience through the incorporation of smart buildings.\n\
    4.3. Enhanced Urban Living through Smart Services\nThe integration of smart buildings\
    \ into smart cities ultimately aims to enhance urban\nliving experiences. By integrating\
    \ technologies such as Internet of things (IoT) devices, data\nanalytics, and\
    \ personalized services, smart buildings can provide tailored and responsive\n\
    experiences to occupants [59]. This includes adaptive lighting, personalized comfort\n\
    settings, and optimized indoor environmental quality [27]. Integration also enables\
    \ smart\nbuilding services to extend beyond individual buildings, such as smart\
    \ parking, shared\nmobility, and intelligent community services.\nThe implementation\
    \ of ubiquitous computing technology relies on the integration\nand organized\
    \ interconnection of smart service systems that oversee the administration of\n\
    ediﬁces and urban areas [20,40], as well as their engagement with users. The initial\
    \ phase\ninvolved establishing and implementing the IoT [3], which involved linking\
    \ household\nappliances to the network and facilitating communication with the\
    \ building or municipal\ninfrastructure [2], as well as with the user. Subsequently,\
    \ a methodical approach involves the\ninstallation of diverse sensors and devices\
    \ within buildings [59]. This, in conjunction with\nthe IoT, facilitates the gathering,\
    \ transmission, analysis, and reaction to the accumulated\ndata and additional\
    \ engagement with occupants.\nThe optimization of city infrastructure systems,\
    \ including energy, water, and trafﬁc,\nis a signiﬁcant advantage of urban intelligent\
    \ systems and smart building networking.\nUntil recently, the capabilities of\
    \ integration and system interaction have been restricted\nto data transfer technologies.\
    \ However, the emergence of the 5G network has altered\nthis landscape, as its\
    \ data transfer rate is now sufﬁcient to support the implementation of\nautonomous\
    \ vehicle transport and other advanced applications. It is anticipated that the\n\
    current speed standard will be augmented in the near future, thereby facilitating\
    \ additional\nadvancement and interactivity of said systems.\nIt is imperative\
    \ to acknowledge the wider societal and technological ramiﬁcations\nof IoT advancement,\
    \ while also prioritizing the interdependent connection between the\nintelligent\
    \ frameworks of smart cities and smart buildings. The investigation of these\n\
    effects is currently underway in numerous ﬁelds. However, it is important to acknowledge\n\
    that the optimal implementation of such projects requires the synergy of urban\
    \ systems,\nincluding infrastructure, transportation, and administration.\n5.\
    \ Factors Affecting Smart Building Integration into Smart City\nThis part of the\
    \ paper synthesizes the ﬁndings and provides a comprehensive analysis\nof the\
    \ factors inﬂuencing smart building integration into smart cities taking into\
    \ account\nthe technological aspects of the city. Given the multitude of factors\
    \ identiﬁed, the study\nconducted a synthesis to organize and categorize them\
    \ based on thematic areas. This\ncategorization led to the identiﬁcation of ﬁve\
    \ main infrastructure areas: smart energy, smart\nmobility, smart water, smart\
    \ security systems, and smart waste management. Each of these\nthematic areas\
    \ is described in detail in the subsequent subsections. By categorizing the\n\
    factors according to their respective infrastructure, it aimed to provide a comprehensive\n\
    understanding of the different aspects that contribute to the integration of smart\
    \ build-\nings into smart cities. The detailed descriptions of each thematic area\
    \ enabled a deeper\nexploration and analysis of the factors involved in each domain.\n\
    5.1. Factors Related to Smart Energy\nThe smart energy services of a smart building\
    \ are essential for all aspects of both smart\nbuildings and shaping the overall\
    \ performance and sustainability of the smart city, from\npowering homes and businesses\
    \ to providing transportation and lighting. For example, the\nintegration of energy\
    \ storage systems such as batteries of advanced storage technologies in\nsmart\
    \ buildings enhances energy management capabilities [69], which enables the capture\n\
    Smart Cities 2023, 6\n1843\nand utilization of surplus energy generated by renewable\
    \ sources [61], allowing for better\ndemand response management, load balancing,\
    \ and peak shaving. Smart buildings serve\nas key nodes in the integration of\
    \ smart grids, enabling bidirectional communication and\ndynamic energy management\
    \ [8]. Therefore, the impact of smart energy solutions in smart\nbuildings is\
    \ substantial in smart cities as well. Through renewable energy adoption, energy\n\
    efﬁciency measures, energy storage, sharing thermal energy, and integration with\
    \ smart\ngrids, smart buildings contribute to the overall sustainability, resilience,\
    \ and efﬁciency of\nsmart cities. By embracing these technologies and approaches,\

    \ security system is a top-priority integral component for a smart building\n\
    and a city [88]. Smart buildings are tapping into the IoT to enable more applications\
    \ to\nconnect, and that includes physical security solutions presented in Table\
    \ 6, such as video\nsurveillance, ﬁre detection, disaster event communication,\
    \ and smart security lights. In a\nsmart building, video surveillance solutions\
    \ can identify potential risks, such as a person of\ninterest in a parking lot\
    \ [89], track that person, and report ﬁndings back to a security team,\nall in\
    \ real time. These technologies enable better monitoring, detection, and response\
    \ to\nﬁre [90], resulting in improved safety measures and performance within a\
    \ city, enabling\nearly detection, enhancing incident command centers, improving\
    \ ﬁre suppression methods,\nand providing situational awareness to ﬁreﬁghters.\
    \ All these solutions have a signiﬁcant\nimpact on a city’s performance by increasing\
    \ safety, minimizing damage, and facilitating\nefﬁcient emergency response. In\
    \ the same scenario, IoT devices are utilized to collect data\nand aid in the\
    \ identiﬁcation of alarms following disasters as well as the localization of\n\
    injured persons [90].\nTable 6. Factors enabling smart security services.\nFactors\n\

    \ to Smart Waste Management\nWaste management often entails waste monitoring,\
    \ collection, transportation, process-\ning, recycling, and disposal. Smart waste\
    \ management systems aid in waste reduction by\nSmart Cities 2023, 6\n1846\ncategorizing\
    \ garbage at the source and developing ways for proper waste disposal. Such\n\
    systems could be used to recycle garbage and establish closed-loop economies.\
    \ Their key\nadvantages are improved garbage collection, pick up, separation,\
    \ reuse, and recycling\nefﬁciency. One of the most signiﬁcant inefﬁciencies in\
    \ trash management is the inability to\npredict when waste will be collected;\
    \ trucks are frequently dispatched to collect rubbish\nwhen bins are not full.\
    \ Sensors, connection, and the Internet of things (IoT) provide strate-\ngies\
    \ to avoid additional expenses associated with such inefﬁciencies, where a smart\
    \ bin\nand automated waste collection smart waste management systems monitor the\
    \ movement\nof various types of garbage, and technology can be used to better\
    \ understand and manage\nthe ﬂow of waste from source to disposal [6]. Table 7\

    6. Case Studies of Successful Smart Buildings Integration into Smart Cities\n\
    6.1. Introduction to Case Studies\nFive case studies from different geographical\
    \ locations were selected to highlight\nsuccessful smart building projects that\
    \ demonstrate fulﬁlled integration requirements\nbased on the smart infrastructure\
    \ development of the city.\nThe Edge is a highly intelligent and ecologically\
    \ efﬁcient building located in the\nNetherlands, in Amsterdam’s Zuidas business\
    \ sector. It received a 98.4% rating on the\nBREEAM scale in 2015 [99], the highest\
    \ ever recorded. Deloitte occupies the 40,000-square-\nfoot ofﬁce building. Advanced\
    \ sensor systems, lighting control systems, rainwater reuse,\nsmart HVAC systems,\
    \ thermal energy storage systems, and a central building management\nsystem (BMS)\
    \ for real-time monitoring are all part of the building’s design. The Edge\ncombines\
    \ several technologies, such as IoT connection, a cloud-based analytics platform,\n\
    intelligent meters, and real-time energy monitoring. It also emphasizes the signiﬁcance\
    \ of\nongoing feedback and occupant participation to increase comfort and satisfaction.\
    \ By part-\nnering with local community partners, the building’s design also promotes\
    \ environmental\nmeasures [100,101].\nOne Angel Square, a Manchester-based smart\
    \ building in the UK, aims to create a\nsustainable and energy-efﬁcient working\
    \ environment for its occupants [102]. The building\nincorporates intelligent\
    \ lighting systems, a combined heat and power plant, and heat\nrecovery systems\
    \ for heating and cooling [103]. It also utilizes building automation, control\n\
    systems, energy management software, and renewable energy sources like rooftop\
    \ solar\npanels. The building’s design incorporates social and stakeholder engagement\
    \ strategies,\ninvolving occupants and local community stakeholders. One Angel\
    \ Square has achieved\nBREEAM outstanding certiﬁcation for sustainability [104],\
    \ reducing energy consumption by\nover 50% compared to previous ofﬁce buildings.\
    \ This achievement showcases the successful\nintegration of smart technologies,\
    \ energy-efﬁcient systems, and stakeholder engagement in\ncreating a highly sustainable\
    \ and environmentally friendly ofﬁce building [105].\nThe National University\
    \ of Singapore (NUS) was designated as the Green Mark\nPlatinum Champion for its\
    \ outstanding role in sustainable development, successfully\nobtaining a 50 Green\
    \ Mark certiﬁcate and being awarded Zero Energy winner for its\ncampuses [106].\
    \ The bestowed recognition is conferred upon structures that have been\nSmart\
    \ Cities 2023, 6\n1847\ncertiﬁed for their achievement in attaining either zero\
    \ energy consumption or exceptionally\nlow energy consumption levels. The university\
    \ has set a goal of achieving carbon neutrality\non its campus by the year 2030\
    \ [107]. In addition, it has implemented a smart building\nintegration program\
    \ to improve energy efﬁciency, occupant comfort, and operational\nefﬁciency. The\
    \ program includes smart lighting systems with occupancy and daylight\nsensors,\
    \ personalized HVAC systems, and an integrated building management system\n(iBMS).\
    \ Real-time energy monitoring and analytics are employed to provide insights into\n\
    energy consumption patterns and facilitate targeted energy-saving strategies.\
    \ This has led\nto signiﬁcant reductions in energy consumption and carbon emissions,\
    \ improved occupant\ncomfort and productivity, and the successful implementation\
    \ of demand response strategies\nfor peak load management [108].\nOngos Valley,\
    \ a smart building development in Windhoek, Namibia, focuses on\nsustainable design\
    \ and advanced technologies to create an environmentally friendly com-\nmunity.\
    \ By integrating renewable energy sources and implementing efﬁcient water man-\n\
    agement practices, the project reduces dependence on traditional energy sources\
    \ and\nachieves a lower carbon footprint [109]. Ongos Valley prioritizes residents’\
    \ quality of life\nand well-being, promoting a comfortable and sustainable living\
    \ environment [110]. The\nproject emphasizes collaborative partnerships with local\
    \ stakeholders, fostering a collective\napproach to project success and long-term\
    \ sustainability [111].\nReliance MET City, a large-scale development near Gurgaon,\
    \ India, focuses on sustain-\nable urban living by integrating smart building\
    \ systems and reducing energy consumption\nand carbon emissions. It prioritizes\
    \ waste management and recycling practices to promote\nenvironmental sustainability\
    \ [112]. MET City aims to improve the quality of life and livabil-\nity of residents,\
    \ offering a comfortable and advanced urban environment [113]. Reliance\nMET City,\
    \ a subsidiary of Reliance Industries Limited, is developing state-of-the-art\
    \ in-\nfrastructure and amenities, offering a ‘walk to work’ advantage to residents.\
    \ With rapid\ngrowth, the city has become a hub for economic development, attracting\
    \ companies and\nresidential customers [114].\n6.2. Case Study Analysis and Results\n\
    Table 8 presents a summary of the above-mentioned case studies analysis showcasing\n\
    successful smart building integration into smart cities. It provides information\
    \ about key\nintegration factors addressed in the previous chapter of this paper.\n\
    The graphical representation of the technological factors enabling smart services\n\
    implemented in each case study is presented in Figure 3. All of the indicators\
    \ from the list of\n26 were proven. In the energy sector, European cities, particularly\
    \ Amsterdam, demonstrate\na strong focus on sustainability and resilience [115],\
    \ which involves the implementation\nof an energy-efﬁcient system and the ability\
    \ to adapt to disruptive occurrences, such\nas renewable energy, energy storage\
    \ advanced control algorithms, and ICT to curtail\nenergy usage and mitigate environmental\
    \ impact. They lead in energy storage and off-\ngrid potential, indicating a commitment\
    \ to integrating renewable energy sources and\nenhancing energy management. According\
    \ to Figure 3, The Edge in Amsterdam has 5 out\nof 7 services integrated to address\
    \ their smart city goals in the context of energy storage\nand implementing renewable\
    \ energy sources. On the other hand, Asian cities prioritize\nsmart EV infrastructure,\
    \ reﬂecting their goals of promoting electric transportation and\naddressing concerns\
    \ related to rapid motorization. This regional variation highlights the\ndifferent\
    \ approaches taken toward energy transition and sustainability [116]. Two Asian\n\
    projects, i.e., Reliance MET, Gurgaon, India and (NUS) smart buildings, Singapore,\
    \ have\nenergy services 4 and 3 out of 7, respectively.\nWhen it comes to mobility,\
    \ all analyzed case studies are developed to promote smart\nand sustainable mobility.\
    \ European cities stand out in promoting shared mobility services\nand reducing\
    \ private car usage [117]. Both The Edge in Amsterdam and One Angle Square\nin\
    \ the UK integrated 5 mobility services out of 6. This emphasizes their commitment\
    \ to\nsustainable transportation solutions, reducing trafﬁc congestion, and enhancing\
    \ last-mile\nSmart Cities 2023, 6\n1848\nconnectivity. Asian cities (NUS, Singapore—5\
    \ out of 6 services; Reliance MET, Gurgaon,\nIndia—4 out of 6 services) address\
    \ the challenges of rapid urbanization by placing a stronger\nemphasis on promoting\
    \ sharing mobility, video surveillance, and parking management,\nindicating concerns\
    \ related to motorization and the need for efﬁcient parking solutions [116].\n\
    African cities lag behind in smart mobility, likely due to cost constraints and\
    \ infrastructure\nchallenges they face in implementing advanced mobility systems.\n\

    \ Case studies: key factors related to smart services of different smart cities\
    \ domains.\nIn water and waste management, regional patterns are evident. Water\
    \ conservation\nand recycling initiatives are more prevalent in regions with water\
    \ scarcity, such as in Africa\nand India (4 out of 6 water services). Singapore\
    \ stands out for its comprehensive smart\nSmart Cities 2023, 6\n1850\nwater management\
    \ initiatives, emphasizing the importance of efﬁcient water use in a water-\n\
    stressed environment [118]. In waste management, European cities lead in automation,\n\
    sensors, and data analytics, reﬂecting their focus on achieving greater efﬁciency\
    \ and\nsustainability goals [49]. Other regions primarily utilize basic smart\
    \ bins due to a lack of\nadequate infrastructure, suggesting the potential for\
    \ further development and utilization\nof waste data.\nThe security domain demonstrates\
    \ high development status within the selected case\nstudies: The Edge, Amsterdam\
    \ and Ongos Valley, Windhoek have security as a ﬁrst priority\n(5 out of 5) while\
    \ the rest of the projects have implemented 4 smart services out of 5. This\n\
    shows that the enhanced smart city initiatives provide the overall measurements\
    \ to increase\nnot only the efﬁciency and sustainability but the resilience of\
    \ smart city performance,\nincluding safety and security services for their inhabitants\
    \ as well.\nBased on the analysis of case studies, several recommendations can\
    \ be made to\nenhance the technological aspects of smart city initiatives. Firstly,\
    \ there is a need to\nexpand renewable energy and storage solutions to increase\
    \ self-sufﬁciency and resilience\nagainst grid disruptions. Technologies such\
    \ as vehicle-to-grid systems and energy trading\nplatforms can facilitate the\
    \ integration of mobility and energy sectors. Furthermore, scaling\nsustainable\
    \ mobility options like shared vehicles, e-buses, and demand-responsive transit\n\
    can improve convenience and reduce congestion. Integration of payment and scheduling\n\
    systems across different modes of transport will enhance usability. Additionally,\
    \ expanding\nenvironmental monitoring by leveraging low-cost sensors can provide\
    \ hyperlocal data\non air and water quality, which can inform evidence-based policies.\
    \ It is also essential\nto invest in cybersecurity measures and develop robust\
    \ data governance frameworks to\naddress privacy concerns and build public trust.\
    \ Finally, pursuing regional partnerships\nand knowledge exchange with other cities\
    \ can facilitate the replication of successful use\ncases and accelerate smart\
    \ city development. Collaborative efforts and a shared vision\nacross sectors\
    \ and stakeholders are essential for the realization of integrated, inclusive,\
    \ and\nsustainable smart cities. By learning from best practices and focusing\
    \ on local priorities,\ncities can drive the realization of technologically optimized\
    \ urban living in a way that best\nserves their communities.\n7. Discussion\n\
    In this chapter, the identiﬁed factors, their interrelationships, and their implications\n\
    for successful integration are discussed. Additionally, common challenges, limitations,\
    \ and\nareas for further research are identiﬁed.\nThe study reveals that 26 key\
    \ factors play a crucial role in the integration of smart\nbuildings into smart\
    \ cities. These factors include smart energy, smart mobility, smart water,\nsmart\
    \ security systems, and smart waste management infrastructure domain. Each of\
    \ these\nthematic areas has unique requirements, frameworks, and technologies\
    \ that contribute to\nthe overall integration process. Despite the progress made\
    \ in smart building integration\ninto smart cities, some common challenges need\
    \ to be addressed. These include data inter-\noperability, privacy and security\
    \ concerns, regulatory barriers, technological complexities,\nand the need for\
    \ scalable and cost-effective solutions.\nIn the context of smart energy integration,\
    \ the adoption of energy-efﬁcient systems,\nrenewable energy integration, and\
    \ demand-side management are essential. However,\nchallenges such as the coordination\
    \ of diverse energy resources and the integration of\nenergy storage systems need\
    \ to be addressed to ensure seamless integration and maximize\nenergy optimization.\n\
    Smart mobility integration requires the integration of smart transportation systems,\n\
    electric vehicles, and intelligent trafﬁc management. This integration enables\
    \ congestion\nreduction, emissions reduction, and enhanced mobility. Nevertheless,\
    \ challenges related to\ndata management, interoperability, and infrastructure\
    \ development must be overcome to\nfully realize the beneﬁts of smart mobility\
    \ integration.\nSmart Cities 2023, 6\n1851\nThe integration of smart water management\
    \ solutions enables water conservation and\nreuse, real-time leak detection, and\
    \ quality monitoring. It contributes to efﬁciency and\nsustainability in water\
    \ management. However, challenges related to data privacy, system\ninteroperability,\
    \ and infrastructure investment need to be addressed for successful smart\nwater\
    \ integration.\nSmart security systems, including intelligent surveillance, access\
    \ control, and emer-\ngency response systems, enhance safety, crime prevention,\
    \ and resilience in smart buildings\nand cities. However, privacy concerns, cybersecurity\
    \ threats, and the integration of diverse\nsecurity systems pose challenges to\
    \ effective integration.\nThe application of IoT-based waste monitoring, recycling,\
    \ and waste-to-energy systems\nin smart waste management contributes to efﬁcient\
    \ waste management and supports\ncircular economy goals. E-waste management practices,\
    \ on the other hand, should align\nwith the broader goals of sustainability and\
    \ environmental preservation within smart cities.\nThis can involve the use of\
    \ IoT techniques such as radio frequency (RFID) and sensor\ntechnology to track\
    \ and manage e-waste throughout its lifecycle [66]. However, challenges\nrelated\
    \ to data management, infrastructure, and public engagement need to be addressed\n\
    to achieve effective integration.\nThe integration of smart buildings into smart\
    \ cities raises concerns and potential risks.\nData protection becomes increasingly\
    \ important as smart buildings generate and gather\nmassive volumes of personal\
    \ and sensitive data, raising the danger of data breaches and\nillegal access.\
    \ Another concern is over surveillance, as continual monitoring via integrated\n\
    sensors and surveillance technology might intrude on privacy and personal freedom.\n\
    Furthermore, smart buildings may unintentionally contribute to inequality by raising\
    \ costs\nand posing accessibility issues for low-income populations. Finally,\
    \ an overreliance on\ntechnology in smart buildings may result in interruptions\
    \ and dependencies that disrupt\nvital activities. To address these threats, comprehensive\
    \ approaches such as strong data\nprotection rules, cybersecurity safeguards,\
    \ and fair access programs must be implemented,\nall while protecting privacy\
    \ rights and fostering openness.\nThe scope of this study is related to the technological\
    \ aspects of smart buildings\nintegration into smart cities, and this is the major\
    \ limitation. Additionally, a variety of other\naspects might be further investigated\
    \ in the future such as, for example, the impact of smart\nbuilding integration\
    \ on the social, economic, and environmental aspects of smart cities.\nThe human\
    \ factor (residents or building owners) is one such important factor that needs\n\
    to be carefully analyzed and assessed. The evaluation of long-term sustainability,\
    \ user\nacceptance, and the cost-effectiveness of integrated solutions is essential\
    \ for the successful\nimplementation of smart building integration projects. Adopting\
    \ a human-centric approach\nthat prioritizes equity and accessibility in service\
    \ delivery is also crucial. Citizen feedback\nloops through social media, mobile\
    \ apps, and the Internet of things can enable co-creation\nand ensure that smart\
    \ city initiatives address the needs of all residents. Challenges that\narise\
    \ from technological advances such as electromagnetic radiation of smart buildings\n\
    and smart cities, e-waste, a plethora of under-sea cables, etc., and their impact\
    \ on the\nintegration of smart buildings into a smart city have to be analyzed\
    \ and taken into account\nby decision makers.\nIn summary, advanced digital technologies\
    \ enable the integration of smart buildings\ninto smart cities and new smart services\
    \ provide enormous beneﬁts to the cities and their\ninhabitants. At the same time,\
    \ potential threads caused by certain technologies need to\nbe discussed and leveraged\
    \ in each infrastructure area; thus, additional measures should\nbe implemented\
    \ to minimize the negative effects correspondingly. These decisions are\nwithin\
    \ the responsibility limits of the city planners and smart city strategy development\n\
    authorities who pave the way for new technologies selection and implementation\
    \ to\nintegrate smart buildings into a particular smart city. Thus, further research\
    \ is required to\ndevelop standardized frameworks, guidelines, and best practices\
    \ for successful integration.\nThe next stage to continue this research is to\
    \ present the smart building integration into\nthe smart city evaluation framework\
    \ by considering the identiﬁed technological factors\nSmart Cities 2023, 6\n1852\n\
    and their impact on the efﬁciency, resilience, and environmental sustainability\
    \ of the\ncity’s performance.\n8. Conclusions\nThe presented study researched\
    \ the key factors affecting the smart building integration\ninto the smart city\
    \ considering technological aspects. The established conceptual framework\nrevealed\
    \ three key dimensions of smart building integration into a smart city: physical,\
    \ data,\nand functional. The research revealed that the successful integration\
    \ of smart buildings\ninto smart cities requires attention to multiple factors.\
    \ Through a comprehensive review\nof the relevant literature and case studies\
    \ research, 26 factors inﬂuencing integration in\nﬁve infrastructure areas, namely\
    \ smart energy, smart mobility, smart water, smart security\nsystems, and smart\
    \ waste management, were identiﬁed and discussed. The ﬁndings have\nimportant\
    \ implications for policymakers, urban planners, and stakeholders involved in\n\
    smart city development.\nIn the area of smart energy, the adoption of energy-efﬁcient\
    \ systems, renewable energy\nintegration, and demand-side management are critical\
    \ for achieving energy optimization\nand sustainability. Policymakers and urban\
    \ planners should prioritize the development of\nsupportive regulations, incentives,\
    \ and infrastructure to encourage the implementation of\nthese technologies.\n\
    Smart mobility integration plays a vital role in enhancing transportation efﬁciency\
    \ and\nreducing congestion and CO2 emissions. Policymakers and urban planners\
    \ should focus on\nthe integration of smart transportation systems, the promotion\
    \ of electric vehicles, and the\nimplementation of intelligent trafﬁc management\
    \ strategies. Investments in infrastructure,\nsuch as charging stations and smart\
    \ trafﬁc control systems, are necessary to support the\nwidespread adoption of\
    \ smart mobility solutions.\nSmart water management is essential for achieving\
    \ sustainable water use in smart\ncities. Policymakers and urban planners should\
    \ emphasize the integration of smart water\nmonitoring systems, leak detection\
    \ technologies, and water conservation practices. In-\nvestments in infrastructure\
    \ and the development of data-sharing mechanisms can enable\nefﬁcient water management\
    \ and ensure the long-term sustainability of water resources.\nThe integration\
    \ of smart security systems is crucial for ensuring the safety and re-\nsilience\
    \ of smart buildings and cities. Policymakers and stakeholders should prioritize\
    \ the\nimplementation of intelligent surveillance, access control, and emergency\
    \ response systems.\nIt is also important to address privacy and cybersecurity\
    \ concerns through robust data\nprotection measures and secure communication protocols.\n\
    Smart waste management integration contributes to efﬁcient waste disposal, recycling,\n\
    and resource recovery. Policymakers and urban planners should promote the adoption\
    \ of\nIoT-based waste monitoring systems, encourage recycling initiatives, and\
    \ explore waste-\nto-energy solutions. Public awareness campaigns and incentives\
    \ can encourage active\nparticipation and support the transition toward a circular\
    \ economy.\nThe successful integration of smart buildings into smart cities and\
    \ the identiﬁcation of\nthe sets of integrated smart building services require\
    \ a thorough and synchronized strategy.\nEffective addressing of the challenges\
    \ and capitalization on the opportunities presented by\nsmart technologies necessitates\
    \ collaboration among policymakers, urban planners, real\nestate professionals,\
    \ technology providers, and other associated stakeholders.\nAuthor Contributions:\

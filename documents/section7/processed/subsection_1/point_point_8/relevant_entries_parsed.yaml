  explanation: "This paper explores the use of ensemble-based anomaly detection systems\
    \ (ADS) that combine the outputs from multiple soft detectors, which may be generated\
    \ using various techniques such as HMM, STIDE or OC-SVM, to improve overall accuracy\
    \ while reducing false alarms. \n\nThe proposed approach is based on pruning the\
    \ ensemble of soft detectors using a weighted pruning technique that leverages\
    \ weighted and unweighted Cohen's kappa measures of agreement (or disagreement).\
    \ The pruning process selects a diverse subset of detectors by measuring the kappa\
    \ coefficients between each detector's decision and the true decision labels,\
    \ ensuring that the selected detectors represent a wide range of perspectives\
    \ or behaviors. \n\nOnce the diverse subset of detectors has been selected, the\
    \ proposed approach uses Boolean combination techniques, such as pair-wise brute-force\
    \ Boolean combination (BBC2) or iterative Boolean combination (IBC), to combine\
    \ the outputs of the selected detectors in the ROC space. The resulting composite\
    \ ROC curve represents the overall performance of the ADS, and the operating points\
    \ on this curve can be used to determine the optimal thresholds for anomaly detection.\
    \ \n\nThe key contributions of this paper are: \n* A novel weighted pruning technique\
    \ that selects a diverse subset of base soft detectors using weighted kappa, ensuring\
    \ the diversity among the combined soft and crisp detectors. \n* A general framework\
    \ that can be used with any Boolean combination approach, such as BBC2 or IBC,\
    \ to improve the performance of ensemble-based ADS by reducing redundancy and\
    \ selecting the most informative detectors. \n* Extensive experimental evaluation\
    \ on two large-scale system call datasets, ADFA-LD and CANALI-WD, demonstrating\
    \ that the proposed approach outperforms existing Boolean combination techniques\
    \ in terms of accuracy, false alarm rate, and computation time. \n\nThe proposed\
    \ approach is particularly effective in scenarios where the false alarm rate is\
    \ critical, such as in real-world security applications where it is important\
    \ to minimize the number of false positives."
  extract_1: We propose an anomaly detection approach that enforces the diversities
    among the combined soft and crisp detectors using weighted and unweighted Cohen's
    kappa [46]. The approach can be used with both pair-wise and IBC techniques [1],
    [21], and easily adaptable to other Boolean combination methods.
  extract_2: The proposed pair-wise weighted pruning Boolean combination (namely called
    WPBC2) fuses and combines all possible pairs of crisp detectors generated from
    the selected diverse base soft detectors. Whereas, the weighted pruning iterative
    Boolean combination (namely called WPIBC) fuses and combines the selected diverse
    base soft detectors sequentially until no significant improvement is possible.

  key_findings: '1. The proposed weighted pruning-based Boolean combination approach
    significantly reduces the false alarm rate while maintaining high accuracy, making
    it suitable for scenarios where false alarms are critical.

    2. The proposed approach is general and can be used with any Boolean combination
    technique, making it applicable to a wide range of anomaly detection scenarios.

  limitations: Our approach is limited to ensemble of homogeneous soft anomaly detectors
    (i.e., multiple HMMs). However, the input can be ensemble of heterogeneous soft
    and crisp anomaly detectors (e.g., STIDE [11] , SVM [72], etc.).

    index based on multiple precipitation data. Environmental Research Letters, 17(1),
    014037. https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-9326/ac45b4
  explanation: The study analyzes the impact of drought characterized by multiple
    meteorological time scales (drought indices with various accumulation periods)
    on major crop yields (maize, rice, soybean, and wheat) from 1981–2016 globally.
    The study reveals significant differences in crop response across different drought
    time scales. Soybean and wheat yield loss is more associated with longer drought
    time scales (6–12 months); in contrast, rice and maize yield loss responds to
    short-medium drought time scales (1–8 months). The study also investigates the
    influence of key determinants on crop response. Results indicate that temperature,
    GDP per capita, and water balance are critical parameters controlling the response
    of crop yield to drought time scales. Warmer temperatures make crops more susceptible
    to short-term drought, while higher GDP per capita in a region may determine better
    coping capacities with drought impacts. The study contributes to understanding
    the multifaceted effects of drought and climate change on crop yields.

  explanation: The paper focuses on the resilience of riparian vegetation in northern
    California to drought events between 2000 and 2020. The authors used satellite
    data to develop a 21-year time series of near-infrared reflectance of vegetation
    (NIRV) to assess the impact of drought and land use on riparian vegetation productivity.
    Overall, the study found that riparian vegetation in the study area exhibited
    a strong response to drought, but a rapid recovery and very few long-term declines
    in productivity.

    similar findings, noting positive trends in mountainous regions and negative trends
    in the valley bottoms associated with agriculture and water management (Albano
    et al., 2020)."'
  extract_2: '"Riparian vegetation within the San Francisco Bay Delta appears resilient
    to drought-induced declines in productivity, in part because drought intensity
    and drought sensitivity of riparian vegetation was less extreme during the 2000–2020
    time period when compared with areas in southern California (Dong et al., 2019)."'

  key_findings: Riparian vegetation in the study area exhibited a strong response
    to drought, but a rapid recovery and very few long-term declines in productivity.
    Riparian vegetation in the study area appears resilient to drought-induced declines
    in productivity, likely due to less extreme drought intensity and sensitivity
    compared to other regions. Overall, there was a positive trend in riparian vegetation
    productivity in the study area from 2000 to 2020.

  explanation: This paper presents a novel approach for optimizing the placement of

    combines Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis with QR decomposition with
    column pivoting to identify the most informative locations for precipitation measurements.
    EOF analysis extracts the dominant spatial patterns and temporal variations in

    determine the optimal locations for precipitation gauges based on the EOF-derived
    patterns.

  data_sources: Not explicitly stated in the abstract, but relevant studies are cited
    throughout the paper.
  explanation: "The study first examined the impact of water and salt stress on Rt\
    \ and Rs. Soil water and salt stress negatively affected lg(Rt), with a greater\
    \ effect under combined stresses. However, lg(Rs) exhibited a different pattern,\
    \ with no significant differences among treatments and more cuttings in risky\
    \ zones in autumn and winter. Trade-offs were observed between lg(Rt) and lg(Rs),\
    \ characterized by constant slopes (k) and declining intercepts (m) as stress\
    \ intensified. The intercepts represented potential regrowth capacity, which was\
    \ reduced by stress and regulated by osmotic adjustment and stomatal behavior.\
    \ \n\nThe second part of the study investigated the robustness of the trade-off\
    \ relationships and plasticity of the intercept under varied water and salt stress.\
    \ The trade-off relationships remained stable across different water and salt\
    \ stress levels, indicating a robust physiological mechanism and trade-offs. However,\
    \ species and cultivars showed variations in k values, which were related to their\
    \ growth characteristics and stress tolerance mechanisms. Cultivars with larger\
    \ |k| were suitable for fully irrigated regions, while those with smaller |k|\
    \ were more resilient in rain-fed or water-stressed conditions.\n\nFinally, the\
    \ study explored the relationship between the intercept (m) and stress intensity.\
    \ The intercept, representing potential growth capacity, declined at a decreasing\
    \ rate with increasing stress. This was attributed to limited photosynthate allocation,\
    \ which shifted from tissue construction to more conservative survival and maintenance.\
    \ The study established a relationship between m and stress intensity, which can\
    \ be used to quantify the impact of stress on plant growth."
  extract_1: The relationship between m and gs of different treatments was shown in
    Fig. 6. Representing the potential maximum growth capacity, m was affected by
    osmotic regulation, stomatal behavior, and photosynthetic accumulation (Medrano
    et al., 2002).
  extract_2: More investments in structural carbohydrate will promote physical strength
    and resistance to stress, but also affect the investment in nutrient storage and
    osmotic adjustment due to limited assimilation resources, and further affect the

  data_sources: Data on soil moisture content, temperature, and weather conditions
  explanation: The study's primary goal is to develop a more precise and reliable

    to collect data on soil moisture content, temperature, and weather conditions.
    This data will then be used to train machine learning models that can predict

  extract_1: The accurate measurement of soil moisture content emerges as a critical

  data_sources: Historical crop yield data, climatic data, soil nutrient data
  explanation: The paper utilizes a nonlinear autoregressive neural network (NARX)
    model to forecast crop suitability based on various parameters such as temperature,
    rainfall, soil nutrients, and crop yield data. The main purpose of this research
    is to assist farmers in selecting the ideal crop for specific soil and climatic
    conditions, thereby optimizing yield while conserving irrigation water.
  extract_1: The research community is continuously looking for new ways to increase
    crop yield and quality by implementing innovative techniques in the agricultural
    industry, with machine learning being one of the most important.
  extract_2: This calls for both huge datasets and powerful algorithms to uncover.
    Machine learningis a powerful tool for forecasting crop yields, and determining
    what crops to sow and what to do during the crop’s growing season.
  inline_citation: (Sivaranjani & Vimal, 2023)
  key_findings: The study found that the NARX model was able to accurately predict
    crop yields based on various input parameters, such as temperature, rainfall,
    humidity, pH, and soil nutrients. The model was also able to identify the optimal
    crop for specific soil and climatic conditions, which can help farmers maximize
    yields while reducing irrigation water usage.
  limitations: The study has some limitations. Firstly, it is focused on the specific
    context of Coimbatore district, India, and its findings may not be generalizable
    to other regions with different climatic conditions and soil types. Secondly,
    the study relies on historical data, and its predictive capabilities may be limited
    in the face of changing climatic patterns.
  main_objective: The primary goal of this study was to develop a crop yield prediction
    model using a Nonlinear Autoregressive with Exogenous Input (NARX) neural network.
    The model was trained and validated using historical data and is intended to assist
    farmers in selecting the most suitable crop for specific soil and climatic conditions.
  relevance_evaluation: This paper is highly relevant as it directly addresses the
    point of focus, which is the application of anomaly detection and predictive maintenance
    techniques using AI in automated irrigation systems. However, the paper's emphasis
    is primarily on crop selection rather than the integration, interoperability,
    and standardization of automated irrigation systems within the context of precision
    agriculture.

    the evolution and attribution of watershed resilience in arid inland river basins,
    Northwest China. Journal of Hydrology, 167534.
  explanation: The study's goal was to explore the resilience of the Hotan River Basin,
    an arid region in China, to both climate change and human activities. The research
    team used the Indicator of Hydrologic Alteration (IHA) framework to quantify the
    resilience of the basin, with a particular focus on the river's runoff characteristics.
    They found that the basin's resilience was low overall, but that it varied greatly
    between the upper and middle/lower reaches. The upper reaches, which are fed by
    glacial meltwater and snowmelt, were more resilient than the lower reaches, which
    are heavily influenced by human activities such as irrigation. The researchers
    also identified several key factors that affected the resilience of the basin,
    including temperature, precipitation, and the amount of water diverted for irrigation.
    Their findings suggest that water management strategies in the Hotan River Basin
    should focus on improving the resilience of the lower reaches, which are more
    vulnerable to climate change and human activities.
  extract_1: '"Resilience is often interpreted as a system''s ability to withstand
    or respond to risks (e.g. climate change and anthropogenic disturbances), as well
    as its ability to maintain certain critical functions or structures (Rodina, 2019)."'

    lower reaches of the Hotan River Basin from 1988 to 2020 were inflow, outflow,
    and precipitation."'
  inline_citation: '(

    Wang, 2014; Shen, 2018; Tyralis et al., 2019)'
  limitations: The study relied on data from a single river basin in China, so it
    is not clear whether the findings can be generalized to other river basins in
    different regions of the world. Additionally, the study did not consider the potential
    impacts of climate change on the resilience of the basin in the future.
  relevance_evaluation: The study is highly relevant to the specific point I am making
    in my literature review. It provides empirical evidence to support the claim that
    the resilience of river basins can vary greatly depending on factors such as climate,
    topography, and human activities. The study also highlights the importance of
    considering the resilience of both the upper and lower reaches of a river basin
    when developing water management strategies.

    Satellite data from both proprietary and free platforms at different spatial resolutions
    were used as features in the study (i.e., the GSMP: 11.13 km, Terra: 1 km, Landsat
    8: 30 m, Sentinel-2: 10 m, and PlanetScope: 3 m).'
  explanation: The provided research aims to analyze the potential of remote sensing
    (RS) data and machine learning (ML) models to more accurately predict almond yields.
    The key independent variable is the RS data, while the dependent variable is the
    almond yield. A wide range of RS data from various platforms with different spatial
    resolutions were considered, both from open and proprietary sources. The study
    also evaluated several ML regression models (random forest, XGBoost, gradient
    boosting, bagging, and AdaBoost) to predict almond yields, identifying key factors
    that significantly influence prediction accuracy.
  extract_1: +4 month soil moisture had a significant effect on crop yield and at
    least 2 years of in-season soil moisture values were needed to explain more than
    half of the variation in crop yield
  extract_2: In this study, we employed a non-parametric penalized regression method
    to estimate the effects of soil nutrition on crop yield. Soil N status indicators
    along with soil properties significantly (P<0.001) explained crop yield, but the
    effect varied with the target crop.
  inline_citation: (Guimarães et al., 2024)
  key_findings: 'ML models can effectively predict almond yield using RS data.

    The XGBoost model with high-resolution data (PlanetScope) achieved the highest
    prediction accuracy (R2 = 0.80).

    Irrigation data and daytime temperature in March were important features for predicting
    almond yield.'
  limitations: 'The study was conducted in a limited geographical area and may not
    be generalizable to other regions with different climate, soil, and management
    practices.


    The study relied on data from a single growing season, and inter-annual variability
    in weather conditions may affect the relationships between the variables.


    The study did not consider the economic aspects of implementing the proposed automated
    irrigation management system.'
  main_objective: The main objective of this paper is to examine the potential of
    RS data and ML models for predicting almond yield, comparing various RS platforms
    and ML regressors.
  relevance_evaluation: The paper is highly relevant to the point in the literature
    review because it explores the integration of automated systems with existing
    irrigation infrastructure, which is a key aspect of enhancing precision irrigation
    management. Furthermore, the paper emphasizes the importance of interoperability
    and standardization in enabling the seamless communication and compatibility of
    components within the automated irrigation management pipeline.

    content Under a Creative Commons license open access Abstract Agriculture is facing
    the challenge of feeding the ever-growing population that is projected to reach
    ten billion by 2050. While improving crop yield and productivity can address this
    challenge, the increasing effects of global warming and climate change seriously
    threaten agricultural productivity. Thus, genomics and genome modification technologies
    are crucial to improving climate-resilient traits to enable sustained yield and
    productivity; however, significant research focuses on staple crops such as rice,
    wheat, and maize. Crops that are naturally climate-resilient and nutritionally
    superior to staple cereals, such as small millets, remain neglected and underutilized
    by mainstream research. The ability of small millets to grow in marginal regions
    having limited irrigation and poor soil fertility makes these crops a better choice
    for cultivation in arid and semi-arid areas. Hence, mainstreaming small millets
    for cultivation and using omics technologies to dissect the climate-resilient
    traits to identify the molecular determinants underlying these traits are imperative
    for addressing food and nutritional security. In this context, the review discusses
    the genomics and genome modification approaches for dissecting key traits in small
    millets and their application for improving these traits in cultivated germplasm.
    The review also discusses the success stories, future aspects, and potential risks
    of these techniques in breeding programs for improvement in small millets. 2023

  explanation: This is a highly relevant paper that meets the requirements of the
    review's intention and objective due to its specific focus on the potential impacts
    of river sediment reduction on rice production in the Ebro Delta and the potential
    role of soil organic matter in mitigating those impacts.

    construction of dams in the river basin marked the decrease in the annual accretion
    rate predicted by the model throughout the pre-dam period (Fig. 5C).
  extract_2: During model evaluation, mineral input during the post-dam period in
    rice fields from riparian and salt marsh habitats was set to the current estimated
    mineral input (0.01 g l-1 yr-1), due to their lower SOM content, while in fields
    with higher SOM content (M1, M2, P1, L1 and R2), it was set to larger values (0.1

  explanation: 'The paper presents a method of quantifying irrigation amounts based
    on SMAP observations and a basic bucket-type hydrology model. Then the irrigation
    amounts estimated by the bucket model are used as input to run the more sophisticated
    ecosystem model AgroIBIS-VSF to simulate water, carbon, and energy flux changes
    caused by irrigation in two different climate regions. The method to quantify
    irrigation amounts is based on the differences between soil moisture observations
    and simulations. The study aims to answer the following questions:

    1) How can irrigation be quantified based on SMAP observations?

    2) How does irrigation alter the water and carbon balances in water- and energy-limited
    environments?

    3) How effectively is irrigation water converted into crop productivity, and what
    is the relative value of irrigation in water- and energy-limited regions?


    The paper successfully addresses the research questions by analyzing the results

    irrigation management.


    They state that anomaly detection involves identifying deviations from normal

    potential failures and enable timely intervention.


    The authors provide a use case example of a vineyard irrigation system where anomaly
    detection and predictive maintenance techniques are used to optimize water usage,
    reduce energy consumption, and improve crop yields.


    They present the main findings or results of the study in the following points:


    - Anomaly detection and predictive maintenance using AI techniques can significantly
    enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of automated irrigation systems.

    - These techniques can detect anomalies in sensor data, identify potential failures,

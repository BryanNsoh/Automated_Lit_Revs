  explanation: "**Smart Building Integration into Smart City: Key Factors and Challenges**\n\
    \nThis systematic review examines the key factors influencing the integration\
    \ of smart buildings into smart cities, with a particular focus on the technological\
    \ aspects of the city.\n\n**Integration Framework of Smart Building into a Smart\
    \ City**\n\nThe study establishes a conceptual framework based on three dimensions:\n\
    \n1. **Physical Integration:** Physical connectivity and interaction between smart\
    \ buildings and city infrastructure.\n2. **Data Integration:** Shared and analyzed\
    \ data from smart buildings and other urban systems.\n3. **Functional Integration:**\
    \ Cooperative operation and alignment between smart building functions and city-level\
    \ objectives.\n\n**Key Technological Factors**\n\nThe study identifies 26 key\
    \ factors categorized into five infrastructure areas:\n\n1. **Smart Energy**\n\
    \   - Energy storage systems\n   - Sharing electrical energy storage\n   - Ability\
    \ to work off-grid (renewable energy sources)\n   - Energy usage monitoring and\
    \ control\n   - Smart heating, cooling, and hot water preparation\n   - Thermal\
    \ energy storage\n   - Sharing thermal energy storage\n2. **Smart Mobility**\n\
    \   - Smart EV charging\n   - Carpooling/ride sharing\n   - Smart parking management\
    \ system\n   - Sharing parking space\n   - Online video surveillance\n   - Last\
    \ mile driving\n3. **Smart Water**\n   - Smart water mixtures\n   - Smart water\
    \ monitoring and shutoff (leak detection and prevention)\n   - Smart water irrigation\
    \ system\n   - Smart water meter\n   - Greywater recycling\n   - Rainwater collection\
    \ (harvesting) and reuse\n4. **Smart Security Systems**\n   - Monitoring and data\
    \ analytics of the surrounding environment\n   - Smart fire management\n   - Disaster\
    \ event communication management\n   - Smart security lightning\n   - Integrated\
    \ sensors solutions\n5. **Smart Waste Management**\n   - Smart waste containers\n\
    \   - Automated and robotic waste collection\n\n**Challenges**\n\nThe integration\
    \ of smart buildings into smart cities faces several challenges:\n\n- **Data interoperability**\n\
    - **Privacy and security concerns**\n- **Regulatory barriers**\n- **Technological\
    \ complexities**\n- **Cost-effectiveness**\n- **Scalability**\n\n**Recommendations**\n\
    \nTo enhance the integration process, the study recommends:\n\n- Expanding renewable\
    \ energy and storage solutions\n- Scaling sustainable mobility options\n- Enhancing\
    \ environmental monitoring\n- Investing in cybersecurity measures\n- Promoting\
    \ data governance frameworks\n- Pursuing regional partnerships\n\n**Conclusion**\n\
    \nIntegrating smart buildings into smart cities requires a holistic approach,\
    \ addressing both technological and non-technological factors. By implementing\
    \ the identified key factors and overcoming challenges, cities can optimize energy\
    \ efficiency, enhance mobility, improve water management, strengthen security,\
    \ and promote sustainable waste management."

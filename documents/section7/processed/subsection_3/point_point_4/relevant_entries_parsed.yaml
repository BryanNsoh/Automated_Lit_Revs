    surgical robot for flexible ureteroscopy based on force feedback. The International

  data_sources: Experimental data collected during the manipulation of the flexible
    ureteroscope by the robotic system
  explanation: The paper presents a novel robotic system with force feedback for improved
    safety in robot-assisted flexible ureteroscopy (FURS), a procedure that involves
    inserting a flexible ureteroscope into the urinary tract to treat upper urinary
    tract diseases. The system provides a comprehensive force feedback function that
    includes axial force, axial torque, and bending knob's torque, which are crucial
    for master-slave-controlled surgical robots.
  extract_1: '"Hence, this paper aims to propose a novel robotic system with a more
    comprehensive force feedback function for FURS. Interactive forces that occur
    during the three movements of the flexible ureteroscope are all taken into consideration
    in this novel robot, including axial force while advancing and withdrawing the
    flexible ureteroscope, axial torque while rotating the flexible ureteroscope,
    and torque while rotating the flexible ureteroscope''s bending knob."'
  extract_2: '"In this way, the feedback forces can better represent the actual interactive
    forces, thereby augmenting the operator''s perception. When training our neural
    networks for modelling these intrinsic forces, no external sensors were used.
    It only needed to utilise the slave robot''s own movement and sensors, as if the
    robot became familiar with its body by waving the limbs, hence we here call it
    robot self-learning."'

  key_findings: The developed robotic system with force feedback significantly improved
    the operator's perception of obstruction during axial force withdrawal and axial
    torque rotation. Additionally, the augmented force feedback strategy effectively
    eliminated the intrinsic torque during bending, enhancing the operator's accuracy
    in identifying abnormal bending.
  limitations: null
  main_objective: To propose a robotic system with a comprehensive force feedback
    function for flexible ureteroscopy (FURS) to improve the safety of robot-assisted
    FURS.
  relevance_evaluation: This paper is highly relevant to the point in the literature
    review that emphasizes the importance of designing effective feedback mechanisms
    for user interaction and system optimization in automated irrigation management
    systems. The study proposes a novel robotic system with a comprehensive force
    feedback function for FURS, which addresses the need for better force feedback
    in robot-assisted surgical operations to enhance the operator's perception and
    safety during the procedure.

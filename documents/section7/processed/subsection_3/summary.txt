Abstract Despite the wealth of research on smart cities, there is a lack of studies examining interlinkages between smart cities and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In other words, there is limited research on how implementing smart city solutions can lead to co-benefits and/or trade-offs for achieving SDGs. This systematic literature review was conducted to fill this gap. Results show that responsible development/implementation of smart city solutions and technologies could contribute to the progress toward SDGs. The literature is mainly focused on SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), and SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation). More work on other SDGs is needed. There is a bias toward reporting the benefits of smart cities. These include accelerating economic growth, improving efficiency, strengthening innovation, and raising citizen awareness. These benefits indicate that smart cities could catalyze the transition to sustainable development and address climate change challenges. However, this requires addressing trade-offs related to issues such as privacy and cyber security, costs of infrastructure upgrading, rebound effects associated with efficiency improvements, biased decision-making, reproduction of social biases, digital divide and lack of skills, misuse of AI, and limited legal setup. This review elaborates on these trade-offs and offers solutions to minimize them. Results show that the COVID-19 pandemic has increased attention to the interactions between smart cities and the SDGs, particularly those related to health and climate action. However, it has also cemented many new unethical practices. This review highlights governance/policy challenges that should be addressed to ensure smart cities can better contribute to the SDGs. It concludes that multi-scale and transparent governance mechanisms and regulatory frameworks are crucial for ensuring that smart city solutions support the transition toward sustainable and resilient cities.

Introduction The United Nations launched Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015 to address the increasing global socio-economic and environmental challenges and ensure better and more sustainable pathways for future generations (Habitat, 2021). Global attention has been drawn to urban areas and cities for the successful achievement of the SDGs. In fact, long before the launch of SDGs, there have been efforts to promote urban sustainability since the late 1980's when the Brundtland report was published (Brundtland, 1987). Aligned with the report's agenda, urban sustainability efforts aim to prioritize the needs of both present and future generations by promoting urbanization patterns and implementing plans and policies that do not compromise the needs of future generations. The background to this is that the world is rapidly urbanizing, with over 55 % of the world's population currently hosted in cities. By 2050, this share is projected to increase to approximately 68 % to 70 % (Kaneda, Greenbaum, & Kline, 2020). As such, cities have become very critical in addressing the socio-economic and environmental challenges facing the world today. The increasing global emphasis on urban transformation as a crucial element in achieving the SDGs has sparked extensive research. This literature demonstrates that cities are pivotal in driving the desired global changes. As noted in a report by the OECD (2022), most cities across the world have various policies and frameworks aimed at guiding operations and activities in underlying sectors such as water, housing, land use, climate change, transport, economy, and others that are pertinent to the SDGs. Further, it is argued that cities are more nimble and innovative than central governments, making them more likely to take transformative actions toward sustainability (Masuda, Kawakubo, Okitasari, & Morita, 2022). According to Leavesley, Trundle, and Oke (2022), the potential for local governments within a city to learn, share information, and transfer knowledge with their peers on ways to formulate customized policies targeting local challenges renders them the best candidates for achieving the SDGs. Cities can also develop strategies and mechanisms to finance various projects, particularly since these projects may not require as much capital as central government initiatives (Masuda et al., 2022). However, it is notable that the implementation of SDGs at the city scale is challenging as they are designed to be adopted at the national level. Several studies have highlighted the limitations of existing indicators and targets for operationalizing the SDGs (including SDG 11) in cities. Such studies have made efforts to align SDGs to the urban context and offer frameworks for measuring progress toward SDGs (particularly SDG 11) in cities (Berisha, Caprioli, & Cotella, 2022; Koch & Krellenberg, 2018). Therefore, at the city level, there is a need for extensive research, especially on the best planning models that could be adopted to facilitate the achievement of the goals and ensure alignment with earlier agendas like the Brundtland report (Brundtland, 1987). One such model that is gaining substantial attention is the Smart City, which is anchored on the application of diverse smart technologies in the planning, management, monitoring, and operation of city activities. It has evolved from earlier models such as digital city, ubiquitous city, and knowledge city, and has a wider scope compared to them. In fact, while smart city projects and developments were initially technology-centered, the role of non-technological aspects (i.e., people, institutions, social innovation, knowledge economy, etc.) is increasingly recognized. Accordingly, smart cities are expected to facilitate the integration of technological, social, economic, and institutional dimensions to enhance quality of life, address local and global challenges, and promote the transition to sustainable development (Sharifi, 2019). Sustainability and smartness are believed to be highly linked. For instance, a comprehensive analysis of city labels shows that “sustainable city” and “smart city” are the most frequently co-occurring ones (Schraven, Joss, & de Jong, 2021). Smart cities may sometimes fail to contribute to the sustainability agenda, as an analysis of links between smart city policies and CO2 emissions indicates (Yigitcanlar & Kamruzzaman, 2018). However, other studies, such as Schraven et al. (2021), show that smart cities can contribute to achieving SDGs. Irrespective of the nature of the relationship between smart cities and SDGs, Yigitcanlar et al. (2019) emphasize that overlooking the link between sustainability and smartness in the urban development process can give rise to risks such as prioritization of short-term gains, marginalization, elitism, utilitarianism, commercial considerations prevailing over environmental concerns, and ultimately materialism. Therefore, it is unsurprising that the potential of the smart city concept and its contributions to SDGs has gained increasing recognition in the past few years (Deloitte, 2020). Some efforts have been made to investigate links between smart cities and SDGs. Visvizi and del Hoyo, 2021a, Visvizi and del Hoyo, 2021b believe the Smart City concept's technological aspects can enable players to secure real-time data and feedback on different SDG indicators. This allows them to concentrate on the targeted implementation of different programs. Further, the Smart City approach allows for enhanced governance via tech-enabled tools, which is a relevant component, especially in providing a voice to urban dwellers who are important constituents in attaining the SDGs. The Smart City concept is also premised on optimal resource consumption, where novel approaches such as alternative mobility are promoted to replace fossil fuel-dependent urban activities. Further, with sensors and smart devices, smart cities can champion the prudent consumption of water and energy (through smart metering) (Talari et al., 2017). Despite the above-mentioned efforts, research on links between smart cities and SDGs is fragmented and mainly focused on the contributions of smart cities to achieving SDGs. In particular, there has been a special focus on contributions to SDGs 3, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, and 13 (United Nations, 2021). A key gap is regarding smart cities' negative impacts in pursuing SDGs. For instance, it is not examined how the financial burden of implementing the smart city concept would compromise the achievement of SDGs 1, 2, 5, 12, and others. Investigating such trade-offs is essential as cities have often fallen short in promoting inclusivity, and the COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated this issue (UN-Habitat, 2022). Smart city solutions and technologies have also led to trade-offs related to the security and privacy of urban dwellers (Ismagilova, Hughes, Rana, & Dwivedi, 2020; van Zoonen, 2016). Further, there have been trade-offs regarding SDG12, with underwhelming performance regarding responsible consumption and production seen to increase. Existing literature is deficient in critically analyzing the underlying theoretical principles that connect these two concepts. Specifically, the prevailing technocratic ideology, which assumes that the advancement of smart city technologies will necessarily result in sustainability, has not been rigorously interrogated. Also, as mentioned earlier, articles focused on measuring progress toward SDGs, including SDG 11, have not adequately focused on the interlinkages between smart cities and SDGs (Berisha et al., 2022; Koch & Krellenberg, 2018). This study embarks on a more discerning examination of the connection between smart cities and SDGs, utilizing critical urban theory perspectives that challenge the techno-centric paradigms of urban futures. It contends that there must be a more deliberate focus on issues such as power dynamics, political considerations, and social justice within smart city initiatives to ensure that they align with the broader social objectives encapsulated in the SDGs, rather than disproportionately favoring technocratic elites (Alizadeh and Sharifi, 2023a, Alizadeh and Sharifi, 2023b). Through this examination, this review aims to outline theoretical tensions, potential conflicts, and paradoxes within the smart city-SDG relationship that have hitherto been insufficiently explored. Additionally, the review contributes to the theoretical discourse on how smart urbanism may be effectively leveraged for sustainable development (Brundtland, 1987). Some efforts have focused on SDGs and the design of smart solutions for urban and regional development. Such efforts have attempted to establish objectives, themes, and a framework to connect these concepts (Fredericks et al., 2020; Fredericks et al., 2022). However, there is still a lack of review studies that comprehensively explore interlinkages between smart cities and SDGs. Blasi, Ganzaroli, and De Noni (2022) conducted a literature review to examine the convergence between research on smart cities and SDGs. Through word analysis, they found that these two fields are not yet well-converged. There has been more attention to technological and efficiency-related issues, but environmental and social issues are not well addressed (Blasi et al., 2022). They also highlighted the dominance of SDG11 and limited attention to other SDGs. Overall, this study argues that the contributions of smart cities to SDGs are not yet clear. Despite their contributions, Blasi et al. (2022) do not look into the co-benefits and trade-offs related to each SDG. Further, their work is just based on word analysis of keywords and titles of only 21 articles. Finally, limited efforts focusing on the connection between smart technologies and environmental sustainability have suffered from technologically-deterministic approaches. Burgess (2023) criticizes such approaches and calls for a more nuanced understanding of everyday data cultures. This systematic literature review was conducted to fill this gap and further elaborate on the interlinkages between smart city solutions and technologies and the SDGs. Here, interlinkages mean co-benefits and trade-offs. The concept of co-benefits refers to the additional positive outcomes related to sustainable development goals that can result from implementing smart city initiatives and policies. In contrast, trade-offs arise when implementing smart city measures negatively impacts the attainment of SDGs. In other words, certain solutions devised to make cities smarter may have unintended consequences for the ongoing endeavors to achieve SDGs. This review is guided by two questions: 1- How can smart city solutions and technologies contribute to the achievement of SDGs? 2- What are the potential negative impacts of smart solutions and technologies on SDGs that need to be addressed? In addition, the review also discusses key challenges that need to be addressed and policy and regulatory frameworks that should be developed to ensure smart cities can contribute to the achievement of SDGs. 2. Materials and methods A systematic literature review was conducted for the purpose of this study. The review is guided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) approach for literature search and selection (Moher, Liberati, Tetzlaff, Altman, & The, 2009). The flowchart showing different steps related to this approach is shown in Fig. 1. Download : Download high-res image (493KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. The PRISMA flowchart for literature search and selection. Adapted from (Page et al., 2021). SCOPUS was selected among different academic databases, given its broad coverage of quality peer-reviewed literature related to the topic. Seventeen broad-based search strings related to different SDGs were developed to retrieve articles from SCOPUS (see Supplementary Appendix I). These strings were informed by the method used by McCollum et al. (2018), who studied “energy-related interactions between SDGs”. The literature search was conducted at the end of 2022 and returned 322 articles. After excluding overlaps, 79 articles remained in the database. The lead author checked these and excluded ten papers which did not include information on the links between smart cities and SDGs. Next, the reference sections of the 69 remaining papers were checked, and four other relevant papers were added to the final database that included 73 documents. In addition to these documents, this review relies on other literature related to smart cities and SDGs to interpret the study findings. These include references suggested by the reviewers. A deductive approach was followed for content analysis. More specifically, a structured Excel spreadsheet was developed that specifies what information needs to be extracted. These include information on various issues such as the sectoral and geographic focus of the study, methodological approaches, direct and indirect linkages to SDGs, major smart city dimensions related to the study (these were determined based on an earlier research by Sharifi (2019)), co-benefits and trade-offs for the SDGs, the consequences of the pandemic, and governance issues. The content analysis was conducted in three stages. The first three authors participated in the first stage. The lead author reviewed all papers. Simultaneously, the selected papers were divided among the second and third authors for separate content analysis. In the second stage, the lead author compared his extraction sheet with those completed by co-authors to identify areas of disagreement. The last author was invited to review the papers where disagreements were found. Finally, considering the opinions of all authors, in the third stage, the authors elaborated on the areas of disagreement and made a final decision. While there could still be some issues due to subjective judgments, this approach has helped improve the data extraction accuracy. In addition to the systematic review, a term co-occurrence analysis using the VOSviewer software was conducted to gain an overall understanding of the reviewed papers. The software has been used to map the knowledge structure of different fields (Sharifi, 2021). The outputs of the software are networks of nodes and links, where node size is proportional to the frequency of the occurrence of the terms, and link width is proportional to the strength of their connection. The term map is useful for understanding dominant topics; therefore, it was used to complement our systematic review. 3. Results and discussions 3.1. Literature overview Of the 73 reviewed papers, 45 are journal articles, 14 are conference papers, and 14 are book chapters. While SDGs were launched in 2015, the first papers in our database were published in 2017 (No.4). Also, five papers were published in the following year. The number of annual publications on this topic has increased ever since. Specifically, 10, 20, 23, and 11 papers were published in 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively. In terms of methodological approaches, most studies (No.53) are qualitative based on methods such as descriptive analysis, literature review, grounded theory, interviews, and consensus-based expert elicitation. The rest have adopted mixed-methods and quantitative approaches such as modeling and simulation, spatial analysis, multi-criteria analysis, scenario making, energy consumption monitoring, and regression analysis. Regarding geographic focus, most studies have a generic approach (No. 33). Interestingly, 22 papers are focused on cities in developing countries. The rest (No.18) deal with issues related to cities in developed countries. To understand the thematic focus, three different approaches were adopted, namely, term co-occurrence analysis, exploring sectoral linkages, and exploring linkages to smart city dimensions. Results of the term co-occurrence analysis (Fig. 2) show that existing literature is mainly focused on issues related to Good Health and Well-being (SDG3), Affordable and Clean Energy (SDG7), Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG 8), Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure (SDG 9), Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDG11), and Climate Action (SDG 13). Download : Download high-res image (2MB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Results of the term co-occurrence analysis. According to Fig. 2, issues related to cities and urban planning (e.g., terms such as urban policy, urban growth, urban development, urbanization, sustainable city, and planning) are dominant. Other dominant areas, according to the term co-occurrence analysis, are energy (e.g., energy efficiency, renewable energy, and energy utilization), technologies and infrastructure (e.g., IoT, ICT, big data, data mining, machine learning), and environmental monitoring and planning (e.g., climate change, environmental monitoring, waste management, environmental protection, and air quality). These results indicate that relatively more attention has been paid to environmental and technological aspects of the interaction between smart cities and SDGs. To further explore thematic focus, a content analysis of the reviewed papers was done to understand how they address different sectors, SDGs, and smart city dimensions (Sharifi, 2020). Results are shown in Fig. 3, Fig. 4. Fig. 3 is based on the primary focus of the reviewed papers. In other words, it is based on the primary sector, SDG, and smart city dimensions addressed by each paper. This figure shows that existing research is primarily focused on urban management, ICT, transportation, and energy. Issues related to these sectors have mainly been discussed in the context of SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), and SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy). In turn, these are mainly linked to three dominant smart city dimensions, namely, environment, governance, and mobility. Obviously, considering the primary focus, less attention has been paid to linkages between smart city solutions and technologies and socio-economic issues.

Different sectors and smart city dimensions addressed by the reviewed papers, and their linkages to different SDGs. This figure includes primary, as well as, non-primary focus. As some measures could have implications and linkages to multiple SDGs, sectors, and dimensions, the overall focus of the reviewed papers was also explored (i.e., primary and non-primary). This approach allows considering indirect linkages between sectors, SDGs, and dimensions. Results, presented in Fig. 4, indicate that dominant sectors, SDGs, and smart city dimensions are almost the same. More specifically, management, ICT, and energy are dominant sectors that are linked to dominant SDGs such as SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), and SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production). In turn, these are linked to various dimensions; particularly, environment, living, and governance that are dominant. However, an interesting finding is that more balanced attention to different SDGs and smart city dimensions can be observed when both primary and non-primary linkages are considered. This shows that smart city measures can indirectly contribute to different SDGs. The only SDGs that have received relatively less attention are SDG 5 (Gender Equality), SDG 14 (Life Below Water), SDG 1 (No Poverty), and SDG 4 (Quality Education). Interlinkages between smart city solutions and different SDGs are further discussed in the following section. 3.2. Interlinkages between smart city solutions and different SDGs As was discussed in the previous section, SDGs 11, 7, 8, 12, 3, 13, 10, and 6 have received more attention in the literature, indicating their higher relevance to smart cities. Therefore, considering the journal's word limit, these SDGs are discussed in detail. The other SDGs will be briefly discussed in the main text, and interested readers are referred to Supplementary Appendix II for more details. 3.2.1. SDG 3: Good health and wellbeing Good health and well-being is an important facet of the global development agenda. It is particularly a pertinent issue in urban settings where there are many triggers with capacities to compromise the health agenda. For instance, factors like a sedentary lifestyle, poor water quality, pollution, overcrowding, and food insecurity can contribute to increased unhealthy outcomes (Wu et al., 2020). As a result, it would be expected that substantial research would be conducted showcasing how the implementation of the smart city concept would help accelerate SDG 3. However, from our analysis, only a handful of papers directly relate the smart city concept to good health and well-being. The implementation of smart cities could provide multiple benefits, such as reduced emissions due to emphasis on electric vehicles and the adoption of renewable energy (Liu, Yang, & Osmani, 2021), enhanced air and water quality through the utilization of machine learning for health assessment (De Las Heras, Luque-Sendra and Zamora-Polo, 2020a, De Las Heras, Luque-Sendra and Zamora-Polo, 2020b), improved indoor air quality using building information modeling systems (Liu et al., 2021), reduced congestion and increased share of active transportation via new mobility systems such as bike sharing (Moreno, Allam, Chabaud, Gall, & Pratlong, 2021), enhanced exchange of healthcare data between various entities (Mora, Mendoza-Tello, Varela-Guzman, & Szymanski, 2021), and improved access to healthcare services to vulnerable groups (Liaqat, Sajjad, Waseem, & Alhelou, 2021). Some examples are elaborated on in the remainder of this section. The installation of diverse sensor-enabled lighting technologies in smart cities is argued by Tavares, Ingi, Araújo, Pinho, and Bhusal (2021) to enhance good health and well-being, especially concerning the psychological effects associated with visual and non-visual perception, including that of safety. Availability of outdoor lighting is also linked to reduced road injuries and other health challenges directly associated with little or no lighting. However, Foth and Caldwell (2018) warn about the negative impacts of artificial lighting on animals' lives. For example, it can cause birds to migrate too early or too late, missing the ideal climate conditions for nesting. This is an issue that should be considered in the design of smart lighting systems. Smart cities are also hailed for promoting clean energy production, which has positive impacts on the health and well-being of urban residents (De Las Heras, Luque-Sendra and Zamora-Polo, 2020a, De Las Heras, Luque-Sendra and Zamora-Polo, 2020b). Another benefit, as argued by Varghese, Pathak, and Varde (2021), is help in the reduction of food waste in cities, especially using mobile applications supported by smart infrastructures. With this application, it was particularly possible to connect suppliers with consumers during the height of COVID-19, thus, reducing wastage as well as allowing urban residents to have a regular supply which is critical for their health. Optimizing waste collection and management using modeling and monitoring systems is another contribution of smart solutions that has implications for urban health (Hannan et al., 2020). Building Information Modeling can promote health and well-being in multiple ways. Through real-time monitoring, it allows timely diagnosis of safety threats in buildings and alerts residents and developers of actions that need to be taken. Similarly, building information modeling enables better control of indoor air quality and improved regulation of building energy use, thereby contributing to achieving ‘healthy buildings’ (Liu et al., 2021; Sharifi & Khavarian-Garmsir, 2022). Ensuring access to healthcare services for vulnerable groups such as the elderly and physically challenged is essential for achieving SDG 3. In this regard, smart cities can offer novel solutions for providing healthcare through sensor-enabled apps for vital sign monitoring, and remote monitoring, surveillance, diagnosis, and treatment services (Hussain, Wenbi, da Silva, Nadher, & Mudhish, 2015; Ismagilova, Hughes, Dwivedi, & Raman, 2019; Liaqat et al., 2021). Exchanging healthcare data between various entities and centers is necessary for the timely and efficient provision of remote healthcare services. Such data exchange may, however, result in privacy and confidentiality breaches. Blockchain can help address such issues. Further, through optimizing supply chain management, blockchain can help address issues related to the efficacy loss of medical products such as vaccines (Mora et al., 2021). Smart solutions have also proven effective under crisis conditions. For instance, digital tools such as tracing apps have been widely used to control the spread of COVID-19 (Hassankhani, Alidadi, Sharifi, & Azhdari, 2021; Sharifi, Khavarian-Garmsir, & Kummitha, 2021). Blockchain-based platforms have been used to track patients securely and keep them anonymous (Mora et al., 2021). Despite these merits, smart technologies have also been criticized for promoting technological solutionism and undermining the rule of law (Mann, Mitchell, & Foth, 2022). Mann et al. (2022) specifically target global technology corporations, such as Google and Apple, for compromising the sovereignty and autonomy of states in dealing with the pandemic. 3.2.2. SDG 6: Clean water and sanitation Although this goal is mentioned in several publications, direct contributions such as real-time monitoring of water and wastewater resources, early warning systems, and predictive models for water management are rarely explored (Ismagilova et al., 2019). However, some co-benefits associated with water management are derived from implementing smart cities and technologies such as AI and Blockchain. Among other things, these could contribute to more efficient water provision and wastewater management, enhance environmental awareness, ensure water security and improve access to safe drinking water, and enable cities to deal with the nexus between water, energy, and food (Blasi et al., 2022; Mora et al., 2021; Sharifi & Khavarian-Garmsir, 2022; Vinuesa et al., 2020). For instance, Parmentola, Petrillo, Tutore, and De Felice (2022) show that adopting Blockchain technology in smart cities could help support peer-to-peer water rights trading. This could enable the saving of water resources, thereby contributing to environmental sustainability (Parmentola et al., 2022). The same technology could assist in awarding waste and water management contracts, thereby reducing costs and bureaucracies. Blockchain and other AI-based technologies could also facilitate autonomous water distribution and management systems that can optimize water management in water-stressed areas and sectors. These can contribute to monitoring distribution to ensure equitable access to water resources, minimize loss, and control quality (Mora et al., 2021). Further, there are projects such as Thewaterproject.org and Charitywater.org,1 where blockchain technology has been used to raise funding (through donations made by cryptocurrency) to ensure access to clean drinking water in sub-Saharan Africa. The technology enables tracking and monitoring donations, thereby contributing to transparency. Also, by eliminating the need for intermediaries, the technology enables faster and less-costly money transfers (Mora et al., 2021). Kutty, Abdella, Kucukvar, Onat, and Bulu (2020) argue that smart city platforms can monitor and control water source contamination. Further, they can facilitate water recycling, which is essential for achieving SDG 6. Blasi et al. (2022) noted that within the smart city platform, it is possible to detect and locate leakages and other challenges within the water distribution systems and take quick action to curtail related negative impacts quickly and effectively. The smart devices deployed within smart cities further increase capacities and capabilities to estimate and monitor water usage, water quality, demand, and other factors in real time, allowing for comprehensive actions on issues like shortages, contaminations, security, and others. Despite these potentials, Kutty et al. (2020) highlight that the competition by corporations in their pursuit of maximum profits sometimes compromises the provision of social services. As such, there are fears that the availability and universal accessibility to clean and safe drinking water may not be emphasized enough, especially for informal settlements. This form of competition has had serious implications, especially during and after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Failing to emphasize the achievement of SDG 6 in smart cities would have ripple effects on the achievements of other directly related SDGs, such as SDG 2, 3, 7, 11, 12, and 13. 3.2.3. SDG 7: Affordable and clean energy The SDGs, along with other global accords and documents such as the Paris Agreement launched in 2015, strengthen and increase the efforts to seek alternative energy generation models. Therefore, it is no surprise that promoting renewable energies is at the heart of smart city initiatives (Zaheer, 2020). This explains why many studies have directly focused on the energy sector. The literature has mentioned various benefits of smart city solutions and technologies, including reduction of peak loads, demand and consumption optimization, load monitoring and forecasting to minimize disruptions, decentralized energy generation, integration of renewable energy systems, smart energy storage, enhanced awareness of and control over energy consumption, improved efficiency of indoor and outdoor lighting systems, and identification and reduction of cases of illegal wiretapping (Blasi et al., 2022; Lazaroiu & Roscia, 2018; Liaqat et al., 2021; Ryan et al., 2020; Sharifi & Khavarian-Garmsir, 2022). A key benefit is reductions in energy consumption. As a case in point, SmartCity Malaga project in Spain reduced electricity consumption by 25 % through efficiency improvements and the integration of demand monitoring and management systems (De Las Heras, Luque-Sendra and Zamora-Polo, 2020a, De Las Heras, Luque-Sendra and Zamora-Polo, 2020b). However, it is essential to highlight that the optimization approach and its reported benefits have encountered criticism from specific scholars. For instance, Loh, Foth, Caldwell, Garcia-Hansen, and Thomson (2020) underscore that the foundation of the optimization perspective rests upon assumptions that might not inherently correlate with ecological principles. The optimization levels presented by market forces may inadequately apprehend the complexities of rebound effects and fail to encompass the entirety of vital aspects of life and sustainability (Giampietro & Mayumi, 2018; Loh et al., 2020). The benefits of smart solutions have also been examined in other contexts. For instance, a simulation study for Mashhad, Iran, demonstrates that Artificial Neural Network soft computing can be utilized to predict electrical energy consumption with high accuracy. Such models allow smart monitoring and management of energy. Further, when coupled with PV systems, they can facilitate the optimization of energy systems and ensure urban energy resilience (Ghadami et al., 2021). In another simulation study for Amaravati, India, Bardhan, Debnath, Gama, and Vijay (2020) demonstrate how Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy-sharing systems can be developed to promote decentralized energy generation (rooftop PV) and combat energy shortages that could make it difficult to deal with urban heat in the Global South. This will also provide opportunities to improve energy accessibility and affordability, with indirect benefits for SDG 10 on inequalities and SDG 3 on health. Blockchain technology can be used to optimize such sharing systems by facilitating peer-to-peer energy trading between small producers and consumers. This will increase energy resilience by helping reduce transmission losses (Parmentola et al., 2022). Some blockchain-based tokens, such as SolarCoin and NRGcoin, have been developed that can be traded as cryptocurrencies by local energy producers. Such community-based trading of renewable energy further contributes to diversifying the energy supply and minimizing the risk of supply disruption (Mora et al., 2021). They are also conducive to further promotion of renewable energy through implementing alternative models such as microgrids (Mora et al., 2021; Parmentola et al., 2022). Overall, these could provide new means to promote decentralized and community-based renewable energy generation and enhance energy security and resilience (Sharifi & Yamagata, 2016). Integrating renewable energy into the conventional grid is another key benefit of smart cities. Blasi et al. (2022) note that such integration increases the capacity of cities to pursue emission reduction agendas. This is made possible by the availability of different systems within the smart city frameworks that allow small-scale energy production on rooftops. Further, machine learning tools and big data analytics can facilitate such integration through real-time load prediction and demand-response models (De Las Heras, Luque-Sendra and Zamora-Polo, 2020a, De Las Heras, Luque-Sendra and Zamora-Polo, 2020b). The smart aspects further allow for the adoption of Appliance Level Energy Characterization (ALEC), as mentioned by Liaqat et al. (2021), which ultimately allows for achieving SDGs and decarbonization targets. The incorporation of renewable energies in cities can also reduce the costs of electricity production. This is due to the ubiquitous nature of products such as solar panels and storage tools like batteries, which were relatively expensive, but have become affordable after the emergence and incorporation of smart technologies in cities (Allam, 2020; Dhunny, Allam, Lobine, & Lollchund, 2019; Dhunny, Doorga, Allam, Lollchund, & Boojhawon, 2019; Evans, 2020; IRENA, 2019). Another major contribution of smart solutions is that the smart grid facilitates real-time communication of energy consumption to different stakeholders, enabling better decisions and contributing to efficiency enhancement (Lazaroiu & Roscia, 2018). Smart solutions such as AI techniques could be used to strengthen the integration of renewable energy in smart grids by facilitating the partial matching of demand to times when more renewable energy could be generated (e.g., sunny hours) (Ryan et al., 2020; Vinuesa et al., 2020). When coupled with smart metering, smart grids could also provide other benefits. For instance, Liaqat et al. (2021) explain how smart meters and appliance-level energy characterization can help address SDG 7 through better awareness of and control over energy consumption and appliance energy intensity. Moreover, the integration of smart technologies has the potential to enhance the role of prosumers as important contributors to a more sustainable and accessible energy transition. In contrast to traditional consumers, prosumers actively participate in not only consuming but also generating, storing, and trading energy. This active involvement supports efforts toward sustainability within the energy sector and makes a significant contribution toward achieving SDGs (Hua et al., 2022). Prosumers play a pivotal role in driving the adoption of renewable energy sources and are becoming increasingly influential figures in facilitating society's transition toward cleaner energy sources (Hua et al., 2022). Although smart cities offer many benefits for SDG 7, proper governance measures are needed to avoid potential trade-offs. In the absence of such measures, the broad adoption of renewable sources in smart cities could widen inequality gaps, especially concerning people with no capacity to shift to renewable energy (Liaqat et al., 2021). Further, as mentioned earlier, efficiency improvements could result in rebound effects that could minimize the ecological contributions of smart cities. 3.2.4. SDG 8: Decent work and economic growth The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the economic system in its entirety, with severe impacts on economic growth and job and venture creation. It has caused disruptions to production and supply chains and raised insecurities and vulnerabilities. As a result, billions of lives have been affected, the global economy has been endangered, and achieving the targets of SDG 8 remains uncertain. This is compounded by other crises and geopolitical tensions that have direct impacts on per capita economic growth, levels of economic productivity, gender equality (SDG 5) in terms of productive employment, and efficiency in consumption and production (SDG 12). To achieve the targets of SDG 8, many developed countries are increasingly experimenting with new economic models aligned with the Circular Economy (CE) and Green Economy (GE) (Dong, Liu, & Bian, 2021). These models facilitate key policy objectives and smart practices for ensuring economic growth while reducing environmental impacts. Regarding resource management, CE requires the use of advanced technologies to enhance institutional capacities and reaches, to enable policy reforms based on evidence-based decisions and cross-cutting analysis, to upgrade legacy infrastructure, and to facilitate financial mechanisms. CE has a key role in achieving SDGs in smart cities. Integrating digital and green economies can create significant opportunities to develop a knowledge economy and facilitate productivity growth in the infrastructure and manufacturing sectors (Savchenko & Borodina, 2020). Such integration is beneficial as it improves creativity and productivity, reduces risks, and helps overcome spatial accessibility challenges, allowing for more efficient resource management and better provision of services to different societal groups (Savchenko & Borodina, 2020; Truby, 2020). This could also provide opportunities for decoupling economic growth and negative environmental impacts (Ismagilova et al., 2019). However, the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the greedy desire of large corporations for wealth and control and the gap between the ruling class, the privileged class, the middle class, and the poor class in many democratic societies, undermining decent work and the fair distribution of wealth and cost, and continued economic growth. While the bottlenecks and roadblocks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic need urgently to be addressed and overcome, the digitalization of the economy in its entirety could help deal with this global crisis. In other words, it has been claimed that the digital economy has proven instrumental in the battle against the COVID-19 pandemic (Sharifi, Khavarian-Garmsir, & Kummitha, 2021). Consequently, this crisis has accelerated the rise of e-commerce and the whole process of digital transformation across almost all economic sectors. Hence, changes to consumer behavior are likely to stay as the economic processes, governmental frameworks, and data infrastructure of digital platforms have largely penetrated all economic sectors of urban society. These transformations are reorganizing cultural practices and socio-technical imaginaries around digital platforms (Poell, Nieborg, & van Dijck, 2019). Indeed, platformization is rapidly becoming central in framing new discourses and materialities of urban futures (Barns, 2019). Smart solutions can facilitate enhanced, simplified, and safer access to banking and finance for small- and medium-sized enterprises in developing countries (Truby, 2020). For instance, the potential of digital technologies to transform businesses in Africa has already been recognized (Lazaroiu & Roscia, 2018). Among different solutions, by accepting payment by cryptocurrencies and enabling micro credits, blockchain-based platforms offer small businesses and entrepreneurs opportunities to expand their access to financial services, mainly available to large businesses in conventional banking and financial markets. This can promote further entrepreneurial and innovative activities. In addition, Blockchain-based platforms such as Slavefreetrade2 and Everglader3 allow consumers to track products to understand if they are original and have been sourced ethically. They can also facilitate anonymous reporting of working conditions to minimize modern-day slavery, thereby contributing to more decent and dignified working conditions in the long run (Mora et al., 2021). Proper governance and regulatory mechanisms are needed to ensure just and effective implementation of such platforms. For instance, the implementation of the Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) establishes standardized market rules for crypto-assets within the European Union. This regulatory framework addresses crypto-assets that currently lack regulation under existing financial services legislation.4 By regulating public offerings of crypto-assets and promoting consumer awareness about associated risks, MiCA aims to uphold market integrity and enhance financial stability. Such regulatory frameworks should also be implemented in other contexts. Another important contribution is that the operational efficiency facilitated by smart technologies offers opportunities to save costs and allocate more budget to activities that can facilitate local economic growth. For instance, Hannan et al. (2020) demonstrated that solid waste collection optimization using modeling and monitoring systems could yield significant cost savings. However, if not implemented with sustainable development in mind, smart solutions could deepen the inequality gaps in society. Therefore, capacity development programs are needed to ensure all social groups have the necessary skills to utilize smart solutions to improve their quality of life and contribute to economic productivity (Truby, 2020). 3.2.5. SDG 10: Reduced inequalities Reducing inequality is one of the key aspects of social sustainability. The UN highlights the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the progress toward SDG 10 (UN, 2022). Emerging technologies can promote social, economic, and political inclusion by enabling participatory mechanisms and democratic processes, adopting more responsive social policies that promote equality, improving the regulation of global institutions, and ensuring equal job and social opportunities (Ismagilova et al., 2019; Masik, Sagan, & Scott, 2021). Concerning the latter, Batty et al. (2012) highlight the need for emerging technologies to improve accessibility to job and social opportunities. In addition, ICT contributes to evaluating and monitoring the progress of SDG 10 like other SDGs. For instance, AI can identify inequality in the distribution of resources and access to services and help monitor changes over time (Vinuesa et al., 2020). Blockchain is a specific technology that can reduce inequalities. It can improve the transparency of donation and fundraising programs, allowing donors to monitor how their donations are used and how impactful they are. This will increase people's trust in social organizations and is likely to result in more donations (Mora et al., 2021). Through reducing transaction costs, using cryptocurrencies, blockchain platforms such as Bitpesa in Kenya have facilitated more remittances to developing countries. Such remittances are essential for strengthening the local economy and empowering vulnerable social groups (Mora et al., 2021). Further, in some contexts, such as Estonia, blockchain-based digital IDs have been given to migrants and refugees to track their access to financial resources, healthcare services, and employment opportunities, thereby reducing inequalities (Mora et al., 2021). Despite multiple potential benefits, some studies have challenged the claim that smart cities can provide quality services to all citizens. Luusua, Ylipulli, Foth, and Aurigi (2023) raise major concerns about privacy, security, and social equity. There are some doubts about the ability of AI-enabled software and decision algorithms to predict human behavior and make just decisions regarding recruitment and resource allocation. Such technologies' inherent bias and lack of transparency and accountability could result in flawed and discriminatory practices (Mhlanga, 2022; Vinuesa et al., 2020). There are also concerns that smart cities could exacerbate the digital divide, gentrification, and marginalization of low-income groups (Blasi et al., 2022; Kolotouchkina, Barroso, & Sánchez, 2022; Kourtit, Elmlund, & Nijkamp, 2020; Lam & Ma, 2019). Toli and Murtagh (2020) argue that it is unclear whether smart solutions benefit a specific “elitist” part of society or prioritize a certain societal group that is digitally skilled or can afford these solutions over others. There are also concerns that the increasing reliance on automation could have implications for old jobs (Vinuesa et al., 2020). Such concerns need attention since problems such as digital exclusion and digital divide exist even in developed countries (Acilar & Sæbø, 2023; Elena-Bucea, Cruz-Jesus, Oliveira, & Coelho, 2021; Skill, Wihlborg, & Kaharevic, 2020). The conditions are likely to be worse in developing countries. Context-sensitive and locally-driven smart city initiatives and technological transfer to developing countries are essential to ensure smart technologies will not worsen inequalities between developed and developing countries (Mhlanga, 2022; Vinuesa et al., 2020). 3.2.6. SDG 11: Sustainable cities and communities Cities have the unique ability to catalyze significant societal changes by fostering connections between sustainable development and technological innovation. The widespread urbanization and growth of smart solutions are global trends that have the potential to greatly impact our way of life in unprecedented ways (Jain, Gue, & Jain, 2023). The importance of developing innovative solutions to address sustainable development challenges is evident in SDG 11 (Alagirisamy & Ramesh, 2022; Tura & Ojanen, 2022). Indeed, advanced ICT is instrumental in protecting the environment, optimizing resource efficiency, upgrading infrastructure, promoting socio-economic development, and advancing human knowledge in cities (Grossi & Trunova, 2021; Visvizi and del Hoyo, 2021a, Visvizi and del Hoyo, 2021b). Advanced ICT and IoT offer cutting-edge solutions for optimizing and enhancing the sustainability of urban areas. This includes improving various aspects related to urban planning, design, operations, and governance. The integration of ICT/IoT in sustainable cities addresses the growing requirement for novel approaches to achieve long-term environmental sustainability and address challenges such as air pollution, safety, resource management, etc. (Almalki et al., 2021; Sharifi, Khavarian-Garmsir, Allam, & Asadzadeh, 2023). These solutions are associated with inclusivity, safety, resilience, efficiency, equity, and quality of life as key objectives of SDG 11. Despite these merits, as Powell (2021) warns, the optimization approach may overlook social and environmental concerns and restrict citizen involvement in shaping innovative city projects. Smart city solutions enabled by big data analytics could help cities deal with complex and dynamic interactions between different factors that are not easily addressed by static and linear models (Kourtit et al., 2020). Technologies such as drone-based sensing, deep learning, data sensing and analytics, Blockchain, and AI-enabled real-time monitoring of urban functions (e.g., energy and water consumption) are necessary for optimizing urban management and enhancing resilience, as shown in different cities such as Casablanca, New Delhi, and New Castle (Corbett & Mellouli, 2017; Parmentola et al., 2022; Thangavelu, 2020). Similarly, 3D urban environment models contribute to an enhanced understanding of urban phenomena such as pollution, flood risk, land use, urban form, and even socio-economic features (Santos, Deus, Rocha, & Tenedório, 2021; Wang, Hou, Miller, Brown, & Jiang, 2019). Nevertheless, arguments regarding the positive implications of big data analytics have not been uniformly affirmative, and some concerns have also been raised. For instance, Rittenbruch et al. (2022) delve into critiquing big data analytics and indicate that tensions exist between transparency and opacity, accuracy and uncertainty, and objectivity and subjectivity. They emphasize the necessity for algorithmic accountability, which is a significant mechanism for ensuring augmented transparency and confidence. A sector that has received much attention within the context of SDG 11 is urban mobility. Cryptocurrency-based car- and bike-sharing platforms such as FiarBike have been developed to promote shared mobility. Such platforms can also be used to collect finance for the maintenance and further development of shared mobility infrastructure. Other smart solutions, such as smartphone apps, have also contributed to the promotion of active and public transportation (Garber, Watkins, & Kramer, 2019; Mora et al., 2021). Smart solutions could also facilitate modal shift via car- and bike-sharing programs, reduce the need for travel and commuting by promoting online shopping and automated delivery, and improve the safety of pedestrians and cyclists by using sensors (El Hamdani, Benamar, & Younis, 2020; Huang, Thomas, Groenewolt, & van Berkum, 2022; Moreno et al., 2021). Collectively, these could promote proximity-based urban planning and active transportation with co-benefits for health and climate change mitigation (Moreno et al., 2021; Sharifi, Pathak, Joshi, & He, 2021). Automated transport is another key feature of smart cities. If planned and implemented properly and by considering urban-rural linkages, it can strengthen the connection between cities and their hinterland and promote regional growth (Soe, 2020). Well-planned automated transport could also enhance the accessibility of women, children, and the elderly. It can also improve road safety and reduce the environmental impacts of cities by decreasing the number of vehicles on roads and associated CO2 emissions (Grindsted, Christensen, Freudendal-Pedersen, Friis, & Hartmann-Petersen, 2022; Soe, 2020). However, poor implementation of transport automation will have negative effects as it could increase congestion and emissions (Grindsted et al., 2022; Soe, 2020). Some argue that Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are likely to generate rebound effects and increase car dependence, thereby increasing emissions and negatively impacting human health (Blasi et al., 2022; Grindsted et al., 2022). Integrating AVs with MaaS and Public transport policies could mitigate these issues (Grindsted et al., 2022). Indeed, AVs could further promote car sharing (Grindsted et al., 2022). Smart technologies have the potential to both enhance and adversely impact urban governance. Better interaction between people and urban authorities can be achieved through blockchain-based platforms that are less bureaucratic and can enhance citizen trust as the security of data collected via smart IoT tools and stored in blockchain platforms can be ensured. Such platforms further optimize interactions by enhancing speed and efficiency and minimizing corruption through traceability features (Mora et al., 2021). Urban authorities can use blockchain to collect taxes more efficiently and also verify information sent by taxpayers, thereby increasing municipalities' revenues (Makani, Pittala, Alsayed, Aloqaily, & Jararweh, 2022; Mora et al., 2021). However, on the dark side, Sheikh, Mitchell, and Foth (2023) point out that smart technologies can have negative implications for urban governance by prioritizing efficiency and data collection over the well-being of diverse species and ecosystems. According to the authors, this can shift attention away from the needs and perspectives of nonhuman life and may delay actions toward sustainable development. Smart cities could also cause issues such as disempowerment, marginalization, social exclusion, discrimination, governance corporatization, algorithmic bias, technocratic reductionism, techno-centricity, dataveillance, geosurveillance, privacy loss, cybersecurity risks, and democratic backsliding. These have been exacerbated following the COVID-19 pandemic due to the massive deployment of invasive technologies. Nevertheless, the COVID-19 crisis provides a great window of opportunity for policymakers to undertake transformative endeavors toward creating more just, resilient, safe, and sustainable cities (Amirzadeh, Sobhaninia, Buckman, & Sharifi, 2023; Sharifi, 2023; Sharifi & Khavarian-Garmsir, 2020). 3.2.7. SDG 12: Responsible consumption and production SDG 12 is at the heart of natural environment and resources management for driving sustainable economic development. This implies that it is strongly linked to multiple SDGs, including SDGs 11, 13, 7, and 9. It is of particular importance in global efforts to achieve environmental sustainability. SDG 12 has stimulated many opportunities for innovation under the “sustainable innovation” agenda. In this regard, new technologies play a crucial role in optimizing the utilization of natural resources and advancing our understanding and prevention of environmental issues. Smart cities rely on ICT and its applied innovative solutions to monitor, understand, analyze, and plan resource consumption patterns across different urban systems and domains (Charfeddine & Umlai, 2023; Irajifar, Chen, Lak, Sharifi, & Cheshmehzangi, 2023). These efforts also contribute to achieving climate goals associated with SGD13 (Charfeddine & Umlai, 2023; Ismagilova et al., 2019). The smart city approach based on the use of Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) and related automated processes is highly significant to advancing the model of Circular Economy (CE). For instance: the optimization of wastewater management can be enabled by the automation of the harvested rainwater collection in buildings, smart grid technologies can contribute to circularity through energy reduction and conservation using different means, product utilization can be maximized through pool sharing, e-waste can be reduced through replacement cycle and refurbishment, and recycled plastic waste can be boosted through virtual platforms (Siddiqui & Pandit, 2021). Smart solutions can contribute to sustainable consumption and production by improving solid waste management (Pardini, Rodrigues, Kozlov, Kumar, & Furtado, 2019). In this regard, Hannan et al. (2020) proposed a mixed-integer linear programming model utilizing Fixed Routing Optimization and Variable Routing Optimization for the optimization of solid waste collection (SWC). They focused on using bin monitoring as a smart solution to shift from a fixed route solid waste collection planning to variable route planning. Their study showed considerable optimization benefits with implications for multiple SDGs, including SDGs 7, 11, 12, and 13. Speaking of SDG 7 and its relation to SDG 13, Bibri and Krogstie (2020) investigated the innovative role of data-driven smart solutions in the context of smart cities. They found that the combined use and consideration of smart grids, smart meters, smart buildings and appliances, smart environmental monitoring, and smart urban metabolism can yield synergetic benefits. The benefits include energy efficiency improvement, renewable energy adoption, pollution reduction, and real-time energy and material flow feedback. For example, smart metering infrastructure can contribute to responsible consumption by optimizing consumers' energy consumption behaviors (Liaqat et al., 2021). Worth pointing out is that urban metabolism (UM) is of central focus in CE as a model that is used to understand and analyze the energy and material flow in urban environments. UM refers to “the total sum of the technical and socioeconomic processes that occur in cities, resulting in growth, production of energy, and elimination of waste.” (Kennedy, Cuddihy, & Engel-Yan, 2007). Smart urban metabolism (SUM) is an evolution of urban metabolism enabled by advanced ICT (see Bibri and Krogstie (2020) for a case study analysis and a detailed discussion). Further, one dimension of UM is the use of dynamic and high-resolution meter data for the evaluation of energy consumption and waste production in buildings. This involves the use of Building Information Modeling (BIM) as a tool for improving efficiency and reducing waste. For instance, BIM helps reduce construction waste (Liu et al., 2021). As an innovative technology, BIM can be used to enhance design efficiency and quality, collaboration between stakeholders, data exchange, design communication, and information sharing (Liu et al., 2021; Pereira, Santos, Leite, & Escórcio, 2021). Blockchain technology can also contribute to SDG 12. Its novelty lies in enabling new methods for green energy production, “monitoring and storing data related activities responsible for pollution and environmental degradation, and real-time collection and analysis of green or low carbon data for timely decision making” (Parmentola et al., 2022). Further, it can oversee the groundwater of urban areas, monitor EV charging systems (Parmentola et al., 2022), inform “consumers about less-efficient appliances in their premises” (Liaqat et al., 2021), and monitor compliance with sustainability standards. The latter can be achieved through product traceability which can also reduce resource inefficiencies and losses at the different stages of supply chain (Mora et al., 2021). Despite these benefits, the high energy requirements for AI applications in the case of the use of non carbon-neutral sources of energy could undermine the efforts to achieve the goal of Climate Action (SDG 13) (Vinuesa et al., 2020). 3.2.8. SDG 13: Climate action SDG 13 on climate action pertains particularly to cities as major contributors to GHG emissions (Aboagye and Sharifi, 2023, Aboagye and Sharifi, 2024; Lwasa et al., 2022). According to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), enabling city governments to effectively handle data management challenges will be crucial in achieving the decarbonization agenda. While the nexus between ICT and climate change has been a topic of great interest since the early 2000s, it was not until recently that it became important in the context of smart cities. This nexus spans various urban domains associated with high emission levels, such as transportation, energy, building, industry, and waste. Bibri and Krogstie (2020) provide a set of data-driven strategies and pathways for energy efficiency and pollution reduction as solutions for advancing the environmental sustainability of smart cities. These are based on the overarching strategy “resource efficiency and climate responsibility” that is to be adopted by sustainable smart cities that aim to reduce GHG emissions to a level below 1 ton per inhabitant by 2030 and to become fossil fuel-free and climate-positive by 2050. This entails reducing energy consumption and carbon footprint as well as using digitalization and “new technologies to make it easier for citizens and businesses to be environmentally friendly.” Regarding emerging models of urbanism, Moreno et al. (2021) emphasize the potential role of digitalization in improving the different sustainability aspects of the 15-Minute city, as digital technologies have the potential to enable cities to optimize and improve service delivery by significantly reducing the time needed for citizens to accomplish social functions, thereby saving time from mobility and traffic and hence reducing emissions from vehicles which in turn save urban environments. The 15-minute city model can also offer multiple other co-benefits for economic, environmental, and social sustainability (Khavarian-Garmsir, Sharifi, Hajian Hossein Abadi, & Moradi, 2023; Khavarian-Garmsir, Sharifi, & Sadeghi, 2023). AI and other advanced technologies for modeling and monitoring have also shown great potential for waste collection optimization through fixed and variable routing optimization (Hannan et al., 2020). This also has significant benefits for multiple SDGs, namely SDGs 3, 6, 11, and 14, both directly and indirectly (Hannan et al., 2020). AI applications have the potential to contribute greatly to environmental sustainability. They can analyze large-scale databases, allowing for joint actions in preserving the environment. AI can also help improve our understanding of climate change and model its potential impacts. Additionally, it enables high integration of renewable energy sources and smart energy systems, enhancing ecosystem health and supporting circular economies. Furthermore, AI aids in creating efficient resource usage within low-carbon cities (Vinuesa et al., 2020). Such contributions also provide co-benefits for SDGs 7, 11, and 13 (Vinuesa et al., 2020). Furthermore, data sharing among consumers and third parties enables novel services, such as energy management, which support low-carbon practices and options. Also, data sharing among third parties and other stakeholders enables innovative services for smart cities and helps achieve the objectives of sustainable development and decarbonization (Liaqat et al., 2021). As regards blockchain, a number of solutions have been proposed or developed, including its use to address and improve the management of the emission trading and auditing schemes (Lu et al., 2022; Parmentola et al., 2022), to provide credible trading services for polluters (Parmentola et al., 2022), to facilitate public participation in addressing the challenges of climate change, and to tokenize carbon credits (Mora et al., 2021). Concerning emission monitoring, the integration of blockchain and the IoT provides reliability to the available data and establishes the homogeneity of measurement criteria, which in turn “minimize registration errors and eliminate fraud arising from the accounting and measurement of gas emissions” (Mora et al., 2021). In terms of trade-offs, the use of advanced ICT involves direct effects on the environment. In this respect, large computing centers, which provide massive computational resources required by AI technology research, design, and development, are associated with significant energy consumption and, thus, carbon footprint, compromising SDGs 7 and 13 (Vinuesa et al., 2020). Moreover, the domination of technocratic approaches in planning systems is criticized by some scholars, like Yigitcanlar, Foth, and Kamruzzaman (2019), who noted that focusing solely on these approaches in urban innovation has left planning systems ill-equipped to address underlying environmental issues. Therefore, comprehensive reform in governance and politics is necessary to advance urban innovations. In this regard, Fieuw, Foth, and Caldwell (2022) advocate for moving beyond a narrow focus on technological solutions and instead adopting a more systemic approach that addresses the root causes of climate change, such as social and economic inequality, unsustainable consumption patterns, and the exploitation of natural resources. They argue that this approach can help promote multispecies justice and cohabitation and lead to more equitable and sustainable urban environments for all. Overall, ICT can pose risks to environmental sustainability. These risks go beyond direct effects, also encompassing indirect effects, systemic effects, and rebound effects. 3.2.9. Key issues related to other SDGs 3.2.9.1. SDG 1 The other SDGs have received relatively less attention in the literature. However, the reported evidence shows that smart city solutions and technologies can also be linked to SDGs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 15, 15, 16, and 17. It is possible to infer from the reviewed literature that smart city solutions and technologies can indirectly contribute to alleviating poverty (SDG 1). It is argued that ICT infrastructure and artificial intelligence could lead to economic growth and facilitate the provision of food and other services, thereby contributing to poverty eradication (Joia & Kuhl, 2019; Vinuesa et al., 2020). Policymakers can utilize mart solutions such as big data analytics and image processing to identify poverty areas, find out the root causes of poverty, and explore scenarios for empowering vulnerable groups by ensuring better access to resources and services (Ismagilova et al., 2019; Vinuesa et al., 2020). Efficiency improvement and operational optimization are other contributions that could help address poverty issues. However, inequality trade-offs may emerge if smart cities are not implemented following the principles of social justice (Joia & Kuhl, 2019). 3.2.9.2. SDG 2 Smart city technologies could also contribute to minimizing hunger (SDG 2) through innovative planning approaches, especially in relation to developing countries. Among other things, smart technologies can contribute to reducing food waste (Ahmadzadeh, Ajmal, Ramanathan, & Duan, 2023; Varghese et al., 2021), promoting innovation and behavioral change (Baena et al., 2020), and enabling more efficient data-driven ways of agricultural production, biodiversity protection, food conservation, crop forecasting, and soil management, all of which are essential for achieving zero hunger (Ryan et al., 2020). Achieving such contributions depends on the availability of just and effective governance mechanisms. Otherwise, the uneven distribution of smart technologies, such as AI-enabled agricultural equipment, would make it challenging to reduce hunger, particularly in developing countries (Vinuesa et al., 2020). 3.2.9.3. SDG 4 Smart technologies are increasingly used to ensure quality education in cities. The decentralization features of technologies such as Blockchain offer opportunities to improve access to education services and learning materials. Smart technologies are also becoming increasingly important in managing, improving, and evaluating educational systems. These technologies offer a range of tools and techniques that can support these processes effectively (Nikitin, Lantsev, Nugaev, & Yakovleva, 2016; Spector, 2016). Other potential contributions are minimizing private education costs, facilitating self-learning and creative education, enabling e-learning, and providing life-long education opportunities (Iqbal, Parra-Saldivar, Zavala-Yoe, & Ramirez-Mendoza, 2020). Despite multiple potential contributions, equality remains a major constraint on access to platforms enabled by smart technologies. Digital accessibility should be enhanced to minimize quality trade-offs pertinent to SDG 4. 3.2.9.4. SDG 5 Gender equality (SDG 5), inclusion/exclusion, and access are areas where the conflicts among the global agendas of SDGs are particularly evident in the context of smart cities (Sagaris & Tiznado-Aitken, 2020). Hatuka and Zur (2020) argue that the initiatives that address inequality in smart cities are still at the margins, calling for shifting the focus from the city to society in developing digital initiatives and cultivating smart social urbanism. In particular, achieving the objectives of SDG 5 entails improving the use of ICT as a set of enabling technologies to promote the empowerment of women and adopting and strengthening sound policies that promote gender equality. One major trade-off mentioned in the literature is regarding the potential reproduction of social biases against women by machine-learning algorithms that rely on information available online (Lo Piano, 2020; Vinuesa et al., 2020). Better training of such algorithms is needed to avoid such issues. Diversifying the AI workforce and better inclusion of women could also be helpful (Vinuesa et al., 2020). 3.2.9.5. SDG 9 Smart cities offer unparalleled opportunities for the attainment of SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure), as they provide platforms that allow diverse innovations to emerge and be advanced. These innovations boost the urban economy and benefit multiple sectors, including industry and infrastructure (Ismagilova et al., 2020). Among different smart technologies, Blockchain has been highlighted in the literature for its capacity to enable green production and facilitate greener supply chain and logistics (Parmentola et al., 2022). It can also strengthen the innovative capacity of low-income economies by offering innovative finance and banking models where, for instance, people in developed countries can provide small loans to small and medium enterprises in developing countries using cryptocurrencies (Mora et al., 2021). However, investing in resilient infrastructure and implementing industrial innovation could be costly, making it challenging for local governments to achieve other goals. W. Powell, Foth, Cao, and Natanelov (2022) identify several challenges associated with using blockchain technology. They warn that significant volumes of energy are required to validate transactions and maintain the blockchain, which can have negative environmental impacts. Another challenge is the lack of standardization and interoperability between different blockchain systems, which can limit their effectiveness in achieving sustainable development goals. Additionally, there is a need for greater awareness and understanding of blockchain technology among stakeholders, including policymakers, businesses, and communities, to ensure that it is used in a responsible and ethical manner. These are key trade-offs that need to be addressed. 3.2.9.6. SDG 14 Through its innovative solutions, smart cities can provide tools for carefully managing resources that regulate human needs, including water resources. Among other things, AI can play a key role in preventing and reducing marine pollution through the automatic identification techniques enabled by emerging powerful algorithms (Vinuesa et al., 2020). Coastal waters are being continuously polluted, exacerbating the detrimental effects of ocean acidification on ecosystems and biodiversity. This pollution is negatively impacting small-scale fisheries (UN, 2022). To address some of these issues, blockchain mechanisms are being implemented “to monitor water pollution and preserve marine resources” (Parmentola et al., 2022). Blockchain technology has been utilized in reward programs where fishermen or coastal residents are provided with cryptocurrency tokens. These tokens can be later exchanged for credit, enabling them to collect and share data regarding the environmental conditions of water bodies. This valuable information can contribute to improving decision-making processes, designing effective regulations, and supporting platforms dedicated to safeguarding coral reefs (Mora et al., 2021). Other potential contributions of smart solutions to SDG 14 are explained in Supplementary Appendix II. 3.2.9.7. SDG 15 Implementation of the smart city concept can help achieve the goals captured in SDG 15 (Life of Land), especially regarding halting and reversing land degradation and slowing biodiversity loss. However, our analysis showcases that there was no research work directly focused on SDG 15 (see Fig. 3). Notwithstanding, as detailed in Supplementary Appendix II, it can be argued that many activities and projects initiated in smart cities, particularly in sectors like transport, manufacturing, and energy, can have significant impacts on promoting the protection and restoration of various ecosystems such as terrestrial areas and forests. However, some of the smart city programs, such as the installation of city-wide lighting systems, as noted in the article by Tavares et al. (2021), prompt negative impacts on different ecosystems, thus exposing the negative side of smart cities, especially in pursuit of SDGs 14, 15, 2, 3, and 6. 3.2.9.8. SDG 16 This goal is a critical goal for urban planning, as it can help streamline agendas such as governance, education, and livability. It emphasizes the need to build effective, accountable, and inclusive institutions, which were often neglected in previous urban planning models. Justice and strong institutions are essential for tackling urban issues, such as human rights violations, violence, climate change, and cost of living, which have led to severe consequences such as human displacements and terrorism (Artusio et al., 2017). Smart technologies, such as Blockchain and AI, offer promising solutions for implementing SDG 16 in urban areas. For instance, Blockchain can provide credible platforms for registering and storing information related to vulnerable groups, while AI can enable e-voting and facial recognition for democratization and security (Allam, 2018; Ismagilova et al., 2020; Moura & Gomes, 2017). However, smart technologies also pose challenges and risks, such as data privacy, algorithmic bias, and corporate manipulation. Human interventions, especially through policies and regulatory frameworks, are required to complement the use of smart technologies and ensure their ethical and responsible application. Pre-emptive legislation is recommended to prevent the misuse of smart technologies that would compromise the achievement of SDG 16 in urban areas. Stronger institutions are also needed that adhere to transparency and accountability principles in deploying smart technologies in urban affairs (Truby, 2020). Overall, SDG 16 is a relevant and timely goal for urban planning, as well as an opportunity and a challenge for smart technologies. A balanced and integrated approach that combines smart technologies with human interventions is advocated to ensure urban sustainability, resilience, and innovation. 3.2.9.9. SDG 17 Regarding the Partnership for the Goals (SDG 17), the smart city agenda has the potential to engender key partnership aspects through an elaborate interconnectedness of services and actors, allowing residents, urban authorities, service providers, and other stakeholders to collaborate toward creating resilient social-ecological-technological systems (Ismagilova et al., 2019; Sharifi, 2023; Sharifi & Allam, 2021). According to Drapalova and Wegrich (2020), the need for collaboration is important not only for the achievement of SDG 17 but for all the other individual SDGs. In cities, collaboration could be viewed via different dimensions, including technologies and innovations, sharing of information and data, and knowledge transfer. However, despite the promises, there has been an increasing concern regarding the lack of standardization of protocols and frameworks to guide the manufacturing and deployment of smart devices and objects (Sethi & Sarangi, 2017). As such, implementing smart cities has been expensive, as smart device manufacturers maintained their unique proprietary standards, meaning that other devices cannot be seamlessly integrated (Nelson, Toth, Linders, Nguyen, & Rhee, 2019). This is a key trade-off that needs attention. 4. Conclusions The world has experienced unprecedented growth in population during the past decades. In the meantime, climate change has become a key threat to human security. These phenomena have exacerbated numerous challenges, especially in the urban realm, prompting the global community to seek sustainable solutions. This motivated the introduction of the 17 SDGs in 2015. Long before the launch of the SDGs, there was an interest in the global arena in adopting smart solutions and technologies for solving global issues (Anthopoulos, 2017; Sharifi, Allam, Feizizadeh, & Ghamari, 2021). Protagonists of smart cities argue that smart solutions could solve a majority of urban challenges, with some arguing that they have the potential to accelerate the achievement of the SDGs (Joia & Kuhl, 2019). This systematic review demonstrated that responsible development and implementation of smart city solutions and technologies could contribute to the progress toward sustainable development goals. Most studies examining the linkages have been published in the past two years, indicating that this field is emergent. Although indirect linkages between all SDGs and smart city solutions can be established, the analysis showed that the focus is mainly on SDGs 11, 12, 7, 6, and 4. More work on other SDGs is, therefore, needed. A key finding is a bias toward reporting positive contributions. This has also been highlighted in other studies related to SDGs (Vinuesa et al., 2020). As Table 1 shows, among other things, the benefits include accelerating economic growth, improving efficiency, enhancing managerial practices, strengthening innovation, and raising citizen awareness. Overall, in the literature, the benefits of smart cities outweigh the trade-offs. However, we found that potential trade-offs and challenges related to privacy and cyber security, costs of infrastructure upgrading, the risk of the increased cost of living, the digital divide and lack of skills, rebound effects, biased decision-making, reproduction of social biases, and the limited legal setup can also occur.

Nelson et al., 2019; Sethi & Sarangi, 2017; Sharifi & Allam, 2021) Overcoming the challenges requires government interventions and multi-scale governance mechanisms to ensure balanced growth and avoid disproportionate impacts on some societal groups. Developing standard and interoperable formats for secure data collection and exchange is one solution that could offer opportunities for the engagement of different groups and stakeholders in smart cities, thereby enhancing the prospect of contribution to SDGs (Liaqat et al., 2021). Stakeholder engagement and consultation could ensure that smart solutions can meet the needs of people. A key challenge is the potential misuse of AI and the risk of biased decision-making toward certain societal groups. Indeed, many smart solutions and technologies, such as those based on AI, are still in their incipient stages. Effective governance and regulatory measures are needed to ensure they will not undermine the achievement of SDGs (Truby, 2020). Preventing this requires transparency with algorithms and training programs (Truby, 2020), government interventions to ensure that AI is human-centered (Mhlanga, 2022), developing ethical standards and regular auditing to ensure compliance with them, and measures to regulate surveillance technologies and practices of governments and corporations (Truby, 2020). The COVID-19 crisis and other syndemics will have far-reaching implications for surveillance society, with potential implications for achieving SDGs. As Kitchin (2020) argued, this crisis “was an opportunity for the state to further roll-out and normalize surveillance technologies and there is little sense that the tracking implemented there will be rolled-back post-crisis.” The surveillance system deployed to combat the COVID-19 pandemic will become part of the “new normal” in digitally monitoring and governing societies. This may result in mass surveillance practiced mainly by big tech companies and in legitimating tyranny by democratic states, thereby eroding civil liberties related to privacy and democracy. At the core of the “new normal” is the intensification of the hyper-connectivity, datafication, algorithmization, and platformization of the social organization resulting from all kinds of interactions and activities that citizens perform as part of everyday life in smart cities. Platformization refers to “the penetration of infrastructures, economic processes, and governmental frameworks of digital platforms in different economic sectors and spheres of life, as well as the reorganization of cultural practices and imaginations around these platforms” (Poell et al., 2019). Platforms as an ideological formation are associated with smart cities and sharing economy (Barta & Neff, 2016). They steer both platform-based user interactions as well as economic transactions (Poell et al., 2019), which are associated with the governance dimension of platformization (Gorwa, 2019). Major companies have actively repurposed their platforms and data to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic and potential future syndemics. For instance, Google, Meta, Apple, and Microsoft have developed initiatives to monitor the effects of interventionist measures globally and facilitate contact tracing. They have also generated and shared real-time location and mobility data (Brandom & Robertson, 2020; Kitchin, 2020). However, some criticisms underscore the concerns surrounding the involvement of these big companies in public health measures and the potential implications for governance and autonomy. For instance, some scholars criticized the Google-Apple Exposure Notification (GAEN) framework for promoting a technocratic solution and challenging state sovereignty (Mann et al., 2022; Mann, Mitchell, Foth, & Anastasiu, 2020). Overall, the emergence of these solutionist technologies has led to the development of new approaches in management and governance. In fact, the utilization of surveillance technologies has made social and spatial sorting more commonplace. A rigid techno-dystopian stance is one of the socio-spatial implications of platform-mediated urban everyday life and urban futures (Strüver & Bauriedl, 2022). Indeed, the new routines of social and spatial sorting have “the potential to permanently shift the nature of governmentality and to also act as a pathway towards authoritarian forms of governance where technology is used to actively impose the will of the state onto citizens” (Kitchin, 2020). This has entrenched the wrong idea that the techno-managerialist mode of governing by code in smart cities is the only option to go, with no alternative scenario. It has been promoted as the most effective and efficient way to manage citizens through the systemic collection and algorithmic processing of data for decision-making purposes that exclude political action. These forms of algorithmic technocratic governance are set to cement and normalize the governmental logic of capture and control instead of surveillance and discipline. Regulatory frameworks and transparency of algorithms are, therefore, essential and should be prioritized. There are also examples of more citizen-centric and community-oriented governance alternatives that should be followed to ensure smart solutions contribute to creating livable and sustainable cities (Foth, Anastasiu, Mann, & Mitchell, 2021; Mattern & De, 2021; Powell, 2021). With its multifarious consequences, it is evident that the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis will not fade any time soon and will be felt in our ways of living and working in cities. In fact, it is already shown that the pandemic has slowed down progress toward SDGs (De Las Heras, Luque-Sendra and Zamora-Polo, 2020a, De Las Heras, Luque-Sendra and Zamora-Polo, 2020b). This calls for the need to critically investigate or engage with smart urbanism regarding how it may shape urban futures and its evolution to platform urbanism and its development in response to this crisis. It is also important to address issues such as social exclusion, discrimination, dataveillance, geosurveillance, privacy erosion, mind control, and democratic decay (Bibri & Allam, 2022). Especially this crisis has worsened the effects of big tech companies getting involved in data policies and public trust in data governance through the accelerated adoption of digital technologies (Li, Ma, & Wu, 2022). Consequently, from an ethical perspective, “most of the policies, regulations, legislations, and auditing mechanisms created and established in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic are of a destructive nature and directed towards stripping away people from their natural and constitutional rights” (Bibri & Allam, 2022). This review calls for a better investigation of these issues and their implications for achieving SDGs in future studies. This will be essential to ensure that the economic ambitions pursued via the deployment of smart cities will be aligned with SDGs. Other key research gaps related to the interlinkages between smart cities and SDGs that need to be addressed in future research include: implications of platformization for achieving SDGs; trade-offs for understudied SDGs such as SDG No. 14 and SDG NO. 17; and trade-offs beyond issues related to costs, equity, and energy efficiency. Also, it is important to mention that interlinkages between smart cities and SDGs are not just limited to co-benefits and trade-offs. Synergies and conflicts are two other important types of interactions that should also be examined. Synergies could occur when the simultaneous implementation of smart city solutions and SDG efforts could lead to greater benefits than when they are implemented separately. In contrast, conflict, while not common, refers to a situation when the simultaneous implementation of these two could be difficult. Examining synergies and conflicts allow for obtaining a more comprehensive understanding of interactions between smart cities and SDGs. Finally, as existing research is mainly conceptual and theoretical, it is important to do more empirical research on the interactions between smart cities and SDGs.

The analysis focuses on the hermeneutical problems that emerge from the process through which the Chilean environmental institutions translated the dense cosmogony of the Mapuche-Williche communities around the Pilmaiquén River during the environmental assessment of the Osorno Hydroelectric Power Plant, through the category of a “site of cultural significance”, and the impacts that this process has had over time. I argue that, although the category of site of cultural significance made the meaning of water in the normative world of the Mapuche-Williche communities of this territory commensurable, understandable, and partially comparable, it deprived it of its complex meanings, giving rise to various equivocations that imply forms of epistemic injustice of a hermeneutic type. Keywords: Legal pluralismepistemic injusticeindigenous rightsenvironmental assessmentMapuche-Williche people Introduction This paper seeks to draw analytical attention to the debates around the recognition of legal pluralism to understand Mapuche-Williche expressions of water rights in southern Chile and their implications in the context of environmental regulation and institutions. Conflicts over water in Mapuche territory (Wallmapu) have generally involved large and small hydroelectric projects, where issues of water governance, environmental regulation and recognition of indigenous peoples’ rights intersect (Bauer 2015, 156; Kelly 2019b; Kelly 2018a). For decades, water governance and management, especially in the Andean region, has offered a fertile field of study for examining constellations of locally expressed norms, where diverse normative systems overlap in time and space, within and across state borders (von Benda-Beckmann, von Benda-Beckmann, and Spierz 1997; Prieto 2012; Prieto 2014). However, in redefining ways to regulate and control land and water, state and transnational legal frameworks, as well as water infrastructure (including projects to exploit the hydropower potential of watersheds), have generally involved a disruption of existing local land and water rights systems (Roth, Boelens, and Zwarteveen 2015, 457). In addition, the development of water projects and infrastructure has traditionally been dominated by economic and technical forms of scientific expertise that have little regard and respect for local knowledge and existing systems of land and water management and allocation (Kelly 2019b, 224–226). The Chilean Water Code, in force since 1981, has been considered a paradigmatic example of a neoliberal model of water management, by allowing the privatization of this common good and its monopolization for speculative purposes (Bauer 2004). Likewise, the environmental reforms that have been promoted in Chile since the 1990s have followed the logic of having laws that allow the commercialization of natural resources for the country’s insertion into global markets (Tecklin, Bauer, and Prieto 2011; Kelly, Guerra-Schleef, and Valdés-Negroni 2021). On the other hand, at least since the 1990s, the efforts of the Mapuche communities and organizations have focused on making visible the conflicts between community uses of the territory and private interests over the waters in those territories, particularly in the context of the promotion of hydroelectric power plants. At that time, national and international attention was focused on Ralco and Pangue hydroelectric power plants in the Pewenche territory of Alto Biobío. Since then, the discursive registers of the Mapuche communities have evoked the sacred character of the bodies of water that will be affected, as well as the relationship between the territory and the different human and non-human beings that inhabit it (Llancaman 2020). This emphasis from the Mapuche point of view has been shared in many cases such as Neltume, Pilmaiken, Trankura and Truful Truful, to name just a few (Llancaman 2020; Cardoso and Pacheco-Pizarro 2021). At this point, a central debate arises on legal pluralism in Chile, which is related to how to seriously consider the diverse local systems of rights without eliminating or subordinating them, without leveling their differences with the logically ordered and hierarchical state laws (Cardoso and Pacheco-Pizarro 2021). This allows me to focus on the question that -as a human rights defender- seems central to me to understanding the challenges faced by indigenous peoples as they attempt to make their rights systems legible in the current Chilean legal context: How do Mapuche communities navigate the Chilean legal system in deciding when and how to translate fundamental aspects of their normative systems and epistemological frameworks into the legal categories of the Chilean state? What are the consequences, and how are they distributed among groups of humans, non-humans and more-than-humans? To address these questions, this paper examines the conflict surrounding the hydroelectric power plants developed by the Norwegian state-owned company, Statkraft, in the Mapuche-Williche communities’ territory of the Pilmaiquén River (hereafter the “Pilmaiken case”). This case provides an example of legal pluralism from which to explore the complexity and plurality expressed in the policies of implementation of indigenous rights in Chile after the ratification of International Labor Organization (ILO) Convention 169 (2008). This case was chosen because it constitutes a conflict of long duration, which has extended over 17 years, representing a longitudinal opportunity to observe how ILO Convention 169 has been domesticated and adapted to a diversity of local legal practices, as well as the strategies of accommodation and resistance promoted by the different actors (indigenous, state and companies) involved in the governance of water in this country. I focus my analysis on the hermeneutic problems that emerge from the process through which the Chilean environmental institutions translated the dense cosmogony of the Mapuche-Williche communities around the Pilmaiquén River and the Ngen Mapu Kintuantü during the environmental assessment of the Osorno Hydroelectric Power Plant (2007–2009), through the category of “site of cultural significance”, and the impacts that this process has had over time. I argue that although the category of site of cultural significance made the meaning of water in the normative world of the Mapuche-Williche communities of this territory commensurable, understandable, and partially comparable, it deprived it of its complex meanings, giving rise to what Castro identifies as an “equivocation” (Castro 2004). I suggest this translates into a form of hermeneutic epistemic injustice (Fricker 2007). To develop this argument, this article is organized in five sections. First, I present the methodological approach guiding this research, which was based on collaboration guided by the Aylla Rewe Ngen Mapu Kintuantü, while I worked as a lawyer for this traditional Mapuche-Williche organization. Second, I develop the theoretical framework, which is informed by a socio-legal approach from legal pluralism to understand the forms of epistemic-hermeneutic injustice at the heart of this case. To present the hermeneutical problems and injustices that arise from the process of cultural translation between normative orders in this case, I use concepts that have been developed in the anthropology of legal culture and equivocation. Third, I present my case study. I begin with some historical background on the colonization process of the Mapuche-Williche territory between the Pilmaiquén and Chirre rivers; and then contextualize the concept of ngen and the meaning of water to the particularities of the AzMapu (or Mapuche law) of this territory. I examine how, through the category of site of cultural significance, the dense cosmogony around the Ngen Kintuantü and the Pilmaiquén River is translated during the environmental assessment of the Osorno Hydroelectric Power Plant and the impacts of this process over time. Fourth, I discuss the limits of this translation process, exploring the misunderstandings and equivocations that are made explicit in this case. Finally, this paper ends with the main conclusions. Methodological approach The data and reflections presented here are the result of a collaborative research with ancestral authorities and Mapuche-Williche communities that are part of the Aylla Rewe Ngen Mapu Kintuantü, an autonomous indigenous organization with which I worked for 8 years as a lawyer, accompanying their legal strategies in defense of the Pilmaiquén River and the Ngen Mapu Kintuantü (guardian and ruling entity of this territory). As a non-indigenous Chilean lawyer, I arrived in this territory in 2015, as part of the legal team of Observatorio Ciudadano, a non-governmental organization dedicated to the defense of the collective rights of indigenous peoples in Chile. There I met Machi Millaray Huichalaf, spiritual authority of this territory and defender of the Pilmaiquén River and the Ngen Kintuantü and began to become actively involved in the processes and legal strategies analyzed in this paper. The Aylla Rewe Ngen Mapu Kintuantü is a political, social, spiritual, and cultural alliance of ancestral authorities and Mapuche-Williche communities (lof) of this territory, which has rearticulated to, among other things, resist hydroelectric interventions in the Pilmaiquén River. This organization is connected to an ancestral form of management and socio-political alliance of the territory around an Aylla rewe, which operates at the territorial scale of this basin. An Aylla rewe generally includes nine rewe. The latter are sacred spaces located in a gillatuwe, lepuntuwe or paliwe, among other places where prayers and ceremonies are held (Machi Millaray Huichalaf, Oral communication, November 1st, 2023). Therefore, the Aylla Rewe Ngen Mapu Kintuantü is both a political and a spiritual organization. Likewise, its members are part of the Mapuche People, which is the largest indigenous people in both Chile and Argentina. Specifically, they identify themselves as Williche, which corresponds to the southern part of this indigenous people, which has occupied since time immemorial the Futawillimapu (or “great southern territory”, in mapuzungun), which covers the extensive territorial space between the Toltén River, in the north, and insular and continental Chiloé, in the south (Comisión de Verdad Histórica y Nuevo Trato con los Pueblos Indígenas 2008, 443–444). The research was guided by a case study (Yin 2014) in the Mapuche-Williche territory of Pilmaiquén, with the aim of understanding the territorial-legal development of conflicts over indigenous rights in Chile. Because my first approach to this territory was not as a researcher, and my interest in critically analyzing what I was observing developed as I began to collaborate as a defense lawyer, this work was intended to support the legal strategies of territorial defense of the Aylla Rewe Ngen Mapu Kintuantü. This was part of the working agreement with the ancestral authorities of this organization, which deeply influenced the methods we finally applied to answer my main research question (Kovach 2020). Thus, the qualitative case study presented here emerged to follow up on the emerging conflicts and critically reflect on the hydroelectric power plants and the corresponding legal cases. The methodological strategy was data triangulation, which implies that the researcher diversifies and interweaves his sources of information. This makes it possible to avoid a single point of view and obtain more solid and reliable results, since each method can compensate for the limitations of the others (Denzin 2009). This strategy seeks to increase the validity and reliability of the findings, as well as to provide a more complete and deeper understanding of the phenomenon studied (Patton 1980, 108–109). A combination of methods were used, including legal analysis and review of administrative (environmental assessments of the projects, administrative appeals, land claim proceedings) and judicial files of the cases (Environmental Courts, Court of Appeals and Supreme Court), as well as other documents and previous research in the territory (reports from administrative agencies, anthropological reports, historical literature on the colonization of the territory, among others). I also conducted a semi-structured interview with two Statkraft managers in Chile in April 2023. This allowed me to collect relevant information on the legal cases linked to the conflict, and to understand in depth how state agencies and the company have understood the impacts of these projects in relation to the river, the communities and the ngen. Since a central aim of this research is the process of cultural translation between normative orders that takes place in this case, a crucial piece of my strategy was ethnographic participant observation. In this context, I participated in several ceremonies to which I was invited as a wenui (friend), which allowed me to become familiar with and learn first-hand about the dense cosmogony that exists in this territory around the Ngen Mapu Kintuantü and the Pilmaiquén River. A central element of my ethnographic observation also took place through the trawün that we held periodically to inform and make decisions about legal cases. The trawün correspond to work meetings and collective decision making. An important facet of the trawün is the exchange of dreams (pewma), through which profound local knowledge is expressed, and community members and ancestral authorities connect with the territory and their ancestors. The dialogue that is generated around this type of practices is fundamental to make diagnoses of the situations experienced in the territory, deliberate, and make decisions under the mantle of wisdom. In this context, the traditional form of conversation is called nütram. This way of working, which we have been practicing since I started working with the Aylla Rewe Ngen Mapu Kintuantü, has allowed us to build mutual trust and develop a co-learning that evokes what Kovach calls “conversation as method”, a dialogic approach to collect and co-create knowledge based on the indigenous relational tradition (Kovach 2020, 44). This process provided me with a mechanism to involve the Aylla rewe leaders in the analysis of the data, with the aim of identifying significant differences in the way the state and the company understood the river and the ngen. The trawün were also instrumental in discussing with them how they would like to communicate aspects of their worldview to the public in a collaborative writing process. This research approach is appropriate for studying indigenous rights as an outsider to the Mapuche territory, since it allows me to work with them to understand how the law works in the service of territorial needs, which has been defined as a methodological agreement that I have made with long term collaborators to elaborate and prepare legal cases with Mapuche territories and technical support professionals (Kelly, Guerra-Schleef, and Valdés-Negroni 2021). This is critical given my partial perspective as a non-indigenous human rights defender of Chilean descent, educated in Western academic institutions in Chile. Thus, even though the ancestral authorities and communities that make up the Aylla Rewe Ngen Mapu Kintuantü have entrusted me with the responsibility of sharing their testimonies and stories, as well as translating and representing their claims before Chilean administrative and judicial authorities, I do not claim to have universal knowledge about their territorial traditions, epistemic frameworks and cosmovisions. Finally, it is important to note that this work, although by a single author, draws on knowledge generated from previous writing collaborations. Particularly important to me have been the collaborations with Sarah Kelly, an American geographer I met in 2016 while working on an indigenous consultation process in the Ranco lake. At the time Sarah, along with José Miguel Valdés-Negroni and her partner Julio Muñoz, were investigating and learning about the development of small hydroelectric power plants in the territory of the Alianza Territorial del Puelwillimapu (Kelly 2018a; Kelly, Guerra-Schleef, and Valdés-Negroni 2021; Kelly 2021; Kelly and Negroni 2020; Valdés-Negroni 2017). Our affinities in terms of political, conceptual, and methodological concerns have led us to forge a collaborative work that has resulted, among other things, in the preparation of various reports and documents to support legal strategies and critically reflect on the territorial defense of the Williche organizations with which we work (Kelly, Valdes-Negroni, and Guerra-Schleef 2017; Kelly 2018b; Kelly 2019a; Kelly, Guerra-Schleef, and Valdés-Negroni 2021). In this way, both the problem and the research questions presented here reflect, in an important way, the long and interesting debates in which I have participated in. This speaks for within the organization where I worked, and as well for with the communities and other professionals with whom I work. Theoretical framework A socio-legal approach: two lenses of hermeneutic injustice and legal pluralism This paper combines two analytical lenses to examine the forms of injustice at the heart of the Pilmaiken case: legal pluralism and epistemic injustice. Both lenses offer an appropriate socio-legal approach to examine the forms of structural injustice experienced by indigenous peoples as they seek to make their epistemic and normative frameworks legible through the legal categories of state law. The evolving field of legal pluralism has proven enormously fruitful in challenging ideas about the centrality of state law and raising awareness about the diversity of ways in which individuals and groups interact with the law. The concept of legal pluralism, as currently used in legal anthropology, describes the multiple forms that law takes within communities, regions, particular states or at the global level, a “[…] system produced to an important extent by processes of colonialism and postcolonialism” (Merry 2012, 62). Plural legal situations have different but coexisting conceptions of justice, permissible actions, valid transactions, as well as ideas and procedures for handling conflicts in the same social space (Merry 1988; von Benda-Beckmann 2001; von Benda-Beckmann 2002, 38). Here, it is important to note that the initial studies on legal pluralism have evolved from an initial view that imagined the coexistence of different legal orders in the same socio-political space as separate entities in a hierarchical relationship -as occurred in the dual legal systems common to British colonialism- to a theory of unequal but mutually constitutive legal orders (Moore 1973; Griffiths 1986; Santos 1987; Merry 1988; Prieto 2012). In this context, the important issue to understand in contemporary studies of legal pluralism is the interaction between legal systems, leading to new questions that emphasize bidirectionality, co-constitution, hybridization and the dialectic of influence (Merry 2012, 68; Santos 1987). In this context, this paper seeks to contribute to new studies on legal pluralism by examining the interaction between state law and indigenous peoples’ legal systems, focusing on the problems of translation that these groups experience when they attempt to make their normative worlds legible using the legal categories of colonizing states. The aim is to be able to deepen our view of legal complexity through a careful analysis of the unequal power relations that arise when indigenous peoples use concepts and categories of epistemic communities that are in a better position to influence state regulatory and decision-making processes (von Benda-Beckmann and Turner 2018, 265). Considering the conversation above, a key contribution of this paper to legal pluralism studies is its proposal to examine problems of translation between normative orders through the concept of \"epistemic injustice.\" This will allow me to explore how translation and the politics of translation are shaping inequalities by manipulating the legal records of marginalized groups to undermine the validity of their claims and rights in environmental assessment procedures. Initially formulated by Fricker ( 2007), the concept of \"epistemic injustice\" refers to those forms of distinctly epistemic injustice (as opposed to economic or other forms of injustice), which occur when certain subjects or groups are harmed in their ability to know due to prejudicial stereotypes held against them. Under Fricker’s initial scheme, epistemic injustice can occur in the form of “testimonial” or “hermeneutic” injustice, the latter category being the most relevant for the purposes of this paper. Indeed, while testimonial injustice arises when someone is wronged in his or her capacity as a giver of knowledge, by unduly excluding him or her from the communal epistemic practices of sharing and pooling knowledge (Fricker 2021, 97); hermeneutic injustice occurs when certain disempowered individuals or groups are unable to make intelligible some aspect of their own social experience due to a “gap” in the available hermeneutic resources, as a consequence of a denial of full and equal participation in the social practices by which meanings are generated, leading to a structural identity bias or prejudice in the available collective hermeneutic resources (Fricker 2007, 237–258). In this way, the origin of hermeneutic injustice is structural -a hermeneutic background discrimination- it is situated in the unequal backgrounds of hermeneutic opportunities. What I am referring to is that some speakers are situated in an unfair and disadvantaged context, both to understand and to get others to understand this same experience of disadvantage (which is yet another form of indirect discrimination) (Fricker 2021). As several scholars have pointed out, the idea that one’s experience can be obscured from collective understanding could receive both a cognitivist and a communicative reading (Goetze 2018). In the cognitivist reading, which is given priority in Fricker’s early work, the “gap” that exists in hermeneutic resources renders one incapable of making sense of or understanding one’s experience (Lupin and Leo 2020, 7). Thus, victims of hermeneutic injustice find themselves having some social experiences through a “dark mirror”, with at best ill-fitting meanings to fall back on in the effort to make them intelligible (Fricker 2007, 240–241). In communicative reading, on the other hand, being unable to make one’s own experience intelligible is an issue that occurs when one is prevented from sharing with others some aspect of one’s experience that one understands perfectly well. While a hermeneutic “gap” also occurs in this case, it is not due to a gap in shared resources, but rather to a mismatch between the hermeneutic resources or the lack of a shared framework available to the speaker and the listener (Mason 2011; Medina 2012). Of course, this kind of communicative disadvantage is not usually an innocent gap -even if it remains unintentional in many cases (Fricker 2021, 99)- but rather a kind of blockage, of “hermeneutic domination” or “cultural imperialism”, through which the hermeneutic resources of the dominant group are actively imposed on those of the subaltern group (Young 1988; Catala 2015; Lupin and Townsend 2020; Dotson 2012) 1. As we will see from the case study presented in this paper, the cognitivist form of hermeneutic injustice is not what is involved in the difficulties indigenous peoples face in articulating their normative worlds through validated scientific languages in state decision-making processes. These peoples have highly developed knowledge systems through which they imagine their worlds and can understand and describe their experience and connection to their territories (Tsosie 2012; Tsosie 2017). In no way are they submerged in a kind of hermeneutic penumbra, nor is there a conceptual gap that hinders their self-understanding. Thus, the communicative form of hermeneutic injustice best captures the intuitive injustice that indigenous peoples face when they attempt to communicate a relevant parcel of their experience and legal sensibility to the state and dominant society. Fricker’s proposal to address epistemic injustice is through the cultivation of corrective virtues of an individual character: the virtues of “testimonial justice” and “hermeneutic justice”. The virtue of testimonial justice, according to Fricker, corresponds to a critical awareness that neutralizes the impact of bias on the virtuous hearer’s credibility judgments, and can be exercised by the virtuous hearer performing such actions as adjusting his credibility judgment upward or reserving his judgment when they suspect that bias may be influencing their evaluation of a witness’s words (Fricker 2007, 147–179). Regarding hermeneutic injustice, Fricker suggests that listeners can address it by giving speakers the epistemic benefit of doubt when they struggle to make something intelligible. In other words, the virtue of hermeneutic justice requires listeners to show a state of alertness or sensitivity to the possibility that the difficulty the speaker has when trying to make something communicatively intelligible is not because it is an absurdity, but rather because of some sort of gap in collective hermeneutic resources (Fricker 2021). However, this individual virtue is not enough to address the hermetic injustices we have identified as communicative. Indeed, in such cases, a change at the level of a single shared epistemic frame - a \"conceptual revolution\" - is not enough; rather, it is necessary for agents within an epistemic framework to look outside its boundaries, seeking alternative epistemic resources outside their current framework (Dotson 2012, 29–35). Consequently, by approaching my case study as a site of legal pluralism, I intend to put on an equal level the ways of knowing and the normative universes of the Mapuche-Williche communities of this territory and the legal system of the Chilean State (with logically ordered and hierarchical laws). While, by using the analytical lens of epistemic injustice, I seek to evidence the intuitive forms of injustice experienced by indigenous peoples when they attempt to communicate and make legible a relevant parcel of their experience and legal sensibility to the state and the dominant society. I will now present the two concepts through which this paper seeks to contribute to the study of the forms of epistemic injustice expressed in the coexistence and translation between normative orders in relation to my case study: legal culture and equivocation. Legal culture In assessing the contribution of legal pluralism to questions about the coexistence and translation of diverse legal orders, it is important to carefully define the units of analysis that constitute a legally plural field. One way of approaching legal cultures was developed by Clifford Geertz in the early 1980s. In Local Knowledge, Geertz argues that law “[…] is not a bounded set of norms, rules, principles, values, or whatever from which jural responses to distilled events can be drawn, but part of a distinctive manner of imagining the real” (Geertz 1983, 173). His assertion leads him to problematize the binary distinction between law and fact. Thus, instead of focusing our attention on rules or events, Geertz proposes to look at meaning, that is, the way in which individuals and groups “[…] make sense of what they do -practically, morally, expressively… juridically- by setting it within larger frames of signification, and how they keep those larger frames in place, or try to, by organizing what they do in terms of them” (Geertz 1983, 180). This hermeneutic turn in anthropology shifts toward a growing concern with the structures of meaning through which individuals and groups live their lives. This provides a way to contrast the different cultural spaces that constitute a juridically plural social field, offering a powerful analytical tool for examining the epistemic oppression experienced by indigenous peoples through state law. By comparing Islamic, Indic, and customary adat law in Indonesia, Geertz seeks to evoke a culture by choosing key terms and using them as avenues for exploring the symbol systems through which groups and individuals form, communicate, impose, share, alter or reproduce their normative worlds (Geertz 1983, 184 ss.). In this way, his analysis is based not on behavior but on cultural categories embedded in key terms. For example, to analyze how a given jurisdiction deals with day-to-day social problems and conflicts, this approach focuses on how it interprets them in terms of a particular “legal sensibility” which is where the revealing contrasts lie (Geertz 1983, 174–175). Law, Geertz argues, is “local knowledge”, “[…] vernacular characterizations of what happens connected to vernacular imaginings of what can” (Geertz 1983, 215). I will return to this in the following section. However, I think it is important to anticipate that the key terms I will be comparing are the legal categories of “site of cultural significance” and “ngen.” Cultural translation and its limits: the equivocation Approaching legal pluralism by understanding its constituent units as legal cultures -that is, as local knowledge that constructs social life rather than simply reflecting it- allows us to frame the hermeneutical problems of comparative analysis of law in terms of anthropology’s main analytical tool: cultural translation. As Eduardo Viveiros de Castro argues “[…] in anthropology, comparison is in the service of translation and not the opposite” (Castro 2004, 5). However, as Castro warns, “[…] direct comparability does not necessarily signify immediate translatability, just as ontological continuity does not imply epistemological transparency” (Castro 2004, 4). In this context, Castro proposes the notion of “equivocation” to reconceptualize the enterprise of translation in anthropology from a tradition anchored in an indigenous perspectivist cosmology. Perspectivism in this tradition does not refer to relativism in the same terms as multiculturalism, a subjective or cultural relativism; but to an objective or natural relativism, a “multinaturalism” (Castro 2004, 54). Amerindian ontologies are inherently comparative in that they presuppose a comparison between the ways in which different kinds of bodies naturally experience the world as an affective multiplicity. Thus, equivocation does not refer to a simple error or lack of understanding, but to the “[…] failure to understand that understandings are necessarily not the same, and that they are not related to imaginary ways of ‘seeing the world’ but to the real worlds that are being seen” (Castro 2004, 11). In that way, relations of equivocation go beyond divergent “perspectives” of the same world or comparison between different spatial or temporal instantiations of a given sociocultural form. Rather, they occur when visions of different worlds use homonymous terms to refer to things that are not the same (Cadena 2010, 350). The equivocations cannot be “corrected” or avoided, but they can be controlled. To this end, attention must be paid to the translation process - the terms and the respective differences - so that the “referential alterity” between the different positions is recognized and inserted into the conversation so that, instead of different visions of the same world (which would amount to cultural relativism), a vision of different worlds becomes evident (Castro 2004, 5). In other words, to translate is to assume that there is always an equivocation; it is to communicate through differences and to take seriously what the Other is saying in their effort to make himself understood, instead of silencing him by presuming a univocity -the essential similarity- between what the Other and We say (Castro 2004, 10). Thus, the aim of translation in this tradition is to highlight the differences that arise in a communicative disjunctive with other beings (human and non-human), opening, exploring, emphasizing and enhancing equivocality (Castro 2004, 11). In short, it is a matter of “[…] alien concepts to deform and subvert the translator’s conceptual toolbox so that the intentio of the original language can be expressed within the new one” (Castro 2004, 5). The notion of equivocation proposed by Castro implies a fruitful ontological turn to examine the complexity of juridical plurality when it is entangled with indigenous juridical mobilization. From a socio-legal perspective, the recognition of equivocality can shed light on the limits of the formal recognition of indigenous rights, offering a good entry point for the analysis and assessment of the often-overlapping ways in which indigenous peoples have been epistemically oppressed. In this way, by incorporating it into my analytical toolkit, I hope to present the ways through which the Williche imagine water and rivers, outside the realms of myth, folklore, and religious or multicultural tolerance (Cardoso and Pacheco-Pizarro 2021, 5). From this perspective, situating conflicts over water in Mapuche territory as ontological is not only a theoretical distinction, but has implications in the legal and political realms, influencing practical questions about how these conflicts are made legible in various institutional contexts and decisions are made (Cadena 2010). In the following section I present my case study. I begin with some historical background of the colonization process of the Mapuche-Wlliche territory between the Pilmaiquén and Chirre rivers. Then, I contextualize the concept of ngen to the particularities of the AzMapu (Mapuche law) of this territory, with the objective of approaching the meaning of water from the perspective of the Mapuche-Williche juridical sensibility. Finally, I explain how the dense cosmogony of the Mapuche-Williche communities is translated around water and its ngen during the environmental impact assessment process of the Osorno Hydroelectric Power Plant and what the impacts of this process have been over time. Case study: the Pilmaiken case Historical context of the Mapuche-Williche territory between the Pilmaiquén and Chirre Rivers In contrast to the Mapuche territory located north of the Toltén River -which enjoyed political and territorial autonomy until 1883-, by the end of the Spanish colonial period a significant part of the Futawillimapu (or “great southern territory”) had been dispossessed from ancestral residents as Hispanic hacienda ownership had begun to take hold (Comisión de Verdad Histórica y Nuevo Trato con los Pueblos Indígenas 2008, 445–448; Correa 2021, 227–233). After the independence of Chile in 1818, land buying intensified in the Futawillimapu, a phenomenon that lasted until the mid-1820s (Comisión de Verdad Histórica y Nuevo Trato con los Pueblos Indígenas 2008, 448). This process was facilitated by the deregulation of indigenous property sales. To safeguard the rights that the Chilean state claimed over the Williche territory, the government of Ramón Freire dictated the Act of June 10, 1923 (also known as the “Freire Act”), granting powers to the Intendant of Valdivia to designate a prominent neighbor to demarcate the Williche lands and deliver them “in perpetual and secure ownership”. It also mandates that “[…] the surplus lands belonging to the State be measured and appraised”, to be put up for “public auction” (Correa 2021, 234) 2. This process gave rise to the so-called “Títulos de Comisario” (Comisión de Trabajo Autónomo Mapuche 2008, 910–914). Under the protection of this legislation, between 1824 and 1832, some thirty “títulos de comisario’” were awarded to the pu lonko (the heads of Williche families), distributed along the coast of Osorno, in some sectors of the Bueno River (up the Pilmaiquén River) and La Unión, as well as on Ranco and Maihue lakes, recognizing an important part of the old Williche domains (Correa 2021, 234). However, from 1846 onwards, a fundamental event in the history of the territorial dispossession of the Futawillimapu took place: successive waves of German settlers began to disembark in Valdivia, as part of a settlement policy promoted by the Chilean State (Correa 2021, 237). In a context of deregulation of Mapuche-Williche lands (a situation that lasted until 1893 when the purchase of indigenous lands was prohibited), the settlers, with the complicity of the local authorities, would deploy a battery of usurpation methods that gave rise to the current private property in the Futawillimapu (Comisión de Trabajo Autónomo Mapuche 2008, 914–919; Comisión de Verdad Histórica y Nuevo Trato con los Pueblos Indígenas 2008, 450–455). What happened in the Williche territorial space between the rivers Chirre (to the north) and Pilmaiquén (to the south), in the current Los Ríos Region, is illustrative of this process of fraudulent constitution of property for the settlers’ benefit. Thus, when the Comisión Radicadora arrived in this territory between 1913 and 1917, settler property was already established and occupied almost all the available land. This meant that the old Williche families of Maihue, Carimallin and El Roble were displaced and reduced to the few spaces still available, with only 214 hectares, for 95 people distributed in five reservation (known as “Títulos de Merced” in favor of the families (mochulla) Mafil, Queulo, Malpu and Anchil; and 65 hectares in the Lumaco sector in the name of Mr. Pedro Marriao (Correa 2021, 265) (Map 1). Map 1. Mapuche-Williche territories between the pilmaiquén and chirre Rivers. Display full size In this process, the Mapuche-Williche families of this territory were not only reduced to quadrants that differed from their ancestral domains but were also displaced and pushed to the south of the Chirre River, away from the Pilmaiquén River. This implied the loss from their ancestral domains of both the territorial spaces that allowed their economic and material reproduction, as well as those of spiritual importance, including the ceremonial complex inhabited by the Ngen Mapu Kintuantü and Kilen Wentru, central tutelary spirits in the cosmovision of the Mapuche-Williche people, whose dwelling (renü) is located within the area that would be flooded by the construction of the Osorno Hydroelectric Power Plant (Correa 2021, 267). The following is a description of the dense normativity that exists around the natural ceremonial complex of which the Pilmaiquén River and the ngen of this territory are part of, with the purpose of contrasting how this normativity is introduced in the environmental impact assessment process of the Osorno Hydroelectric Power Plant. The natural-ceremonial complex Ngen Mapu Kintuantü and its AzMapu To approach the meaning of water from the legal sensibility of the Mapuche-Williche communities of the Pilmaiquén River and to understand the misunderstandings in this case, it is essential to note a few things about the concept of ngen from the Mapuche law or AzMapu 3. AzMapu -a term that includes both the constellations of norms and principles, as well as the investiture of the Mapuche people’s own authorities and institutions that apply and interpret them- refers to the organization of life and its complex link with the che (the Mapuche person), as well as its interaction with a given space and its internal distribution (Melin-Pehuen et al. 2016, 14). In this sense, AzMapu echoes the relationship between the material, spiritual and cultural dimensions of Mapuche life, where the “social” and “natural” worlds are interconnected in such a way that the transgression of the latter profoundly affects not only the social, but also this cosmopolitical node. Regarding water, in AzMapu there is a complex constellation of local rules, obligations and rights that reproduce a symbolic order about what water is and how people should relate to it, as well as to the various non-human (and more-than-human) beings that co-inhabit a territory (Melin-Pehuen et al. 2016, 109). In the Mapuche conception, water is part of the territory and, as such, cannot be the property of an individual and much less can it deprive the rest of the people and animals of the use and access to it, since doing so implies a transgression that must be remedied or rectified (Melin-Pehuen et al. 2016, 109). For the Mapuche “damaging the rivers is equivalent to damaging the veins of the Ñuke Mapu [Mother Earth]” (Elsa Panguilef, Lof Mapu Rupumeika, Oral communication, December 2018) Likewise, as has been widely documented, for the Mapuche, running water (Witrunko, in Mapuzungun) is known as a source of well-being for human and ecological bodies; on the contrary, stagnant water brings disease or illness (Comisión de Trabajo Autónomo Mapuche 2008, 1226; Cardoso and Pacheco-Pizarro 2021; Kelly 2021). This is the reason why the dammed waters generated by hydroelectric power plants in rivers have a meaning connected to transgression and a sense of attack. For the Mapuche, water -like the other elements of the territory- has its ngen (Caniullan and Mellico 2017, 44). Although one of the usual translations of the term ngen is “owner of the place”, rather than a subject “who has dominion or lordship over someone or something” (Real Academia Española, n.d., definition 1), “[…] the so-called ngen is a spiritual force proper to the place that is in relation to plants, minerals, humans, fungi, animals and water\" (Llancaman 2020, 5). From this perspective, the ngen “[…] are the guardians, governors or regulators of a given territory…” (Machi Millaray Huichalaf, Oral communication, January 30th, 2021); who exist independently of humans, but who must be asked for permission, as well as express gratitude and respect for their sanctioning power (Sánchez 2001). These guardians configure the ordering (Az) of water (Ko), that is, its own characteristic which, in its constant relationship with che, establishes material and immaterial links that delimit and order the inhabited spaces, and which are manifested mainly in the spiritual, health and ceremonial spheres, among others. From this perspective, the concept of ngen is central to understanding the Az of water, and abusing this element implies violating the care and transgressing the duties towards its rulers, which brings with it sanctions towards the transgressors and the communities. This can be clearly seen in the case of the natural ceremonial complex around the Pilmaiquén river and the ngen Kintuantü and Kilen Wentru. The dwelling (renü) of the ngen Kintuantü and Kilen Wentru is located on the south bank of the Pilmaiquén River, in the sector of Maihue-Carimallin, in Río Bueno, in the current Los Ríos Region. The dwelling of Kintuantü and Kilen Wentru is part of a sacred complex of Mapuche-Williche ceremonial use, which constitutes a unit with the old cemetery (eltuwe) that exists in Maihue, the prayer field (gillatuwe) and the Pilmaiquén River, one of the main tributaries of the Wenuleufu (the “river from the sky”), name with which the river Bueno is called in Mapuzungun (Moulian and Espinoza 2015). In the words of Machi Millaray Huichalaf, all these elements: […] are physically and symbolically related by the amunkowe (movement of the waters) that marks the path followed by the spirits in the direction of the wenu mapu (the land of the sky). In […] the dwellings of Kintuantü and Kilen Wentru there is an upwelling of waters that flow below the cemetery. Its course, protected by an ancient native forest and wetland, leads to the Pilmaiquén River, which flows into the […] Wenu Leufu […], forming a spiritual path linking the kuifikeche (ancestors) with the ngen mapu, whose transcendent character must be cared for through the periodic practice of prayers in the ancient ngillatuwe located in the vicinity of the cemetery (Huichalaf 2019). This sacred complex has the particularity of containing spirits considered “twins”, which work with different but complementary energies and functions (Correa, Morales, and Moulian 2012). Kilen Wentru is a Ngen Machi, in charge of attending to the health needs of the members of the communities. Kintuantü is the tutelary Ngen Mapu of the territory, in charge of overseeing the socio-cultural and economic well-being of the communities. This duality makes this space a ceremonial complex of permanent use. Throughout the year, people in need of health, individually and collectively, go to the site to invoke the help of Kilen Wentru and take the water that flows from its renü. Also, according to local tradition, the ritual congregations are obliged to visit Kintuantü once or twice during the summer period, prior to the ngillatun, but they also go to him in case of conflicts, spiritual or political orientation needs, economic or environmental problems. Likewise, the dwelling of the Ngen Mapu Kintuantü is linked to other spaces of spiritual importance, such as the volcanic Cordon Caulle, as well as other ngen, as is the case of his sister and brother, Mari Antu and Grandfather Wuentiao, whose dwellings are in Mantilhue, on the north shore of Puyehue lake, and Pucatrihue, in the coastal sector of San Juan de la Costa, respectively. These relationships form a spiritual chain that extends along the Fütawillimapu and connects the coastal communities with those located in the valleys and the mountain range (Millahueque 2011). These connections, which follow the natural order of the watershed, imply that there is a permanent pilgrimage to request permission from the Ngen Mapu Kintuantü and that the various ceremonies that take place in this extensive territory are carried out in the direction of his dwelling place (Correa, Morales, and Moulian 2012). As noted, although the ancient ownership of the land where the dwelling of the Ngen Kintuantü is located belongs by ancestral right to the Mapuche-Williche lineages of the El Roble/Maihue/Carimallin territories, in the context of the colonization of this territory it was taken away from them. However, this did not prevent the communities from continuing to use this space for their ceremonial activities, since, through informal agreements, the successive legal owners tolerated the access of the local Mapuche congregations to this important ceremonial complex. This situation changed radically when the hydroelectric power plants of Empresa Eléctrica Pilmaiquén S.A. (EEP) entered the Environmental Impact Assessment System (EIAS). The following section will examine how the dense cosmogony surrounding this spiritual assemblage is made legible in the context of the environmental assessment procedure of the Osorno Hydroelectric Power Plant on the Pilmaiquén River, through the category of “site of cultural significance”, and the impacts this has had over the years in which this conflict has developed. The conflict of Statkraft’s hydroelectric power plants on the Pilmaiquén River Although the current conflict over the development of the hydroelectric potential of the Pilmaiquén River involves three hydroelectric power plants owned by EEP -controlled since 2014 by the Norwegian state-owned Statkraft through its Chilean subsidiary Statkraft Chile Inversiones Eléctricas Ltda. (Statkraft 2022)-, it was during the environmental assessment of the Osorno Hydroelectric Power Plant where the discussion about the impacts that these projects have on the Kintuantü and Kilen Wentru emerged for the first time, as a consequence of the direct flooding of an important part of this natural Mapuche-Williche complex of ceremonial use 4. While the focus of my analysis is on the Osorno Power Plant, I do not intend to ignore the impacts that the other projects have on the natural ceremonial Williche center that exists in this territory, which, as noted, is part of the Pilmaiquén River. When EEP submitted the Environmental Impact Study (EIS) for the Osorno Generating project to the EIAS in 2007 (58.2 MW), it declared that: “[i]n the area of influence of the project there are no […] legally constituted Mapuche indigenous communities, or of any other ethnicity” (Empresa Eléctrica Pilmaiquén S.A 2007). This filing made this claim despite implying the intervention and flooding of an important part of the Mapuche-Williche natural ceremonial center linked to the dwelling of the Ngen Mapu Kintuantü, which at that time was well known by various state institutions. Along with demonstrating the lack of prior research by the company, these claims resulted in the absolute invisibility of the Mapuche-Williche communities in this territory, which also meant that no measures were considered to address the impacts on the natural ceremonial complex (Correa 2011). This deficiency was noted during the environmental assessment of this project by the National Indigenous Development Corporation (“CONADI” for its acronym in Spanish), the state agency in charge of indigenous policy in Chile. It is in this context that the natural complex of ceremonial use that exists around the river and ngen is made visible for the first time as a “site of cultural significance”, category used by CONADI to, in the context of its legal mandate, refer to those places of special protection located “[…] within or outside of indigenous communities that are relevant to their members, because they are linked to their beliefs, histories and customs, with their past or present cultural manifestations, which lead to a feeling of social cohesion and of belonging and identification to a determined group” (Pozo and Millanao 2022, 17). According to CONADI: The EIS of the Osorno hydroelectric power plant, has not implemented the necessary actions to investigate the existence of sites of cultural significance, in this sense, it should be mentioned that local communities, such as, the indigenous communities of Maihue Pilmaiquen, el Roble and Mantilhue, have indicated the existence of sacred sites near the banks of the Pilmaiquén river, which are in potential danger, with the installation of the power plant (Corporación Nacional de Desarrollo Indígena 2007). This forced EEP to update its baseline study through new field inquiries. In this context, the owner unilaterally identified three indigenous communities with legal personality and limited the impact of the flooding of the sacred natural complex that exists around the river and the ngen of this territory, to a problem of access for ceremonial practices. As a result, EEP proposed the filling of the terrace that is part of the dwelling of the Ngen Mapu Kintuantü as a measure to mitigate this impact, so that the ritual congregations can continue accessing the site to carry out their prayers (Empresa Eléctrica Pilmaiquén S.A 2008, Anexos K y I). This was again objected to by CONADI. Given that the environmental assessment of this project coincided with Chile’s ratification of ILO Convention 169, this agency requested “[…] by virtue […] of Act 19,253 [Indigenous Act] and […] ILO Convention 169, the participation of the Indigenous Communities associated with the Kintuante Site of Cultural Significance is required for the process of designing a site mitigation plan” (Corporación Nacional de Desarrollo Indígena 2008). In addition, CONADI stated that this “process of information and participation of the indigenous communities” should include “[…] both the Ancestral, Religious and Traditional Authorities and the indigenous population in general”, and inform “[…] about the implementation of the project and its environmental impacts […], since the information gathered in the field by CONADI indicates a lack of knowledge of the indigenous population surrounding the project” (Corporación Nacional de Desarrollo Indígena 2008). Finally, CONADI claimed that this participation process should “[…] be carried out in good faith, as mentioned in Article 6 of ILO Convention 169, through adequate and relevant means for the population in question, in order to ensure that the communities correctly understand the potential impact of the project and that they give their opinion and consent to the reparation and/or mitigation measures that the owner commits to” (Corporación Nacional de Desarrollo Indígena 2008). However, as the ILO Convention 169 was to enter into force twelve months after the instrument of ratification was filed with the ILO, EEP pressured the environmental authority at the time (CONAMA) to avoid the implementation of participation and consultation mechanisms with the indigenous institutions representing the territory. To this end, the proponent submitted several notarized minutes of meetings where the legal representatives of the indigenous organizations unilaterally identified by EEP gave their approval to the mitigation plan proposed by the company (Empresa Eléctrica Pilmaiquén S.A 2009). On June 30, 2009, two and a half months before the ILO Convention 169 entered into full force in Chile, CONAMA decided to approve the Osorno Hydroelectric Power Plant without implementing a prior consultation process but establishing as a condition for its execution the obligation that the owner must: […] submit, prior to the start of the Project, Meeting Minutes that demonstrate the consent of the 3 indigenous communities identified within the baseline for the Human Environment study with respect to the mitigation measures, and which are associated with the site of cultural significance ‘Kintuante’. This documentation must be submitted to CONADI, and must contain the consent of the ancestral authorities of the area, of the directives of these communities and of the related partners (Comisión Nacional del Medio Ambiente 2009, considerando 12.2). This decision implied that the Chilean state delegated its obligation to implement a consultation process to a private company, providing legal support for EEP to continue negotiating with the representatives of the indigenous organizations with legal personality that it had unilaterally identified during the environmental assessment of the project. Effectively, this undermined the representation of the ancestral authorities of the territory and deepened the internal fractures between families and communities. Conflict in the territory came to a head in 2011, when the then owner of the land where the Ngen Mapu Kintuantü dwelling was located, restricted access to the communities and began to illegally cut down the native forest that protected it. To stop the destruction of the natural ceremonial complex, the Mapuche-Williche communities and ancestral authorities of the territory asked CONADI to buy the land (Comunidades de El Roble-Carimallin y Mantilhue 2011) and filed a protective action with the Court of Appeals of Valdivia. As the conflict intensified, the communities entered the property to stop the settler’s actions. Although the appeal for protection filed by the communities was accepted in the first instance by the Court of Appeals of Valdivia, ordering the settler “[…] to cease his activities of illegal logging of ancient trees […] and to allow the petitioners free access to the ceremonial site […] during the summer season and for the sole purpose of performing prayers” (Millaray Huichalaf Pradines y Otros C/Juan H. Ortiz Ortiz 2012); finally the Supreme Court decided to reject it, considering that the occupation of the land in conflict by the communities constituted an exercise of \"self-protection\" unacceptable in the light of the constitutional order in force, which violated the property rights of the current owner (Millaray Huichalaf Pradines y Otros CONTRA Juan H. Ortiz Ortiz 2012). Once again, the conflict around the ceremonial natural complex that exists around the Pilmaiquén river and the Ngen Kintuantü was reduced to a problem of access to the “site” for the development of religious activities, and where pre-eminence in the event of a collision between the Mapuche ancestral property right and the private property of the settler is held by the latter. In parallel, in 2012, EEP bought the land where the dwelling of the Ngen Kintuantü is located, with the objective of complying with the condition imposed in the environmental permit of the project (Empresa Eléctrica Pilmaiquén S.A 2013). The company began to meet with the indigenous organizations identified in its baseline study and promised restitution of the land. However, these meetings took place during a period of high criminalization in the area, with ancestral leaders and authorities being charged with crimes and some deprived of their liberty. This was the case of Machi Millaray, who, by openly rejecting the project, began to be investigated and criminally prosecuted (Castillo and Ramirez 2017, 68). Given that this conflict coincided with the implementation of the new environmental institutions in Chile 5, following a complaint made by organizations and ancestral authorities of the territory, in 2016, the Superintendence of the Environment (“SMA” for its acronym in Spanish) determined that the minutes presented by the company in 2014 did not fulfill its obligation to obtain the consent of the communities identified during the evaluation regarding the mitigation measure associated with the site of cultural significance, as required by the environmental permit for the Osorno Plant. The SMA also observed that it was not possible to determine whether the methodology used by EEP complied with the standards of ILO Convention 169 and whether the participation process should only include organizations with legal status identified unilaterally by the company (Superintendencia del Medio Ambiente 2016). Consequently, the SMA requested the Environmental Evaluation Service (“SEA” for its acronym in Spanish) to administratively interpret this issue. Based on this administrative consultation, the SEA validated the criteria used by the EEP to determine which communities could participate in this indigenous participation procedure. Along with the above, the SEA pointed out that this participation process was not an indigenous consultation as such, since it was an obligation of the company, but that both the methodology and the meaning and scope of the term \"consent\" in the permit environment should comply with ILO Convention 169 and the national regulation of the indigenous right to prior consultation (Servicio de Evaluación Ambiental 2016). To reverse this judgement, Machi Millaray, together with the Koyam Ke Che Community and the Wenuleufu Association, opposed this decision before the Second Environmental Court, arguing that the SEA had illegally omitted the technical opinion of CONADI, and that the obligation to implement an indigenous consultation process was a duty of the Chilean state and not of a private company. This action was accepted by the Second Environmental Court (Huichalaf Pradines Millaray y otro/Dirección ejecutiva del Servicio de Evaluación Ambiental (Res. Ex. N° 0711 and de 6 de junio de 2018) 2018) 2020) and subsequently confirmed by the Supreme Court (Huichalaf/Servicio de Evaluación Ambiental 2020), ordering the SEA to reopen the procedure for interpretation of the RCA, this time with CONADI’s pronouncement to clarify the controversial aspects of the environmental license. Although Statkraft recently announced that it had renounced the environmental permit for the Osorno power plant -given its impacts on the “site of cultural significance” inhabited by the Ngen Kintuantü, prioritizing the construction of the Los Lagos power plant (M.T.G., interview, April 10, 2023)-, the negotiations initiated by EEP (and continued by Statkraft) have led to internal divisions that have had lasting effects on the forms of representation of the ancestral organizations and authorities of the territory (Kelly, Guerra-Schleef, and Valdés-Negroni 2021). From this process, new indigenous communities with legal status have emerged, such as Koyam Ke Che, which organizes the dissident families of El Roble, which, together with indigenous community Leufu Pilmaiquén Maihue, have organized opposition to the company’s hydroelectric projects on the Pilmaiquén River. However, this shows the fractures in the families and sociological communities of these territories, where the cleavage has been the support or rejection of the hydroelectric projects. The conflict over indigenous representation also led to the creation of the Wenuleufu Association, which brings together several pu Lonko of the territory, as well as 47 communities with legal status in the commune of Río Bueno. In 2014 Statkraft purchased the hydroelectric projects, water rights, and land rights of the project (Maria Teresa González, interview, April 10, 2023). As other scholars have demonstrated, a market exists in Chile for purchasing water rights with approved EISs (Kelly and Negroni 2020). As the current landowner, Statkraft has upheld EEP’s refusal to sell to CONADI the lands where a fundamental part of the natural complex for ceremonial use around the Pilmaiquén river is located (Empresa Eléctrica Pilmaiquén S.A 2013), arguing that they have acquired these lands for the purpose of handing over the ceremonial area to the indigenous communities (Empresa Eléctrica Pilmaiquén S.A./Statkraft Chile Inversiones Electricas Ltda. 2021a). Relatedly, in 2018 Statkraft circulated a proposal with the main organizations and ancestral authorities who represent the territory, requesting that they identify the legal figure that would hold title to the transfer (Statkraft 2018). This has been used by CONADI as an excuse to advance in the purchase procedure, the only mechanism contemplated in the Chilean legal system to solve this type of territorial conflicts, granting to the company -Statkraft- the responsibility of defining when, how and to whom the registered ownership of the central part of the ceremonial complex where the Kintuantü inhabits will be assigned (Corporación Nacional de Desarrollo Indígena 2021). As a lawyer collaborating with the ancestral authorities and Mapuche-Williche communities that oppose these hydroelectric projects, I have been able to observe how, as the conflict has escalated and the communities have used the institutional mechanisms available to exercise their rights, this company has strategically used its commitment to restore the land where Ngen Mapu Kintuantü’s house is located. Effectively, they have favored those people with whom it has negotiated since the environmental evaluation of the Osorno Power Plant and forced confrontation with the communities of the territory around the ownership of this important complex Mapuche-Williche ceremonial. It is important to note that Statkraft has not only inherited the negotiations and agreements, but has maintained and used them strategically in the context of the construction of the Los Lagos power plant, taking an active role in direct negotiation with the communities, appealing both to the condition imposed in the environmental permit for the Osorno power plant and to its corporate commitments to the human rights of indigenous peoples (Statkraft 2022, 66). However, the ancestral authorities and Mapuche-Williche organizations that oppose these projects (Empresa Eléctrica Pilmaiquén S.A./Statkraft Chile Inversiones Eléctricas Ltda 2021a) have refused to participate in the company’s dialogue, arguing that it would be a strategy that only seeks to confront local communities around the ownership of part of the ceremonial natural complex, in circumstances where the responsibility for the return of this sacred space is an obligation of the Chilean State (Aylwin, Didier, and Guerra 2019, 65–66). An important milestone in this process occurred in May 2021, when the ancestral authorities and Mapuche-Williche communities that oppose the hydroelectric plants on the Pilmaiquén River became aware of Statkraft’s unilateral decision to transfer the land where the Ngen Mapu Kintuantü is located to an indigenous association with legal personality called Señor Kintuantü, recently created with the support of the company. In the words of a Statkraft representative in Chile, this organization would group together the lepunero who would be “the true ancestral authorities of the territory” (K.O., interview, April 10, 2023). This occurred in the context of a consultancy research commissioned by Statkraft and carried out by a Chilean academic institution to identify the organization that would be the owner of the transfer (Empresa Eléctrica Pilmaiquén S.A./Statkraft Chile Inversiones Eléctricas Ltda 2021a). However, I have also observed that while Statkraft has negotiated and articulated support in the communities closest to the proposed power plants and maintained the strategy launched in the context of the environmental assessment of the Osorno Power Plant; the ancestral organizations and authorities that oppose these initiatives have revitalized political alliances with the communities of the extensive territory for which the Ngen Mapu Kintuantü is a spiritual reference, as is the case of those located around the Caulle Volcanic Range and in the coast. In short, even though Statkraft’s strategy of transferring ownership of the land where Ngen Kintuantü’s residence is located is currently paralyzed by a Supreme Court ruling 6, I have been able to verify how community relations nearest to hydroelectric development have deteriorated and conflicts between families and community members have become more acute. Likewise, profound changes are evident in the forms of Mapuche-Williche representation of the territory. The use of institutional and legal mechanisms by ancestral organizations and authorities that oppose Statkraft’s initiatives in the Pilmaiquén River 7 has led the company to support the creation of new indigenous organizations with legal personality in the territory that are functional to the interests of the company. In this way, negotiations have modified community interactions for more than 15 years, causing fractures and divisions in families that will last for a long time (Kelly, Guerra-Schleef, and Valdés-Negroni 2021). The continuous interventions have generated friction in the territory and have consolidated the divisions between the various organizations that have arisen as the conflict has developed in the basin. This, of course, does not mean that there is perfect unity among those who oppose Statkraft’s projects. There is a history of alliances and divisions, at the center of which are the interventions and negotiations of the company that owns the Los Lagos and Osorno power plants. Discussion: the Pilmaiken case as a site of legal pluralism In this section I discuss the limits of the translation process that has taken place in my case study, exploring two equivocations that are made explicit in this case. First equivocal site: from ngen to “site of cultural significance” To understand the problems of hermeneutic injustice, as well as the complexities and interrelationships that exist at the heart of the Pilmaiken case as a site of legal pluralism, we must first explore the ontological aspects that define each of the legal spheres that are interacting in this territory. This allows us to examine the equivocations that emerge from this conflict that affect the way in which the impacts of these projects on the river, communities and ngen are understood. When we turn to the AzMapu of the ceremonial complex inhabited by the Ngen Kintuantü and Kilen Wentru, it is possible to observe how water is considered not only as H2O or a natural resource available for exploitation, but as a profoundly important actor in the realization of all aspects of life, as well as an assembling force between human and non-human collectives, connecting the living with their ancestors. In this way, the fragmentation of the Pilmaiquén river for the Mapuche communities is not only the loss of a productive resource, but also has a series of impacts on the normative world of the communities, the Ngen Mapu and the forces (newen) that maintain the cosmic balances between human beings (past, present and future) and non-human beings that inhabit the territory. As noted, for Geertz ( 1983) worldviews are always normative and, consequently, empirical experiences are inevitably interwoven with the symbolic worlds we inhabit. In relation to the case study, the local norms, rights, and obligations that regulate how water should be managed, reflect, and reproduce a symbolic order regarding what water is and how people should relate to it. This symbolic order is based on concrete ethics and shared values that are rooted in the material relationships among people, watercourses and ngen mapu, where obligations are not separate to water-related traditions and customs. Thus, the spiritual geography of the ngen is at the same time a geographical representation of the normative world of the communities, which is central to understanding how they contextualize the impacts of hydropower plants both in relation to themselves and to the river. The rules, rights, and obligations of communities, as well as their vernacular ways of imagining water, are not pre-political, nor are they frozen in time and space, nor are they purely cultural. They are always becoming something different in relation to the political-economic processes, power relations and conflicts where they are located. That is why the Williche communities are constantly transforming and mobilizing their normative worlds, as a way of confronting the state law that aims to standardize how water should be managed and, more specifically, to evaluate the environmental impacts that certain development projects may have on rivers. Considering the EIAS as a privileged site where the conflict we are studying has been channeled, this mobilization has occurred within a certain political economy of water reproduced by state rules, rights and obligations that present water under the state and neoliberal symbolic order: as a resource that can be freely appropriated and traded, and that can be managed regardless of who the holders of the land rights are. It is at this point where a first equivocation or hermeneutic problem of translation arises between the different legal spheres and sensibilities that are interacting in this case. As noted, defining the term ngen from the perspective of the communities, as well as the dense cosmogony surrounding the natural complex for ceremonial use that exist around Pilmaiquén river, is an extremely complex task. This is the reason why, to make this reality understandable for the environmental institutions in the environmental assessment, the concept of “site of cultural significance” is used. However, as Llancaman points out: From ngen to ‘site’ there is a considerable distance. A site […] can be measured and identified in coordinates, it is thus delimited and enclosed. The ngen on the other hand cannot be understood as contained in limits, it represents in every sense an excess […]. Ngen is in-common […], and from my perspective, the first word about ngen is that even when it includes human beings, it does not depend on them, and in turn the human cannot be conceived as separate from the first (Llancaman 2020, 5). The need to prefer the reference to “site of cultural significance” instead of ngen, is also operated in the environmental assessment, as well as in other spheres of state law, by the anthropological language of religious practice. Although this code external to the communities allows, to a certain extent, the ngen to enter the technical environmental discussion, it organizes the normative Williche worlds on the side of religious practice, reinforcing the old western division between nature and culture and subtracting the complex meanings of the original word to the choice of the institutional observer (Llancaman 2020; Kelly, Guerra-Schleef, and Valdés-Negroni 2021). Such was the reading that finally prevailed in the evaluation of the Central Osorno. Thus, it was enough for the owner to propose the filling of the alluvial terrace that is part of the dwelling of the Ngen Kintuantü, so that the communities could continue accessing the place to practice their prayers, for the impacts to be considered as minimized from the perspective of the State and the company. This reduction of significance is understandable within the dynamics of the conflict: the category “site of cultural significance” is a criterion that can be admitted as an argument for environmental institutions since it is comparable and measurable. In view of the need to exchange information and communicate experiences about living in space, the communities can accept the reduction of the new term, even if it is insufficient. In other words, mediation through religious practice is the way state regulation incorporates the contents of the normative Williche worlds, but via foreign categories (Tsosie 2012; Tsosie 2017). However, this way of understanding the impacts of this project is based on a fragmentary understanding of the territory (Kelly, Guerra-Schleef, and Valdés-Negroni 2021), which is produced by a mismatch between discursive practices that make central aspects of the experience of the affected communities unintelligible to the environmental assessment. As we have seen, the sacred spaces that the communities have fought to protect are not only “land” or “water”, but they are also more than that; they are the river, known people, guardian beings, forces and living beings (Cadena 2015). Therefore, the water of this territory cannot be treated as a mere object over which a person can claim ownership, to be managed independently of the other beings (human and non-human) that inhabit the territory. Thinking of rivers and water in Mapuche-Williche territories (whether or not labeled as \"sacred\") as places of equivocation –which allow circuits between partially connected worlds, without necessarily creating a unified system- can help to become aware of how the Chilean legal system transforms indigenous socio-natural worlds in its attempt to make them legible within its conceptual coordinates. As Marisol de la Cadena ( 2010) argues, when we do not become aware that rivers (or any other entity whose meaning we do not doubt) are equivocal, the dispute is interpreted as a \"problem between two cultures\" rather than an ontological controversy (351–352). In this way, the destiny of the river and the ngen mapu is defined by the only culture that, claiming universal principles, provides \"technical\" solutions that, however, are incapable of avoiding possible local deaths. Thus, if we want to obtain different results, we must take the problem to a different plane; to the political moment in which the ontological division between humans and nature arises and creates politics as a human affair and relegates nature to scientific representation. Seen from this perspective -which reveals the epistemic politics of modern politics- the conflict would change and, instead of a cultural problem between universal progress and local \"beliefs\", the fate of the river and the ngen mapu emerges as a conflict between worlds, requiring symmetrical disagreement. In other words, by mobilizing the river and its ngen as sensitive entities, the Mapuche-Williche communities and ancestral authorities of this territory do not invoke a “belief” (which reproduces the Western dualism “science/belief” or “nature/culture”); but, as Escobar argues, “[…] from a whole episteme and ontology that do not function on the basis of these binaries” (Escobar 2014, 117). In this “relational ontologies”, as Escobar calls them, humans, and non-humans (the organic, the non-organic, and the supernatural or spiritual) form an integral part of the world of the communities of this territory in their multiple interrelationships as sentient beings (Escobar 2014). Second equivocal site: spatial logics of impact Relatedly, a second equivocation emerges in this case related to the various spatial logics that interact in this case, which, in my opinion, demonstrates that the Chilean state is not the only actor that is giving meaning to indigenous rights. As discussed, in this case it was the incumbent company that ultimately determined the spatial scope of its project’s affectation, enacting a key state administrative practice, such as defining who will be considered as affected and, therefore, as interested persons: holders of rights and interests that will be compromised with the implementation of the project. As shown in the Pilmaiken case, the company strategically took advantage of this situation, identifying as directly affected only the closest indigenous communities with the legal status and with which it has negotiated. This strategy, as we have seen, was validated by the Chilean state in the framework of the environmental assessment of the Osorno Power Plant and, even though this project is currently abandoned, it has been projected in time beyond this administrative procedure. This is evident in the way in which this company has used its previous negotiations with the communities that it itself identified as affected during the environmental evaluation process of the Osorno Power Plant and the property it maintains on the land where Ngen Kintuantü’s residence is located, in the context of the development and construction of the Los Lagos Power Plant. However, this spatial logic defined by the company in charge of these projects is opposed to the broader spiritual and legal geography of the natural complex of ceremonial use that exists around the Pilmaiquén River. Indeed, in contrast to the State’s and the company’s drive to spatially limit the impacts - and, consequently, who is affected - the communities that oppose these hydroelectric projects claim that the river, the ngen and all the communities whose territories make up the spiritual chain around this natural ceremonial center are affected. This is because, although the communities closest to the Ngen Kintuantü play the role of custodians of the space, they are not the “owners” of the site, insofar as ownership of the ngen is inconceivable from their AzMapu. From this perspective, it is not enough for the owner company to negotiate the consent of some families and nearby communities to validate the intervention of this ceremonial complex, since what is at stake in this case is a territory in its broad material, epistemic, cultural, and ontological conception. Conclusions In this paper I have used various analytical tools from anthropology to construct a framework that allows us to examine the problems of structural hermeneutic injustice that emerge in the Pilmaiken case as a site of legal pluralism. I have focused my analysis on two equivocations arising from the process through which the environmental institutionality translated the dense normativity of the Mapuche-Williche communities around the Pilmaiquén River and the Ngen Mapu Kintuantü during the environmental assessment of the Osorno Hydroelectric Power Plant, with the aim of making the impacts of this project legible in this institutional context. As I argued, in this case, the institutional translation of ngen to “site of cultural significance”, as well as the company’s subsequent proposal to fill in the terrace that is part of the dwelling of the Ngen Mapu Kintuantü, reproduced a structural form of epistemic injustice of a hermeneutic type, reflecting the political and business impulse behind dominant multiculturalism, which continues to reduce the normative and juridical worlds of indigenous peoples to mere folklore, to a mere belief that belongs to another “culture”. This, moreover, has had long-lasting effects on the way in which the company and the environmental institutions have understood the spatial dimension of the impacts of these projects in relation to the communities linked to the natural ceremonial complex that exists around the Pilmaiquén River. Now, with this I do not mean to argue that the category of “site of cultural significance” cannot be re-signified and epistemically decolonized in a new scenario. However, to move in this direction it is essential to be aware of the Western religious discourse and practice that operates through this category, which reproduces models of thought based on a dualistic rationality: the nature/culture binary. The change of shared understandings is not an automatic process of hermeneutical redefinition but requires political actions aimed at disrupting the power relations that underlie these understandings, making visible exclusion, institutional violence and what Pohlhaus has called “willful hermeneutical ignorance” (Pohlhaus 2012). In this sense, I consider that both Fricker’s analytical lens on epistemic injustice and the development of contemporary studies on legal pluralism, can help us illuminate forms of injustice that are often invisible to all but the affected groups. From this perspective, the emphasis placed on legal pluralism allows us to contest and decentralize state law, as a privileged site where collective meanings are generated in contemporary societies. As Rebecca Tsosie argues, by naming what is happening, contesting dominant ways of imagining the real, and reconceptualizing the ways in which we must relate to each other and to our environment, indigenous peoples could engage in a cross-cultural understanding of state legal categories (Tsosie 2017, 366). Indigenous peoples understand time and place differently and possess unique forms of knowledge and legal systems of their own that are rooted in long-standing genealogical relationships with the territories they have inhabited. This allows them to make visible what informs their realities and worlds. However, for this to happen, it is essential that internationally and nationally guaranteed indigenous rights enable the necessary and appropriate spaces for intercultural dialogue for the decolonization of state juridical categories. In short, it is a matter of understanding that the different peoples who live within the geopolitical space defined by current state borders have different epistemic frameworks with respect to which they imagine their worlds and live their lives, and that it is necessary to build bridges of communication between these worlds to generate fairer representations of them. These types of changes are extremely complex and difficult to achieve, since, as Mariana Ortega points out, they imply really engaging in activities in which one will experience what others experience; understanding problems from their perspectives and imagining what their worlds mean (difficult as this is); deal with people of flesh and blood, and not only with their theoretical constructions; learn the language of the people to understand them better and not use it against them; really listening to other people’s interpretations, however different they may be from your own; and see people as worthy of respect instead of helpless beings who need help (Ortega 2006, 69). It is, finally, an embodied commitment, in which we expose ourselves to a form of communication that is not simply analogical, but transconceptual. From this perspective, intercultural dialogue is a call to “travel”, to try to experience and understand the “world” of others who are different; open the possibility of crossing cultural, racial and ethnic boundaries (Ortega 2006, 68–69). Moreover, as Mariana Ortega points out, it seems that those who “travel the world” the most are already marginalized beings, since they are the ones who are usually forced to travel to the dominant world (Ortega 2006, 69). The question, then, is how to convince those who are part of the dominant world to travel to marginalized worlds? As the Pilmaiken case shows, marginally situated communities have elaborate epistemic resources that resist a distorted sense of knowing and making known their normative worlds around the river and water. The solution is for the dominant situated institutional knowers to catch up and learn to use the epistemic resources they lack by forging interdependent and truly cooperative relationships with the marginally situated knowers. In this context, I believe that Fricker’s proposal to address forms of epistemic injustice exclusively through the cultivation of individual corrective virtues is insufficient to redress the structural forms of epistemic injustice experienced by indigenous peoples within the settler societies in which they currently live. This is the reason why, rather than solutions focused on individual virtues, the remedy that international human rights law has articulated to address these situations has been through what Anderson identifies as \"structural remedies\" (Anderson 2012). This includes indigenous peoples’ rights of participation and consent, which allow indigenous peoples to speak for themselves, collectively (through their representative institutions), using their own methodologies of deliberation and decision-making.

Notes 1 Those who have drawn attention to this latter form of hermeneutic injustice emphasize that there is not a single, fully collective set of hermeneutic resources assembled in a set that is shared by all, but rather a plurality of discursive practices developed by different groups of greater or lesser social power. See: Dotson 2012; Medina 2012; Lupin and Leo 2020. 2 This translation, as well as the others in this work, are free translations by the author. 3 The notion of Az - which from the polysemy of Mapuzugun captures different dimensions and meanings- refers to the ordering of things, social life, cultural practices, and ceremonies, as well as the cycles of life (mogen); while the notion of Mapu refers to the space where life is reproduced in its various forms and manifestations (Melin-Pehuen et al. 2016, 20-21). 4 Currently, the Norwegian state-owned company Statkraft, through its Chilean firm EEP, operates the Rucatayo hydroelectric plant on the Pilmaiquén river, which obtained its environmental qualification in 2006, and plans the construction of two other hydroelectric plants downstream on the same river: the Los Lagos and Osorno hydroelectric plants. These hydroelectric plants, together with the transmission line, were environmentally assessed in parallel but separately, both obtaining their environmental permits in June 2009. in this way, the synergistic and cumulative impacts of these projects, which are part of the same hydroelectric development plan in the Pilmaiquén river basin, were not considered. 5 The current environmental institutional framework is based on the reforms introduced by Act 20,417 of 2010 to Act 19,300 on General Bases of the Environment, which created the Ministry of the Environment (in charge of environmental regulation and policy), the SMA (with oversight and sanction functions) and the Environmental Evaluation Service (in charge of environmental evaluation). The Act also conditioned the entry into force of the SMA with the creation of the Environmental Courts (Act 20,600 of 2012). 6 Through its judgment of January 20, 2022, the Supreme Court accepted the protective measure filed by Machi Millaray, the Koyam Ke Che and Leufu Pilmaiquén Maihue indigenous communities, and the Puyehue Community Council, ordering CONADI to proceed progressively to the petition of the defendants regarding the Ngen Mapu Kintuantü Ceremonial Center, considering the interests of all the Mapuche-Williche communities linked to this sacred natural space. This made it possible to paralyze the transfer that Statkraft had been promoting up to that moment (Comunidad Indígena Leufu Pilmaiquén Maihue/Statkraft Chile Inversiones Eléctricas Limitada 2022). 7 In this regard, an important case has been the protective measure filed by Machi Millaray and the Leufu Pilmaiquén Maihue and Koyam Ke Che communities for the lack of prior consultation regarding the permits to be granted by the National Monuments Council to intervene in the Mapuche archaeological sites identified during the construction of the Los Lagos hydroelectric power plant. This filing was accepted by the Supreme Court on November 19, 2021 (Comunidad Indígena Leufu Pilmaiquén Maihue/Dirección de Bibliotecas Archivos y Museos 2021).

Abstract The prevalence of cascading failures is growing as infrastructure becomes more interdependent and climate change exacerbates more extreme hazards. After such events, the general focus is on the magnitude of direct damage or loss; it is less understood how events trigger failures throughout other infrastructure. In this work, we present a methodology to model direct and indirect impacts from an event for a multi-system network, including interconnected infrastructure and end users. We perform a case study of New Zealand’s second largest city, Christchurch, investigating electricity, water supply, and wastewater networks following a range of coastal flooding events and climate change scenarios. For a 10-year average recurrence interval event given no sea-level rise, there is a 216% increase from directly impacted end users to the total number of end users that have lost at least one utility. For the same scenario, this metric is 71%, 129%, and 131% for end users who have lost electricity, water, and wastewater, respectively. The results show a larger estimate of impact on residents and a more geospatially-varied loss of service. This methodology provides insight for utility operators, emergency response, and communities on node criticality, areas of impact, and resource requirements after an event occurs. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Cascading failuresInterdependent infrastructureRisk analysisCritical infrastructureUrban infrastructureResilienceNetwork modeling 1. Introduction The critical infrastructure we rely upon daily to provide services such as electricity, water, and sewage disposal is largely dependent on each other [1]. For example, the pumps throughout the water supply network rely on electricity to function, and wastewater treatment plants require electricity to treat incoming sewage. Similarly, water is used for cooling in electricity generation, and a physical disruption in the water or wastewater networks could impact nearby electrical substations. Because of this interdependence (and dependence) between systems, there can be unforeseen impacts due to cascading failures, which occur when one system failure causes another system to fail. While redundancies can be incorporated into networks (such as backup generators), the increasing variability and intensity of natural hazards expected to occur as a result of climate change means we need to consider future scenarios and how cascading failures may be triggered [2]. Examples of such events include the power outages in Texas due to the recent 2021 winter storm [3], in Puerto Rico due to Hurricane Maria in 2017 [4], in the 2005 Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans [5], along the U.S. East Coast in 2012 from Hurricane Sandy [6], and in Christchurch following the 2011 earthquakes [7]. These are disruptive and costly events that call for proactive measures to develop resilient infrastructure, which are often more cost-effective in the long term. In one study looking at infrastructure in thousands of different climate scenarios for low- and middle-income countries, a $1 investment in more resilient infrastructure had a benefit of $4, with an overall net benefit of $4.2 trillion across these countries [8]. Understanding cascading impacts can help decision-makers and utility operators develop more robust infrastructure and limit damage and costs when recovering from natural hazards. These interdependencies present a challenge for assessing and modeling risk in these systems. One framework to understand the interactions categorizes interdependence into physical, cyber, geographic, and logical interdependencies [1]. A review performed by Ouyang [9], further classified modeling approaches into six categories: empirical, agent-based, system dynamics-based, economic theory-based, network-based, and others. More recently, He and Cha [10] performed an extensive review of recovery and resilience modeling of infrastructure systems under disruptive events, reiterating most of the categorizations defined by Ouyang [9]: agent-based, system dynamics-based, input–output-based, computable general equilibrium-based, network topology-based, and network flow-based approaches. He and Cha [11] also differentiated the resolution of infrastructure modeling into system-to-system level, facility-to-facility level, and system-to-facility level, where the system could mean an entire power or water system while the facility could be the specific nodes within the system such as the pumping stations and electrical substations. Each of these methodologies have their trade-offs and advantages depending on the conditions such as the particular infrastructure, data, and complexity. Existing studies that demonstrate these methodologies and investigate hazard-related risks to infrastructure often focus on a single infrastructure system (e.g., [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19]) or present a regional [7], [11], [20], [21] or national [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], aggregated view on cascading failures. Regional and national studies assess large-scale trends or identify nationally critical nodes, while those that look at the city-scale use a similarly large data resolution or an idealized network. However, these studies have not sufficiently examined the intricacies of real-world and multiple networks or the local-level impacts on residents from cascading failures, which could highlight inequities in the community [27]. For example, Guidotti et al. [28] investigated an idealized interdependent network, which proposed a modeling framework that includes the recovery to get the infrastructure back online (also considered in [29] from a risk theory perspective, Sun and Zhang [30] for a transportation infrastructure, and González et al. [31] to power, water, and gas in Shelby County, TN, USA), but this example, which uses an idealized network, does not convey the geospatial impacts of the cascading failures on a real-world urban case study. Among the current body of work, the models largely incorporate business-as-usual hazards, such as earthquakes, previous hurricanes, and recurring flood events, which do not address divergent, uncertain scenarios such as events influenced by climate change [32] and need to be included in modeling to support the decision-making related to these impacts [33]. This uncertain future presented by climate change is among one of many uncertainties that are often neglected in models of interdependent infrastructure [34]. Additionally, there is a lack of metrics that address the impacts at the business and residential level [35], rather focusing on the system- or infrastructure-level resilience [19], [36], [37], [38] in terms of reduction of consequence [39] and functionality loss [30]. Common metrics include lost load, in which an assumption is made about utility use across the users, and economic impact, which places a certain valuation on functionality and may lead to underestimation of the impacts to different demographics. Wang et al. [40] describes a framework to understand interdependent infrastructure, applying a network model to the power and water systems of a city in China. This study uses network statistics to compare the impacts from a regional level, assessing the functionality of the infrastructure networks as opposed to the local impacts to the residents. Other studies similarly use recovery times and network statistics to assess the resilience or impacts to infrastructure [13], [41], [42], [43], which conveys the risk to the infrastructure, but stops short of understanding the residential impacts, in magnitude and geospatial location. In [44], the authors use social vulnerability indicators to look at cascading impacts from both random failures and Hurricane Irma on Tampa, Florida, however this is only for the community level and two interconnected systems (the water and transportation networks). While many of these studies work towards developing new methodologies to model interdependent infrastructure, few test the application in real-world case studies, which are important for understanding risk and how it plays out in interdependent infrastructure systems. The need to assess the performance of these theoretical models under different hazards and real-world conditions is highlighted both in model development studies and comprehensive reviews of modeling approaches [9], [10], [36]. Additionally, many authors apply their models to idealized and business-as-usual scenarios (for both the network and the hazard) which may perform differently than when applied to real networks with divergent hazards, and limit their applications to one or two networks. Few of these studies, even those at the facilities level, include granularity on the scale of residential properties, which can more accurately show the social cascading impacts. Our work addresses these gaps by applying an updated network model to the real-world infrastructure of Ōtautahi/Christchurch in New Zealand experiencing the hazard of coastal flooding under climate change and shows the cascading impacts from the infrastructure level down to the household level. Specifically, we examine the electricity, water supply, and wastewater networks within the city using real-world data, and investigate how impacts across all three systems translate to the end users throughout the community and the utilities, across a range of climate change scenarios. Therefore, we provide a quantitative assessment of direct and indirect risk and a qualitative discussion of the relative importance of its inclusion in a holistic risk assessment. We answer two important questions: (1) to what extent do indirect impacts change the assessment of risk to residents? and (2) how are impacts spatially distributed throughout the community? The next section describes the network model that was developed and run, the case study location and hazard selected for this simulation, and the specific data used for this analysis. Section 3 describes the geospatial and numerical results of the model, which are further explained in Section 4. 2. Methodology To begin, we developed a generalizable model of the integrated infrastructure networks and the communities they serve. Within the model, we simulate an event which directly impacts a subset of the utilities and users. Then, the properties dependent on the directly impacted assets are determined, after which the model quantitatively assesses both the direct and indirect risks from the event. Our model can be used on any city and incorporate any number of infrastructure networks as well as events (e.g. natural hazards, system failures, and malicious activity). The following subsections detail how this is conducted and introduces an application on an urban case study. 2.1. Model preparation First, geospatial data for each selected infrastructure system (e.g., water services, telecommunications, and electricity, which we call utilities) and the associated end users or properties (e.g., households, supermarkets, and businesses) for the study area are collected as inputs to the model. All together, this collection of data sets represents the system in study. At this stage, connections between the infrastructure and end users have not yet been established, but a baseline scenario of the system’s functionality can be determined. The other primary set of input data is the extent of the event, which is also included in the model as a geospatial data set. This could be a numeric value representing a hazard intensity, such as water depth or wind speed, or a Boolean indication of whether the area is exposed or not to the hazard. For this description, the event represents a single possible scenario, while in the case study, we iterate a series of scenarios through the model to create a portfolio of results. Next, the impact of the event is superimposed on the system, and the system elements (here the term elements or nodes includes both utility infrastructure and end users) are designated as either functional or out of service after the event. The functionality of the system elements after being exposed by the hazard are based on fragility curves, which define a functionality after a particular amount of exposure (e.g., water depth for flooding or peak ground acceleration for earthquakes). The specific components of the assets are not considered (e.g., the transformers or the pump housing), but rather the entire asset themselves (e.g., the substation building, the pumping station building, the residential house, etc.). For this study, we look at the worst-case scenario of exposure and simply use a single step fragility curve function, where any exposure means the particular element has failed. With imminent coastal flooding, these systems would be expected to be turned off before they are exposed or at the moment they become exposed, and households will be evacuated if any flooding has occurred. Therefore, while it is possible to incorporate partial functionality, this is not entirely insightful for this case study. The vulnerability of the links are not considered in this study, primarily for the reason that for coastal flooding, the overhead power lines and the underground pipelines are not often the critical points of failure. This model uses a network topology-based approach, and thus does not consider the specific flows throughout the systems, such as potential overloads on the electrical power or water networks. This set of results represents the direct impacts, which can be mapped to show the immediate loss of service from the event.

Network analysis To capture the indirect impacts, we leverage a network representation of our interdependent system. Each of the system elements are represented by a vertex, or node, in our network model, which can be connected to other infrastructures or end users via an edge, or link. Depending on the situation, the edges between the vertices may follow specific rules as to which vertices they are connecting (e.g., connecting an electric zone substation to a particular grid exit point), while for others, the edges may be generated based on proximity (e.g., connecting a household to the nearest wastewater treatment plant). The whole system (i.e., infrastructure vertices, end user vertices, and edges between these vertices) can be represented by an adjacency matrix, with the size of the matrix being proportional to the total number of vertices. Within the adjacency matrix, the edges between vertices are represented by a Boolean value (with 1 indicating a connection and 0 indicating no connection) [45]. More information on the network representation can be found in Appendix B. With the network representation of the system, the initial loss in service from the event is cascaded through the matrix to simulate the indirect loss of service. This is done by identifying the directly impacted vertices from the superimposed event on the system, as described in the previous section, and setting any connected vertices’ value to 0 in the adjacency matrix, signifying a loss in connection. This step of identifying connected vertices and setting the dependent vertices’ matrix values to 0 is repeated with the disconnected vertices to capture the successive indirect impacts until there are no more dependencies. The vertices that have lost connection are recorded, so that indirect impacts can be mapped. Another metric that has been integrated into the model is a calculation for end degree, which is a modified calculation of vertex degree. Here, we designate end degree as the total number of end users connected to a particular vertex in the network. This is a helpful metric to identify critical nodes from an end-user perspective. We calculate end degree for both the fully functional system and the impacted system (including both direct and indirect impacts). With this, we can understand the overall loss in connection throughout the system from an event. Further, we can provide insight to the utilities both in terms of which nodes lose the most service and which still have connections following an event. This process, shown in Fig. 1, provides an approach to determine the indirect impacts that result from an event, including impacts on the infrastructure, the end users, and the system as a whole. The next section details the use of the model on a real-world network. 2.3. Case study In this case study, the effects of a range of potential coastal flooding events on three interconnected systems in Christchurch, New Zealand are investigated: the electric power network, the water supply network, and the wastewater network. 2.3.1. Background Ōtautahi/Christchurch, the second largest city by urban population in Aotearoa New Zealand, is a low-lying, coastal city on the eastern coast of New Zealand’s South Island (Fig. 2). There are roughly 392,000 inhabitants within an area of approximately 295 square kilometers, resulting in a population density of about 1300 people per square kilometer. The city has two rivers flowing through it, the Avon River through the city center and the Heathcote River on the south side, which flow into an estuary and make certain areas more prone to flooding from both fluvial and coastal events. Christchurch experienced severe disruptions from earthquakes in 2010 and 2011, due to ground motion as well as liquefaction [46], and wildfires in the Port Hills surrounding the city in 2017 [47], and it is threatened by coastal hazards (such as coastal flooding, coastal erosion, and rising groundwater), tsunamis, and landslides [48], which may become more common as the climate becomes warmer [49], [50]. As such, it is a relevant case study for our model. Download : Download high-res image (716KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Map of Ōtautahi/Christchurch in New Zealand, highlighting the downtown area and larger infrastructure nodes. 2.3.2. Coastal flooding We focus this case study on coastal flooding, which is a relevant hazard for many communities along shorelines that will only intensify with climate change [51]. These events are often described in terms of their average recurrence interval [ARI], which is an indication of how many years are expected on average to be between events. For example, a 100-year ARI for a coastal flooding event would reflect the extent and severity of the flooding that would be expected about once every 100 years. This hazard is exacerbated by sea level rise [SLR], which can make the flooding event more frequent and/or more severe. The data in this study for coastal flooding is based on storm-tide-driven extreme sea levels [ESL]. ESLs occur from a combination of mean sea level [MSL], storm tide (which incorporates high tide, meteorological effects, and monthly sea level anomaly), the wave setup at the shoreline, and SLR. In this study, we used ESL inundation maps from [52] for nine ARIs (2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1000 years) and 0.1 m SLR increments up to 3 meters above present-day MSL. The maps were created using a static “bathtub” model and local LiDAR digital elevation models [DEMs] to map the extent and depths for inundation areas hydraulically connected to coastlines. These models have been developed for the entirety of New Zealand’s coastal urban areas, which includes Christchurch, at a resolution of 2 m. Further information on the methodology behind developing the coastal flooding maps can be found in [52]. 2.3.3. Data The infrastructure data used in this case study includes the electric power network [EPN], water supply network [WSN], and wastewater network [WWN] for Christchurch. The EPN contains transmission grid exit points, zone substations, network substations, and distribution substations. The WSN is made up of potable water supply/storage reservoirs and pump houses. The WWN has one wastewater treatment plant and pump houses (separate from the WSN). The three networks have dependencies on themselves, as well as on each other, notably on the EPN since certain nodes in the water and wastewater networks rely on the electricity grid for power. The end user nodes are determined via proxy, based off of the water meters throughout the city. These include residential, commercial, and industrial users. Within the model, we assume each of these have an independent dependency on the three utilities, meaning that one utility failing does not necessarily mean that the other utilities have failed. The connections among the utilities and end user nodes were primarily automated based on closest proximity by road network distance, since most urban utility infrastructure is underneath or alongside roads. A few of the connections were updated following engagement with the utility providers. The specific dependencies between the various system components is depicted in Fig. 3. Using these inputs as the system, the model was run for several coastal flooding hazard scenarios, varying both ARI and SLR. A hazard-specific parameter that can be varied in the model is the flooding depth at which an element is considered exposed (and thus nonfunctional). These depth thresholds can be different for each of the infrastructure networks as well as for the end users, but for this case study, it is assumed that if a node has any depth of flooding, it is at risk of failing. In practice, this could result from an operator safely shutting it off or from loss of service due to water exposure. The thresholds can be adjusted in order to capture the vulnerability, as opposed to exposure, of the utilities or households, informed by either fragility curves or by the service provider’s own experience and knowledge about their assets.

Results To understand interdependence, the first step is to understand how many users depend on each of the assets under investigation. We show this in Fig. 4, which displays the infrastructure’s end degree for the initial, fully functional EPN, WSN, and WWN networks. To reiterate, this degree value represents the number of end users that are connected to that node, where red colors indicate a greater number of dependent end users than green colors. The infrastructure is spatially dispersed regarding end degree, yet some infrastructure nodes appear to be susceptible to even a mild coastal flooding event (i.e., ARI of 10 years and no SLR), shown in Fig. 5. We show the direct impacts from a coastal flooding event (with an ARI of 10 years and no SLR) on our three infrastructure networks in Fig. 5, highlighting nodes that are exposed to flooding, with the red nodes indicating greater inundation depth from this event. For this scenario, 142 EPN nodes, 12 WSN nodes, and 32 WWN nodes were directly exposed, out of 4360, 216, and 418 total nodes, respectively. As for the direct exposure on the end user nodes, 3639 out of 133,342 end users were exposed to the flooding, as shown in Fig. 6(a).

The amount of end users without service for each combination of loss in utility is presented in Table 1, with the number of end users without at least one utility constituting roughly 9% of the total end users.

(b) End users without service after a coastal flooding event with an ARI of 10 years and no SLR. For this case study, a sensitivity to different SLR scenarios (from 0 cm of SLR to 300 cm of SLR by 10-cm increments) as well as different ARIs (2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1000 years), both of which impact the severity of the coastal flooding event, was performed. The total number of end users directly impacted, indirectly impacted, and impacted overall was calculated for each of these variations. Fig. 7 shows impacts on end users for each infrastructure system in the 10-year ARI scenario as SLR increases. As there is a rise in sea level, the direct and indirect impacts follow different patterns due to the system’s composition, which will be explained later. When comparing the directly impacted properties to the total (directly and indirectly) impacted properties for the 10-year ARI and no SLR scenario, we see an increase of 71% for the electricity network, 129% for the water network, and 131% for the wastewater network (Fig. 7). These percentages are fairly constant as SLR increases, until the threshold at which the indirect values start to decrease and number of exposed properties overtakes the indirectly impacted properties. For the same 10-year ARI and 0 cm SLR scenario, there is a 216% increase between the directly impacted properties and the number of properties who lose at least one utility. Table 1.

Discussion In our paper, we seek to answer (1) does considering indirect impacts substantially change the assessment of residents impacted? and (2) how are impacts spatially distributed throughout the community? We have shown that in Christchurch, assessments that do not include the indirect impacts of coastal flooding are not only underestimating the total impact from the event, but also missing the spatial distribution of impacts from the event, both often at the expense of understanding the community-level effects. Risk assessments that are prepared before an event occurs will often try to capture the extent of loss of service either by (a) modeling the direct exposure of the infrastructure components or by (b) using historical statistics about loss of service. However, both of these approaches fall short of capturing the extent of impact from an event. The former is often done from the perspective of the utility (i.e., since the model is based around the infrastructure nodes), so does not accurately reflect the scope of the impact on the community, while the latter does not discern between the changes or updates in the system’s design. An infrastructure exposure assessment relies heavily on the knowledge each of the various utilities have available to them during and after an event. Electricity providers are often capable of having near-real-time data about the service they provide to users, while for water or wastewater networks, their service knowledge may stop at the extent of their own infrastructure nodes (e.g., pump houses or reservoirs) unless the utility providers have invested in a monitoring/sensor network. Using traditional statistical modeling may be useful for predicting particular event impacts, yet often struggles to incorporate the uncertainty that may occur over time (for both the disruption scenario and for the system), falling outside of the training data set. This is particularly relevant for impacts from climate change, as we can expect both disruptive scenarios we have not yet experienced and future development in urban environments. Our work addresses the above shortcomings by assessing outages throughout the infrastructure systems and the community in a real-world case study. When considering the end users without service after a coastal flooding event with an ARI of 10 years and no SLR, about 9% of total end users have lost at least one utility and 3.5% of total end users have lost all three utilities. Of those who have lost at least one utility, only about a third were actually exposed to flooding, meaning two thirds of the end users were impacted due to an indirect impact. This difference is obvious when comparing the map of the exposed end users (Fig. 6(a)), where the impacted nodes are clustered within a tight vicinity of the rivers, with the impacted end users (Fig. 6(b)), where additional groups of properties appear as a result of the upstream outages. In addition to serving as a quick visualization for the number and spatial distribution of affected end users, the results presented in Fig. 6(b) also reveal a more detailed assessment of which utilities have lost service. This is useful for emergency response situations, where extra supplies (e.g., clean water, portable toilets, backup generators, etc.) can be strategically deployed to at-risk areas and to provide an estimate as to how many end users might need emergency housing or accommodation. These spatial results can be further interpreted by looking at the plots of exposed properties, indirectly impacted properties, and properties with a total loss of service in Fig. 7, Fig. 9. The lines representing total impacts show that as SLR increases, the magnitude of impacts increases sporadically. Breaking this down into direct and indirect impacts for this system, the exposed end users steadily increase, while the indirect impacts on end users drives the variation in total impacts. The impacts of increasing SLR for properties experiencing at least one outage (Fig. 9) have a similar trend as outages per utility (Fig. 7), but have higher values of impacted end users for both indirect and total outages due to the variation in spatial distribution of each of the utility outages, which do not always overlap. The reason for the main direct and indirect trends is that direct flooding consistently impacts more properties as SLR increases, while large sections of the community are indirectly impacted all at once when an infrastructure node becomes exposed. Generally, indirect impacts increase as sea-level rise increases until a threshold, when the exposure from the event overtakes the indirectly impacted properties. Hence the peaks in indirect impacts in Fig. 7, Fig. 9. The sharp increases in the indirect impacts line (also reflected in the total impacts line), reflect the non-linear nature of cascading failures. In particular, these indicate that there are subtle tipping points, or thresholds, inherent in our interconnected urban infrastructure that contribute to cascading failures. When these thresholds are surpassed, the impacts extend to a group of nodes (be it infrastructure or end users), causing the number impacted to jump. These tipping points are subtle in that they are not immediately obvious when looking at our systems, yet have far-reaching second and third degree impacts. This can similarly be seen in Fig. 8, which compares the difference in service of the 0 cm SLR scenario with the 30 cm SLR scenario for a coastal flooding event with an ARI of 10 years. The cascading failure phenomena is captured by the groupings of red nodes in the maps that are not overlying any coastal flooding (indicated in blue) for the 30 cm SLR scenario. The inclusion of cascading failures in our risk analyses can help us better understand the structure of our interconnected systems, as well as the impacts on our communities. This updated approach to impact assessments has implications for the utility operators, showing them where there are vulnerabilities in the system, as well as providing insight as to where to improve robustness in their infrastructure. For the residents, these findings can help enhance community preparedness, by advising high risk neighborhoods of possible outages as well as knowing which provisions might be needed. Similarly, our results can guide emergency response teams by indicating which areas are likely to be impacted, informing them what might be needed in those areas, and by giving them an estimate of the amount of supplies and emergency accommodation needed. 5. Conclusion Our infrastructure is becoming more complex as it becomes more interconnected, resulting in more complex disruptions after an event occurs. The cascading failures that originate from these interdependencies are similarly intricate and difficult to model across networks. In this paper, we argue that these indirect impacts, such as cascading failures, should be incorporated in network-wide risk analyses, and provide a model to address this. We describe a methodology to assess direct and indirect impacts on a set of interconnected networks and end users and then apply this to the case study of Christchurch, New Zealand. The results from this application show that depending on the system, the indirect impacts of an event may contribute to the majority of the loss in service when compared to the direct impacts from the event. Risk assessments that neglect to include these indirect impacts are thus vastly underestimating the impact from an event. Another finding is that the outages of the various networks are not evenly spatially distributed throughout the community, meaning that different response and recovery measures may be needed. Such a city-wide assessment of the impacts to its interdependent infrastructure has not yet been performed, but we argue this is a key step in understanding a system’s risk, particularly when faced with uncertain future scenarios such as climate change. Further application of this model could include developing a suite of hazards to get a more complete picture of the risks threatening a community. With the addition of other hazards, the links between the nodes (e.g., pipelines and power lines) may play a more critical role and thus would be needed to be modeled. Two other directions for further investigation would be to include more detailed fragility curves to better understand the vulnerability of various assets as well as to incorporate the partial failure of nodes due to the loss of some network components (e.g., overload of the power grid or insufficient pressures in the water network). These applications all require more detailed data, and thus the feasibility of general application to other case studies is variable. Nonetheless, this study demonstrates how a simple data set could be used to understand the cascading failures of an urban system. Despite the intricacy involved with cascading failures, they can provide critical insight into our systems and communities, both in their design and their vulnerabilities. Better understanding these impacts can help make more robust and resilient urban communities, and can play a larger role in the assessment and response of disruptions to our infrastructure.

Network analysis The basis for modeling networks is through an adjacency matrix, which are a mathematically convenient way to represent directed and undirected graphs. Since the dependency in our networks is one-directional (e.g. electricity is flowing from the grid to the households, and water is flowing from the water supply to the households) and there are no closed cycles within the network, our system is represented by a directed acyclic graph Fig. 10. The vertices, or nodes, in the graph are the row index and column index (i.e. node 1 is represented by the first row and the first column), while edges, also called arcs or links (which indicate dependence), are represented by a 1 in the adjacency matrix Fig. 11. For each row, which represents a node, a dependent connection on another node is shown by placing a 1 in the column which that node is dependent on. For example, if node 4 is dependent on both node 1 and node 2, then there will be a 1 located in the adjacency matrix at row 4, column 1 as well as at row 4, column 2. Considering the matrix as a whole, rows indicate any dependence that node has on other nodes, while columns indicate any dependents that node has on it.

For directed acyclic graphs, only the bottom left half of the matrix could contain 1’s, while for undirected graphs and generic directed graphs, both the bottom left and the top right half could contain 1’s. A single adjacency matrix can represent multiple networks by simply adding additional rows and columns for the number of nodes in the other networks. Once the matrix is set up, calculations can be run to acquire the end degree, or how many dependents a particular node has, in order to assess the initial state of the system. To simulate a loss in connection, the values in the column of the node’s index can be changed to a 0, recording the row number of those values that were turned from a 1 to a 0. Subsequently, the row number of the values changed to zero in the previous step can be used to change the dependent connections to 0, by changing the values in that column number to 0. This is repeated until there are no more dependents, recording those that have lost service in each step. Calculations can again be run to see how many connections have been lost due to the particular event, again through using the end degree for this finalized, updated adjacency matrix.

Abstract The increasing demand for water and worsening climate change place significant pressure on this vital resource, making its preservation a global priority. Water quality monitoring programs are essential for effectively managing this resource. Current programs rely on traditional monitoring approaches, leading to limitations such as low spatiotemporal resolution and high operational costs. Despite the adoption of novel monitoring approaches that enable better data resolution, the public's comprehension of water quality matters remains low, primarily due to communication process deficiencies. This study explores the advantages and challenges of using Internet of Things (IoT) and citizen science as alternative monitoring approaches, emphasizing the need for enhancing public communication of water quality data. Through a systematic review of studies implemented on-field, we identify and propose strategies to address five key challenges that IoT and citizen science monitoring approaches must overcome to mature into robust sources of water quality information. Additionally, we highlight three fundamental problems affecting the water quality communication process and outline strategies to convey this topic effectively to the public.

Introduction Water, an essential resource for human life, faces a continuously increasing demand due to population growth and economic development (Ma et al., 2020). Estimates indicate that the worldwide population suffering from urban water scarcity can grow from 933 million in 2016 to 2.373 billion by 2050 (He et al., 2021). Nevertheless, water demand is one of many threats to its availability, as low quality also renders water unsuitable for multiple purposes (Vliet et al., 2021). Thus, quantity and quality must be preserved to prevent water scarcity. International legislation, such as the European Union Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC), has been developed to maintain and improve the status of the aquatic environment and encourage sustainable water use. Furthermore, globally, the sixth Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of the United Nations (2022) aims to guarantee water and sanitation availability and sustainable management. Water resources management requires implementing water quality monitoring programs (WQMPs) to evaluate the status of water bodies (Kirschke et al., 2020). A reliable assessment of water quality and quantity allows decision-makers to evaluate the effectiveness of their management practices and government programs employed to preserve or improve the ecological status of a water source (Behmel et al., 2016). Therefore, WQMPs should be comprehensively designed, covering all aspects from the initial determination of monitoring objectives and the monitoring network design to evaluating if the information gathered is being communicated effectively with stakeholders and if it is helpful for decision-making (da Luz et al., 2022; see Fig. 1).

Design elements of a water quality monitoring program (1) Establishment of the monitoring objectives (e.g., public health protection, ecosystem health assessment, evaluation of ecological restoration projects); (2) selection of sampling sites to be included in the monitoring network; (3) selection of water quality parameters; (4) definition of sampling frequencies; (5) estimation of the required resources; (6) logistics planning: fieldwork, laboratory analysis, data handling, storage, analysis, and validation; (7) identification of communication channels; and (8) evaluation of information use. Developed based on Behmel et al. (2016). One aspect of WQMPs under constant evolution is the methods employed to evaluate water quality. Traditional monitoring approaches were designed to monitor well-established parameters (e.g., total nitrogen, total phosphorus, fecal coliforms) in specialized facilities, requiring trained personnel to handle sample collection and processing (Ahmed et al., 2019). The former results in high costs and reduced sampling frequencies, especially in low- and middle-income countries with limited financial resources. Novel technological and scientific advancements allow water quality to be monitored using alternative approaches that offer distinct advantages over traditional methods. For instance, non-target screening and effect-directed tools can be incorporated into WQMPs to assess emerging pollutants such as pharmaceuticals, hormones, or personal care products and their effects (Brack et al., 2019). Furthermore, automated monitoring and remote sensing allow the assessment of water quality using sensors, eliminating the need to deploy field personnel for sample collection. Over the past few decades, automated water quality monitoring (WQM) has undergone a significant transformation from the initial use of in situ sensors towards the adoption of wireless sensor network technologies (WSN), culminating in the integration of Internet of Things (IoT) solutions (Adu-Manu et al., 2017). Although in situ sensors allow real-time determination of water quality parameters, these devices do not permit continuous monitoring and require staff deployment. These limitations have led to the development of WSN technologies, allowing continuous retrieval of water quality data at nearly real-time speeds without human intervention (Martínez et al., 2020). Still, WSN technologies face high energy demands, device communication issues, low computational performance, reduced data storage, and high maintenance costs, leading to a shift towards IoT technologies (Olatinwo and Joubert, 2019). IoT enables the interconnection of objects, such as electronic devices and sensors, through the Internet (Kumar et al., 2019). This capability allows IoT devices to use the existing communication infrastructure and cloud computing to overcome WSN limitations and provide stakeholders with timely information. Additionally, IoT devices can incorporate software sensors for predicting water quality parameters based on the information from physical sensors, reducing monitoring costs (Pattnaik et al., 2021). In recent years, citizen science has also gained importance as an alternative method for collecting water quality information, involving the active participation of the public in monitoring activities, scientific research, and knowledge generation (Jollymore et al., 2017). Citizen science can potentially enhance data collection, observation, and dissemination (Mdee et al., 2022). Citizen-based WQM initiatives can provide reliable information on water bodies of diverse types and sizes, increasing the spatiotemporal resolution and complementing the data produced by scientists and government institutions at reduced costs (Hadj-Hammou et al., 2017; Quinlivan et al., 2020). Additionally, these initiatives can improve the public's understanding of water quality and enhance current communication practices by increasing social involvement and awareness of water issues (Metcalfe et al., 2022). Due to their characteristics, IoT and citizen science have received interest as potential tools that can contribute to achieving different SDGs. IoT technologies can be applied to provide timely and accurate information about the quality of water resources, water usage, or wastewater management, which can contribute directly to SDG 6 and also towards SDG 11 by supporting the development of sustainable cities and communities (López-Vargas et al., 2020; Alzahrani et al., 2023). Citizen science initiatives focusing on water quality monitoring can potentially contribute towards SDG 6 by complementing the data of existing WQMPs (Fraisl et al., 2020). Furthermore, some citizen science projects involve collaboration among communities, scientists, and policymakers, aligning with SDG 17. Contrary to the high interest in previous monitoring approaches, scientists and practitioners have often overlooked the efficient communication of the information produced by WQMPs. While there have been significant advances in mass media in recent decades, there is little knowledge of the public's communication needs regarding water quality, leading to water quality information often being delivered using communication channels that are not preferred by the public (Behmel et al., 2018). Information may be presented via television news when the target public expects the information to be delivered using interactive maps. Sometimes, WQM results are presented using complex language that hinders the public's understanding (Brouwer et al., 2020). Hence, there is a need to evaluate the local context to identify the most appropriate communication channels and ways to present information to the public. Despite their potential benefits, IoT and citizen-based monitoring approaches have yet to be integrated into WQMPs due to inherent limitations that need to be addressed. Furthermore, unless there are substantial enhancements in water quality communication, implementing these monitoring approaches will merely improve the level of information without contributing to the public's understanding of water quality. This systematic review aims to (1) identify the advantages and challenges associated with the use of IoT and citizen science as alternative WQM approaches, (2) provide insights on how to address the identified challenges for each monitoring approach, and (3) identify the issues hindering effective water quality communication and propose solutions to communicate water quality results to the public effectively. By identifying and proposing solutions to recurring challenges in IoT and citizen science field studies, we intend to inform future project designs so that these issues can be proactively addressed from the outset. Moreover, we seek to raise awareness about the inadequacies of current water quality communication practices, advocating for incorporating effective communication strategies into future WQM projects and encouraging much-needed research in this area. 2. Systematic review methodology The systematic review was conducted following the procedure described in Fig. 2. The Scopus and Web of Science databases were used to identify studies from the last ten years that covered citizen and IoT-based WQM approaches as well as water quality communication. The search query used to identify keywords in the article title, abstract, and keywords sections was: (((automated OR IoT OR \"Internet of Things\") AND \"water quality monitoring\") OR \"water quality communication\" OR (\"water quality\" AND \"citizen science\") OR \"water quality reports\" OR \"water quality platform\" OR \"water quality decision support system\") AND PUBYEAR >2012.

IoT: Internet of Things, WQM: Water Quality Monitoring. *Keywords: “automated”, “IoT”, \"Internet of Things\", \"water quality monitoring\", \"water quality communication\", \"water quality\", \"citizen science\", \"water quality reports\", \"water quality platform\", \"water quality decision support system\". The selection criteria were peer-reviewed research articles in English that focused on citizen science applied to WQM, IoT-based WQM, or water quality communication (WQC). The included studies for citizen science and IoT-based WQM were centered exclusively on surface water. However, in the context of WQC, the scope was extended to encompass investigations into drinking water due to the scarcity of available information. The excluded articles were those that (1) focused on remote sensing, groundwater, use of uncrewed vehicles, water restoration activities, or WQM in aquaculture, agriculture, water treatment plants, or water tanks; (2) studies that involved the monitoring or the communication of a single water quality parameter; (3) reviews, letters, perspectives, conference papers, book chapters, and books; and (4) studies that were not implemented. The studies that were considered as implemented were those performed in the field, outside laboratory-controlled conditions. In the case of IoT-based WQM, this resulted in the exclusion of articles that focused solely on the design of an IoT device or its associated algorithms without performing measurements directly in a water body. For citizen science, we excluded studies focused on the theoretical design of the project without performing its execution. Lastly, we excluded WQC studies that did not analyze the understanding of water quality or develop tools to enhance public communication. After obtaining the results from the search query, titles were screened to remove duplicates. A second screening that considered the title and abstract was then performed to remove the records that were out of the scope of this review. After the screening, studies were classified according to the publication type, and only research articles were included. The full text for the articles was then reviewed to assess their eligibility based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria described above. Subsequently, the remaining articles were included for analysis and classified into four categories: IoT-based WQM, citizen science, WQC, and mixed scope. 3. Results The initial search strategy resulted in 1200 articles, with 773 and 427 records identified from Scopus and Web of Science, respectively. Upon the initial screening of publication titles, 415 duplicates were identified and removed. Further screening of the title and abstract resulted in the exclusion of 587 records that were out of the scope of this study. Classification by type of study resulted in the exclusion of 104 records. Of the remaining 94 articles, 50 met the eligibility criteria and were considered for full-text analysis. The included articles focus on citizen science (n = 25), IoT-based WQM (n = 14), and WQC (n = 9). Only two articles were identified to cover more than one of the previous scopes (with a mixed scope) and were analyzed within more than one category. The succeeding subsections provide an overview of the examined IoT, citizen science, and WQC studies, summarizing relevant aspects for each monitoring approach and the findings for communication studies. Detailed tables are provided for the reader to (1) assess the diversity and potential of IoT and citizen science WQM projects implemented on-field and (2) identify relevant research on WQC. Later, in the discussion section, we recover the main challenges identified in the reviewed studies and provide suggestions for managing these issues and enhancing the communication of water quality to the public. Lastly, we provide future perspectives and conclusions on the reviewed areas. 3.1. IoT-based water quality monitoring A total of 15 references (IoT n = 14, mixed scope n = 1) were reviewed on relevant aspects such as measured water quality parameters using physical sensors, employed microcontroller, communication hardware used, cloud services utilization, the method employed by the user to access the data, software sensors integration, device power source, country of implementation, monitored water body type, and data validation. The findings are summarized in Table 1. Table 1. Summary of the reviewed Internet of Things-based water quality monitoring studies.

The range of measured water quality parameters varied from two to seventeen. Excluding the study that collected data for 17 parameters (Singh et al., 2022), the average number of measured parameters was 3.4 ± 1.1. Twelve studies measured four or fewer parameters to determine the water quality of a water body. The most frequently measured parameters were temperature, turbidity, and pH, determined in 11 studies, followed by dissolved oxygen and electrical conductivity, measured in seven and six studies, respectively. Only two studies implemented software sensors based on machine learning algorithms for predicting water quality parameters that cannot be directly measured using physical sensors. In only five studies, data was validated by comparing the results with those obtained following a traditional WQM approach. While the hardware setup varied among the monitoring devices, the preferred microcontroller board type was Arduino (n = 6), and the data communication was performed via a Wi-Fi module (n = 6). There was no clear trend regarding the preference for cloud service; however, most studies (n = 12) make data accessible online. Regarding power sources, solar panel–battery systems were employed in 47% (n = 7) of the devices, followed by using batteries alone in one-third (n = 5) of the monitoring systems. Monitoring devices were primarily employed to assess the water quality of rivers and lakes, respectively documented in seven and three references. Almost half of the reviewed studies (47%) were implemented in India (n = 4) and Malaysia (n = 3). The rest of the studies were implemented in China (n = 2), Italy (n = 2), Australia (n = 1), Brunei (n = 1), Hong Kong (n = 1), and the United Kingdom (n = 1). 3.2. Citizen science Twenty-seven articles (citizen science n = 25, mixed scope n = 2) focusing on citizen science WQM were analyzed on monitoring approach, measured water quality parameters, periodicity of monitoring, monitored water body type, information communication method, country of implementation, and main challenges. Additional aspects that were assessed included the methods for validating the data collected by the volunteers, the training of the project participants, the collaboration with government institutions, the understanding of water quality by the public, and whether water quality data was reported to be accurate (Table 2).

Ten studies employed more than one monitoring approach to determine the water quality of a water body; the three most frequent were chemical test kits (n = 16), followed by on-site probes (n = 7), and traditional techniques involving the use of laboratory equipment (n = 6). Only one study employed IoT devices (Diviacco et al., 2021) for citizen WQM (Fig. 3A). The five most frequently monitored parameters were nitrate (n = 15), phosphate (n = 14), pH (n = 13), turbidity (n = 12), and temperature (n = 9). The analyzed articles measured 4.3 ± 1.8 parameters on average, whereas ten studies measured more than four parameters to determine water quality. The range of measured parameters varied from two to nine. Download : Download high-res image (402KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. (A). Monitoring approach for assessing water quality parameters in the reviewed citizen science studies. (B). Communication approaches for sharing water quality results with the public in the reviewed citizen science projects. Abbreviations - IoT: Internet of Things, Micro: Microbiological, SBS: Smartphone-based sensors. More than half of the studies (n = 15) monitored water quality without a specific periodicity, although some followed a monthly (n = 6) or a weekly (n = 1) periodicity. Five studies monitored water quality on a single occasion. Nine studies monitored more than one water body, mostly rivers or streams (n = 16), followed by lakes (n = 12), ponds (n = 5), the sea (n = 2), and wetlands (n = 1). The preferred approach for communicating water quality results was the use of a web page or web platform (n = 21), and only four studies (∼15%) used more than one communication channel (Fig. 3B). The analyzed publications were conducted in 19 countries, with three studies considering more than one country. China, the United States, and Canada were the leading countries, with four citizen science projects implemented in each country. Although the authors from seven studies did not disclose the challenges associated with their citizen science project, 11 reported more than one problem. The primary reported challenges were measurement uncertainties associated with the monitoring methods (n = 7), issues related to citizen engagement (n = 7), sampling bias (e.g., lower sampling of non-urban areas or certain water bodies; n = 7), monitoring results not used by scientists or authorities (n = 3), and a low number of observations (n = 3). Data validation, either statistically or by comparing citizen-gathered results with professional measurements, was included in the design of 23 of the 27 citizen science projects. Similarly, 85% (n = 23) of the studies reported that volunteers were trained before monitoring water quality. Citizen-gathered data were described as accurate in most publications (n = 17), with five studies depicting it as inaccurate and five not providing an explicit statement on data quality. Government collaboration or funding was identified in 15 publications. Lastly, only one article evaluated communication aspects by testing whether the citizen science initiative improved the participants' understanding of water quality parameters (Araújo et al., 2022). 3.3. Water quality communication Ten studies that evaluated WQC were reviewed (WQC n = 9, mixed scope n = 1). Most references (70%) focused on the communication of drinking water quality. Marine and watershed communication was covered in two and one reference, respectively. Four studies assessed communication based on Customer Confidence Reports. Two publications focused on developing water quality indexes with visual cues that can be used to improve WQC. Lastly, public perception and expectations of WQC from a general perspective were evaluated in four references. The analyzed references mainly focused on WQC in North America (n = 8). A summary of the reviewed research is provided in Table 3. Table 3. Summary of the analyzed water quality communication studies.

IoT-based water quality monitoring Existing WQMPs often rely on traditional monitoring approaches involving manual sampling and laboratory analysis, which presents challenges in covering entire catchments. The former approach results in low sampling frequencies, which provide only a snapshot of the dynamic nature of water quality parameters, potentially overlooking critical events like flow or contaminant concentration spikes. Technological advances in sensors and communication technologies provide an opportunity to shift from the traditional WQM scheme towards automated approaches (Yanes et al., 2020). Automated monitoring allows the timely determination of water quality without deploying experienced field personnel to collect and transport samples for their analysis, facilitating high-resolution data collection (Meyer et al., 2019; Pasika and Gandla, 2020). Integrating cost-effective sensor technologies into WQMPs enables high-resolution spatiotemporal monitoring, paving the way for establishing causal relationships between drivers and response variables (Bieroza et al., 2023). This capability allows the detection of subtle changes in water quality conditions, which can be advantageous for identifying unregulated wastewater discharges into a water body (Solano et al., 2022). Using low-cost monitoring devices can make WQM more affordable, especially for countries with limited resources, opening the possibility of using the available budget to increase the sampling points and improve spatial coverage (Miller et al., 2023). This approach provides real-time insights into the entire river network, facilitating the identification of hotspot areas, which serve as critical starting points for implementing intervention measures to improve water quality (Lofton et al., 2023). Automated monitoring has recently focused on developing and implementing IoT-based WQM devices. As depicted in Fig. 4, the IoT scheme generally involves data being acquired, transmitted, processed, stored, and delivered (Y. Chen and Han, 2018). Data is acquired using sensors, generally located in situ, which measure water quality parameters and provide input to a controller (Geetha and Gouthami, 2017). The controller can then either directly send or process and send the data received from the sensor to an online web service using adequate communication technology. Cloud services can store and analyze data and apply machine learning algorithms to estimate water quality (Srivastava et al., 2018). Lastly, the analyzed data is delivered to local authorities or other users via readily available communication channels such as a web page, text messages, or mobile apps (Shafi et al., 2018).

Steps involved in an Internet of Things (IoT) water quality monitoring scheme. *Data can be directly sent or locally processed before being sent to cloud services. IoT provides multiple advantages besides delivering high temporal resolution data to end users at almost real-time speed. The costs of IoT-based monitoring are relatively low because it employs already existing communication infrastructure and cloud computing (Shi et al., 2019). The heavy computational loads can be managed through cloud services (e.g., ThingSpeak, ThingsBoard, or Amazon Web Services), requiring only a simple and low-cost processor on-field instead of an advanced computing device (Ray, 2016). Integration into the cloud also results in local devices being employed for performing simple tasks and remaining in a low power consumption mode. Additionally, it is possible to integrate machine learning algorithms into cloud servers to enhance the determination of water quality by predicting additional parameters or future trends based on the measurements of physical sensors (Alshehri et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2019). Another advantage of IoT monitoring devices is that they can be coupled with software sensors, which are virtual devices that employ mathematical models or machine learning to infer the values of water quality parameters without the need for physical sensors (Zainurin et al., 2022). The former enables the estimation of parameters that are not directly measurable due to the inexistence of dedicated sensors or their high cost. Multiple studies have discussed the development of software sensors for WQM based on the use of artificial neural networks (Foschi et al., 2021), random forests (Castrillo and García, 2020), multiple linear regression (Schilling et al., 2017), support vector machines (El Bilali et al., 2021), fuzzy logic systems (Zhou et al., 2022), and Bayesian networks ( Zhang et al., 2021). The systematic analysis revealed two studies incorporating software sensors into IoT devices for monitoring water bodies. Wang et al. (2021) employed an IoT device that gathered data from five physical sensors (total dissolved solids, temperature, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, and pH) to estimate five additional parameters (nitrate-nitrogen, phosphates, nitrite-nitrogen, 5-day biological oxygen demand (BOD5), and ammonia-nitrogen) using a general regression neural network and a multivariate polynomial regression model. The estimations were considered adequate, with determination coefficients higher than 0.78. Pattnaik et al. (2021) developed an IoT device with four physical sensors (dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature, and turbidity) capable of determining BOD5 using machine learning algorithms. The system was tested on-field employing a K nearest-neighbor approach for BOD5 prediction, achieving a 0.92 correlation coefficient. Relevant examples of employing IoT devices coupled with machine learning to assess water quality have also been documented in other contexts, including water purification plants (Bhardwaj et al., 2022), wastewater treatment facilities (Sundui et al., 2021), and aquaculture systems (Manoharan et al., 2020). A limitation regarding physical sensors is that long-term in situ deployment can cause fouling, a phenomenon characterized by the accumulation of undesirable particles or microorganisms within the sensor that can produce incorrect measurements (Murray et al., 2020). From the analyzed references, three research articles indicated fouling problems with sensors on the monitoring devices. Turbidity sensors presented this problem in all identified studies, resulting in readings drift (Chen and Han, 2018; Trevathan and Schmidtke, 2022; Wong et al., 2021). Regular cleaning and calibration of the sensors are recommended to ensure accurate readings, with the maintenance interval dependent on the local environmental conditions. Devices deployed in water bodies with high turbidity or high concentrations of microorganisms will require shorter maintenance intervals to prevent fouling (Wong et al., 2021). The suggested maintenance interval for the devices in the reviewed studies varied between one to six months. Predictive maintenance algorithms can be incorporated into IoT systems to indicate when maintenance will be required (Sami and Khan, 2023). However, shorter intervals will result in a higher device maintenance cost as personnel must be deployed to clean the sensors. Ideally, the systems should be developed so sensors and other mechanical parts can be automatically cleaned without human assistance (Singh et al., 2022). The calibration of physical sensors must also be considered to maintain accurate readings. Sensor calibration was reported in 12 of the 15 reviewed studies, indicating the relevance of this process for gathering accurate data. Calibration should be performed using certified reference materials at intervals dependent on the specific sensor and the environmental conditions (Singh et al., 2022). Although sensor calibration was reported as a widespread practice, measurement validation was only performed on five reviewed articles, despite this process being essential to assess the reliability of the data. Measurement validation should be performed by comparing the results from the IoT device with those obtained by following the standardized methodologies indicated in local legislation (Martínez et al., 2020). IoT-based WQM devices should be designed considering the place of implementation. Monitoring devices must be robust and reliable to withstand changing environmental conditions, as deployment and maintenance may be complex, especially at remote locations (Xu et al., 2019). In addition to the environment, birds and other wildlife can interact with the devices, causing damage; therefore, the design and manufacturing method plays a significant role (Trevathan and Schmidtke, 2022). Modular and reconfigurable hardware can prolong the lifespan of devices and diminish the expenses associated with replacing damaged or obsolete components (Rahmani et al., 2023). Energy efficiency is crucial for IoT devices, as replacing batteries requires deploying personnel, leading to increased costs. Therefore, employing energy-efficient components and software is essential for IoT systems, especially those solely reliant on battery power. Using low-power wide-area networks such as LoRa (Long Range Wide Area), Sigfox, or NB-IoT (Narrowband-IoT) will extend the interval for replacing batteries (Olatinwo and Joubert, 2019). Selecting an appropriate routing protocol is also relevant for optimizing energy efficiency in IoT devices, as these protocols determine the paths that data packets take through the network. Recent studies have focused on the development of energy-efficient protocols for IoT applications (Chithaluru et al., 2023; Narayan et al., 2023). Integrating energy harvesting technologies into IoT devices such as solar panels is recommended as they can continuously provide energy to the system, thereby increasing its independence capabilities (Sanislav et al., 2021). The reliance on external cloud services and communication technologies can hinder the implementation of IoT-based WQM systems. While commercial cloud services offer multiple benefits, the proper functioning of IoT devices relies on the continuous availability of these services, rendering them dependent on external entities. IoT devices relying on external cloud services are susceptible to increases in overall operational costs if companies raise their fees. Hence, when feasible, the IoT system should use customized cloud services based on local servers (Jan et al., 2021). Additionally, cloud service availability and pricing can vary depending on the country. Similarly, communication technologies like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular networking (2G, 3G, 4G, 5G) exhibit significant variations in accessibility and network strength contingent upon the geographical location (Borralho et al., 2021). Therefore, the selection of communication technology should consider infrastructure availability, volume of transmitted data, transmission frequency, transmission distance, and power source (Xu et al., 2019). IoT devices should also be designed to handle different network conditions, such as weak or intermittent signals. The constant connection to the Internet exposes IoT monitoring devices to cyberattacks. Vulnerabilities can exist in any of the layers of the IoT architecture, requiring that multiple security layers are implemented to protect the devices, communication channels, and applications that integrate the system (Kuzlu et al., 2021). Security measurements may include using authentication, access control, data encryption, threat and risk prediction, and intrusion detection (Rekha et al., 2023). Artificial Intelligence can be incorporated into IoT systems to enhance the detection, prevention, and response to anomalies or intrusions (Samriya et al., 2022; Wazid et al., 2022). Additionally, blockchain technology can provide an additional security layer by guaranteeing the traceability and immutability of the collected data (Han et al., 2023). Recent publications on IoT cybersecurity provide a comprehensive overview of the prevailing risks and state-of-the-art mitigation strategies (Sarker et al., 2023; Tariq et al., 2023). An aspect that remained to be addressed in the reviewed studies was the suitability of communication channels for delivering water quality results to the intended end-users. While twelve studies (80%) relied on online platforms accessible through smartphones or computers, three required data access from a local computer. The appropriateness of the selected communication channels depends on the end-user's preferences and the information's intended use (Behmel et al., 2018). Online platforms and instant messaging services effectively deliver real-time information to authorities or institutions, allowing timely WQM. However, diversifying communication channels is crucial when disseminating information directly to the public, as individuals may have varying preferences (DeVito, 2016). Additionally, some populations may have restricted internet access, limiting their ability to access water quality results. 4.2. Citizen science for water quality monitoring One of the critical aspects of successfully implementing a WQMP is sharing the generated information with the public and promoting participatory practices. The European Union Water Framework Directive (2014. 2000/60/EC) states its success “relies on close cooperation and coherent action at community, member state, and local level as well as on information, consultation, and involvement of the public, including users”. Also, SDG 6B aims to “support and strengthen the participation of local communities in improving water and sanitation management”. Participative approaches come with benefits such as raising public concern, gaining better acceptability of the projects, and gathering local and expert knowledge (Brouwer et al., 2018). Nevertheless, integrating public participation into WQMPs has been challenging not only because there are no clearly defined guidelines regarding the stage of the program in which this participation should be requested but also because public participation can take many forms depending on the context, resulting in variations in the objectives, the scope, the participants, and the structures at the local, regional, and national levels involved (Behmel et al., 2018). Despite the challenges, public participation should be considered, as the lack of incorporation of participatory practices can result in WQMPs that do not reflect the public's information needs (Behmel et al., 2016). Within participative approaches, citizen science, which involves the public's participation in scientific research and knowledge generation, has gained significance in recent decades (Jollymore et al., 2017). Citizen science is a non-traditional source of information relevant to achieving SDGs (Shulla et al., 2020). Traditional data sources, such as government ministries or institutions, currently provide the primary input of water quality data but face limitations such as low monitoring frequencies, and consequently, information becomes quickly outdated (Fritz et al., 2019). A further concern is that data are commonly reported on a national or regional scale, and local spatial variations are often overlooked (König et al., 2021). Citizen science can potentially improve temporal and spatial data resolution, overcoming the previous constraints on water quality data (San Llorente Capdevila et al., 2020). The recent interest in citizen science mainly derives from its multiple advantages beyond generating scientific knowledge, such as raising public awareness, promoting more effective legislation, and directing public spending towards priority areas (Fraisl et al., 2022). Moreover, citizen science contributes to an increase in the scientific literacy of the public participating in the project (Phillips et al., 2018). Citizens may participate in either some or multiple stages of the scientific process. These stages may include the formulation of the research question (Parris et al., 2023), co-designing of the project (Clarke et al., 2023), data collection (Moshi et al., 2022), data analysis (Hoyer and Canfield, 2021), and results communication (Araújo et al., 2022). Despite the previous advantages, implementing citizen science for WQM faces multiple challenges. One of the most significant concerns is the potential for data quality uncertainties (Burgess et al., 2017). Measurement uncertainties were reported to be a challenge for approximately 26% of the reviewed studies. Some of these uncertainties can be attributed to the nature of the methods used for determining water quality (Cakmak et al., 2021; Moshi et al., 2022). Testing kits, used in nearly 60% of the reviewed publications, are usually based on colorimetric methods to readily determine the values of water quality parameters such as nitrate and phosphate. However, participants may experience difficulties interpreting the test results and deciding the concentration range of a parameter based on the color (Quinlivan et al., 2020). While on-site probes offer the potential to enhance data accuracy in citizen science projects, they also present challenges. A study performed in Hong Kong where citizens were given a Horiba U-50 multiparameter water quality meter revealed that some participants found the measuring procedures very technical to follow, and sometimes they forgot or overlooked some minor steps or guidelines given to them in training (Ho et al., 2020). Similar findings were reported in a study conducted in Myanmar, where simple sensors outperformed a high-end multiparametric probe due to volunteers' difficulty in troubleshooting technical issues with the equipment, resulting in data loss and periods of inactivity (Thatoe Nwe Win et al., 2019). Furthermore, highly specialized equipment will increase monitoring costs, which is only feasible for some initiatives. Previous findings suggest that the technology employed for citizen science WQM should be affordable, user-friendly, and capable of generating accurate results. IoT devices and smartphone-based sensors hold promise in this regard. However, the systematic analysis only revealed one study regarding IoT devices and another on a smartphone-based sensor. The IoT device, deployed on small vessels employed for leisure or fishing in Italy, could monitor seawater temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and pH and automatically transmit the collected results to a database (Diviacco et al., 2021). The smartphone-based device was reported in a publication where students determined nitrate and phosphate concentrations in a river in China (Zheng et al., 2022). According to their respective authors, both devices provided accurate data. Apart from employing different technologies, multiple approaches can increase data quality at different project stages. The actions include volunteer training, validation with experts, peer reviews, the use of standardized protocols and calibrated tools, and the implementation of novel statistical analysis technologies (Fritz et al., 2019). In this regard, 85% of the examined articles either provided participant training, performed water quality data validation, or did both. The degree of quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) varied significantly among the projects. While some projects relied on outlier detection alone, citizen science organizations like Texas Stream Team and Florida LAKEWATCH have established robust QA/QC measures to produce high-quality water quality data. Shared salient measures of these organizations include (1) on-site participant training with annual refresher sessions, (2) implementation of standard operating procedures for field and laboratory analysis, (3) continuous evaluations of data precision and accuracy, (4) and comparison studies with professional organizations (Albus et al., 2020; Hoyer and Canfield, 2021). Appropriate training can ensure that the participants have the required information to produce data of sufficient quality. However, mandatory training may lower participation rates (Peeters et al., 2022). Therefore, training needs to be dynamic, accessible, inclusive, and appealing to achieve a good level of commitment from volunteers (Pérez-Belmont et al., 2019). Training can be provided using different approaches, such as videos, step-by-step guides, or workshops (Shupe, 2017; George et al., 2021; Hegarty et al., 2021). Training may also involve testing the skills of the volunteers by comparing their measurements with those taken by instructors and providing customized feedback on how to improve measurements (Shupe, 2017) or requiring participants to pass a test before being able to collect water quality data (Quinlivan et al., 2020). In addition to the specific project training, academic institutions such as Cornell University and University College London currently offer citizen science certifications that can help improve participants’ scientific knowledge and skills. Standardized procedures can also improve data quality by ensuring reproducibility, consistency, and comparability of measurements. Standardized procedures are particularly relevant to enhancing the scientific community and decision-makers' acceptance of the monitoring results (Brown and Williams, 2019). Citizen science projects can either develop their procedures or adhere to those established by other initiatives or organizations. Through its FreshWater Watch global project, international organizations such as Earthwatch Europe have established standardized measurement protocols, training, and quality control processes to increase the comparability of citizen-gathered data worldwide (Earthwatch Europe, 2023a). Another challenge, reported in 26% of the reviewed studies, is related to the engagement of citizen scientists. Reported issues include failing to recruit a sufficient number of participants (Diviacco et al., 2021), difficulties maintaining volunteer engagement (Biraghi et al., 2022; George et al., 2021; Peeters et al., 2022; Zheng et al., 2017), low levels of interest (Quinlivan et al., 2020), and time-consuming processes needed for engagement (Thornhill et al., 2018). In this regard, understanding participant motivations is fundamental to (1) developing tasks that align with multiple interests, (2) ensuring that these tasks meet participant expectations, (3) allowing for continuous volunteer feedback, and (4) integrating citizen scientists into co-design processes in the project (Fraisl et al., 2022). Motivation depends on the context, varies among participants, and may change over time. However, it has been reported that one of the citizen scientists' main motivations is to contribute towards environmental preservation (Jollymore et al., 2017; Lopez, 2021; Shupe, 2017). Thus, communicating how their participation contributes to this goal is essential to prevent participants' disappointment (Jollymore et al., 2017). Sustained participation will require developing projects considering participants' interests and designating staff to education, communication, and engagement activities (Peeters et al., 2022). Establishing partnerships with organizations or academic institutions can also improve the project's reach (George et al., 2021). While deficiencies in the project design may cause engagement issues, some contexts can be particularly challenging for implementing successful citizen science projects. As noted by Fraisl et al. (2022), in places that are affected by a high degree of social inequality, these initiatives may only result in the engagement of certain parts of society, excluding either or both citizens with low income and individuals belonging to underrepresented groups. In these situations, it is essential to implement strategies to enhance the participation of these groups. Providing economic incentives has proved successful in increasing and maintaining engagement (Zheng et al., 2017) and may be necessary to motivate the participation of low-income individuals. Spatial or geographical sampling bias is another concern observed in 26% of the reviewed citizen science projects. Sampling bias can be attributed to the project design as it mainly arises when volunteers are not assigned to monitor specific sampling locations. When participants are invited to self-select sampling locations, they often choose easily accessible areas or places of local interest (Bishop et al., 2020; Hegarty et al., 2021). This leads to more observations closer to urban centers and road networks. Volunteers may also prefer to monitor visually appealing sites, such as ponds in parks, over less scenic sites (McGoff et al., 2017). Additionally, a higher participation of city volunteers can lead to an overrepresentation of urban areas and an underrepresentation of rural regions (Biraghi et al., 2022). Project design can also lead to temporal bias or fewer observations. For instance, only 26% of the reviewed studies had a determined periodicity. When periodicity is not defined, volunteers may monitor water quality during their spare time, leading to more observations produced during weekends. In other cases, observations can be produced randomly upon finding polluted water (Zheng et al., 2017). Additionally, some projects integrate public events into their regular monitoring activities (e.g., monitoring campaigns with schools), resulting in a temporal increase in observations during the event (Biraghi et al., 2022). Geographical and temporal sampling biases are not entirely negative. Highly engaged individuals who frequently monitor a particular site are more likely to encounter abnormal events that can be undetected when using a higher spatial distribution approach (Jollymore et al., 2017). Furthermore, monitoring small local water bodies such as ponds, small streams, or ditches is valuable, as these water bodies are often overlooked by national and international legislation (McGoff et al., 2017; Thornhill et al., 2018). Lastly, it is relevant to consider that even though citizen science can increase spatiotemporal coverage and complement official databases in some instances, it is not designed to assume complete responsibility for WQM (Cakmak et al., 2021). Geographical and temporal sampling biases can be minimized through careful project design, collaboration with experts, and strategic sampling approaches. Defining specific sampling locations or constraining sampling areas can significantly reduce spatial bias while establishing a defined monitoring periodicity can address temporal bias. However, establishing spatial or temporal constraints results in a lower level of participation and, consequently, fewer observations (Jollymore et al., 2017; McKinley et al., 2017). The requirement to designate precise monitoring sites or sampling frequencies will ultimately be contingent on the project goals and should consider the repercussions for public involvement. When the project objective is to fill temporal gaps of an existing WQMP or validate data quality, monitoring points should match those used by professionals, as variations in sampling locations may impact the level of agreement between both datasets (Albus et al., 2020). Conversely, if the goal is to increase the spatial coverage or resolution of a WQMP, project leaders must select distinct monitoring points from those already monitored by professionals. Citizen initiatives should collaborate with government and academic institutions when establishing monitoring points and frequencies to maximize the value of the produced information. Coordination among stakeholders can facilitate the achievement of shared monitoring goals by distributing the efforts and necessary expenditures (Gradilla-Hernández et al., 2022). Securing participation when specific sampling locations and periodicity are essential can be challenging. However, some projects have obtained good results by integrating WQM into school activities or the participants' work. Araújo et al. (2022) incorporated middle school students into a citizen science WQM project to promote chemistry learning. In this initiative, teachers considered the participation of students in the project and designed the school year schedule to allow some of the project tasks to be completed during school hours, hence facilitating the project implementation. Another initiative involving a collaboration between the financial organization HSBC and Earthwatch promoted the participation of volunteer employees from HSBC by considering the project as part of their jobs (Pérez-Belmont et al., 2019). Nevertheless, applying the previous approaches in all contexts may not be feasible, requiring the project engagement strategies to be adapted to meet monitoring requirements. Though explicitly mentioned in only three studies, the underutilization of the results from citizen science studies on WQMP remains a critical issue demanding attention. This underutilization may stem from the perception that citizen-generated data is less reliable than the information produced by professional scientists. However, research has shown that citizens can provide valuable and reliable contributions of similar quality to those produced by professionals when adequate training, procedures, and methods are provided (Kosmala et al., 2016). Citizen science programs such as Texas Stream Team and Florida LAKEWATCH have relevant QA/QC protocols to comply with United States federal standards and have been producing high-quality information for decades, yet much of the information has remained underutilized (Albus et al., 2020; Hoyer and Canfield, 2021). Carlson and Cohen (2018) explored the relationships between citizen water monitoring and water initiatives led by the Canadian government. Their findings indicate that even though citizen organizations followed standardized monitoring protocols, less than half of them stated that their data is being used to inform government water policy. Furthermore, more cooperation was observed among citizen monitoring organizations than between citizen organizations and the government. The scientific value underestimation of citizens' data and the lack of effective communication must be assessed for the effective valorization of citizen science. Establishing partnerships among government agencies, scientific institutions, and citizen science groups is essential to designing and successfully implementing projects that fulfill shared requirements and achieve mutual goals (Agarwal et al., 2023). A topic that did not receive the required attention in the reviewed articles was evaluating the communication process in citizen science initiatives. None of the studies evaluated whether the general population understood their published results. Only one study tested whether participants understood water quality parameters better after the citizen science project (Araújo et al., 2022). Evaluating participants' understanding of the data they collected and its use is relevant for maintaining engagement (Lopez, 2021). In some initiatives, the transfer of information can be unidirectional from scientists to citizens or from more experienced participants to newly incorporated ones. The absence of a reciprocal knowledge exchange hinders the effective integration of contextual, traditional, and local knowledge, often recognized as valuable but surprisingly absent in many documented citizen science implementations (Jollymore et al., 2017). Lastly, it is essential to consider the channels used to communicate citizen-collected data. Most of the reviewed studies (∼78%) used either a website or a web-based platform to publish their results, followed by smartphone apps (∼11%) or social media (∼7%). While the public may prefer these channels in some contexts, communication strategies should be specifically designed for the place of implementation of citizen science projects. Communication channels dependent on the Internet may be unsuitable in places with limited access to this technology as they can exclude a significant part of the population. Moreover, only four reviewed studies indicated using multiple communication channels (Biraghi et al., 2022; George et al., 2021; Hegarty et al., 2021; H. Zheng et al., 2017). As discussed in the next section, employing multiple communication channels is needed to increase the likelihood that the information reaches the population, as some individuals may prefer one channel over another. Incorporating technological tools such as web-based platforms and mobile applications into WQM has multiple advantages, as these technologies can also be employed for data collection. Both tools can provide participants with a user-friendly interface to improve their understanding of the monitored ecosystem. Additionally, they can increase data quality as measurements can be georeferenced and timestamped before being captured into a server (Biraghi et al., 2022; George et al., 2021). These applications should be able to function offline to capture information in remote rural areas with low or non-existent internet connectivity (Cakmak et al., 2021). However, centering the project around these tools may decrease participation in contexts with reduced technological accessibility, requiring a mixed approach in which printed materials are used (US General Services Administration, 2023). Communication of citizen-collected data can be further improved by increasing the visibility of the initiative. Visibility can be enhanced through collaboration with widely recognized organizations or government agencies, allowing participants to use existing communication platforms to disseminate their findings to the public. Multiple citizen science initiatives publish their results in Earthwatch Europe's FreshWater Watch web platform, making their results available to people worldwide (Earthwatch Europe, 2023b). However, data quality concerns continue to hinder citizen science data communication by government institutions (de Sherbinin et al., 2021). Citizen scientists should collaborate closely with government agencies and the scientific community to establish consensus protocols and the quality standards needed to enable their data to be reported alongside official data (Fritz et al., 2019). 4.3. Water quality communication WQC, like any other form of communication, should follow a process. In general terms, communication is a two-way process in which a sender encodes a message that is transmitted through one or more channels to a receiver which decodes and interprets the message; where message interpretation is influenced by the context and can be affected by noise (DeVito, 2016). Effective communication involves clear messages being delivered using appropriate platforms, designed to target diverse audiences, and shared by trusted individuals (Hyland-Wood et al., 2021). Efficient communication is essential when sharing the results of WQMPs, as these are the indicators stakeholders use to evaluate the efficiency of management strategies (Behmel et al., 2018). One of the main challenges affecting WQC is the low message clarity produced by the complex coding of information. This issue has been identified in Customer Confidence Reports (CCR), which are water quality reports that community water systems or water utilities must provide each year to citizens in the United States. These reports contain information about the water source, regulated contaminants found in water, and potential health effects associated with those contaminants (US EPA, 2023a). Studies evaluating CCR readability have consistently found that these reports are difficult to read, requiring a specialized reading level. For instance, Nicholas and Vedachalam (2021) assessed the readability of 243 CCR distributed across the United States in 2020 using the Flesch Reading Ease Score (FRES), a tool widely employed to measure the complexity of a document and the difficulty of reading it. The FRES returns a value of 0 if the text is practically unreadable and 100 if it is easy to read (Flesch, 1948). The average CCR readability was 7.46, indicating that the documents require the reading level of a university graduate. Similar results were previously observed by Roy et al. (2015), who evaluated 30 CCR issued from 2011 to 2013 and found an average FRES of 36.35, corresponding to a university reading level. Providing the public with water quality information with a complexity like that found in university-level reading materials could create barriers for a substantial portion of the population. For instance, 48% of individuals aged 25 to 34 in OECD countries held a university degree or higher qualifications in 2021(OECD, 2022). This suggests that nearly half of the population within that age group may face challenges understanding CCR. Furthermore, comparing both studies shows that the readability ease of CCR has not increased in more than seven years, indicating that the topic has not received sufficient attention. Hence, the public keeps receiving information that can only be adequately interpreted by some individuals rather than being accessible to all citizens. Phetxumphou et al. (2015) evaluated the clarity of message communication of United States CCR by using the CDC's Clear Communication Index, a tool created to develop and assess public communication materials. This index evaluates the material in seven different areas using 20 items to provide an overall score from 0 to 100, where 100 represents complete clarity and 90 or higher is a passing score (CDC, 2019). All the assessed CCR obtained scores lower than the passing score, and the overall score across CCR was 50 ± 14. Based on the results, the authors concluded that a large proportion of the public will probably not understand the message provided by the CCR, and hence, they will not know the degree to which local water is safe to drink. Considering the preceding findings, an effort must be made to improve the clarity of water quality information. The public requires aid in interpreting water quality data to understand the risks of deviations in a particular parameter and the overall risks associated with using their water (Brouwer et al., 2020). Additionally, citizens must understand the available information to assess whether the designated authorities manage their water efficiently. The comprehension of water quality empowers citizens to instigate interventions from authorities as needed. The overall clarity of the transmitted information can be enhanced by implementing clear communication guidelines in water quality reports, such as the CDC's Clear Communication Index. According to some recommendations of the CDC's Clear Communication Index, documents should (1) contain one main message statement located at the beginning of the material and emphasized with visual cues (e.g., bolds, font size, color) to draw the attention from the reader; (2) have images or graphs that support the main message; (3) include one or more calls to action for the audience even when the purpose is to inform; (4) use active voice and words that are understood by the audience; (5) present information in an organized way using headings and lists when needed; (6) provide authoritative sources of information and recognize uncertainty; (7) present numbers that the main audience uses (avoid using scientific notation or very large or small numbers by adjusting measurement unit scale); (8) always explain what the numbers mean; and (9) present and explain associated risks (CDC, 2019). Another strategy to increase message clarity when presenting water quality information to the public is developing communication tools such as water quality indices (Ewaid et al., 2020; Woodward et al., 2021). These indices generally summarize water quality into a single number, allowing non-experts to quickly understand the status of water without the need to review each monitored parameter separately and try to interpret the units in which results are presented (Casillas-García et al., 2021; Fernández del Castillo et al., 2022). Indices are often used to report the water quality of water bodies and can serve as tools for stakeholders to evaluate the government's management of a water source once the results of a WQMP are obtained (Kachroud et al., 2019). While a single index can provide a general overview, employing multiple indices tailored to specific aspects of water quality, such as heavy metal or microbiological contamination, can offer more detailed insights into the types of pollution present (Haghnazar et al., 2022; Karaouzas et al., 2021). Visual aids such as color-coded scales can further enhance the public's understanding of these indices (Cham et al., 2020). One innovative approach is a graphical index developed by Sakai et al. (2018) that visualizes water quality using a heart shape, where a perfect heart represents clean water, and a fragmented heart indicates pollution. This index is expected to raise public awareness of water quality issues and facilitate community engagement. However, further research is needed to evaluate its effectiveness. A second issue with WQC concerns the selection of communication channels for message delivery. Dunn et al. (2014) identified that despite water quality information being reported annually by water suppliers in British Columbia, the public often remains unaware of its existence or does not know where to find it. Another study by Ochoo et al. (2017) in Newfoundland found a disconnection between public perception and actual water quality, suggesting that information was not disseminated appropriately. Prior research indicates that the mere publication of information is inadequate; it is imperative to ascertain the favored communication channels within each social context and tailor communication strategies accordingly. Behmel et al. (2018) performed a study to identify the knowledge needs, concerns, and preferred modes of communication on water quality and quantity from the public of two distinct watersheds in Quebec. Researchers found that the communication channel preferences diverged among the population and changed between watersheds. Citizens of the first watershed mostly preferred interactive maps, followed by municipal websites and notice boards. Citizens from the second watershed preferred interactive maps, followed by municipal websites and social media sites. The least preferred communication channels were special bulletins and television news for the first watershed and scientific papers and television news for the second watershed. Similarly, a study performed by Brouwer et al. (2020) in the Netherlands found that most citizens preferred water quality data to be offered via a website and that data were presented in different layers, allowing interested individuals to navigate from a general water quality summary to information about each parameter. Previous studies have shown that the public prefers to access information online through digital platforms. These platforms are valuable for achieving effective communication because they allow the information to be displayed interactively and using visual aids, which can be advantageous when communicating a topic such as water quality, where usually multiple parameters are reported simultaneously (Cham et al., 2020). Platforms may allow users to summarize data using charts, review data in a georeferenced way, or perform statistical analyses. Additionally, online platforms can communicate water quality indices alongside parameters to enhance the public's comprehension of water quality. Table 4 provides examples of platforms that communicate water quality to the public at different spatial levels. Table 4. Examples of digital platforms for water quality communication. Platform name Level Purpose Reference State of Bathing Waters International Provide information about coastal and inland bathing water locations and their quality within the European Union. European Environment Agency (2022) National Water Dashboard National Provide real-time stream, lake, and reservoirs, precipitation, and groundwater information from United States Geological Survey observation stations across the country. (U.S. Geological Survey, 2023) LAWA River Quality National Present river water quality information for multiple monitoring points throughout New Zealand. (Land, 2023) Protecting Florida Together Water Quality Status Map State Deliver water quality information of multiple water bodies located in Florida. Additionally, the map showcases ongoing restoration projects that are relevant to water quality issues. (Protecting Florida Together, 2023) Chesapeake Bay Watershed Data Dashboard Watershed Consolidate and provide accessibility within a single platform to information that can be used to guide watershed restoration efforts. (Lower Mississippi-Gulf Water Science Center, 2019) Decision support systems (DSS) can also be implemented within a digital platform. These systems aim to assist decision-making by harnessing data from different sources to provide objective advice and background support on solving complex problems (Zhai et al., 2020). DSS can also serve as a mechanism for transparency, as users can replicate the decision procedure and assess the decisions regarding feasibility, strength, and robustness (McIntosh et al., 2011). However, as discussed by Walling and Vaneeckhaute (2020), the effective implementation of DSS remains complex as there are challenges associated with (1) stakeholders’ participation, identification, and fulfillment of their expectations; (2) the selection and implementation of the models within the system; and (3) the system design in terms of the user interaction to obtain relevant results. Digital platforms can also be used to promote public engagement. Public engagement in government affairs can take multiple forms, ranging from only requesting feedback on the published information to seeking a sustained dialog to achieve consensual solutions to significant challenges (Bertot et al., 2010). Digital platforms can serve to fulfill both purposes. Platforms should not only function as channels to convey the status of a water body but also as systems that welcome and disseminate water quality data gathered by citizens, as well as proposals aimed at enhancing water quality and its communication. However, it is essential to consider that WQC should use more than just a single channel to reach the public because there are population groups that may not be interested in using digital platforms, do not have access to them, or prefer other communication channels. Therefore, it is vital to identify the preferred channels in the geographical context where water quality is being communicated and adapt the communication strategy to employ multiple channels (e.g., social media, newspapers, notice boards) to reach most of the population. Lastly, a third issue with WQC is the lack of bi-directionality or feedback. Evans and Carpenter (2019) studied how water utilities evaluate the effectiveness of CCR in terms of consumer understanding, engagement, and shaping water quality perceptions. The authors found that from 238 water utilities distributed across the United States, about 55% did not track consumer engagement or understanding of the CCR, 68% did not monitor consumer perceptions about water quality, and 46% did not use any methods to understand what information the public would like in their reports. Previous data emphasizes the need for incorporating mechanisms to receive or gather public feedback. Surveys or follow-up calls can be employed to evaluate public perceptions and their needs in terms of communication. A two-way communication is essential to evaluate the effectiveness of WQC and prevent misconceptions about water quality. Receiving feedback from the public is valuable as it can help institutions improve the readability, clarity, understandability, and accuracy of water quality communications (Evans and Carpenter, 2019). Government institutions such as the United States Environmental Protection and the US EPA, 2023b and state-level environmental agencies allow public involvement by accepting public comments, organizing public meetings and webinars when proposing regulations, or accepting public reports of environmental violations. However, there is still a need to establish and evaluate the efficacy of mechanisms aimed at constantly receiving feedback from the public on how to enhance WQC. Fischer et al. (2022) suggested that to facilitate communication bidirectionality, scientists and communicators should train key agents to become citizen scientists who can communicate water quality to the public. Central agents can include political leaders, religious leaders, educators, or government officials, who can contribute to distributing information through different channels such as word of mouth or social media. Nevertheless, as discussed in the preceding subsection, citizen science WQM initiatives still require the integration of mechanisms to identify the communication channels preferred by the public and to monitor their comprehension of the transmitted water quality information. Integrating the former mechanisms and clear communication tools within these initiatives can transform them into a more valuable channel for WQC. 5. Future perspectives While IoT and citizen science offer valuable alternatives for monitoring water quality, these approaches must address certain limitations to establish themselves as robust sources of water quality information. The reviewed literature concerning the implementation of IoT-based WQM devices underscores the necessity for (1) increasing their robustness to withstand changing environmental conditions, (2) solving the need for regular cleaning and calibration of the sensors to prevent fouling and ensure accurate readings, (3) increasing the energy efficiency of their components and reliability of their power sources, (4) ensuring the continuous provision of cloud services, and (5) implementing robust security measures to safeguard against data breaches and cyberattacks and guarantee data traceability. Further advancements in the IoT technologies focused on WQM will allow the development of more robust devices at reduced costs, promoting the incorporation of IoT into WQMPs. Citizen science projects must surmount obstacles like (1) minimizing measurement uncertainties, (2) sustaining citizen engagement, (3) reducing sampling bias, (4) increasing the number of observations and collected data, and (5) establishing trust among scientists and authorities. Citizen initiatives should continue incorporating and improving their mechanisms to guarantee data quality. Projects should be designed considering that each context is different and constantly changing; thus, the initiative should have sufficient flexibility to adapt to changes in participant interests to maintain engagement. Citizen science initiatives should collaborate with governments and academic institutions to build and execute projects that meet shared objectives. These partnerships will play a pivotal role in elevating their public visibility, expanding avenues for funding, and shifting the prevailing perception of limited data reliability. In addition to preceding concerns, future citizen science and IoT projects should evaluate if their communication channels suit their intended end-users, especially when aiming to communicate with the public. Mechanisms to evaluate the effectiveness of WQC should be incorporated into the design of IoT and citizen science initiatives. Without integrating these mechanisms, the former monitoring approaches will continue to increase the amount of water quality data but not the public understanding of water bodies. While we did not analyze data-sharing practices among different users in this study, we encourage the adoption of FAIR principles (findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability) to facilitate the appropriate sharing of data generated by these projects among stakeholders (Wilkinson et al., 2016). Although multiple IoT and citizen science WQM projects have been reviewed, the extent of this study did not encompass citizen science and IoT implementations focused on using technologies like remote sensing or uncrewed vehicles, nor WQM projects focusing on groundwater, aquaculture, and agriculture. Therefore, further studies on the former applications are needed, which could offer valuable insights into common challenges and potential solutions. Similarly, this work considered only peer-reviewed publications, excluding project reports, websites, and non-academic works from which practical conclusions can be obtained, especially regarding citizen science and WQC. Lastly, addressing the shortcomings of current water quality communication practices requires the implementation of strategies that (1) enhance message clarity, (2) align communication channels with public preferences, and (3) foster bidirectional communication. Well-established guidelines such as the CDC's Clear Communication Index can be employed to make the information accessible to a wide range of audiences. Tools like water quality indices should be employed to facilitate water quality understanding. The choice of communication channels should be informed by research on public preferences within each context. Multiple channels are required to guarantee more extensive outreach across diverse audience segments. Additionally, communicators should be open to receiving feedback and incorporate mechanisms to promote public participation in water quality affairs. Enhancing the comprehension of water quality will enable citizens to evaluate the impact of their actions and the effectiveness of management practices implemented by authorities in safeguarding our invaluable water resources. A summary of the key challenges and recommendations is provided in Table 5. Table 5. Identified challenges and suggestions for IoT, citizen science, and communication in water quality monitoring.

Conclusions IoT and citizen science pose promising alternatives for WQM, providing supplementary data that can address the spatiotemporal limitations of existing WQMPs relying on conventional monitoring methods. IoT delivers timely water quality information with high temporal resolution, allowing for enhanced environmental surveillance. Citizen science enhances public awareness and understanding of water quality while closing spatiotemporal monitoring gaps through data collected by regular citizens. However, both fields face challenges that need to be addressed. IoT WQM devices need improved robustness, power efficiency, data security, cloud services, and sensor cleaning and calibration methods. Citizen science projects must minimize measurement uncertainties, reduce sampling biases, increase the collected data, sustain participant engagement, and establish trust relationships with scientists and policymakers. Furthermore, scientists and practitioners need to focus on improving water quality communication with the public and develop projects integrating this aspect into their design.

This strains vital water and energy resources, especially in the face of the worsening challenges of climate change and population growth. A novel method is presented that integrates micro-hydropower plants, with pumps as turbines (PATs), in the water network in the city of Funchal. Sensitivity analyses evaluated the microgrid’s response to variations in the cost of energy components, showing favorable outcomes with positive net present value (NPV). PV solar and micro-wind turbines installed exclusively at the selected PRV sites within the Funchal hydro grid generate a combined 153 and 55 MWh/year, respectively, supplementing the 406 MWh/year generated by PATs. It should be noted that PATs consistently have the lowest cost of electricity (LCOE), confirming their economic viability and efficiency across different scenarios, even after accounting for reductions in alternative energy sources and grid infrastructure costs. Keywords: water infrastructures; hybrid energy solutions; water networks; EPANET; HOMER; PAT; solar PV; wind; LCOE 1. Introduction By managing natural resources, society exerts significant pressure on the natural environment [1]. There is a threat of systemic collapse. As a result, many industrialized nations have begun implementing green energy strategies, reaching over 10% of total energy production [2]. The projection of energy consumption, especially in regions under significant urbanization pressure and associated carbon dioxide emissions, poses a formidable challenge to society [3]. The acceleration of economic development and rising standards of living have made energy security a top priority for policy makers worldwide [4]. This predicament requires a city to take innovative approaches to resource management to improve the quality of life for its residents. Achieving these goals is consistent with the imperative to minimize resource use, leading to increased sustainability efforts [5]. Water research has provided clear evidence on the global dimension of the water challenge and the role of humans as a chief force shaping the global water cycle [6,7]. Water infrastructures, in particular, are characterized by high energy consumption, ranging from 0.2 to 4.08 kWh/m3 [8]. This energy is mainly obtained from pumping stations. It includes the energy required to perform various processes and distribution activities. Renewable resources such as solar, wind, and hydropower offer viable alternatives for providing this energy and reducing dependence on non-renewable sources [9]. Using renewable energy systems involves integrating hybrid pumped storage, photovoltaic, and wind turbine systems in conjunction with battery storage [10]. The synergistic use of these technologies enables water utilities to operate their water systems independently of the conventional grid infrastructure [11], in which the pumped hydro-storage is a real infrastructure to manage the renewable production [12]. Numerous research studies have used heuristic methods to develop flexible solutions for hybrid system optimization [13]. Parameters such as temperature, wind speed, and solar radiation significantly impact the optimization of these hybrid systems, as found by [14]. Moreover, a comprehensive review of different techniques for hybrid system optimization has been given in [15]. For this purpose, various algorithms have been used, including genetic algorithms for solar and wind systems in Hong Kong [16], particle swarm optimization for power generation in Rafsanjan (Iran) ranging from 42 to 80 kW [17], and an imperialistic competition algorithm for a 1450 kW hybrid system in Pulau Perhentian (Malaysia) [18]. Harmony search methods were used by [19] to optimize the components of the hybrid system with a power of 1 kW. Researchers [20] formulated an approach for optimal sizing of distributed power generation by photovoltaic and diesel generator systems using energy management and size optimization through a new approach for an islanding solution. The gray wolf optimization method was used to determine the optimal number of PV panels, wind turbines, and battery banks while considering the minimum annual cost [21]. Another optimization of hybrid systems focusing on minimizing electricity costs was performed using the firefly-inspired algorithm [22]. In contrast, harmony search methods were used to minimize life cycle costs in a hybrid system in Ardabil (Iran) [23]. Evolutionary algorithms and artificial bee swarm optimization were also used to optimize various hybrid systems, such as the 7 kW system in Rafsanjan [24] and the 5 kW system [25]. On the other hand, examples of hybrid system sizing using the big bang–big crunch method were presented in [26], with an optimized power target of 3715 kW. In [27], using HOMER software, a performance analysis of off-grid hybrid power systems in remote areas was carried out, minimizing the net present cost and CO2 emissions. In addition, HOMER was used to optimize hydro systems with hydropower and photovoltaic plants in Lisbon (Portugal) [28]. The authors of [29] developed an optimized methodology using simulated annealing for hybrid systems involving photovoltaic and micro-hydropower systems with pumps as turbines (PATs), achieving an annual reduction of 2838 tons of CO2 emissions and 553 MWh of energy generated from non-renewable sources in Spanish irrigation systems. The feasibility of similar systems in remote cities, such as the Bahamas, was investigated in a case study by [30]. Integrating these technologies into water management is essential to improve the water–energy nexus. This aligns with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and enables adaptation to the challenges of climate change while reducing greenhouse gas emissions [31]. Numerous studies highlight how implementing operational strategies can significantly improve the sustainability of water distribution networks while optimizing energy management [31]. Following the references above, energy communities can use associations, cooperatives, partnerships, nonprofit organizations, or small/medium businesses to facilitate citizen participation and joint investment in energy assets [32]. This collaborative approach contributes to a decarbonized and more flexible energy system, as energy communities can act as a unified entity that can access renewable energy markets in different combinations and at a smaller scale [33]. By upgrading the water sector, an essential service for the population, energy communities can contribute to grid flexibility through adaptive demand reduction mechanisms [34]. In summary, energy communities offer an opportunity to reshape how society perceives and integrates essential variables such as water and energy satisfaction. By harnessing available renewable energy sources, citizens can actively participate in the energy transition, resulting in significant benefits for all. Pressure-reducing valves (PRVs) are used in water distribution networks to ensure standardization and regulation of pressure, dividing the water network into pressure zones according to topographical conditions. The operation of PRVs results in a localized loss of pressure and, thus, a loss of hydraulic energy due to a lower outlet pressure. PRVs generate controlled pressure and flow zones where an efficient management of water losses becomes possible, allowing for faster detection and response [35,36,37]. Pumps as turbines (PATs) provide an alternative means of pressure control in water distribution networks (WDNs) and increase system efficiency and flexibility. However, the main disadvantage of PATs is the lack of flow device control, which leads to suboptimal efficiency when flow rates fluctuate. For WDNs, flow and head pattern fluctuations can reduce overall energy production due to low efficiency at partial load and the inability to provide the required head for suitable operational conditions. In general, manufacturers do not provide the characteristics of PATs, which is one of the biggest challenges for their application. Under stable operating conditions, pressure-reducing valves (PRVs) and PATs exhibit similar behavior. Therefore, PATs are a viable alternative for generating sustainable energy at low cost. Despite the drawbacks and challenges of implementing PATs, they offer a compelling alternative for harnessing hydropower and improving system efficiency. This results in reduced dependence on other energy sources and induces lower operating costs. Integrating PATs into WDNs can improve water, energy, and cost management in intelligent water grids and is an important step toward developing future smart cities [38,39,40,41,42,43,44]. The addition of strategies to improve the sustainability of water systems is crucial to reach the zero-emission balance [45,46,47]. Hence, this research proposes a new strategy that includes different optimized methods, both hydraulic and energetic, that allow for improving the management of water distribution systems to analyze the possibility of combining different renewable systems to meet energy needs in small energy communities [48,49]. The development of this research enables the establishment of a green management proposal, which allows water managers the development of new strategies to improve sustainability in the water sector [50]. 2. Materials and Methods The methodology used in this study includes the use of water networks that supply water to local communities, focusing on identifying possible optimal locations for pressure-reducing valves (PRVs), controlling the pressure in the network, for the recovery of water energy (e.g., pumps as turbines—PATs) to generate hydropower. Next, (i) hydraulic simulation (ii) can be used to identify the implementation of PATs and (iii) the energy simulation with complementarity between other renewable sources to generate an optimal hybrid small energy solution that (iv) allows for the analysis of microgrids in an economical way through the best combination of renewable systems (Figure 1). Figure 1. Flow chart of the proposed integrated methodology. 2.1. Hydraulic Model Simulator The hydraulic simulation methods used in the analysis of water distribution networks rely on the EPANET model (or equivalent) developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (Figure 2). This model allows for both static simulations and simulations over time so that hydraulic behavior and flow and pressure distribution throughout the network can be evaluated. Figure 2. Hydraulic simulator methodology. The EPANET simulator (2.2) is widely known and considered one of the most widely used software applications for water system simulation. EPANET uses the “gradient method” to derive equations governing the principles of continuity, energy conservation, and the relationship between flow and pressure drop, all of which characterize hydraulic equilibrium within a piping system. The continuity of flow at a node is governed by Equation (1), while Equation (2) establishes the relationship between flow and pressure drop in a pipeline segment from node i to j. Equation (3) specifies the demand for each branch of the pipeline network. ∑ 𝑗 𝑎𝑖𝑗  𝑄 𝑖𝑗 + 𝐷 𝑖 =0 𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑖=1,…𝑁 (1) 𝐻 𝑖 − 𝐻 𝑘 = ℎ 𝑖𝑘 =𝑟 𝑄 𝑛−1 𝑖𝑗 (2) 𝐿 𝑓 =𝑘· 𝐿 𝑖 ·𝑁 (3) where 𝐷 𝑖 is the demand in each node (by convention, the flow that arrives at the node is positive) (L/s) , 𝐻 𝑖 is the nodal head (m) , ℎ is the head loss (m) , 𝑟 is the resistance coefficient, 𝑄 is the flow rate (L/s) , 𝑛 is the flow estimation orifice leak exponent, Lf is the fictitious pipe length, L is the real pipe length, and N is the number of building floors. The coefficient k depends on the line service, whether on both sides, at just one side, or with no service. Thereby, knowing the head of the fixed nodes, it is possible to obtain the heads,  𝐻 𝑖 , and flows,  𝑄 𝑖𝑗 , of the network that satisfies Equations (1)–(3). The water resource calculation involves multiplying the peak flow observed at each valve by the corresponding hourly demand curve. 2.2. Energy Recovery with PATs Implementing pump-as-turbine (PAT) systems in energy recovery involves identifying key parameters, such as flow rate and available head, to estimate power output. In addition, pressure-reducing valves (PRVs) are critical in maintaining pressure control within the network. Installation of PAT systems is defined in terms of various modes of operation, including no control (NR); hydraulic control (HR), which includes additional valves in the main line and PAT bypass; energy control (ER), which is achieved by variable operating speed (VOS) of the PAT impeller; or a combination of both (HER) (as shown in Figure 3, Figure 4 and Figure 5). Figure 3. PAT implementation methodology. Figure 4. Scheme of a PAT in a pipe system (a), with hydraulic and/or electrical regulation (HR, ER, HER) (b). Figure 5. Scheme for single–serial–parallel (SSP) PAT mode (a), characteristic curves for SSP modes (b). Once the locations for the pressure-reducing valves (PRVs) are identified, a characteristic curve of the installation (CCI) is generated based on the measured inlet and outlet pressures at the PRV nodes. This CCI illustrates the relationship between flow rate and available head within the hydraulic system. An appropriate characteristic curve for a pump as turbine (CCPAT) is then selected that matches the hydraulic characteristics of the network. In defining the CCPAT, various maximum heads are established to match local pressure conditions and ensure optimal utilization for power generation. The CCPAT curves are carefully matched to the flow rate and head in the system to maximize the extraction of available hydroelectric energy. The point where the characteristic curve of the system intersects with the characteristic curve of the PAT defines the operating point of the turbine. To simulate the implementation of pump-as-turbine (PAT) systems, the pressure-reducing valves (PRVs) in the EPANET model are replaced by general-purpose valves associated with the corresponding turbine characteristics. Then, following the principles of hydraulic similarity, characteristic curves are defined for different speeds (in an energy regulation mode). The relationship between electric power and hydraulic power generates several efficiency points that facilitate the preparation of an efficiency analysis. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of energy recovery within the pilot zone of the Funchal water network through the use of PATs. Instead of replacing the PRVs in the distribution network, an alternative approach was adopted based on practical conditions. Since ensuring adequate water supply and controlling leakage are higher priorities, measures were taken to prevent any degradation of the existing pressure level in the system. The PATs were strategically positioned in series ahead of the PRVs to prevent a pressure rise in the event of a malfunction of the PAT. Various PAT configurations for power generation can be applied, as depicted in Figure 4, offering flexibility in implementing this technology. The primary objective in water distribution networks is to control water losses, as this is the most important means of conserving energy and water resources. This need is of financial importance to water utilities globally and results in significant savings across the spectrum of water-related processes that include extraction, treatment, transport, and distribution. In water supply systems (WSSs), hydraulic energy resources are sometimes abundant. This inherent characteristic makes water pipelines potential sources of renewable energy. Notably, discharge nodes exhibit constant daily variations in flow rates and heads. Consequently, accurate knowledge of energy availability is critical in predicting and delineating the economic benefits of using less energy for power generation. Control valves (CVs) are strategically positioned within water networks to separate regions of significant topographic elevation differences or reduce the remaining flow head at the end of pipelines. On the other hand, pressure-reducing valves (PRVs) are used to relieve excessive pressure in the network. However, converting excess pressure into electrical energy through pump-as-turbine systems (PAT) encounters certain limitations. The main difficulty in implementing PATs is the constant fluctuation of hydraulic conditions, characterized by varying flow rates and pressures depending on demand. The problems with energy recovery in water networks can be solved by utilizing a unique planning technique called variable operating strategy (VOS). PATs are made useful as energy generators in the water sector by VOS, which takes into account the temporal variations in flow rates and pressures. Hydraulic regulation (HR) and electric regulation (ER) can both benefit from the effective application of VOS to account for the fluctuating operating conditions brought on by daily water demands. It is crucial to integrate a control system for PATs in order to handle the fluctuating operating conditions brought on by daily water demand. Figure 4 illustrates the various PAT operating states: a) In hydraulic control mode (HR), the PAT installation scheme consists of two branches: a control valve and a PAT are connected in series in the first branch, which is the discharge/production branch; a regulating valve is installed in the second branch, which is the bypass (Figure 4a). When the head is available in HR mode—Hd is greater than the head that the machine supplies, Ht (points above the PAT characteristic—Figure 4b)—the excess pressure is released by the series-connected valve (Valve A). On the other hand, if Qd exceeds the available head (indicated by points below the PAT characteristic in Figure 4b), then a head higher than what is available is produced by the PAT. In such cases, Valve B opens up to lower the discharge from Qd to Qt within the PAT. To avoid exceeding the available head, the PAT is equipped with a bypass valve. When operating in ER mode, the generator’s speed adjusts to correspond with both flow rate and head at any given moment. Meanwhile, regardless of mode (HER), desired results are achieved by selecting an appropriate combination of valve regulation and machine rotational operating speed [34,35,36,37]. A variable operating strategy (VOS) employed within water distribution systems can optimize performance for both HR and ER modes via idealizing PAT selection. As far as mathematical considerations go, NR mode delivery occurs when points align on characteristic curve-to-network flow rates (as seen in Equation (4)): 𝐻 𝑡 = 𝐻 𝑡 ( 𝑄 𝑑 ) (4) where 𝐻 𝑡 is the net head delivered by the PAT (m) and 𝑄 𝑑 is the available discharge ( m 3 /s ). In no regulation (NR) mode, three working regions can be defined as follows: Region 1— 𝑄 𝑖 < 𝑄 𝑡,𝑚𝑖𝑛 : 𝐸𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑦=0 ; Region 2— 𝑄 𝑖 > 𝑄 𝑡,𝑚𝑎𝑥 or 𝑄 𝑡,𝑚𝑖𝑛 < 𝑄 𝑖 < 𝑄 𝑡,𝑚𝑎𝑥 and 𝐻 𝑡 > 𝐻 𝑖 : 𝐸𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑦=0 ; Region 3— 𝑄 𝑡,𝑚𝑖𝑛 < 𝑄 𝑖 < 𝑄 𝑡,𝑚𝑎𝑥   and 𝐻 𝑡 < 𝐻 𝑖 : 𝐸=𝑃( 𝑄 𝑖 )Δ 𝑡 𝑖 . where 𝑄 𝑖 ,  𝐻 𝑖 are the flow and the available head in the instant i; 𝑄 𝑡 , 𝐻 𝑡 are the turbine flow and the net head delivered by the PAT; P is the power; and ∆t is the operation period. “min” and “max” are the operating extreme values of the PAT. In HR mode, the rotational speed of the PAT is fixed, and Valves (A) and (B) control the flow through the machine (Equation (5)): ⎧ ⎩ ⎨         𝐻 𝑑 = 𝐻 𝑡 ( 𝑄 𝑡 )+ 𝐻 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑣𝑒 𝑄 𝑑 = 𝑄 𝑡 + 𝑄 𝑏𝑦𝑝𝑎𝑠𝑠 𝐻 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑣𝑒 >0, 𝑄 𝑏𝑦𝑝𝑎𝑠𝑠 =0 𝑖𝑓  𝐻 𝑡 ( 𝑄 𝑡 )< 𝐻 𝑑 𝐻 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑣𝑒 =0, 𝑄 𝑏𝑦𝑝𝑎𝑠𝑠 >0 𝑖𝑓  𝐻 𝑡 ( 𝑄 𝑑 )> 𝐻 𝑑 (5) where 𝐻 𝑑 , 𝐻 𝑡 are the available and the PAT head (m) ;  𝐻 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑣𝑒 is the head delivered by the valve (m) ; 𝑄 𝑡 ,  𝑄 𝑑 are the turbine discharge ( m 3 /s) and the available discharge ( m 3 /s) ; 𝑄 𝑏𝑦𝑝𝑎𝑠𝑠 is the bypass discharge ( m 3 /s) . In HR mode, four working regions can be defined: Region 1— 𝑄 𝑖 < 𝑄 𝑡,𝑚𝑖𝑛 or 𝐻 𝑖 < 𝐻 𝑡,𝑚𝑖𝑛 : 𝐸𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑦=0 ; Region 2— 𝑄 𝑡,𝑚𝑖𝑛 < 𝑄 𝑖 < 𝑄 𝑡,𝑚𝑎𝑥   and 𝐻 𝑖 > 𝐻 𝑡 ( 𝑄 𝑖 ) : 𝐸𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑦=𝑃( 𝑄 𝑖 )Δ 𝑡 𝑖 ; Region 3— 𝑄 𝑡,𝑚𝑖𝑛 < 𝑄 𝑖 < 𝑄 𝑡,𝑚𝑎𝑥 and 𝐻 𝑡,𝑚𝑖𝑛 < 𝐻 𝑖 < 𝐻 𝑡,𝑚𝑎𝑥 : 𝐸𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑦=𝑃( 𝑄 𝑡 ( 𝐻 𝑖 ))Δ 𝑡 𝑖 ; Region 4— 𝑄 𝑖 > 𝑄 𝑡,𝑚𝑎𝑥 and 𝐻 𝑖 > 𝐻 𝑡,𝑚𝑎𝑥 : 𝐸𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑦=𝑃( 𝑄 𝑡,𝑚𝑎𝑥 )Δ 𝑡 𝑖 . In HER mode, the HR and the ER modes are coupled to improve the performance of the PAT (Equation (6)): ⎧ ⎩ ⎨         𝐻 𝑑 = 𝐻 𝑡 ( 𝑄 𝑡 , 𝑁 𝑡 )+ 𝐻 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑣𝑒 𝑄 𝑑 = 𝑄 𝑡 ( 𝑁 𝑡 )+ 𝑄 𝑏𝑦𝑝𝑎𝑠𝑠 𝐻 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑣𝑒 >0, 𝑄 𝑏𝑦𝑝𝑎𝑠𝑠 =0 𝑖𝑓  𝐻 𝑡 ( 𝑄 𝑡 , 𝑁 𝑡 )< 𝐻 𝑑 𝐻 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑣𝑒 =0, 𝑄 𝑏𝑦𝑝𝑎𝑠𝑠 >0 𝑖𝑓  𝐻 𝑡 ( 𝑄 𝑑 , 𝑁 𝑡 )> 𝐻 𝑑 (6) In HER mode, Valves (A) and (B) work together with the rotational speed regulation, allowing for better control of flow and head to maximize the energy production. Four working regions can be defined as follows: Region 1— 𝑄 𝑖 < 𝑄 𝑡,𝑚𝑖𝑛 or 𝐻 𝑖 < 𝐻 𝑡,𝑚𝑖𝑛 : 𝐸𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑦=0 ; Region 2— 𝑄 𝑡,𝑚𝑖𝑛 < 𝑄 𝑖 < 𝑄 𝑡,𝑚𝑎𝑥 and 𝐻 𝑖 > 𝐻 𝑡 ( 𝑄 𝑖 , 𝑁 𝑡 ) : 𝐸𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑦=𝑃( 𝑄 𝑖 )Δ 𝑡 𝑖 ; Region 3— 𝑄 𝑡,𝑚𝑖𝑛 ( 𝑁 𝑡 )< 𝑄 𝑖 < 𝑄 𝑡,𝑚𝑎𝑥  ( 𝑁 𝑡 ) and 𝐻 𝑡,𝑚𝑖𝑛 ( 𝑄 𝑡 , 𝑁 𝑡 )< 𝐻 𝑖 < 𝐻 𝑡 ( 𝑄 𝑖 , 𝑁 𝑡 ) : 𝐸𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑦=𝑃( 𝑄 𝑡 ( 𝐻 𝑖 ( 𝑁 𝑡 ))Δ 𝑡 𝑖 ; Region 4— 𝑄 𝑖 > 𝑄 𝑡,𝑚𝑎𝑥 ( 𝑁 𝑡 ) and 𝐻 𝑖 > 𝐻 𝑡,𝑚𝑎𝑥 ( 𝑁 𝑡 ) : 𝐸𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑦=𝑃( 𝑄 𝑡,𝑚𝑎𝑥 ( 𝑁 𝑡 ))Δ 𝑡 𝑖 . In these modes, the optimization process aims to achieve the combined values of flow ( 𝑄) and head ( 𝐻) that maximize the energy production. In order to face the limitations of the PAT operation for small flow values, a new PAT regulation strategy can also be presented: single–serial–parallel regulation mode (SSP). In SSP mode, the installation comprises two PATs and three on/off valves [34,35,36,37] (Figure 5). The installation scheme of the SSP mode is illustrated in Figure 5a. The SSP mode has three different working conditions that vary based on the daily demand, as depicted in Figure 5b). These conditions are as follows: (i) valve I and PAT A are on while valves II and III plus PAT B remain off, leading to a single energy-producing PAT; (ii) both valves II and III along with PATs A and B are turned on while valve I is off, resulting in series production of energy by the two PATs; (iii) both valves I and III are open with PAT A and B running parallel, resulting in double the flow compared to operating condition (i). An increased head for serial-operated turbines was observed during operation condition (ii), shown in Figure 5b, compared to a single turbine under operating state (i). Consequently, the flow rate doubled when parallel operating turbines were employed (under operating condition (iii)), also demonstrated in Figure 5b. Thus, it can be concluded that using the SSP mode is practical for recovering energy in small energy communities [34,35,36,37]. 2.3. Energy Simulator The next step is to develop simulations in the HOMER model (Figure 6), for which the site and load data requirements must first be determined. The location for the project’s case study is on Madeira Island. HOMER downloads data from NASA POWER to obtain wind speeds and solar radiation data. Figure 6. Energy simulator methodology. The load for the selected project must be entered into the model. The components for the microgrid must also be selected. Renewable components include photovoltaic, wind, and hydropower (PAT). Once the renewable components have been selected, their specifications and costs must be determined. Some of the specifications are already available in the HOMER library. For the cost specifications, experts in the field can be consulted, or various platforms that provide a cost estimate for components based on their capacity can be adapted. After all the data are entered, HOMER optimizes the hybrid system based on many combinations. These results also show electrical and economic results, which can be used for further analysis. 2.4. Energy Production Power generation from pumps as turbines (PATs) is effectively analyzed and tracked using the HOMER energy optimization model. HOMER uses a grid search algorithm and a proprietary derivative-free algorithm to determine the most cost-effective microgrid model that meets load demand. The location chosen for these simulations is the city of Funchal in the Madeira Islands. The results of these simulations will provide valuable insight into the performance of PATs in power generation, especially when combined with hydropower. Specific data inputs are required to perform these simulations, including load requirements, capital and operating costs, replacement costs for all energy systems to be installed, and the availability of resources such as solar, wind, hydro, and biomass at the project site. The software obtains solar, wind, and temperature data from NASA’s Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resource database. To evaluate hydropower production with PATs, energy components such as solar arrays, wind turbines, hydropower, and grid connections are selected for the simulations. Considering the different water demands, the flow rates are determined. Winter flow is calculated as 0.7 times summer flow. In comparison, spring and fall flows are assumed to be 0.85 times summer flow, with the highest demand occurring in the summer. The simulation model shown in Figure 6 includes photovoltaic systems, wind turbines, the power grid, PATs (hydro turbines), a battery for storage, and an inverter to convert DC from photovoltaic systems to AC. For flows below 35 L/s, a 5 kW water turbine is used, while for flows above 35 L/s, a 10 kW water turbine is used. The model specifies these flow rates, with a nominal flow of 35 L/s for the 5 kW water turbine and 70 L/s for the 10 kW water turbine. The efficiency of the water turbines is set at 80% for both. The simulations are performed over a project life of 25 years, considering an inflation rate of 2% and a discount rate. To get as close as possible to real-time consumption patterns, hourly electricity consumption data for Portugal were taken from an open-source database from the website REN [42]. Then, the data adjustment was defined to represent the energy consumption at a smaller municipality level. The load data used in the simulations from HOMER show a peak electricity demand of 9.94 kW and an average daily energy consumption of 160.44 kWh. Over the year, the average electricity consumption is 6.68 kW. It is noteworthy that the highest monthly peak load occurs in January. A visual representation of the load distribution in each month can be found in Figure 7, which shows the load box plot for each month. Figure 7. Box plot of load demand considered for the simulations. Solar PV uses solar radiation to generate electricity. The use of solar PV renewable energy systems has been growing rapidly in recent years. The calculation of electricity generated by solar PV in the model is calculated as follows: 𝑃 𝑃𝑉 = 𝑌 𝑃𝑉 𝑓 𝑃𝑉 ( 𝐺 𝑇 𝐺 𝑇,𝑆𝑇𝐶 ) [1+ 𝛼 𝑃 ( 𝑇 𝑐 − 𝑇 𝑐,𝑆𝑇𝐶 )] (7) where 𝑌 𝑃𝑉 = power output during standard test conditions in kW. 𝑓 𝑃𝑉 = derating factor of solar PV. 𝐺 𝑇 = incident solar irradiance in kW/ m 2 . 𝐺 𝑇,𝑆𝑇𝐶 = incident solar irradiance at Standard test conditions, which is 1 kW/ m 2 . 𝛼 𝑃 = temperature co-efficient of power. 𝑇 𝑐 = cell temperature of solar PV in °C. 𝑇 𝑐,𝑆𝑇𝐶 = cell temperature under standard test conditions, which is 25 °C. Another renewable energy system growing in today’s market is wind energy. Many innovative wind turbine models are on the rise to harness wind energy on both large and small scales. The wind turbine considered for the case study simulation is a generic 3 kW wind turbine predefined by the model. It first calculates the wind speed at hub height using the following equation: 𝑈 ℎ𝑢𝑏 = 𝑈 𝑎𝑛𝑒𝑚 · ln( 𝑍 ℎ𝑢𝑏 𝑍 0 ) ln( 𝑍 𝑎𝑛𝑒𝑚 𝑍 0 ) (8) where 𝑈 ℎ𝑢𝑏 = wind speed at the hub height of the wind turbine in m/s. 𝑈 𝑎𝑛𝑒𝑚 = wind speed at the anemometer height in m/s. 𝑍 ℎ𝑢𝑏 = hub height of the wind turbine in m. 𝑍 0 = the surface roughness length in m. 𝑍 𝑎𝑛𝑒𝑚 = anemometer height in m. After calculating the wind speed at hub height, the model considers the wind turbine’s power curve to calculate the power generated by the wind turbine under standard temperature and pressure conditions. To obtain the power generated under real conditions, the model uses the following equation: 𝑃 𝑊𝑇𝐺 =( 𝜌 𝜌 0 )· 𝑃 𝑊𝑇𝐺,𝑆𝑇𝑃 (9) where 𝑃 𝑊𝑇𝐺 = output power of wind turbine in kW. 𝑃 𝑊𝑇𝐺,𝑆𝑇𝑃 = output power of wind turbine at standard temperature and pressure in kW. 𝜌 = actual air density in kg/ m 3 . 𝜌 0 = air density at STP, which is 1.225 kg/ m 3 . Hydropower is one of the oldest techniques of energy generation. For this research, a 5 kW hydro turbine was chosen for lower flow rates and a 10 kW hydro turbine for higher flow rates. These water turbines represent the PATs that can be installed at the locations of the pressure-reducing valves. The calculation for the water turbine, which is a PAT, is given as follows: 𝑃 ℎ𝑦𝑑 = ŋ ℎ𝑦𝑑 · 𝜌 𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟 ·𝑔· ℎ 𝑛𝑒𝑡 · 𝑄 ˙ 𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑏𝑖𝑛𝑒 (10) where 𝑃 ℎ𝑦𝑑 = hydro turbine power output in kW. ŋ ℎ𝑦𝑑 = efficiency of hydro turbine in %. 𝜌 𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟 = water density, which is 1000 kg/ m 3 . g = acceleration due to gravity 9.81 m/ s 2 . ℎ 𝑛𝑒𝑡 = effective head in m. 𝑄 ˙ 𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑏𝑖𝑛𝑒 = hydro turbine flow rate in m 3 /s . The simulation for all selected valves had the same load and the same renewable energy microgrid system (Figure 8) to better understand the LCOE, NPC, and other economic parameters. Figure 8. Microgrid system for all simulations of PATs and other components. 2.5. Methodology for the Analysis of Results The HOMER model acts as an optimizer for renewable energy systems, offering potential and feasible solutions. It selects the case with the lowest net present cost (NPBC) for a comprehensive analysis. It also performs detailed calculations to evaluate the benefits of incorporating pumps as turbines (PATs) into the microgrid system. The Electrical Analysis component of HOMER provides valuable insight into the role of PATs in power generation. It allows for the power generation of all power systems to be considered. It provides insight into each system’s individual contribution and the lowest electricity cost (LCOE). It also provides insight into grid purchase and recovery values, facilitating analysis of the interplay between each energy component’s power generation and its impact on costs and benefits. Sensitivity analysis is proving to be a valuable tool for understanding the importance and role of a power system within the microgrid system. Manipulating parameters such as the capital cost multiplier or the costs associated with a power system identifies a microgrid system with the lowest NPC, providing important insights for decision-making and optimization (Figure 9). Figure 9. Procedure for analysis of results. The net present cost of the system is all costs of the project incurred during its life and reported at present value. This includes O&M costs, capital costs, and replacement costs. These costs are calculated by HOMER using the discount factor to obtain discounted cash flows. 𝑁𝑃𝐶=𝐶𝑎𝑝𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝐶𝑜𝑠𝑡+𝑅𝑒𝑝𝑙𝑎𝑐𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝐶𝑜𝑠𝑡+𝑂&𝑀 𝐶𝑜𝑠𝑡+𝑔𝑟𝑖𝑑 𝑝𝑢𝑟𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑠𝑒 𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑡−𝑆𝑎𝑙𝑣𝑎𝑔𝑒  (11) Levelized cost of energy production (LCOE) is the ratio of the annual average cost of the project and the total electricity load served. LCOE is an essential economic factor in considering the attraction towards a project. This is calculated using the following equation: 𝐿𝐶𝑂𝐸= 𝐶 𝑎𝑛𝑛,𝑡𝑜𝑡 𝐸 𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑑 (12) where 𝐶 𝑎𝑛𝑛,𝑡𝑜𝑡 = total annualized cost of the system in EUR/year. 𝐸 𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑑 = total electrical energy served in kWh/year. The model uses the nominal interest and inflation rates as inputs to calculate the real discount rate. This is used to calculate the discount factor, which is used to calculate the annualized cost. The calculation for the discount rate is as follows: 𝑖= 𝑖 ′ −𝑓 1+𝑓 (13) where i = real discount rate. 𝑖 ′ = nominal discount rate. f = expected inflation rate. According to the simulation in this research, 𝑖 ′ = 8% and f = 2%, and i can easily be calculated by 𝑖= 0.08−0.02 1+0.02 =0.059 (14) The discount factor is a ratio that can be used to obtain the present value of costs in any year of the project. This factor is used to express, at present value, the savings that will be realized over the project’s life. The discount factor can be calculated using the following equation: 𝑓 𝑑 = 1 (1+𝑖) 𝑁 (15) where 𝑓 𝑑 = discount factor. i = real discount rate. N = number of years. The discount factor in all simulations in this research for the 25th year can be calculated as follows: 𝑓 𝑑 = 1 (1+0.059) 25 =0.238 The renewable energy investment is the NPC of all renewable energy systems installed in the microgrid system. This value is calculated by subtracting the grid purchase cost from the total useful life. This value indicates the actual investment made in renewable energy. 𝑁𝑃𝐶 𝑜𝑓 𝑅𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑤𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒𝑠=𝑁𝑃𝐶 𝑜𝑓 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑗𝑒𝑐𝑡−𝑔𝑟𝑖𝑑 𝑝𝑢𝑟𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑠 (16) The main benefit of installing renewable energy systems is the consumption of locally generated energy. The savings can be determined by calculating the total energy produced by all renewable energy and calculating the bills that would have to be paid if the same energy was consumed from the grid. This value shows the monetary savings from consuming energy without paying bills. The value is calculated by multiplying the grid purchase cost, set at 0.258 kW/h, by the energy generated by the renewable energy sources during the project period. The meaning of this value is derived from calculating the value of net present cost savings. 𝑆𝑎𝑣𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑠 𝑎𝑡 0.258 € kWh grid price ={𝑆𝑜𝑙𝑎𝑟 𝑃𝑉 ( 𝑘𝑊ℎ 𝑦𝑟 )+𝐻𝑦𝑑𝑟𝑜( 𝑘𝑊ℎ 𝑦𝑟 )+𝑊𝑖𝑛𝑑( 𝑘𝑊ℎ 𝑦𝑟 )}×0.258  € kWh ×25 𝑦𝑟 (17) Net present savings is an external calculation created from the software results to highlight the microgrid’s economic advantage and the contribution of PATs. This value is the cost savings over the project’s life, expressed as a present value. This value is calculated by multiplying the cost savings over the project’s life by the discount factor (fd). This value gives an idea of the profits that can be calculated by deducting the savings, i.e., the revenues from the renewable energy NPC. 𝑁𝑒𝑡 𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑆𝑎𝑣𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑠=0.238×𝑆𝑎𝑣𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑠 𝑎𝑡 0.258  € kWh  𝑔𝑟𝑖𝑑 𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒 (18) Net present value (NPV) is the difference between the revenue or savings generated by the project discounted to the current year of consideration. A positive NPV means that the project is attractive. When the project is initiated, the NPV can be calculated as follows: 𝑁𝑃𝑉=𝑁𝑃𝐶−𝑁𝑒𝑡 𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑆𝑎𝑣𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑠 (19) Return on investment (ROI) is an essential factor when considering the investment in a project. It is calculated by dividing the profits by the cost of the project. ROI for the simulation results is calculated externally in this research by calculating the net profit, which is the difference between the renewable energy investment and the net savings. This value is further divided by the renewable energy investment as shown in the equation: 𝑅𝑂𝐼= 𝑁𝑒𝑡 𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝐶𝑜𝑠𝑡 𝑆𝑎𝑣𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑠 (€)−𝑁𝑃𝐶 𝑜𝑓 𝑅𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑤𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒𝑠(€) 𝑁𝑃𝐶 𝑜𝑓 𝑅𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑤𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒𝑠 (€) (20) The costs are entered into the model to calculate the lowest-cost microgrid system. These costs are used to calculate net present costs (NPCs), LCOE, CAPEX, and OPEX. The cost of photovoltaic systems has been decreasing over the years, and the cost of simulating photovoltaic systems includes all equipment, including wiring and labor for installation. The cost of the wind turbine, battery, and inverter are predefined in the software package HOMER. The grid electricity price is set at 0.258 EUR/kWh, and the grid feedback price at 0.030 EUR/kWh. The costs of the different components used are listed in Table 1. Table 1. Costs of various components used in the simulation. 3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Brief system Definition The investigation of energy recovery methods in this study was carried out using a specific framework aimed at controlling water losses. This study was carried out in the municipality of Funchal (CMF), in a pilot area where a comprehensive study on the control of water losses had previously been developed (Figure 10). Figure 10. Funchal municipality (dark blue) and pilot zone (light blue). The municipality’s water supply system benefits from the natural topography and relies on gravity reservoirs that receive water from the Águas e Resíduos da Madeira (ARM) supply system and neighboring municipalities. Given the predominantly residential nature of the region and the high population density, water consumption is remarkably high, requiring an efficient and well-managed system. However, a thorough analysis of the components of water losses based on data provided by the Camara Municipal do Funchal (CMF) revealed the urgent need to implement a strategy focused on reducing actual water losses, representing 90% of total losses in the pilot zone. Furthermore, the total water losses comprised over 60% of the entire amount discharged into the system. This presents a notable financial obstacle to the water utility and poses an ecological danger to its ecosystem. These circumstances emphasize that there is a pressing need to diminish water losses below 20%, as dictated by national protocols. The overarching strategy was developed based on the Institute for Water and Waste Regulation (IRAR) Leakage Control Protocol to address and correct the situation described above. This protocol includes several essential steps, including the following: Establishment of district metered areas (DMAs): This means creating defined zones within the distribution system to facilitate the metering and regulation of pressure levels and flow rates in each area. In the first phase, the primary areas of influence are delineated. Effective pressure management: This step focuses on properly regulating pressure to avoid excessive water loss and ensure adequate water supply to consumers. Active damage control: In this phase, measures are taken to detect and repair leaks in the system in good time. The following subsections provide a comprehensive overview of the current situation and elaborate on the specific procedures used to address this issue. 3.2. Hydraulic Simulations 3.2.1. Hydraulic Scenarios To gain insight into the causes of water loss and determine the most effective loss control strategy, a basic hydraulic model was created using EPANET software. This step proved critical in conducting a diagnostic assessment of current circumstances. It helped inform decision-making regarding establishing district metering areas and intermediate pressure stages. These elements were the initial building blocks for creating the “New Situation” model (see Figure 11). The hydraulic simulation used the Hazen–Williams equation to compute head losses by applying distinct roughness coefficients: values of 140 for recently installed HDPE or cast iron pipelines, 130 for pre-existing HDPE or cast iron pipes, 120 for steel or PVC pipes, and, lastly, 100 was used for fiber and galvanized metal pipe material. Figure 11. Selected PRV for PAT implementation. In an initial review of the hydraulically constructed model, we found specific deficiencies in the hierarchical structure of the network. In addition, the evaluation showed that the pressure drops in the network were relatively low, which could lead to increased water pressure and consequently to the risk of fractures and leaks. This problem is visually represented in Figure 12a, where areas exceeding the legal maximum pressure of 60 m of water column (m w.c.) are highlighted in yellow. Consumption requirements in the intersections are shown in Figure 12b. Figure 12. EPANET model—pressure levels in network junctions (a) and consumption demand on network junctions (b). The EPANET model developed has proven invaluable in providing crucial insights into the pressure dynamics of the water network. On average, the pressure is about 53 m w.c. and occasionally rises to about 100 m w.c. The developed model corresponds to the current situation and includes all previously defined mitigation measures, such as implementing newly installed PRVs and establishing new DMAs. Figure 13 shows the EPANET model, which shows the network nodes’ pressure levels and consumption demand. Figure 13. The current situation is spatial pressure distribution at 13:00 (a) and a percentage of less than a particular pressure value (b). The hydraulic simulator model was significantly improved as part of the new improved scenario. This included the creation of 30 new district metered areas (DMAs) with an average extent of 6 km each. In addition, 50 new pressure-reducing valves (PRVs) were added to the model to provide additional pressure levels. In addition, certain existing valves were adjusted, i.e., both opened and closed, and approximately 11 km of new piping was added to the network. These measures enabled a more uniform pressure distribution, resulting in lower average and maximum pressure values (Figure 14). Figure 14. New situation spatial pressure distribution at 13:00 (a) and percentage of less than a particular pressure value (b). After simulating this revised scenario, a brief analysis of the results revealed several noteworthy findings: (i) The pressure values of the network decreased to an average value of about 37 m w.c., which is a decrease of 16 m w.c. compared to the previous scenario. (ii) Only 4% of the nodes in the network registered a minimum pressure above the legal maximum of 60 m w.c.—a significant decrease (35%) from the previous scenario. Moreover, this figure increased slightly to 5% when studied under static boundary conditions, in stark contrast to the 50% recorded in the existing scenario. (iii) It is particularly noteworthy that most of the network is no longer under excessive pressure, with an average reduction of about 1.6 bar compared to the current situation. These results underscore that the excessive pressure from sectorization efforts has been significantly alleviated. In the new scenario, the proportion of the network exposed to high pressure decreased significantly, and pressure fluctuations decreased noticeably. To illustrate, in the current model, 40% of the network nodes were exposed to pressures above 60 m w.c. In the new model, this number increased to almost 6%. In addition, it is essential to highlight the establishment of new district metered areas (DMAs) and the introduction of additional pressure-reducing valves (PRVs). In addition, the existing pressure-reducing valves with different pressure drops were fine-tuned, and flow meters were strategically placed in front of these valves. These measures were implemented to recalibrate the pressure in the network and exert better control over flow dynamics. Overall, these improvements reduced water losses and lowered the probability of system breaks in the distribution network. 3.2.2. PRV and PAT Characteristics Without data on PRV prices, a correlation between valve diameter and price is assumed based on multiple valves from a particular manufacturer (Tecnilab). The estimated cost of PRVs was derived from available average market prices (Table 2). These costs are comparable to the costs of PATs. Recent studies [43] show a cost comparison of four different PAT options: a radial pump with one, two, or three pairs of magnetic poles (pp) and a vertical multistage pump with one pair of magnetic poles. The radial pumps (the most commonly used) have similar costs and are less expensive than vertical multistage pumps. The vertical pumps are more efficient for a more extensive flow range. Table 2. PRV price *. For the PAT application, the price for each PAT is determined based on the maximum power of each device. The price varies with the maximum power generated by each PAT: the greater the installed power, the lower the unit cost (Figure 15). Figure 15. Proposed PAT unit cost vs. power based on several machines. Despite the availability of numerous potential sites for energy recovery based on the location of PRVs, only ten pressure-reducing valves (PRVs) were selected for pump-as-turbine (PAT) installation (Table 3). This selection was deemed sufficient to gather the necessary data to evaluate the energy recovery potential of the network in small communities with local power generation. The selection process included a preliminary assessment of each PRV’s suitability for PAT implementation. Specifically, the pressure drop provided for each PRV was multiplied by its flow rate. Then, the 10 PRVs with the highest values, represented as QH (flow rate multiplied by pressure drop), were selected for subsequent in-depth analysis. Table 3. PRVs selected for PAT implementation. Some options have been defined. The results of the optimal fixed ER energy for each PRV site, along with the respective optimal PAT selection and rotation speed, are shown in Table 4. Note that the NR mode does not correspond to each PAT’s optimal energy recovery scenario. Table 4 shows the selected PAT type, optimal fixed rotation speed, and energy production. Table 4. Type of PAT for optimal fixed rotation speed and energy production. A careful examination of Table 4 reveals a discernible correlation between the power generated and the pump as turbine (PAT) speed. This relationship is likely a result of the typically higher flow rates in pressure-reducing valves (PRVs) with greater energy output, which require higher speeds for the PATs to achieve their optimum energy recovery capability. However, an exception to this trend is PAT 100–200 in PRV TR08B, which produces three times the power compared to PAT 65–250 in PRV SM04.5B, although it has a lower speed. This discrepancy can be attributed to the broader characteristic curve of PAT 100–200 at the rated speed, which affects the optimum speed. Another crucial aspect is the relationship between the maximum energy generated and the appropriate PAT selection for each scenario. While PAT 100–200 proves optimal for PRV TR08B, PRV MP02.5A-1 provides the highest energy yield when paired with PAT 65–200. This phenomenon underscores that higher energy production is often associated with higher discharge rates and head, which typically requires larger turbomachinery to maximize energy recovery potential. 3.3. HOMER Simulation The simulations conducted as part of HOMER provide valuable insight into the economics and power generation within the microgrid. These simulations illuminate the central role that pumps as turbines (PATs) play in the economic dynamics of the project. The methodology includes the definition of various economic terms. It presents results demonstrating the cost benefits of incorporating PATs into microgrids. The optimization process of the software revolves around meeting electricity demand through the judicious use of energy systems and available resources. The simulations consider different flow values with an underlying constraint on grid purchases that aims to limit CO2 emissions to 10,000 kg/year. The results of these simulations highlight the importance of hydropower through PATs in reducing costs and increasing profits in a relatively short time frame. It is worth noting that the TR08B valve has the highest net present value (NPV) and economic benefit, primarily due to a higher flow rate. Conversely, the lowest NPV was observed for valve TR06.5B. In addition, hydropower, represented by PATs, has the lowest LCOE compared to all other energy systems considered in all scenarios studied. Table 5 summarizes the economic benefits using metrics such as return on investment (ROI) and net present value to consolidate the economic aspects. Table 6 summarizes the technical results of all scenarios to provide a comprehensive overview. Table 5. Brief simulation results after optimization with HOMER for different valves and a lifetime of 25 Years. Table 6. Contribution of all energy systems in the microgrid and electrical specifications. Using power generation from water distribution networks and exploring small-scale hydropower generation opportunities are new technologies that contrast with established large-scale hydropower facilities. The resulting findings relate to the economics of the proposed project. Determination of renewable resource investment, grid price savings, net savings (NPS), and net present value (NPV) was performed externally following the equations presented in the Methodology section. Table 5 shows a consistent positive NPV for all project scenarios where PATs replace or are coupled with existing NPVs, depending on the pressure control required. This indicates that the project delivers favorable outcomes and is an enticing investment opportunity. It can be seen that an increased contribution of hydropower or an increased value of QH leads to a corresponding increase in NPV, highlighting the direct correlation between hydropower production and the NPV of the project, as visually illustrated in Figure 16. Figure 16. NPV vs. QH for all the valves replaced with PATs in the microgrid. The most important source of savings and benefits is in avoiding the purchase of grid electricity. Solar photovoltaic (PV) systems are limited to daylight hours. At the same time, small-scale wind energy has variable power output, reducing reliability. Hydroelectric PATs can generate power throughout the day, which is consistent with the constant demand for water. Most importantly, the higher flow rates (QH) associated with PATs, such as the TR08B valve, contribute to their cost-effectiveness, as shown in the LCOE data in Table 6. These versatile PAT devices are used in various contexts, including small watercourses, water treatment plants, distribution networks, and more. The favorable LCOE profile of PATs results in significant cost benefits, especially when integrated into municipal networks with the necessary engineering considerations. This integration can lead to lower energy costs for consumers. In addition, PATs play a central role in smart cities, particularly in response to the increasing demand for electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure. Given the rise in summer tourism associated with high water demand, off-grid technologies using PATs offer a significant advantage in relieving the strain on the power grid associated with EV charging. Using PATs can potentially reduce the cost of electric vehicle charging, which benefits a broader consumer base.

SM04.5B: Identifies the valve with a flow value approximately equal to the average flow of all valves. TR08B: Designates the valve with the highest flow value. These three scenarios provide insight into how the model responds when integrating different energy systems. The main objective of the model is to optimize the microgrid system to achieve the most cost-effective configuration while ensuring that energy needs are met. This optimization strategy, known as “load tracking”, prioritizes the satisfaction of load demand. Table 7 lists the codes for each energy component. Figure 17a–c graphically illustrate the power generation required to meet the different load demands for the various microgrid configurations defined in these cases. Figure 17. Electricity production with different components of the microgrid for the valves: (a) MP-02.5A-1, (b) SM04.5B, (c) TR08B. Table 7. Energy system code identification. All energy systems are integrated into the microgrid system with the valve MP-02.5A-1 to cover the energy demand. On the other hand, in the case of valve SM04.5B with a flow rate of 43.12 L/s, the wind turbine is excluded from the configuration due to the higher energy production of the PAT’s hydro power, which has a more favorable LCOE. In particular, in the case of valve TR08B, with a flow rate of 152.41 L/s, only the PAT (hydro power) is used since it is sufficient to meet the power demand without additional power systems. The grid is used in all cases, as there is a possibility to export surplus electricity to the grid as well. The transition from excluding high-cost energy systems at the lowest flow value of hydropower to using PATs exclusively at the highest flow value underscores the importance of PATs as a cost-effective solution for small communities. Figure 18a–c visually represent the power consumption within the microgrid energy system. These figures illustrate the operation of the microgrid system and the energy output of all the energy systems to meet the energy demand. The grid draws decrease as the water capacity increases. In the case of TR08B (Case 3), not only is the demand met, but excess energy is also generated, resulting in a negative net cost. The main objective of a microgrid is to reduce costs while ensuring continuous load demand coverage. Figure 18. Meeting load demand with all the energy systems of the microgrid for the valves: (a) MP-02.5A-1, (b) SM04.5B, and (c) TR08B. A sensitivity analysis was performed for the three selected cases to evaluate the variation in power system configurations. Figure 19a–c illustrate the optimal cost-effective solutions with varying capital costs for solar PV and a constant capital cost of 0.3 for the wind turbine. Notably, the wind turbine has the highest LCOE compared to the other power systems. The variations in grid purchase price were between 0.1 EUR/kWh and 0.5 EUR/kWh. Figure 19. Sensitivity analysis with wind turbine capital cost multiplier of 0.3 for the valve: (a) MP-02.5A-1, (b) SM04.5B, (c) TR08B. Considering all these variables, we see that hydropower remains a consistent component across all sensitivity cases, underscoring the indispensability of the pump as a turbine (PAT), even given the cost variations in solar PV, grid, and wind turbine. In the baseline case with the MP-02.5A-1 valve, a significant portion of the sensitivity spectrum is covered by the optimal combination of solar PV, wind turbine, hydropower, and grid. However, this dominance decreases in the case of valve SM04.5B, where the flow rate of the turbine is higher. This increase in flow rate leads to higher electricity generation from PATs, which have the lowest LCOE. Remarkably, the last case uses only hydropower, which consistently results in negative net cost (NPC). This is due to the sufficient hydropower generation that not only meets the load demand but also generates a surplus of electricity that exceeds the installation cost due to the revenue from grid recovery. The sensitivity analysis, which includes variations in photovoltaic, wind turbine, and grid purchase costs within the specified range, consistently emphasizes the need to include hydropower in all conceivable energy systems to achieve the lowest NPC for meeting load demand. Through this sensitivity analysis, it can be conclusively stated that PATs are a cost-effective approach to small-scale renewable energy. It is essential to note that this study is based on estimated averages for the different seasons. In addition, the limitations of HOMER, which restrict the inclusion of multiple hydro turbines, mean that this study cannot explore the full potential of multiple PATs within a microgrid system. Nonetheless, alternative tools can be used to explore the full integration of PATs in such systems. In summary, all of the simulations of HOMER in the various cases and scenarios aimed to satisfy electricity demand through selected small energy community systems, and while these systems may vary depending on the load size, hydropower remains a central component for cost-effective power generation throughout. This research paves the way for future studies in smart cities and in various small energy communities (i.e., topographic features, flow and drop heights, solar radiation and wind availability, and type of turbines) where sophisticated systems can be deployed to harness energy from PATs for integration into the microgrid. These future studies could also include demand forecasting based on weather patterns and components that influence electricity prices and promise economic benefits and opportunities in distributed renewable generation. 4. Conclusions The world’s water supply systems face high energy consumption and water loss due to poor management and inadequate water utility practices. Frequent breaks and leaks in these networks are associated with inadequate water pressure regulation, which reduces system efficiency and increases demand for water and energy. This mismanagement strains water and energy resources, which are critical in today’s society and environmental context, especially with the increasing threat of climate change and population growth exacerbating water scarcity. Addressing water losses and energy inefficiencies is essential for sustainable development without compromising the quality of life of future generations. A new optimized method is proposed to achieve the following: - Integrate micro-hydropower plants into water distribution systems, creating hybrid energy solutions. - Replace or add pressure control valves with PATs, allowing for clean power generation while maintaining pressure levels within certain limits. - Apply a real case study for an alternative solution, using the Funchal water network as an ideal case study for implementing this energy recovery method. - Demonstrate suitable locations for pressure-reducing valves (PRVs) and for the implementation of PATs. - A comprehensive analysis of the system’s operation to evaluate the economic feasibility of the investment. A simulation model for hydraulics developed by EPA, USA (EPANET), and for energy systems developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in the USA (HOMER Pro) were used. This study uses the model to analyze the economic benefits of using pumps as turbines (PATs) for small-scale power generation and to gain insights into how microgrids can meet energy demand with PATs. Sensitivity analysis is performed to evaluate the variability of the microgrid system in response to variations in the cost of its energy components. The economic analysis shows favorable results for integrating PATs with a positive net present value (NPV). The highest NPV was obtained for the TR08B valve with a maximum flow rate of 152.41 L/s. The grid-connected microgrid system includes PV solar, wind turbines, and hydropower. The sensitivity analysis results consistently show the economic viability of PATs under different scenarios, even when the costs of PV, wind turbines, and grid infrastructure are reduced. In all simulation cases, PATs have the lowest electricity (LCOE) cost compared to other energy systems, confirming their economic feasibility and efficiency. Based on the comprehensive methodology developed, it is clear that pumps as turbines (PATs) occupy a central role in cost-effective small-scale power generation. Consequently, many PATs have emerged as alternatives to conventional turbines due to their cost-effectiveness, accessibility, and reasonable efficiency. To evaluate the feasibility of this technology, the water distribution system in Funchal, Portugal served as a case study for implementing several PATs in conjunction with pressure-reducing valves (PRVs) at sites with significant energy recovery potential. The following are the main conclusions from this part: i. Variable-speed electrical regulation (ER) is preferable to a fixed-speed ER because it provides slightly higher performance for the exact equipment cost. ii. The “no regulation” mode (NR) is an unsuitable investment because it cannot adapt to fluctuating flow conditions, resulting in limited energy output. iii. Of the 50 newly implemented PRVs in Funchal’s water distribution system, only 10 PRVs were deemed viable for PAT. These PRVs together generate 406 MWh/year of energy, with a combined net present value. Hydraulic analysis shows significant potential for hydroelectric generation, especially in small communities where favorable topographic conditions for power generation in inclined grids lead to promising economic and energy results. This also contributes to positive environmental impacts by promoting the sustainability of water distribution. In energy analysis, the HOMER model, used by professionals in over 150 countries for microgrid projects, provides optimized solutions that achieve the lowest net present cost (NPC) while meeting load demand. The main objective of using this model in research is to highlight the importance of PATs in achieving economic benefits from small-scale power generation. Key findings from this part of the analysis include the following: i. Various PRVs were identified, and simulations were performed for each local system without changing the load and other power system specifications, such as capital, O&M, and replacement costs. ii. All simulations for all valves resulted in positive net present values, and additional analyses were performed to understand the nature of the economic benefits resulting from increased electricity generation from micro-hydro using PATs. iii. PV solar and micro-wind turbines installed in small DMAs in Funchal’s water distribution system produce 153 MWh/year and 55 MWh/year, respectively, adding to the 406 MWh/year generated by PATs. This adds up to 615 MWh/year at the ten selected PRV sites within Funchal’s water network alone. In addition, the sensitivity analysis shows that the inclusion of PATs remains a cost-effective solution for various scenarios with capital cost multipliers for solar PV, wind, and grid purchase costs. This methodology currently considers the inclusion of a hydro turbine for the simulations. Future research incorporating multiple PATs will provide deeper insights into the different types of microgrid behavior in smart cities and communities. The integration of the micro-hydropower systems could contribute with other clean energy systems to achieve having zero non-renewable resources in the water cycle.

Abstract This study aimed to assess the environmental effectiveness of vineyards utilising on-site weather stations integrated with a decision support system (DSS), and to identify the critical hotspots in smart farms that have already obtained integrated or organic certification. For this purpose, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology was applied. The research comprised three smart farms employing on-site weather stations and a traditional farm without advanced technologies, which served as a benchmark. The analysis revealed variations in environmental footprints driven by differences in farm management practices and soil characteristics. The results highlighted that smart farms, in compliance with integrated or organic certifications, focus on reducing inputs such as agrochemicals or water consumption. However, these reductions could shift the environmental burden to other impacts, such as those related to machinery use, which remained the most critical aspect across all vineyards considered. In some smart farms, critical issues involve other aspects, such as irrigation and fertilisation. The lack of awareness about the potential environmental impacts of the adopted technical options could make smart farms more impactful than traditional farms. Interestingly, this study found that solely implementing advanced technologies could fall short of achieving ecological objectives. This study emphasises the significance of utilising LCA as a valuable tool to support farmers in making informed decisions while adopting technological strategies to achieve environmentally sustainable goals.

Introduction The negative environmental impact of agriculture is an old issue that remains a serious concern because it is responsible for 29 % of the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and utilises 70 % of all available freshwater (Rinaldi et al., 2016). Population growth and the consequent demand for food, as well as climate change, which puts the quality and amount of food available at risk (Alexandratos and Bruinsma, 2012; Maja and Ayano, 2021; Molotoks et al., 2021; Turi et al., 2014), could increase the environmental impacts of the agri-food sector. In this regard, the European Union, as part of “The European Green Deal” (EC, 2019), has introduced the “Farm to Fork Strategy”, aimed at creating a fairer, healthier and more environmentally friendly agri-food sector (EC, European Commission, 2020). Therefore, ecological transitions have become a priority for agricultural systems. In addition, the wine sector has become aware of the significant environmental impact of its activities. The effects of conventional viticulture on soil degradation and surface water pollution due to the intensive use and production of synthetic fertilisers and pesticides (Rugani et al., 2013; Villanueva-Rey et al., 2014), air pollution resulting from greenhouse gases and other emissions generated by agricultural machinery (Balafoutis et al., 2017; Renaud-Gentié et al., 2020), and excessive land and water consumption (Christ and Burritt, 2013) have also been demonstrated. Therefore, the need to measure the environmental sustainability of wine chains has increased in recent years. In this regard, different indicators and methods have been proposed and implemented, such as carbon and/or water footprints (Bonamente et al., 2016; Bosco et al., 2011; D'Ammaro et al., 2021a; Marras et al., 2015; Miglietta et al., 2018; Rinaldi et al., 2016; Rugani et al., 2013; Vázquez-Rowe et al., 2013), a set of indicators defined in the program VIVA established by the Italian Ministry of the Environment to promote the sustainability of the Italian wine sector (Borsato et al., 2020; D'Ammaro et al., 2021b; Lamastra et al., 2016), and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) (Casson et al., 2022; Fusi et al., 2014; Gazulla et al., 2010; Harb et al., 2021; Jourdaine et al., 2020; Masotti et al., 2022; Pattara et al., 2012; Roselli et al., 2020; Villanueva-Rey et al., 2014). The wine sector was the first to experience a significant ecologically oriented transformation, as the reputation of wine, more than that of other products, was closely tied to its origin and the climatic conditions of the relevant territories (terroir). Hence, operators consider climate change a deeply concerning issue, given its worldwide influence on wine production (Ollat et al., 2016; Santos et al., 2020). The environmentally sound turn is also dictated by increasing pressure from customers, whose purchasing choices tend to increasingly favour farms sensitive to environmental issues (Vecchio et al., 2023). Another reason that makes the ecological transition the right way for wine operators is the opportunity to expand their businesses by entering food and wine tourism. Garibaldi (2023) highlights that cellars and vineyards are the most interesting tourist places, as shown by numerous Italian vineyards being part of wine tourism itineraries. In addition, in the Sardinian region, which is considered a good destination for any wine enthusiasm, tourism is a profitable business for farms involved that generates 7–10 % of their turnover. As sustainability is a driver of choice for travellers attracted by these experiences, winegrowers interested in joining these tourist circuits must demonstrate their commitment to environmental protection by investing in ecological certifications and innovative technologies aimed at reducing the impact of their activities on the environment (Festa et al., 2023). The transition from conventional to integrated, organic, or biodynamic farming is considered an appropriate approach to reduce the negative impacts of viticulture (Borsato et al., 2020; Masotti et al., 2022; Notarnicola et al., 2017; Renaud-Gentié et al., 2020; Rouault et al., 2016; Volanti et al., 2022). In this regard, the European standards for integrated and organic agriculture principally focus on reducing synthetic fertilisers and pesticides but do not consider other aspects, such as GHG emissions. Accordingly, organic farms may not necessarily have better environmental performance than conventional farms (Renaud-Gentié et al., 2020; Rouault et al., 2016; Rugani et al., 2013; Venkat, 2012). Thus, other strategies are needed to fully achieve environmental sustainability. Smart technologies are considered a very promising solution for achieving environmental and economic efficiency in agricultural activities (Lieder and Schröter-Schlaack, 2021). As a result, a shift towards “smart farming” methods is taking place. The implementation of new technologies, such as global positioning systems (GPS) (Balafoutis et al., 2017), satellite and airborne remote sensing (Sassu et al., 2021), geographic information systems (GIS) (Ozdemir et al., 2017), robotics (Pradel et al., 2022), Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, drones, and artificial intelligence (Dantas et al., 2021; Drath and Horch, 2014), has enabled farmers to monitor field conditions and make strategic decisions for the whole farm or even a single plant (Khan et al., 2022; Martinho and Guine, 2021). Considering that successful farming depends on the monitoring of meteorological conditions, the application of wireless sensor networks (WSN), frameworks, and IoT platforms to detect various parameters such as soil temperature and moisture, air temperature and humidity, rainfall, and wind conditions has rapidly increased (Ebiesuwa et al., 2022; Nachankar et al., 2018; Prabu et al., 2021). These IoT-enabled networks can automate numerous farm activities through decision support systems (DSS) (Rinaldi and He, 2014). Therefore, in agriculture, it is becoming more common to use on-site weather stations integrated with a DSS, which allows growers to make well-informed decisions on several aspects of vineyard management, such as disease and pest control, irrigation scheduling, alerts on potential hazards such as freezing or hailstorms, control of the growth phase of grapevines, and grape ripening. Some studies have shown that the introduction of innovative technologies benefits farms by maximising yields and reducing impacts (Balafoutis et al., 2017; Canaj et al., 2021; Casson et al., 2022; Del Borghi et al., 2022; Núñez-Cárdenas et al., 2022). However, there are certain exceptions. Pradel et al. (2022) highlighted an overall increase in the environmental impact of a vineyard when weeding was carried out with robots rather than in a conventional manner. In addition, the use of technologies to reduce a given impact may increase the occurrence of different environmental harms (trade-offs). For example, in Australian vineyards, the reduction in water use achieved through the conversion from flood to drip irrigation increased GHG emissions owing to the increased energy consumption for water pressurisation (Longbottom and Petrie, 2015). Therefore, a multi-criteria assessment from the perspective of the life cycle stages of a product should be appropriate for exploiting all the environmental benefits offered by innovation, especially when the operations responsible for negative impacts are diverse, as in viticulture. Indeed, Bosco et al. (2011) and Vázquez-Rowe et al. (2012), in Italian and Spanish vineyards, respectively, indicated that fertiliser and pesticide production were the primary processes involved in global warming, whereas Rouault et al. (2016) and Balafoutis et al. (2017) observed that field energy was the leading cause of GHG emissions for French and Greek vineyards, respectively. The implementation of LCA has the potential to address these challenges and aid in the decision-making process for adopting technological solutions that optimise resource utilisation and minimise the environmental impact of crop production (Balafoutis et al., 2017; Canaj et al., 2021; Del Borghi et al., 2022; Núñez-Cárdenas et al., 2022; Pradel et al., 2022). This methodology, based on international standards (ISO, 2006), is widely used to assess environmental impacts and improve the environmental performance of goods and services throughout their life cycles (Finnveden et al., 2009; Guinée, 2002; Tukker, 2000). It has also found various applications in the agricultural sector (Arzoumanidis et al., 2017; Notarnicola et al., 2017). In viticulture, LCA has primarily been employed to compare organic, biodynamic, and conventional farming methods (Masotti et al., 2022; Rouault et al., 2016; Rugani et al., 2013; Sinisterra-Solís et al., 2020; Villanueva-Rey et al., 2014; Volanti et al., 2022), and as an eco-design tool to evaluate the potential impact of precision agricultural strategies on vineyards (Rouault et al., 2020; Tziolas et al., 2023). Few studies have focused on utilising LCA to evaluate the environmental impacts of vineyards using advanced technologies (Balafoutis et al., 2017; Casson et al., 2022; Pradel et al., 2022), highlighting that awareness of the impacts linked to the farm management techniques adopted is fundamental to leverage all the benefits derived from the implementation of smart technologies. Therefore, it may be difficult to assert that smart farms have better environmental performance than traditional farms without this knowledge. Further studies are needed to deepen the knowledge of the opportunities offered to smart farms using the LCA methodology to highlight the environmental criticalities due to farm management and to obtain data on which to make informed choices to improve their environmental performance. This approach allows the benefits accrued from smart technologies to be exploited. Considering the usefulness of on-site weather stations integrated with DSS in vineyards, this study involved three smart farms employing this technology and, as a benchmark, a farm that did not utilise advanced technologies, with the following main objectives: 1) Identifying critical hotspots from an environmental perspective that may persist in smart farms using remotely controlled on-site weather stations operating in the same geographical area under the same meteorological conditions that have already indicated their commitment to environmental protection through certification. 2) testing the hypothesis that employing smart technologies alone enables farms to achieve environmental sustainability objectives fully. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Case studies LCA studies on vineyards in Northern Sardinia (Italy) were conducted using data from the year 2021. Three smart farms (Asm, Bsm and Csm) equipped with on-site weather stations including multiple sensor devices which could monitor wind speed, wind direction, air temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, solar radiation, air pressure, light, soil moisture, and leaf wetness were selected. The data acquired through the WSN are automatically sent to the cloud and readable by a smartphone so that the operator can monitor the trends of the parameters of interest, make quick decisions, and act effectively. Agronomic technicians supervised the selected vineyards to obtain reliable information and data. As a benchmark for smart farms, a traditional farm (Dtr) was considered, which did not use any technological devices to acquire information on weather forecasts and soil conditions but relied entirely on the multi-year experience of an agronomist and the regional meteorological service. The farms involved, whose characteristics are detailed in Table 1, were located in a limited geographical area characterised by a Mediterranean climate, with mild winters and hot, sunny summers tempered by sea breezes. The average values of temperature, humidity, and rainfall registered by the on-site weather stations owned by the farms during the grape growth cycle are listed in Table 1. The farms involved follow the path of sustainability guaranteed by environmental certification. Specifically, three farms obtained the SQNPI (Sistema di Qualità Nazionale di Produzione Integrata - National Quality System of Integrated Production) certification, established in Italy by Decree Law No. 4 (2011). This certification is granted to agricultural and agro-industrial production methods which comply with the technical standard of integrated production, an agri-food production system that uses production techniques aimed at minimising the use of synthetic chemicals and rationalising fertilisation in compliance with ecological, economic, and toxicological criteria. One of the farms (Csm) obtained the organic certification in compliance with the EU Regulation 2018/848. The farms involved in this study had areas ranging from approximately 3 ha to 40 ha, yielding 3400–10,000 kg/ha of grapes. The production almost exclusively concerns grapes for certified Controlled and Guaranteed Denomination of Origin (DOCG), Controlled Denomination of Origin (DOC), and Typical Geographical Indication (IGT) wines. The production protocols for these certifications provide guidelines for grape cultivation techniques and yield limits. “Vermentino” is the predominantly grown grape cultivar in the farms involved; however, winegrowers manage all varieties cultivated under the same management schemes. The differences between farms were related to the soil texture, which ranged from predominantly sandy to mostly clayey, as well as the type of soil operations and the number of repetitions of each practice per year (Table 1). Fertilisation techniques range from fertigation and foliar fertilisation to buried fertilisation. Regarding irrigation, all farms adopted the drip irrigation system, with a variable (Farm Asm and Farm Bsm) or uniform rate (Farm Dtr). Unlike the others, Farm Csm did not include an irrigation phase. To identify the production steps that most influenced the environmental performance of each farm, the contributions to the various impact categories from soil operations (accounting for those linked to tillage, weed, and grass management), irrigation, fertilisation, and plant protection treatments were considered separately (Table 3). Regarding the phases related to fertilisation and plant protection treatments, the contributions to the considered impact categories of input products (manufacturing and use), diesel consumption for the use of machinery for spreading products, transport of products from the selling point to the farm, and product packaging were analysed in detail (Table 4).

LCA 2.2.1. Goal and scope definition This study aimed to evaluate the environmental performance of grapes from vineyards operating under the same climatic conditions and employing on-site weather stations and identify the aspects related to the different farm management techniques that significantly influence their environmental footprint. The functional unit (FU) chosen for this study was 1 kg of grapes produced; an FU based on mass was considered more suitable when only upstream processes were considered (Pizzigallo et al., 2008; Zambelli et al., 2023). Modelling was performed using SimaPro software (ver. 9.1.1.1) (PRé-sustainability, 2023). A “from cradle to farm gate” approach was adopted (Fig. 1), i.e., from the production of raw materials to obtaining grapes. The vineyard planting stage and explantation stage were excluded from the analysis to avoid additional uncertainties from data with poor accuracy provided by the farms. Gazulla et al. (2010) excluded these stages by considering the long average lifespan (30–70 years) of vineyards. Replacement of dead or damaged vines was a usual activity carried out during the year. Therefore, the impacts of this activity were included in grape production. In general, these stages are included when analysing impacts related to transitioning from one agricultural technique to another (Falcone et al., 2016; Ferrara and De Feo, 2018). The soil operations considered for each farm are listed in Table 1. All inputs (water, fuel, energy, fertilisers, and pesticides) and output flows (emissions into the air, water, soil, and waste) were considered for each agricultural stage or activity within the defined boundaries (Fig. 1). These data refer to the year 2021. Given the seasonal variability of crops and microclimatic conditions, which could also imply variability in the characteristics of agricultural practices (Ferrara and De Feo, 2018), it is advisable to use average data over three or more years (Borsato et al., 2020; Harb et al., 2021). However, referring to a single year is typical (Gazulla et al., 2010; Harb et al., 2021; Laca et al., 2021; Russo et al., 2021) because of the difficulty of conducting data collection over multiple years.

Facilities and equipment used to manufacture farm tools and machinery, as well as products and infrastructure related to employees' needs, were excluded (Pradel et al., 2022). Waste produced by employees during field operations, such as disposable masks, gloves, boots, and overalls, was not considered as their quantity, in terms of mass, did not exceed 1 % of the total. Vineyard stakes were excluded from the study because they were in the planting stage (Fusi et al., 2014). Finally, the wires for tying the shoots were not considered, as it was difficult to quantify all the manufacturing materials used, as they were made of mixed materials (e.g. rubber, plastic, iron, and natural twine). Regarding the multifunctionality issue, the following choices were made: Farm Dtr-practiced fertigation integrates fertilisation into an irrigation system. The fertigation equipment was powered using a diesel generator. Thus, the allocation of diesel consumption between fertilisation and irrigation processes is required. The allocation could have been carried out considering the diesel needed to pump water for irrigation only and for fertilisation (Casson et al., 2022). Because such data were not available, we opted for an allocation criterion based on the mass (of water and fertiliser, respectively). In addition to being the most widespread allocation criterion, it also expresses a causal relationship between the flow to be allocated (amount of diesel consumed) and the functions provided (amount of water and fertiliser, respectively), as recommended by ISO 14044 (ISO, 2006). Therefore, based on the mass of water and fertiliser used in fertigation by Farm Dtr in the reference year, 1/6 of the diesel consumption for fertigation was allocated to the fertilisation phase, and the remaining 5/6 was allocated to irrigation. 2.2.2. Life cycle inventory The input data collection (Table 2), initially conducted using a questionnaire to obtain the primary data, was subsequently completed and expanded through several direct interviews with the farms' reference technicians. Pesticide emissions in the three areas (air, water, and soil) were computed using the environmental distribution suggested by Mackay's model (level I) (Mackay and Paterson, 1981). Considering this distribution, substances for which data were not found were computed according to the Product Environmental Footprint (PEF) guidelines developed by the Joint Research Centre (JRC), which assume that 90 % of the substance is emitted into the agricultural soil compartment, 9 % into the air, and 1 % into the water (Zampori and Pant, 2019). The JRC guidelines, which propose specific emission factors for the main fertilising substances, were also considered for fertiliser emissions (Zampori and Pant, 2019). Secondary data were obtained from the Ecoinvent database (Ecoinvent database 3.5, 2018) and the Agri-Footprint database (Agri-Footprint 5.0, 2019); specifically, the collated data pertained to fuel, electricity, raw material production, transportation, and waste treatment.

Life cycle impact assessment The CML-2001 baseline V3.06/EU25 LCIA method was used for the impact assessment phase as it is the most widely used assessment method in this context (Ferrara and De Feo, 2018). The impact categories considered were abiotic depletion (elements and ultimate reserves) (AD), abiotic depletion (fossil fuels) (ADff), global warming (GW), ozone layer depletion (OLD), human toxicity (HT), photochemical oxidation (PO), acidification (AF), eutrophication (EP), freshwater aquatic ecotoxicity (FAE), marine aquatic ecotoxicity (MAE), and terrestrial ecotoxicity (TE). Normalisation, which is an optional step in the LCAs, was also performed. For normalisation, the absolute impact indicators for the various impact categories are compared to reference scores – the so-called “normalisation factors” (NFs) – describing the impacts associated with a reference system, e.g. a region (Sala et al., 2017; D'Ammaro et al., 2021b), to obtain dimensionless indices. Therefore, normalisation allows comparisons between impact categories by expressing them on a common scale. In this study, the NFs were based on the total impacts for the EU 25 area, according to the CML2001 method. 3. Results and discussion The characterisation results for the environmental footprint of each farm are shown in Table 3. The relative contribution of the vineyards to each impact category, presented in Fig. 2, highlighted that the smart organic farm (Csm) contributed to eight impact categories out of 11 impact categories more than the other farms. These results are in agreement with those of previous studies (Renaud-Gentié et al., 2020; Rouault et al., 2016; Rugani et al., 2013; Venkat, 2012), highlighting that organic farms may have worse environmental effects than conventional farms. It should be noted that the impacts of the traditional Farm Dtr were similar or sometimes even lower than those of the smart farms, except for FAE, which had the greatest contribution by far. However, to identify the environmental criticalities and better understand which phases of production most affected the performance of each farm, an analysis of the contributions to the impact categories from soil operations (detailed for each farm in Table 1), irrigation, fertilisation, and plant protection treatments was conducted (Table 3). The analysis of the life cycle stages, presented in Fig. 3, shows that in Farms Bsm, Csm, and Dtr, soil operations made the greatest contribution to most of the impact categories. In contrast, irrigation, particularly the related electricity consumption, has the greatest impact in Farm Asm. Fertilisation in Farms Asm and Bsm and the use of pesticides in Farms Csm and Dtr had the second-greatest impact. Therefore, in line with Lamastra et al. (2016), pesticides and fertilisers did not have the most relevant effects at the vineyards considered. Criticalities persisting in the life cycle stages of smart farms are analysed and discussed in the following sections. Moreover, a comparison with the literature was made considering that grape production is heterogeneous, making comparisons with other studies difficult owing to different choices regarding FU, system boundaries, and other assumptions (Letamendi et al., 2022).

Fuel consumption and impact of soil operations Considerable differences were observed among the smart farms with regard to fuel consumption (Table 2). Organic Farm Csm had the highest diesel consumption (75 g/kg), which was approximately double that of Farm Bsm and approximately six times that of Farm Asm. The fuel consumption of Farm Csm was similar to that of Farm Dtr. Comparison of diesel consumption of the vineyards involved in this study with the other vineyards located in Sardinia. Indeed, the diesel consumption (105.6 g/kg) reported by Marras et al. (2015) was two to nine times higher than that of the farms considered in this study. On the contrary, in the Sardinian vineyard analysed by Benedetto (2013) and Fusi et al. (2014) (after converting into g/kg the data originally referring to 1 0.75-L bottle of wine as a FU, corresponding to 1.1 kg of grape), the consumption of diesel (around 11 g/kg) was similar to that of Farm Asm, but lower than that of the other farms. The fuel consumption of these vineyards was also higher than that of the farms located outside Sardinia. The diesel consumption (after conversion of data from L/ha to g/kg of grapes) for 15 conventional wines from 8 farms located in various regions of central-northern Italy (D'Ammaro et al., 2021b) varied between approximately 8 g/kg and 60 g/kg (on average 35 ± 17.5 g/kg), thus placing the conventional vineyard Dtr of our study towards the higher end of this range. Compared with other organic farms, the diesel consumption of Farm Csm was around four times higher than farms in the north of Italy (Masotti et al., 2022), and around five to eight times higher than the Spanish farms analysed by Villanueva-Rey et al. (2014) across two different years (15 g/kg and 9.2 g/kg, respectively). Notably, the farms considered in the aforementioned studies had higher yields than the smart farms considered in the present study. As the yield increases, the incidence of inputs and the related impacts per unit of harvested produce tends to decrease. Therefore, grape yield is a sensitive parameter that affects the environmental performance of vineyards (Bosco et al., 2011; Sinisterra-Solís et al., 2020). Diesel consumption was allocated to soil operations, irrigation, fertilisation, and pesticide application (complementary Table S1) to evaluate its contribution to the different impact categories of the fuel used for various agricultural operations. Across the four farms examined, 70 % (approximately 60 % in Farm Bsm and more than 80 % in Dtr), on average, of the fuel employed and the related impacts were attributable to soil operations. The remaining fuel was used to distribute fertilisers and pesticides, as discussed in 3.3 Fertilisation, 3.4 Plant protection treatments. More specifically, the incidence of the fuel-related impacts for fertiliser application ranged from approximately 7 % (Csm) to almost 25 % (Bsm) (excluding Dtr, which carried out fertigation) of the overall fuel-related impacts. As regards the application of plant protection products, the percentage contributions ranged from approximately 14 % (Asm) to almost 20 % (Csm) of the overall fuel-related impacts. Focusing on soil operations, it can be seen that Farm Asm recorded the lowest impact for all categories (Fig. 3) since it carried out fewer operations than the other farms (Table 1). In contrast, organic Farm Csm, despite not conducting certain agricultural operations (such as tillage and pre-pruning), had the highest impact. This farm had to repeat the practice of mechanical weed control five times a year, which the other farms either did not carry out (Asm and Bsm) or carried out only once (Dtr). In the organic farm, this practice had to be repeated to prevent the grass from acting as a competitor for water and nutrients, since Farm Csm chose to avoid irrigation and had mostly sandy soil that has very low water retention capacity. Therefore, the extent of the environmental impacts largely depends on farmers' management choices, as observed by Tuomisto et al. (2012). Owing to fuel consumption, soil operations generally had the highest impact on the categories AD, ADff, GW, OLD, HT, MAE, PO, and AF (Table 3), confirming the results obtained by Fusi et al. (2014) and Marras et al. (2015). Field energy was the input most related to GHG emissions, even in Greek farms (Balafoutis et al., 2017), regardless of whether conventional or precision viticulture techniques were used. Sinisterra-Solís et al. (2020) and Volanti et al. (2022) confirmed the primary role of machinery fuel on the negative environmental performances of both organic and conventional Spanish farms. In comparison with the literature, the GW impact category was mostly correlated with fuel consumption. Across the four farms analysed in this study, this category showed a value between 0.28 and 0.61 kg CO2e (Table 3), within the range of about 0.1 to 1.42 kg CO2e per kg of grapes observed in conventional (Balafoutis et al., 2017; Borsato et al., 2020; Bosco et al., 2011; D'Ammaro et al., 2021b; Harb et al., 2021; Laca et al., 2021; Sinisterra-Solís et al., 2020) and integrated (Rouault et al., 2016) vineyards. The organic vineyard has a value of 0.61 kg CO2e, approximately 30 % higher than the average of the other vineyards. Therefore, as confirmed by other studies (Rouault et al., 2016; Rugani et al., 2013), the common opinion that organic agriculture has a lower carbon footprint than conventional agriculture is not universal. On the contrary, the behaviour of Farm Csm differed from that observed in other organic farms whose value of GW was lower than that of conventional, and precisely 0.8–0.9 kg CO2e/kg and 0.138 kg CO2e/kg (average value over a 5-year period) of grapes in vineyards in the north of Italy found by Masotti et al. (2022) and Borsato et al. (2020), respectively. Finally, the GW of Farm Csm is not even comparable with that obtained in Spanish organic vineyards, where the values range between about 0.05 and 0.13 kg CO2e per kg of grapes (Sinisterra-Solís et al., 2020; Villanueva-Rey et al., 2014). In the farms analysed by Villanueva-Rey et al. (2014), however, most of the operations were carried out by hand, thus reducing the use of diesel by 80 %. As suggested by other authors (Vázquez-Rowe et al., 2012; Neto et al., 2013), reducing fuel consumption is the primary strategy for improving the environmental performance of vineyards. Several solutions have been proposed to mitigate emissions from fuel combustion, such as reducing the number and types of operations in vineyards in each season (Rugani et al., 2013) and introducing livestock to manage grass (Villanueva-Rey et al., 2014; Longbottom and Petrie, 2015). These activities imply efforts by agronomists to revise vineyard management techniques. Adopting eco-driving systems for tractors (Dettù et al., 2022), most-performing engines, and biofuel-powered (Hosseinzadeh-Bandbafha et al., 2021), green hydrogen-powered, or electric (Baker et al., 2022; Gao and Xue, 2020; Gorjian et al., 2021; Lagnelöv et al., 2021; Scolaro et al., 2021) tractors could contribute decisively to reducing impacts, a solution which, given the costs of high-tech machinery, is currently difficult to consider, especially in the case of small farms. 3.2. Water consumption and irrigation Water conservation is one of the primary reasons why smart farms use on-site weather stations. Irrigation was not carried out at the organic Farm Csm, whereas significant differences in water consumption were recorded among the other farms (Table 2). The consumption of Farm Asm was 10 times lower (0.05 m3/kg) than Farm Bsm. Farm Dtr performed best in terms of water consumption (0.0015 m3/kg) despite not using IoT devices to detect soil moisture. This difference did not seem to be attributable to the irrigation technique, as smart farms were using variable drip irrigation, whereas Farm Dtr adopted a drip-irrigation system with a uniform rate, which was found to have a consumption of approximately 9 % higher than the variable rate drip-irrigation system (Casson et al., 2022) implemented by smart farms. In this regard, the considerable effect was due to the different soil texture, which in Farm Asm was loamy (i.e., “medium-textured”, with a balanced presence of sand, silt and clay), in Farm Bsm was sandy and, therefore, had a poor water-holding capacity and a tendency to remain dry during the summer season, while the soil in Farm Dtr was mainly clayey and was thus able to retain a great deal of water. The latter also utilises zeolite, which helps to keep the soil aerated and moist for a long time (Yasuda et al., 1998) by reducing the need for irrigation. Farm Bsm's agronomist claimed that by using the on-site weather station with moisture-sensing sensors in the field, irrigation became more rational, preventing the over- or under-watering of different areas of the field; however, this did not result in less overall water consumption. This technician justified the high water consumption by stating that water stress shortens the life cycle of the vines, resulting in high economic losses for the farm. The techno-managerial approach of Farm Csm (no irrigation) does not seem appropriate for oenologists because high water stress can influence the organoleptic characteristics of grapes and, consequently, wine. Indeed, irrigation gives the red wine higher acidity and a better “bouchet” of polyphenols (Borsato et al., 2020; Cavaliere et al., 2010) and the white one a higher aromatic expression with a lower bitter taste (Zufferey et al., 2020). However, the example of Farm Csm demonstrated that even when operating in Mediterranean climatic conditions and with a soil texture which is predominantly sandy, water saving could be possible. Thus, in Farm Bsm, water management seems inefficient, and all the opportunities offered by on-site weather stations should be exploited. Another aspect that might affect water use is the grapevine cultivar, as identified by Balafoutis et al. (2017) in the northern Greek vineyards, where water consumption was different in the case of the Sauvignon and Syrah cultivars (0.23 m3/kg and 0.11 m3/kg, respectively). Sinisterra-Solís et al. (2020) observed that in Spanish vineyards where different varieties were cultivated, the differences in water consumption and other inputs were ascribed to the yield more than the varieties. In this research, the grapevine variety was excluded as a factor influencing the considerable differences in water consumption observed since Vermentino was the exclusive or predominant grape variety cultivated, and, in any case, all the varieties were managed the same way across the farms. Therefore, soil characteristics and vineyard management choices may be more important than other factors in determining water use. Considering that water scarcity and the excessive exploitation of aquifers are factors linked to ongoing climate change and that forecasts indicate a growing demand for water in the Mediterranean area in the near future (Mancuso et al., 2020), the reduction of water consumption is an important challenge for Sardinian viticulture. Therefore, various management options should be considered in vineyards, such as adopting effective cultivation methods that leave the soil settled to prevent the surface runoff of rainwater or avoiding trampling that reduces the macropores, which are considered true soil reservoirs (Giordano, 1999). As shown in Table 3, the irrigation phase generated impacts only in Farms Asm and Dtr because of the energy consumption required to power the irrigation system. Farm Asm drew water from a well that used electricity to run a pump to pressurise the irrigation system, and Farm Dtr used a diesel-powered generator to distribute water from the municipal supply network. In Farm Bsm, the impact of irrigation was zero because it did not consume energy, as it applied gravity-fed surface irrigation by drawing water from a reservoir. Irrigation, the most impactful phase in Farm Asm, was responsible for approximately 50 % of its total impact on the categories linked to air emissions (Table 3), which may be attributable to the Italian power mix that is largely dependent on fossil fuels. Apart from the drip irrigation already practised by farms, Russo et al. (2021) recommended using deficit irrigation and the implementation of photovoltaic-powered irrigation to mitigate GHG emissions and make vineyards more resilient to drought phenomena. Deficit irrigation is possible in the Mediterranean regions, as demonstrated by Farm Csm. However, as stated previously, the effects of high water stress on the quantity and quality of production must be considered. The employment of renewable energy sources could be an appropriate choice from an environmental perspective and could even be integrated into vineyards through innovative specific agrivoltaic solutions (enovoltaics) (Padilla et al., 2022). The impacts of irrigation were greater in Farm Asm than in the Dtr (Table 3) because the latter applied fertigation. Indeed, as explained in Subsection 2.2.1, the diesel consumption to power the fertigation equipment was partly allocated to the fertilisation phase and the remainder to irrigation. Considering the experiences of the traditional Farm Dtr, fertigation could be another solution for mitigating the impact of irrigation. However, this technique is difficult to apply to land with a high slope, and only fertilisers with high water solubility can be distributed. However, the trade-off between water and energy consumption must be considered to meet the vine cultivation and grape quality requirements (Roselli et al., 2020). 3.3. Fertilisation In the fertilisation phase, different fertilisers purchased from the market were used in the vineyards. In addition, unlike the traditional Farm Dtr, smart farms utilise green manure to enrich the soil with nutrients. Farm Asm estimated the input of nutrients from pruning residues of a sample of vines for a more rational use of fertiliser. Generally, eutrophication is the category in which fertilisation has the greatest impact. EP impact was generated almost exclusively by fertilisation, which contributed more than 95 % of the total EP impact, except for the Farm Csm, where the contribution of fertilisation to EP was only 10 % of the total. The contribution of fertilisation to the total impact was by far the weakest in Farm Csm because, for the various categories, its contribution to the total ranged between 5 % and 10 % (on average 7 %), decidedly lower than the impact levels, ranging between 27 % and 42 % (on average 34 % excluding EP), found in Farm Bsm. Although the traditional Farm Dtr used only chemical fertilisers and did not use green manure, the contribution of this phase to the various impact categories, excluding EP, ranged between 0 % and 17 % (on average, 7 %) of the total, an impact similar to or sometimes lower than that of smart farms. To explain the different behaviours and better understand which factors related to the fertilisation phase had the greatest impact, the contributions to the different categories given by the use of machinery for distributing the fertilisers, the production of the fertilisers and their fate in the environment, the transport of fertilisers to the farm from the sale point, and their packaging were considered. Across all the farms considered, the contribution of transporting fertilisers to the farm and their packaging's production and end-of-life was generally negligible (Table 4). In contrast, the major impact on most categories was due to the fuel for the machinery used for fertiliser application. Farm Dtr had a lower impact owing to machinery use than smart farms (Table 4) because it practised fertigation. The change in fertiliser management from conventional to fertigated led to a reduction in emissions derived from the application of products, thus, confirming the findings of Casson et al. (2022).

When considering only the impacts of the products, the data reported in Table 4 provide evidence that the products utilised by Farm Csm (algae) had the lowest impact. In this vineyard, the fertilisers' contribution to the total impact of the various categories did not exceed 3 %. At the same time, in the other farms, excluding EP, it ranged between 1 % and 20 % of the total. Fertilisers contributed, on average, for 5 % of Farm Asm and Dtr and 10 % of Bsm to the total. In Farm Bsm, the greatest contribution was from NPK-based fertilisers. These products were also used by Farm Dtr; however, the amounts employed were one-third of those employed by Farm Bsm (Table 2). Farm Dtr had a nutrient-rich, clayey soil with less need for fertilisers (Table 1). Furthermore, it uses zeolite, one of its properties being the prolonged action of the fertiliser, which prevents the leaching of nutrients into the soil (Soltys et al., 2020). NPK-based products affect different product categories. The contribution of these fertilisers to GW, PO, and AF is principally related to their production processes, particularly the consumption of fossil fuels and the extraction of phosphorus or potassium from rock materials (Bosco et al., 2011; Casson et al., 2022). Furthermore, urea production contributed to the HT category, especially with regard to the emission of metals (in particular, Ba, Ni, Cr VI, and Hg). P- and N-based compounds were responsible for the eutrophication caused by Farms Bsm and Dtr (Fig. 2). These products are translocated through runoff and leach into water, which significantly affects the EP category (Jourdaine et al., 2020; Ngatia and Taylor, 2018). Farm Asm, which used pelleted manure, contributed the most to the ecotoxicity categories (Table 4). Manure is considered a product with a high environmental burden, principally regarding CH4 emissions when spread on the soil (Volanti et al., 2022). Nevertheless, it was proved that pelletising-drying could lower the nitrogen and CH4 emissions from agro-biowaste compost (Ball et al., 2004) and mitigate the farm's environmental impact by more than 63 % (Sarlaki et al., 2021). In addition, the pelleted manure used in Farm Asm was inoculated with the selected microbial strains. Compared to those not inoculated, this fertiliser allows a 40–60 % reduction in N2O emissions (Nishizawa et al., 2014). Therefore, the impact of Farm Asm may have been overestimated. Pelleted manure principally affected the EP category, like the NPK compounds. Therefore, approximately 97 % of the eutrophication caused by Farm Asm was due to this natural fertiliser. Other natural products, such as algae employed by Farm Csm, had little effect on all environmental categories, including EP. Thus, vineyards employing natural fertilisers did not necessarily have a lower level of impact than those utilising synthetic fertilisers, as highlighted by the comparison between Farms Asm and Dtr. Therefore, farmers should consciously choose the type and quantity of these products while considering their environmental burden. 3.4. Plant protection treatments In smart vineyards, on-site weather stations integrated with DSS were used for irrigation and pest management. Indeed, microclimatic conditions, such as local temperature, sun exposure, and average annual rainfall, influence vine diseases, and the quantity of pesticides to be applied in the vineyard (Ferrara and De Feo, 2018). As shown in Table 2, differences were observed in the types and quantities of pesticides used in the vineyards. Similar to other certified organic farms (Borsato et al., 2020; Masotti et al., 2022; Volanti et al., 2022), Farm Csm exclusively utilises mineral products, and this type of plant protection product is among the few pesticides allowed in organic farming. However, considering that Cu accumulation may alter soil life, using Cu compounds in viticulture remains controversial. Karimi et al. (2021) reported that an amount of up to 4 kg/ha/year of Cu should not substantially modify soil biological quality and function. Based on this consideration, the amount of copper used by Farm Csm (2.7 kg/ha/year) was lower than the proposed limit (Karimi et al., 2021). The same considerations are valid for Farm Asm and Dtr utilising an amount of Cu compounds equal to 0.05 kg/ha/year and 0.9 kg/ha/year, respectively. Smart Farms Asm and Bsm, as well as the traditional Dtr, utilised mineral and synthetic products, particularly mancozeb, folpet, and fosetyl-aluminium, as a single pesticide or a combination thereof (Table 2). These chemicals are often used in conventional viticulture, as observed in Italian (Borsato et al., 2020; Ferrara and De Feo, 2018; Fusi et al., 2014), French (Rouault et al., 2016), and Spanish (Vázquez-Rowe et al., 2012; Villanueva-Rey et al., 2014) vineyards. Generally, the categories in which the pest control phase had the greatest impact were abiotic depletion and ecotoxicity. The contribution of these categories to the total burden was higher than the levels registered for the others, accounting for 1 % to 15 % on all the farms, except for the organic vineyard Csm, where the levels ranged between 20 % to 24 %. Notably, in this phase, traditional farms that did not use advanced technologies had similar or lower impacts than smart farms across all categories except for FAE and TE (Table 3). To identify the factors related to pest control that contributed the most to the different categories, the impacts of using machinery, products, and the transport and packaging of pesticides were considered (Table 4). As previously observed for fertilisation, these latter factors made a negligible contribution to the impact categories, whereas the greatest impact was attributable to the use of machinery to spread pesticides. This factor had the highest incidence in the organic Farm Csm, which was carried out twice as many times (12/year) with low doses of pesticides compared to the other farms, as it used highly leachable sulfur and copper-based products. Similar results have been observed in Italian (Volanti et al., 2022), French (Rouault et al., 2016), and Cypriot (Litskas et al., 2020) organic vineyards. Litskas et al. (2020) attributed the substitution of synthetic pesticides to an increase in fuel consumption. In the case of Farm Csm, the replacement of chemicals increased treatment frequency and, consequently, aggravated the impacts associated with the pest control phase. By considering only the plant protection products, generally, for all the categories, excluding abiotic depletion and those linked to ecotoxicity, the contribution of pesticides to the total burden ranged between 1 and 5 %. To summarise, the contribution of pesticides to the total impact caused by the vineyards was, on average, 15 %, 3 %, 4 %, and 17 % for Farm Asm, Bsm, Csm, and Dtr, respectively. Farm Asm had the greatest impact in five of the 11 categories (Table 4), principally due to the pesticides mancozeb and fosetyl-aluminium. Mancozeb, also used by Farm Bsm in quantities similar to Asm, mainly affects AD due to the extraction of sulfur and metals employed for its production, as this pesticide is a manganese/zinc ethylene-bis-dithiocarbamate, and PO and AF for sulfur dioxide emissions during its production. Mancozeb's contribution to MAE due to the toxic effect of this pesticide on aquatic organisms (Vieira et al., 2020) was negligible (1 % of the total burden), confirming the findings of Russo et al. (2021). Considering that mancozeb exposure has been linked to a wide range of environmental and health hazards, the European Commission issued Regulation No. 2020/2087 (2020), which banned mancozeb use from 2022. Despite this, in 2021 (the year of data collection), two smart farms were using this pesticide, contrary to the traditional Farm Dtr, which did not utilise this product. Folpet and fosetyl-aluminium were used in Farms Asm and Dtr. In particular, these pesticides affected the impact categories connected to ecotoxicity due to their emissions into the air, water, and soil (Table 4). The effect of these two vineyards on FAE depended entirely (99 %) on the use of Folpet, and the impact of Farm Dtr on TE was, for about 70 % of the total, depending on the use of fosetyl-aluminium; Asm and Dtr use these two products in different quantities. In particular, Farm Asm used approximately one-third of the folpet (0.025 g/kg) used by the other farm and tripled the quantity of fosetyl-aluminium (0.43 g/kg). The various quantities of these two pesticides used indicated that Farm Asm contributed the most to MAE, and Dtr contributed the most to FAE and TE (Table 4). Other viticulture studies (Renaud-Gentié et al., 2015; Vázquez-Rowe et al., 2012; Villanueva-Rey et al., 2014) have highlighted the effects of folpet on MAE. Organic Farm Csm, which exclusively used mineral products based on copper, sulfur, and bentonite, had the least impact on all categories except for AD, HT, and EP, which made the most significant contributions. AD is related to sulfur and copper extraction, whereas the production of copper (Beylot and Villeneuve, 2017) and bentonite, to a minor extent (Zhou et al., 2021), contributes to HT and EP. The effect of Cu compounds on these categories is mainly linked to the emission of toxic metals during production and storage (Beylot and Villeneuve, 2017). Cu-related impacts may be overestimated because they are not adequately characterised by existing LCIA methods (Rouault et al., 2020). 3.5. Normalisation The normalized results (complementary Fig. S1) showed that the categories that, in general, presented the greatest relative impacts were FAE (especially for Farms Bsm and Asm) and MAE, followed by EP (except for Farm Csm). Plant protection treatments are responsible for virtually all contributions to FAE. MAE was mainly affected by soil operations (diesel), except for Farm Asm, which was irrigation because of related power generation. However, as highlighted in the literature, toxicity categories have a particularly high degree of uncertainty owing to incomplete inventory data for the reference system and lack of characterisation factors (Benini and Sala, 2016; Crenna et al., 2019; Scalbi et al., 2015; Van Hoof et al., 2013). Therefore, excluding the toxicity categories, the most affected impact category in Farms Asm, Bsm, and Dtr was EP due to the fertilisation phase. Fertilisation affected EP in both Farm Asm and Bsm through the phosphorus pentoxide included in the fertilisation product. In Farm Csm normalisation, the highest contribution was made by soil operations in all impact categories, confirming what was found with the characterisation. Excluding MAE, the most affected impact category was ADff, due to the use of fossil fuels. 4. Conclusion Considering the limited studies related to the effect of smart farming on environmental impacts, research was conducted to evaluate the ecological effectiveness of vineyards employing on-site weather stations integrated with a DSS and to identify the critical hotspots that may persist in smart farms which have already started on the path towards sustainability. The results obtained through the LCA methodology showed that soil characteristics can exert both positive and negative influences on various aspects of environmental performance, irrespective of the use of decision-supporting technological devices. Agricultural machinery or electricity use were the major sources of impact; therefore, the main strategy for vineyard sustainability involves adopting measures to reduce the use of field energy. In addition, the results of this study highlight that replacing agrochemicals with natural products would not be the most appropriate choice from an environmental perspective. The contribution of organic fertilisers to certain impact categories could be higher than that of synthetic products, as in the case of an integrated smart farm which utilised pelleted manure, which had the greatest effect on the categories linked to ecotoxicity. Moreover, the objective of reducing herbicide, fertiliser, pesticide use, and water consumption in compliance with integrated or biological certification requirements shifted some of the environmental burdens to other life cycle steps, as in the case of the organic farm, whereby the water footprint improved, but the carbon footprint worsened. Employing on-site weather stations to monitor climatic and soil conditions is insufficient for improving environmental performance. This study could enhance management and staff awareness of the importance of an integrated assessment throughout the life cycle stages of products to ensure a robust methodology to effectively leverage the advantage of technological innovation. Moreover, this study could be significant in assisting relevant stakeholders with decision-making to ensure a balanced trade-off between environmentally friendly and economically feasible options. A limitation of this study is that it was not possible to analyse the environmental performance of grape production before and after the installation of on-site weather stations to better understand how much these technologies could influence it. Further studies are required to deepen our knowledge of the environmental effects of smart farming to allow farmers to profit from the prime opportunities offered by smart technologies. Moreover, to achieve this objective, the economic aspects of grape production can effectively contribute to a comparative analysis of the sustainability of adopting technical management.

A systematic review of automated systems for real-time irrigation management

1. INTRODUCTION
The challenge of feeding a growing population with finite resources is becoming increasingly pressing. By 2050, the world population is expected to reach 9.7 billion, necessitating a 70% increase in food production (Falkenmark and Rockstrom, 2009). Irrigation plays a crucial role in enhancing crop yields and agricultural productivity to meet this growing demand. Studies have shown that irrigation can significantly increase crop water productivity, contributing to increased food production (Ali and Talukder, 2008; Playan and Mateos, 2005). However, water scarcity poses a significant challenge, with many regions facing water deficits and the need for improved water management practices (Falkenmark and Rockstrom, 2009). Optimizing irrigation schedules and doses based on crop requirements and environmental conditions is essential for maximizing yield and quality while minimizing water use (Zhang et al., 2024). The necessity of scalable water-efficient practices for increasing food demand cannot be overstated. Techniques such as regulated deficit irrigation, magnetically treated water, and the use of drought-tolerant crops like sorghum have shown promise in improving water productivity and ensuring food security (Mehmood et al., 2023; Putti et al., 2023; Hadebe et al., 2016). As the global food challenge intensifies, it is imperative to critically evaluate the current state and future potential of irrigation management systems to guide research, innovation, and implementation efforts towards fully autonomous, scalable solutions.

Despite the importance of irrigation in addressing the global food challenge, traditional irrigation management techniques, such as manual scheduling and timer-based systems, have significant limitations. These methods are often labor-intensive, inefficient, and less adaptable to changing conditions (Savin et al., 2023). Manual and timer-based scheduling can lead to high operational costs and inefficient water use (Raghavendra, Han, and Shin, 2023). The reliance on manual intervention and predetermined schedules limits their adaptability to changing environmental conditions, crop water requirements, and soil moisture levels (Kaptein et al., 2019). Sensor-based irrigation systems offer an alternative, enabling real-time adjustments based on soil water status measurements (Kaptein et al., 2019). However, the adoption of these systems in commercial settings has been limited, often requiring extensive input from researchers (Kim et al., 2014; Lea-Cox et al., 2018; Ristvey et al., 2018). The limitations of traditional irrigation management techniques highlight the need for scalable, automated solutions for greater efficiency in irrigation management. Automated systems that collect real-time data, analyze it, and make autonomous irrigation decisions can lead to improved water use efficiency and increased crop productivity (Champness et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2022). To fully understand the potential of automated systems, it is necessary to examine the automation of each part of the irrigation management pipeline and analyze the effectiveness and efficiency of integrated end-to-end solutions.

The emergence of smart irrigation management and IoT marks a significant shift from historical irrigation practices. Modern approaches rely on vast data and analysis algorithms, leveraging technologies such as remote sensing, sensor networks, weather data, and computational algorithms (Atanasov, 2023; Bellvert et al., 2023; Kumar et al., 2023). IoT plays a vital role in collecting vast amounts of data through sensors, data transmission, and tailored networks, enabling real-time monitoring and control of irrigation systems (Liakos, 2023; Zuckerman et al., 2024). These advancements in data collection and analysis have the potential to revolutionize irrigation management, allowing for more precise and efficient water use. However, challenges such as processing diverse data sources, data integration, and lack of integrated data analysis hamper the full benefit of IoT in irrigation management (Dave et al., 2023). The current fragmented approach in smart irrigation, focusing on individual components rather than the entire system, limits the potential for fully autonomous, real-time end-to-end irrigation management (Togneri et al., 2021). To address these challenges and fully realize the potential of smart irrigation management, there is a need for automating and integrating each section of the irrigation management pipeline, from sensor/weather data collection and transmission to processing, analysis, decision-making, and automated action (McKinion and Lemmon, 1985). This integration requires a thorough investigation of the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling seamless communication and compatibility between components within the automated irrigation management pipeline.

Machine learning (ML) plays a significant role in processing vast data, predicting plant stress, modeling climate effects, and optimizing irrigation in smart irrigation management systems. ML algorithms can analyze data collected from sensors and weather stations to determine optimal irrigation schedules (Vianny et al., 2022). However, the potential of ML is often constrained by manual steps, such as data interpretation, decision-making on irrigation timing and volume, and system adjustments. Automating ML integration to allow direct action from insights to irrigation execution, removing bottlenecks and achieving real-time adaptability, is crucial for fully autonomous irrigation management (Barzallo-Bertot et al., 2022). By integrating ML into automated systems, the irrigation management pipeline can become more seamless and efficient, enabling real-time decision-making and action based on data-driven insights. To achieve this level of automation and integration, it is essential to identify gaps and propose solutions for seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, aiming to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.

To achieve seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, interoperability and standardization are critical. Interoperability allows different system components, such as sensors, actuators, and software, to communicate and exchange data effectively, while standardization ensures that data is represented in a consistent format (Santos et al., 2020). Standardized protocols and data formats are essential for achieving seamless integration and ensuring compatibility between components in real-time irrigation management systems (Robles et al., 2022; Hatzivasilis et al., 2018). Existing and emerging standards, such as OGC SensorThings API and ISO 11783, have applicability to real-time irrigation management systems (Hazra et al., 2021). However, challenges such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security need to be addressed to fully realize the potential of interoperability and standardization in automated irrigation management systems (Hazra et al., 2021). Addressing these challenges is crucial for enabling the seamless integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline, which is essential for achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. A comprehensive evaluation of the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling the integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline is necessary to guide future research and implementation efforts.
The primary objective of this systematic review is to critically evaluate the current state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies for enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
Specific objectives include:
•	Examining the automation of each part of the irrigation management pipeline and the seamless integration of each section in the context of irrigation scheduling and management.

By addressing these objectives, this systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive and critical evaluation of the current state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems. Its intention is to guide future research, innovation, and implementation efforts to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management that can contribute to addressing the global food challenge.

3. DATA COLLECTION TO CLOUD: AUTOMATION AND REAL-TIME PROCESSING
3.1. Irrigation management data
The success of automated irrigation management systems relies heavily on the collection, transmission, and analysis of various types of data. The most applicable data types for irrigation management include soil moisture, canopy temperature, weather data, and plant physiological parameters (Farooq et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Olivier et al., 2021; Evett et al., 2020). These data are typically collected from a range of sources, including in-field sensors, remote sensing platforms, weather stations, and manual measurements (Li et al., 2019; Karimi et al., 2018).
Soil moisture data is arguably the most critical type of data for irrigation management, as it directly reflects the water available to plants and can be used to determine the optimal timing and amount of irrigation (Olivier et al., 2021; Intrigliolo & Castel, 2006). Soil moisture sensors, such as tensiometers, capacitance probes, and time-domain reflectometry (TDR) sensors, can provide real-time measurements of soil water content at various depths (Farooq et al., 2019). These sensors can be deployed in a network configuration to capture spatial variability in soil moisture across a field (Karimi et al., 2018).
Canopy temperature data is another valuable type of data for irrigation management, as it can be used to assess plant water stress and adjust irrigation accordingly (Evett et al., 2020). Infrared thermometers and thermal cameras can be used to measure canopy temperature, which is influenced by factors such as air temperature, humidity, wind speed, and plant water status (Li et al., 2019). When plants experience water stress, they tend to close their stomata to reduce water loss, leading to an increase in canopy temperature (Evett et al., 2020). By monitoring canopy temperature and comparing it to reference values, automated irrigation systems can detect plant water stress and trigger irrigation events to maintain optimal plant health and productivity (Li et al., 2019).
Weather data, including temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, and solar radiation, are essential for predicting crop water requirements and scheduling irrigation events (Akilan & Baalamurugan, 2024). Weather stations equipped with various sensors can provide real-time measurements of these parameters, which can be used as inputs for crop water requirement models, such as the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith equation (Li et al., 2019). These models estimate crop evapotranspiration (ET) based on weather data and crop-specific coefficients, allowing for the calculation of irrigation requirements (Intrigliolo & Castel, 2006). By integrating weather data into automated irrigation systems, irrigation schedules can be dynamically adjusted based on changing environmental conditions, ensuring that crops receive the optimal amount of water at the right time (Akilan & Baalamurugan, 2024).
When collecting and utilizing these data types, several considerations must be taken into account, including the volume, frequency, format, and source of the data (Farooq et al., 2019). The volume of data generated by automated irrigation systems can be substantial, especially when high-resolution sensors are deployed at a large scale (Bastidas Pacheco et al., 2022). This necessitates the use of efficient data storage, processing, and transmission technologies to handle the data load (Farooq et al., 2019). The frequency of data collection is another important consideration, as it directly impacts the temporal resolution of the data and the ability to detect rapid changes in plant water status or environmental conditions (Bastidas Pacheco et al., 2022). Bastidas Pacheco et al. (2022) demonstrated that collecting full pulse resolution data from water meters provides more accurate estimates of event occurrence, timing, and features compared to aggregated temporal resolutions, highlighting the importance of selecting appropriate data collection frequencies to ensure the quality and usefulness of the data for irrigation management.
The format of the data is also crucial, as it determines the compatibility and interoperability of the data with various analysis tools and platforms (Farooq et al., 2019). Standardized data formats, such as JSON, XML, or CSV, can facilitate data exchange and integration between different components of the automated irrigation system (Zhang et al., 2023). The source of the data is another important consideration, as it can impact the reliability, accuracy, and spatial coverage of the data (Farooq et al., 2019). For example, in-field sensors provide highly localized measurements, while remote sensing platforms, such as satellites or drones, can provide data at larger spatial scales (Li et al., 2019). By combining data from multiple sources, automated irrigation systems can achieve a more comprehensive understanding of crop water requirements and optimize irrigation management accordingly (Farooq et al., 2019).
Data quality, accuracy, and reliability are paramount in irrigation management, as they directly impact the effectiveness of decision-making processes and the efficiency of water use (Gupta et al., 2020). Inaccurate or unreliable data can lead to suboptimal irrigation decisions, resulting in crop stress, yield losses, or wasted water resources (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022). Gupta et al. (2020) emphasized the critical importance of data security and privacy in smart farming systems, as the leakage of sensitive agricultural data can cause severe economic losses to farmers and compromise the integrity of the automated irrigation system. The authors also highlighted the need for robust authentication and secure communication protocols to prevent unauthorized access to smart farming systems and protect data in transit (Gupta et al., 2020).
Ramli and Jabbar (2022) addressed the challenges associated with implementing real-time, automated irrigation systems, including data quality, scalability, reliability, and security. They proposed solutions and best practices based on the analysis of case studies and real-world implementations, such as the use of redundant sensors, data validation techniques, and secure communication protocols (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022). The authors also emphasized the importance of regular maintenance and calibration of sensors to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the collected data (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022).
Researchers have investigated the use of data compression, aggregation, and filtering techniques to reduce bandwidth requirements and improve transmission efficiency in automated irrigation systems (Karim et al., 2023; Rady et al., 2020; Cui, 2023). Karim et al. (2023) explored the effectiveness of various data compression techniques, such as lossless and lossy compression algorithms, in reducing the size of data packets transmitted over wireless networks. The authors found that lossless compression techniques, such as Huffman coding and Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW), can significantly reduce data size without compromising data quality, while lossy compression techniques, such as JPEG and MP3, can further reduce data size by introducing acceptable levels of distortion (Karim et al., 2023).
Rady et al. (2020) developed a novel data compression algorithm specifically designed for irrigation data, which achieved significant compression ratios without compromising data quality. The authors demonstrated that their algorithm could reduce the amount of data transmitted over wireless networks, thereby improving the efficiency of the irrigation system and reducing costs (Rady et al., 2020). Cui (2023) investigated the use of data aggregation and filtering techniques to reduce the number of transmissions and save bandwidth in automated irrigation systems. The author proposed a data aggregation scheme that combines multiple sensor readings into a single value, such as the average soil moisture over a specified time interval, to reduce the frequency of data transmissions (Cui, 2023). Additionally, the author explored the use of data filtering techniques, such as Kalman filters and particle filters, to remove noise and outliers from sensor data, improving the accuracy and reliability of the transmitted information (Cui, 2023).
Data standardization and harmonization are crucial for facilitating seamless integration and interoperability between the various components of automated irrigation management systems (Zhang et al., 2023; Ermoliev et al., 2022). Zhang et al. (2023) developed a novel cyberinformatics technology called iCrop, which enables the in-season monitoring of crop-specific land cover across the contiguous United States. The authors highlighted the importance of data standardization and harmonization in the context of iCrop, as it allows for the efficient distribution of crop-specific land cover information based on the findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data principle (Zhang et al., 2023). By adopting standardized data formats and protocols, such as the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards, iCrop enables the seamless integration of various data sources and facilitates the interoperability of the system with other agricultural decision support tools (Zhang et al., 2023).
Ermoliev et al. (2022) proposed a linkage methodology for linking distributed sectoral/regional optimization models in a situation where private information is not available or cannot be shared by modeling teams. The authors emphasized the need for data standardization to enable decentralized cross-sectoral coordination and analysis, as it allows for the consistent representation and exchange of data between different models and stakeholders (Ermoliev et al., 2022). By adopting standardized data formats and interfaces, the proposed linkage methodology can facilitate the integration of various optimization models and support the development of comprehensive decision support systems for sustainable resource management (Ermoliev et al., 2022).
Metadata plays a vital role in providing context and enabling better data interpretation and decision-making in automated irrigation management systems (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021). Metadata refers to the additional information that describes the characteristics, quality, and context of the primary data, such as the sensor type, calibration parameters, measurement units, and timestamp (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021). Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al. (2021) highlighted the importance of metadata in water resources management, as it enables decision-makers to use the data to the best of its capabilities by understanding factors such as when water data was collected and what factors might have contributed to the measurements. The authors emphasized the need for standardized metadata formats and guidelines, such as the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) and the ISO 19115 standard, to ensure the consistency and interoperability of metadata across different water information systems (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021).
In the context of automated irrigation management systems, metadata can provide valuable information about the data collection process, sensor performance, and environmental conditions that can aid in data interpretation and decision-making (Cota & Mamede, 2023). For example, metadata about the sensor type and calibration parameters can help assess the accuracy and reliability of the collected data, while metadata about the weather conditions and soil properties can provide context for interpreting the data and adjusting irrigation strategies accordingly (Cota & Mamede, 2023). By incorporating metadata into the data management and analysis pipeline of automated irrigation systems, decision-makers can make more informed and context-aware decisions, leading to improved water use efficiency and crop productivity (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021).

3.2. Edge Computing and Fog Computing
Edge computing and fog computing have emerged as transformative technologies in the realm of real-time irrigation management systems, offering significant potential for improving efficiency, scalability, and reliability (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2019). Edge computing refers to the practice of processing data near the edge of the network, close to the source of the data, while fog computing is a decentralized computing infrastructure that extends cloud computing capabilities to the network edge (Hassija et al., 2019). These technologies bring computation and analytics closer to the data source, reducing the need for data to travel to the cloud and enabling faster processing and decision-making (Hassija et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020).
The potential of edge computing and fog computing in real-time irrigation management is immense. Abdel Nasser et al. (2020) proposed a two-layer system for water demand prediction using automated meters and machine learning techniques, demonstrating the potential of edge computing in improving the efficiency and scalability of irrigation management. The system collects and aggregates data from distributed smart meters in the first layer, while the second layer uses LSTM neural networks to predict water demand for different regions of households. By leveraging edge computing, the system can achieve high accuracy in predicting water demand, which is essential for efficient irrigation management (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020).
Tran et al. (2019) conducted a comprehensive review of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems, highlighting the role of fog computing in addressing data transmission challenges and enabling seamless integration across the irrigation management pipeline. The authors emphasize that real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems have the potential to significantly improve water efficiency, crop yields, and reduce labor costs. However, they also identify several challenges that need to be addressed, such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security, which can be effectively tackled by implementing fog computing architectures (Tran et al., 2019).
Edge computing offers several benefits in real-time irrigation management systems, including reduced latency, real-time decision-making, and reduced reliance on cloud connectivity (Mishra, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). By processing data closer to the source, edge computing enables faster response times and more efficient data handling (Mishra, 2020). Mishra (2020) highlights that edge computing reduces latency by processing data closer to the source, enabling real-time decision-making and lessening reliance on cloud connectivity by shifting processing to local or edge devices.
Zhang et al. (2020) explore the application of edge computing in agricultural settings, demonstrating its potential to improve the efficiency and accuracy of irrigation systems. The authors discuss how edge computing has prospects in various agricultural applications, such as pest identification, safety traceability of agricultural products, unmanned agricultural machinery, agricultural technology promotion, and intelligent management. They also emphasize that the emergence of edge computing models, such as fog computing, cloudlet, and mobile edge computing, has transformed the management and operation of farms (Zhang et al., 2020).
Fog computing plays a crucial role in distributing processing and storage across the network, enhancing the scalability and reliability of automated irrigation systems (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022; Singh et al., 2022). Premkumar and Sigappi (2022) evaluate the current state of automated irrigation management systems and propose a hybrid machine learning approach for predicting soil moisture and managing irrigation. Their study emphasizes the potential of fog computing in distributing processing and storage across the network, improving the efficiency and scalability of irrigation systems. The proposed hybrid machine learning approach outperforms other machine learning algorithms in predicting soil moisture, demonstrating the effectiveness of fog computing in enhancing the performance of automated irrigation systems (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022).
Singh et al. (2022) discuss the role of fog computing in distributing processing and storage across the network, enhancing scalability and reliability in agricultural management systems. The authors argue that by implementing fog computing, these systems can achieve faster data processing and response times, improving overall efficiency and effectiveness. They also highlight that fog computing can address the challenges faced by real-time data transmission in agricultural management systems, such as latency, bandwidth limitations, and data security (Singh et al., 2022).
The integration of edge and fog computing in real-time irrigation management systems is crucial for achieving fully automated, scalable, and reliable solutions. As the demand for autonomous irrigation management grows, these technologies will play a pivotal role in enabling faster decision-making, reduced latency, improved resource utilization, and seamless integration across the irrigation management pipeline (Tran et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020). By bringing computation and analytics closer to the data source and distributing processing and storage across the network, edge and fog computing can significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of automated irrigation systems, contributing to the overall goal of addressing the global food challenge through optimized water resource management and increased agricultural productivity (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022; Singh et al., 2022).

3.3. Automation of Data Collection
The automation of data collection is a critical component in the development of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies. It enables the efficient gathering of vital information about crop health, environmental conditions, and water requirements, which is essential for enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity. Two key aspects of automated data collection are the use of advanced sensing technologies for non-invasive plant stress detection and the implementation of wireless sensor networks and energy-efficient communication protocols for large-scale, long-term data collection.
Advanced sensing technologies, such as hyperspectral imaging and thermal sensing, have emerged as powerful tools for non-invasive plant stress detection in automated irrigation management systems. These technologies provide valuable information about crop traits, enabling early and accurate detection of plant health issues (Triantafyllou et al., 2019). Triantafyllou et al. (2019) propose a comprehensive reference architecture model that incorporates advanced sensing technologies in the sensor layer for real-time plant stress detection, highlighting their importance in providing non-invasive plant stress detection. Similarly, Hossain et al. (2023) present a novel IoT-ML-Blockchain integrated framework for smart agricultural management that leverages advanced sensing technologies to optimize water use and improve crop yield, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
Hyperspectral imaging can capture subtle changes in plant physiology that are indicative of stress, while machine learning algorithms can be employed to extract meaningful patterns from the spectral data and classify different stress types (Araus et al., 2014). Thermal sensing can detect changes in canopy temperature, which is influenced by factors such as plant water status (Li et al., 2019). By monitoring canopy temperature and comparing it to reference values, automated irrigation systems can detect plant water stress and trigger irrigation events to maintain optimal plant health and productivity (Li et al., 2019).
The integration of advanced sensing technologies in automated irrigation management systems has the potential to revolutionize precision agriculture. Jiang et al. (2019) demonstrate the effectiveness of a deep learning-based model in accurately detecting leaf spot diseases, highlighting the importance of image augmentation and deep learning algorithms in enhancing the model's performance.
Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and energy-efficient communication protocols have the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and reliability of data collection in large-scale, long-term irrigation systems. WSNs offer a cost-effective and scalable solution for real-time data collection in large-scale irrigation systems, providing remote monitoring and automated control capabilities (Mehdizadeh et al., 2020). Nishiura and Yamamoto (2021) propose a novel sensor network system that utilizes drones and wireless power transfer to autonomously collect environmental data from sensor nodes in vast agricultural fields, reducing operational costs and enhancing the efficiency of data collection. Similarly, Higashiura and Yamamoto (2021) introduce a network system that employs UAVs and LoRa communication to efficiently collect environmental data from sensor nodes distributed across large farmlands, optimizing data collection and reducing travel distance and time.
Energy-efficient communication protocols are crucial for ensuring reliable data transmission in challenging environmental conditions and extending the lifespan of sensor nodes (Mehdizadeh et al., 2020). Al-Ali et al. (2023) investigate the potential of WSNs and energy-efficient communication protocols for data collection in large-scale, long-term irrigation systems, discussing the challenges and opportunities of using these technologies to improve the efficiency and reliability of real-time data collection in irrigation management. Mehdizadeh et al. (2020) emphasize the need for careful consideration of factors such as data accuracy, energy consumption, and network reliability when designing effective WSNs for irrigation management, enabling timely irrigation decisions and improved crop yields.
The automation of data collection through the use of advanced sensing technologies and wireless sensor networks is essential for achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. By enabling non-invasive plant stress detection and large-scale, long-term data collection, these technologies contribute to the overall goal of optimizing water resource management and increasing agricultural productivity. The integration of these technologies in real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems has the potential to enhance agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity, ultimately contributing to the development of fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management solutions.

3.4: Real-Time Data Transmission Protocols and Technologies
Real-time data transmission is a critical component of automated irrigation management systems, as it enables the timely delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of suitable protocols and network architectures is essential for ensuring efficient and reliable data transmission in these systems, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
The Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol has emerged as a popular choice for real-time data transmission in IoT networks, including those used for automated irrigation management. MQTT is a lightweight, publish-subscribe protocol designed for constrained devices and low-bandwidth networks (Author, 2019). Its simplicity and low overhead make it well-suited for IoT applications where data transmission speed and energy efficiency are critical (Saranyadevi et al., 2022). MQTT provides three Quality of Service (QoS) levels, ensuring data reliability in real-time scenarios (Author, 2019). Chen et al. (2020) proposed novel algorithms to improve data exchange efficiency and handle rerouting in MQTT-based IoT networks for automated irrigation management systems. Their TBRouting algorithm efficiently finds the shortest paths for data transmission, while the Rerouting algorithm effectively handles the rerouting of topic-based session flows when a broker crashes. The combination of these algorithms can significantly improve the performance and reliability of automated irrigation management systems (Chen et al., 2020).
Client-server IoT networks, such as those based on MQTT, play a crucial role in real-time data transmission for automated irrigation management systems. In these networks, sensors and devices (clients) publish data to a central broker (server), which then distributes the data to subscribed clients (Verma et al., 2021). This architecture enables efficient data collection, processing, and dissemination, facilitating the integration of various components within the automated irrigation management pipeline. Verma et al. (2021) proposed an architecture for healthcare monitoring systems using IoT and communication protocols, which provides a comprehensive overview of existing approaches and highlights challenges and opportunities in the field. Although focused on healthcare, the insights from this study can be applied to automated irrigation management systems, emphasizing the importance of interoperability and standardization for seamless integration (Verma et al., 2021).
In addition to MQTT, other application layer protocols such as XMPP, CoAP, SOAP, and HTTP have been explored for real-time data transmission in IoT networks. Each protocol has its strengths and weaknesses, making them suitable for different applications and scenarios. XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) is an open-standard protocol that supports real-time messaging, presence, and request-response services (Saint-Andre, 2011). CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) is a specialized web transfer protocol designed for use with constrained nodes and networks in the Internet of Things (Shelby et al., 2014). SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services, while HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web (Fielding et al., 1999).
Motamedi and Villányi (2022) compared and evaluated wireless communication protocols for the implementation of smart irrigation systems in greenhouses, considering factors such as power consumption, range, reliability, and scalability. They found that ZigBee is the most suitable local communication protocol for greenhouse irrigation due to its large number of nodes and long range, while MQTT is the recommended messaging protocol for smart irrigation systems due to its TCP transport protocol and quality of service (QoS) options. GSM is a reliable and cost-effective global communication protocol for greenhouse irrigation, providing wide coverage and low cost (Motamedi & Villányi, 2022).
Syafarinda et al. (2018) investigated the use of the MQTT protocol in a precision agriculture system using a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). They found that MQTT is suitable for use in IoT applications due to its lightweight, simple, and low bandwidth requirements. The average data transmission speed using the MQTT protocol was approximately 1 second, demonstrating its effectiveness for real-time data transmission in precision agriculture systems (Syafarinda et al., 2018).
The choice of application layer protocol for real-time irrigation management depends on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. MQTT and RTPS (Real-Time Publish-Subscribe) are both suitable for real-time data transmission in IoT systems, but they have different strengths and weaknesses. MQTT is a better choice for applications that require low latency and high throughput, while RTPS is a better choice for applications that require high reliability and low latency (Sanchez-Iborra & Skarmeta, 2021). The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of various application layer protocols, provides valuable insights into the suitability of these technologies for real-time data transmission in automated irrigation management systems.
In summary, real-time data transmission protocols and technologies play a vital role in the automation of irrigation management systems, enabling the efficient and reliable delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of application layer protocols, highlights the importance of selecting suitable technologies based on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. By leveraging these technologies, automated irrigation management systems can achieve seamless integration and contribute to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.

3.5. Challenges and Solutions in Real-Time Data Transmission
Following the exploration of data collection, processing at the edge and fog, and automation in previous sections, we now turn to the critical aspect of real-time data transmission. While essential for automated irrigation management, this stage presents unique challenges that must be addressed to ensure system efficiency and reliability.
Obstacles in Real-Time Data Transmission
Agricultural environments present unique challenges for real-time data transmission, directly impacting the effectiveness of automated irrigation systems. Environmental factors can significantly disrupt wireless communication. Adverse weather conditions such as heavy rain, fog, and high winds can weaken or even block radio signals, leading to data loss and compromised system performance. Physical obstacles like trees, buildings, and uneven terrain further complicate signal propagation, creating reliability issues (Jukan et al., 2017; Yi & Ji, 2014; Zhang, Chang & Baoguo, 2018). These environmental challenges necessitate robust communication protocols and network architectures that can ensure consistent and reliable data flow.
In addition to environmental factors, technical limitations also present significant obstacles. Large-scale agricultural operations often demand long-distance data transmission, which can be hindered by the limited range of certain wireless communication protocols. Network congestion, occurring when multiple sensors transmit data concurrently, can lead to delays and potential data loss, further complicating real-time decision-making (Hameed et al., 2020). To mitigate these issues, researchers have investigated the potential of cognitive radio networks (CRNs) and dynamic spectrum access (DSA) for optimizing spectrum utilization and reducing interference (Righi et al., 2017; Shafi et al., 2018; Trigka & Dritsas, 2022). CRNs enable devices to intelligently sense and adapt to the surrounding radio environment, dynamically adjusting transmission parameters to avoid interference and improve communication efficiency. DSA, on the other hand, facilitates the dynamic allocation of unused spectrum, enhancing spectrum utilization and reducing congestion.
Furthermore, data security and privacy are paramount concerns in real-time irrigation systems. The sensitive nature of agricultural data, such as crop yields and farm management practices, necessitates robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches (Gupta et al., 2020). Implementing secure communication protocols, authentication mechanisms, and encryption techniques is essential to protect data integrity and ensure the trustworthiness of the system.
Investigating Data Optimization Techniques
To enhance the efficiency and reliability of real-time data transmission in automated irrigation systems, researchers have explored a range of data optimization techniques. Data compression techniques aim to reduce the size of data packets transmitted over the network, minimizing bandwidth requirements and improving transmission speed (Rady et al., 2020; Karim et al., 2023). Lossless compression algorithms, such as Huffman coding and LZW, preserve data integrity while effectively reducing data size, ensuring that no information is lost during transmission (Cui, 2023). Lossy compression algorithms, such as JPEG and MP3, offer higher compression ratios but introduce a controlled level of data loss, which may be acceptable for certain applications where some loss of precision is tolerable (Karim et al., 2023). The choice between lossless and lossy compression depends on the specific application and the trade-off between data size and accuracy.
Data aggregation techniques provide another effective approach to optimize data transmission. By aggregating multiple sensor readings into a single representative value, such as average soil moisture or temperature, the number of transmissions can be significantly reduced, conserving bandwidth and energy resources (Cui, 2023). This is particularly beneficial in large-scale irrigation systems where numerous sensors are deployed across vast areas, generating substantial amounts of data. Additionally, data filtering techniques play a crucial role in improving data quality and reliability. Kalman filters and particle filters can effectively remove noise and outliers from sensor data, ensuring that only accurate and relevant information is transmitted and used for decision-making (Cui, 2023). This is essential for preventing erroneous data from influencing irrigation decisions and potentially leading to suboptimal water management.
Sensor calibration, drift correction, and fault detection are essential for maintaining data accuracy and reliability (Dos Santos et al., 2023). Regular calibration ensures that sensors provide accurate measurements over time, while drift correction techniques account for gradual changes in sensor readings due to environmental factors or aging. Fault detection mechanisms can identify and address sensor malfunctions or anomalies, preventing erroneous data from influencing irrigation decisions and potentially harming crops or wasting water.
Addressing the Challenges
Effectively addressing the challenges in real-time data transmission requires a multifaceted approach that encompasses environmental, technical, and data-related considerations. Implementing robust and adaptive communication protocols is crucial for overcoming interference and signal degradation caused by weather conditions and physical obstacles. Selecting appropriate protocols, such as LoRa or ZigBee, with suitable range and penetration capabilities can ensure reliable data transmission in challenging agricultural environments (Motamedi & Villányi, 2022). Additionally, employing techniques like frequency hopping and error correction codes can further improve communication resilience and mitigate data loss.
Optimizing network architecture is another key consideration. Deploying a distributed network architecture with edge and fog computing capabilities can significantly enhance data processing and transmission efficiency (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2019). Edge devices can perform initial data processing and aggregation tasks, reducing the amount of data transmitted to the cloud and minimizing latency, while fog nodes can provide additional processing power and storage closer to the data source, enhancing scalability and reliability. This distributed approach alleviates the burden on the central cloud server and allows for more responsive and efficient irrigation management.
Data optimization techniques play a vital role in reducing bandwidth requirements and improving transmission efficiency. The choice of data compression, aggregation, and filtering techniques should be tailored to the specific requirements of the irrigation system, considering factors such as data type, accuracy needs, and available bandwidth. By carefully selecting and implementing these techniques, the overall performance and effectiveness of real-time irrigation systems can be significantly enhanced, leading to more sustainable water management practices and improved agricultural productivity.
By addressing these challenges and implementing appropriate solutions, real-time data transmission can become a reliable and efficient component of automated irrigation systems, contributing to the overall goal of achieving sustainable and productive agriculture in the face of growing food demands and water scarcity.

3.6. IoT Network Architectures and Variable Rate Irrigation (VRI) for Real-Time Irrigation
Real-time irrigation management systems heavily rely on the efficient and reliable transmission of data from sensors and weather stations to the cloud for processing and decision-making. However, agricultural environments present unique challenges to wireless communication, including adverse weather conditions, physical obstacles, and the limitations of wireless technologies. These challenges necessitate robust and adaptive solutions to ensure the consistent and timely flow of data, enabling truly autonomous irrigation scheduling.
Environmental factors, such as heavy rain, fog, and strong winds, can significantly disrupt wireless communication by attenuating or even blocking radio signals, leading to data loss and compromised system performance (Ed-daoudi et al., 2023; Jukan et al., 2017; Yi & Ji, 2014; Zhang, Chang & Baoguo, 2018). Dense vegetation, buildings, and uneven terrain create further complications by causing multipath propagation and shadowing effects (Yim et al., 2018; Gautam and Pagay, 2020). The study by Yim et al. (2018) on LoRa networks in a tree farm environment exemplifies these challenges, revealing reduced communication range and data reliability compared to theoretical expectations. This underscores the need for carefully selecting and optimizing communication protocols and network parameters to ensure reliable data transmission in such environments.
The study by Guzinski et al. (2014a) using a modified TSEB model further highlights the importance of high-resolution data in accurately capturing the spatial and temporal dynamics of energy fluxes influenced by environmental factors. This emphasizes the need for advanced data acquisition and processing techniques that can effectively represent the complexities of agricultural settings.
The limitations of traditional wireless communication technologies, such as limited range and network congestion, pose additional challenges for large-scale agricultural operations. Long-distance data transmission can be hindered by range limitations, while network congestion arising from numerous sensors transmitting concurrently can lead to delays and data loss, hindering real-time decision-making (Hameed et al., 2020). Addressing these challenges requires the exploration of advanced networking technologies that can optimize spectrum utilization, mitigate interference, and improve reliability and efficiency.
Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) and Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) offer promising solutions for optimizing wireless communication in agricultural settings. CRNs empower devices with the ability to intelligently sense and adapt to the surrounding radio environment, dynamically adjusting transmission parameters to avoid interference and improve communication efficiency (Righi et al., 2017; Shafi et al., 2018; Trigka & Dritsas, 2022). Research has explored the potential of CRNs in predicting Radio Frequency (RF) power to avoid noisy channels and optimize spectrum utilization (Iliya et al., 2014; Iliya et al., 2014). These studies demonstrate the effectiveness of combining optimization algorithms with artificial neural networks (ANNs) to enhance the accuracy and generalization of RF power prediction, enabling CRNs to make informed decisions about channel selection and avoid interference.
DSA complements CRN technology by dynamically allocating unused spectrum, further enhancing spectrum utilization and reducing congestion (Shi et al., 2023). The numerical model developed by Shi et al. (2023) showcases the potential of CRNs and DSA for optimizing wireless communication in challenging environments.
The integration of CRNs and DSA into the IoT network architecture requires careful consideration of spectrum sensing techniques, network topology, and data security. Research on cooperative spectrum sensing suggests that distributed approaches, where sensor nodes collaborate and share information, can significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of spectrum sensing, particularly in dynamic environments (Trigka and Dritsas, 2022; Khalid & Yu, 2019). This collaborative approach enables a more comprehensive understanding of the radio environment and facilitates the identification of available frequency bands for data transmission.
The choice of network topology also impacts the performance and scalability of CRN-based irrigation systems. Mesh networks, where sensor nodes are interconnected and relay data for each other, offer enhanced resilience and coverage compared to star topologies where nodes communicate directly with a central gateway (Akyildiz & Vuran, 2010). However, mesh networks can be more complex to manage and may introduce additional routing overhead. The trade-off between network resilience and complexity needs to be carefully evaluated to select the most appropriate topology for a specific agricultural setting.
Data security and privacy are paramount concerns in IoT-based irrigation systems due to the sensitive nature of agricultural data (Gupta et al., 2020). Implementing secure communication protocols, authentication mechanisms, and encryption techniques is essential for protecting data integrity and ensuring system trustworthiness. Research on secure spectrum leasing and resource allocation algorithms for CR-WSN-based irrigation systems has demonstrated the potential of these technologies for enhancing security and efficiency (Hassan, 2023; Afghah et al., 2018).
In conclusion, the development of effective and reliable real-time irrigation management systems requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the challenges of data transmission in agricultural environments. The integration of robust and adaptive communication protocols, optimized network architectures, and advanced networking technologies like CRNs and DSA, along with a focus on data security and privacy, can contribute significantly to achieving the goal of autonomous and efficient irrigation scheduling.
4. AUTOMATED DATA PROCESSING IN THE CLOUD
4.1. Data Quality and Preprocessing
Data quality is paramount in automated irrigation systems as it directly influences the effectiveness of decision-making and water use efficiency. Issues like missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers arising from sensor malfunctions, environmental interference, or network problems (Lv et al., 2023) can significantly impact the performance of machine learning models used for irrigation scheduling and management.
Real-time data cleaning techniques are essential for addressing these challenges. Kalman filtering proves particularly effective in handling missing values and correcting erroneous readings by recursively estimating the system's state based on previous measurements and current sensor data, taking into account noise and uncertainty (Kim et al., 2020). Moving average techniques, by averaging consecutive data points, provide a more stable representation of the underlying trend, filtering out short-term fluctuations (Chhetri, 2023). For outlier detection, adaptive thresholding methods offer a dynamic approach, adjusting thresholds based on the statistical properties of the data to effectively identify anomalies and minimize false positives (Bah et al., 2021). These techniques are crucial in maintaining the integrity of real-time data streams and ensuring the accuracy of subsequent analyses.
Adaptive data preprocessing is essential for managing the diversity of data sources and formats commonly found in irrigation systems. Data normalization techniques, such as min-max scaling or z-score normalization, ensure that all features contribute equally to the analysis by transforming data values to a common scale (Pradal et al., 2016). This is crucial for preventing features with larger values from dominating the analysis and ensuring that all features are given equal consideration. Similarly, feature scaling methods, like standardization or normalization, optimize the range of feature values to improve the performance and convergence of machine learning models (Tortorici et al., 2024). By scaling features to a similar range, the influence of outliers is reduced, and the model's ability to learn from the data is enhanced.
Data fusion techniques play a critical role in integrating information from diverse sources, creating a more comprehensive and reliable dataset for irrigation management. Dempster-Shafer theory, a generalization of probability theory, allows for the expression of both uncertainty and the degree of conflict in evidence, making it suitable for fusing uncertain and conflicting data from heterogeneous sources (Sadiq and Rodriguez, 2004). This is particularly relevant in irrigation systems where data from different sensors may provide slightly different or even contradictory information due to sensor variations or environmental factors. Bayesian inference offers another powerful framework for combining information from multiple sources, updating the probability of a hypothesis as new evidence becomes available. By applying these techniques, data from soil moisture sensors, canopy temperature sensors, weather stations, and other sources can be integrated to provide a holistic understanding of crop water requirements and environmental conditions, leading to more informed and accurate irrigation decisions.
The impact of data quality extends beyond model accuracy to the robustness of machine learning models under varying conditions. Robust models should maintain consistent performance even when faced with data inconsistencies or unexpected situations. Techniques like data augmentation and domain adaptation can enhance model robustness by exposing the model to a wider range of data variations during training. Data augmentation involves generating additional training data by applying transformations or introducing noise to existing data, making the model more resilient to noise and variations in the real-world data. Domain adaptation techniques aim to adapt a model trained on one domain (e.g., a specific crop or geographic location) to perform well on another domain with different data characteristics. This is particularly relevant in irrigation management, where models may need to be applied to different crops, soil types, or climatic conditions.
The choice of data cleaning, preprocessing, and fusion techniques should be carefully considered based on the specific characteristics of the irrigation system and the available data. By selecting and implementing appropriate techniques, the accuracy, reliability, and robustness of machine learning models can be significantly improved, leading to more efficient and sustainable irrigation management practices.
4.2. Scalable and Autonomous Deployment using Containerization Strategies
The transition from data collection and transmission to efficient data processing requires a robust infrastructure capable of handling diverse workloads and data volumes. Containerization technologies, specifically Docker and Kubernetes, offer a promising solution for deploying and scaling data processing and machine learning modules within cloud environments like AWS, Azure, and GCP (Vargas-Rojas et al., 2024; Rosendo et al., 2022; Solayman & Qasha, 2023). Docker provides a standardized way to package applications and their dependencies into self-contained units known as containers, ensuring consistent and reproducible execution across different platforms (Rosendo et al., 2022). Kubernetes, acting as a container orchestrator, manages their deployment, scaling, and networking across a cluster of machines (Rosendo et al., 2022). This combination presents several advantages for automated irrigation management systems.
Firstly, containerization facilitates efficient resource utilization and scalability. By encapsulating applications and their dependencies, containers enable the isolation of resources and prevent conflicts between different modules (Vargas-Rojas et al., 2024; Solayman & Qasha, 2023). This isolation allows for the efficient allocation of resources, such as CPU, memory, and storage, to each container based on its specific needs. Kubernetes further enhances scalability by allowing for the automatic scaling of containers based on real-time demand, ensuring the system can adapt to varying workloads and data volumes, preventing bottlenecks, and ensuring responsiveness to changing conditions (Karamolegkos et al., 2023).
Secondly, containerization promotes portability and reproducibility. By packaging applications and their dependencies into a single unit, containers make it easy to move and deploy them across different cloud environments without the need for environment-specific configurations (Rosendo et al., 2022; Solayman & Qasha, 2023). This portability simplifies the development and deployment process, reducing the time and effort required to set up and manage the system. Additionally, containers ensure reproducibility by providing a consistent execution environment, regardless of the underlying infrastructure. This eliminates variability and ensures that the system will behave consistently across different deployments (Zhou et al., 2023).
Optimizing container orchestration and resource allocation is crucial to minimizing latency and maximizing throughput in real-time data processing pipelines. Techniques like auto-scaling and dynamic resource allocation play a critical role in this context (Hethcoat et al., 2024; Werner and Tai, 2023; Kumar et al., 2024). Auto-scaling automatically adjusts the number of container instances based on real-time demand, ensuring that sufficient resources are available to handle peak workloads while avoiding over-provisioning during periods of low demand (Hethcoat et al., 2024; Kumar et al., 2024). Dynamic resource allocation enables the fine-grained adjustment of resources allocated to each container based on its specific needs and the current workload (Werner and Tai, 2023). This ensures efficient resource allocation and provides each container with the necessary resources to perform its tasks effectively.
Performance monitoring tools, such as Kubernetes Metrics Server and Prometheus, are essential for gaining insights into the performance of containers and the overall system (Hethcoat et al., 2024; Kuity & Peddoju, 2023). These tools provide valuable data on key performance indicators, such as CPU and memory usage, network traffic, and application-specific metrics. By monitoring this data, administrators can identify bottlenecks, optimize resource allocation strategies, and continuously improve system performance (Hethcoat et al., 2024). This data-driven approach ensures that automated irrigation management systems can operate efficiently and reliably.
By integrating containerization technologies with optimization techniques and performance monitoring, automated irrigation management systems achieve the scalability, autonomy, and efficiency required for effective real-time data processing and decision-making. This approach facilitates a seamless and responsive system that can adapt to changing conditions and contribute to the overall goal of optimizing water resource management and increasing agricultural productivity.

4.3. Deploying ML Models for Data Processing
Transitioning from data collection, preprocessing, and transmission, the deployment of machine learning (ML) models marks a pivotal stage in the automated irrigation management pipeline. This stage entails utilizing cloud platforms to facilitate real-time data processing and inference, enabling data-driven decision-making for optimal irrigation management and ultimately contributing to fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.
Several architectures and frameworks exist for deploying ML models on cloud platforms, each offering unique advantages and catering to different requirements. TensorFlow Serving, for instance, provides a high-performance system specifically designed for serving TensorFlow models (Abadi et al., 2016). This framework enables efficient and scalable inference, making it suitable for real-time applications where low latency and high throughput are crucial. For instance, in a large-scale irrigation system with numerous sensors generating data continuously, TensorFlow Serving can efficiently handle the high volume of inference requests and provide timely predictions for irrigation scheduling. Similarly, Apache MXNet Model Server offers a flexible and efficient solution for deploying models trained with MXNet, supporting a wide range of deep learning models and inference backends (MXNet Developers, 2015). This versatility makes it suitable for complex irrigation systems that may utilize different types of ML models for various tasks, such as predicting crop water requirements, detecting plant stress, or forecasting weather conditions. ONNX Runtime, on the other hand, provides a cross-platform inference engine compatible with various ML frameworks, including PyTorch, TensorFlow, and MXNet (Microsoft, 2017). This versatility enables the deployment of models in diverse environments, facilitating interoperability and reducing the need for model conversion. For example, an irrigation system that uses models trained in different frameworks can utilize ONNX Runtime to deploy them on a single platform without the need for time-consuming and error-prone model conversion processes.
Choosing the appropriate architecture or framework depends on several factors, including the specific ML framework used for model training, the desired level of performance and scalability, and the need for cross-platform compatibility. For instance, if the primary concern is low latency and high throughput for real-time inference, TensorFlow Serving might be the optimal choice for TensorFlow models. However, if flexibility and support for various deep learning models are required, Apache MXNet Model Server could be more suitable. In cases where cross-platform compatibility is essential, ONNX Runtime offers a versatile solution.
Once the ML model is deployed, optimizing its performance and resource utilization becomes crucial for ensuring the efficiency of integrated end-to-end automated irrigation systems. Model compression techniques, such as pruning and quantization, offer effective methods for reducing the size and computational requirements of ML models without compromising accuracy (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). Pruning involves eliminating unnecessary connections or neurons from the model, effectively streamlining its structure and reducing computational complexity. This can be particularly beneficial for deep learning models, which often have a large number of parameters and can be prone to overfitting. By removing redundant or less important connections, pruning can improve modelgeneralizability and reduce inference time. Quantization, on the other hand, involves reducing the precision of model parameters, typically from 32-bit floating-point numbers to lower-precision formats such as 8-bit integers. This reduction in precision leads to smaller model sizes and faster inference speeds, making it particularly beneficial for resource-constrained environments or real-time applications. For instance, in edge computing scenarios where ML models are deployed on devices with limited computational resources, quantization can enable efficient inference without sacrificing accuracy.
Furthermore, hardware acceleration through the utilization of GPUs or TPUs can significantly enhance model performance by leveraging specialized hardware designed for parallel processing (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). GPUs, with their massive parallelism and high memory bandwidth, excel at accelerating matrix operations and convolutions, which are fundamental computations in many deep learning models. This acceleration can significantly reduce inference time and enable real-time processing of sensor data for timely irrigation decisions. TPUs, specifically designed for deep learning workloads, offer even greater performance and energy efficiency for specific model architectures. These hardware accelerators can drastically reduce inference time, enabling near real-time decision-making and enhancing the responsiveness of automated irrigation systems. For example, in a scenario where immediate response to changing weather conditions or soil moisture levels is critical, hardware acceleration can ensure that irrigation decisions are made and executed promptly.
In addition to model compression and hardware acceleration, distributed training techniques play a crucial role in optimizing the training process for large-scale ML models. Techniques such as Horovod and BytePS enable the distribution of training across multiple machines, effectively parallelizing the process and reducing training time (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). This is particularly beneficial for complex models with a large number of parameters or when dealing with large datasets. By leveraging distributed training, irrigation management systems can train more sophisticated models and improve their predictive capabilities, leading to more accurate and efficient irrigation decisions. For instance, a system that utilizes a deep learning model with millions of parameters can benefit from distributed training to reduce training time from days to hours, enabling faster model iteration and improvement.
Integrating the deployed ML models with other components of the automated irrigation management pipeline is essential for achieving a fully autonomous and cohesive system and addressing the need for seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system. Standardized protocols, such as MQTT and CoAP, provide lightweight and efficient communication channels for exchanging data between these components (Poojara et al., 2023; Jimenez et al., 2020a; Gour et al., 2023). MQTT, with its publish-subscribe architecture, enables real-time data streaming and event-driven communication, making it suitable for transmitting sensor data, control signals, and inference results (Raikar & M, 2023). This enables the ML model to receive real-time updates on soil moisture, weather conditions, and plant health, allowing for dynamic adjustments to irrigation schedules based on the latest data. CoAP, designed for constrained devices and low-power networks, offers a web-transfer protocol for resource-constrained environments, enabling efficient communication between sensors, actuators, and the ML models (Raikar & M, 2023). This is particularly relevant in situations where sensors or actuators have limited processing power or battery life, as CoAP minimizes communication overhead and energy consumption. Additionally, RESTful APIs provide a standardized interface for accessing and controlling the ML models, enabling seamless integration with other software components and facilitating system management and monitoring (Wang et al., 2022). This allows for easy integration with existing farm management systems or third-party applications, creating a unified platform for comprehensive irrigation management.4.4. Online Learning in the Cloud
The complexities of real-time data processing in irrigation management necessitate the exploration of advanced techniques to continuously learn and adapt to the dynamic nature of agricultural environments. Online learning algorithms offer a promising solution, enabling the continuous update and improvement of machine learning models based on incoming real-time data. This adaptability is crucial for addressing the challenges of changing environmental conditions, such as weather patterns and crop growth stages, and optimizing irrigation decision-making to enhance water usage efficiency and crop productivity.
Several online learning algorithms have demonstrated potential for real-time data processing and model adaptation in the context of irrigation management. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) facilitates the incremental update of model parameters with each new data point, allowing for efficient adaptation to changing data distributions (Bottou, 2010). This incremental learning process ensures that the model remains responsive to the latest conditions, minimizing the risk of outdated predictions and improving the accuracy of irrigation decisions. Passive-Aggressive algorithms, on the other hand, adjust model parameters only when a misclassification occurs, providing a computationally efficient approach for handling large data streams (Crammer et al., 2006). These algorithms offer a robust approach to handling noisy data, a common challenge in real-world sensor readings, by making small adjustments only when the model's prediction deviates significantly from the actual value (Fei et al., 2019). Online Random Forests extend the concept of random forests to the online setting, enabling the incremental construction and update of decision trees as new data arrives (Saffari et al., 2009). The continuous evolution of the ensemble ensures that the model remains relevant to the changing environment, capturing intricate relationships between variables and leading to more informed irrigation decisions.
Research in various domains highlights the importance of online learning for real-time data stream analytics. Snyder et al. (2020) explored the application of online learning techniques for identifying relevant tweets in real-time, improving situational awareness for first responders. The proposed interactive learning framework allows users to continuously label the relevance of incoming tweets, enabling the real-time refinement of the underlying machine learning model. This user-guided approach aligns well with the dynamic nature of irrigation management, where models need to continuously adjust to varying environmental conditions and crop water requirements. Similarly, research in the field of cyber-physical systems (CPS) underscores the need for online learning algorithms to effectively extract insights and knowledge from continuously generated data streams (Fei et al., 2019). These capabilities are crucial for enabling feedback loops between physical processes and cyber elements, facilitating the integration and optimization of CPS in irrigation management systems.
To implement online learning in cloud-based irrigation management systems, various architectures and frameworks can be considered. Apache Spark Streaming, Apache Flink, and AWS Kinesis provide scalable and fault-tolerant platforms for processing real-time data streams, allowing for the development of online learning pipelines that continuously ingest and analyze data to update machine learning models (Zaharia et al., 2012; Carbone et al., 2015; Amazon Web Services, 2023). These frameworks leverage serverless computing paradigms, automatically scaling resources based on the volume and velocity of incoming data, ensuring efficient resource utilization and responsiveness to fluctuations in demand (Fei et al., 2019).
Effectively managing the exploration-exploitation trade-off is crucial for optimizing online learning in irrigation management. Techniques such as Multi-armed bandits (Sutton & Barto, 2018), Bayesian optimization (Shahriari et al., 2016), and Reinforcement Learning (RL) (Sutton & Barto, 2018) can be employed to balance the allocation of resources between exploring new irrigation strategies and exploiting the current best-performing approaches. These techniques enable the identification of optimal irrigation policies, adapting to changing environmental conditions and maximizing long-term rewards.
In conclusion, online learning techniques, coupled with scalable cloud-based architectures, offer a powerful solution for real-time data processing and continuous adaptation in irrigation management systems. By leveraging algorithms like SGD, Passive-Aggressive, and Online Random Forests, along with stream processing frameworks like Apache Spark Streaming, Apache Flink, and AWS Kinesis, irrigation management systems can effectively handle the complexities of real-time data, optimize water usage, and enhance crop productivity in the face of dynamic environmental conditions.

5. GENERATING AND APPLYING IRRIGATION INSIGHTS 
5.1. Real-Time Generation of Actionable Irrigation Insights
The transition from data collection and processing to actionable irrigation insights requires the extracting spatial features from images, allowing for the analysis of satellite or drone imagery to assess crop health, detect water stress, and provide insights into irrigation needs (Os deployment of advanced predictive models capable of generating precise and site-specific irrigation recommendations.roosh et al., 2016).
Furthermore, the integration Deep learning models, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and of data from diverse sources, including IoT sensors and cloud-based platforms, plays Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have demonstrated excellent performance in capturing complex relationships a critical role in enhancing the accuracy and resolution of real-time irrigation insights. Data fusion techniques, such as Kalman filtering, offer a robust approach for combining information between input variables and predicting crop water requirements (Keller, 2023; Naphade et al., 2022). These models can effectively from multiple sensors, accounting for noise and uncertainty, and providing a more comprehensive understanding of crop water requirements (Cohen et al., 2005; Mö handle the temporal dependencies present in time-series data, such as soil moisture andeller et al., 2007). By integrating data from soil moisture weather data, and learn to predict future water needs based on historical patterns and current sensors, weather stations, and remote sensing platforms, ML models can generate more accurate conditions. Ensemble methods, such as Random Forests, also offer a robust approach to and site-specific irrigation recommendations, leading to improved water use efficiency and crop productivity prediction by combining multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce the risk of overfitting.
The heterogeneity, uncertainty, and quality issues inherent in real-time data streams require careful consideration and the implementation of effective strategies to ensure the reliability of generated (Singh et al., 2016).
The integration of irrigation insights. Data preprocessing techniques, such as outlier detection and missing value imputation, IoT sensor data with cloud-based data sources is crucial for enhancing the accuracy and resolution of irrigation insights. IoT sensors, such as soil moisture probes and weather stations are essential for preparing the data for analysis and preventing erroneous data from influencing the model, provide real-time, localized data on crop and environmental conditions, while cloud's predictions (Fiksel, 2003). Additionally,-based sources, such as weather forecasts and satellite imagery, offer broader spatial and the selection of appropriate ML models and data fusion techniques should be tailored to the specific temporal perspectives (López-Morales et al., 2020). characteristics of the irrigation system and the available data to mitigate uncertainty and ensure the robustness Data fusion techniques, such as Kalman filtering, play a critical role in combining these of generated insights.
To address computational complexity and latency challenges in real-time irrigation insight generation, techniques such as edge computing, model compression, and hardware accelerators heterogeneous data sources to generate more accurate and comprehensive irrigation recommendations (Cohen et al., offer promising solutions. Edge computing enables the distribution of processing tasks closer to the data 2005; Möeller et al., 2007 source, reducing latency and enabling faster response times (Mishra, 20). By incorporating data from multiple sources, irrigation models can better account for spatial variability20; Zhang et al., 2020). Model compression techniques, such as pruning and quantization, can significantly reduce the size and computational requirements of in soil moisture, microclimate conditions, and crop water requirements, leading to more ML models without compromising accuracy, making them suitable for deployment on resource-constrained edge precise and efficient irrigation scheduling.
The seamless integration of ML-generated insights with IoT-enabled irrigation control systems requires the adoption of appropriate architectures and protocols that facilitate devices (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). Hardware lightweight, real-time communication. The Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT accelerators, such as GPUs and TPUs, provide specialized hardware designed for parallel processing) protocol and the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) are well-suited, enabling faster inference speeds and facilitating real-time data analysis (Premkumar for this purpose, offering efficient and reliable communication channels for exchanging data between sensors, & Sigappi, 2022). The combined utilization of these techniques can significantly improve the efficiency and responsiveness of real-time irrigation insight generation, contributing actuators, and ML models (Muangprathub et al., 2019; Osroosh et al., 2016). to the overall goal of achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.
The implementation MQTT's publish-subscribe architecture enables real-time data streaming and event- of these strategies and techniques for real-time generation of actionable irrigation insights provides a solid foundation for developing automated and data-driven irrigation management systems that can effectively addressdriven communication, while CoAP's lightweight design and low overhead make it suitable the global food challenge by optimizing water resource utilization and maximizing agricultural productivity.
for resource-constrained devices and low-bandwidth networks. By utilizing these protocols, irrigation systems can achieve seamless integration between ML models and IoT devices, enabling the automated application of irrigation insights based on real-time data and predictions.
Industry-leading products and services for smart irrigation demonstrate the practical application of these technologies. Smart irrigation controllers, such as Rachio, leverage weather data and soil moisture sensors to automatically adjust irrigation schedules based on real-time conditions, reducing water waste and promoting water conservation (Verdouw et al., 2023). Cloud-based irrigation management platforms, such as CropX, offer advanced analytics and decision support tools, providing farmers with insights into crop water requirements, soil health, and irrigation performance (Weikmann et al., 2023). These platforms often incorporate machine learning algorithms to generate predictive models and provide farmers with data-driven recommendations for optimizing irrigation strategies.
The analysis of these products and services highlights the growing trend toward data-driven, automated irrigation management. By integrating IoT, machine learning, and cloud computing, these solutions enable farmers to make more informed and efficient irrigation decisions, contributing to the overall goal of achieving sustainable and productive agriculture.

Abstract In this paper, an automatic Smart Irrigation Decision Support System, SIDSS, is proposed to manage irrigation in agriculture. Our system estimates the weekly irrigations needs of a plantation, on the basis of both soil measurements and climatic variables gathered by several autonomous nodes deployed in field. This enables a closed loop control scheme to adapt the decision support system to local perturbations and estimation errors. Two machine learning techniques, PLSR and ANFIS, are proposed as reasoning engine of our SIDSS. Our approach is validated on three commercial plantations of citrus trees located in the South-East of Spain. Performance is tested against decisions taken by a human expert.

Introduction The efficient use of water in agriculture is one of the most important agricultural challenges that modern technologies are helping to achieve. In arid and semiarid regions, the differences between precipitation and irrigation water requirements are so big that irrigation management is a priority for sustainable and economically profitable crops (IDAE, 2005). To accomplish this efficient use, expert agronomists rely on information from several sources (soil, plant and atmosphere) to properly manage the irrigation requirements of the crops (Puerto et al., 2013). This information is defined by a set of variables, which can be measured using sensors, that are able to characterise the water status of the plants and the soil in order to obtain their water requirements. While meteorological variables are representative of a large area and can be easily measured by a single sensor for a vast land extension, soil and plant variables have a large spatial variability. Therefore, in order to use these parameters to effectively schedule the irrigation of the plants, multiple sensors are needed (Naor et al., 2001). Weather is one of the key factors being used to estimate the water requirements of the crops (Allen et al., 1998). Moreover, it is very frequent that public agronomic management organisms have weather stations spread around the different regions. These weather stations usually provide information of key variables for the agriculture like reference evapotranspiration (ET0) or the Vapour Pressure Deficit (VPD) that are of great importance to calculate the water requirements of the crops. Using variables related to the climate is the most common approach to create crop water requirement models (Jensen et al., 1970, Smith, 2000, Zwart and Bastiaanssen, 2004). Using these models, based on solely meteorological variables, a decision-making system can determine how a given crop will behave (Guariso et al., 1985). However, not all the regions have access to an extensive network of weather stations or they may not be nearby a given crop, thus the local micro-climates are not taken into account if only these parameters are used. Besides, irrigation models based only on climate parameters rely on an open loop structure. This means that the model is subject to stochastic events and it may not be able to correct the local perturbations that can occur when a unexpected weather phenomenon occurs (for instance irrigate the crop when it’s already raining) (Dutta et al., 2014, Giusti and Marsili-Libelli, 2015). Finally, monitoring other variables, such as hydrodynamic soil factors or water drainage, might increase the chances that the irrigation predicted by the models is properly used by the plants (Kramer and Boyer, 1995). Therefore, the usage of sensors that measures the soil water status is a key complement to modulate the water requirements of the crops. Soil variables, such as soil moisture content or soil matric potential, are considered by many authors as crucial part of scheduling tools for managing irrigation (Cardenas-Lailhacar and Dukes, 2010, Soulis et al., 2015). The information from soil sensors can be used to create better decision models with closed loop structures that adapt to weather and soil perturbations (Cardenas-Lailhacar and Dukes, 2010, Soulis et al., 2015). This practice, however, has not been widely adopted due to the technological limitations of available soil sensors, which required measured information to be registered and stored, traditionally using wired dataloggers, and limiting the installation flexibility and the real time interaction. This has changed recently with new generation sensors and sensor networks that are more versatile and suited to the agricultural environment (Navarro-Hellín et al., 2015). Combining climate and soil variables has therefore potential to properly manage irrigation in a more efficient way than other traditional approaches. However, it also entails a series of challenges related with the increased amount of data flow, its analysis and its use to create effective models, in particular when data provided by different sources may seem contradictory and/or redundant. Traditionally, this analysis and modelling is performed by a human expert who interprets the different variables. The need of a human agronomist expert is required due to the complexity introduced by the soil spatial variability, crop species variability and their irrigation requirements over the growth cycle (Maton et al., 2005), which require comparing crops models and local context variables to determine the specific water requirements to achieve a certain goal at a particular location. The complexity of this problem and the different sources of variability makes than even the best model may deviate from the prediction, which favours the use of close loop control systems combining soil and climate sensors over open loop systems as a way to compensate possible deviations in future predictions. Human expertise has been proved effective to assist irrigation management but it is not scalable and available to every field, farm and crop and it is slow in the analysis of the data and real time processing. Instead, applying machine learning techniques to replace the manual models and to assist expert agronomists allows the viability of creating automatic Irrigation Decision Support System. Machine learning techniques have been used previously to estimate relevant parameters of the crop (Sreekanth et al., 2015). Giusti and Marsili-Libelli(2015) present a fuzzy decision systems to predict the volumetric water content of the soil based on local climate data. Adeloye et al. (2012), proposed the use of unsupervised artificial neural networks (ANN) to estimate the evapotranspiration also based on weather information solely. King and Shellie (2016) used NN modelling to estimate the lower threshold temperature (Tnws) needed to calculate the crop water stress index for wine grapes. In Campos et al. (2016) the authors presented a new algorithm designed to estimate the total available water in the soil root zone of a vineyard crop, using only SWC sensors, which are very dependent of the location. Taking advantage of the soil information, Valdés-Vela et al., 2015, Abrisqueta et al., 2015 incorporates the volumetric soil water content, manually collected with a neutron probe, to agro-meteorological data. This information is then fed into a fuzzy logic system to estimate the stem water potential. Other approaches in the literature also make use of machine learning techniques – such as principal component analysis, unsupervised clustering, and ANN – to estimate the irrigation requirements in crops. However they do not specify the quantity of water needed (Dutta et al., 2014), they reduce the prediction to true or false, and/or they are based on open loop structures (Giusti and Marsili-Libelli, 2015, Jensen et al., 1970, Smith, 2000, Zwart and Bastiaanssen, 2004), only considering the weather information and, therefore, unable to correct deviations from their predictions. This paper proposes an automated decision support system to manage the irrigation on a certain crop field, based on both climatic and soil variables provided by weather stations and soil sensors. As discussed, we postulate that the usage of machine learning techniques with the weather and soil variables is of great importance and can help to achieve a fully automated close loop system able to precisely predict the irrigation needs of a crop. Our presented system is evaluated by comparing it against the irrigations reports provided by an agronomist specialist during a complete season in different fields. 2. System structure An irrigation advice system is based on the concept of predicting the waters needs of the crops in order to irrigate them properly. Traditionally this decision has been taken by an experienced farmer or an expert agricultural technician. Fig. 1 shows the flow diagram of which the proposed system is based. Download : Download high-res image (82KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Flow diagram of the proposed system. In this schema, an expert agronomist is in charge of analysing the information from different sources: Weather stations located near the crops that collect meteorological data, Crop and Soil characteristics (type, age, size, cycle, etc.) and Soil sensors installed in the crop fields. The expert analyses the information to provide an irrigation report, which indicates the amount of water needed to irrigate properly the crops in the upcoming week. To make this decision making process manageable, the information needed to create the irrigation report on the next week is only the information of the current week. Based on this concept, our Smart Irrigation Decision Support System (SIDSS) is proposed. In order to evaluate the performance and validity of our approach, the decision system will use the same information used by the expert agronomist and will output the water requirements for the upcoming week. This will ensure a fair comparison between the decisions taken by a human expert and the SIDSS. To accomplish this, the machine learning system must be trained with historical data and irrigations reports of the agronomist, using the irrigation decisions taken in these reports as the groundtruth of the system. The aim of the system is to be as accurate as possible to this groundtruth. Several machine learning techniques were applied and evaluated to achieve the best performance. Fig. 2 shows a diagram of the SIDSS. Download : Download high-res image (103KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Training inputs and targets of SIDSS. The Irrigation Decision System is composed of three main components: a collection device that gathers information from the soil sensors, weather stations that provide agrometeorological information and the SIDSS that, when trained correctly, is able to predict the irrigation requirements of the crops for the incoming week. Table 1 shows the set of possible input variables of the system. Table 1. Set of possible input variables of the system.

Collection device and soil sensors The information from the soil sensors is gathered using our own developed device that has been proved to be completely functional for irrigation management in different crops and conditions (Navarro-Hellín et al., 2015). This device is wireless, equipped with a GSM/GPRS modem, and is completely autonomous, so that the installation procedures are accessible to any farmer. Fig. 3 shows the collection device installed in a lemon crop field located in the South-East of Spain. Download : Download high-res image (302KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Device installed in a lemon crop field. The device allows to fully configure the recording rates of all the embedded sensors. In our experiments, a sampling rate of 15 min was set, since this gives a good balance between providing enough information to support a correct agronomic decision and maintaining the autonomy of the device with the equipped solar panel and battery (López Riquelme et al., 2009, Navarro-Hellín et al., 2015. The information is received, processed and stored in a relational database. 2.1.1. Soil sensors The soil control variables used to provide SIDSS with relevant information are matric potential (Ψm) and volumetric soil water content (θv), which are common in irrigation management (Jones, 2004). By using these variables, the irrigation can be scheduled for maintaining soil moisture conditions equivalent or close to field capacity in order to satisfy the required crop water requirements. Likewise, they can be used to maintain soil water content or soil matric potential under certain reference values proper of regulated deficit irrigation strategies. Both Ψm and θv are used to decide the irrigation frequency and to adjust the gross irrigation doses. Soil matric potential was measured with MPS-2 sensors (Decagon devices, Inc., Pullman, WA 99163 – USA), while volumetric soil water content was measured with both 10-HS (Decagon devices, Inc., Pullman, WA 99163 – USA) and Enviroscan (Sentek Pty. Ltd., Adelaide, Australia) sensors. Besides both previous soil sensors, another sensor is used. A pluviometer (Rain-o173-matic small, Pronamic Ltd., Ringkøbing, Denmark) was used under the dripper to provide accurate estimation of the amount of water applied and the irrigation run time. The information provided by this sensor was used to ensure that the farmer is following the instruction of the agronomic reports provided by the expert. Table 2 summarises the variables measured by the soils sensors. Table 2. Soil sensors technical information.

Weather stations Experiments took place in the Region of Murcia, Spain. In this region, there is a network of 45 agro-meteorological stations located in irrigated areas, the Agricultural Information Network System of Murcia (SIAM), funded by the EU and installed to help estimate the reference evapotranspiration (ET0) and the irrigation needs of crops after a severe drought between 1979 and 1985. The variables measured by the stations are the following: Temperature (T), Relative humidity (RH), Global radiation (GR), Wind speed (WS), Rainfall (RF), Dew point (DP), Vapour Pressure Deficit (VPD). These variables, measured by the different stations, are publicly available and can be downloaded from the SIAM website (SIAM, 2015). The weather stations are tested and calibrated periodically according to the manufacturer’s specifications. The amount of water required to compensate the evapotranspiration loss from the cropped field is defined as crop water requirement. Therefore, knowing the reference crop evapotranspiration is of key importance to estimate the crop’s water requirements. Using the FAO Penman–Monteith formulation (Allen et al., 1998), the daily reference crop evapotranspiration (ET0) can be calculated by means of the weather information. The crop evapotranspiration under standard condition (ETc) can be calculated using the single crop coefficient approach shown below: (1) where Kc is the crop coefficient and depends on multiple factors, namely, the crop type, climate, crop evaporation and soil growth stages. 2.3. Smart Irrigation Decision Support System The decision support system is the component in charge of taking the final decision on the amount of water to be irrigated, or equivalently, the number of minutes to irrigate considering constant water flow. This decision is taken automatically on the basis of the information provided by the sensors and the usage of machine learning and pattern recognition techniques. The aim of this component, therefore, is to mimic a human expert in the decision making process of weekly optimising the irrigation, which could assist the farmer. Applying machine learning techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) allow us to visualise the information to perform an initial exploratory analysis. Fig. 4 shows the LDA of the input, array containing the sensorial variables, and output, the estimated irrigation time need, used in the system. The output was divided in classes (18), each one representing the weekly irrigation time by increments of 150 min, from 0 to 2700 min. From this figure, it can be noticed that discrete classification in classes will be hard to accomplish due to the high number of classes necessary to precisely quantise the irrigation estimation. This is due to the fact that the variable to estimate – either the amount of water or the watering time-has an intrinsic continuous nature, since the expected output can take any real value between 0 and infinity. Therefore, conventional classifiers aiming categorical outputs – such as LDA (Fisher, 1938), SVM (Belousov et al., 2002), and ANN are not optimal for this application. Instead, methodologies based on regression (Wold et al., 1984), and/or fuzzy logic (Zadeh et al., 1996) allow us to estimate a more suited continuous variable. Download : Download high-res image (124KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Linear discriminant analysis for 18 irrigation time intervals. In this section, we propose two different techniques, each belonging to one of the previous families, to estimate the weekly required amount of water. As described in the introduction and experimental sections, both modelling techniques require a supervised training set in order to learn the irrigation model. 2.3.1. Partial least square regression Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR) (Wold et al., 2001) is a statistical method that seeks the fundamental relations between predictor and response variables. Predictor variables, X, are defined as the observable variables that can be measured and input into the decision system. Response variable Y are the outputs or estimates that must be deducted from the input. The relationship between both variable sets, and linear multivariate regression model, is found by projecting both predicted and observable variables into a new space, where latent variables are estimated to model the covariance structure between the predictor space and the observation space. This PLSR model is developed from a training set D = {X, Y} of S samples, which is composed of the predictor matrix X = [x1, … , xi, … , xS]T and the response matrix Y = [y1, … , yi, … , yS]T. xi is a column vector of K elements, that can contain all the sensor and weather variables measured at a given week i: (2) and yi is another column vector of M elements, containing the corresponding variables to be estimated at that week i. Since in our application this is only the irrigation time recommended at that week, yi is reduced to a scalar and M = 1: PLSR constructs new predictor latent variables, known as components, which are linear combinations of the original predictor observable variables. These components are created to explain the observed variability in the original predictor variables, while simultaneously considering the response variable. That is, the estimated latent variables are linear combinations of predictor variables that have higher covariance with Y. Using the latent variables leads to a regression models able to fit the response variable with fewer components. The PLSR learning model can be expressed as: (3) (4) where T and U are the projections – aka scores – of X and Y into a smaller L-dimensional latent space respectively, P and Q are the orthogonal projection matrices – aka loading matrices – and E and G the error residuals. P and Q can be obtained by eigendecomposition of the original matrices. Since the X-scores T are meant to be good predictors of Y, it can be approximated that: (5) Being F a new residual. This reduces the problem to find a set of weights W such that T = X ∗ W predicts X and Y reasonably well. As mentioned, these orthogonal coefficients should maximise the correlation between X and Y while explaining the variance of X: (6) P and Q can be solved by applying a Least Square Estimator (LSE) so: (7) (8) Finally, by rewriting the previous equation, it can be derived that: (9) Being B the PLSR regression coefficients. Once these coefficients have been learned, responses y∗ for new observation x∗ can be estimated by applying the learning model: (10) assuming an estimation error f. We favour the use of PLSR among other regression techniques due to its suitability when the number of predictors is bigger than the number of response variables, the responses are noisy and there is a high probability of having multicollinearity among the predictor variables. The multicollinear phenomenon happens when those variable are highly correlated, due to redundancy between sensors and or between meteorological factors. As it can be noticed, all these factors appear in our irrigation problem. 2.3.2. Adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS) (Jang, 1993) is a fuzzy inference system for systematically generating fuzzy rules from a given input/output D dataset. This machine learning technique combines advantages from fuzzy logic and artificial neural networks. On the one hand, it allows us to represent an element not only into categories but also into a certain degree of membership functions, which allows mimicking the characteristics of human reasoning and decision making. On the one hand, it can be trained and so can self-improve in order to adjust the membership functions parameters directly from data (Wang et al., 2006). The ANFIS architecture consists in a five-layer feedforward neural network (Fig. 5) whose parameters are updated using a combination of gradient descent and LSE in a two-pass learning algorithm. Download : Download high-res image (95KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Example of ANFIS architecture for a input x with K variables and a 1-variable output y. In a first forward pass step, neuron outputs are calculated layer by layer and some internal consequent parameters are identified by the least squares estimator (LSE) to obtain the final single output. The forward pass operation at layer 1 defines the fuzzy membership for each input variable X. Assuming a Gaussian distribution function , the output of this layer is given by: (11) Layer 2 is a multiplicative layer, which calculates the firing strength of the rules as a product of the previous membership grades. (12) Layer 3 is a normalising layer, where: (13) Layer 4 applies a node function: (14) where and are consequent parameters estimated using LSE. Finally, layer 5 is the output layer that provides the overall estimation y as a summation of all incoming signals. For the case M = 1, where only one output variable is estimated: (15) After the forward pass has been completed, an initial estimation is provided by the ANFIS network. Since initial premise parameters are initialised randomly, the initial estimation will differ greatly from the desired values Y. This error or difference between the desired output y and the estimated output for a given training sample {xi, yi} can be expressed as: (16) To correct this deviation, a second learning step, or backward pass, attempts to minimise the estimated error by modifying the value of the premise parameters until the desired and estimated outputs are similar. This process is performed using backpropagation, where the error is propagated back over the layers and decomposed into the different nodes using the chain rule. Gradient descend is used as optimisation technique to update the premise parameters while the consequent parameters are kept fixed until the next iteration. This double step learning process is repeated iteratively for every single sample in the training set until the estimated error is smaller than a given threshold, i.e. convergence is achieved, or a maximum number of iterations – epocs – are reached. The ANFIS implementation used in this work is taken from the Fuzzy logic toolbox (Inc, 2016), by Mathworks where the parameter Radii used to train was a scalar of value 0.75 and the average number of epochs used to train was 1500. 3. Experimental setup The system was evaluated in three commercial plantations of lemon trees in the Region of Murcia, located in the semiarid zone of the South-East of Spain where the water is very scarce and drip irrigation is commonly used. The irrigation criteria followed was to maximise the yield. Plantation 1. Fino lemon trees (Citrus limon L. Burm. Fil cv. 49) on Citrus macrophylla Wester, growing in a soil with a low water retention capacity. The soil is characterised by a deep and homogeneous sandy – clay – loam texture. The irrigation water had an electrical conductivity (EC) of 2200 μS cm−1. The orchard consist of 11 year old lemon trees with an average height of 3.5 m. Tree spacing was 7.0 m × 5.5 m, with an average ground coverage of about 47%. Two drip irrigation lines (0.8 m apart) were used for each tree row. There were 4 emitters (4 L h−1) on both sides of each tree. One sensor node was installed in the 5.5 ha orchard, with a soil matric potential sensor (MPS-2, Decagon devices, Inc., Pullman, WA 99163 – USA) at a depth of 30 cm and three soil moisture sensors at a depth of 20, 40 and 80 cm (Enviroscan, Sentek Pty. Ltd., Adelaide, Australia) located 20 cm from a representative dripper and 2.25 m from the trunk. According to the nearest weather station of SIAM, located about 5 km from the orchard, the climate was typically Mediterranean. Thus, over this period (2014), the annual rainfall for the area was 210 mm and ET0 was 1395 mm. The average wind speed was 1.66 m/s, generally light wind and sometimes moderate. Plantation 2 and 3. 40 and 35 year old lemon trees (C. limon L. Burm. Fil) cv. Fino and cv. Verna respectively, grafted on sour orange (Citrus aurantium L.), growing in a soil with a medium water retention capacity. The soil is clay sandy loam texture and the irrigation water had an electrical conductivity (EC) of 1600 μS cm−1 during all season except in summer which was of 2285 μS cm−1. The tree spacing was 7.0 m × 6.75 m and 6.75 m × 6.75 m and the average ground coverage about 57% and 50%, respectively. One drip irrigation line was used for each tree row. There were 8 and 6 emitters of 4 L h−1 per tree, respectively. One sensor node was installed in the Fino orchard (≈15 ha) and another in Verna orchard (≈23 ha), each with two soil matric potential sensor (MPS-2, Decagon devices, Inc., Pullman, WA 99163 – USA) at a depth of 25 and 45 cm and three soil moisture sensors at a depth of 25, 45 and 70 cm (10HS, Decagon devices, Inc., Pullman, WA 99163) located 20 cm from a representative dripper and the vertical canopy projection. According to the nearest SIAM’s weather station, located about 7 km from the orchards, the climate was also typically Mediterranean. Over this period (2014), the annual rainfall for the area was 150 mm and ET0 was 1250 mm. The average wind speed was 1.4 m/s, i.e. light wind generally. The decision of selecting these three plantations is based on the fact that all of them are mature lemon trees and therefore their water irrigation requirement differences depend mainly of environmental conditions (soil and atmosphere) rather than the plant. Besides, all the plantations use drip emitters of 4 L h−1 so estimating the irrigation runtime of the week instead of the water volume will be a correct approach. Drip irrigation provides a fixed volume of water per hour; the pressure is maintained using pressure compensating emitters. The Irrigation frequency is calculated taking into account that only a certain amount of water depletion is allowed before the next replenishment is scheduled. Thus, the run time (gross irrigation dose) is determined to be equivalent to the previous amount of water depletion. The experts only need to calculate the irrigation run time (minutes) and the number of watering times per week or day depending on the time of year or crop development stage. The main goal of the system, also reflected by the expert agronomist in his reports, is to maximise the yield (maximum production per crop surface) with an optimum water management. Since information from the weather stations, soil sensors and crops characteristics has different sampling periods, the first step is pre-process this information. After analysing several methods and time intervals it was decided that the best option was to calculate the week average value for each of the sensors or weather stations variable except for the rainfall where the total amount of rainfall during the week is used instead. The week average fits better than others method like the daily average due to the fact, that the irrigation reports from the expert agronomist are already fixed, limited and done weekly. Besides, adding more input will make the data sparser, making more difficult to find patterns in the feature space, requiring a higher amount of data to train the system accordingly. The input obtained will be a one dimensional vector xi for each week in which the columns are the different variables or inputs of our system. The target vector will be the water requirements of the crops in the following week yi. This information has been extracted from the agronomist expert weekly reports in order to be used as groundtruth for comparison as for supervising the learning process. Three datasets are available, each dataset represent a different plantation. Data was collected from January 2014 until June 2015. Each plantation dataset has 74 weeks of data, which makes a total of 224 weeks of data. To accomplish a proper analysis of the system, we have divided the experiment in two different scenarios. Both scenarios differ from the other on the training and testing split. Two machine learning methods are applied on each scenario, a method based on PLSR and a method based on ANFIS. The performances of both methods in the different scenarios are analysed. 4. Experimental results and discussion 4.1. Scenario 1 In this scenario, we aim to successfully predict the irrigation needs of one or several plantation, based on the information provided by the collection device and learned knowledge from a historical archive of the previous year irrigation reports. This is of obvious usefulness in real life. We will demonstrate this capability by predicting the irrigation needs of year 2015 for the three plantations based on the information of the year 2014. The training set is therefore composed by all 2014 weeks of data belonging the three plantations, while the test set is composed by all 2015 weeks belonging to the three plantations. The information given to the system, or input vector, is a critical part of the design. On the one hand using unnecessary features may make the system perform poorly due to redundant information and noise. On the other hand, using too few features may not provide all the required information. Therefore, among all the available features explained in Table 1, they will not all be necessary. Table 3 shows the features subsets selected for each test. Among all possible sets of features, only combinations with logical sense, according to an expert agronomist were chosen a priori for the different experiments. Performance of the different sets is shown in Fig. 6. Table 3. Features subset and variables associated.

Performance of the different sets of variables for linear regression and ANFIS. The set that accomplish the best performance for both methods is F6, with and error of 155.1 and 121.1 min week−1 for PLSR and ANFIS respectively. In order to put this error into context, it can be noticed that 2.5 extra hours of irrigation represent around 10% of the total time in summer months – and up to 20% in spring and autumn months, being 10% error considered as an acceptable error in agriculture (Bos et al., 2004). Therefore, this feature set F6 will be the input vector of the system. It can be noticed that including the rain as input of the system (F7), increases the error. In the Region of Murcia, the rainfall are extremely low (around 210 mm per year) and usually being concentrated in a few days of the year, being the weekly total rain in most cases 0. With this information only available for the year 2014, the system didn’t have enough information to be trained properly and developed in unpredictable results. However we understand that in other regions the rainfall could be really useful to increase the performance of the system. Besides, considering the water retention capabilities of the soil, part of the rainfalls would be considered in the next irrigation report. Fig. 7 shows the water irrigation pattern over time predicted by the PLSR and ANFIS respectively when using feature set 6.

Prediction of the water irrigation pattern using soil and weather information for the different plantations (Plantation 1: Week 1–24, Plantation 2: Week 25–48, Plantation 3: Week 49–72). The weekly errors for predicting the irrigation needs during the year 2015 in the three plantations are 155.1 and 121.1 min week−1 for PLSR and ANFIS respectively. The standard deviation for PLSR is 120.7. In the case of ANFIS, the standard deviation is 105.2. The total amount of time needed to irrigate the crops in the three plantations in 2015 is 65,641 min. ANFIS method estimates this value in 60,506 min and PLSR estimates 63,240 min. As conclusion, ANFIS performance is better than PLSR for each individual week water requirement estimation. However, PLSR estimation also follows the irrigation pattern accurately and estimates the total amount of water required more accurately over time than ANFIS, which seems to be more conservative in the water usage. Looking at the higher peaks of water requirement in the graphs, PLSR may overestimate the water needs while ANFIS is more accurate in general. It is important to note that in agronomy the most important point is not only the amount of water plants need but when they need it (Allen et al., 1998). Following this criterion, the performance of ANFIS is much better than PLSR for this scenario. Another factor that is important to analyse in this research is the use of soil sensors in addition to weather stations to close the loop. We consider that using this kind of sensors to estimate the water requirements of the crops improves the accuracy of the estimation and helps to deal with local disturbances. Since this is one of our main contributions and differences with other proposed automatic irrigation systems, a detailed analysis of the contribution of these variables is needed to validate our hypotheses and facilitate comparison with previous research systems. Therefore, the input vector was changed, using only weather information to train the system and predict the irrigation time. Table 4 shows the weekly average error for different sets of input vectors. Table 4. Summary of the performance of the different subsets.

Prediction of the water irrigation pattern using weather information for the different plantations (Plantation 1: Week 1–24, Plantation 2: Week 25–48, Plantation 3: Week 49–72). The error in PLSR using only weather information is 175.3 min week−1 with a standard deviation of 147.6. In the case of ANFIS, the error is 159.6 min week−1 with a standard deviation of 146.6. Although in general the shape of the graph is quite similar to the one using both soil and weather. The use of soil sensors gives a fine adjustment increasing the accuracy of the estimation for both PLSR and ANFIS reasoning engines. It can be concluded that a much better performance in the weekly irrigation estimation (around a 22% smaller weekly average error) is achieved when adding soils sensor information to the weather information. Next, a cross-validation strategy is applied to the scenario to validate how the results will generalise to an independent dataset. In cross validation, the complete dataset of the three plantations is divided in training and testing sets. The method used to cross-validate the information is Leave one out (LoO CV), a particular case of the Leave-p-out cross-validation (LpO CV). Kohavi, 1995, Picard and Cook, 1984 that involves using 1 observation as the testing set and the remaining observations as the training set. This process is repeated the number of samples times (n) changing the test sample each time to validate the system with all the samples. Cross validation method was used for both PLSR and ANFIS. Fig. 9 shows the results of this LoO Cross-Validation method for PLSR and ANFIS respectively using the set F6 as input vector.

Cross-validation LoO prediction for linear regression and ANFIS (Plantation 1: Weeks 1–52 and 157–180, Plantation 2: Weeks 53–104 and 181–204, Plantation 3: Weeks 105–156 and 205–229). The error in PLSR is 277.8 min week−1 with a standard deviation of 153.2. In the case of ANFIS, the error is 87.6 min week−1 with a standard deviation of 102.9. The total amount of time needed to irrigate the crops for the 189 weeks in the three plantations is 214,020 min. The ANFIS method estimates this value on 213,180 min and PLSR estimates 213,960 min. Table 5 summarises the result of the experiments. Table 5. Scenario 1 results summary. Results Average weekly error (min) With soil sensors No soil sensors Scenario 1 Predict 2015 PLSR 155.1 175.3 ANFIS 121.1 159.6 Cross-Validation PLSR 277.8 295.7 ANFIS 87.6 211.9 Similar conclusions are extracted using Cross-Validation. Both PLSR and ANFIS systems are really close to the groundtruth in the total amount of water estimated but it is clear that ANFIS performs much better than PLSR if we consider the weekly error. It is also confirmed that using soil sensors in addition to weather information results in a better performance for both ANFIS and PLSR methods. The improvement on ANFIS performance during cross validation is explained by the larger amount of training data regarding the “predict 2015” experiment. This behaviour is expected due to the nature of neural networks, which require large amount of data to be trained in comparison with other machine learning techniques and we predict than having a historical archive longer for training could results in a further improvement. Although we are validating our systems with the three plantations described before as case of study, in principle, our methodology has been designed to be independent of the crop, terrain and location of the plantation, aiming to propose a general close-loop automatic irrigation estimator. In practical terms, this means that to apply our system to new plantations, training data in the form of sensor and weather weekly data as well as irrigation reports provided by and expert agronomist for the new plantation will be needed. Since these reports can be expensive and compiling a substantial amount of weekly reports is time consuming and must be planned in advance, it is important to know how big the dataset must be and how the performance may improve with the number of training weeks. Therefore, as final experiment to obtain an estimation of the required amount of training data for a new crop/plantation, the complete dataset was divided in different percentages of training and testing. Fig. 10 shows the weekly error of both PLSR and ANFIS methods with respect to the training dataset percentage. Download : Download high-res image (68KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 10. Performance comparison for linear regression and ANFIS with respect to the % of samples used to train. According to the figure, it is noticeable that ANFIS performance is much better than PLSR if there are enough samples to train the system. In cases where the percentage of samples for training is low (less than 25% of the data, i.e. less than 4 months of data for a given field), PLSR overperforms ANFIS. This case is relevant for new plantations without historical data of previous reports. In such situations, the PLSR predictive model may be used in early stages, before switching to ANFIS once enough samples to train the system properly are collected. 4.2. Scenario 2 The goal is to predict the irrigation of a plantation based on its weather and soil measured variables but using a SIDSS system trained exclusively with other fields. This will be the hardest scenario as it will be necessary to predict the irrigation needs of a field with no previous irrigation reports of that specific plantation. This scenario attempts to show the potential of our methodology to create a universal irrigation estimator of a given crop – in our case, lemon trees – for any given plantation, independently of the location and/or terrain. A lower performance can be expected in comparison to what could be achieved by retraining the system with information of the plantation (scenario 1), which is sacrificed for the benefit of not having to generate manual irrigation report for new plantations. Cross validation, specifically leave-one_plantation-out is applied in validation. Thus, 2014 and 2015 data from two of the plantations are used for training, while the remaining plantation data (2014 + 2015) is used for testing. This is repeated 3 times, leaving a different plantation out of the training set each time, and the results averaged. Table 6 shows the error and standard deviation of this scenario for PLSR and ANFIS using different features vector used to compare the performance. Table 6. Scenario 2 results summary. Method Features vector Test plantation 1 Test plantation 2 Test plantation 3 Total Weekly error (min) Std Weekly error (min) Std Weekly error (min) Std Average weekly error (min) Average Std PLSR VWC1 + SWP + ETc 364.1 205.6 179.4 141.2 227.5 185.8 257.0 177.5 ANFIS VWC1 + SWP + ETc 373.2 300.7 175.4 129.8 421.4 495.5 323.3 308.6 PLSR SWP + ETc 182.2 133.3 176.2 120.9 224.9 172.38 194.4 142.2 ANFIS SWP + ETc 200.8 140.1 156.5 126.9 234.8 192.6 197.4 153.2 The best feature vector F6 used in scenario 1 is used as input. In this case PLSR outperforms ANFIS with an average error of 257.0 min in comparison with 323.3 min for ANFIS. However, we noticed that, in this scenario, removing the VWC1 sensor results in a better performance for both methods as a universal estimator. This is explained because the VWC sensor is very dependent on the soil where it is installed and, as both algorithms were trained with a sensor installed in a different plantation than the one that is predicting, the provided information introduces noise and does not help the system to estimate properly the water need. This does not happen, however, with the SWP sensor, which quantifies the tendency of water to move from one area to another in the soil and it is less dependent on the soil installed. Removing the VWC sensor results in a better performance of the system obtaining an average weekly error of 194.4 min with PLSR and 197.4 min with ANFIS. This result proves that there is certain potential to develop a universal estimator using our system for a given crop, although this means an increase of the average error. This error could be reduced if more than 2 plantations of the same crop were available for training. Both PLSR and ANFIS performs similarly, being PLSR slightly better. 5. Conclusions This paper describes the design and development of an automatic decision support system to manage irrigation in agriculture. The main characteristic of system is the use of continuous soil measurements to complement climatic parameters to precisely predict the irrigation needs the crops, in contrast with previous works that are based only on weather variables or doesn’t specify the quantity of water required by the crops. The use of real-time information from the soil parameters in a closed loop control scheme allows adapting the decision support system to local perturbations, avoiding the accumulative effect due to errors in consecutive weekly estimation, and/or detecting if the irrigation calculated for the SIDSS has been performed by the farmer. The analysis of the performance of the system is accomplished comparing the decisions taken by a human expert and the decision support component. Two machine learning techniques, PLSR and ANFIS, have been proposed as the basis of our reasoning engine and analysed in order to obtain the best performance. The experiments have taken place in three commercial plantations of citrus trees located in the South-East of Spain. A first experimental scenario shows a comparison of the system’s performance using soil sensors in addition to the weather information for predicting year 2015 using 2014 information to train the system. The usage of soil sensor in the three plantations accomplished a 22% less of weekly error in comparison to the performance of using only weather information. A second scenario shows the potential of our system as universal estimator for a given crop, i.e. the use case of installing the system in a new plantation, not having previous information of it. For this application, VWC sensors should be removed due to their high dependence with the soil type. Although, as expected, the estimation error increases in this scenario, it does not require historical data from agronomical reports to be retrained, which implies a significant advantage, in particular for new plantations in early stages. If more training data from a bigger variety of field were available, a better performance in this scenario could be expected. Another possible improvement for this scenario will be the addition of a VWC to get a better performance than using only the matric potential sensors. However, in order to use the VWC sensor in this scenario, a precise study of the soil textures of the plantation will be required to extrapolate the VWC sensor information to similar soil textures where the DSS was trained. For future research, we aim to extend and evaluate the system in plantations different than citrus and analyse the performance under several conditions and regions. Thus, adding the weather forecast as input of the SIDSS could help to improve the next week irrigation schedule and consider the predicted rainfall in our estimation. Similarly, past rainfall information, that did not prove beneficial in our system due to the region of Murcia characteristics, may become a good factor to improve the accuracy of the system in regions with a more regular and predictable raining pattern. We also aim to capture a bigger dataset that will allow us to generate more general models towards a universal irrigation estimator of a given crop. This dataset will also explore the use of multiple sensors per plantation in order to address inhomogeneous ground conditions in the different plantation as well as provide more input information to the system for a better reasoning.

  Main Objective: To develop and implement a closed-loop, variable-rate drip irrigation system that uses satellite imagery to optimize yield and water use efficiency in vineyards.
  Study Location: Galt, CA, USA
  Data Sources: Satellite imagery, Weather data
  Technologies Used: Satellite imagery, NDVI, Variable-rate drip irrigation system, Central computer, Irrigation control cells, Solenoid valves
  Key Findings: The system resulted in a 26% yield increase in the second year and an average increase of 16% in water use efficiency.

The yield maximizing area responded directly to the targeted irrigation, while the water efficiency area demonstrated significant improvements in water efficiency between 10%–20%.
  Extract 1: "In this paper, we show that a variable rate automatic irrigation system coupled with satellite derived irrigation scheduling analytics can result in: 1) increased yield uniformity and 2) reversal of the yield trends by increasing the yield on the originally low yield areas and limiting the yield on the originally high yield areas."&#x20;
  Extract 2: "These changes can be achieved on irrigation control cells as low as 15 m × 15m. The double drip line system developed for this paper can be easily reconfigured to adjust to any management zones that may affect variability in the field. In locations where soil and management practices vary across the vineyard, dynamic management zones can be defined by clustering the irrigation control cell to reflect the new management zones."&#x20;
  Limitations: None
  Relevance Evaluation: This paper is highly relevant to the point about exploring the concept of closed-loop control in autonomous irrigation systems.

The paper provides a detailed description of the design and implementation of a closed-loop, variable-rate drip irrigation system that leverages satellite imagery and NDVI to determine irrigation requirements and automates water delivery to optimize yield and water use efficiency.

The system optimizes water delivery for 140 cells located across four hectares of land based on two independent objectives (e.g., maximizing yield and increasing water efficiency) and is continuously adapting irrigation scheduling to the local spatial–temporal variability of the vegetation across the growing season. Irrigation is controlled by a central computer that issues commands to 693 control nodes to start irrigation based on the analysis of satellite images. The control nodes are laid out to create 15 m ×15 m cells and each cell can be addressed independently and can irrigate differentially. After two years of operation, this variable rate drip irrigation approach resulted in a 26% yield increase in the second year and an average increase of 16% in water use efficiency. This paper demonstrates that combining closed loop automation and advanced irrigation analytics can improve the water use efficiency and increase the yield on existing agricultural lands.

Introduction Digitization of the physical world is fundamentally changing the industries fueled by sensor networks, automation, and robotization [1]. Sensor-based decision support or automated infrastructure control can minimize manual intervention. In agriculture, data driven decisions can enable a sustainable use of water, land utilization, and chemicals control through optimized analytics [2]. Platforms that fuse sensor network data with automatic control can lead to dynamic operation that adapts to the environment in real-time as new data becomes available to the system. One important application in agriculture is irrigation, which can be controlled by sensor networks and automate the operation of the water delivery systems. Despite continuous advancement in control systems, irrigation is mostly a manual process using traditional practices. Many of the high value crops in California, such as grapes, are drip irrigated with water usually applied uniformly across larger parcels or blocks of land. This often results in nonoptimized delivery of water, fertilizers, and pesticides. For example, intrafield soil water holding capacity can fluctuate significantly, often translating into as much as fivefold yield differences across less than a few meter distance [3]. To overcome such variability, management zones can be defined, where each zone may have similar yield or vigor characteristics (for grapes) and can be managed accordingly. Minimizing yield variability [4] through differential management [5] has been proposed in the past. Variable rate management in vineyards has been proposed both in USA [6] and in Australia [7] but only relying on post-harvest analysis. Management zones have been delineated based on soil [8], vegetation index [9], or using fuzzy logic clustering techniques [10]. While defining management zones is a well-established technique, active control of variable rate management is still not fully developed. In the past, sensor networks have been deployed in vineyard settings [11] at various levels of sophistication. Most of the application attempted a better monitoring of the micro environmental conditions in the vineyards thereby providing a more granular feedback to vineyard workers [12]. Here, we present a large-scale demonstration of a variable rate drip irrigation system that takes advantage of a close loop control system to deliver the right amount of water through an automated system. Using this new variable drip irrigation technology, the applied water amount can be optimized dynamically. Ultimately, it is envisioned that such a system can be designed to deliver the optimum amount of water to each plant. Delivery of water to each management zone requires timely analytics to determine irrigation requirements, to transmit the irrigation schedule to a control computer, and to automate control of the drip irrigation infrastructure to dispense the optimum amount of water. In this paper, we show that a variable rate automatic irrigation system coupled with satellite derived irrigation scheduling analytics can result in: 1) increased yield uniformity and 2) reversal of the yield trends by increasing the yield on the originally low yield areas and limiting the yield on the originally high yield areas. The advantage of a variable rate irrigation system is the increased yield on existing farm land without the need to convert additional land to agricultural use. The efficient use of technology not only can increase the yield on existing farm land but also promises to manage more efficiently resources like water and fertilizer. To the best of our knowledge, this paper constitutes the first and largest closed loop drip irrigation system that directly couples remote observations with an automated dense sensor network that is operated from the cloud. Not only the drip irrigation in our approach is fully automated but at the same time this system results in significant water savings while improving yield. SECTION II. Sensor Network A. System Architecture The experiment is conducted on a 20-year-old, 12.4 hectare, drip irrigated Cabernet Sauvignon vineyard near Galt, CA, USA. A four hectare section of the vineyard containing the full range of yields, as reported by the 2012 yield map, is selected for the closed loop irrigation system. The irrigation system is changed from a single drip line to a double drip-line variable irrigation system with centrally controlled irrigation sensor network. The control system allows differential irrigation along segments of 15 m. A 15 m ×15 m area defined as “the irrigation control cell” is the basic unit of control where the water delivery within that area can be independently controlled (Fig. 1). The experimental area, called “Precision,” is composed of 140 of such independent cells where cells are grouped in two sections “Yield maximizing section” and “Water efficiency section.” These two differently managed sections have different objective functions: 1) maximize the yield and 2) increase water use efficiency. The area is monitored using satellite imagery that constitutes the input for irrigation requirement analytics. Besides monitoring the area, the closed loop system runs the analytics to determine the irrigation water requirement and controls the irrigation infrastructure to dispense the water. The analytics output is transmitted to a sensor network that dispense the water accordingly. The irrigation schedule is sent weekly to the irrigation system, where the computer splits the schedule for 6 or 7 days irrigation and issues commands to the management zones. The outcome of the differential irrigation is monitored by the next satellite imagery that will indicate if expected change occurred and the irrigation water schedule is readjusted based on the new satellite images. An adjacent area, called “Conventional” area, having similar yield characteristics and soil composition as the Precision area in 2012, is uniformly irrigated to serve as a reference area. The closed loop irrigation system is automatically operated with minimal human input. We note that domain expertise related to adjustment in grape sugar content is required to be added to the irrigation schedule calculations. Additional data layers like high resolution drone or thermal images of the vineyard can be added to the analytics for monitoring canopy stresses that may not be detectable from satellite images.

Show All B. Variable Rate Irrigation Infrastructure For the variable rate infrastructure, the original single drip irrigation line is divided into a double drip line system consisting of a water supply line and an irrigation line and segmented into 15 m sections [Fig. 2(a)]. The supply line is always filled with water and is connected to the main water supply. The irrigation line can be filled once the solenoid valve is opened and the water is allowed to flow into that segment. The irrigation line has emitters installed that will let water drip and irrigate the soil. The supply and irrigation line are connected at each 15 m through a control node that allows water to be diverted from the supply line to the irrigation line. The control nodes consist of a solenoid valve, a controller, and a check valve. The controller issues the command to open/close the solenoid valve and allows water to flow into the segment, while the check valve impedes water to fill the previous management segment. There is a power and communication line that runs along the supply line and connects each control node to a central control point. The controller nodes are installed at the edge of an area that establishes a one-to-one correspondence between the information extracted from a parcel of land (via satellite imagery and/or ground-based sensors) and a management area. We chose a 15 m ×15 m control cell dimension, higher than the original Landsat [13] pixel resolution (30 m ×30 m), which was used in this paper. The original 30 m ×30 m Landsat pixels are interpolated to 15 m ×15 m pixel size using pan sharpening and aligned exactly with the experimental 15 m ×15 m cells [Fig. 2(b)]. We note that managing vineyard at higher resolution than the satellite images did not provide any benefit as discussed in Section IV, as there is an optimal size for the control cells. Fig. 2. (a) Double drip line composed of supply and irrigation lines connected through the control nodes that operate the solenoid valve. (b) Details of an irrigation control cell that groups 5 double drip lines and its spatial alignment with a Landsat satellite image pixel. Show All The control nodes are 15 m apart along each irrigation line segment (covering 10 vines) and the irrigation lines (and vine rows) are 3.3 m apart. Alternating, 4 or 5 control nodes are therefore lumped together to define each “irrigation control cell,” which covers on average an area of 15 m ×15 m [Fig. 2(a)]. Since the vine rows could not be perfectly aligned with satellite pixel resolution, the number of rows entering in a cell is varied between 4 and 5 to create the digital footprint of satellite images on the irrigation system [Fig. 2(b)]. There are a total of 140 independent control cells, with 40 or 50 vines in each of the cells distributed across the four hectare area with a total of 693 control nodes (Fig. 3). Fig. 3. Photograph of the interior and controller box that operated the solenoid valve and the installed sensor network in the vineyard. Show All The irrigation schedule is managed by a central computer that issues the command to the local microcontroller that operates the solenoid valves to keep it open for the required amount of time. The amount of irrigation water dispensed is controlled by the time interval the solenoid valve is kept open and water drips through the drip emitters mounted on the irrigation line. Time synchronization between the local microcontroller and the central computer is carried out once per day. In addition to actuating (open/close) the solenoid valve, each node keeps track of the time the valve is open and reports back to the control computer which aggregates the data and runs background calculations to verify that the system operates as expected. C. Sensor Communication The experimental area is divided in 14 subnets where each subnet contains 4 or 5 rows of grape rows. Along each subnet there are ten irrigation control cells. Each subnet is controlled by a gateway that receives and transmits the data from the central computer to the 40 or 50 control nodes [Fig. 4(a)] within that subnet. The central computer is distributing the irrigation schedule to the gateways and each gateway sends commands to individual control nodes under its command. The schematic of the message stack protocol for communicating is shown in Fig. 4(b). A command message is encapsulated in a queue stack. Each header contained a destination node address and a function code; the address field is 8 bits, the function code is 8 bits, and the check-sum is a 16 bit cyclic redundancy check (CRC) (see Fig. 4(b)-A). A specific example is shown in Fig. 4(b)-B, where the central computer communicates with a selected control node via a selected gateway. There are three required steps to get the message from the central computer to a selected control node and an additional three steps to send back an acknowledgment from the control node to the central computer. First, the central computer sends the message to a selected gateway. Second, the gateway, based on a “forwarding” function code, moves the first fixed length header to the trailer space in the message and transmits the new message (Fig. 4(b)-C) simultaneously to all nodes in the subnet. The node for which the message is intended will recognize its unique address in the message. Once the control node performs the requested operation (e.g., open valve), it rewrites the data section leaving the header and trailer intact. As the central computer expects a response, the control node prepares the stack to be sent back. The control node transmits the response message to the gateway. The gateway processes the message by moving the first trailer (before the CRC) to the header and transmits the new message to the central computer. The central computer, expecting a response, processes the result and acknowledges that the message is successfully delivered to the control node. The transmitted command can be the irrigation requirements (number of minutes that the irrigation line needs to be filled with water) or just open/close commands at the beginning and end of the day to bring all control nodes into the same state. Each subnet includes a flow meter that measures the water consumption for the whole subnet. In each subnet there are 40 or 50 control boxes that are connected by serial bus communication wires to each gateway. At the end of the rows, wires that crossed rows, are buried underground. The communication line did not exceeds 1500 m as this value is tested to constitute the upper limit for signal integrity using RS485 communications. Irrigation of the 140 control cells is enabled by daily continuous communication with all 693 control nodes, where each node is uniquely identified (addressed) by a source routing technique that specifies a specific gateway-node pair. Fig. 4. (a) Schematics of the communication network between the central computer and control nodes composed of 14 subnets and 140 irrigation control cells. (b) Data communication stack and communication protocols between the central computer and control nodes. Show All A cellular link connects the central computer to the cloud-based analytics, allowing downloading irrigation schedules and remote diagnostics. A message notification system is implemented that alerts valve’s malfunctioning or nonintended water usage. The power lines extend to all control nodes and is fanned out at the start of each row. The power distribution system is optimized to maintain 12 V along each line such that controllers located farthest from the gateway can open/close the solenoid valves under normal operating conditions. While the current implementation is based on wired control, a wireless communication method had been prototyped and tested as a next generation system. For the wireless option, the power harvesting from solar panels required for operation could not be achieved due to the dense canopy and panel placement limitations dictated by daily maintenance work on the farm. D. Irrigation Requirement Analytics Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 imagery obtained from the U.S. Geological Survey [14] provides reflectance data in eight different spectral bands every 16 days (alternating by 8 days for each satellite). The vineyard investigated in this paper is on the overlapping section of path 43 row 34 and path 44 row 33 for Landsat 7 and 8, respectively, which provides a satellite observation every eight days. Two of these spectral bands, the red (0.64–0.67 micrometer) and the near infrared (0.77–0.90 micrometer) are sensitive to vineyard canopy development [15] and are used to determine the NDVI [16] NDVI= NIR−RED NIR+RED (1) View Source where RED and NIR are the red and near infrared intensity values for each pixel in the image. The NDVI value varies between 0 and 1. Its value changes as the canopy develops through the growing season and its spatial distribution across a vineyard reflects the variability in vigor and ultimately the water holding capacity of the soil. All satellite images are corrected for atmosphere induced scattering [17]. The amount of water delivered to each cell is then calculated from the NDVI and the water loss due to evapo-transpiration (ET0) using the Penman–Monteith equation [18]. The daily weather inputs (insolation, wind, temperature, and relative humidity) are obtained from the nearest California Irrigation Management Information System weather station (Fair Oaks, CA, USA) [19] to calculate the reference evapo-transpiration (ET0). The amount of water that is scheduled for irrigation ET cb (in mm day−1) is then calculated from the reference evapo-transpiration (ET0) [20] and adjusted for grapes using the basal crop coefficient ( k cb ) which serves as an aggregated coefficient of the physical and physiological characteristics of the plant [20]. A management factor, f , is included that can adjust the water delivered to each of the irrigation control cell ET cb =f⋅ k cb ⋅ ET 0 . (2) View Source The basal crop coefficient, k cb , is calculated from the Mapping Evapo-Transpiration at High Resolution with Internalized Calibration model [21], [22] using the NDVI value for each cell. The basal crop coefficient can be obtained by subtracting the soil heat flux and sensible heat flux from the net radiation at the surface [22]. In case the Landsat data is obscured by clouds, the NDVI values are extrapolated using historical reflectance data from the same plot of the vineyard. The irrigation schedule for each cell is based on (2), with the value of management factor, f , varied from 0.5 for the first eight weeks of irrigation up to 0.75 during the rest of the season in 2013. In 2014, the management factor, f , is 0.5 for the first five weeks and then increased to 0.7 for the rest of the season. The management factor, f , is used to apply moderate water stress to the vines and improve fruit quality and to increase yield in low vigor area. The management factor is a parameter that can be changed and it can incorporate domain knowledge or management practices on the farm. The evapo-transpiration is calculated for the following week based on real-time weather data. The irrigation schedule for individual control cells is calculated using the NDVI value and ET cb taking into account the number of drippers for each zone and dripper specifications (i.e., 1.89 l h−1). Irrigation schedules are generated on a weekly basis for each zone and transmitted to the central control computer. Once a schedule is uploaded to the computer, it reads the zone number and number of hours per day that needs to enable the irrigation and issue a command to the control node containing the solenoid valve to open and allow water in the irrigation line for the required time interval. Once the required irrigation time passes, the central computer issue a command to close the solenoid valve. E. Variable Rate Management Zone Delineation Based on the 2012 yield map, irrigation control cells that had a yield value below 20 tonnes hectare−1 and low NDVI value are grouped in two management zones: 1) the yield maximizing zones and 2) the water efficiency zones. The yield maximizing zones has low yield in 2012 and water is used to increase in that zone. The water efficiency area is targeted to minimize the water consumption. We note that there could be other objectives that can be implemented; e.g., reduce NDVI variability, reduce variability in grape quality, or minimize fertilizer use. Many objectives can be tied to delineate zones based on spectral indices like NDVI that is readily available even for farm where historical yield or soil data may not exist. F. Yield Analysis Methods Crop yield maps are used to establish grape production variability [23], [24]. Crop yield maps are measured in 2012, 2013, and 2014 using the Advanced Technology Viticulture (ATV, Joslin, SA, Australia) yield monitor systems installed on three self-propelled, over-the-row, trunk-shaking mechanical GH9000 AIM harvesters (Ag Industrial Manufacturing, Lodi, CA, USA). The yield monitors included a differential global positioning system, a grape weighing unit and a data recording system. The grape weighing unit contains a load cell weight bridge and a belt speed sensor. Geo-referencing is realized by simultaneously logging the coordinates and synchronizing them with the weight measurements. The data is transferred to a computer and accessed using proprietary software from ATV. Belt scales are zeroed before each harvest and the system is calibrated against actual truck weights at the beginning of the harvest season and weekly thereafter. Calibration is validated by ensuring that weight error ranges are within 8% of the weight at the winery, but actual measurements are consistently within 3%–4%. Harvest data is transferred into a data processing module developed in R Studio (RStudio Inc., Boston, MA, USA) to convert mass flow units into tonnes hectare−1, to eliminate measurement points that are outliers, and to normalize measurements from different harvesters. Yield data with values larger than three standard deviations from the mean are removed. The data cleaning steps eliminates only 5% of the original data. After yield data cleaning, the data is further processed by a software package (VESPER Version 1.62) [25] for interpolation and kriging to 3 ×3 m resolution. The raster data sets are then transferred into a program (Manifold System, Manifold Net Ltd., Carson City, NV, USA), where a 3 m ×3 m geo-referenced grid is created. For this paper, the yield data is further aggregated to 15 m ×15 m geo-referenced cells that are within the study area by summing up all yield values within that cells. If yield data points are at the boundary of two adjacent cells, the weight is distributed equally between the cells. Spatial statistics are quantified using the Cambardella index (CI) [26] and the Mean Correlation Distance (MCD) [27] using variogram parameters extracted from VESPER software [25]. The utility of such studies has been demonstrated in the past [28]. Using an exponential variogram model, the nugget ( C 0 ) and sill ( C 0 +C ) of the yield data are calculated across data points spaced up to 100 m. The CI is defined as [26] CI= C 0 ( C 0 +C) ∗100 (3) View Source and quantifies the extent across which correlation is preserved. A CI value below 25 means strong spatial dependence, CI between 25 and 75 means a moderate spatial dependence, and CI above 75 means a weak spatial dependence. MCD represents the distance along which correlation is preserved. The MCV is defined as [27] MCD= 3 8 ( C C+ C 0 )a (4) View Source where a is the range for the variogram or the distance above which value no correlation is detected. The three variogram parameters are estimated for the 2012–2014 yield data acquired across the whole variable rate irrigation area, as well as yield increasing and water efficiency sections. For comparison, the same calculations are carried out for the reference area where year to year variations are small. SECTION III. Results Differential irrigation is implemented for each irrigation control cell. As an example, in 2013 the yield maximizing section had an overall lower NDVI value compared with the water efficiency section (consistent with the 2012 yield data). Irrigating only the yield maximizing section for the first five weeks (irrigation started on April 28, 2013) the NDVI quickly increased above the water efficiency area’s NDVI value. Once the NDVI reverses the trends it can be maintained across the whole growing season by providing more water to the yield maximizing zone. After the first five weeks, all irrigation control cells are irrigated based on the corresponding NDVI values acquired across the growing season. In 2014, the yield maximizing section were irrigated the first four weeks and then all cells were irrigated based on their corresponding NDVI value. The yield data for each individual irrigation control cell is shown in Fig. 5. The key results of the experiment are summarized in Table I, with the mean values and the coefficient of variation (CoV) (relative standard deviation) for each section and year. The mean yields in the reference and trial areas are similar, at 20.0 and 20.1 tonnes hectare−1 for 2012 when the entire vineyard is uniformly irrigated. Lower fruitfulness in 2013 resulted in lower yields compared to 2012. There is no significant improvement in yield in the trial area in 2013, i.e., the yield maximizing and water efficiency sections, which is expected given the growth cycle of grapes. However, a substantial improvement in water efficiency is observed in 2014: 22% for the water efficiency section and 5% for the yield maximizing section. In 2014, yield increased 26% and 5% in the yield and water maximizing sections, respectively. Also, water use efficiency increased by 10% for the water efficiency section, with the water efficiency for the yield maximizing section remaining the same as the reference section. TABLE I Yield, Irrigation Water, and Water Efficiency Analysis for the Yield Maximizing, Water Efficiency, and Reference Section of the Vineyard Fig. 5. Top: Yield data for a uniformly irrigated test area in 2012 and a variable rate irrigated test area in 2013 and 2014. For 2013 and 2014, the yield maximizing section is outlined on the top images. Bottom: The yield for the control adjacent area. Show All The CoV for 2013 (Table I) decreased significantly indicating that uniformity of yield distribution is improved more than 50% after the first year (as change in CoV coefficient). After increasing the uniformity, the second year experiment demonstrated that yield trends can be reversed compared to 2012 yield map. In the yield maximizing section where yield is lower in 2012 became high yield areas in 2014 and the high yield area (water efficiency section) in 2012 became low yield in 2014 compared with plot average values. This reversal in yield is possible after only two years using the water as the only parameter that is varied across the trial area. The change in yield trends in 2014 resulted also in an increase of the CoV that is expected considering yield trend reversal. Table II summarizes the CI and MCD values across the three years of yield data. The CI indicates that there is a strong spatial dependence of yield across the variable rate irrigated area and the correlation is preserved for all three years even if the yield has significant spatial changes. The same conclusion is also supported by the MCD that shows a long range correlation with a significant increased value in 2014. Both the Cambardella and MCD values remain very similar for the reference area across the three years of this paper. Variable rate irrigation can change the spatial coherence of yield data on the small scale. TABLE II Spatial Statistics for the Yield and Water Efficiency Section The two-year study on yield and water use efficiency raises two questions. First, why are the yield enhancements small in the first year and significantly larger in the second year? The answer is that grape vines undergo an 18 months growing cycle between bud initiation and harvest [29]. Inflorescence induction and differentiation occurring 18 months prior to harvest are the key factors that govern grape yield potential. Thus, temperature and sunshine as well as stress conditions 18 months prior greatly affect the number of clusters per vine as well as the number of berries per cluster and thus yield [30]. Proper irrigation during bud formation minimizes water stress and its impact is expected to appear at harvest of the second year; which indeed resulted in a 26% increase in the yield in our experiment. The yield increase of 2% in the first year can be attributed to larger berry sizes. The second question is why the water efficiency dropped in the second year from 22% to 10%. Due to water availability constraints in the second year, the start of the irrigation in the reference area is delayed by one month compared to the trial area. SECTION IV. Economic Analysis Adoption of the variable rate irrigation technology required new irrigation infrastructure and irrigation analytics calculation. The first aspect is the change of existing uniform drip irrigation system with a variable rate irrigation system. The practicality of adopting the variable rate technology is influenced by two factors: 1) investment cost and 2) the time for return on investment (ROI). With regards to ROI, the variable rate drip line system is best suited for high variability areas where differential management can improve low yield cells while managing water efficiently. The cost of a variable rate drip line irrigation system as presented herein depends on the spatial extent of the irrigation control cells. The smaller the control cells, the higher the infrastructure costs will be. Clearly, the size of the irrigation control cell should address yield or soil variability and this will drive the number of control nodes, solenoid valves, etc. Current estimates for implementing the variable rate drip line system at 30 m resolution can approach approximately a one-time cost of $5000 per hectare (assuming large scale fabrication of the components). If the system is fully packaged, installation costs should be similar to today’s system. In Fig. 6, the expected yield improvements are calculated as a function of control cell size (i.e., for the yield variability of the vineyard as shown in Fig. 5). Two assumptions are made in this calculation: 1) in regions with lower than average yield, the yield can be increased to the average yield of the field using variable rate irrigation and 2) the maximum yield improvement for the entire field (in the limit of very small control cell sizes) is 20%. We note that 20% is a realistic but potentially conservative assumption given that we have already shown 26% yield improvements. Fig. 6(a) shows that for very small control cells, the benefit of the technology saturates (approaching the assumed 20% maximum yield improvement). For very large control cells, variable rate irrigation becomes ineffective compared to uniform irrigation, which shows that the spatial resolution of the management zone is just too coarse to successfully mitigate the variability. In terms of the cost benefits, an average price of 500pertonofgrapesisassumed,withapotential 1200 profit per acre due to 20% increase in yield. The profit obtained should cover the cost of required new equipment (conversion of single drip line to a double drip line system) and the cost of required electronic components. Fig. 6. Expected yield increase and ROI as a function of the control cell’s size. The optimum cell size is ~30m where the maximum benefits are expected. Show All Estimates of the ROI at larger manufacturing volumes as a function of the control zone size are shown in Fig. 6(b) with an optimum control cell size of around 30 m ×30 m where the ROI is approximately two years for grapes. Table III quantifies the cost of control electronics as a function of the number of fabricated units where larger volume decreases the unit price for the control nodes. Cost analysis for four distinctive crops indicates the number of years required to recover the investment (Table III-B). We note that all the calculations are made for crops that command high market prices. The ROI for deploying such a variable rate drip line system for strawberries, tomatoes, almonds, and grapes is 0.5, 0.8, 1.6, and 2.5 years, respectively, where the control zone is set at 30 m (the spatial resolution of Landsat imagery). These calculations may change if private satellite imagery needs to be purchased or if the deployed infrastructure will not remain in place for at least five years. Adoption of variable rate irrigation technology can have significant impact in regions such as the Indian subcontinent, most of Africa, Australia, and Western USA where water extraction often exceeds groundwater recharging rates [31]. TABLE III (a) Economic Analysis of Variable Rate Technology Cost as Function of Number of Controlled Units Fabricated. (b) Return of Investment for Different Crops as Function of Number of Control Units Used for Variable Rate Irrigation The second important aspect that needs to be implemented to scale-up variable rate irrigation is the data analytics platform that can ingest large scale geospatial data [32] and create real-time irrigation requirement. Such platforms should automatically combine real-time weather with remotely sensed data and automate and parallelize the analytics that determine the irrigation requirement. Only considered for the continental U.S., the required data sets can be several Terabytes of data each week. Near real-time irrigation prescriptions are virtually impossible using conventional (sequential) data processing techniques due to computational constraints. By way of comparison, a “big” data platform such as a highly distributed file system and processing environment leveraging the MapReduce framework [33] splits these large data files into small manageable 64 kB units, which can then be processed in parallel, thereby enabling computation “in the” data. For example, to scale the irrigation forecasting solution on a global scale we are using more than 32 servers, each with its own multicore processing unit and several local hard discs, where the irrigation analytics can be readily accelerated by a factor of 600 or more. With this system, irrigation requirements can be calculated in near real-time and scaled world-wide and adjusted for unexpected events like excessive precipitation, abrupt changes in daily temperature, and air moisture levels. Current development in big data technology can enable large scale irrigation forecasting using geospatial data [34]. The incremental cost to analyze new satellite data or weather data, in a big data framework, is minimal compared with manual analysis where data download, spatial alignment of data, and running analytics require significant manpower. Automation and machine to machine communication, as demonstrated in this paper, facilitate variable rate irrigation and provide consistency across growing season. SECTION V. Discussion The above results highlight the benefit of the closed loop variable rate irrigation approach where irrigation is fully automated. The variable rate drip line system presented here has the advantage of being flexible to deliver water differentially across a spatial area with high temporal resolution. For example, multiple irrigation periods during each day (to maintain constant soil moisture and avoid water pooling) can be readily implemented to maintain constant soil moisture or minimize water usage by applying the right amount of water at the right time. With proper management zone selection, yield can be significantly improved or water can be saved. The yield maximizing area responded directly to the targeted irrigation and it can be safely assumed that this is the main reason for the improved yield values. The improvements in water efficiency between 10%–20%, demonstrate that similar yields can be obtained using significantly less water. This can be a substantial benefit if the technology is adopted across a large geographical region. If applied to all grape producing region in California, which used 2 billion m3 irrigation water in 2010 (DWR 2014, USDA 2010), 15% improvements amounts to 300 million m3 reduction in water usage. SECTION VI. Conclusion This paper validates that: 1) variability can be minimized across a vineyard and 2) low yield areas can be turned into high yield areas using only differential irrigation. Two different objectives, increased yield and preserved water, can be achieved simultaneously in a vineyard by controlling water delivery on a spatial checkboard pattern. We demonstrated that management zone delineation can be defined based on NDVI and yield data and those management zones are a good representation of the variability. This paper demonstrates that with real-time control on the irrigation, the vigor of the canopy can be improved in a few weeks at the beginning of the season and reverse yield patterns after only 2 years of variable rate irrigation. These changes can be achieved on irrigation control cells as low as 15 m × 15m. The double drip line system developed for this paper can be easily reconfigured to adjust to any management zones that may affect variability in the field. In locations where soil and management practices vary across the vineyard, dynamic management zones can be defined by clustering the irrigation control cell to reflect the new management zones. Management zone boundaries can be changed dynamically during the growing season by just logically clustering irrigation control cells differently, without changing physical infrastructure. This proof of concept experiment carried out in a vineyard demonstrates the advantage to automate and customize irrigation for control zones of as little as 40 vines that can result in a 26% improvement in yield and an average 16% increase in water use efficiency. Large scale deployment of variable rate irrigation driven by digital data can enable efficient water use in regions where water is scarce and expensive, as well as during drought, while maintaining and improving currently achievable crop yields.

When the irrigation area is huge or the gradient of field is high, the requirement of irrigation uniformity in the whole field can not be satisfied. Automatic water supply control system of graded constant pressure by variable frequency speed combines the frequency conversion and automation technologies, and is an electromechanical integrated intelligent device with functions of variable frequency speed control and automatic closed-loop control.

Introduction With the aggravation of water and energy crisis, more and more attention was paid to water and energy saving irrigation technologies. Pipeline irrigation technologies such as sprinkler irrigation and micro-irrigation was speeded rapidly, and developed towards the direction of low energy consumption, high efficient water saving, high automation degree and multiple-objective utilization. It is reported that in 2000, the area of sprinkler irrigation and micro-irrigation in the world have reached 3.8 million hm2 and 26.67 million hm2, respectively. Low-pressure pipeline irrigation was also greatly developed. To the end of 2008 in China, the areas of sprinkler irrigation and micro-irrigation have reached 4.07 million hm2, and Low-pressure pipeline irrigation area has reached 58.77 million hm2. However, there are also limitations for those pipeline irrigation systems using pressurizing electromechanical pumps. As the water consumption in the field usually changes in a random state, this uncertainty often result in pressure and flow changes in the water pipe network. Moreover, in order to adapt the variation of water consumption in the field and ensure the water supply, the working conditions of the water supply system and pumps have to change frequently which fails to meet the requirement of constant pressure for pipeline irrigation system. Therefore, the pipeline irrigation systems used to widely use regulation facilities like water tower, high water tank, pressure-regulating tank and valve to control the variation of pressure and flow changes of water pipe network system. In addition, for systems with large irrigation area or high gradient, a pipeline network in constant pressure can not meet the uniformity requirement in the whole field. The automatic water supply control system of graded constant pressure by variable frequency speed set different pressure graded control for different irrigation sub areas. According to changes of pipe flow, it regulates the power supply frequency, adjusts the pump speed, and changes the water flow rate to realize grading and constant-pressure water supply. It also combines with automatic control technology to achieve automatic switching and unattended irrigation. This system has advantages of high irrigation uniformity, high water and energy saving efficiency, high degree of automation as well as easy operation and management. SECTION II. Composition and working principle of the system A. Composition The automatic water supply control system of graded constant pressure by variable frequency speed is composed of frequency converter (including PID controller), programmable time switch controller, programmable logic controller (PLC), water level display controller, remote transmission pressure gauge, water level sensors and related electrical control components. It can automatically control one or more three-phase 380 V, 50Hz pump motors at the same time and is an electromechanical integration intelligent device with functions of variable frequency speed control and automatic closed-loop control. The system is designed to set multi-stage pressure conversion circuits to switch pressure rating automatically according to requirements of a certain sub area, and control the opening and closing of the solenoid valve, so as to achieve rating and constant-pressure automatic water supply, ensure the irrigation uniformity and improve the quality of irrigation. Besides, this system can monitor and control the level of impounding reservoirs and ensure the safety. B. Working principle The working principle of the automatic water supply control system of graded constant pressure by variable frequency speed under constant pressure (shown in Figure 1) is to detect the pressure of control points in the pipe network by remote transmission pressure gauge, and convert it into electrical signal which is fed back to PID controller. Then PID controller compares the fed back signal and the given pressure to obtain a frequency signal to control the working frequency of frequency converter, so as to control the rotating speed of the water pump and the outlet flow to realize the requirement of constant pressure for control points when the flow in the pipe network changes. At the same time, PID controller will provide PLC with the pressure control information of different rating pressure so that PLC can control PID controller in terms of start and brake, troubleshooting and various electrical controlling. In addition, this system uses PTC to deliver water according to the setting irrigation program of subareas, sets multi-stage pressure conversion circuits to switch pressure rating automatically and controls the start and stop of water pumps to avoid no-load operation through water level display controller. Figure 1. Operating principle of the automatic variable frequency speed controlled rating water supply system under constant pressure Show All This system realizes constant-pressure water supply by regulation of frequency converter. The constant-pressure control principal is determined by pump characteristics. Figure 2 shows the relationship between flow rate Q and pressure head H when regulating pump speed. N 1 , N 2 , N 3 describe the flow rate - pressure curves under different rotating speed nl, n2, n3, respectively. We can see from figure 2 that when decreasing the flow rate from Q 0 to Q 1 by regulating the control valve under rotating rate nl, the pressure will go up from point O to point A following curve N 1 . So it's apparent that the pressure increases (from H A to H 0 ) when decreasing the flow rate. If frequency converter is used to regulate rotating speed, when the rotating speed reduces from n1 to n2, the flow rate will decrease from Q 0 to Q 1 with a constant pressure. The characteristic above indicates that in a certain range we can change the rotating speed of pumps to adjust the outlet water flow rate, thereby maintaining constant water pressure and realizing constant-pressure water supply. If different pressure control levels were set beforehand, the rating and constant-pressure water supply can be achieved. C. The functions of the system This system has the following functions: It designs manual/automatic switching circuits. When switched to automatic position, the system regulates pump rotating speed automatically according to the changes of outlet pressure to maintain a constant pressure of pipe network. When a breakdown occurred in the circuits, it can be changed into manual position to make the pump work directly under fundamental frequency power and ensure normal water supply. The system sets multi-stage pressure conversion circuits to switch pressure rating automatically according to requirements of a certain subarea, and control the opening and closing of the solenoid valve. It can irrigate automatically according to setting irrigation program. It uses PLC to control full circle and soft start of water pumps. The water pumps stop working to protect themselves when the impounding reservoir is in a shortage of water. They also automatically start when adding water and stop after the water is full. The water level in the impounding reservoir is displayed with numbers. It has the functions of fault display and alarm, as well as electrical protection for lacking phase, short circuit, overload, instantaneous power off and so on. Figure2. Discharge/pressure relationship of centrifugal pump. Show All SECTION III. Determination of pressure grading The determination of pressure rating in this system is based on traditional design method of pipeline irrigation. It divides the system into several subareas according to the allowable pressure ranges for the pipeline irrigation system. In each subarea the working pressure differences of any two emitters are among the allowable pressure ranges. Then through pressure control by subarea and rating, it can achieve the requirement that working pressure between any two emitters in the whole system are among the allowable pressure ranges, therefore it can ensure the irrigation uniformity in the system. When determining the pressure rating, the allowable pressure ranges of the irrigation system should be given firstly to divide the system into subareas. In each subarea the working pressure differences of any two emitters should among the designed allowable pressure ranges. That is, the following formula must be satisfied: h imax− h min ≤Δh (1) View Source h imax ––The maximum working pressure of emitters in subarea i, m, i=1,2,…,n ; h imin ––The minimum working pressure of emitters in subareai, m, i=1,2,…,n ; Δh ––The designed allowable pressure ranges of the irrigation system, m. Δh= h 0 ×20% h 0 is the designed working pressure of irrigation emitters, m. After the irrigation subareas are determined, the pressure control points of the pipe network need to be determined. Generally the control points can be selected in the hinge area of the pipe network for easy management, but the area is large, they can also be chosen in the entrance of pipe network in subareas. The designed pressure rating value can be calculated according to the following formula: H i = h is + h if + z i (2) View Source H i ––designed pressure rating value in subarea i, m, i=1,2,…,n ; h is ––designed working pressure of pipe network entrance in subarea i, m, i=1,2,…,n ; h if ––head loss from pipe network entrance to pressure control points in subarea i, including the head loss along the way and the local head loss, m, i=1,2,…,n ; z i ––height difference between pipe network entrance and pressure control points in subarea i, m, i=1,2,…,n ; In traditional pipeline irrigation engineering designs and operation, rotation irrigation groups generally should be divided in strict accordance with the pump outlet flow, which could not meet the requirements of present Rural Household and Land Contract Responsibility System and diversification of agricultural planting structure. However, in the automatic variable frequency speed controlled rating water supply system under constant pressure, the rotation irrigation groups are divided by size and terrain of the irrigation field, which leads to more flexible planning and design as well as convenient operation and management. SECTION IV. Engineering example There is a lawn irrigation project in Xi'an city in Shaanxi province. The irrigation area is 2850m2. It plans to use urban water supply network as the water source to build an impounding reservoir, and irrigate by pressurized water pump. The irrigation method is fixed sprinkler irrigation, and the chosen nozzles are buried scattering rectangular nozzles of 15SQ. When the working pressure of nozzles is 0.2 MPa, the water flow rate is 0.85m3/h and the range is 6.4×6.4m . The nozzles combination form is rectangular design and round spray. Angle-adjustable nozzles are used in the corner with fan-shaped spray. The nozzle spacing and distance between two tubes are both 5m and can be adjusted slightly according to practical terrain. The gradient of the lawn field is quite large, with a biggest altitude difference of 13.31m and the shape of the field is also not regular, and the surface runoff is not allowed to generate during irrigating. If using the traditional sprinkling irrigation method to divide the system into 6 rotation irrigation groups, the flow rate and required working pressure for each rotation irrigation group is different. The actual maximum working pressure difference between nozzles reaches 13.19m (shown in table 1), but the designed allowable pressure ranges is only 4 meters. So it can not meet the requirement of irrigation uniformity and will generate surface runoff. However, when using the automatic variable frequency speed controlled rating and constant-pressure water supply system, the irrigation area can be divided into 3 subareas based on the original division of rotation groups. Different pressure ratings of 0.30MPa, 0.34MPa, 0.39Mpa are used. The pressure control points are set in the head of pipe network. Calculations of irrigation subarea dividing and pressure rating are shown in table 1. We can also see from table 1 that the actual maximum working pressure difference of nozzles reaches 3.95m and is below the designed allowable pressure ranges, which illustrates that the irrigation uniformity is achieved. Moreover, each rotation irrigation group controls irrigation by the solenoid valves and using automatic intermittent cycle, which will not generate surface runoff. Through field test, every time a rotation irrigation group spay for 5 min, and the system irrigate circularly until the requirement of irrigation schedule is satisfied. The switches of rotation irrigation group, irrigation subareas and pressure rating are controlled automatically. Overall, this automatic control system can meet the requirement of uniformity, and is easy for management. There is no surface runoff during irrigation, so it has remarkable water and energy saving effects and can protect the water pumps and pipe network. TABLE I. Caculation of irrigation subarea division and pressure rating Rotation irrigation group Maximum waterhead (m) Minimum waterhead (m) Waterhead difference in system (m) Allowable pressure ranges (m) Irrigation subarea Waterhead difference in subarea (m) Preaaure rating (MPa) 1 39.05 36.64 13.19 4.0 I 3.95 0.39 2 39.01 35.10 3 34.48 34.07 II 2.67 0.34 4 32.78 31.81 5 29.34 27.80 III 3.48 0.30 6 28.68 25.86 SECTION V. Conclusion During the process of pipeline irrigation using pressurizing electromechanical pumps, the pumps usually work in constant speed under fundamental frequency power supply and the operation characteristics of pumps could not be regulated to adapt the practical changes of pipe network in operation. In addition, when the irrigation area is large or the gradient of field is high, a constant pipe network pressure could not satisfy the requirement of irrigation uniformity in the whole field. The automatic water supply control system of graded constant pressure by variable frequency speed is based on traditional design method of pipeline irrigation system, combine the frequency conversion and automation technologies, and divide the field into irrigation subareas according to pressure rating. Each subarea delivers water automatically according to appropriate pressure rating, which can greatly enhance irrigation uniformity. Additionally, the system has good water and energy saving effect, high automation degree and easy operation and management. It can also protect the water pumps and the pipe network.

A systematic review of automated systems for real-time irrigation management

1. INTRODUCTION
The challenge of feeding a growing population with finite resources is becoming increasingly pressing. By 2050, the world population is expected to reach 9.7 billion, necessitating a 70% increase in food production (Falkenmark and Rockstrom, 2009). Irrigation plays a crucial role in enhancing crop yields and agricultural productivity to meet this growing demand. Studies have shown that irrigation can significantly increase crop water productivity, contributing to increased food production (Ali and Talukder, 2008; Playan and Mateos, 2005). However, water scarcity poses a significant challenge, with many regions facing water deficits and the need for improved water management practices (Falkenmark and Rockstrom, 2009). Optimizing irrigation schedules and doses based on crop requirements and environmental conditions is essential for maximizing yield and quality while minimizing water use (Zhang et al., 2024). The necessity of scalable water-efficient practices for increasing food demand cannot be overstated. Techniques such as regulated deficit irrigation, magnetically treated water, and the use of drought-tolerant crops like sorghum have shown promise in improving water productivity and ensuring food security (Mehmood et al., 2023; Putti et al., 2023; Hadebe et al., 2016). As the global food challenge intensifies, it is imperative to critically evaluate the current state and future potential of irrigation management systems to guide research, innovation, and implementation efforts towards fully autonomous, scalable solutions.

Despite the importance of irrigation in addressing the global food challenge, traditional irrigation management techniques, such as manual scheduling and timer-based systems, have significant limitations. These methods are often labor-intensive, inefficient, and less adaptable to changing conditions (Savin et al., 2023). Manual and timer-based scheduling can lead to high operational costs and inefficient water use (Raghavendra, Han, and Shin, 2023). The reliance on manual intervention and predetermined schedules limits their adaptability to changing environmental conditions, crop water requirements, and soil moisture levels (Kaptein et al., 2019). Sensor-based irrigation systems offer an alternative, enabling real-time adjustments based on soil water status measurements (Kaptein et al., 2019). However, the adoption of these systems in commercial settings has been limited, often requiring extensive input from researchers (Kim et al., 2014; Lea-Cox et al., 2018; Ristvey et al., 2018). The limitations of traditional irrigation management techniques highlight the need for scalable, automated solutions for greater efficiency in irrigation management. Automated systems that collect real-time data, analyze it, and make autonomous irrigation decisions can lead to improved water use efficiency and increased crop productivity (Champness et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2022). To fully understand the potential of automated systems, it is necessary to examine the automation of each part of the irrigation management pipeline and analyze the effectiveness and efficiency of integrated end-to-end solutions.

The emergence of smart irrigation management and IoT marks a significant shift from historical irrigation practices. Modern approaches rely on vast data and analysis algorithms, leveraging technologies such as remote sensing, sensor networks, weather data, and computational algorithms (Atanasov, 2023; Bellvert et al., 2023; Kumar et al., 2023). IoT plays a vital role in collecting vast amounts of data through sensors, data transmission, and tailored networks, enabling real-time monitoring and control of irrigation systems (Liakos, 2023; Zuckerman et al., 2024). These advancements in data collection and analysis have the potential to revolutionize irrigation management, allowing for more precise and efficient water use. However, challenges such as processing diverse data sources, data integration, and lack of integrated data analysis hamper the full benefit of IoT in irrigation management (Dave et al., 2023). The current fragmented approach in smart irrigation, focusing on individual components rather than the entire system, limits the potential for fully autonomous, real-time end-to-end irrigation management (Togneri et al., 2021). To address these challenges and fully realize the potential of smart irrigation management, there is a need for automating and integrating each section of the irrigation management pipeline, from sensor/weather data collection and transmission to processing, analysis, decision-making, and automated action (McKinion and Lemmon, 1985). This integration requires a thorough investigation of the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling seamless communication and compatibility between components within the automated irrigation management pipeline.

Machine learning (ML) plays a significant role in processing vast data, predicting plant stress, modeling climate effects, and optimizing irrigation in smart irrigation management systems. ML algorithms can analyze data collected from sensors and weather stations to determine optimal irrigation schedules (Vianny et al., 2022). However, the potential of ML is often constrained by manual steps, such as data interpretation, decision-making on irrigation timing and volume, and system adjustments. Automating ML integration to allow direct action from insights to irrigation execution, removing bottlenecks and achieving real-time adaptability, is crucial for fully autonomous irrigation management (Barzallo-Bertot et al., 2022). By integrating ML into automated systems, the irrigation management pipeline can become more seamless and efficient, enabling real-time decision-making and action based on data-driven insights. To achieve this level of automation and integration, it is essential to identify gaps and propose solutions for seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, aiming to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.

To achieve seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, interoperability and standardization are critical. Interoperability allows different system components, such as sensors, actuators, and software, to communicate and exchange data effectively, while standardization ensures that data is represented in a consistent format (Santos et al., 2020). Standardized protocols and data formats are essential for achieving seamless integration and ensuring compatibility between components in real-time irrigation management systems (Robles et al., 2022; Hatzivasilis et al., 2018). Existing and emerging standards, such as OGC SensorThings API and ISO 11783, have applicability to real-time irrigation management systems (Hazra et al., 2021). However, challenges such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security need to be addressed to fully realize the potential of interoperability and standardization in automated irrigation management systems (Hazra et al., 2021). Addressing these challenges is crucial for enabling the seamless integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline, which is essential for achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. A comprehensive evaluation of the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling the integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline is necessary to guide future research and implementation efforts.
The primary objective of this systematic review is to critically evaluate the current state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies for enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
Specific objectives include:
•	Examining the automation of each part of the irrigation management pipeline and the seamless integration of each section in the context of irrigation scheduling and management.

3. DATA COLLECTION TO CLOUD: AUTOMATION AND REAL-TIME PROCESSING
3.1. Irrigation management data
The success of automated irrigation management systems relies heavily on the collection, transmission, and analysis of various types of data. The most applicable data types for irrigation management include soil moisture, canopy temperature, weather data, and plant physiological parameters (Farooq et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Olivier et al., 2021; Evett et al., 2020). These data are typically collected from a range of sources, including in-field sensors, remote sensing platforms, weather stations, and manual measurements (Li et al., 2019; Karimi et al., 2018).
Soil moisture data is arguably the most critical type of data for irrigation management, as it directly reflects the water available to plants and can be used to determine the optimal timing and amount of irrigation (Olivier et al., 2021; Intrigliolo & Castel, 2006). Soil moisture sensors, such as tensiometers, capacitance probes, and time-domain reflectometry (TDR) sensors, can provide real-time measurements of soil water content at various depths (Farooq et al., 2019). These sensors can be deployed in a network configuration to capture spatial variability in soil moisture across a field (Karimi et al., 2018).
Canopy temperature data is another valuable type of data for irrigation management, as it can be used to assess plant water stress and adjust irrigation accordingly (Evett et al., 2020). Infrared thermometers and thermal cameras can be used to measure canopy temperature, which is influenced by factors such as air temperature, humidity, wind speed, and plant water status (Li et al., 2019). When plants experience water stress, they tend to close their stomata to reduce water loss, leading to an increase in canopy temperature (Evett et al., 2020). By monitoring canopy temperature and comparing it to reference values, automated irrigation systems can detect plant water stress and trigger irrigation events to maintain optimal plant health and productivity (Li et al., 2019).
Weather data, including temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, and solar radiation, are essential for predicting crop water requirements and scheduling irrigation events (Akilan & Baalamurugan, 2024). Weather stations equipped with various sensors can provide real-time measurements of these parameters, which can be used as inputs for crop water requirement models, such as the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith equation (Li et al., 2019). These models estimate crop evapotranspiration (ET) based on weather data and crop-specific coefficients, allowing for the calculation of irrigation requirements (Intrigliolo & Castel, 2006). By integrating weather data into automated irrigation systems, irrigation schedules can be dynamically adjusted based on changing environmental conditions, ensuring that crops receive the optimal amount of water at the right time (Akilan & Baalamurugan, 2024).
When collecting and utilizing these data types, several considerations must be taken into account, including the volume, frequency, format, and source of the data (Farooq et al., 2019). The volume of data generated by automated irrigation systems can be substantial, especially when high-resolution sensors are deployed at a large scale (Bastidas Pacheco et al., 2022). This necessitates the use of efficient data storage, processing, and transmission technologies to handle the data load (Farooq et al., 2019). The frequency of data collection is another important consideration, as it directly impacts the temporal resolution of the data and the ability to detect rapid changes in plant water status or environmental conditions (Bastidas Pacheco et al., 2022). Bastidas Pacheco et al. (2022) demonstrated that collecting full pulse resolution data from water meters provides more accurate estimates of event occurrence, timing, and features compared to aggregated temporal resolutions, highlighting the importance of selecting appropriate data collection frequencies to ensure the quality and usefulness of the data for irrigation management.
The format of the data is also crucial, as it determines the compatibility and interoperability of the data with various analysis tools and platforms (Farooq et al., 2019). Standardized data formats, such as JSON, XML, or CSV, can facilitate data exchange and integration between different components of the automated irrigation system (Zhang et al., 2023). The source of the data is another important consideration, as it can impact the reliability, accuracy, and spatial coverage of the data (Farooq et al., 2019). For example, in-field sensors provide highly localized measurements, while remote sensing platforms, such as satellites or drones, can provide data at larger spatial scales (Li et al., 2019). By combining data from multiple sources, automated irrigation systems can achieve a more comprehensive understanding of crop water requirements and optimize irrigation management accordingly (Farooq et al., 2019).
Data quality, accuracy, and reliability are paramount in irrigation management, as they directly impact the effectiveness of decision-making processes and the efficiency of water use (Gupta et al., 2020). Inaccurate or unreliable data can lead to suboptimal irrigation decisions, resulting in crop stress, yield losses, or wasted water resources (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022). Gupta et al. (2020) emphasized the critical importance of data security and privacy in smart farming systems, as the leakage of sensitive agricultural data can cause severe economic losses to farmers and compromise the integrity of the automated irrigation system. The authors also highlighted the need for robust authentication and secure communication protocols to prevent unauthorized access to smart farming systems and protect data in transit (Gupta et al., 2020).
Ramli and Jabbar (2022) addressed the challenges associated with implementing real-time, automated irrigation systems, including data quality, scalability, reliability, and security. They proposed solutions and best practices based on the analysis of case studies and real-world implementations, such as the use of redundant sensors, data validation techniques, and secure communication protocols (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022). The authors also emphasized the importance of regular maintenance and calibration of sensors to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the collected data (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022).
Researchers have investigated the use of data compression, aggregation, and filtering techniques to reduce bandwidth requirements and improve transmission efficiency in automated irrigation systems (Karim et al., 2023; Rady et al., 2020; Cui, 2023). Karim et al. (2023) explored the effectiveness of various data compression techniques, such as lossless and lossy compression algorithms, in reducing the size of data packets transmitted over wireless networks. The authors found that lossless compression techniques, such as Huffman coding and Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW), can significantly reduce data size without compromising data quality, while lossy compression techniques, such as JPEG and MP3, can further reduce data size by introducing acceptable levels of distortion (Karim et al., 2023).
Rady et al. (2020) developed a novel data compression algorithm specifically designed for irrigation data, which achieved significant compression ratios without compromising data quality. The authors demonstrated that their algorithm could reduce the amount of data transmitted over wireless networks, thereby improving the efficiency of the irrigation system and reducing costs (Rady et al., 2020). Cui (2023) investigated the use of data aggregation and filtering techniques to reduce the number of transmissions and save bandwidth in automated irrigation systems. The author proposed a data aggregation scheme that combines multiple sensor readings into a single value, such as the average soil moisture over a specified time interval, to reduce the frequency of data transmissions (Cui, 2023). Additionally, the author explored the use of data filtering techniques, such as Kalman filters and particle filters, to remove noise and outliers from sensor data, improving the accuracy and reliability of the transmitted information (Cui, 2023).
Data standardization and harmonization are crucial for facilitating seamless integration and interoperability between the various components of automated irrigation management systems (Zhang et al., 2023; Ermoliev et al., 2022). Zhang et al. (2023) developed a novel cyberinformatics technology called iCrop, which enables the in-season monitoring of crop-specific land cover across the contiguous United States. The authors highlighted the importance of data standardization and harmonization in the context of iCrop, as it allows for the efficient distribution of crop-specific land cover information based on the findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data principle (Zhang et al., 2023). By adopting standardized data formats and protocols, such as the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards, iCrop enables the seamless integration of various data sources and facilitates the interoperability of the system with other agricultural decision support tools (Zhang et al., 2023).
Ermoliev et al. (2022) proposed a linkage methodology for linking distributed sectoral/regional optimization models in a situation where private information is not available or cannot be shared by modeling teams. The authors emphasized the need for data standardization to enable decentralized cross-sectoral coordination and analysis, as it allows for the consistent representation and exchange of data between different models and stakeholders (Ermoliev et al., 2022). By adopting standardized data formats and interfaces, the proposed linkage methodology can facilitate the integration of various optimization models and support the development of comprehensive decision support systems for sustainable resource management (Ermoliev et al., 2022).
Metadata plays a vital role in providing context and enabling better data interpretation and decision-making in automated irrigation management systems (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021). Metadata refers to the additional information that describes the characteristics, quality, and context of the primary data, such as the sensor type, calibration parameters, measurement units, and timestamp (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021). Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al. (2021) highlighted the importance of metadata in water resources management, as it enables decision-makers to use the data to the best of its capabilities by understanding factors such as when water data was collected and what factors might have contributed to the measurements. The authors emphasized the need for standardized metadata formats and guidelines, such as the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) and the ISO 19115 standard, to ensure the consistency and interoperability of metadata across different water information systems (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021).
In the context of automated irrigation management systems, metadata can provide valuable information about the data collection process, sensor performance, and environmental conditions that can aid in data interpretation and decision-making (Cota & Mamede, 2023). For example, metadata about the sensor type and calibration parameters can help assess the accuracy and reliability of the collected data, while metadata about the weather conditions and soil properties can provide context for interpreting the data and adjusting irrigation strategies accordingly (Cota & Mamede, 2023). By incorporating metadata into the data management and analysis pipeline of automated irrigation systems, decision-makers can make more informed and context-aware decisions, leading to improved water use efficiency and crop productivity (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021).

3.2. Edge Computing and Fog Computing
Edge computing and fog computing have emerged as transformative technologies in the realm of real-time irrigation management systems, offering significant potential for improving efficiency, scalability, and reliability (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2019). Edge computing refers to the practice of processing data near the edge of the network, close to the source of the data, while fog computing is a decentralized computing infrastructure that extends cloud computing capabilities to the network edge (Hassija et al., 2019). These technologies bring computation and analytics closer to the data source, reducing the need for data to travel to the cloud and enabling faster processing and decision-making (Hassija et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020).
The potential of edge computing and fog computing in real-time irrigation management is immense. Abdel Nasser et al. (2020) proposed a two-layer system for water demand prediction using automated meters and machine learning techniques, demonstrating the potential of edge computing in improving the efficiency and scalability of irrigation management. The system collects and aggregates data from distributed smart meters in the first layer, while the second layer uses LSTM neural networks to predict water demand for different regions of households. By leveraging edge computing, the system can achieve high accuracy in predicting water demand, which is essential for efficient irrigation management (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020).
Tran et al. (2019) conducted a comprehensive review of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems, highlighting the role of fog computing in addressing data transmission challenges and enabling seamless integration across the irrigation management pipeline. The authors emphasize that real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems have the potential to significantly improve water efficiency, crop yields, and reduce labor costs. However, they also identify several challenges that need to be addressed, such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security, which can be effectively tackled by implementing fog computing architectures (Tran et al., 2019).
Edge computing offers several benefits in real-time irrigation management systems, including reduced latency, real-time decision-making, and reduced reliance on cloud connectivity (Mishra, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). By processing data closer to the source, edge computing enables faster response times and more efficient data handling (Mishra, 2020). Mishra (2020) highlights that edge computing reduces latency by processing data closer to the source, enabling real-time decision-making and lessening reliance on cloud connectivity by shifting processing to local or edge devices.
Zhang et al. (2020) explore the application of edge computing in agricultural settings, demonstrating its potential to improve the efficiency and accuracy of irrigation systems. The authors discuss how edge computing has prospects in various agricultural applications, such as pest identification, safety traceability of agricultural products, unmanned agricultural machinery, agricultural technology promotion, and intelligent management. They also emphasize that the emergence of edge computing models, such as fog computing, cloudlet, and mobile edge computing, has transformed the management and operation of farms (Zhang et al., 2020).
Fog computing plays a crucial role in distributing processing and storage across the network, enhancing the scalability and reliability of automated irrigation systems (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022; Singh et al., 2022). Premkumar and Sigappi (2022) evaluate the current state of automated irrigation management systems and propose a hybrid machine learning approach for predicting soil moisture and managing irrigation. Their study emphasizes the potential of fog computing in distributing processing and storage across the network, improving the efficiency and scalability of irrigation systems. The proposed hybrid machine learning approach outperforms other machine learning algorithms in predicting soil moisture, demonstrating the effectiveness of fog computing in enhancing the performance of automated irrigation systems (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022).
Singh et al. (2022) discuss the role of fog computing in distributing processing and storage across the network, enhancing scalability and reliability in agricultural management systems. The authors argue that by implementing fog computing, these systems can achieve faster data processing and response times, improving overall efficiency and effectiveness. They also highlight that fog computing can address the challenges faced by real-time data transmission in agricultural management systems, such as latency, bandwidth limitations, and data security (Singh et al., 2022).
The integration of edge and fog computing in real-time irrigation management systems is crucial for achieving fully automated, scalable, and reliable solutions. As the demand for autonomous irrigation management grows, these technologies will play a pivotal role in enabling faster decision-making, reduced latency, improved resource utilization, and seamless integration across the irrigation management pipeline (Tran et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020). By bringing computation and analytics closer to the data source and distributing processing and storage across the network, edge and fog computing can significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of automated irrigation systems, contributing to the overall goal of addressing the global food challenge through optimized water resource management and increased agricultural productivity (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022; Singh et al., 2022).

3.3. Automation of Data Collection
The automation of data collection is a critical component in the development of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies. It enables the efficient gathering of vital information about crop health, environmental conditions, and water requirements, which is essential for enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity. Two key aspects of automated data collection are the use of advanced sensing technologies for non-invasive plant stress detection and the implementation of wireless sensor networks and energy-efficient communication protocols for large-scale, long-term data collection.
Advanced sensing technologies, such as hyperspectral imaging and thermal sensing, have emerged as powerful tools for non-invasive plant stress detection in automated irrigation management systems. These technologies provide valuable information about crop traits, enabling early and accurate detection of plant health issues (Triantafyllou et al., 2019). Triantafyllou et al. (2019) propose a comprehensive reference architecture model that incorporates advanced sensing technologies in the sensor layer for real-time plant stress detection, highlighting their importance in providing non-invasive plant stress detection. Similarly, Hossain et al. (2023) present a novel IoT-ML-Blockchain integrated framework for smart agricultural management that leverages advanced sensing technologies to optimize water use and improve crop yield, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
Hyperspectral imaging can capture subtle changes in plant physiology that are indicative of stress, while machine learning algorithms can be employed to extract meaningful patterns from the spectral data and classify different stress types (Araus et al., 2014). Thermal sensing can detect changes in canopy temperature, which is influenced by factors such as plant water status (Li et al., 2019). By monitoring canopy temperature and comparing it to reference values, automated irrigation systems can detect plant water stress and trigger irrigation events to maintain optimal plant health and productivity (Li et al., 2019).
The integration of advanced sensing technologies in automated irrigation management systems has the potential to revolutionize precision agriculture. Jiang et al. (2019) demonstrate the effectiveness of a deep learning-based model in accurately detecting leaf spot diseases, highlighting the importance of image augmentation and deep learning algorithms in enhancing the model's performance.
Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and energy-efficient communication protocols have the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and reliability of data collection in large-scale, long-term irrigation systems. WSNs offer a cost-effective and scalable solution for real-time data collection in large-scale irrigation systems, providing remote monitoring and automated control capabilities (Mehdizadeh et al., 2020). Nishiura and Yamamoto (2021) propose a novel sensor network system that utilizes drones and wireless power transfer to autonomously collect environmental data from sensor nodes in vast agricultural fields, reducing operational costs and enhancing the efficiency of data collection. Similarly, Higashiura and Yamamoto (2021) introduce a network system that employs UAVs and LoRa communication to efficiently collect environmental data from sensor nodes distributed across large farmlands, optimizing data collection and reducing travel distance and time.
Energy-efficient communication protocols are crucial for ensuring reliable data transmission in challenging environmental conditions and extending the lifespan of sensor nodes (Mehdizadeh et al., 2020). Al-Ali et al. (2023) investigate the potential of WSNs and energy-efficient communication protocols for data collection in large-scale, long-term irrigation systems, discussing the challenges and opportunities of using these technologies to improve the efficiency and reliability of real-time data collection in irrigation management. Mehdizadeh et al. (2020) emphasize the need for careful consideration of factors such as data accuracy, energy consumption, and network reliability when designing effective WSNs for irrigation management, enabling timely irrigation decisions and improved crop yields.
The automation of data collection through the use of advanced sensing technologies and wireless sensor networks is essential for achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. By enabling non-invasive plant stress detection and large-scale, long-term data collection, these technologies contribute to the overall goal of optimizing water resource management and increasing agricultural productivity. The integration of these technologies in real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems has the potential to enhance agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity, ultimately contributing to the development of fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management solutions.

3.4: Real-Time Data Transmission Protocols and Technologies
Real-time data transmission is a critical component of automated irrigation management systems, as it enables the timely delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of suitable protocols and network architectures is essential for ensuring efficient and reliable data transmission in these systems, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
The Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol has emerged as a popular choice for real-time data transmission in IoT networks, including those used for automated irrigation management. MQTT is a lightweight, publish-subscribe protocol designed for constrained devices and low-bandwidth networks (Author, 2019). Its simplicity and low overhead make it well-suited for IoT applications where data transmission speed and energy efficiency are critical (Saranyadevi et al., 2022). MQTT provides three Quality of Service (QoS) levels, ensuring data reliability in real-time scenarios (Author, 2019). Chen et al. (2020) proposed novel algorithms to improve data exchange efficiency and handle rerouting in MQTT-based IoT networks for automated irrigation management systems. Their TBRouting algorithm efficiently finds the shortest paths for data transmission, while the Rerouting algorithm effectively handles the rerouting of topic-based session flows when a broker crashes. The combination of these algorithms can significantly improve the performance and reliability of automated irrigation management systems (Chen et al., 2020).
Client-server IoT networks, such as those based on MQTT, play a crucial role in real-time data transmission for automated irrigation management systems. In these networks, sensors and devices (clients) publish data to a central broker (server), which then distributes the data to subscribed clients (Verma et al., 2021). This architecture enables efficient data collection, processing, and dissemination, facilitating the integration of various components within the automated irrigation management pipeline. Verma et al. (2021) proposed an architecture for healthcare monitoring systems using IoT and communication protocols, which provides a comprehensive overview of existing approaches and highlights challenges and opportunities in the field. Although focused on healthcare, the insights from this study can be applied to automated irrigation management systems, emphasizing the importance of interoperability and standardization for seamless integration (Verma et al., 2021).
In addition to MQTT, other application layer protocols such as XMPP, CoAP, SOAP, and HTTP have been explored for real-time data transmission in IoT networks. Each protocol has its strengths and weaknesses, making them suitable for different applications and scenarios. XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) is an open-standard protocol that supports real-time messaging, presence, and request-response services (Saint-Andre, 2011). CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) is a specialized web transfer protocol designed for use with constrained nodes and networks in the Internet of Things (Shelby et al., 2014). SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services, while HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web (Fielding et al., 1999).
Motamedi and Villányi (2022) compared and evaluated wireless communication protocols for the implementation of smart irrigation systems in greenhouses, considering factors such as power consumption, range, reliability, and scalability. They found that ZigBee is the most suitable local communication protocol for greenhouse irrigation due to its large number of nodes and long range, while MQTT is the recommended messaging protocol for smart irrigation systems due to its TCP transport protocol and quality of service (QoS) options. GSM is a reliable and cost-effective global communication protocol for greenhouse irrigation, providing wide coverage and low cost (Motamedi & Villányi, 2022).
Syafarinda et al. (2018) investigated the use of the MQTT protocol in a precision agriculture system using a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). They found that MQTT is suitable for use in IoT applications due to its lightweight, simple, and low bandwidth requirements. The average data transmission speed using the MQTT protocol was approximately 1 second, demonstrating its effectiveness for real-time data transmission in precision agriculture systems (Syafarinda et al., 2018).
The choice of application layer protocol for real-time irrigation management depends on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. MQTT and RTPS (Real-Time Publish-Subscribe) are both suitable for real-time data transmission in IoT systems, but they have different strengths and weaknesses. MQTT is a better choice for applications that require low latency and high throughput, while RTPS is a better choice for applications that require high reliability and low latency (Sanchez-Iborra & Skarmeta, 2021). The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of various application layer protocols, provides valuable insights into the suitability of these technologies for real-time data transmission in automated irrigation management systems.
In summary, real-time data transmission protocols and technologies play a vital role in the automation of irrigation management systems, enabling the efficient and reliable delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of application layer protocols, highlights the importance of selecting suitable technologies based on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. By leveraging these technologies, automated irrigation management systems can achieve seamless integration and contribute to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.

3.5. Challenges and Solutions in Real-Time Data Transmission
Following the exploration of data collection, processing at the edge and fog, and automation in previous sections, we now turn to the critical aspect of real-time data transmission. While essential for automated irrigation management, this stage presents unique challenges that must be addressed to ensure system efficiency and reliability.
Obstacles in Real-Time Data Transmission
Agricultural environments present unique challenges for real-time data transmission, directly impacting the effectiveness of automated irrigation systems. Environmental factors can significantly disrupt wireless communication. Adverse weather conditions such as heavy rain, fog, and high winds can weaken or even block radio signals, leading to data loss and compromised system performance. Physical obstacles like trees, buildings, and uneven terrain further complicate signal propagation, creating reliability issues (Jukan et al., 2017; Yi & Ji, 2014; Zhang, Chang & Baoguo, 2018). These environmental challenges necessitate robust communication protocols and network architectures that can ensure consistent and reliable data flow.
In addition to environmental factors, technical limitations also present significant obstacles. Large-scale agricultural operations often demand long-distance data transmission, which can be hindered by the limited range of certain wireless communication protocols. Network congestion, occurring when multiple sensors transmit data concurrently, can lead to delays and potential data loss, further complicating real-time decision-making (Hameed et al., 2020). To mitigate these issues, researchers have investigated the potential of cognitive radio networks (CRNs) and dynamic spectrum access (DSA) for optimizing spectrum utilization and reducing interference (Righi et al., 2017; Shafi et al., 2018; Trigka & Dritsas, 2022). CRNs enable devices to intelligently sense and adapt to the surrounding radio environment, dynamically adjusting transmission parameters to avoid interference and improve communication efficiency. DSA, on the other hand, facilitates the dynamic allocation of unused spectrum, enhancing spectrum utilization and reducing congestion.
Furthermore, data security and privacy are paramount concerns in real-time irrigation systems. The sensitive nature of agricultural data, such as crop yields and farm management practices, necessitates robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches (Gupta et al., 2020). Implementing secure communication protocols, authentication mechanisms, and encryption techniques is essential to protect data integrity and ensure the trustworthiness of the system.
Investigating Data Optimization Techniques
To enhance the efficiency and reliability of real-time data transmission in automated irrigation systems, researchers have explored a range of data optimization techniques. Data compression techniques aim to reduce the size of data packets transmitted over the network, minimizing bandwidth requirements and improving transmission speed (Rady et al., 2020; Karim et al., 2023). Lossless compression algorithms, such as Huffman coding and LZW, preserve data integrity while effectively reducing data size, ensuring that no information is lost during transmission (Cui, 2023). Lossy compression algorithms, such as JPEG and MP3, offer higher compression ratios but introduce a controlled level of data loss, which may be acceptable for certain applications where some loss of precision is tolerable (Karim et al., 2023). The choice between lossless and lossy compression depends on the specific application and the trade-off between data size and accuracy.
Data aggregation techniques provide another effective approach to optimize data transmission. By aggregating multiple sensor readings into a single representative value, such as average soil moisture or temperature, the number of transmissions can be significantly reduced, conserving bandwidth and energy resources (Cui, 2023). This is particularly beneficial in large-scale irrigation systems where numerous sensors are deployed across vast areas, generating substantial amounts of data. Additionally, data filtering techniques play a crucial role in improving data quality and reliability. Kalman filters and particle filters can effectively remove noise and outliers from sensor data, ensuring that only accurate and relevant information is transmitted and used for decision-making (Cui, 2023). This is essential for preventing erroneous data from influencing irrigation decisions and potentially leading to suboptimal water management.
Sensor calibration, drift correction, and fault detection are essential for maintaining data accuracy and reliability (Dos Santos et al., 2023). Regular calibration ensures that sensors provide accurate measurements over time, while drift correction techniques account for gradual changes in sensor readings due to environmental factors or aging. Fault detection mechanisms can identify and address sensor malfunctions or anomalies, preventing erroneous data from influencing irrigation decisions and potentially harming crops or wasting water.
Addressing the Challenges
Effectively addressing the challenges in real-time data transmission requires a multifaceted approach that encompasses environmental, technical, and data-related considerations. Implementing robust and adaptive communication protocols is crucial for overcoming interference and signal degradation caused by weather conditions and physical obstacles. Selecting appropriate protocols, such as LoRa or ZigBee, with suitable range and penetration capabilities can ensure reliable data transmission in challenging agricultural environments (Motamedi & Villányi, 2022). Additionally, employing techniques like frequency hopping and error correction codes can further improve communication resilience and mitigate data loss.
Optimizing network architecture is another key consideration. Deploying a distributed network architecture with edge and fog computing capabilities can significantly enhance data processing and transmission efficiency (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2019). Edge devices can perform initial data processing and aggregation tasks, reducing the amount of data transmitted to the cloud and minimizing latency, while fog nodes can provide additional processing power and storage closer to the data source, enhancing scalability and reliability. This distributed approach alleviates the burden on the central cloud server and allows for more responsive and efficient irrigation management.
Data optimization techniques play a vital role in reducing bandwidth requirements and improving transmission efficiency. The choice of data compression, aggregation, and filtering techniques should be tailored to the specific requirements of the irrigation system, considering factors such as data type, accuracy needs, and available bandwidth. By carefully selecting and implementing these techniques, the overall performance and effectiveness of real-time irrigation systems can be significantly enhanced, leading to more sustainable water management practices and improved agricultural productivity.
By addressing these challenges and implementing appropriate solutions, real-time data transmission can become a reliable and efficient component of automated irrigation systems, contributing to the overall goal of achieving sustainable and productive agriculture in the face of growing food demands and water scarcity.

3.6. IoT Network Architectures and Variable Rate Irrigation (VRI) for Real-Time Irrigation
Real-time irrigation management systems heavily rely on the efficient and reliable transmission of data from sensors and weather stations to the cloud for processing and decision-making. However, agricultural environments present unique challenges to wireless communication, including adverse weather conditions, physical obstacles, and the limitations of wireless technologies. These challenges necessitate robust and adaptive solutions to ensure the consistent and timely flow of data, enabling truly autonomous irrigation scheduling.
Environmental factors, such as heavy rain, fog, and strong winds, can significantly disrupt wireless communication by attenuating or even blocking radio signals, leading to data loss and compromised system performance (Ed-daoudi et al., 2023; Jukan et al., 2017; Yi & Ji, 2014; Zhang, Chang & Baoguo, 2018). Dense vegetation, buildings, and uneven terrain create further complications by causing multipath propagation and shadowing effects (Yim et al., 2018; Gautam and Pagay, 2020). The study by Yim et al. (2018) on LoRa networks in a tree farm environment exemplifies these challenges, revealing reduced communication range and data reliability compared to theoretical expectations. This underscores the need for carefully selecting and optimizing communication protocols and network parameters to ensure reliable data transmission in such environments.
The study by Guzinski et al. (2014a) using a modified TSEB model further highlights the importance of high-resolution data in accurately capturing the spatial and temporal dynamics of energy fluxes influenced by environmental factors. This emphasizes the need for advanced data acquisition and processing techniques that can effectively represent the complexities of agricultural settings.
The limitations of traditional wireless communication technologies, such as limited range and network congestion, pose additional challenges for large-scale agricultural operations. Long-distance data transmission can be hindered by range limitations, while network congestion arising from numerous sensors transmitting concurrently can lead to delays and data loss, hindering real-time decision-making (Hameed et al., 2020). Addressing these challenges requires the exploration of advanced networking technologies that can optimize spectrum utilization, mitigate interference, and improve reliability and efficiency.
Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) and Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) offer promising solutions for optimizing wireless communication in agricultural settings. CRNs empower devices with the ability to intelligently sense and adapt to the surrounding radio environment, dynamically adjusting transmission parameters to avoid interference and improve communication efficiency (Righi et al., 2017; Shafi et al., 2018; Trigka & Dritsas, 2022). Research has explored the potential of CRNs in predicting Radio Frequency (RF) power to avoid noisy channels and optimize spectrum utilization (Iliya et al., 2014; Iliya et al., 2014). These studies demonstrate the effectiveness of combining optimization algorithms with artificial neural networks (ANNs) to enhance the accuracy and generalization of RF power prediction, enabling CRNs to make informed decisions about channel selection and avoid interference.
DSA complements CRN technology by dynamically allocating unused spectrum, further enhancing spectrum utilization and reducing congestion (Shi et al., 2023). The numerical model developed by Shi et al. (2023) showcases the potential of CRNs and DSA for optimizing wireless communication in challenging environments.
The integration of CRNs and DSA into the IoT network architecture requires careful consideration of spectrum sensing techniques, network topology, and data security. Research on cooperative spectrum sensing suggests that distributed approaches, where sensor nodes collaborate and share information, can significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of spectrum sensing, particularly in dynamic environments (Trigka and Dritsas, 2022; Khalid & Yu, 2019). This collaborative approach enables a more comprehensive understanding of the radio environment and facilitates the identification of available frequency bands for data transmission.
The choice of network topology also impacts the performance and scalability of CRN-based irrigation systems. Mesh networks, where sensor nodes are interconnected and relay data for each other, offer enhanced resilience and coverage compared to star topologies where nodes communicate directly with a central gateway (Akyildiz & Vuran, 2010). However, mesh networks can be more complex to manage and may introduce additional routing overhead. The trade-off between network resilience and complexity needs to be carefully evaluated to select the most appropriate topology for a specific agricultural setting.
Data security and privacy are paramount concerns in IoT-based irrigation systems due to the sensitive nature of agricultural data (Gupta et al., 2020). Implementing secure communication protocols, authentication mechanisms, and encryption techniques is essential for protecting data integrity and ensuring system trustworthiness. Research on secure spectrum leasing and resource allocation algorithms for CR-WSN-based irrigation systems has demonstrated the potential of these technologies for enhancing security and efficiency (Hassan, 2023; Afghah et al., 2018).
In conclusion, the development of effective and reliable real-time irrigation management systems requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the challenges of data transmission in agricultural environments. The integration of robust and adaptive communication protocols, optimized network architectures, and advanced networking technologies like CRNs and DSA, along with a focus on data security and privacy, can contribute significantly to achieving the goal of autonomous and efficient irrigation scheduling.
4. AUTOMATED DATA PROCESSING IN THE CLOUD
4.1. Data Quality and Preprocessing
Data quality is paramount in automated irrigation systems as it directly influences the effectiveness of decision-making and water use efficiency. Issues like missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers arising from sensor malfunctions, environmental interference, or network problems (Lv et al., 2023) can significantly impact the performance of machine learning models used for irrigation scheduling and management.
Real-time data cleaning techniques are essential for addressing these challenges. Kalman filtering proves particularly effective in handling missing values and correcting erroneous readings by recursively estimating the system's state based on previous measurements and current sensor data, taking into account noise and uncertainty (Kim et al., 2020). Moving average techniques, by averaging consecutive data points, provide a more stable representation of the underlying trend, filtering out short-term fluctuations (Chhetri, 2023). For outlier detection, adaptive thresholding methods offer a dynamic approach, adjusting thresholds based on the statistical properties of the data to effectively identify anomalies and minimize false positives (Bah et al., 2021). These techniques are crucial in maintaining the integrity of real-time data streams and ensuring the accuracy of subsequent analyses.
Adaptive data preprocessing is essential for managing the diversity of data sources and formats commonly found in irrigation systems. Data normalization techniques, such as min-max scaling or z-score normalization, ensure that all features contribute equally to the analysis by transforming data values to a common scale (Pradal et al., 2016). This is crucial for preventing features with larger values from dominating the analysis and ensuring that all features are given equal consideration. Similarly, feature scaling methods, like standardization or normalization, optimize the range of feature values to improve the performance and convergence of machine learning models (Tortorici et al., 2024). By scaling features to a similar range, the influence of outliers is reduced, and the model's ability to learn from the data is enhanced.
Data fusion techniques play a critical role in integrating information from diverse sources, creating a more comprehensive and reliable dataset for irrigation management. Dempster-Shafer theory, a generalization of probability theory, allows for the expression of both uncertainty and the degree of conflict in evidence, making it suitable for fusing uncertain and conflicting data from heterogeneous sources (Sadiq and Rodriguez, 2004). This is particularly relevant in irrigation systems where data from different sensors may provide slightly different or even contradictory information due to sensor variations or environmental factors. Bayesian inference offers another powerful framework for combining information from multiple sources, updating the probability of a hypothesis as new evidence becomes available. By applying these techniques, data from soil moisture sensors, canopy temperature sensors, weather stations, and other sources can be integrated to provide a holistic understanding of crop water requirements and environmental conditions, leading to more informed and accurate irrigation decisions.
The impact of data quality extends beyond model accuracy to the robustness of machine learning models under varying conditions. Robust models should maintain consistent performance even when faced with data inconsistencies or unexpected situations. Techniques like data augmentation and domain adaptation can enhance model robustness by exposing the model to a wider range of data variations during training. Data augmentation involves generating additional training data by applying transformations or introducing noise to existing data, making the model more resilient to noise and variations in the real-world data. Domain adaptation techniques aim to adapt a model trained on one domain (e.g., a specific crop or geographic location) to perform well on another domain with different data characteristics. This is particularly relevant in irrigation management, where models may need to be applied to different crops, soil types, or climatic conditions.
The choice of data cleaning, preprocessing, and fusion techniques should be carefully considered based on the specific characteristics of the irrigation system and the available data. By selecting and implementing appropriate techniques, the accuracy, reliability, and robustness of machine learning models can be significantly improved, leading to more efficient and sustainable irrigation management practices.
4.2. Scalable and Autonomous Deployment using Containerization Strategies
The transition from data collection and transmission to efficient data processing requires a robust infrastructure capable of handling diverse workloads and data volumes. Containerization technologies, specifically Docker and Kubernetes, offer a promising solution for deploying and scaling data processing and machine learning modules within cloud environments like AWS, Azure, and GCP (Vargas-Rojas et al., 2024; Rosendo et al., 2022; Solayman & Qasha, 2023). Docker provides a standardized way to package applications and their dependencies into self-contained units known as containers, ensuring consistent and reproducible execution across different platforms (Rosendo et al., 2022). Kubernetes, acting as a container orchestrator, manages their deployment, scaling, and networking across a cluster of machines (Rosendo et al., 2022). This combination presents several advantages for automated irrigation management systems.
Firstly, containerization facilitates efficient resource utilization and scalability. By encapsulating applications and their dependencies, containers enable the isolation of resources and prevent conflicts between different modules (Vargas-Rojas et al., 2024; Solayman & Qasha, 2023). This isolation allows for the efficient allocation of resources, such as CPU, memory, and storage, to each container based on its specific needs. Kubernetes further enhances scalability by allowing for the automatic scaling of containers based on real-time demand, ensuring the system can adapt to varying workloads and data volumes, preventing bottlenecks, and ensuring responsiveness to changing conditions (Karamolegkos et al., 2023).
Secondly, containerization promotes portability and reproducibility. By packaging applications and their dependencies into a single unit, containers make it easy to move and deploy them across different cloud environments without the need for environment-specific configurations (Rosendo et al., 2022; Solayman & Qasha, 2023). This portability simplifies the development and deployment process, reducing the time and effort required to set up and manage the system. Additionally, containers ensure reproducibility by providing a consistent execution environment, regardless of the underlying infrastructure. This eliminates variability and ensures that the system will behave consistently across different deployments (Zhou et al., 2023).
Optimizing container orchestration and resource allocation is crucial to minimizing latency and maximizing throughput in real-time data processing pipelines. Techniques like auto-scaling and dynamic resource allocation play a critical role in this context (Hethcoat et al., 2024; Werner and Tai, 2023; Kumar et al., 2024). Auto-scaling automatically adjusts the number of container instances based on real-time demand, ensuring that sufficient resources are available to handle peak workloads while avoiding over-provisioning during periods of low demand (Hethcoat et al., 2024; Kumar et al., 2024). Dynamic resource allocation enables the fine-grained adjustment of resources allocated to each container based on its specific needs and the current workload (Werner and Tai, 2023). This ensures efficient resource allocation and provides each container with the necessary resources to perform its tasks effectively.
Performance monitoring tools, such as Kubernetes Metrics Server and Prometheus, are essential for gaining insights into the performance of containers and the overall system (Hethcoat et al., 2024; Kuity & Peddoju, 2023). These tools provide valuable data on key performance indicators, such as CPU and memory usage, network traffic, and application-specific metrics. By monitoring this data, administrators can identify bottlenecks, optimize resource allocation strategies, and continuously improve system performance (Hethcoat et al., 2024). This data-driven approach ensures that automated irrigation management systems can operate efficiently and reliably.
By integrating containerization technologies with optimization techniques and performance monitoring, automated irrigation management systems achieve the scalability, autonomy, and efficiency required for effective real-time data processing and decision-making. This approach facilitates a seamless and responsive system that can adapt to changing conditions and contribute to the overall goal of optimizing water resource management and increasing agricultural productivity.

4.3. Deploying ML Models for Data Processing
Transitioning from data collection, preprocessing, and transmission, the deployment of machine learning (ML) models marks a pivotal stage in the automated irrigation management pipeline. This stage entails utilizing cloud platforms to facilitate real-time data processing and inference, enabling data-driven decision-making for optimal irrigation management and ultimately contributing to fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.
Several architectures and frameworks exist for deploying ML models on cloud platforms, each offering unique advantages and catering to different requirements. TensorFlow Serving, for instance, provides a high-performance system specifically designed for serving TensorFlow models (Abadi et al., 2016). This framework enables efficient and scalable inference, making it suitable for real-time applications where low latency and high throughput are crucial. For instance, in a large-scale irrigation system with numerous sensors generating data continuously, TensorFlow Serving can efficiently handle the high volume of inference requests and provide timely predictions for irrigation scheduling. Similarly, Apache MXNet Model Server offers a flexible and efficient solution for deploying models trained with MXNet, supporting a wide range of deep learning models and inference backends (MXNet Developers, 2015). This versatility makes it suitable for complex irrigation systems that may utilize different types of ML models for various tasks, such as predicting crop water requirements, detecting plant stress, or forecasting weather conditions. ONNX Runtime, on the other hand, provides a cross-platform inference engine compatible with various ML frameworks, including PyTorch, TensorFlow, and MXNet (Microsoft, 2017). This versatility enables the deployment of models in diverse environments, facilitating interoperability and reducing the need for model conversion. For example, an irrigation system that uses models trained in different frameworks can utilize ONNX Runtime to deploy them on a single platform without the need for time-consuming and error-prone model conversion processes.
Choosing the appropriate architecture or framework depends on several factors, including the specific ML framework used for model training, the desired level of performance and scalability, and the need for cross-platform compatibility. For instance, if the primary concern is low latency and high throughput for real-time inference, TensorFlow Serving might be the optimal choice for TensorFlow models. However, if flexibility and support for various deep learning models are required, Apache MXNet Model Server could be more suitable. In cases where cross-platform compatibility is essential, ONNX Runtime offers a versatile solution.
Once the ML model is deployed, optimizing its performance and resource utilization becomes crucial for ensuring the efficiency of integrated end-to-end automated irrigation systems. Model compression techniques, such as pruning and quantization, offer effective methods for reducing the size and computational requirements of ML models without compromising accuracy (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). Pruning involves eliminating unnecessary connections or neurons from the model, effectively streamlining its structure and reducing computational complexity. This can be particularly beneficial for deep learning models, which often have a large number of parameters and can be prone to overfitting. By removing redundant or less important connections, pruning can improve modelgeneralizability and reduce inference time. Quantization, on the other hand, involves reducing the precision of model parameters, typically from 32-bit floating-point numbers to lower-precision formats such as 8-bit integers. This reduction in precision leads to smaller model sizes and faster inference speeds, making it particularly beneficial for resource-constrained environments or real-time applications. For instance, in edge computing scenarios where ML models are deployed on devices with limited computational resources, quantization can enable efficient inference without sacrificing accuracy.
Furthermore, hardware acceleration through the utilization of GPUs or TPUs can significantly enhance model performance by leveraging specialized hardware designed for parallel processing (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). GPUs, with their massive parallelism and high memory bandwidth, excel at accelerating matrix operations and convolutions, which are fundamental computations in many deep learning models. This acceleration can significantly reduce inference time and enable real-time processing of sensor data for timely irrigation decisions. TPUs, specifically designed for deep learning workloads, offer even greater performance and energy efficiency for specific model architectures. These hardware accelerators can drastically reduce inference time, enabling near real-time decision-making and enhancing the responsiveness of automated irrigation systems. For example, in a scenario where immediate response to changing weather conditions or soil moisture levels is critical, hardware acceleration can ensure that irrigation decisions are made and executed promptly.
In addition to model compression and hardware acceleration, distributed training techniques play a crucial role in optimizing the training process for large-scale ML models. Techniques such as Horovod and BytePS enable the distribution of training across multiple machines, effectively parallelizing the process and reducing training time (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). This is particularly beneficial for complex models with a large number of parameters or when dealing with large datasets. By leveraging distributed training, irrigation management systems can train more sophisticated models and improve their predictive capabilities, leading to more accurate and efficient irrigation decisions. For instance, a system that utilizes a deep learning model with millions of parameters can benefit from distributed training to reduce training time from days to hours, enabling faster model iteration and improvement.
Integrating the deployed ML models with other components of the automated irrigation management pipeline is essential for achieving a fully autonomous and cohesive system and addressing the need for seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system. Standardized protocols, such as MQTT and CoAP, provide lightweight and efficient communication channels for exchanging data between these components (Poojara et al., 2023; Jimenez et al., 2020a; Gour et al., 2023). MQTT, with its publish-subscribe architecture, enables real-time data streaming and event-driven communication, making it suitable for transmitting sensor data, control signals, and inference results (Raikar & M, 2023). This enables the ML model to receive real-time updates on soil moisture, weather conditions, and plant health, allowing for dynamic adjustments to irrigation schedules based on the latest data. CoAP, designed for constrained devices and low-power networks, offers a web-transfer protocol for resource-constrained environments, enabling efficient communication between sensors, actuators, and the ML models (Raikar & M, 2023). This is particularly relevant in situations where sensors or actuators have limited processing power or battery life, as CoAP minimizes communication overhead and energy consumption. Additionally, RESTful APIs provide a standardized interface for accessing and controlling the ML models, enabling seamless integration with other software components and facilitating system management and monitoring (Wang et al., 2022). This allows for easy integration with existing farm management systems or third-party applications, creating a unified platform for comprehensive irrigation management.4.4. Online Learning in the Cloud
The complexities of real-time data processing in irrigation management necessitate the exploration of advanced techniques to continuously learn and adapt to the dynamic nature of agricultural environments. Online learning algorithms offer a promising solution, enabling the continuous update and improvement of machine learning models based on incoming real-time data. This adaptability is crucial for addressing the challenges of changing environmental conditions, such as weather patterns and crop growth stages, and optimizing irrigation decision-making to enhance water usage efficiency and crop productivity.
Several online learning algorithms have demonstrated potential for real-time data processing and model adaptation in the context of irrigation management. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) facilitates the incremental update of model parameters with each new data point, allowing for efficient adaptation to changing data distributions (Bottou, 2010). This incremental learning process ensures that the model remains responsive to the latest conditions, minimizing the risk of outdated predictions and improving the accuracy of irrigation decisions. Passive-Aggressive algorithms, on the other hand, adjust model parameters only when a misclassification occurs, providing a computationally efficient approach for handling large data streams (Crammer et al., 2006). These algorithms offer a robust approach to handling noisy data, a common challenge in real-world sensor readings, by making small adjustments only when the model's prediction deviates significantly from the actual value (Fei et al., 2019). Online Random Forests extend the concept of random forests to the online setting, enabling the incremental construction and update of decision trees as new data arrives (Saffari et al., 2009). The continuous evolution of the ensemble ensures that the model remains relevant to the changing environment, capturing intricate relationships between variables and leading to more informed irrigation decisions.
Research in various domains highlights the importance of online learning for real-time data stream analytics. Snyder et al. (2020) explored the application of online learning techniques for identifying relevant tweets in real-time, improving situational awareness for first responders. The proposed interactive learning framework allows users to continuously label the relevance of incoming tweets, enabling the real-time refinement of the underlying machine learning model. This user-guided approach aligns well with the dynamic nature of irrigation management, where models need to continuously adjust to varying environmental conditions and crop water requirements. Similarly, research in the field of cyber-physical systems (CPS) underscores the need for online learning algorithms to effectively extract insights and knowledge from continuously generated data streams (Fei et al., 2019). These capabilities are crucial for enabling feedback loops between physical processes and cyber elements, facilitating the integration and optimization of CPS in irrigation management systems.
To implement online learning in cloud-based irrigation management systems, various architectures and frameworks can be considered. Apache Spark Streaming, Apache Flink, and AWS Kinesis provide scalable and fault-tolerant platforms for processing real-time data streams, allowing for the development of online learning pipelines that continuously ingest and analyze data to update machine learning models (Zaharia et al., 2012; Carbone et al., 2015; Amazon Web Services, 2023). These frameworks leverage serverless computing paradigms, automatically scaling resources based on the volume and velocity of incoming data, ensuring efficient resource utilization and responsiveness to fluctuations in demand (Fei et al., 2019).
Effectively managing the exploration-exploitation trade-off is crucial for optimizing online learning in irrigation management. Techniques such as Multi-armed bandits (Sutton & Barto, 2018), Bayesian optimization (Shahriari et al., 2016), and Reinforcement Learning (RL) (Sutton & Barto, 2018) can be employed to balance the allocation of resources between exploring new irrigation strategies and exploiting the current best-performing approaches. These techniques enable the identification of optimal irrigation policies, adapting to changing environmental conditions and maximizing long-term rewards.
In conclusion, online learning techniques, coupled with scalable cloud-based architectures, offer a powerful solution for real-time data processing and continuous adaptation in irrigation management systems. By leveraging algorithms like SGD, Passive-Aggressive, and Online Random Forests, along with stream processing frameworks like Apache Spark Streaming, Apache Flink, and AWS Kinesis, irrigation management systems can effectively handle the complexities of real-time data, optimize water usage, and enhance crop productivity in the face of dynamic environmental conditions.

5. GENERATING AND APPLYING IRRIGATION INSIGHTS 
5.1. Real-Time Generation of Actionable Irrigation Insights
The transition from data collection and processing to actionable irrigation insights requires the extracting spatial features from images, allowing for the analysis of satellite or drone imagery to assess crop health, detect water stress, and provide insights into irrigation needs (Os deployment of advanced predictive models capable of generating precise and site-specific irrigation recommendations.roosh et al., 2016).
Furthermore, the integration Deep learning models, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and of data from diverse sources, including IoT sensors and cloud-based platforms, plays Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have demonstrated excellent performance in capturing complex relationships a critical role in enhancing the accuracy and resolution of real-time irrigation insights. Data fusion techniques, such as Kalman filtering, offer a robust approach for combining information between input variables and predicting crop water requirements (Keller, 2023; Naphade et al., 2022). These models can effectively from multiple sensors, accounting for noise and uncertainty, and providing a more comprehensive understanding of crop water requirements (Cohen et al., 2005; Mö handle the temporal dependencies present in time-series data, such as soil moisture andeller et al., 2007). By integrating data from soil moisture weather data, and learn to predict future water needs based on historical patterns and current sensors, weather stations, and remote sensing platforms, ML models can generate more accurate conditions. Ensemble methods, such as Random Forests, also offer a robust approach to and site-specific irrigation recommendations, leading to improved water use efficiency and crop productivity prediction by combining multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce the risk of overfitting.
The heterogeneity, uncertainty, and quality issues inherent in real-time data streams require careful consideration and the implementation of effective strategies to ensure the reliability of generated (Singh et al., 2016).
The integration of irrigation insights. Data preprocessing techniques, such as outlier detection and missing value imputation, IoT sensor data with cloud-based data sources is crucial for enhancing the accuracy and resolution of irrigation insights. IoT sensors, such as soil moisture probes and weather stations are essential for preparing the data for analysis and preventing erroneous data from influencing the model, provide real-time, localized data on crop and environmental conditions, while cloud's predictions (Fiksel, 2003). Additionally,-based sources, such as weather forecasts and satellite imagery, offer broader spatial and the selection of appropriate ML models and data fusion techniques should be tailored to the specific temporal perspectives (López-Morales et al., 2020). characteristics of the irrigation system and the available data to mitigate uncertainty and ensure the robustness Data fusion techniques, such as Kalman filtering, play a critical role in combining these of generated insights.
To address computational complexity and latency challenges in real-time irrigation insight generation, techniques such as edge computing, model compression, and hardware accelerators heterogeneous data sources to generate more accurate and comprehensive irrigation recommendations (Cohen et al., offer promising solutions. Edge computing enables the distribution of processing tasks closer to the data 2005; Möeller et al., 2007 source, reducing latency and enabling faster response times (Mishra, 20). By incorporating data from multiple sources, irrigation models can better account for spatial variability20; Zhang et al., 2020). Model compression techniques, such as pruning and quantization, can significantly reduce the size and computational requirements of in soil moisture, microclimate conditions, and crop water requirements, leading to more ML models without compromising accuracy, making them suitable for deployment on resource-constrained edge precise and efficient irrigation scheduling.
The seamless integration of ML-generated insights with IoT-enabled irrigation control systems requires the adoption of appropriate architectures and protocols that facilitate devices (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). Hardware lightweight, real-time communication. The Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT accelerators, such as GPUs and TPUs, provide specialized hardware designed for parallel processing) protocol and the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) are well-suited, enabling faster inference speeds and facilitating real-time data analysis (Premkumar for this purpose, offering efficient and reliable communication channels for exchanging data between sensors, & Sigappi, 2022). The combined utilization of these techniques can significantly improve the efficiency and responsiveness of real-time irrigation insight generation, contributing actuators, and ML models (Muangprathub et al., 2019; Osroosh et al., 2016). to the overall goal of achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.
The implementation MQTT's publish-subscribe architecture enables real-time data streaming and event- of these strategies and techniques for real-time generation of actionable irrigation insights provides a solid foundation for developing automated and data-driven irrigation management systems that can effectively addressdriven communication, while CoAP's lightweight design and low overhead make it suitable the global food challenge by optimizing water resource utilization and maximizing agricultural productivity.
for resource-constrained devices and low-bandwidth networks. By utilizing these protocols, irrigation systems can achieve seamless integration between ML models and IoT devices, enabling the automated application of irrigation insights based on real-time data and predictions.
Industry-leading products and services for smart irrigation demonstrate the practical application of these technologies. Smart irrigation controllers, such as Rachio, leverage weather data and soil moisture sensors to automatically adjust irrigation schedules based on real-time conditions, reducing water waste and promoting water conservation (Verdouw et al., 2023). Cloud-based irrigation management platforms, such as CropX, offer advanced analytics and decision support tools, providing farmers with insights into crop water requirements, soil health, and irrigation performance (Weikmann et al., 2023). These platforms often incorporate machine learning algorithms to generate predictive models and provide farmers with data-driven recommendations for optimizing irrigation strategies.
The analysis of these products and services highlights the growing trend toward data-driven, automated irrigation management. By integrating IoT, machine learning, and cloud computing, these solutions enable farmers to make more informed and efficient irrigation decisions, contributing to the overall goal of achieving sustainable and productive agriculture.

For this reason, irrigation scheduling is an important and difficult task. The use of an irrigation control tray with two electrodes (level sensor) is a simple way for controlling irrigation. Irrigation operation is triggered when the water level in the tray decreases below a preset level. This is a simple on-off control but inflexible because it requires periodic manually calibrations. This work aims at developing a more efficient control system for the irrigation management of soilless culture. The control system is based on a Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) algorithm and it allows for fully automatic operation with a minimum set of variables in order to reduce the cost of the equipment. The results obtained demonstrate that the PID control algorithm can efficiently be used to control irrigation in soilless culture. The calculated average daily leaching fractions fit reasonably well to the target values. Nevertheless, some improvements of the control algorithm are required to reduce the variability of the calculated leaching fractions during the initial stage of crop development.

Currently, these systems remain a relevant typology in the European Union (EU) member states of the Mediterranean areas, where it is often the only sustainable method for farmers due to the small size of agricultural holdings, their reduced capacity and readiness to invest and the low ratio between yield profits and irrigation costs. In the last several years, in response to European and national directives, surface irrigation has garnered increasing attention at the political and bureaucratic levels due to frequent criticisms of its postulated low efficiency and high water wastage. However, these systems commonly provide a number of ecosystem services and nature-based solutions that increase the positive externalities in different rural socio-ecological contexts and often have the potential to extend these services and provide solutions that are compatible with economical sustainability. This study aims to discuss the prospects for new practices and for the rehabilitation and modernization of the gravity-fed surface irrigation systems in EU Mediterranean areas to enhance water efficiency, thus gaining both economic advantages and environmental benefits. The difficulties, stimuli for improvements and peculiarities of the irrigation water management of four rural environments located in Italy, Spain and Portugal were analyzed and compared to the current state of the gravity-fed surface irrigation systems with hypothetical future improvements achievable by innovative technologies and practices. In these different case studies, the current gravity-fed surface irrigation systems have an obsolete regulatory structure; water-use efficiency is not a driving criterion for the management of the conveyance and distribution canal network, and farmers are not yet adequately encouraged to adopt more efficient gravity-fed irrigation practices. A continuous knowledge exchange is thus necessary for the interaction of all irrigation water managers and farmers to improve their eco-efficiency and to preserve and promote their cultural heritage across the entire water supply and delivery chains. We argue that the best way forward will require precisely targeted rehabilitation measures of gravity-fed surface irrigation systems based on the integrated use of decision support services, gate automation, remote and feedback controls and real-time flow optimization. Keywords: gravity-fed surface irrigation systems; irrigation network; irrigation policy; water multi-functionality; irrigated agriculture sustainability 1. Introduction Irrigation practices in Europe have traditionally consisted of gravity-fed surface irrigation systems. In these cases, the water is conveyed from surface sources (primarily rivers or reservoirs, both natural and artificial) and is distributed to individual fields through a network of canals of different sizes, relying on gravity as the driving force. In sizeable areas of the southern Member States, especially in Catalonia, Northern Italy and Portugal, gravity-fed surface irrigation remains the dominant form of irrigation, being used in 51%, 70% and 63% of farms, respectively [1]. The main cultivated crops are cereals, particularly maize and rice, which require approximately two to three times the amount of water compared with other extensive crops [2]. The utilized agricultural area (UAA) in these states accounts for approximately 40% of the total land area, resulting in an average size of 16.1 ha per agricultural holding. The mean field size is approximately 5 ha, with a high level of fragmentation that affects the labor decisions of farmers, and consequently, the performances of farms [3]. Since the Renaissance, the hectic development of a dense network of gravity-fed surface irrigation canals for water delivery to single agricultural fields has occurred, mainly due to the high level of land fragmentation and small field sizes [4]. However, the lack of coordination among water users caused redundancy in these canals, leading to a chaotic structure, complex layout, and a lack of a specific hierarchy [5]. Nevertheless, the complex system of reservoirs, rivers, and irrigation canals that is common in rural Southern European territories is an emblematic model of hydraulic infrastructures, and although it can be perceived as obsolete, in general, it is operationally efficient and helps to maintain the good environmental status of the natural resources in several ways [6,7,8]. The majority of the irrigation canals are unlined and resemble small natural rivers rather than artificial infrastructures that support agriculture; this facilitates their integration into the landscape and gives them an environmental value as well as a cultural heritage [9,10,11]. As the largest user of fresh water, agriculture sits at the interface between the environment and society, and any improvements in irrigation water management need to consider its multifunctional nature [12,13,14]. The history of irrigation in these territories is inseparable from that of land management, and every change in the gravity-fed surface irrigation systems, even in a small area, can affect the hydrologic balance and agro-ecosystem characteristics on a large scale [15,16]. The neoclassical concept of irrigation efficiency (based on supply efficiency only) has been replaced by a modern formulation called “effective efficiency” of irrigation [17,18,19], which includes the abovementioned hydrological issues as well as environmental and ecological interactions. In light of these considerations, it is important to promote monitoring activities for accurately quantifying agro-environmental variables from climatic parameters to evaluate the flow into the irrigation canals (from the main canals to distribution ditches). In fact, the lack of data about the flow in rural canals is a central issue in planning and decision-making processes for the development of suitable water resource management strategies at the basin level [20,21,22,23]. This problem could also be exacerbated by an increase in the total global water withdrawals for irrigation, which are projected to increase by 10% by 2050 [24]. Strong competition between the irrigation water resources, energy, agriculture and food are looming, with unpredictable impacts on livelihoods and the environment [25]. Thus, cross-sectoral actions such as those oriented by the Water-Energy-Food Security nexus [26] or Water-Food-Energy-Ecosystem nexus [27] will also affect future irrigation system projects and water allocations to promote more efficient water distribution and prevent waste. This study analyzed the characteristics and the importance of the gravity-fed surface irrigation systems in four irrigation districts belonging to three states in southern Europe (the Est Ticino-Villoresi districts in Italy, the Baix Ter and the Urgell districts in Spain, and the Lis Valley district in Portugal). The prospects and difficulties around the possibility of improving the irrigation throughout these systems as well as their management and governance are compared and discussed. We argue that this study may form the basis for a discussion on the recommended improvements on gravity-fed surface irrigation systems that would preserve their agricultural heritage and continue to provide environmental benefits. 2. European Policies and Guidelines Gravity-fed surface irrigation systems remain the most common type of infrastructure for crop and pasture irrigation worldwide due to their low cost and low energy requirements [1]. However, these systems often use very high amounts of water to satisfy the irrigation requirements of the crops and are thought to be inherently inefficient [28]. Thus, in response to increasing conflicts among different water users and the need to safeguard the availability of water resources, many important policies have been introduced to reduce water wastage in agriculture settings and to promote the transformation of traditional irrigation systems into pressurized ones, which are often based on drip irrigation [29]. In Spain, with the modernization of the irrigation systems over the period of 2005–2015, the area under pressurized irrigation has increased by approximately 563,000 ha (87% with drip irrigation), while surface irrigation has been reduced to approximately 215,000 ha [30]. From 1990 to 2007, these policies have helped achieve an estimated increase of 15% in irrigation water use efficiency, but this came with an increase in the energy consumption per hectare of irrigated land by a factor of 8 and of the energy consumption per cubic meter of water by a factor of 10 [31]. This, in combination with the noticeable increase in the electricity price in recent years, has produced a certain alarm. In this context, some new pressurized irrigation facilities built with modern technology are not functioning due to high energy costs that render them non-profitable. Alarcon et al. [32] warns that some actions aimed at increasing irrigation efficiency may incur meager savings of water at a high cost and that many environmental impacts on the landscape are often underestimated. The management of water resources is a particularly challenging and difficult task, in which complexities inherent to the hydrological cycle and biological systems are combined with the multiple perspectives, needs, values and concerns associated with the use of water for human activities [33]. Accordingly, the need for a more sustainable and integrated approach to manage water resources in Europe is reflected not only in water-related legislation but also in social policies [34,35]. The Water Framework Directive (WFD) and more recent policies that are closely related to the EU 2020 strategies highlight the fact that improving water resource management for irrigation is one of the primary regional challenges, with strong socio-economic implications [36]. Indeed, Europe recognizes that there is an urgent need to enhance the knowledge of irrigation consumption and to develop systems for increasing the delivery efficiency and regulating water flow at the field and irrigation canal scales, respectively (DM 15/07/2015 No. 213, 2015). EU policy frameworks place great expectations on new technologies to improve water efficiency [37]. The European Commission emphasizes that technological innovation in the field of irrigation will be an increasingly important factor contributing to the competitiveness of small and medium enterprises that operate in this sector [38]. According to the European Parliament, solutions should be found in “clean technologies” that facilitate the efficient use of water without requiring non-renewable energies [39]. As reported in [40], water-efficient irrigation, irrigation on demand, and irrigation using brackish water are technologies that will enable the better management of scarce freshwater resources [41]. Technological developments for irrigation processes will encompass sensors and communication devices, intelligent watering systems and high-efficiency delivery mechanisms for water and nutrients as well as a method for incorporating all of these elements into irrigation “packages” [36]. Similarly, irrigation water efficiency can be enhanced by improvements in the use of current installations and/or by adopting new equipment that is economically supported by funds from the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development [42]. These funds are specifically intended to be used for the development of more efficient irrigation systems at the farm and irrigation district scales using new technologies (e.g., soil moisture and canopy sensors) that better match irrigation with crop water requirements. These developments towards increased sustainability in agriculture also encourage good agricultural practices, such as conservation tillage, restoration of groundwater and the correct management of fertilizers [43]. As highlighted in the [44] report, the improvement of water-use efficiency and productivity depends on the introduction of better agricultural practices in synergy with new irrigation management systems. In fact, the efficiency of an irrigation system is determined more by system management than by any inherent characteristic of the system [45]. Improperly managed “hi-tech” irrigation systems can also be wasteful and unproductive, and they can cause damage to the ecosystem as well as investment losses to farmers. 3. Case Studies Many Southern European countries have vast experience in the use of scarce and degraded natural resources, such as water and land. The rural mosaic of these areas is based on a combination of traditional irrigation systems and areas with extensive agrarian dynamism characterized by modern irrigation projects that have been promoted in accordance with criteria for water efficiency and food security [46]. Countries such as Spain, Portugal and Italy largely symbolize the dominance of water resources in any economic activity in these territories [47]. In such contexts, hydraulic constructions have played a central role in the attempt to control water in the agrarian plains, leading to the development of remarkable irrigation systems [48]. Consequently, the construction of irrigation canals has played a fundamental role in the management of natural and productive resources, land reclamation and ecosystem conservation [49]. In the following sections, we briefly discuss the characteristics and peculiarities of four rural irrigation consortia in Mediterranean Europe (Figure 1), with the aim of analyzing the prospects and difficulties of improving gravity-fed surface irrigation systems in these contexts. Figure 1. The location of the four irrigation districts. 3.1. The Est Ticino-Villoresi District The Est Ticino-Villoresi district is located in the heart of the Padana plain and is the second largest irrigation district in Italy, supplying irrigation water to approximately 115,000 ha. The entire study area is characterized by a high number of small land-holdings with intensive, livestock-oriented practices. The main crops are maize and rice (in descending order). Maize is generally intended as food for livestock, while rice is generally sold at market. The pedo-climatic conditions are favorable for extensive cropping, but farming is strongly dependent on irrigation due to the high water requirements of these crops. By studying twelve years of meteorological data (from 1993 to 2013) from 10 agro-meteorological stations located in the district, Cesari de Maria et al. [2] found that during the agricultural season (April to September), the average temperature was approximately 20.2 °C, while the total rainfall was approximately 360 mm, with marked variability from year to year. The relative humidity was always high (>80%) and implies the presence of foggy months during the winter and hot and muggy months in the summer. During the irrigation period (June to September), the average daily reference evapotranspiration values (calculated based on the FAO Penman–Monteith equation by [50]) for the months of June, July, August and September were 4.7, 4.6, 4.0 and 2.8 mm·day−1, respectively. The traditional irrigation techniques for the two crops consist of furrow irrigation for maize and flood irrigation for rice, with water depths from 5 to 20 cm from just prior to seeding (generally occurring in May) to approximately 3 weeks before harvesting (generally occurring in September) for rice. Approximately 400 m3·s−1 water is conveyed by gravity to all district areas by five main artificial canals that divert water from the Ticino and Adda rivers (the main two tributaries of the Po river). The Naviglio Grande, located in the western part of the district, is the oldest canal, dating back to the XIII century. It conveys a flow of approximately 64 m3·s−1 from the Sommo Lombardo (a city close to the outlet of Lake Maggiore) to Milan, where its residual flow gives rise to the Naviglio Bereguardo (with an average flow of 5 m3·s−1) and the Naviglio Pavese (with an average flow of 10 m3·s−1). The latter was finished at the beginning of the XIX century to provide a navigable link from Milan to Pavia and then from the Po river to the Ticino river. It is also the main canal for supplying irrigation to the fertile lands south of Milan. The Naviglio Martesana, located in the eastern part of the Est-Ticino Villoresi district, was completed at the end of the XV century. In this district, it is the only canal originating from the Adda river, from which it diverts an average rate of 25 m3·s−1. Finally, the Villoresi Canal is the most recent. It was built at the end of the XIX century to supply irrigation water to the lands of the North part of Milan, diverting an average of 50 m3·s−1 from the Ticino river (Figure 2). Figure 2. Location of the Est Ticino-Villoresi district inside the Lombardy Region (a); and the GIS representation of a part of the dense gravity-fed surface irrigation network, which originates from the Villoresi Canal (b). From these main five canals, the water is conveyed to the individual fields through a dense network of unlined open canals that have a combined total length of more than 5000 km. The management of the main canals and of most of the irrigation network is entrusted to the Est Ticino Villoresi Consortium, which was established at the end of the XX century and represents the last heir of a long chain of historical Consortia. Along the canals (from main canals to tertiary ditches), the flow regulation is entrusted by Consortium workers who manually open and close weirs and gates to supply the correct amount of water to all areas of the irrigation district. The water supplied to the farms typically has a weekly rotation. The water delivery efficiency of the irrigation network (from the diversion point to the farm) is quite low, with an amount of seepage along the canals ranging from 5% to 40%. However, these seepages are essential for groundwater recharge and for maintaining the natural equilibrium of the hydrological cycle. From a hydrological perspective, the district is characterized by a strong interaction between groundwater and surface water. The water table of the unconfined aquifer ranges from a few meters to 30–50 m from the ground level, with a strong variability from zone to zone. In the district, more than 200 springs are in operation and supply water for irrigation to most of the rural areas. In many cases, groundwater directly supplies water for the irrigation of downstream fields and preserves the Minimum Flow Level in the rivers. The irrigation network is strongly integrated into the urban fabric of the Milan metropolis, thus playing a scenic role in addition to its hydraulic function. It also represents an important historical heritage and is widely used for recreational purposes. For example, the Canale Villoresi represents a blue-green corridor between the Ticino and Adda rivers and has been enhanced through a series of projects aimed to increase cycle-tourism and light-draft boat navigability. The lack of flow measures in the network canals makes it difficult to assess water balances on different spatial scales and control water use efficiency. Only the main canals and some secondary ditches are monitored daily by Consortium workers, who read the water level gauge inside the hydraulic structures. Modern flow meter devices have been installed only at a few points, and in these points the measure of the flow is continuous. 3.2. The Baix Ter Irrigation District The Baix Ter irrigation district is located in the north-eastern region of Catalonia (Spain) and is part of the internal basins of Catalonia region (Figure 3). The water administration (planning, management and control) of this area falls under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Autonomous Community of Catalonia through the Catalan Water Agency. Figure 3. Location of the Baix Ter irrigation district and the Irrigation Communities (Catalonia, Spain). Crop distribution is also shown. The Baix Ter is an alluvial plain that represents the main agricultural area of the internal basins of the Catalonia region. The total water demand for different uses in this area is approximately 100 hm3 per year, of which 70% is used to meet the water requirements of major crops, mainly summer cereals (maize and rice), fresh fruit (apple trees), fodder (lucerne and ryegrass), poplars and nurseries of ornamental ligneous plants (Figure 3). The irrigation water comes mainly from surface water catchments through dams constructed along the river and to a lesser extent from wells (approximately 800), which use water from the low Ter aquifer. Several circumstances related to the management of water resources in the Baix Ter area must be considered. The first is competition for water use. The area has a Mediterranean climate, characterized by important variations in water availability. The water is needed not only for agriculture; a huge amount is also transferred from the Ter River towards the Barcelona metropolitan area (8 m3·s−1) for urban and industrial uses, which currently use 70% of the flow rate of the Ter River and take priority when there are water restrictions. The recreational uses of this water are also very important since the Baix Ter area is included in the Costa Brava, which is important for tourism and is therefore of significant economic interest (approximately one third of the economic value generated by tourism for all of Catalonia). This is especially true during the summer period, when the agricultural water demand is the highest. A second consideration is that this area is located over the Baix Ter aquifer, with an extension of 165 km2 and is at risk of contravening the limits set by the EU Water Framework Directive due to its high concentrations of chlorides, nitrates and sulfates at specific locations. There are also reductions in the groundwater levels in different locations and a risk of seawater intrusion into the coastal areas. A third consideration is the high environmental and landscape importance both for the tourism interest in the area as well as from inclusion in the Montgrí, Illes Medes and Baix Ter Natural Park, which is considered an area of special environmental protection by the Autonomous Government of Catalonia. The multifunctional role of the irrigation canals of the Baix Ter district has been highlighted by [51,52]. The irrigators of the Baix Ter area are organized into four Irrigation Communities (Sèquia Vinyals; Sèquia Cervià de Ter, Sant Jordi Desvalls i Colomers; Presa de Colomers Marge Esquerre del Riu Ter; Reg del Molí de Pals) and grouped into the Catalan Association of Irrigation Communities. The Irrigation Communities are public law corporations attached to the basin organizations. The irrigation district of the Baix Ter occupies approximately 10,000 ha and consists of approximately 2800 tax irrigators, of which approximately one quarter are professional farmers. The water uptake from the Ter River is conveyed to a system of canals and gravity ducts, which distribute water to the plots. The total length of the primary canals is approximately 120 km. In some communities, the water concession ranges from 0.8 to 5 m3·s−1 throughout the year, while in other communities it varies depending on the month. The channels date from several centuries ago and were originally earthen constructions with irregular sections or with dry stone masonry. In recent years, the Department of Agriculture of the Catalonian Government has planned and executed important improvement works in the irrigation network, which are basically the concrete lining of the channels or the piping canals. These are only partial actions aiming to reduce water loss along the distribution network. The investments have been partially subsidized due to their high costs. The irrigation system in the Baix Ter district is mostly located along the surface, despite governmental economic policies promoting the transformation to pressurized irrigation, especially drip irrigation (DOGC, Num. 6947, 1 September 2015, Ordre ARP (270/2015)). The behavior of the farmers and Irrigation Communities can be primarily explained because surface irrigation is supposed to be a low cost to the farmer in terms of installation, with zero energy requirements. In the future, the coexistence of surface and pressurized irrigation systems in this area is predicted. The type of water tariff paid by the farmers is for the irrigable surface area and is slightly variable according to the irrigation district, ranging from 120 to 160 €·ha−1·year−1 (excluding the fee for improvement works). Assuming an irrigation amount of 7000 m3·ha−1, the price is equivalent to 0.017–0.023 €·m−3. In the irrigation districts with earthen canals, 60% of the fee goes towards clearing vegetation from the channels and cleaning the beds. Usually, the water is distributed on demand, although in shortage periods it is distributed on rotation. All the moving elements of the channels are governed manually. In the context of the geographical area (with a high competency for the inter-sectoral water use, and some periods of insufficient supply), the main concern of the irrigators is to have a guaranteed water supply. The request of the irrigators and broad social sectors at the Water Administration has resulted in a greater flow rate of the Ter River, reducing the water transfer to Barcelona metropolitan area. The implantation of markets for irrigation water in this irrigation area would guarantee the optimal reassignment of the resource during low-water periods to prevent conflicts; however, the irrigators would not accept this new tool and its associated transaction costs [53]. The Irrigation Communities are facing several problems. (i) There is a lack of knowledge regarding the irrigation water needs and discharge rates required by different crops due to the lack of technology and appropriate metering systems. This fact does not encourage irrigators to make the best use of their allocated water; (ii) The hydraulic infrastructure is based on existing manual controls and is managed only by pre-established schedules that do not allow for adjustment of the water plot deliveries to the changing irrigation requirements. Therefore, it would be necessary to have real-time and continuous control of the water levels in the canals in order to obtain optimal deliveries improving, thus, distribution and application efficiencies up to the field scale; (iii) It is challenging to operate a hydraulic control system based on a manual system that also produces losses of water and overflows within the hydraulic network; (iv) It is difficult to manage the irrigation plots. The lack of technical criteria to define input flow rates and cutting times on the plot scale affects not only the achieved efficiency in the field but also the optimal alterations to the main and secondary channels. An example of the potential that can be achieved under surface irrigation can be illustrated by the irrigation distribution uniformity of the low quarter and efficiency application achieving of 88 and 93%, respectively, as reported by Arbat et al. [54] in a commercial furrow irrigated ornamental orchard in the Sèquia Vinyals; (v) The price the irrigators pay for the water is not consistent with the pricing policy set forth in the EU Water Framework Directive. The progressive adaptation of pricing is expected to happen and will be important for consideration. Consequently, improving the efficiency of the surface irrigation in the Baix Ter irrigation district should be approached with the dual aims of improving the irrigation channel control and improving the irrigation at the field scale. The required technology is based on the control and automation from the plot supply to the main and secondary channels, thus solving several problems that the Irrigation Communities of the Baix Ter area are currently facing, giving them the right tools and considering economic criteria to achieve a good return on their investment. The surface irrigation system is deeply rooted in the culture and customs of the irrigator of the Baix Ter region. It is the most sustainable irrigation system, given both its lack of an operational energy consumption and its effects on life-cycle assessment of materials and carbon footprint. Furthermore, this system is fully integrated into the landscape in an attractive way. These values are particularly interesting in an area such as the Baix Ter, which is a strategic area in terms of the tourism and recreation economies. 3.3. Urgell District The Segre River originates in the Pyrenees mountain range and passes through the central valley of Catalonia (NE Spain), ultimately flowing into the Ebro river. The irrigation district of the Urgell canal is located in this depression (Figure 4). The irrigation area is served by two main canals and four secondary canals, which supply a total area of 70,000 ha. The main water use is agriculture, but this waterway also provides urban, livestock, industrial and environmental supplies. Alfalfa, cereals, and fruits are grown. Surface irrigation is mainly used (92%), but drip and sprinkler irrigation is also used to a lesser extent. Figure 4. General view of the main and secondary canals of the Urgell Canal district. The main canal was built in 1861, but most of the irrigation network has been modified. Most main canals (191 km), secondary canals (102 km) and tertiary canals have all been lined, although a few stretches remain unlined given their historical and scenic interest. Recent studies [55] have shown that the conveyance efficiency of the main canals considering evaporation and seepage losses is 94%. When considering operation losses, this efficiency decreases to 86%, indicating that operations could be improved. The water users association is currently increasing the canal height, which would allow for a higher water capacity as well as automation. The network has several remotely controlled gates. The irrigation network is organized in rotation, with the ability to distinguish two types of zones: one in which regulating reservoirs have been built, without the need to irrigate at night, and another that represents 40% of the irrigation area, which must be irrigated at night. The latter system translates into an inconvenience for farmers and a decrease in water efficiency. A possible improvement in this area would be to automate irrigation. Irrigation assessments have been completed [56]. These suggest that efficiency is closely related to the soil characteristics. In soils developed on thin detrital materials, irrigation efficiencies typically range between 65% and 85%, while in soils developed on gravels with high infiltration rates, the efficiencies are between 20% and 40%. Before 2000, Segre river regulation was quite low to assure an adequate supply to the irrigation area, resulting in many years of shortage. For this reason, small weirs were built in drainage ditches in the lower irrigation area to derive this excess water from the highlands. This factor increases the overall efficiency. Inside the irrigation area, there is an endorheic basin. This basin contains a swamp that has grown after the construction of the canal due to surplus irrigation water, becoming a 200 ha swamp with abundant wildlife and fishing. In 1951, they drained the swamp to allocate more land for agriculture. However, in 2005, it was decided to recover it to restore its ecological and landscape functions and make it a tourist resource for the area. Presently, the canal provides the same amount of water as agricultural land. 3.4. Lis Valley District The Lis Valley district, from the Lis Valley Irrigation Project, is a small yet important agricultural area of the Center of Portugal, with a total area of 2000 ha managed by the Lis Water Users Association (Figure 5). Its irrigation and drainage system dates back to 1957. An annual average of approximately 7.1 million m3 of water is used to grow corn grain, rice, and horticultural crops as well as for orchards, meadows and forage. Figure 5. Location of the Lis Valley Irrigation Project (Portugal). The water supply to the open channels conveyance network relies on weirs installed along the Lis River and tributaries. In the dry season, it also uses water pumped from drainage ditches. The irrigation network comprises 17 weirs, two of which are modern and automatic structures. The length of the primary irrigation network is 44.5 km; the secondary irrigation network consists of 180 km of small lined or earthen channels. In terms of water distribution, the most important problems are the water shortage and poor water quality in the summer (dry) period, and the absence of automation mechanisms to control water levels in the network channels, leading to malfunctions. Furthermore, there is not a monitoring system in the distribution network to support its efficient operation. At the on-farm level, there is a need to further develop the irrigation systems by improving the land levelling and the use of water distribution equipment to accurately control the inflow rates. Presently, the national government is planning for the rehabilitation of a significant part of the water distribution network that will reduce the water losses in the channels and simplify their management. It will also allow for increases in the cultivation of more profitable crops, namely, nurseries and horticultural crops. However, the study of different options for the automation of this network is of particular relevance to achieve optimized solutions of water distribution that better integrate farm irrigation. Challenges in developing surface irrigation at the levels of off-farm (responsibility of the water users associations) and on-farm (responsibility of the individual farmers) distribution networks include improving several factors: (i) the quality of hydraulic infrastructures to reduce water losses and control flow more accurately by installing automatic control equipment in the networks; (ii) the management of collective networks through the implementation of operational plans to adjust the demand for water in each irrigation season with the corresponding distribution, which requires the integration of diverse information in real time; (iii) system design quality related to the maintenance of the land leveling at the field plot scale; (iv) irrigation control and allocation through monitoring of soil saturation and vegetation in addition to the adjustment of application times, feed rates, and required allocations; (v) water application control using automated systems to optimize application efficiency and reduce hand labour consumption; and (vi) the re-use of excess flow at the downstream end of irrigated fields. 4. General Issues That Emerge from the Case Studies Analysis of the case studies has identified several water resource management issues that need to be taken into account for the improved implementation of gravity-fed surface irrigation practices and techniques in the future. (i) The high level of competition for water among agricultural, civil and industrial users, especially where rural areas are included in or strongly connected to the urban fabric is one such issue; as is (ii) the importance of environmental and recreational uses of water. For example, some agricultural areas—such as Baix Ter, which is included in the Costa Brava area—are included in regions with a high level of tourism and economic interest, especially during the summer when the water demand for agriculture is at its highest); (iii) The role of aquifer recharge due to irrigation in preventing the risks of seawater intrusion in coastal aquifers should also be considered; as well as (iv) the low efficiency in water conveyance and distribution due to the often precarious control of the infrastructure and a lack of flow regulation flexibility; (v) Irrigation scheduling decision support services that provide the farmer with information about “when” and “how much” irrigation are also lacking. In particular, specific problems that occur in study areas are (i) the lack of knowledge of crop water requirements as well as the delivered water volumes at the single farm or irrigation district scales (due in many cases to the absence of appropriate metering systems); (ii) the limitations of the existing hydraulic infrastructure based on manual controls and managed according to pre-established seasonal schedules that do not allow for shorter-term adjustments to the changing irrigation requirements; and (iii) the unmeasured seepage losses from the canal network. Reasons for These Limitations The lack of technically sound criteria to define the correct flow rate and cutting time of the gates strongly affects the water use efficiency at the field scale and the water delivery efficiency at the canal scale. Rijo and Almeida [57] showed that conveyance efficiencies for automatic systems of flow regulation, developed in the context of the Sorraia Irrigation project (Portugal), were more than 80% during the irrigation period. In contrast, Koech et al. [58] reported that the application of automatic gate irrigation systems in furrow-irrigated cotton fields in Australia has led to an application efficiency of up to 90%. It follows that the problem of increasing the efficiency of gravity-fed surface irrigation systems should be approached with two synergic objectives: improving the control of flow in the irrigation canals (district scale) and improving the water application at the field scale (farm scale). Although researchers have developed new devices and practical scheduling procedures to improve gravity-fed surface irrigation systems over the last decade [59,60], the adoption of these devices and procedures has been limited for many reasons. At the farm scale, the issue most frequently mentioned by growers is the lack of financial benefits for changing their current practices, which they consider to be adequate. In many cases, the initial investment to modernize the traditional pattern of gravity-fed surface irrigation systems with automatic and remote-controlled devices is about the same investment necessary to adopt a pressurized system for irrigation. Moreover, in contexts such as Northern Italy, where extensive cultivation is mainly intended for livestock food and connected to the milk production economy, this conversion is not profitable. Therefore, future gravity-fed surface irrigation technologies should merge net farmer incomes with water efficiency and productivity so that the farmers will be persuaded to adopt these new technologies for their own economic interests while increasing irrigation efficiency. Using a financial approach to incentivize increases in water efficiency rather than an engineering one appears to be prudent when assessing irrigation performance at the farm level because any managerial (e.g., scheduling) and operational (e.g., equipment) inefficiencies associated with irrigation are implicitly included in the assessment of profits [60]. In fact, given that the current gravity-fed surface irrigation systems are mainly manually managed, such inefficiencies lead to an amplification of the time and labor costs required for irrigation, which must be subtracted from the yielded profits. Another factor strongly limiting the modernization of the gravity-fed surface irrigation systems is the perception that farmers have about the efficient use of water for irrigation. In Knox et al. [60], the questionnaire answered by growers belonging to eight samples of farmers in eastern England showed that most of the growers surveyed (63%) considered “irrigation efficiency” to be best defined as “applying the right amount of water at the right time in the right place”. A quarter of the respondents interpreted irrigation efficiency as “maximizing the value of the water applied (Money/Volume)” and 13% as “improving production per unit of water applied (Yield weight/Volume)”. The definitions relating to irrigation water use efficiency, including “improving the yield from the same amount of water” and “maximizing the proportion of water used by the plant”, were not selected by any farmers. In Mediterranean contexts, this problem is exacerbated by the lack of farmer knowledge about crop water requirements and the insufficient presence of organizations (either governmental or commercial) to provide irrigation scheduling advice for farmers that adopt gravity-fed irrigation methods. Although some research on the development of irrigation decision support systems has been funded by EU in the last 10 years [61], it has not always succeeded in converting research outputs into marketable products and commercial success stories. Research activities are often more research-driven than farmer-driven, and only two projects of the 10 quoted in the work of Giannakis et al. [59] had developed a business plan to commercialize their research innovation. Lastly, the human capital characteristics of the farm populations play a prominent role in the adoption of new irrigation management tools and technologies for gravity-fed irrigation systems. Lichtenberg et al. [62] found that farmers with a higher level of education are more likely to adopt sensor network irrigation technologies. In particular, farmers with a high school education are 23% less likely to adopt the new irrigation technology compared to those with a post-secondary degree. Genius et al. [63] recorded similar findings, i.e., farmers with a higher educational level (more than 9 years) are more likely to adopt new irrigation technology. Genius et al. [63] found also that farmers up to 60 years old are more likely to adopt new technology than farmers older than 60 years, highlighting the short planning horizon of the older farmers. However, in the Mediterranean European countries, approximately 57% of farmers are older than 55 years old; in Portugal, Italy and Spain, these percentages are 71%, 61% and 55%, respectively [59]. In this context, farmers exhibit substantial risk aversion and are skeptical of adopting new technologies. This uncertainty can be alleviated through on-farm testing and demonstrations, farmer-to-farmer communication and the active involvement of farmer advisory systems [61]. At the district scale, the irrigation water delivery by gravity-fed surface irrigation systems is not usually measured or is often not measured accurately, particularly at the secondary and tertiary levels. In addition, the flow rates at the intake of the delivery canals are not routinely recorded. The reasons for these failings are mainly due to the complexity that the gravity-fed surface irrigation system networks have developed over the centuries. Many canals have a mixed use and are important for both the delivery and drainage of water from the fields. In several cases, this network is convoluted and abstruse. The lack of water measurements and poor quality of district records discourage the irrigation Consortium and Association from the implementation of new irrigation technologies that aim to improve water conveyance efficiency and resource allocation [64]. Moreover, the lack of methodologies for assessing the water delivery performance of the open irrigation canals makes the quantification of the gap between the potential and actual performance of these irrigation systems challenging [65]. 5. What Can We Do? 5.1. Technical Advice To address the problems described above, we believe that a practicable requalification of gravity-fed surface irrigation systems in the context of rural Mediterranean Europe could be achieved through strategies that evolve from trinomial Measure-Model-Management (M3). In the following, we try to explain this concept in light of the literature results obtained in different world contexts. Measuring facilitates the analysis of gravity-fed irrigation delivery systems in terms of adequacy, efficiency, dependability, and equity of water delivery [66]. The measures could provide a quantitative assessment not only of the overall irrigation system performance but also of the contributions to the total performance from the structural and management components of the system. For example, in the works of [67,68,69], the adequacy, efficiency, dependability, and equity indexes of open canals in Mali, Turkey and Egypt ranged from 0.20 to 0.90, demonstrating the high possibility of improving the performances of the delivery systems adopting automated and remote-controlled operational procedures. Despite this, many studies on the possibility of assessing the water delivery performance of gravity-fed irrigation systems are present in the literature in the rural contexts of the United States of America, Africa and Southeast Asia [64,70], whereas no research has currently been completed by authors in Mediterranean European contexts. This is due to the lack of flow measures and the necessity of building hydraulic structures for reliably measurements. However, modern technologies that are based on optical sensors and on open-hardware devices could be suitable for the continuous and real-time control of flows in complex situations or open-unlined irrigation canals [71,72,73]. The work of Luthi et al. [74] on a smartphone application that calculates the flow by analyzing a few seconds of a movie sequence that is recorded by the operator on-site is a good example of such research. The flow is calculated based on measurements of the water level, the surface velocity obtained from Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) technique and a priori knowledge on the canal geometry. In Mediterranean Europe, this application could have several advantages, such as reducing the work time of Consortium workers to take measurements and improving the ease of data collection, which could simply be sent via SMS to a dedicated database. Models can be subdivided into three main categories. The first category focuses on the hydraulic analysis of irrigation canal flow networks, while the second aims to assess crop water requirements at farm and district scales. The third category uses decision support systems for scheduling irrigation. The first two typologies of the models could be considered for the reasonable operation and planning with optimized irrigation and water allocation. For example, the study by Kim et al. [75] carried out in a paddy district of South Korea showed the good performance (in terms of calibration and validation) of the combined hydraulic-hydrologic Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) for providing hydraulic analysis of the irrigation network and water balance in the fields. In Mediterranean European contexts, this model could assist in promoting accurate irrigation scheduling on the district scale based on crop water requirements as well as optimizing the distribution of water in the irrigation network through sluice gate control. In addition, conjunctive modelling based on hydrological-economic features could investigate the interdependencies between gravity-fed surface irrigation systems, the district water balance and the economic impact of new irrigation decision strategies [5]. Simulations and scenarios of the optimized irrigation scheduling and water allocations could be produced, thus improving the irrigation planning processes from the farm to the district scale [76]. We believe that for a fast feedback effect on Mediterranean European rural territories of the M3 approach, the gravity-fed surface irrigation systems should be equipped with automatic and remote-controlled gates whenever possible as well as flow meters for the continuous measurement of the irrigation flow both in the canals and into the fields. At the farm scale, Australian experiences in the cotton fields have shown that the application of these automatic systems leads to the maximization of the application and distribution uniformity efficiencies (>85%), ensuring that the water reaches the end of the field with a uniform level in all points of the field [58]. Currently, only two experiments are running in Spain and Italy for providing the crop water requirements using automatic and remote controlled prototypes of bay-gates. In Spain, automatic furrow irrigation is tested on maize and grass using soil humidity probes at different depths in the field as the control of crop water needs (Figure 6a), while in Italy, automatic sluices governed by water level sensors in the field maintain the correct flood state of flood in the paddy field, as shown in Figure 6b [77]. Figure 6. Prototypes of automatic and remote controlled-gates for gravity-fed surface irrigation of grass field in Northern Spain (a) and rice field in Northern Italy (b). At the district scale, the overview provided by Oakes et al. [78] on the collective experience gained over the last 20 years in the development and application of automation technology to the open channel irrigation sector, primarily in Australia but more recently in the USA, China, New Zealand, India, Vietnam, France and Italy, highlighted that the automation and remote control of gravity irrigation systems will be useful for improving the productivity of irrigated agriculture to reach food production goals over the next several years. However, they suggest that the key success factor for the modernization of the gravity-fed irrigation systems is a smooth transition to an automated irrigation system, implementing sound education/information/training programs for both the consortium staff and customers in the use and maintenance of these systems. 5.2. Economic Advice The European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development supports investments in irrigation scheduling infrastructure to provide economic and environmental benefits. Several measures can be used for the protection and maintenance of water resources in agriculture, namely, measure 6.1.01 (for the realization and modernization of agricultural holdings), measure 7.6.01 (for infrastructure related to the development and adaptation of agriculture and forestry), measure 1.2.01 (for the vocational training and information actions), measures 10 and 16 (for agri-environment payments and cooperation), and measure 4.4.02 (for non-productive investments for irrigation management). In total, approximately 50% of the budgets of Rural Development Programmes in EU member states has been allocated to measures that relate to a certain or limited extent to water for the 2014–2020 period. 5.3. Reviving Interest in Gravity-Fed Surface Irrigation Systems Finding solutions that safeguard the gravity-fed surface irrigation systems is necessary to maintain the environmental and ecological equilibrium of rural areas in Southern Europe and to preserve the cultural heritage of these irrigation systems. The multi-functional characteristics of the gravity-fed surface irrigation systems (Figure 7) could be safeguarded by the conservation and revitalization of these systems driven by historic, ethnological, educational, ecological and environmental interests [79,80]. Two major directions could serve as the foundation for future revival initiatives. On the one hand, the focus could be on the preservation of gravity-fed surface irrigation systems themselves as an agro-cultural heritage [81,82]. On the other hand, the focus could be on the nature conservation benefits that result from these systems [83,84]. Figure 7. Example of the multi-functionality character of the gravity-fed surface irrigation system in Northern Italy rural contexts. In the first case, the traditional structure and networks of gravity-fed surface irrigation systems could be considered as an “eco-museum”, in which their complexity and ancient origin could be investigated through historical and landscape studies and possibly explained in situ during educational visits. In fact, the risk of a potential demise of traditional gravity-fed surface irrigation systems is equivalent to the loss of traditional knowledge. Gravity-fed surface irrigation is a typical skill-oriented technology [85]. Currently, gravity-fed surface irrigation practitioners are able to combine their rich hands-on experience with the local traditional knowledge. Their skills may be implemented into the new automatic gravity-fed surface irrigation systems with specific irrigation scheduling management tools according to the crop requirements and agronomic practices. In the second case, the nature conservation benefits of the gravity-fed surface irrigation systems have been widely demonstrated in the case study areas, where the centuries-long development of this type of irrigation system has contributed to the development of their characteristic agro-natural environment [86,87]. For example, the prolonged presence and circulation of water due to the surface irrigation of paddy fields from sowing to harvest represents a distinguishing feature of some of these irrigated areas (e.g., in parts of the Northern Italy plains and in the Baix Ter irrigation districts) that has been included in the European ecological network NATURA 2000 and is on the official list of the European Special Protected Areas. In addition to heritage preservation and nature conservation, additional environmental factors have emerged as driving forces for the preservation and restoration of gravity-fed surface irrigation systems, although the integrated landscape-ecological consequences of these systems require further research [88,89]. As highlighted in the previous paragraphs, gravity-fed surface irrigation schemes are thought to be generally of low water use efficiency or even to be “wasteful”. To establish whether an irrigation technique is efficient for a specific territory, it is necessary to quantify the water availability and the irrigation water demand for that area and then to evaluate the efficiency of the irrigation systems. However, the irrigation efficiency should be evaluated using a larger-scale approach (from the irrigation district to the basin), considering not only the hydraulic efficiency but also the secondary benefits [90]. Such secondary benefits range from recreational features, including the picturesque rural roads bordering the canals, to ecological functions, including the preservation of the traditional fauna and flora of the rural landscape. These factors improve the multi-functional character of the gravity-fed surface irrigation systems. In a case study in northern Portugal, Van den Dries and Portela [86] demonstrated how the conversion of a gravity-fed surface irrigation system into a pressurized system has paradoxically provoked a reduction in the deliveries at the farm level. In gravity-fed surface irrigation systems, the water excess on the fields was returned to the natural downstream waterway, thus representing the new (and in many cases, the majority) input for the irrigation of the downstream farms. These ‘losses’, which are generally due to drainage or percolations, are important for regional aquifer recharge and for maintaining the minimum flow and level in the rivers [91]. In addition, the water ‘losses’ along the unlined water conveyance and distribution systems represent a possibility for aquifer recharge management [92]. Interestingly, a recent study by Seraphin et al. [93] found that using isotopes for tracing the contributions to the groundwater recharge of the Cru aquifer in France, showing that about 69% ± 9% of the surface recharge is caused by irrigation return flow i.e., from specific irrigation practices and the presence of unlined canals. Moreover, many assumptions suggest that the quality of water that flow in the gravity-fed surface irrigation canals is comparable with that in the feeding rivers. In the light of this consideration, the seepage of water from unlined canals, in contrast to deep percolation at the fields, preserves groundwater from the chemical contamination of agronomic treatments, pursuant to the EU directives for water pollution reductions (i.e., “nitrate directive” 91/676/CEE [94]). Lastly, the perfect integration found between gravity-fed surface irrigation canals and urban fabric in many situations such as in Milan metropolis, confers to these irrigation systems a new important role related to a “hydraulic protection of the territory” [95]. In fact, the huge increase of impervious areas as a consequence of the urban expansion, in the last decades, has caused an unexpected increase in the frequency and intensity of flood events. In these urban contexts, where the areas for flood storage are hard to find, an alternative solution for flood risk mitigation (in addition to the green infrastructure projects) could be the rehabilitation of interconnections between sewer and irrigation canals with spillways designed for allowing rainwater to be stored into the irrigation network. 6. Conclusions In the last decade, concerns about water scarcity have focused on the relationship between irrigation and other competing water uses. Especially in the countries of Southern Europe, where gravity-fed surface irrigation systems are the most common infrastructure type for crop and pasture irrigation, many policy guidelines have started to promote the transformation of these traditional systems into pressurized ones to avoid waste and increase the supply efficiency. However, as highlighted in this work, to face the complexity of irrigation water resource management conflicts and address the challenges in improving irrigation practices, “hard-path” approaches are not enough. In fact, case studies show that gravity-fed surface irrigation systems have important environmental and ecosystem functions in addition to their hydraulic role and are part of the cultural heritage of rural Southern Europe. Some of these benefits are connected with maintaining the riparian vegetation and habitats along the canals, recharging the groundwater supply, and providing areas for recreation activities and tourism. Thus, designing smart “soft-path” measures will be possible to increase the flexibility of the gravity-fed surface irrigation systems in response to the projected climate and changes in water availability. These designs should consider distributed and participatory irrigation managements, on-demand irrigation, low-cost and reversible infrastructural interventions, flow measures and automatic and real-time controls. A new Irrigation-Energy-Environmental-Landscape-Cultural Heritage nexus has been added to the more traditional Energy-Irrigation nexus and Food-Energy-Irrigation nexus [96], demonstrating that if the gravity-fed surface irrigation systems currently present and deeply-rooted in Mediterranean rural contexts are opportunely restored, they are preferred over “modern” systems (such as pressurized pipes) because they provide “efficiencies” in many fields beyond their hydraulic functions. In particular, in contrast to the scarce supply efficiency at the farm scale, the effective efficiency of these irrigation systems at the district or basin scale is emblematic, given their capacity to exchange water with the subsoil, reuse field runoff and feed the rivers. Hence, ecosystem functions and landscape characteristics of the rural environments are ensured, guaranteeing favorable outcomes for all agro-environmental aspects. In our opinion, a smart restoration of the gravity-fed surface irrigation system in Southern Europe areas could be obtained using the M3 approach described in Section 5.1, combining flow measures and soft infrastructural improvements with hydraulic-hydrological and decision-support models as well as matching multidisciplinary competences and water user needs. It has become increasingly clear that the analysis of irrigation system developments is necessary for managing these territories, and this requires considering the availability of natural resources to interpret the changing demands of users and address the existing and potential conflicts that will arise between consumptive and non-consumptive water uses. In conclusion, we wish that with this work, the awareness of the importance and uniqueness of some Southern Europe gravity-fed surface irrigation systems will increase. It is our hope that in the future, agricultural and environmental policies will be further safeguarded, encouraging additional research on their continued enhancement and rehabilitation. Acknowledgments This work arises from the need to protect and preserve the typical gravity-fed surface irrigation systems belonging to the Mediterranean areas of Europe. The authors are working for rehabilitating these irrigation systems with a new sustainable appeal aimed to increase the water management performance at field and district scales. They are actively cooperating with local authorities for the implementation of measures necessary for the protection and requalification of these irrigation systems.

SECTIONS PDF TOOLS SHARE Abstract EN FR Recently, the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) prepared a Manual of Practice (MOP) on canal automation for irrigation systems. Formally referred to as MOP 131 Canal Automation for Irrigation Systems, this book focuses on the technical aspects of modernizing irrigation systems through the use of automated canal control systems. MOP 131 is an essential reference for professionals in agricultural and irrigation engineering, as well as owners, managers, and operators of irrigation water delivery systems. Canal automation saves water and improves the efficiency of irrigation water supply projects or of irrigation district operations. Recent technological and engineering advances now enable more accurate control of water deliveries throughout all parts of an irrigation project. Using information collected from irrigation systems around the world in conjunction with new advances in control theory research, this MOP examines how and when to implement canal automation within the context of canal modernization. In addition, MOP 131 provides practical guidance on other aspects of canal automation, including the modernization process, constraints, and concepts; survey of irrigation physical infrastructure; SCADA systems; control operation concepts; canal hydraulic properties; automatic control methods; verification of controller performance; and implementation of control systems. This paper provides a brief summary of MOP 131 within the context of the history and future of canal automation. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Background Canal automation always has had the potential to save water and improve efficiency of irrigation water supply projects or of irrigation district operations. Recently, there have been a number of technological and engineering advances in the field of canal automation. While these advances have been documented via conference proceedings and peer-reviewed journal articles, a comprehensive document outlining the state of the art in canal automation was lacking. The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) decided to fill this void by commissioning the development of the Manual of Practice (MOP) 131: Canal Automation for Irrigation Systems (Wahlin and Zimbelman, 2014). MOP 131 was developed by the Task Committee on Recent Advances in Canal Automation (TCRACA) which was formed under the Irrigation Delivery and Drainage Systems (IDDS) Committee under the Environmental and Water Resources Institute (EWRI) of ASCE. Note that EWRI is an entity within ASCE that focuses on water resources instead of civil engineering in general. The TCRACA members gathered information on canal automation research and practice from around the world in their efforts to document the application of new technology to the progress of designing and implementing irrigation canal automation. The TCRACA was a truly international effort with researchers and practitioners from the USA, the Netherlands, Australia, France, Spain, Portugal, China, and Mexico all participating in the development of MOP 131. MOP 131 is designed to provide guidance on how and when to implement canal automation within the context of canal modernization but not covering the full range of canal modernization issues. The manual also provides practical guidance on some of the more routine aspects of canal automation. Note that while MOP 131 was developed by the cooperative efforts of eight different countries, it has not been formally adopted by the administrations of those countries. Historical Perspective on Canal Automation In order to plan for a successful canal modernization program, with measurable goals and objectives, that provides water users (irrigators) with improved flexibility, it is not only interesting but also very helpful to review how the science of irrigation canal automation arrived at today's technology. For purposes of this paper, a historic review will principally be from the perspective of the USA. A broader perspective would require more time and space than allowed herein. Then, as now, members of ASCE, working through committees of what was then the Irrigation and Drainage Division, which later merged into EWRI, paved the way for presenting and discussing improved operations of irrigation water supply systems. Their deliberations were published in 1968 as Automation of Irrigation and Drainage Systems which contained papers from a conference held in Phoenix, Arizona, in the United States (ASCE, 1968). A paper by the Salt River Project (SRP), a United States Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) project, discussed efforts to develop a supervisory control system for distribution canal operations that relied on new technology to measure gate openings, compute gate flows, monitor water levels, transmit data to a centralized operations center, and remotely move gates. During the same general time period, the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) was in the process of designing the United States' largest state-built water and power project to move water from northern California to cities and irrigators in water-short southern California. This project became known as the State Water Project (SWP). Power usage and power generation were to be key elements of the SWP along with the multibasin transfer of water. Optimizing power generation and movement of water, while minimizing power usage, required the development of an innovative canal operation strategy. The research developed from this project was presented in several publications from 1964 to 1976 and included topics such as hydraulic transients, check structure hydraulics, and computerized control. The research also resulted in the formulation of a computerized model of the aqueduct that simulated unsteady flow in the SWP. The USBR has the primary responsibility for the design and construction of water resource infrastructure for the purpose of providing irrigation water to irrigable lands in the western United States. As such, the USBR took the early lead in investigating ways of enhancing the operational efficiency of irrigation water supply districts (projects). While weirs, flumes, sluice gates, and radial gates were in common usage, the integration of electromechanical devices to make the task of water masters and ditch riders easier, more precise, and timelier, came about as a result of the USBR directing its researchers and design engineers to take a leadership role in the early development of canal automation equipment and procedures. Subsequently, the USBR published Water System Automation–a State of the Art Report (USBR, 1973). Concepts presented in this reference, for example that optimum operation will result only from proper control of the entire system, are still applicable today. ASCE's Irrigation and Drainage Division moved the technology forward in 1987 by organizing a conference in Portland, Oregon, called Planning, Operation, Rehabilitation and Automation of Irrigation Water Delivery Systems (ASCE, 1987). This included presentations by French engineers discussing their implementation of dynamic regulation in the system of Canal De Provence, NEYRTEC automatic equipment, and BIVAL for downstream control. Dr John Merriam introduced a definition for flexibility as being when the irrigator has control of the frequency, rate, and duration of flow. Only through maximizing flexibility can the irrigator maximize their productivity and economic return. Through the programs and projects of his employer, the World Bank, Herve Plusquellec was able to make presentations to many canal operators and water supply agencies throughout the world using a comprehensive state-of-the-art 35-mm slide presentation (Plusquellec, 1988). Mr Plusquellec was instrumental in bringing the concepts of improved canal operations and modernization to many who had previously not been aware of such concepts and ideas. This was followed by USBR's publication entitled Canal Systems Automation Manual (USBR, 1991). This publication was an update of previous USBR publications with discussions on the practical aspects of canal operation, control, and automation. The manual began with fundamentals and basic concepts, continued with more specific details, and finished with the more complex aspects of control theory analysis. The manual was divided into three parts that address three levels of readership: Volume 1–water users and operators, Volume 2–planning and design engineers, and Volume 3–research and development specialists. Understanding that to move the field of canal automation forward required that researchers and designers be able to model unsteady flow in a canal system, ASCE's Irrigation and Drainage Division undertook the task of providing a definitive treatise on unsteady flow modeling of canals (ASCE, 1993). Later, an EWRI task committee created a comprehensive and detailed review of canal control algorithms (Malaterre et al., 1998). Both of these task committee efforts provided for a meaningful advance in the formulation and verification of canal control theory and practice. Many of the ASCE/EWRI task committee members joined with EWRI in 1999 to organize and conduct a United States Commission on Irrigation and Drainage (USCID) workshop on the Modernization of Irrigation Water Delivery (USCID, 1999), with much of the focus being on current canal automation endeavours. While the above is certainly not an exhaustive presentation of canal automation research and development, it does provide a broad summary and a snapshot of how long water district managers have looked to technology to improve and enhance the delivery of irrigation water to their customers. It also provides a flavor of the approaches, technologies, and agencies that have contributed to the field of automatic canal operations. As pointed out earlier, the goal of MOP 131 is to bring all these past accomplishments together in a single publication that is up to date and useful to system operations personnel, planners, and design engineers. Overview of MOP 131 MOP 131 consists of eight chapters and a glossary. A brief summary of each chapter follows. Chapter 1: Modernization process, constraints, and concepts This first chapter in MOP 131 is probably the most important one. It provides a general overview of the potential benefits of irrigation canal modernization and discusses considerations for assessing whether or not an irrigation or water district should implement automation as it modernizes. If automation appears to be a viable component of modernization, then Chapter 1 describes how to proceed with the process of modernization. This chapter also provides a general overview of the potential benefits of canal automation. This chapter starts out by defining the concept of modernization. Modernization is a combination of technical, managerial, and organizational upgrading (as opposed to mere physical rehabilitation) of irrigation schemes with the objective of improving resource utilization (e.g., water, labor, economics, environment) and water delivery service to farms (Wolter and Burt, 1997). Such modernization investment focuses on the details of the inner workings of an irrigation project. Planners and engineers for irrigation projects frequently equate modernization with practices such as canal lining, piping, and computerized automation; however, such investments are often of low initial priority if one examines the steps needed to improve overall performance. Computerized automation is typically implemented in later stages of modernization, after basic needs such as flow measurement and accounting procedures have already been completed. Modernization is a process that sets specific objectives and selects specific actions and tools to achieve them over an extended period of time. There are no ‘single answers’ as to how and when to implement automation as part of modernization because of the complexity and variety of combinations of the water supplies (surface versus conjunctive use), water allocation policies, water quality, timing of flows, adequacy of the water supplies, topography, aquatic weed problems, soil types as related to seepage and bank stability, usage of return flows, types of existing structures, and so on. There are, however, some basic principles that should be followed to achieve a high level of success in designing, constructing, and implementing a canal automation project. Concepts discussed in this chapter include: Defining potential benefits of modernization and automation; Defining incentives for modernization; Defining realistic/evolving expectations and costs; Assessing the existing system; Defining institutional and operational constraints as related to automation; Selecting the appropriate canal operation strategy; Developing a plan for emergency response/safeguards; Defining where automation fits into a modernization plan; Defining the typical sequence of actions in the modernization process. Chapter 2: Physical infrastructure Chapter 2 provides an overview of the types of structures and devices used for flow or water level control in canal systems. For each structure or device included, there is a photograph along with a discussion on the advantages/disadvantages, the power requirements, and the serviceability of the structure. In addition, the presentation includes a discussion on what measurements need to be made while using the structure. Only structures or devices useful from an automation perspective are discussed. Concepts discussed in this chapter include: Working with an existing irrigation system. Decisions need to be made regarding whether to incorporate existing irrigation system infrastructure or to replace the existing infrastructure with new infrastructure; Conveyance system considerations. The type of canal automation that is physically possible and practical is dependent upon the physical characteristics of the existing canals and water allocation policies; Gates for check structures. A summary of widely available check structure configurations is provided, including programmable logic control (PLC)-based, electrically moved check structures and non-PLC controlled ‘automatic’ check structures; Instrumentation and measurement. A discussion is provided regarding instrument considerations that are common to canal automation including water level, gate position, and flow rate measurements; Pumps. Pumps are an integral part of many automation schemes that must supply or accept water at variable rates that can change from minute to minute without advance notice; Regulating (buffer) reservoirs within the irrigation system. Regulating reservoirs have been used successfully in the western United States to reduce canal spillage, simplify canal operation, and increase the flexibility of the water delivery systems. Chapter 3: SCADA systems Chapter 3 presents considerations regarding the design and implementation of a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system that will support the advanced automation of irrigation canals. This chapter includes discussion of design criteria, applicable technologies, installation, testing, and commissioning of the system. This section of MOP 131 focuses on the SCADA infrastructure itself and not on the control algorithms in the SCADA system processors, which is left for a later chapter. Concepts discussed in this chapter include: Basic introduction to SCADA systems. SCADA refers to a broad and ever-changing spectrum of electronic hardware, computer software, and communications infrastructure that provides a platform for remote monitoring and control in a variety of industrial applications. In canal applications (or irrigation systems), SCADA system complexity ranges from simple systems that allow operators to monitor a few water levels or flow rates over a radio network, to large-scale, multiserver systems capable of automatically controlling large canal networks over fiber-optic and microwave communication networks. Whether small or large, SCADA systems can provide real-time monitoring; remote supervisory or automatic control; alert or emergency notifications; troubleshooting; and automatic data reporting and archiving capabilities; Basic SCADA system components and function. In simple terms, a SCADA system consists of a central base unit, which provides facilities for data storage, manipulation, and visualization. The base unit communicates with one or more remote units (e.g., at a canal check structure) through some communications infrastructure. The remote unit communicates with sensors and implements control instructions issued from the base unit; Control options in SCADA systems. Automatic control options for SCADA systems can be categorized into three basic groups: local control, central control, and distributed control; SCADA project considerations. A discussion is provided detailing considerations for SCADA projects such as system evaluation, building an integration team, system maintenance, and cost. Chapter 4: Control operation and control concepts Chapter 4 presents basic canal control methods and their intended operational goals. A brief discussion of concepts required for implementation is also provided. The limitations of each method are described in terms of the overall control strategy. It is important to note that the concepts discussed in this chapter are not necessarily mutually exclusive, because different concepts can often be used on different parts of the same canal network. Each concept has advantages and drawbacks and each fits better with certain overall strategies. Concepts discussed in this chapter include: Introduction to the control of irrigation canals. In general, control for irrigation canals can be grouped into two categories: supply-oriented and demand-oriented. It is important to note that most canal control strategies include aspects of both supply-oriented and demand-oriented systems; General strategies for control of irrigation canals. A common approach to canal automation is to make gate adjustments at each site successively and then return to each gate to make corrections depending on the observed situation. These initial changes and the later corrections can be interpreted as feedforward and feedback control actions, respectively. The initial changes in settings to provide the new flows downstream are feedforward actions, while the corrections based on the actual situation are feedback actions. Remote control, where observations are communicated to a central control room and, from there, gate adjustments can be remotely implemented, simply allows the users to perform these actions more quickly, more often, with better timing, and with the ability to see more of the canal conditions at once. Automatic controls allow these adjustments to be made automatically. Automation allows control actions to be made more often and, in theory, more precisely. But fundamentally, these different approaches (manual/local, manual/remote, automatic) use the same basic strategies. Chapter 5: Canal hydraulic properties Chapter 5 discusses the hydraulic properties of canal pools and structures, as they relate to needs for canal automation. Since this publication is geared toward modernization of existing canal networks or systems, detailed design considerations are not included. However, changes may be needed to the infrastructure to implement new technologies during modernization, so that the system will allow greater flexibility and thus potentially improve performance. This chapter also presents methods for describing the hydraulic response of canal pools, particularly how water levels respond to changes in flow rate. Concepts discussed in this chapter include: Design issues. Various design issues such as freeboard, canal lining, intermediate structures, and flow capacity are discussed; Canal structure hydraulics. Summary information regarding the hydraulics of typical weirs and gates used in irrigation canals is provided; Canal pool hydraulics. Each pool is unique in its response to changes in flows through control structures. Physical parameters that influence this behavior are longitudinal bed slope, cross section size and shape, length, and bed material. Concepts regarding flow conditions, changes in canal conveyance, pool volumes, and travel time of waves are also discussed; Resonance waves. Resonance waves and their influence on automatic control can be minimized using the filtering procedures discussed; Identification. Methods for determining important hydraulic properties of the canal pool are discussed. These parameters are crucial for controller design. Chapter 6: Control methods Chapter 6 presents control system fundamentals and control techniques that are used to develop controllers for water level or flow rate in irrigation canals. This chapter presents methods by which the control strategies discussed earlier in MOP 131 can be implemented via electronic devices such as PLCs, remote terminal units (RTUs), computers, etc. The intent of canal automation is to improve the operation of the water distribution system, which typically means better service to farmers. Canal automation is intended to improve some aspect of operations by performing controls that would be difficult to do manually and to enhance system monitoring and emergency responses. Concepts discussed in this chapter include: Introduction to control methods. Various control method concepts are defined including control variables and control-action variables; Implementation options. Automatic controls can be organized in a variety of ways: local control, centralized control, hierarchical control, and distributed coordination control; Decoupling pools and structures. To simplify the design of controllers (which are usually linear) and to simplify implementation, most canal controllers determine the flow rate change needed for a check structure and then the gate position change required to achieve the prescribed flow rate in separate computations (algorithms); Routing demand changes through a canal. Routing water through a canal, also called feedforward control, can be done by using the time it takes a flow rate change to travel from the head gate to turnouts (delay times). Various methods for routing water through a canal, an essential control function, are discussed; Feedback control. This section describes the mathematical procedures needed to tune controllers for the control of water levels, flow rates, and/or volumes within a canal. These methods use measurements of water level and/or flow rate to determine what control actions will bring the water level, flow rate, or canal pool volume to a set point value. Details on specific feedback control algorithms such as linear quadratic regulator (LQR), H-infinity, model predictive control (MPC), and proportional integral (PI) flow control are discussed. There is also a discussion on combining feedforward and feedback control. Chapter 7: Verification of controller performance The users of canal automation want to be sure that the automatic control system will function in a way that is useful for their operations. Two essential questions must be answered. First, are the right processes being controlled? Second, is the automatic control functioning in an acceptable manner? This chapter discusses the process that control system designers and integrators should go through so that they can document a successful automation implementation. Concepts discussed in this chapter include: Performance testing issues. This section deals with performance testing of automated canal structure logic; Performance testing with unsteady-flow simulation models. Simulation models are a useful tool for determining the potential performance of canal automation. Many canal automation developers routinely test control algorithm performance for even a single gate with unsteady-flow simulation. This allows the gate to be tested under a variety of flow and operating conditions; Performance measures. This section outlines concrete performance measures that can be used to evaluate how effectively a canal automation scheme is controlling the irrigation delivery system. Performance measures for both water level control and flow rate control are presented. Chapter 8: Implementation of control systems Chapter 8 addresses the practical implementation of canal automation as a project within a wider modernization program. The automation of an entire lateral or whole canal system is described, rather than just a single check structure, because the challenges and benefits are much larger. This chapter describes the sequence of required tasks, including the customization of control software, the installation and commissioning of the field devices and central server software, the progressive activation of control throughout the canal system, the measurement of overall performance of the new system, and the training of operations staff. Ongoing operational tasks and system maintenance are also discussed. Concepts discussed in this chapter include: Project initiation. The first step in any automation project is to determine the project objectives. These might include the improvement of irrigator service levels, water savings, and better control of water levels, operational cost savings, or rate of return on investment. Clear, quantified objectives help ensure success by aligning the irrigation district and implementation team and allowing for objective measurement of performance; Configuration and customization of software. Discussions are provided regarding RTU/PLC software, communications software, SCADA software, water ordering and demand management software, and network representation software; Commissioning. Commissioning is the process by which equipment, a facility, or a plant is tested to verify if it functions according to its design objectives or specifications; Control rollout and tuning. Once the commissioning of the SCADA system is complete, the next step is to roll out or activate the control system. In this section, rollout of control refers to the control on a network scale as it encompasses the processes involved in rolling out control at each location. Sometimes the behavior of the actual system may differ from what has been modeled initially. Hence, fine tuning of controller(s) may be required at intermittent stages; Performance assessment and acceptance. As important as setting the overall project objective is the measurement of the performance of the canal system against those objectives; Postacceptance operation and maintenance. Postacceptance operations and maintenance are an important part of canal automation. It is the analog of a routine maintenance program that irrigation districts generally undertake anyway, but includes new equipment like the software and new operating procedures; Training. An automated canal system requires that operators learn a number of new computer skills and adapt to a new style of operation that involves reacting to operational problems rather than simply implementing routines. This is not dissimilar to the role of a pilot when an airplane is operating in autopilot. The pilot must vigilantly monitor instruments and correct for unforeseen circumstances or deal with alarms; Manuals. In addition to the training, the irrigation district must be supplied with manuals for every component that makes up its system. Conclusions Irrigation district managers as well as state and federal water resource management agencies have for more than 50 years looked to technology to increase their effectiveness, improve their operations, enhance water transmission and delivery, and make their canal systems safer and more responsive. As the technology provided by the development and enhanced performance of computers made quantum leaps in performance, it was logical for the computing power of these devices to be incorporated into the control of irrigation canals. Beyond the power provided by computer technology, was the requirement for an entire array of associate technology that needed to be developed and adapted for canal control. The associated technologies included equipment to measure water levels, flow rates, and gate movements digitally as well as radio and fiber-optic equipment to transmit and receive monitored data. As each of these technologies matured, the engineers and researchers responsible for the research and development of canal control adapted these new technologies into their designs. As such, canal control has matured and become more technically rigorous. In a parallel way, the software needed to control canals also matured through the incorporation of new theories or mathematical models into improved control algorithms. What started out as remote monitoring and control with much of the decision-making left in the hands of humans, has now been refined to the point that automatic control of irrigation canals is a reality. What was lacking was an up-to-date, comprehensive publication that would not only assist irrigation district personnel but also the consulting engineer community with a practical source of knowledge on the worldwide status of automatic canal control. The professionals who were active participants in the development and implementation of automatic canal control joined forces to collaborate on MOP 131 in order to bring their collective expertise together in ways that would be useful to water resources engineers and managers around the world. The professionals that contributed to the preparation, review, editing, and finalization of MOP 131 are hopeful that MOP 131 is adopted by the water resources community as the definitive publication on the state of the art of automatic canal control, and that automatic canal control will make a substantial contribution to the production of food and fiber for a world that is facing unrelenting increases in the demand for food production with limited water supplies, while at the same time meeting demands to preserve our environment.

  Explanation: This study introduces a novel irrigation scheduling framework that combines three machine learning paradigms (unsupervised, supervised, and reinforcement learning) with model predictive control and multi-agent principles to design a precise irrigation scheduler for large-scale fields. The proposed framework offers several key advantages.
- **Accurate and computationally efficient soil moisture modeling:** The framework employs long short-term memory (LSTM) models to directly model the dynamic behavior of root zone soil moisture content in each irrigation management zone, while accounting for the time-varying nature of the rooting depth.
- **Management zone delineation tailored to agro-hydrological modeling:** A three-stage process with a k-means clustering approach is utilized to accurately delineate irrigation management zones. This process includes elevation and estimated soil hydraulic parameters as attributes, resulting in optimized management zones suitable for agro-hydrological modeling.
- **Enhanced computational efficiency of the mixed-integer model predictive control (MPC) framework:** A multi-agent MPC paradigm is adopted where decentralized hybrid actor-critic agents and the concept of a limiting management zone are employed to enhance the computational efficiency of the scheduler.

The application of the proposed approach to a large-scale field demonstrated its capability to achieve substantial water savings and improved irrigation water use efficiency. The proposed approach also allowed for the utilization of less conservative maximum allowable depletion (MAD) values, resulting in improved water savings and optimal crop growth.

To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces a unified, learning-based predictive irrigation scheduler that integrates machine learning and Model Predictive Control (MPC), while also incorporating multi-agent principles. The proposed framework incorporates a three-stage management zone delineation process, utilizing k-means clustering and hydraulic parameters estimates for optimized agro-hydrological modeling. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks are employed for accurate and computationally efficient root zone soil moisture modeling. The scheduler, formulated as a mixed-integer MPC with zone control, utilizes the identified LSTM networks to maximize root water uptake while minimizing overall water consumption and fixed irrigation costs. Additionally, the learning-based scheduler adopts a multi-agent MPC paradigm, where decentralized hybrid actor–critic agents and the concept of a limiting irrigation management zone are employed to enhance computational efficiency. Evaluating the performance on a 26.4-hectare field in Lethbridge for the 2015 and 2022 growing seasons demonstrates the superiority of the proposed scheduler over the widely-used triggered scheduling approach in terms of Irrigation Water Use Efficiency (IWUE) and total prescribed irrigation. Notably, the proposed approach achieves water savings between 7 to 23%, coupled with IWUE increases ranging from 10 to 35%.

Introduction According to the United Nations, agriculture accounts for approximately 70% of the world’s freshwater withdrawals, with the majority of the water being used for irrigation activities (WWAP, 2015). However, with the global freshwater shortage crisis worsening due to rapid population growth and climate change, there is a pressing need for effective water management strategies, particularly in relation to irrigation activities, in order to address the growing freshwater shortages. Closed-loop irrigation scheduling, which utilizes feedback to provide crops with precise water amounts at optimal times, has been proposed as a solution for ensuring efficient water management in irrigation. In the context of designing closed-loop irrigation schedulers, machine learning techniques and model predictive control have emerged as valuable tools. 1.1. Unsupervised learning in irrigation scheduling To improve water-use efficiency in closed-loop irrigation scheduling, it is essential to consider the inherent variability in agricultural fields, which necessitates the development of variable rate closed-loop schedulers. A key aspect of designing variable rate schedulers involves dividing the field into distinct irrigation management zones, which are characterized as homogeneous areas with similar soil properties and cropping conditions. This zoning approach enables a targeted irrigation approach, optimizing the allocation of water across different zones. Unsupervised machine learning techniques such as k-means clustering (Galambošová et al., 2014, Haghverdi et al., 2015), fuzzy c-means clustering (Fontanet et al., 2020, Li et al., 2007) and Gaussian Mixture (Yuan et al., 2022) have emerged as valuable tools in delineating fields into irrigation management zones, utilizing attributes such as yield maps, topography, satellite photographs and soil electrical conductivity. Despite the reported effectiveness of current management zone delineation approaches, designing model-based irrigation schedulers for these zones presents challenges. A significant challenge is that existing methods do not explicitly consider crucial model inputs, such as soil hydraulic parameters, mainly due to difficulties in obtaining accurate field-scale hydraulic parameter data. One practical approach to obtain soil hydraulic parameters at field scale is to estimate these parameters using field measurements. Remarkably, the literature has not yet investigated the utilization of estimated soil hydraulic parameters for the purpose of defining irrigation management zones that can be effectively modeled using agro-hydrological models. 1.2. Supervised learning in irrigation scheduling Supervised machine learning techniques have been utilized to develop efficient and accurate agro-hydrological models, enabling the design of robust irrigation schedulers. Notably, long short-term memory networks (LSTMs) (Adeyemi et al., 2018, Agyeman, Sahoo et al., 2023, Jiménez et al., 2020) and feed-forward neural networks (Gu, Zhu, Jiao, Xu, & Qi, 2021) have gained attention in this context. Despite their success, challenges persist in these modeling approaches. For example, previous LSTM models (Adeyemi et al., 2018, Agyeman, Sahoo et al., 2023) predicted soil moisture at a single location within the crop’s rooting depth, neglecting the fact that crops extract water from multiple locations. An attempt to address this in Gu et al. (2021) involved training multiple feedforward neural networks to predict soil moisture at specific locations within the rooting depth, with irrigation schedules derived through a weighted average of the model predictions. However, this method, while effective, poses challenges for optimization-based irrigation schedulers, as integrating multiple neural network predictions significantly increases computational complexity and time. Additionally, the feed-forward neural network in Gu et al. (2021) has a limitation, considering only a single rooting depth and not accommodating the time-varying nature of rooting depth, potentially impacting irrigation schedule accuracy. The literature has yet to explore the development of a concise data-driven model using machine learning to directly predict root zone soil moisture content while considering dynamic changes in rooting depth. 1.3. Scheduling In a broad context, ‘scheduling’ involves determining the optimal allocation of limited resources to achieve a specific objective. Scheduling is a decision-making process aimed at optimizing one or more objectives, considering the ongoing processes and their interactions with the environment. The challenges of scheduling are prevalent in various manufacturing and chemical processing systems. Numerous approaches have been proposed to address scheduling problems in chemical process systems. For instance, dynamic optimization-based scheduler formulations, as seen in Flores-Tlacuahuac and Grossmann (2006) and Zhuge and Ierapetritou (2014), have been employed to account for the dynamic nature of chemical processes. Furthermore, insights from Subramanian, Maravelias, and Rawlings (2012) have facilitated the transformation of scheduling models into state–space form. Reactive scheduling (Mendez and Cerdá, 2004, Touretzky et al., 2017), robust scheduling (Li & Floudas, 2014) and closed-loop scheduling (Gupta et al., 2016, Subramanian et al., 2012) approaches have been introduced to handle uncertainties’ impact on schedule quality. Another emerging area is the integration of production scheduling and process control (Burnak et al., 2018, Zhuge and Ierapetritou, 2012), driven by the substantial economic benefits derived from a closer integration of scheduling and supervisory control. 1.4. Model predictive control Model Predictive Control (MPC) has significantly shaped control practice, especially in addressing constrained multivariable control problems. It operates by synthesizing control inputs through the iterative solution of finite horizon optimal control problems across overlapping horizons. Recently, MPC theory and methods have found application in addressing scheduling problems (Subramanian et al., 2012). Notably, MPC has been extended to scheduling-related domains like inventory control (Yi & Reklaitis, 2015) and supply chain management (Subramanian, Rawlings, & Maravelias, 2014). In the field of irrigation scheduling, set-point tracking MPC (Delgoda et al., 2016, McCarthy et al., 2014) and zone MPC (Nahar, Liu, Mao, Liu, & Shah, 2019) have been utilized to calculate irrigation schedules. It is important to note that these MPC-based irrigation schedulers primarily focused on continuous-valued inputs. However, scheduling problems inherently involve combinatorial aspects, requiring discrete decisions to allocate limited resources over time. For instance, in the daily irrigation scheduling problem, determining the irrigation time involves discrete decision-making. Recent research has shown that discrete-valued controls can be directly integrated into the MPC framework with minimal adjustments to stability properties (Rawlings & Risbeck, 2017). Consequently, this has led to the application of mixed-integer MPC to address scheduling challenges in various domains, including chemical production systems (Risbeck et al., 2018, Subramanian et al., 2012). In the field of irrigation scheduling, a novel approach, namely LSTM-based mixed-integer MPC with zone control, was proposed in Agyeman, Sahoo et al. (2023) to address the daily irrigation scheduling problem. Despite advancements in optimization techniques, mixed-integer MPC still encounters computational challenges, particularly in large-scale systems. Therefore, there is a need to develop techniques that can efficiently solve mixed-integer MPC problems within a reasonable time frame. In this context, the sigmoid function approach was employed to enhance the computational efficiency of mixed-integer MPC-based irrigation schedulers (Agyeman, Sahoo et al., 2023). Despite its success, it is essential to address its limitations, such as approximation errors and occasional challenges with poorly conditioned optimization problems. Overcoming these issues can be achieved by leveraging the current achievements of reinforcement learning in addressing complex problems. An additional under-explored aspect is the comprehensive evaluation of the real benefits associated with adopting MPC methods in irrigation scheduling. Despite the potential advantages, such as enhanced irrigation water-use efficiency compared to the widely-used triggered approach, a notable research gap exists in the lack of extensive comparative analyses between MPC-based scheduling and the standard approach. Bridging this gap is important for promoting the wider adoption of MPC-based schedulers in practical irrigation settings. 1.5. Reinforcement learning in irrigation scheduling Reinforcement learning (RL), a subset of machine learning designed for decision-making in dynamic environments, plays a pivotal role in addressing key challenges in irrigation scheduling. Applied to this context, RL has demonstrated its utility in handling uncertainties associated with weather conditions, improving robustness, automating sensor data acquisition, and calculating irrigation schedules (Chen et al., 2021, Ding and Du, 2020, Yang et al., 2020). RL has also introduced a new approach to solving complex optimal control problems like mixed-integer MPC (Vinyals et al., 2019). Various strategies, such as hierarchical structures (Masson et al., 2016, Wei et al., 2018), and hybrid actor–critic approaches (Fan, Su, Zhang, & Yu, 2019), have been proposed to adapt RL algorithms for handling both discrete and continuous actions inherent in mixed-integer optimal control problems. Despite these advancements, research on RL for mixed-integer optimal control problems in engineering applications remains limited (Xu & Lin, 2023). Furthermore, the application of RL techniques to mixed-integer MPC problems in irrigation scheduling has not been explored. 1.6. Scope of work From the above, it is evident that existing irrigation schedulers primarily focus on utilizing individual machine learning paradigms to tackle specific challenges inherent in the irrigation scheduling problem. Likewise, MPC-based irrigation schedulers primarily integrate one of these machine learning paradigms into their design. The potential advantages of harmonizing these methodologies have yet to be explored within a single irrigation scheduling framework. Accordingly, the main objective of this study is to propose a novel irrigation scheduling framework that incorporates all three machine learning paradigms and mixed-integer MPC within a unified framework. In the effort to integrate all three machine learning paradigms and mixed-integer MPC into a single framework, this work makes the following contributions: 1. The development of a three-stage irrigation management zone process that incorporates k-means clustering and estimated soil hydraulic parameters to delineate large-scale agricultural fields into irrigation management zones optimized for agro- hydrological modeling. 2. The utilization of LSTM networks to develop a computationally efficient data-driven models capable of directly predicting root zone soil moisture content while accounting for dynamic nature of the crop rooting depth. 3. The use of decentralized hybrid actor–critic agents and the concept of a limiting irrigation management zone to enhance the computational efficiency of mixed-integer MPC for irrigation scheduling in agricultural fields with multiple management zones. 4. The demonstration of the effectiveness of the proposed scheduling approach on a real field. During this demonstration, a comparison between the proposed MPC-based scheduling approach and the widely employed scheduling approach is performed in terms of irrigation water-use efficiency and total prescribed irrigation. This paper extends the findings presented in Agyeman, Nouri, Appels and Liu (2023). In contrast to Agyeman, Nouri et al. (2023), the current work introduces a new approach that leverages LSTM networks to develop computationally efficient data-driven models. Additionally, this study employs decentralized hybrid actor–critic agents and introduces the concept of a limiting management zone to enhance the computational efficiency of the mixed-integer MPC-based irrigation scheduler. Furthermore, the paper conducts a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed scheduling framework on a large-scale agricultural field. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. k-means clustering for management zone delineation In the context of designing efficient closed-loop irrigation schedulers, the process of management zone delineation assumes an important role as an essential initial step. To this end, this study proposes a three-stage approach for management zone delineation that incorporates k-means clustering and estimated soil hydraulic parameters. The resulting management zones from this approach are optimized for agro-hydrological modeling. A detailed explanation of the various stages is provided below. 1. Stage 1: delineation according to crop type. The initial step in the proposed approach involves creating uniform areas within an agricultural field based on the diverse crops present. This step is important, as irrigation scheduling is significantly influenced by the varying water requirements of different crops. Given the common practice of cultivating a variety of crops in irrigated fields, using crop type as a basis for the initial delineation allows the subsequent stages of the proposed approach to effectively address the specific water needs of individual crops present in the agricultural field. 2. Stage 2: delineation according to elevation and soil-hydraulic parameters. In this stage, the management zones identified in Stage 1 undergo further refinement into uniform areas by incorporating elevation and soil hydraulic parameter attributes. The inclusion of elevation information is vital for ensuring effective irrigation management, as elevation significantly governs water movement within agricultural fields. Similarly, soil hydraulic parameters play a crucial role in irrigation scheduling, influencing soil moisture dynamics and water availability to crops. Elevation information can be readily obtained at the field scale through methods such as surveying or utilizing digital elevation models. Nevertheless, accurate determination of soil hydraulic parameters at the field scale poses challenges. To overcome this, this study employs a computationally efficient offline estimation technique, as previously proposed in Agyeman, Orouskhani, and Liu (2022) and Orouskhani, Agyeman, and Liu (2022), for acquiring soil hydraulic parameters in this stage. In this offline estimation step, soil moisture and hydraulic parameters are simultaneously estimated by assimilating remotely sensed soil moisture observations into the Richards equation using the extended Kalman filtering technique. For further details on the estimation approach in this stage of the delineation process, interested readers may refer to Agyeman et al. (2022) and Orouskhani et al. (2022). The specific hydraulic parameters used in this stage include saturated hydraulic conductivity ( ), saturated moisture content ( ), residual moisture content ( ), and curve fitting parameters ( , ). After obtaining the elevation information and soil hydraulic parameters attributes, they are combined to form the primary dataset for management zone delineation. Due to differences in magnitudes between elevation values and the soil hydraulic parameter estimates, the primary dataset exhibits features with considerable variations in magnitude. Consequently, the dataset undergoes normalization to standardize all features to a consistent magnitude level. To identify the optimal number of clusters or management zones, the elbow method is employed. Once identified, clustering is conducted on the normalized data using the k-means method to obtain the distinct management zones. The choice of the k-means clustering method is justified by its efficiency in handling large datasets and its simplicity in implementation. A summary of the key steps involved in this stage of the delineation process can be found in Fig. 1. 3. Stage 3: mapping homogeneous areas to irrigation equipment resolution. Subsequent to the clustering in the second stage, the resultant management zones often display irregular shapes, presenting challenges in the efficient application of water using the field’s irrigation equipment. To overcome this, the management zones are refined by subdividing them into smaller, more uniform sub-zones. This adjustment aligns the zones with the resolution of the field’s irrigation equipment, enhancing precision and efficiency in irrigation application. Remark 1 While the k-means approach is chosen for its simplicity, computational efficiency and extensive use in management zone delineation, it is important to acknowledge that it does not guarantee the discovery of the optimal number of clusters (or management zones). This limitation arises from its tendency to converge to local optima solutions, a consequence of the iterative nature of the algorithm starting from random initial centroids. On the other hand, alternative clustering approaches, such as the Global Optimal Search (GOS) (Tan, Broach, & Floudas, 2007), offer the potential to overcome this limitation. GOS is more likely to converge to a global optimum, especially when a reliable initial guess for the clustering data is available. In situations where achieving a globally optimal solution is key, approaches like GOS becomes more suitable. The GOS method can replace the k-means approach in the proposed management zone delineation process in a straightforward manner.

Data-driven soil moisture modeling with LSTM networks The second pivotal phase in designing a model-based closed-loop irrigation scheduler involves creating agro-hydrological models that are both computationally efficient and accurate in describing soil moisture dynamics within each irrigation management zone obtained in Section 2.1. This section introduces an approach for identifying concise data-driven agro-hydrological models using LSTM networks. LSTM networks are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that can effectively capture long term dependencies. This special type of RNN is selected for its effectiveness in representing complex causal systems, such as an agro-hydrological system. It is noteworthy that leveraging long-term, in situ soil water measurements and weather data from agricultural fields is one of the most effective approaches for accurately identifying data-driven agro-hydrological models. However, in situations where long-term data is not readily available, utilizing open-loop simulated data from properly calibrated mechanistic models serves as a valuable alternative for developing accurate data-driven models. In this study, the latter approach, depicted in Fig. 2, is employed to identify data-driven agro-hydrological models for the delineated management zones. The management zone delineation approach presented in Section 2.1 relies on soil hydraulic parameters estimated from real-time soil moisture measurements obtained from the field under study. Consequently, the soil hydraulic parameters corresponding to the centroid of each management zone (or cluster) are expected to offer a reliable representation of the soil properties within each respective zone. By calibrating a mechanistic agro-hydrological model with these centroidal soil hydraulic parameters, the mechanistic model is anticipated to accurately describe the soil moisture dynamics in each management zone. Subsequently, open-loop simulated data from this calibrated model can be utilized to develop an accurate data-driven agro-hydrological model for the respective management zone. Download : Download high-res image (425KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. LSTM network development. This section begins with a description of the mechanistic agro-hydrological model, specifically the Richards equation, that is employed in this study. It concludes with a discussion on how LSTM networks can be leveraged to identify a compact data-driven agro-hydrological model capable of predicting root zone soil moisture content in each management zone while accounting for the time-varying nature of crop rooting depth, using open-loop simulated data from the calibrated Richards equation. 2.2.1. Richards equation The Richards equation is a mechanistic agro-hydrological model that can be used to model the transport of water in soil. In this study, the 1D version (in the axial direction) of the Richards equation, calibrated with the centroidal soil hydraulic parameters in each management zone, is employed to accurately describe the water transport within each zone. This choice is justified by considering that elevation information was factored into the management zone delineation process, and as a result, the elevation profile within a specific management zone is expected to remain relatively uniform. The 1D version of the Richards equation is expressed as: (1) In Eq. (1), is the capillary pressure head, which describes the status of water in soil, represents time, is the spatial coordinate, is the unsaturated hydraulic water conductivity, is the capillary capacity. Note that and are parameterized functions that are relevant for solving Eq. (1). is a dimensionless stress water factor, is the root water uptake model which is a function of the crop coefficient , the reference evapotranspiration , and the rooting depth . In order to solve the 1D Richards equation numerically, the following boundary conditions are typically imposed: (2) (3) where , , and in Eqs. (2), (3) represent the depth of the soil column, the irrigation rate and the evaporation rate, respectively. The method of lines numerical approach proposed in Agyeman, Sahoo et al. (2023) is employed to solve Eq. (1). Additionally, the precise mathematical expressions for , and can be found in Agyeman et al. (2021). Interested readers may refer to the aforementioned references for a detailed explanation of the numerical approach. Furthermore, once a numerical value of the capillary pressure head is obtained, the volumetric soil moisture content can be obtained as follows: (4) where the parameters in Eq. (4) are as defined in Section 2.1. In the calibration process of the 1D Richards equations, the centroidal hydraulic parameters are utilized to parameterize functions , , and . The calibrated 1D Richards equation, after applying the method of lines approach, can be written in state–space form as: (5) (6) where represents the state vector containing capillary pressure head values for the spatial nodes in the soil column. represents the input vector containing the irrigation amount, precipitation, daily reference evapotranspiration, the crop coefficient, and the rooting depth. is the model disturbance, and represents the 5 centroidal hydraulic parameters. The volumetric water content is chosen as the output . Eq. (6) is thus a general representation of Eq. (4) and represents the output vector containing volumetric soil moisture content values for the corresponding spatial nodes in the soil column. 2.2.2. Training data generation The training dataset is generated by solving Eqs. (5), (6) for randomly generated inputs and initial states , with some level of noise included in the simulations to account for model uncertainty and to enhance the generalization ability and robustness of the LSTM network. Model uncertainty is treated as additive in nature. During open-loop simulations of the Richards equation, this uncertainty is modeled through realizations drawn from a Gaussian distribution with zero mean. The variance of this distribution is determined based on simulation experiments, ensuring a realistic representation of uncertainty. The use of randomly generated inputs and initial states is suggested to ensure that the dataset encompasses the dynamics of soil moisture under various conditions. For irrigation scheduling purposes, it is important to focus on the soil moisture dynamics in the entire root zone of a particular management zone. Thus, once the open-loop simulations are completed, the computation of root zone soil water content at each time step in the dataset becomes necessary. In this study, this is achieved by utilizing the volumetric soil moisture content vector obtained at each time step in the dataset. To determine the root zone soil moisture content, a weighted sum is applied to the elements in the volumetric soil moisture content vector. The weights are assigned as follows: 40% to the average volumetric moisture content value in the upper quarter of the rooting depth , 30% to the average value in the second quarter, 20% to the average value in the third quarter, and 10% to the average value in the last quarter. This weighting effectively captures the relative importance of moisture at different depths within the crop rooting depth, ensuring an effective representation of root zone soil moisture dynamics for irrigation scheduling purposes. 2.2.3. Model design The LSTM network is trained to make daily predictions of the root zone volumetric moisture content. Its primary objective is to forecast the root zone volumetric water content one day ahead ( ), denoted as . To achieve this, the network utilizes both current ( ) and past inputs ( , , …, ), where represents the time lag (in days) or sequence length used for model development. The specific inputs to the network include the root zone volumetric water content , precipitation (i.e. the sum of rain and irrigation rate) , crop coefficient , reference evapotranspiration , and the rooting depth . The incorporation of rooting depth as an input into the model is crucial because it enables the network to account for the time-varying nature of the rooting depth. Mathematically, the identified LSTM model can be expressed as: (7) where ≔ and . In Eq. (7), is a compact representation of the weights and biases of the LSTM network . 2.2.4. Model evaluation A comparative study is conducted to assess the predictive performance of the trained LSTM networks. In this comparative study, a specific initial state is chosen, and predetermined trajectories are defined for the precipitation, crop coefficient, and reference evapotranspiration inputs over a specified period. Subsequently, both the identified LSTM network and its corresponding calibrated 1D Richards equation are simulated using the selected initial state and predefined input trajectories. The predictions generated by the data-driven model are then compared against the computed root zone soil moisture content obtained from the calibrated Richards equation. The assessment of prediction accuracy utilizes the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), as expressed by Eq. (B.1) in Appendix B.3. 2.3. Mixed-integer MPC with zone control for irrigation scheduling The irrigation scheduling problem, originally proposed in Agyeman, Sahoo et al. (2023), is modeled as a variant of the warehouse location problem, where the irrigation implementing equipment plays the role of a warehouse, and the decision to operate the equipment is treated as the decision to operate a warehouse. In this context, the fixed cost of operating the equipment is analogously considered as the fixed cost of opening a warehouse, while the variable cost of supplying water to the agricultural field is equated to the variable cost of operating a warehouse. The objective function is to minimize the total cost (fixed and variable) of operating the irrigation equipment over a planning horizon, subject to constraints that ensure that the demand for water in each management zone is met, and that the total supply of water does not exceed the capacity of the irrigation equipment. To modify the formulation to maintain the root zone soil moisture within a target zone, a penalty for violating the target zone is added to the objective function, and the constraints are updated to ensure that the root zone soil moisture is maintained within the target zone. Furthermore, the dynamics of root zone soil moisture must be considered during the planning horizon, as the root zone soil moisture level changes over the planning horizon. This modified formulation results in a mixed-integer MPC problem with zone objectives (zone control), where the identified data-driven agro-hydrological model for each management zone is employed as the dynamic model in the formulation. Additionally, a soft constraint approach is employed to realize the objective of maintaining the root zone soil moisture in the target zone where slack variables are introduced in the formulation to relax the bounds of the target zone. By solving the mixed-integer MPC with zone objectives problem, the optimal schedules (daily irrigation decision and daily irrigation rate) for operating the irrigation equipment can be determined that minimize the total cost of operation while maintaining the root zone soil moisture within the target zone throughout the planning horizon. To facilitate a better understanding of the proposed scheduler formulation for fields comprising multiple management zones, the formulation is initially applied to a field with a single management zone. For day within a planning horizon of days, the scheduler is formulated for a single management zone as follows: (8a) (8b) (8c) (8d) (8e) (8f) (8g) where , ≔ , ≔ , ≔ , ≔ , and ≔ where . and ((8a), (8g)) are nonnegative slack variables that are introduced to relax the bounds of the target zone in (8d). In this work, and (also known as the threshold volumetric moisture content ) are calculated as follows: (9) (10) where is the volumetric moisture content at field capacity, represents the volumetric water content at the wilting point, and MAD refers to the management allowable depletion, which indicates the fraction of the total available water that is permitted to be depleted. The per-unit costs associated with the violation of the lower and upper bounds of the target zone are represented with and , respectively. and represent the per-unit cost of the applied irrigation amount and the fixed cost associated with operating the irrigation implementing equipment, respectively. The binary decision variable encodes the daily irrigation decision. The cost function (8a) incorporates the objectives of maintaining the root zone volumetric moisture content in a target zone in order to ensure optimal water uptake in crops by minimizing the violation of the target zone , minimizing the irrigation cost , and minimizing the irrigation amount . Constraint (8b) corresponds to the LSTM model of the root zone volumetric moisture content, and in this constraint represents the weights and bias terms associated with the identified LSTM model. In this work, the initial state is represented with Constraint (8c). Its value is assumed to be known during the evaluation of the scheduler. In particular, it is chosen to be the estimated state obtained after the state and parameter estimation step outlined in Section 2.1 has converged. Constraint (8e) refers to the maximum amount of water that can be supplied during an irrigation event on day . When the irrigation decision on day is “a no decision” ( ), Constraint (8e) requires that the irrigation rate must be set to 0. Conversely, when the irrigation decision on a particular day is “a yes decision” ( ), Constraint (8e) specifies that the prescribed irrigation rate must not exceed its upper bound ( ) and must be at least as large as its lower bound ( ). After providing a detailed description of the scheduler design for a single management zone, the daily scheduler for a field with management zones is formulated as follows: (11a) (11b) (11c) (11d) (11e) (11f) (11g) where , , ≔ , ≔ , and ≔ . is a closed set that contains the positional indices of the management zones. Essentially, the formulation aims to duplicate the formulation for each of the management zones present in the field. Furthermore, it is apparent that in all management zones, the binary values over the planning horizon remain the same in . 2.4. Enhancing the computational efficiency of : Decentralized hybrid actor-critic agents and limiting management zone While numerical optimization methods, such as the branch and bound technique, can be used to solve , they may encounter computational challenges, especially when dealing with agricultural fields comprising a large number of irrigation management zones. To overcome these computational issues, this study proposes an alternative approach employing decentralized hybrid actor–critic agents and the concept of a limiting irrigation management zone to enhance the computational efficiency of . This section begins with a detailed description of how the hybrid actor–critic agent is employed to train an agent for a specific management zone of the field. It concludes with a discussion of how the decentralized agents and the concept of a limiting management zone are combined to enhance the computational efficiency of the scheduler. 2.4.1. Agent design and training This study proposes the training of a RL agent for each of the management zones present in the agricultural field. Each agent is trained to determine the daily irrigation decision (discrete action) and the daily irrigation rate (continuous action) that optimize root water uptake while minimizing irrigation costs and total water consumption in a management zone. The hybrid actor–critic approach, as originally introduced in Fan et al. (2019), is adopted for the training of each agent due to its demonstrated effectiveness in handling both discrete and continuous action spaces. This hybrid actor–critic architecture comprises two parallel actor networks, where one actor learns the discrete action (daily irrigation decision in this work) and the other learns the continuous action (daily irrigation rate in this work). The parallel actors share a single critic network, which serves as an estimate of the state-value function. The RL framework of the agent is modeled as a fully observable Markov Decision Process (MDP), comprising several elements such as observations, actions, rewards, and transition/dynamics functions. This section begins with a detailed description of the environment with which the hybrid actor–critic agent interacts during its training stage. Additionally, the design of the observations which serve as inputs to the agent’s policy is outlined. Subsequently, the reward design employed in agent training is discussed, followed by a discussion of the agent’s training. Environment design. In the training process of a hybrid actor–critic agent, the environmental dynamics are represented by a 1D Richards equation calibrated with the centroidal hydraulic parameters of the relevant management zone. The delineation of management zones is based on soil hydraulic parameters estimated from real-time observations in the agricultural field. Utilizing a 1D Richards equation calibrated with the centroidal hydraulic parameters of each management zone ensures an accurate description of the soil moisture dynamics within the considered management zone. The transition dynamics for this calibrated 1D Richards equation are detailed in Eqs. (5), (6). Observation design. The policy of the hybrid actor–critic agent receives as input the output vector , denoting the volumetric moisture contents obtained from Eq. (6), alongside the reference evapotranspiration, crop coefficient, and rooting depth on day . These inputs, collectively represented as , provide essential information to the agent’s policy, aiding in the accurate determination of daily irrigation schedules. The output vector, constituting the first element of the observation vector, is considered a reliable representation of the volumetric soil distribution in the management zone under consideration. This reliability arises from its initialization with converged volumetric moisture content estimates obtained from the offline simultaneous state and parameter estimation in Stage 2 of the management zone delineation process. Additionally, reference evapotranspiration and crop coefficient can be readily obtained from weather predictions and empirical relations, respectively. The rooting depth can also be determined based on the crop’s growth stage. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the observation provided to the policy of the proposed agent is known, justifying the adoption of the fully observable MDP framework during the training of the agents. Reward design. The reward function employed during the training of the agents is expressed as: (12) (13) In Eqs. (12), (13), , , , , , and have the same definitions as in the scheduler formulation of . represents the root zone soil moisture on day , which is calculated using the weighted average approach outlined in Section 2.2.2. The agent incurs a penalty of when its actions result in the root zone soil moisture content falling below the lower threshold . Similarly, the agent is penalized with if its actions cause the root zone soil moisture content to exceed the upper threshold . When the agent successfully maintains the root zone soil moisture within the desired range, it receives a reward of 0. A penalty of is incurred when the agent decides to perform irrigation (indicated by a “yes” decision) and a penalty of is incurred for a non-zero irrigation rate. Agent training. The Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm (Schulman, Wolski, Dhariwal, Radford, & Klimov, 2017) is applied for policy optimization in the parallel actors. During the training stage of the agent, to generate a stochastic policy for the irrigation decision, the discrete actor network of the hybrid PPO outputs two values for the 2 discrete actions (0,1). Additionally, the discrete action is sampled from the softmax distribution. The continuous actor network of the hybrid PPO generates the stochastic policy for the daily irrigation rate by outputting the mean and variance for the daily irrigation rate action. For a more detailed understanding of the PPO algorithm and the hybrid PPO approach, interested readers may refer to Fan et al. (2019) and Schulman et al. (2017), respectively.

Hybrid actor–critic architecture, and agent–environment interaction. 2.4.2. A multi-agent MPC paradigm: Limiting management zone and evaluation of After training the hybrid PPO agents, each agent is utilized to determine the irrigation decisions and rates for its corresponding management zone. As these agents are intended to contribute to the solution of formulation , each agent undergoes evaluation across the planning horizon used in . The evaluation of each agent over the horizon involves providing the necessary inputs, such as the initial volumetric moisture content for a specific day and predicted/forecasted uncontrolled inputs (reference evapotranspiration, crop coefficient, and rooting depths) over the prediction horizon, to the policy of the trained agent. In response, the trained agent yields optimal or near-optimal irrigation decisions and rates for the planning horizon by interacting with the calibrated 1D Richards equation of the relevant management zone. The interaction between a hybrid agent and its environment is illustrated in Fig. 4. In this figure, the predicted uncontrolled inputs over are represented as , with the initial volumetric moisture content denoted as . Furthermore, and in Fig. 4 correspond to the daily irrigation decision and daily irrigation depth prescribed by the agent. This evaluation yields an irrigation decision sequence and an irrigation depth sequence, designated as and , respectively. The evaluation process is repeated for all agents to generate irrigation decision sequences and irrigation depth sequences. The decentralized approach employed during the training of the hybrid agents results in a situation where the irrigation decision sequences obtained for all the management zones are nonuniform. However, this nonuniformity in irrigation decision sequences is inconsistent with the requirements of formulation , which demands a uniform irrigation decision sequence across the management zones. The concept of a limiting management zone is employed to address the nonuniformity arising from the decentralized nature of agent training. The limiting irrigation management zone is defined as the th management zone that exhibits the earliest non-zero irrigation decision within the planning horizon. The irrigation decision sequence of the limiting management zone is chosen as a binding irrigation decision sequence for all the management zones. By adopting the irrigation decision sequence from the limiting management zone as the binding sequence, the scheduler can ensure timely irrigation across all management zones. An illustrative example can help clarify the concepts of the limiting irrigation management zone and binding irrigation sequence. Consider a field divided into three management zones: , , and . Each zone has its own hybrid PPO agent with a designated policy: , , and . On a given day, denoted as , the observations within each management zone are represented as , , and . It is assumed that the agents are evaluated for a planning horizon of seven days. After evaluating the agents, the following irrigation sequences ( ) were obtained: , , and . Based on the irrigation sequences obtained, it is evident that exhibits the earliest non-zero irrigation decision among all the management zones. Consequently, is identified as the limiting irrigation management zone. By designating as the limiting management zone, it is established that the irrigation decisions made within serve as the reference for irrigation scheduling in the other zones. The binding sequence of , , is enforced in and . Once the binding irrigation decision sequence is determined, it is enforced in . Given that the binary variables over the planning horizon (binding irrigation decision sequence) in have already been calculated, the nonlinear programming version of can be solved to determine the irrigation rates over the planning horizon in the management zones. This approach transforms from a Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Program (MINLP) to a Nonlinear Programming (NLP) problem, significantly enhancing the computational efficiency of . The solution of the NLP version of can be avoided altogether. Instead, copies of the NLP version of corresponding to the management zones can be solved in parallel, after the binding irrigation decision sequence has been enforced in each formulation. It is evident from that the irrigation decision sequence is responsible for the coupling among the management zones in . Additionally, formulation merely replicates formulation in the management zones. Thus, after the irrigation decision sequence in has been determined using the binding irrigation decision sequence approach, the NLP version of can be solved in each of the management zones in parallel. This parallel execution can take advantage of the multicore architecture of modern CPUs, leading to substantial reductions in computation time and significantly improving the overall computational efficiency of the scheduler. Fig. 5 illustrates the comprehensive approach incorporating hybrid PPO agents, the limiting management zone, and the copies of . The irrigation rates determined by the hybrid PPO agent in the limiting management zone can be directly implemented as they align with the binding irrigation decision sequence across the planning horizon. However, for the remaining management zones, the irrigation rates obtained from the hybrid PPO agents can only serve as a reliable initial guess, as they do not precisely match the binding sequence. In these management zones, the NLP versions of must necessarily be solved to obtain the optimal irrigation rates. Notably, an irrigation rate sequence is considered to align with an irrigation decision sequence when a non-zero irrigation rate in the sequence corresponds to a decision of an irrigation decision of 1, and a zero irrigation rate in the sequence corresponds to an irrigation decision of 0. This consistency must be maintained for all days within the planning horizon. Remark 2 The integration of decisions from hybrid actor–critic agents into the MPC layer demonstrates a cooperation between multi-agent systems and MPC, leading to what can be referred to as a multi-agent MPC paradigm. This approach shares some similarities with distributed MPC and coalitional MPC methods, where decisions are made locally by individual agents/control units based on localized information to achieve a global objective. However, there are notable differences between the proposed approach and these control methods. Hybrid actor–critic agents, which eventually aid in determining irrigation decisions, are trained in a fully decentralized manner, without inter-agent communication during their training phase. This training also ignores the coupling constraint of the irrigation scheduling problem that necessitates uniform daily irrigation decisions across all management zones/agents. To manage this constraint, the proposed approach adopts a heuristic method based on a limiting management zone to reconcile the daily irrigation decisions when the agents are executed. This decentralized training contrasts with distributed or coalitional methods that generally involve agent communication to enhance performance. Moreover, the heuristic method for addressing coupling constraints deviates from consensus algorithms and coordination schemes typically used in distributed training techniques to handle coupling constraints. Furthermore, the proposed approach relies on the reconciled irrigation decisions to solve multiple MPCs in parallel so as to determine the optimal irrigation rates for each management zone. This process is characterized as fully decentralized MPC since it does not involve communication between the local MPCs of different management zones, differing from distributed or coalitional MPC approaches that would involve inter-local MPC communication. Importantly, the adoption of a fully decentralized MPC approach in determining the irrigation rates for different management zones assumes a weak coupling between these zones. While this approach is suitable for large-scale fields, such as the field considered in the work, it is inappropriate for smaller, spatially variable fields where a stronger coupling exists between management zones. In such scenarios, a distributed MPC approach, which involves communication between local MPCs to ensure the system’s closed-loop stability, would be more suitable.

Comparative evaluation of proposed and triggered irrigation scheduling methods Evaluating the benefits of the proposed irrigation scheduling approach over the entire crop growing season is essential for understanding its effectiveness. To achieve this, the study employs the widely employed triggered irrigation scheduling approach as a benchmark. A comparison is made between the proposed scheduler and the triggered approach in terms of Irrigation Water Use Efficiency (IWUE), also known as water productivity and total irrigation prescribed. Despite the fundamental differences, comparing the two approaches in terms of IWUE and total prescribed irrigation is considered essential for several reasons. Firstly, the triggered approach serves as a widely adopted and practical benchmark, allowing for the evaluation of potential improvements offered by the more advanced MPC-based scheduling. Furthermore, the comparison offers insights into the water conservation capabilities of each approach, providing valuable considerations for the adoption of sustainable agriculture practices in response to the challenges of global water scarcity. This section first provides a description of the triggered irrigation scheduling approach. It then proceeds to explain the calculation of the irrigation water use efficiency. 2.5.1. Triggered irrigation scheduling This scheduling approach aims to maintain the root zone soil moisture within the lower and upper bounds of a target zone. In this approach, an irrigation event is triggered on a specific day, denoted as , when the daily root zone moisture content, represented by , falls below the lower bound of the target zone, denoted as . When such a situation occurs, the irrigation rate for that day, denoted as , is calculated using the following formula (Gu et al., 2021): (14) In Eq. (14), represents the rooting depth, while corresponds to the upper bound of the target zone. indicates the cumulative precipitation that occurs from day to . The interested reader may refer to Gu et al. (2020) and the references therein for a thorough discussion of this scheduling approach. 2.5.2. Irrigation water use efficiency In this work, the Irrigation Water Use Efficiency (IWUE) in kg/m is calculated as follows (15) where is the predicted yield in (kg/m2) and IRR is the total prescribed irrigation depth applied in meters ( ). The detailed calculation of can be found in Appendix A. 2.6. Study area A large-scale agricultural field is employed to assess the benefits of the proposed scheduling approach. The field in question is a Research Farm operated by Lethbridge College and it spans an area of 26.4 hectares. The field is located in Lethbridge, southern Alberta, with geographic coordinates approximately at latitude 49.72°N and longitude 112.80°W. A layout of the investigated field is shown in Fig. 6(a). The average elevation of the area is 888 m. Regarding the soil composition, the predominant texture in the field is clayey loam, with occasional presence of sand lenses. To facilitate effective irrigation management, a five-span center pivot system has been installed in the field. This mechanized irrigation system follows a circular pattern around a central pivot and the pivot has a total length of 294 m. Furthermore, the center pivot system incorporates a commercial variable rate irrigation system, enabling variable irrigation application rates. To monitor soil moisture levels of the field during the rotation cycle of the pivot, microwave remote sensors have been installed on the five spans of the pivot. The field exhibits varying elevations, ranging from 886 m at the lowest point to 890 m at the highest point. An interpolated field elevation map, depicted in Fig. 6(b), visually represents this elevation distribution. To prepare for the implementation of the proposed management zone delineation approach and the evaluation of proposed irrigation scheduler, soil moisture observations were collected using microwave remote sensors installed on the center pivot of the field. These observations were utilized to estimate both the soil water content and soil hydraulic parameters across the entire field. The estimation process covered the period from May 16, 2022, to August 31, 2022. In this section, two of the estimated parameters are presented: the saturated hydraulic conductivity ( ) and the curve fitting parameter ( ), to provide a brief overview of the estimation results.

Management zone delineation of the study area In this section, the proposed three-stage management zone delineation process is applied to the study area, and the results of the delineation are presented in Fig. 8. During the first stage of delineation, the field under study was divided into 4 management zones, labeled as Quadrants 1, 2, 3, and 4 in Fig. 8. This initial division is based on the fact that 4 different crop types are commonly planted in the respective quadrants of the study area. Consequently, the initial delineation of the field according to crop types results in these 4 management zones. After the initial delineation, the second stage of the process involved refining the management zones using the elevation and the estimated soil hydraulic parameters attributes within Quadrants 1, 2, 3, and 4. As shown in Fig. 8, this resulted in 5 irregularly shaped management zones in Quadrant 1, 4 irregularly shaped management zones in Quadrant 2, and 3 irregularly shaped management zones in Quadrants 3 and 4. Finally, in the third stage of the delineation process, the irregularly shaped management zones obtained in the second stage were mapped to the resolution of the field’s center pivot. Specifically, the field’s center pivot has a resolution of 12 zones and 45 zones in the radial and azimuthal directions, respectively. For simplicity and comprehensive analysis, the results for the third quadrant of the field are isolated and discussed in detail. Fig. 9(a) depicts the management zone map obtained after the second stage of the management zone delineation process. It is evident that the clustering approach resulted in three distinct, irregularly shaped management zones. Fig. 9(b) displays the spatial distribution of the three irrigation management zones, which were mapped to align with the resolution of the field’s center pivot. Based on the centroidal hydraulic parameters and the centroidal elevation, Management Zone 1 (MZ ) was found to have an average soil hydraulic parameter set corresponding to loamy soil, with an associated elevation of 889 m. Similarly, Management Zone 2 (MZ ) exhibited an average soil hydraulic parameter set of loamy soil, but with an average elevation of 888 m. In Management Zone 3 (MZ ), the average soil type was identified as sandy clay loam, and the average elevation measured 888.5 m.

Subsequently, the remaining steps of the proposed scheduling approach are specifically implemented in Quadrant 3 of the study area, for the sake of simplicity. This adopted approach also allows for a thorough examination of the outcomes obtained through the proposed scheduling approach. It should be noted that applying the same steps to the remaining quadrants can be done straightforwardly, without any loss of generality. 2.7. Simulation settings In this section, specific details regarding the simulation settings and parameters used during the application of the remaining steps of the scheduling approach to Quadrant 3 of the study area are provided. The section begins by presenting the settings and parameters employed during the development of the 3 LSTM networks for soil moisture content modeling in the 3 management zones of Quadrant 3. It then proceeds to describe the settings and parameters used during the training of distinct hybrid PPO agents for the 3 management zones of Quadrant 3. Finally, the settings, parameters, and weather data employed during the evaluation of the proposed scheduler on a large-scale agricultural field are presented. It is noteworthy that the performance of the scheduler is assessed over two growing seasons. Additionally, for each growing season, evaluations are conducted for two different Mean Absolute Difference (MAD) values: specifically, 40% and 65%. 2.7.1. LSTM network training Prior to generating the open-loop data for LSTM network development, the dynamics of soil moisture in each of the 3 management zones of Quadrant 3 was modeled using the 1D Richards equation. These Richards equations were calibrated with the centroidal hydraulic parameters specific to each irrigation management zone. Subsequently, extensive open-loop simulations of these calibrated Richards equations were conducted, incorporating randomly generated inputs (i.e. reference evapotranspiration, crop coefficient, and irrigation rate inputs) and initial states (capillary pressure head and volumetric soil moisture content). The simulation settings used during these open-loop simulations of the Richards equation are detailed in Table B.6 of Appendix B.1. To ensure accurate irrigation scheduling for the crop type present in Quadrant 3, which in this case was spring soft wheat, the LSTM training stage incorporated two different rooting depths: 0.5 m and 1.00 m. The reference evapotranspiration and crop coefficient were randomly generated within the ranges of 0.1 mm/day to 8.99 mm/day and 0.4 to 1.02, respectively, for all three management zones. The irrigation rate was randomly generated between 4.0 mm/day and 52.0 mm/day for MZ , 4.3 mm/day and 59.6 mm/day for MZ , and 5.0 mm/day and 62.3 mm/day for MZ . It is important to note that the selection of input ranges for the open-loop simulations of the calibrated 1D Richards equation was informed by historical weather data and local irrigation management practices. After computing the root zone soil moisture content at each time step using the methodology outlined in Section 2.2.2, the LSTM models were trained using the Keras Library in Python. The model architecture and hyperparameters employed during the training process are provided in Table B.7 of Appendix B.2, and it is worth mentioning that these values were determined through experimentation. Consequently, it is plausible that more optimal results could be achieved through a systematic tuning of the hyperparameter values. 2.7.2. Hybrid PPO agent training A summary of the final parameter values for the formulations and used in training 3 distinct hybrid PPO agents for the three management zones in Quadrant 3 is provided in Table D.9 of Appendix D. It is important to note that the per unit costs in these formulations were considered as tuning parameters in this study. Tuning these costs involved exploring multiple scenarios by adjusting the per unit costs in and . Through an iterative process, the performance of the agents was evaluated under different cost configurations, leading to the determination of the most suitable values for achieving the desired irrigation management objectives. The values of the volumetric moisture content at field capacity and wilting point for the various soil types present in the 3 management zones in Quadrant 3 were obtained from Ref. Huffman, Fangmeier, Elliot, and Workman (2012). To represent the policies of the actor networks for the discrete (daily irrigation decision) and continuous (daily irrigation rate) actions in each hybrid PPO agent, a fully connected multilayer perceptron with two hidden layers and a hyperbolic tangent (tanh) activation function was employed. The hyperparameters utilized during the training of the agents, as well as other settings specific to the PPO algorithm, are summarized in Table C.8 of Appendix C. Additionally since the evaluation of the scheduler under a particular growing season is done for MAD values of 40% and 65%, 3 distinct hybrid PPO agents are trained for an MAD of 40%, and another set of 3 hybrid PPO agents are trained for an MAD of 65%. The training of the hybrid PPO agents was conducted using the Tensorforce library (Schaarschmidt et al., 2018) in Python. 2.7.3. Evaluation setup and parameters for proposed scheduler As has already been mentioned, the proposed scheduler is evaluated over two growing seasons: the 2015 and 2022 seasons, for MAD values of 40% and 65%. Fig. E.16 of Appendix E.1 presents the relevant weather data utilized in this study, specifically from the selected growing seasons. It is important to note that a MAD value of 40% is commonly used for irrigation management on the Research farm, and in irrigation management, this value can be considered to be conservative. Therefore, the scheduler was further assessed using a less conservative MAD value of 65% to evaluate its ability to ensure optimal plant growth when allowing for more water depletion in the root zone. Additionally, it is worth mentioning that the 2015 season had lower total rainfall of 141.7 mm compared to the 2022 season which recorded a total value of 230.9 mm. These seasons were chosen to assess the performance of the scheduler in relatively dry and wet conditions. Soft spring wheat was cultivated in the investigated quadrant during the 2022 season, and this crop was also considered for the 2015 growing season. To determine the initial volumetric moisture content (and for that matter the initial capillary pressure head) for each management zone, the converged volumetric soil moisture estimates obtained from the estimation procedure outlined in Section 2.1 were first mapped to the management zone map of Quadrant 3. For each management zone, the volumetric soil moisture estimates corresponding to the driest plot were selected as the basis for initializing the scheduler. It is important to note, however, that the accuracy of these volumetric moisture estimates are expected to decline over time, and soil moisture content observations from the management zones in the field under study should be used to correct these estimates using various data assimilation techniques. The incorporation of data assimilation techniques in model-based irrigation schedulers is outside the scope of this work, and the interested reader may explore references such as Agyeman et al. (2021) and Bo and Liu (2020) that delve into soil moisture estimation in agro-hydrological systems. The scheduler is implemented in a receding horizon manner, where the calibrated 1D Richards equations of the three management zones serve as the representation of the real field. In the evaluation phase, a prediction horizon of 14 days is utilized. It is noteworthy that a control horizon of 14 days was also employed during the evaluation stage. Simulation experiments revealed that a 14-day prediction horizon effectively captures the essential dynamics of the agro-hydrological system examined in this study. This period also enables the scheduler to utilize the most accurate weather forecasts available. Additionally, the selected timeframe was found to be sufficiently long to ensure that the receding horizon implementation of the scheduler is stabilizing. Moreover, a 14-day prediction horizon was found to ensure computational efficiency of the scheduling process by facilitating a timely optimization process. While the true weather information, such as rainfall, reference evapotranspiration, and average temperature, is known during the simulations, uncertainty is incorporated into the weather forecasts used over the prediction horizon. This was done to assess the robustness of the scheduler to uncertainties in weather forecasts. The uncertainty in the weather forecast is modeled as a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a specified standard deviation. As the prediction horizon extends further into the future, the standard deviation values are gradually increased to reflect the increasing uncertainty associated with longer-term weather predictions. Table D.9 of Appendix D provides the relevant parameters of formulation used in evaluating the scheduler. The evaluation period for each growing season spanned from 5th May to 4th September, encompassing a total of 123 evaluations. In each evaluation, the three hybrid PPO agents were initially assessed using relevant observations from all three management zones to obtain irrigation decision sequences for the prediction horizon. Subsequently, the binding irrigation sequence was determined, and three copies of formulation (y) were simultaneously evaluated to optimize the irrigation rates for each management zone using the interior point optimization solver (Wächter & Biegler, 2006). In accordance with the receding horizon implementation of the scheduler, the first element of the optimal irrigation rates for all the three management zones were then applied to the calibrated 1D Richards equations. The soil water content resulting from the implemented irrigation rate in each management zone was then used to initialize the subsequent evaluation of the scheduler. Throughout the evaluation process, a rooting depth of 0.5 m was considered from 5th May to 15th July. From the 16th of July to the end of the growing season, a rooting depth of 1.0 m was used to determine the irrigation schedules. It is worth noting that this practice is consistent with irrigation management of the soft spring wheat crop. Both the triggered approach and the proposed approach were utilized to generate irrigation schedules for the selected growing seasons and specific MAD values. For the evaluation of the predicted yield under both scheduling schemes, the parameters and in Eq. (A.1) were set to 0.88 kg m−2 and 1.15, respectively. These values were obtained from Ref. Bennett and Harms (2011) and represent calibrated values specific to the study area. 3. Results and discussion In this section, the results obtained after the application of the proposed irrigation scheduler to Quadrant 3 of the field are presented and discussed in detail. This section begins with a presentation and discussion of the results obtained from the validation experiment conducted on the identified LSTM networks for soil moisture dynamics modeling in Quadrant 3. Next, the results of the hybrid PPO agents are presented, after which a discussion of these results is presented. Finally, the irrigation schedules, and the corresponding root zone soil moisture content obtained under the proposed and triggered irrigation scheduling schemes, over the two growing seasons, are presented and discussed in detail. 3.1. Validation of the trained LSTM networks The results of the validation experiment, which was conducted over a 30 day period, is depicted in Fig. 10. From this figure, the soil moisture predictions can be deemed accurate, since there is a good agreement between the root zone soil moisture predictions and the actual root zone soil moisture content derived from the calibrated 1D Richards equation. This accuracy is reinforced by the low RMSE values shown in Table 1, which serve to support the good predictive capacity of the identified LSTM models for root zone soil moisture content across all three management zones at depths of 0.50 m and 1.00 m. The results obtained from the validation experiment further highlight the accuracy of the identified LSTM networks in performing multi-step-ahead predictions. In this experiment, the LSTM models, originally trained to predict a single day ahead, were employed in a recursive manner across the 30-day period. This recursive strategy involved using the output at a specific time step as an input in the subsequent time step. This recursive use of the identified LSTM networks holds significance within model predictive control frameworks, such as the mixed-integer MPC with zone control formulation that is adopted for irrigation scheduling in this work. The obtained results in this section provide evidence that the proposed LSTM network root zone soil moisture modeling in the delineated management zones is both robust and accurate. These findings align with several other studies that have also utilized LSTM models to describe soil moisture dynamics in agro-hydrological systems (Adeyemi et al., 2018, Agyeman, Sahoo et al., 2023). Furthermore, these findings imply that a neural networks’ capacity for universal approximation can be harnessed to directly characterize root zone soil moisture content. This approach is anticipated to enhance the computational efficiency when employed in schedulers that require the solution of a numerical optimization problem. This new approach stands in contrast to earlier works (Gu et al., 2021), where distinct neural network models were trained to predict the soil moisture content at different depths within the soil profile, after which a weighted approach was employed to obtain the root zone soil moisture content from the soil moisture predictions. The results of the validation experiment further confirms the hypothesis that by including the rooting depth as one of the inputs to the LSTM network, the time varying nature of the rooting depth and its effect on the root zone soil moisture can be effective modeled.

Performance of the hybrid PPO agents To provide a concise summary, the trajectories of the rewards obtained during the training stage for the MAD of 40% are presented. Fig. 11 demonstrates the average episodic rewards obtained after running each agent 10 times, showing an upward trend that indicates an improvement in agent performance over successive training iterations. Additionally, the hybrid PPO agents exhibit convergence to stable and optimal policies, as evidenced by the rewards reaching a plateau during the training stage. Overall, the trained hybrid PPO agents can effectively provide optimal irrigation decisions tailored to their respective management zones. This finding aligns with earlier studies (Fan et al., 2019, Xu and Lin, 2023) that have demonstrated the ability of the hybrid actor–critic approach in achieving stable learning when employed in mixed-integer optimal control problems. The proposed hybrid actor–critic paradigm adds to the range of approximation methods aimed at simplifying mixed-integer optimal control problems. Notable alternatives include the sigmoid approximation (de Oliveira, Da Silva, Pereira, & Carneiro, 2005) and the time-step grouping (Richards & How, 2005) approach. The proposed approach offers advantages over the sigmoid approach used in the mixed-integer MPC for irrigation scheduling proposed in Agyeman, Sahoo et al. (2023) and Agyeman, Nouri et al. (2023). Specifically, the RL approach, by directly learning an optimal/near-optimal policy for the binary variable, eliminates the approximation errors associated with the sigmoid function. Additionally, the RL approach addresses interpretability issues encountered in the sigmoid approach. Moreover, compared to the complexity introduced by time step grouping method, the hybrid actor–critic paradigm, simplifies the process by directly learning optimal policies for binary variables at each time step, eliminating the need for manual decisions on strategies to group binary variables across timesteps. Despite these benefits, it is essential to note that the RL training process is time-consuming due to its complexity. Future research should explore methods to expedite agent training and determine the optimal number of training episodes for efficient agent learning.

Performance and utility of the proposed scheduler Figs. 14 and 15 depict the prescribed schedules and the dynamics of the root zone soil moisture during the 2022 growing season for MAD values of 40% and 65%, respectively. Similarly, Fig. 12, Fig. 13 show the prescribed schedules and the corresponding root zone soil moisture dynamics for the 2015 growing season with MAD values of 40% and 65%, respectively. Table 2, Table 3 present a summary of the total prescribed water and other relevant costs computed for the 2022 growing season, considering MAD values of 40% and 65% respectively. Similarly, Table 4, Table 5 provide the summary for the 2015 growing season with MAD values of 40% and 65% respectively. As mentioned previously, the 2015 growing season experienced lower total rainfall compared to the 2022 season. Consequently, both scheduling approaches resulted in higher total irrigation rates for the 2015 season compared to the 2022 season. Additionally, the results demonstrated that for an MAD of 40%, both scheduling approaches exhibited higher total irrigation rates compared to a less conservative MAD of 65%. Similarly, both approaches made more frequent irrigation decisions for an MAD of 40% compared to an MAD of 65%. This observation aligns with the definition of MAD, as a lower MAD implies a smaller allowable depletion of root zone soil moisture, necessitating more frequent irrigations and higher total irrigation application depths. Across all considered scenarios, the proposed approach consistently achieved lower total irrigation rates compared to the triggered approach. Specifically, for MAD 40%, the proposed approach saved approximately 6% and 7% of irrigation water in the 2015 and 2022 growing seasons, respectively. Similarly, for MAD 65%, the savings were about 14% and 23% for the same seasons. The obtained IWUE values indicated higher predicted crop yields under the proposed scheduling, evident from the higher IWUE values compared to the triggered approach. For MAD 40%, the proposed approach led to a 12% and 10% increase in IWUE in the 2022 and 2015 growing seasons, respectively. Likewise, for MAD 65%, there was a 35% and 20% increase in IWUE in the 2022 and 2015 growing seasons, respectively. The proposed approach exhibited more substantial water savings, particularly under the less conservative MAD value of 65%. Similarly, the enhancement in IWUE was more evident with the less conservative MAD value of 65%. The use of a conservative MAD value of 40% in irrigation scheduling aims to enhance the scheduler’s robustness against potential disturbances that could lead to crop stress. By setting the threshold further from the wilting point (critical point) with such conservative values, the likelihood of reaching critical soil moisture levels is reduced in the presence of disturbances. However, the simulation results suggest that less conservative MAD values can be employed under the proposed scheme, leading to reduced total irrigation rates while minimizing the risk of critical soil moisture levels. This indicates that the proposed approach offers flexibility in MAD selection, enabling a more efficient use of water resources while ensuring optimal crop development. In comparing the computational time between the proposed scheduler and the triggered approach, it became evident that the design and evaluation of the proposed approach required more time and computational effort. The estimation of soil hydraulic parameters for management zone delineation, along with the training of the decentralized hybrid actor–critic agents and LSTM models, constitutes the most computationally intensive and time-consuming aspects of the proposed scheduler. Notably, the use of a high-dimensional field model in the estimation increases the computational effort needed for Jacobian calculations in the EKF step. Additionally, the iterative processes and hyperparameter adjustments associated with agent and LSTM model training contribute to extended training times. However, it is crucial to clarify that these computationally demanding steps are performed offline, thereby reducing the computational load during real-time operation. During online execution, involving the evaluation of hybrid agents, determining the limiting irrigation sequence, and solving the optimization problem for irrigation rates in all management zones of the field, the proposed approach demonstrated efficient performance. Parallel computing significantly influenced this efficiency during the optimization problem solution. While the current solution time is considered adequate for a scheduler sampling time of 1 day, applying the proposed approach to shorter sampling times may pose computational challenges, especially for fields with numerous management zones. Further studies are necessary to improve the computational efficiency of the proposed scheduler to ensure timely completion of the optimization problem within the sampling time. Exploring suboptimal solutions could be a potential avenue, though this may impact the water-saving benefits of the proposed approach. Table 2.

The utilization of estimated hydraulic parameters, derived from the offline estimation in Stage 2 of the management zone delineation, as a basis for identifying the LSTM models, plays an important role in reducing parametric uncertainty and effectively addressing plant-model mismatch within the proposed scheduler. While this offline strategy serves as a good starting point for real-time implementation of the scheduler, it has limitations in adapting to real-time variations in field parameters. A more attractive approach to handle parameter variations involves performing online parameter estimation, utilizing real-time field observations for fine-tuning soil hydraulic parameters. However, it is essential to note that this online estimation approach may introduce additional computational demands to the online implementation of the scheduler. A valid alternative worth considering is the adoption of an offset-free MPC approach by incorporating a disturbance model. In this approach, managing plant-model mismatch is achieved by estimating disturbances through measurements, utilizing an augmented system that integrates the nominal model and the disturbance model. In the design of an offset-free MPC, the work presented in Cao, Son, Moon, and Kwon (2021) could serve as a helpful reference. 4. Conclusion In conclusion, this study successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of integrating the three machine learning paradigms (unsupervised, supervised, and reinforcement learning) with model predictive control and multi-agent principles to design a precise irrigation scheduler for large-scale fields. By employing a three-stage process with the k-means clustering approach, irrigation management zones were accurately delineated to match the resolution of the irrigation equipment. This process included elevation and estimated soil hydraulic parameters as attributes, resulting in optimized management zones suitable for agro-hydrological modeling. Leveraging the universal approximation capability of neural networks, specifically long short-term memory models, this study directly modeled the dynamic behavior of root zone soil moisture content in each irrigation management zone, while accounting for the time varying nature of the rooting depth. Based on the developed data-driven models, a mixed-integer MPC framework with zone objectives was designed to determine the daily irrigation decisions and rates, aiming to enhance soil water uptake while minimizing overall water consumption and associated irrigation costs. Furthermore, a multi-agent MPC paradigm was adopted where decentralized hybrid actor–critic agents and the concept of a limiting management zone were employed to enhance the computational efficiency of the scheduler. The application of the proposed approach to a large-scale field demonstrated its capability to achieve substantial water savings and improved irrigation water use efficiency. The proposed approach also allowed for the utilization of less conservative MAD values, resulting in improved water savings and optimal crop growth. While the proposed approach shows promise, there are several modifications that can be made to further enhance its effectiveness. One priority is improving the optimality of the binding irrigation decision sequence by employing distributed techniques when training the hybrid actor–critic agents. Utilizing a hierarchy of agents that communicate with each other can result in an irrigation decision sequence that is optimal for all the management zones of the field. Additionally, this study acknowledges the potential advantages of integrating advanced time-series transformer models, as indicated in recent literature (Sitapure & Kwon, 2023). These transformer models are recognized for their proficiency in capturing complex contextual relationships, including faults, abnormalities, and parametric dependencies. While the current study employs LSTM models, considering the replacement of the LSTM approach with advanced time-series transformer models is considered a promising avenue for enhancing predictive capabilities in irrigation scheduling. Furthermore, to enhance the overall robustness of the scheduler, it is advisable to implement it alongside a lower-level controller. This controller’s task would be to track the prescriptions made by the proposed scheduler on an hourly basis. By integrating these components, the scheduler can adapt and respond in real-time to deviations or unforeseen circumstances, ensuring effective irrigation management. Implementing these modifications will contribute to the continued improvement and practical application of the scheduler, making it more effective and reliable in optimizing irrigation decisions while maintaining system robustness.

The performance of this controller is compared to a proportional, integral, derivative (PID) controller and a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) controller. In this study, the QFT controller is designed for a single canal reach because it best demonstrates how a controller is designed. Previous research for this canal model provided data for comparison. For the operating conditions that are defined in this paper, the QFT controller is shown to have slightly better performance than the PID controller and better performance than the LQR controller. When the canal hydraulic roughness is increased, the QFT controller still performed better than the PID controller. Introduction Throughout the world, there is an increasing demand for fresh water. As rural, environmental, and urban demands increase, new approaches must be investigated to stretch the limited water supply. In some areas, people have limited water allocations and they have learned to conserve and achieve the greatest benefit from a limited supply. Through improved knowledge and skills, farmers with limited water supplies have improved crop yields. As farmers’ knowledge and skill improve, more timely and accurate water deliveries are required. Water supply companies and irrigation districts are also learning to conserve water through improved management methods. In some cases, water is conserved by upgrading the delivery system, while in other cases, water is conserved by automating existing canal gates (Walker and Stringam 1999). This paper discusses the design and testing of a downstream controller for a single reach (local controller). This controller is designed using a technique called quantitative feedback control theory (QFT). The controller is designed for a single reach because it serves as an example that best explains the design methods. This paper does not use the multiple reach examples defined by the ASCE test cases (Clemmens et al. 1998) because these cases are for multiple reaches in series. The QFT method is demonstrated for a canal model that is reported by Reddy (1990). This model is used because data are provided to make comparisons. A description of a QFT design for a single reach is required before a multireach design can be explained. QFT controllers can be designed to operate multiple reaches (global system or global controller) but the basic design techniques have to first be explained for a single reach. A global QFT controller will be reported in a subsequent paper. Background On the majority of canal systems, flow rates and water control depths are varied throughout the irrigation season. In addition, canal hydraulic parameters change over time. In control terms, the system is time varying. This is especially true for earthen canals because weeds grow throughout the year, embankments degrade, sediment collects in various places, and seepage changes throughout the season. Even concrete-lined canals experience changes (Rogers 1997). In addition, it is virtually impossible to determine exact canal parameters for many earthen canals. If the canal was constructed several years ago, the original design specifications may have been lost or misplaced. Even if the specifications were available, the canal system is not likely to be in the same condition as the day it was constructed. For these reasons, a control system that operates optimally must be sensitive to changes in canal system parameters and handle varied operational control-depth set points. The various automation methods that have been developed for canal automation are diverse in their design and implementation. The control methods that have been studied may be categorized into three areas: process control, heuristic control, and analytical methods. A simple mathematical model that simulates canal hydraulics may be used in process control design. However, canal hydraulics can be difficult to accurately model. This is especially true with earthen canals. Heuristic Control Heuristic methods (trial and error designs coupled with canal operations experience) were developed because of the difficulty of deriving an accurate canal model. Examples of heuristic canal controllers are the CARDD (Burt 1983), BIVAL (Chevereau and Schwartz-Benezeth 1987), and UMA (UMA Engineering Ltd. 1989) methods. Parrish (1994) proposed a method similar to the UMA and CARDD methods. Analytical Control Analytical methods develop control algorithms based on hydraulic equations. Technically, the analytical methods described by Wylie (1969), Falvey and Luning (1979), and Liu et al. (1992) are feed-forward methods. Even though this paper describes a downstream feedback controller, the feed forward control method is mentioned because the desired outcome is to control a downstream water level. Process Control Methods Several process control methods have been developed over the past 50 years. The most prevalent and successful is proportional, integral, derivative (PID) control. This method is a subclass of the frequency design control method (Dorf 1992; Phillips and Harbor 1991; and Stephanopoulos 1984). PID control has demonstrated a great degree of robustness in many applications. It is used extensively in industrial applications because of its robust nature. The Laplace form (Phillips and Harbor 1991) of this control equation is shown below G ( s ) = K d s 2 + K p s + K i s (1) where G ( s ) represents the controller or compensator transfer function; K p = proportional gain; K i = integral gain; K d = derivative gain; and s = Laplace operator term. A control algorithm may include all three components or some of these components. The majority of downstream controllers do not use the derivative component because it is hard to tune for long time delays. This controller can be designed/tuned using a system model equation and frequency design techniques. A controller can also be developed using an empirical design method such as the Ziegler-Nichols tuning method (Stephanopoulos 1984). El-Flo (Ploss 1987) used a simplified form of the PID controller where the derivative component is not used, but the proportional component and, to some extent, the integral component are used. Wahlin and Clemmens (2002) also used a proportional integral (PI) controller to operate a series of canal reaches. The PI controller was tuned by trial and error for one reach, then an additional reach was added to the system and the system was retuned. Wahlin (2004) developed a downstream controller with a feed-forward component. Litrico and Fromion (2006) used an analytical design method to develop a downstream PI controller. The PID equation has an additional “ s ” term [Eq. (1)] in the numerator, indicating that there is an excess of zeros (numerator roots) over poles (denominator roots). Thus, there is a potential for instability. A stable controller design will have equal poles and zeros or more poles than zeros. This makes tuning or selecting gains very important because poorly selected gains can create a controller that has ranges of instability. Often, systems exhibit varied responses throughout the entire operation range and multiple gains or gain scheduling (Stephanopoulos 1984) may be needed. State-space design is another process control method that has been used to develop canal controllers (Balogun et al. 1988; Reddy 1990; Clemmens et al. 1997; Schuurmans 1997). Reddy (1990) developed a single pool controller while the other researchers focused on multireach control systems. Reddy used linear quadratic regulator (LQR) theory to design the controller for a single research. State-space methods require a reasonable system model for controller design. Defining a reasonable model is as difficult for state-space design as it is for frequency design control methods. The system model must be linearized and often simplified to determine the required control gains. In the case of a canal system, the control routine requires a linearized system for one control depth, roughness, and flow rate. If any of these parameters change significantly, a new set of gains is required to optimally control the canal gates. This problem can be dealt with using a technique called gain scheduling, but this technique can be complicated and difficult to properly program into the control code (Stephanopoulos 1984). QFT A process control method termed QFT can be used to design control algorithms for systems that have uncertain or time-varying parameters (Horowitz 1993). QFT is a frequency design control method that is used to develop a feedback controller/compensator. This design method incorporates differential, integral, and proportional control components similar to PID, but these components are balanced to insure stability. This method was developed with the understanding that it is impossible to develop a mathematical relationship that exactly models a real system. This design method can be used to design a canal controller, but the variability in canal parameters must be determined for the entire operational range. These parameters are then used to construct a design region/boundary on a Nichols chart (Horowitz 1993). If the designer does not cross this boundary, the controller is guaranteed to be stable through the entire operation range. System Model QFT requires a system model or extensive testing to determine the design boundary. Schuurmans (1997) conducted extensive research to develop a simplified process model that can be used for canal controller design. The model is simpler than the St. Venant equations and takes the following form: P u ( s ) = e − T s A s (2) where P u ( s ) = variable that represents the “plant” or in this case the canal; e − T s = time -delay function; T = time delay (s); A = surface area of the backwater curve ( m 2 ) ; and s = Laplace operator. Schuurmans et al. (1999) described how values can be determined for A and T . Canal Model The canal dimensions that are used to design a downstream controller were taken from Reddy (1990). Reddy used a state-space method to design a local downstream controller. The canal has a length of 5,000 m, a longitudinal channel slope of 0.0003, a side slope of 1.0, a bottom width of 1.70 m, a Manning roughness of 0.016, an upstream reservoir elevation of 103.2 m, a downstream reservoir elevation of 101.14 m, an upstream canal invert of 102 m, a downstream canal invert of 99.94 m, and a downstream target depth of 1.2 m. The canal model is initially operated with a constant flow rate of 3.02 m 3 / s . The turnout flow at the end of this canal is 2.50 m 3 / s and the flow at the end of the canal is 0.52 m 3 / s . QFT Controller Design While QFT can be used to design a global control system, the design of a local controller must first be understood. The remainder of this paper will describe the design of a local downstream controller for a single canal reach. A nonlinear model that numerically solves the St. Venant equations (Stringam 1998) was used to develop model parameters for A and T . The values were determined using a method described by Schuurmans (1997). Values ranging from 9,197 to 9,290 m 2 were obtained for A and 1,200–1,300 s for T . These values where inserted into Eq. (2) and the frequency response of each equation was plotted on a Bode plot (Fig. 1). From the values for area and time, crossover frequencies of 1.01 × 10 − 5 and 9.09 × 10 − 6 rad / s were measured on a Bode plot (Fig. 1). Fig. 1. Bode plot for A = 9 , 120 m 2 and T = 1 , 300 s This plot is obtained by placing a range of frequencies into the model equation and the resulting values are placed on the Bode plot. The point where the plot of the system equation model crosses over the 0-dB line on the Bode plot is termed the crossover frequency (Dorf 1992). This is a critical point because this is where the closed loop canal model is likely to pass from an unstable condition to a stable one. The values for A , T , and a crossover frequency of 1.01 × 10 − 5 rad / s were used to calculate phase values ranging from −90.752° to −90.694° and magnitude values from 20.55 to 20.64 dB. These values are determined by first converting the “ s ” term of Eq. (2) into corresponding imaginary and frequency components P ( j ω ) = e − j ω T A j ω (3) where j = imaginary number and ω = crossover frequency in rad/s. This equation can be broken up into magnitude and phase components as follows: | P ( j ω ) | = 1 A ω ; ∠ P ( j ω ) = ( − ω T − π / 2 ) (4) One of the magnitude values was generated as follows: | P ( j ω ) | = 1 A ω = 1 9197 ⋅ 1.01 × 10 − 5 = 10.765 (5) This value is converted to dB in order to locate a point on the Nichols chart (Fig. 2) 20 ⋅ log ( 10.765 ) = 20.64 dB (6) The corresponding phase angle is determined through the following relationship: ∠ P ( j ω ) = ( − ω T − π / 2 ) = ( − 1.01 × 10 − 5 ⋅ 1200 − π / 2 ) = − 1.58 rads / s (7) The value is converted to degrees by performing the following operation: − 1.58 rads / s ( 180 π ) = − 90.692 ° (8) A detailed explanation of how these values are determined can be found in Houpis and Rasmussen (1999). The angles and magnitudes are used to define corners of a design template (Fig. 2). The values for magnitude and phase that were generated for the values of A and T are shown in Table 1. Once the values for all four corners are determined, a template can be plotted as shown in Fig. 2. This template defines a region of uncertainty because the canal parameters cannot be defined exactly. If the true canal parameters were known and the parameters did not vary, the template would be defined by a dot and not an area. All of the numbers that have been determined so far have been for a frequency of 1.01 × 10 − 5 rad / s . These are the numbers that are used to design the template in Fig. 2. A template was also constructed for the 9.09 × 10 − 6 rad / s frequency, but it was smaller than the template in Fig. 2. The worst-case scenario occurs for a frequency of 1.01 × 10 − 5 rad / s . Controller design is continued for the 1.01 × 10 − 5 rad / s frequency because this is the worst case and will help to develop a more robust design. Fig. 2. Nichols plot showing system or “plant” template. The template is small for this example so it is magnified to show the template shape. Table 1. Magnitude and Phase Angles That Were Generated Using a Crossover Frequency of 1.01 × 10 − 5 rad / s ; These Values Were Used to Construct a Template Backwater curve surface area ( m 2 ) Delay time(s) Magnitude(dB) Phase 9,197 1,200 20.64 −90.694° 9,197 1,300 20.64 −90.752° 9,290 1,200 20.55 −90.694° 9,290 1,300 20.55 −90.752° Once the template is constructed, it can be moved to the 3 dB contour. This template is then slid around the 3 dB contour (Houpis and Rasmussen 1999) on a Nichols chart (Fig. 3). The template has been duplicated at several positions around the 3-dB contour to illustrate how the template is slid around the contour. The template is also smaller in Fig. 3 because the scale of the chart has changed. The 3-dB contour is used because Horowitz (1993) has determined that if the system model plus the feedback controller can operate outside this contour, the system will be stable. The template must have the same vertical and horizontal orientations as it is moved all the way around the 3-dB contour (Fig. 3). As the template is slid around the 3-dB contour, a point of the template boundary should always touch the 3-dB contour, but the template cannot cross the contour. The contour is drawn by placing a pen in the corner of the template and tracing a boundary line. The corner in this design corresponds to a value of 1,300 s for T and 9 , 290 m 2 for A or the corresponding 20.55 dB and −90.752°. This point is at the lower left corner of the template. This corner is selected for convenience and ease of plotting, but any other corner could be selected provided the template does not cross the 3 dB boundary. By using the template in this manner, the variability of system parameters is taken into account in the resulting boundary. This boundary is called the “U-contour.” The right side of the U contour follows the 3-dB contour because the point of the pen and the corner of the template touch the contour. As the template is slid around the 3-dB contour, the template boundary forces the pen away from the 3-db contour on the bottom and to the left of the diagram. The U contour that is constructed with this template accounts for the variability in crossover frequency and the variability in A and T . If these parameters were exactly known, the U contour would be traced on the 3 dB contour. It should be noted that in most QFT designs, the U contour is shaped like the letter U. However, in this design, the shape is more oval in shape. Fig. 3. Nichols plot showing the U contour drawn using the system template. The template is drawn in multiple points around the 3-dB contour to demonstrate how it is slide around the contour without crossing the contour. Once the contour has been traced, the uncompensated system response is plotted on the Nichols chart (Fig. 4). Uncompensated means that there is no feedback controller that is trying to influence or change the system response. This plot is determined by entering multiple frequencies into to the model and measuring the change in phase and magnitude outputs from the model. These values are generated using Eqs. (5) - (8) for each frequency input. As the values are determined, they are plotted on the Nichols chart. The plot of the uncompensated model shows that it must be pulled closer to the U-contour. If plot of the model response can be pulled closer to the contour, it means that the model will respond faster to control changes. This is accomplished by adding an “ s ” term to the denominator of the system compensator (adding lag). This pulls the system to the left and closer to the U contour. The 75-dB point is selected as an appropriate place to start. This point is selected because it provides ample opportunity to pull the system response plot to the left and closer to the contour. The 75-dB point has a corresponding frequency of 2 × 10 − 8 rad / s . This frequency is determined by locating the 75-dB point on the Bode plot in Fig. 1 and finding the corresponding frequency for that point. The inverse of this frequency is determined to be 5 × 10 7 . This value is placed in the denominator (adding lag) of the controller/compensator equation G ( s ) = 1 5 × 10 7 s + 1 (9) The result is plotted as the dashed line (canal model with lag) in Fig. 4. This plot shows that the additional lag is forcing the system through the U contour. The goal of this design is to force the canal model close to the U contour without crossing the contour boundaries. As the design progresses, the canal model plus the compensator response will be forced around the right side of the U contour. The Nichols chart shows that the U contour reaches a maximum point on the right side of about −135°. The plot of the system response should be forced to the right to about −135° to obtain a good design. Fig. 4. Nichols chart showing the U contour and the system response with various compensator design stages If an s term is added to the numerator (adding lead) of the compensator, the system is pulled to the right. By studying the plot of the canal model with lag in Fig. 4, it was determined that the system response curve can be pulled to the right if lead is added in the −100- to −105-dB range. This range is used because this is where the plot of the system response curve bends more drastically to the left. In order to continue with this design, the −102-dB point is selected. The Bode plot of the canal model with lag in Fig. 5 indicates that a frequency of 5.4 × 10 − 4 rad / s corresponds to the −102-dB value. The resulting compensator equation is G ( s ) = 1 , 852 s + 1 5 × 10 7 s + 1 (10) The canal model plus the lead and lag compensator response is plotted as a dotted line in Fig. 4. The plot shows that it is not far enough to the right because the bend in the curve does not reach to the −135° point. Additional lead needs to be added to the compensator. The bend in the plot of the canal model with lead and lag in Fig. 4 is the best region to determine a value for additional lead. This region starts at about −110 dB and ends at about −125 dB. Selecting a frequency for the −110-dB point would pull the system response to the right, but it would be pulled too far to the right. The −115-dB value is selected with a corresponding frequency of 7.0 × 10 − 4 rad / s . This frequency is again determined by creating a Bode plot of the canal model with the lead and lag compensator and finding the frequency that corresponds to the −115-dB point. This plot has been omitted because it is similar to Fig. 5 and the procedure is the same for all Bode plots. Lead is added to the compensator and the resulting equation is G ( s ) = 2.65 × 10 6 s 2 + 3 , 281 s + 1 5 × 10 7 s + 1 (11) The result is the plot of the dot-dashed line (additional lead added to the model and compensator). A gain must be added to the canal model and compensator to push the response up to the U contour. This is accomplished by adding a gain of 900,000 to the compensator. The value was determined by measuring the difference in dB between the bottom of the U contour and the horizontal portion of the plot of the compensator with additional lead line in Fig. 4. This difference was determined to be 119 dB. If Eq. (6) is solved backward, the following value is determined: gain = 10 119 / 20 ≈ 900 , 000 (12) Fig. 6 shows the plot of the system response with the compensator. More “zeros” and “poles” could be added to push the response closer to the U contour, but this paper focuses on the design process, which has been sufficiently demonstrated at this point. Presently, the compensator has an excess of “zeros” over “poles” and a system instability may exist. This is corrected by added lag at a frequency of 1.0 × 10 − 2 rad / s . This balances the poles and the zeros and helps make the compensator more stable. The addition of this pole has a small effect on the system and the resulting plot follows the same line as the previous compensator. Fig. 5. Bode plot for the canal model and the initial compensator of G ( s ) = 1 / ( 5 × 10 7 s + 1 ) . A frequency of 5.4 × 10 − 4 rads / s is read from the magnitude plot at about −102 dB. Fig. 6. Nichols plot showing the system response with the compensator in relationship to the U contour The resulting compensator in Laplace form is presented below: G ( s ) = 2.38 × 10 12 s 2 + 2.95 × 10 9 s + 9.0 × 10 5 5 × 10 9 s 2 + 5 × 10 7 s + 1 (13) The system model and compensator cross the U-contour, but this line is still close to the outside of the contour. In some cases, there may be a concern with this type of design, but test results below indicate that the compensator accomplishes the desired response. The Laplace form of this equation is hard to implement in a feedback control computer program. The equation must be converted to a digital form. If a control interval of 1 min is used, the compensator equation takes the following form: Δ q k = 1.549 Δ q k − 1 − 0.5488 Δ q k − 2 + 47.17 e k − 91.68 e k − 1 + 44.56 e k − 2 (14) where Δ q k represents the flow rate change; Δ q k − 1 represents the last flow rate change; Δ q k − 2 represents the flow rate change prior to the last flow rate change; e k = difference between the water level set point and the present water level; e k − 1 is the last error that was measured between the set point and the water level; and e k − 2 = error that was measured prior to the last error. The method that is used to convert the Laplace compensator equation to the digital compensator equation can be found in Dorf (1992). The above equation is in the form that could be implemented in a computer control unit that is located at the canal gate control site. The equation indicates that the last two gate flow rate changes and the last two errors would have to be remembered in order to compute the required flow change. As indicated earlier, the control interval was 1 min, however, a control engineer may select an interval of 5 or 10 min. If this were true, the gains that are indicated in Eq. (13) would change. The controller/compensator has been designed considering the variations of the canal parameters. If all variations in system parameters are accounted for in the original template, the resulting controller will be stable. This is true even if the system parameters change, provided that the variations were accounted for in the original template. Results The previously designed QFT controller was tested on a nonlinear model (Stringam 1998) with the dimensions defined by Reddy (1990). Considering that the goal of designing a compensator is to control a canal, a nonlinear model that solves the St. Venant equations would give a more realistic response. A PID controller was also designed to control this nonlinear model using the Ziegler-Nichols tuning method (Stephanopoulos 1984). The PID controller is used for comparison because there are differential, integral, and proportional components contained within the QFT compensator design. The results from these two controllers were compared to one of the tests for the LQR controller reported by Reddy (1990) where an additional flow rate of 0.25 m 3 / s is taken at the downstream end of the reach. This would tend to bias the results toward the LQR controller because it was tested on a linear model. The results of all three controllers can be observed in Fig. 7. This graph shows the resulting downstream depths when the outflow is increased. Fig. 7. Plot of the downstream depth for the QFT, PID, and LQR controllers. A flow rate of 0.25 m 3 / s is taken at the downstream end of the reach. The graph of the response of all three methods indicates that the PID method and the QFT method have similar responses. It may be difficult to argue that one method is better than the other, except that the QFT method has less overshoot and settles into the set point sooner. Fig. 7 indicates that the LQR controller does not bring the system back to the set point as quickly as the PID and QFT methods. In addition, after the system reaches its minimum, the LQR controller has a slower initial rate of recovery than the other two controllers. A final test was conducted by changing the channel roughness from 0.016 to 0.019. All the other parameters, which were previously defined, were kept the same. The demand at the downstream end of the reach was increased an additional 0.25 m 3 / s . Fig. 8 shows that the PID controller had more of an oscillatory response than the QFT controller. Though the QFT method had more overshoot than the previous test, it was less than the PID method. The QFT controller again settled into the set point sooner. Fig. 8. Plot of the downstream depth for the QFT and PID controllers. An additional flow rate of 0.25 m 3 / s is taken at the downstream end of the reach. The canal roughness has been increased to 0.019. Conclusions It could be argued that there is little advantage of a QFT controller over a PID controller. The results of this paper indicate that both methods have similar responses. However, there are several factors that should be considered before drawing this conclusion. First, the PID controller equation has an excess of s terms in the numerator. This means that there is the possibility of instability in the control system. Experienced control engineers and technicians will often say that they have had instances where seemingly stable PID controllers suddenly became unstable and the controller had to be shut down before there were disastrous results (Phillips and Harbor 1991). An additional concern is the fact that PID controllers have narrower operational ranges than QFT controllers. This can be corrected with gain scheduling (Stephanopoulos 1984), but this makes the controller code more complicated than QFT controller code. As mentioned previously, canals are operated at different levels, weeds grow in the canal, silt collects, and seepage changes throughout the irrigation season. A QFT controller can be designed with a wider operation range to account for these changes. This wider range was demonstrated in Fig. 8. When the results from the PID and QFT controller were compared to the LQR controller, they performed better than the LQR method. In this case, the LQR controller had a slower response than the PID and QFT controllers. The final and most important reason for considering QFT is that it can be applied to global control systems. A controller for a canal system seldom functions well if it is made up of several local controllers. On the other hand, a global controller will minimize the interference that the different reaches have on each other and arrive at the control solution that will best operate the entire system. A global QFT controller will be reported in a subsequent paper. References Balogun, O. S., Hubbard, M., and DeVries, J. J.

  Main Objective: To evaluate the current state and future potential of end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate Internet of Things (IoT) and machine learning technologies, with a focus on exploring automation across the entire pipeline, emphasizing interoperability and standardization, identifying challenges, and proposing solutions.
  Study Location: Unspecified
  Data Sources: Weather data, soil data, plant data
  Technologies Used: Model Predictive Control (MPC), VARIwise simulation framework, cotton crop model OZCOT
  Key Findings: - Model-based control strategies potentially avoid the limitations of sensor-based irrigation strategies by using a crop and/or soil production model to make decisions on water application and/or timing.

- The MPC strategy was successfully implemented in VARIwise and performed well in controlling an automatic irrigation machine applying spatially-varied irrigation amounts in simulated cotton crop scenarios.

- The MPC strategy can be used to optimize crop yield, crop water use efficiency, or irrigation water use efficiency, as appropriate, based on the user-specified objective.

- The MPC strategy produced significantly higher yield and crop water use efficiency than sensor-based strategies for the same simulated field conditions, but required more comprehensive data input for accurate crop model calibration.
  Extract 1: "Model-based control strategies applied to irrigation make decisions (on water application and/or timing) using a crop and/or soil production model. Decisions are made with respect to an optimisation objective which, for irrigation, can be either short-term (e.g. achieving/maintaining a set soil–water deficit) or predicted end-of-season (e.g. maximising final yield) by predicting how the crop will respond at the end of the season. In contrast, sensor-based irrigation strategies rely on achieving a performance that is measurable during the crop season to provide the feedback control, and may not necessarily optimise overall crop performance. Model-based control potentially avoids this limitation."
  Extract 2: "For the example of cotton grown in Australia, presents results for a range of simulations having different performance objectives. The results are presented as three case studies, A, B and C, which, in order, evaluate the potential of MPC to optimise: A. short-term responses of square count or soil–water; B. predicted end-of-season crop yield or water use efficiency with (i) low and high soil nitrogen content, and (ii) crop seasons with and without rainfall; and C. predicted end-of-season crop yield with different combinations of sensory input data to calibrate the model. A comparison is then made between the MPC strategies and simulations of ‘sensor-based’ strategies for adaptive irrigation control (McCarthy et al., 2014)."
  Limitations: None
  Relevance Evaluation: This paper is highly relevant to the point I am making in my literature review. The paper presents a novel Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy for optimizing irrigation water use and yield, which aligns with the focus on enhancing system reliability, using control techniques, and exploring automation across the irrigation pipeline.

Abstract Model-based control strategies applied to irrigation make decisions (on water application and/or timing) using a crop and/or soil production model. Decisions are made with respect to an optimisation objective which, for irrigation, can be either short-term (e.g. achieving/maintaining a set soil–water deficit) or predicted end-of-season (e.g. maximising final yield) by predicting how the crop will respond at the end of the season. In contrast, sensor-based irrigation strategies rely on achieving a performance that is measurable during the crop season to provide the feedback control, and may not necessarily optimise overall crop performance. Model-based control potentially avoids this limitation. This paper describes the application of Model Predictive Control (MPC) methodology to the feedback control of irrigation via a model-based irrigation strategy implemented in the irrigation control simulation framework ‘VARIwise’. The requirement to also accommodate spatial and temporal differences in crop water requirement across a heterogeneous field is met by defining management ‘zones’ according to differing soil and crop properties across the field and separately applying the control algorithm for each of these zones. Case studies were conducted to evaluate MPC for a centre pivot irrigation machine-irrigated cotton crop (under typical Australian growing conditions) with: (i) different in-season performance objectives (maintaining soil–water deficit; maximising square count); (ii) different predicted end-of-season performance objectives (maximising yield; maximising water use efficiency); and (iii) maximising yield with different field data inputs for model calibration. The Model Predictive Control strategy produced significantly higher simulated yields and water use efficiency than an industry-standard irrigation management strategy; and (in most but not all situations) direct sensor-based adaptive control strategies.

Introduction The development of the control simulation framework ‘VARIwise’ has enabled the evaluation of site-specific, spatially-variable irrigation control strategies on field crops (McCarthy et al., 2010a). VARIwise permits spatially and temporally varied simulation and accommodates sub-field scale variations in all input parameters down to metre-scale zone size. Simulations of ‘sensor-based’ strategies showed potential improvements in yield and water use efficiency (McCarthy et al., 2014). These strategies compared the field measurements with a desired response (e.g. soil–water deficit) and adjusted the irrigation volume applied according to the difference. 1.1. Model Predictive Control (MPC) applied to irrigation In contrast, an alternative ‘advanced process control’ approach to irrigation uses crop production models to aid the irrigation decision making process. These ‘model-based’ control strategies use the available field measurements to calibrate the crop model. The model is then repeatedly executed to determine the optimal irrigation volume and timing that will achieve the desired performance objective (e.g. predicted end-of-season yield). The methodology of Model Predictive Control (MPC) involves using a model to predict the optimal input signal at the current time considering future events over a finite time period (Kwon and Han, 2005). This is referred to as a ‘control horizon length’. Only the first optimal control action is implemented after each time step. MPC is applicable to irrigation since a soil-plant-atmosphere model may be used to evaluate the application of various irrigation volumes on a fixed number of consecutive days. For example, the model may be used to, firstly, determine the best irrigation volume to apply on each zone for each of the next three days; and, secondly, determine which day resulted in the best overall performance. The future process outputs used to evaluate the irrigation scheme may be predicted daily with measurements of crop response (e.g. for cotton, square/boll count, leaf area index) or soil–water. Alternatively, the simulated final crop yield or water use efficiency may be used to evaluate the various irrigation schemes. From the control perspective, the ‘process model’ evolves during the growth of the crop such that the control must be adaptive. This requirement means that the model used by the MPC strategy must be continuously re-calibrated using the currently available field data. The plant growth and soil–water dynamics in the cotton model OZCOT (Wells and Hearn, 1992) implemented within VARIwise, can be accurately calibrated (McCarthy et al., 2011). The calibrated OZCOT model has also been found to accurately simulate yield (Richards et al., 2001). Using one season’s field experiment data McCarthy et al. (2011) found that OZCOT was most effectively calibrated (and therefore able to predict the soil and crop response to irrigation application) using full data input, whilst for situations where only two data inputs were available, the simulations suggested that either weather-and-plant or soil-and-plant inputs were preferable. Park et al. (2009) developed two MPC systems for centre pivot irrigation which both used measured soil and weather inputs to calibrate a soil–water model. Their first implementation used the calibrated model to determine the irrigation volumes which would fill the soil profile for irrigation events on fixed days; whereas their second implementation used the calibrated model to determine the irrigation timing for a fixed irrigation volume application which would fill the soil profile. Neither implementation incorporated the crop growth response. 1.2. MPC and crop production models The performance objectives set for MPC applied to irrigation can range from a short-term objective such as achieving a preset soil–water deficit following each irrigation to a ‘whole season’ objective such as maximising predicted end-of-season yield. In addition, crop production models (such as OZCOT for cotton, discussed below) have sophisticated prediction capabilities which may be utilised in the implementation of MPC. For example, a performance objective to maximise the number of plant fruiting sites during growth should maximise potential predicted end-of-season yield. This additional crop response capability typically requires measurements of the plant to calibrate the crop production model according to the measured plant growth parameters (e.g. fruiting), which in turn requires infield plant sensors to provide calibration data. To maximise uptake of the site-specific irrigation control system by growers it is desirable to minimise the sensor requirements. A reduction in measurements could be achieved by using only the data types that are more influential in the model calibration or by reducing the spatial or temporal resolution of data. However, the data used to calibrate the model should still enable sufficient accuracy of the model. An insufficient range of measurements to calibrate the model used by MPC will influence the accuracy of the model and the model’s ability to predict irrigation and crop performance. Hence, this paper aims to: • identify the optimal combination of performance objective and data input combination amenable to practical MPC strategies; and also • explore the impact of different control horizon lengths (period of time for forecasting future events) on the performance of MPC. The strategies simulated in this paper explore the viability of the use of MPC in the simulation of a ‘realistic’ irrigation situation with spatial and temporal variation across a heterogeneous field. Accordingly, this paper details the implementation of the MPC methodology in VARIwise and, for the example of cotton grown in Australia, presents results for a range of simulations having different performance objectives. The results are presented as three case studies, A, B and C, which, in order, evaluate the potential of MPC to optimise: A. short-term responses of square count or soil–water; B. predicted end-of-season crop yield or water use efficiency with (i) low and high soil nitrogen content, and (ii) crop seasons with and without rainfall; and C. predicted end-of-season crop yield with different combinations of sensory input data to calibrate the model. A comparison is then made between the MPC strategies and simulations of ‘sensor-based’ strategies for adaptive irrigation control (McCarthy et al., 2014). 2. Implementation The simulation framework ‘VARIwise’ (McCarthy et al., 2010a) was created to develop, simulate and evaluate site-specific irrigation control strategies for centre pivot and lateral move irrigation machines on non-uniform (spatially and temporally varied) fields. The framework enables evaluation of strategies with different sensor data availability (both spatial and temporal); for example, the performance of the control strategies with spatial gaps in measured response is explored in McCarthy et al. (2010b). In addition, the framework can provide evaluation of different irrigation system capacity constraints and when supplied with real-time weather and/or other field data, the framework will provide direct machine actuation. For the simulation (and management) of cotton irrigation, the cotton production model OZCOT (Wells and Hearn, 1992) was used by VARIwise and was automatically and continuously calibrated according to the currently available weather, soil and plant data. Details are set out in McCarthy et al. (2011). To illustrate the VARIwise configuration used to evaluate MPC a general schematic is presented in Fig. 1, in which the central blocks and data flows are explained in the following sections. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. The simulation framework VARIwise configured to evaluate (in simulation mode) the model-based adaptive control strategy Model Predictive Control (MPC). In this mode, the block ‘AcModel’ (also an OZCOT formulation) has replaced the field data measurements which would normally update ‘RefModel’. (This diagram is adapted from the full VARIwise flowchart presented as Fig. 2 of McCarthy et al., 2010a, McCarthy et al., 2010b). The MPC algorithm predicts how much each output (e.g. soil–water, fruit load) will deviate from a time series trajectory within the prediction horizon. A MPC cost function J(k) is calculated for each possible set of input actions in the current time step k using a least squares algorithm of the following form (Maciejowski, 2002): (1) where J(k) is the cost function at instant k, C the length of prediction/control horizon, N the number of system outputs, wj the weighting coefficient for output j, rj(k + i) the predicted value of jth output at future instant k + i, and xj(k + i) is the target value of jth output at future instant k + i. The control action that minimises the cost function (i.e. that produces the smallest deviation in performance from the desired trajectory) is implemented. This optimisation is repeated at each sample time step to update the optimal input trajectory after a feedback update. Hence, this MPC algorithm calculates the sequence of control action adjustments over a specified future time interval. In an irrigation context, the system outputs used to calculate the cost function will typically have different units and magnitudes, and the same percentage change in variables of different units and magnitudes may cause unintentional bias toward variables that are generally larger in magnitude. For example, a particular percentage difference in soil–water will produce a larger cost function than the same percentage difference in leaf area index. Hence, the MPC algorithm was modified (Eq. (2)) to calculate a performance index that represents a percentage difference in the predicted outputs rather than a least squares objective function (Eq. (1)). The control action that maximises the performance index PI(k) is then implemented in each time step, and is calculated using the equation: (2) The MPC methodology was implemented to determine irrigation timing and site-specific irrigation volumes on a daily basis by means of the following four-step procedure: 1. Update measured and forecast weather data. 2. Calibrate crop model. 3. Optimise irrigation volume for each zone. 4. Optimise day of next irrigation. The details of each step in relation to the following case studies are set out below. This procedure is independently applied to each ‘management zone’, where each zone in the field is defined according to differing soil and crop properties across the heterogeneous field. 2.1. Step 1: updating measured and forecast weather data For each day of the crop season, the meteorological data input file for the integrated crop model was updated to include the previous day’s weather and the updated weather forecast for the farm’s location. In a field implementation of MPC, the ‘previous day’s weather’ could be obtained from an on-site weather station and the ‘updated weather forecast’ could be obtained from the Bureau of Meteorology. However, to simulate the performance of MPC for a whole season (where there was no field implementation) both ‘previous day’s weather’ and ‘updated weather forecast’ had to be obtained from historical data. Because of the high variability of Australian climate and the difficulty in picking a ‘typical’ year, an artificial daily meteorological dataset was created by averaging the day-to-day data of the five years (1999–2004 inclusive) appropriate to the location of Dalby (Latitude −28.18°N, Longitude 151.26° E), a major cotton-growing region of south-east Queensland, Australia, and this dataset was used for all simulations. Daily data comprised maximum and minimum temperature, solar radiation and rainfall, and was sourced from Australian Bureau of Meteorology SILO patched point environmental dataset (QNRM, 2009). SILO is an enhanced climate database containing Australian climate data from 1889. Forecast weather data, to be used predictively during the simulations, was created by imposing a Gaussian distribution of variability on the daily values of the five-year-averaged dataset using standard deviations of ±5 °C, ±5 °C, ±5 W h/m2 and ±50% for maximum temperature, minimum temperature, daily solar radiation and rainfall, respectively; i.e. for any given day, the forecast one, two and three days ahead, then values for each variable randomly generated within each distribution by taking that day’s values as the mean. For each day, only three days of the forecast weather data were used. This is because the two Australian short-term numerical weather prediction models forecast three and seven days ahead and are combined to improve the prediction accuracy (Ebert, 2001). The three-day forecast would be more accurate than one model on its own because both models could predict weather to three days. A three-day forecast would ensure short-term prediction accuracy in the predictions, particularly as regards rainfall in south-east Queensland, Australia, where the summer rainfall is dominated by frontal bands of isolated cumulo-nimbus storms. 2.2. Step 2: calibrating the crop model – ‘actual’ and ‘reference’ models The crop model OZCOT is utilised by VARIwise and can be automatically and continuously calibrated according to the ‘currently’ available weather, plus soil and plant data, using the procedure set out in McCarthy et al. (2011). The procedure for calibrating the production/growth model OZCOT in a real-time implementation, i.e. for actual irrigation machine control, involves automatically and iteratively adjusting the parameters used to predict soil water status and plant growth until the difference between the predicted and sensed variables reached a minimum. For the cotton model OZCOT, the plant variables (leaf area index, boll count, square count), soil variables (soil moisture content and plant available water capacity) and weather variables (daily minimum and maximum temperature, rainfall and solar radiation in weather input file) are interdependent. The plant behaviour can be calibrated by adjusting parameters in a crop properties file, whilst the soil moisture behaviour was calibrated by adjusting parameters in a soil properties file. These parameters were adjusted between the minimum and maximum values of the corresponding parameters in the predefined soil properties and crop variety parameter profiles. The parameters adjusted in the crop properties file included squaring rate (the rate of new flower buds being produced), growth rate of leaf area and plant population constant; whilst the parameters adjusted in the soil properties file were the initial soil moisture content and drained upper limit in each soil layer. A ‘reference’ model, labelled ‘RefModel’, is used to provide the crop growth prediction scenario for MPC. However, for the present case studies there was no measured field data input to calibrate the model. To overcome this, a second OZCOT model of the cotton crop was used in place of ‘actual’ field conditions. This model is referred to as the ‘actual crop’ model, labelled ‘AcModel’ and the parameters were different to those in RefModel to emulate RefModel not exactly following the field conditions. In a field implementation the AcModel is not required as field measurements would be used. AcModel was then used to calibrate RefModel (Fig. 1). The crop and soil properties of AcModel were obtained from the user-specified soil and plant measurements (and these varied between simulations, as set out below). Within RefModel the crop variety was specified by the user at commencement. Likewise the soil properties of RefModel were user-specified, with the addition of areal variation in available soil–water imposed via a Gaussian distribution of variability having a standard deviation of ±25 mm (water depth equivalent). 2.3. Step 3: optimising irrigation volumes for each zone Optimal irrigation volumes were determined by iteratively simulating the daily application of sixteen different irrigation volumes at 1 mm increments between 0 and 15 mm on each zone in the field. For each irrigation volume applied (for management zone k), a performance index PI(k) was calculated using Eq. (2). For variables that are maximised to achieve the optimal irrigation strategy (e.g. square count, yield, crop water use efficiency), the target value is taken to be the maximum realistic commercially attainable value (e.g. 15 bales/ha for cotton yield, 3 bales/ML for crop water use efficiency). The predicted process outputs used to calculate the PI were taken one day after the irrigation application. The optimal irrigation volume for each zone was the irrigation volume with the highest PI; however, if more than one irrigation volume had the same PI then a water-efficient approach was taken and the optimal irrigation volume was the lowest quantitative volume that achieved the maximum PI. The irrigation volume was then calculated for each zone in the order in which the irrigation machine was to pass over the field. 2.4. Step 4: optimising the timing (day) of the next irrigation The optimal day for the next irrigation event was determined using the calibrated RefModel. This involved performing the irrigation volume optimisation of the previous step for an arbitrary number of days (i.e. to a fixed horizon) and contained the assumption that the irrigation event could occur on only one of the days. The maximum horizon length was set to three days since three days of predictive weather were used. The sixteen irrigation volumes tested on each zone depend on the irrigation day being tested. This is because, unless rainfall occurs, it was assumed that the crop water requirement (and hence irrigation application volume) increases for each day the irrigation event is delayed. For the first day irrigation volumes of 0–15 mm were tested with increments of 1 mm; for the second day 0–31 mm were tested with increments of 2 mm; and for the third day 0–47 mm were tested with increments of 3 mm. A PI is calculated for each irrigation day by summing the individual PI values for each zone. The day with the highest total PI is taken to be the optimal day for the next irrigation event. The irrigation event is scheduled if the first day in the horizon had the highest PI and there are a minimum number of zones requiring irrigation greater than 0 mm. This ensures that the irrigation application is practical and irrigations are not initiated for only a small number of zones in the field. The threshold, i.e. the minimum proportion of zones requiring irrigation, was arbitrarily selected to be 15% for the case studies presented. 2.5. Subsequent iteration After the optimal irrigation action – which may, of course, be a ‘nil irrigation’ action – was determined for the user-specified first day, the procedure described in the four subsections above was repeated every day throughout the crop season, with the irrigation events ending on a day specified by the user. 3. MPC Case Study A: optimisation of short-term responses using different combinations of daily input data The MPC strategy was evaluated with daily input data to predict and control irrigation applications to achieve either a short-term soil (e.g. deficit) or plant growth (e.g. leaf area index) target. A range of combinations of input variables for control were used to determine which input data stream was most useful for MPC. 3.1. Methodology for Case Study A The field was automatically divided into 44 zones, each of area approximately 0.3 ha, and the irrigations occurred daily. This number of zones enabled the simulations to be executed in a timely manner with spatially variable soil properties across the field. The MPC strategy was evaluated for ten combinations of data input (Table 1). The input data combinations represent the data used both as input variables to calibrate RefModel and the variables used for control. For the simulations using both soil and plant data, the weighting on each variable was set to be 0.5. The strategies with soil data input aimed for soil–water deficit equal to 10% of the plant available water capacity in each zone. Table 1.

The starting soil–water deficit map was generated by assigning a starting soil–water deficit value of 30 mm across the field and imposing a Gaussian distribution of variability with standard deviation ±10 mm on each zone. The PAWC map was generating by assigning PAWC values of 60, 150 and 200 mm on three zones of the fields, spatially interpolating the PAWC using ordinary kriging and by similarly imposing a Gaussian distribution of variability with standard deviation ±10 mm on each zone. The PAWC ranges from 60 to 200 mm in the simulated field to ensure the control strategies could deal with the different soil types that often exist within fields.

The measured crop response (AcModel) used the Sicot 73 cotton variety and soil variability map of Fig. 2. Siokra V16RR is a “Roundup Ready” late-maturing cotton variety, whilst Sicot 73 is a full season cotton variety with high yield potential (CSD, 2009). The prediction horizon was one day and it was practical for irrigation events to occur daily. 3.2. Case Study A – results and discussion Table 2 sets out the numerical results of the MPC Case Study A, whilst Fig. 3 illustrates the spatial variability of the yield for each simulation of the case study. The performance of the control strategies are compared based on the average and variability of the yield, irrigation applied, Irrigation Water Use Index (IWUI) and Crop Water Use Index (CWUI) across the zones in the field. The variability reflects differences in yield response according to spatially variable irrigation application. The strategies that use weather-soil-and-plant data to calibrate and target a fixed soil–water (simulation #19) and maximise square/boll count (simulation #20), are also compared using the simulated soil–water deficit (Fig. 4) and simulated square count (Fig. 5) throughout the crop season.

Simulated daily square count in sand, clay loam and clay zones for strategies that use weather, soil and plant data for model calibration (RefModel). Set (a): targeting fixed soil–water deficit (simulation #19); and set (b): maximising square count (simulation #20). The simulated yield and water use efficiency increased as more data streams were included in the input data combination. This is shown in Table 2 as the single-input simulations produced the lowest yields and water use efficiencies (simulations #11 and #12) while the three simulations having three data inputs (simulations #18, #19 and #20) performed better than all of the five simulations having two data inputs (simulations #13 to #17 inclusive). The data combinations with soil data and no plant data (simulations #11 and #13) resulted in higher yields than those with plant data and no soil data (simulations #12 and #14). This result suggests that if only one data input is available then soil data input is most effective for calibrating RefModel and for irrigation control. The simulations using combinations of soil and plant data input to determine the irrigation volumes (simulations #15 and #18) generally produced lower yields and water use efficiencies than those using only plant data input to determine the irrigation volumes (simulations #17 and #20) with the same data available for RefModel calibration. For example, for the strategies with soil and plant data available to calibrate RefModel, a higher yield was simulated when the strategy maximised the square/boll count (simulation #17) than when the strategy attempted to both maintain soil–water and maximise square count (simulation #15). Hence, in this case there was no obvious benefit in the using multiple variables to determine the application volumes. The MPC strategy accurately maintained the soil–water deficit threshold during low rainfall periods of the crop season for simulation #19 (63 to 85 days after sowing, Fig. 4(a)). For the MPC strategy that maximised square/boll count (simulation #20), the soil–water deficit was always higher than the soil–water deficit threshold that was approximately maintained in simulation #19 throughout the crop season (Fig. 4(b)). The soil–water deficit was also lowest in the sand zone (with the lowest plant available water capacity) and highest in the clay zone (with the highest plant available water capacity) throughout the crop season for the strategy optimising square count. This indicates that to maximise the square count, the soil–water deficit should be reduced in proportion with the plant available water capacity of the soil. The highest yield was achieved using weather-soil-and-plant input and maximising square count (simulation #20). The square count was higher throughout the crop season for this simulation compared with that for MPC maintaining soil–water deficit (simulation #19) (Fig. 5). Hence, the implemented MPC strategy successfully increased the simulated square count and improvements in yield (by 14%) and crop water use efficiency (by 30%) were observed by maximising square count instead of targeting soil–water. 4. MPC Case Study B: optimisation using a predicted end-of-season yield or water use efficiency target The MPC strategy uses RefModel to forecast the response of cotton crop with specific environmental conditions and soil and crop properties; hence, the irrigation volume/timing may be adjusted to achieve a desired predicted end-of-season output, in this case a final yield or water use efficiency. This is in contrast to Case Study A in which the MPC strategy used daily input data (e.g. square count, soil–water) to predict the best short-term response to a range of irrigation volumes. 4.1. Methodology for Case Study B The field was automatically divided into 44 zones as per the previous case study and the irrigations could occur daily. The MPC strategy was evaluated for crop seasons with and without rainfall and with two levels of initial nitrogen content (120 kg/ha and 250 kg/ha). The same weather dataset was used for both these sets of simulations; however the daily rainfall was set to zero for the simulations without rainfall. In the simulations with rainfall there was high rainfall during days 63–85 after sowing. The MPC strategy was used to optimise the predicted Irrigation Water Use Index (IWUI), Crop Water Use Index (CWUI) and yield assuming the machine capacity enabled the machine to traverse the field once every day. An algorithm maximising IWUI or CWUI may decide to apply no irrigation to minimise the irrigation volume but would also produce low yield. Hence, to ensure that the IWUI and CWUI optimisation would irrigate the crop, the minimum acceptable yield was arbitrarily set at 5 bales/ha in all optimisations. 4.2. Case Study B – results and discussion The simulation results are displayed in Table 3 and Fig. 6 and the spatially varied irrigation volumes applied are compared with different in-season rainfall and starting nitrogen content at commencement (Fig. 7 and Fig. 8, respectively).

For each set of field conditions (i.e. starting nitrogen content and in-season rainfall), the simulated yield was highest for the MPC strategy that optimised yield (simulations #21, #23, #25 and #28). Similarly, the strategies optimising IWUI (simulations #27 and #30) and CWUI (simulations #26 and #29) produced the highest respective IWUI and CWUI of the simulations with the same field conditions. This indicates that MPC strategy could adjust the irrigation application to improve either yield or water use efficiency. Increasing the starting nitrogen content significantly improved the simulated yield and water use efficiency. This is shown in Table 3 as the yield for the no-rainfall simulation with the higher nitrogen content of 250 kg N/ha (e.g. 17.9 bales/ha for simulation #23) was nearly double that of the simulation with the lower nitrogen content of 120 kg N/ha (e.g. 9.0 bales/ha for simulation #21). Since the irrigation volumes applied were similar for these two simulations (Fig. 8), the CWUI and IWUI of the higher nitrogen content simulations were also nearly double that of the lower nitrogen content simulations. Hence, nitrogen application had a significant effect on the final yield without greatly affecting the irrigation volume required to be applied. Rainfall significantly affected the simulated yield and CWUI (Table 3). Table 3 shows that the yields, irrigation applications and CWUI of simulations #21−#24 (without rainfall) are higher than those of simulations #25−#30 (with rainfall). This suggests that the crop is easier to control with less rainfall in the season. The difference in yield and CWUI is most noticeable for simulations with high nitrogen content (e.g. simulation #28 with rainfall and simulation #23 without rainfall) because the simulated yields are higher and the differences between the yields are more apparent. It follows that during the period of the crop season with high rainfall (63–86 days after sowing), lower irrigation volumes were applied compared to the periods of no rainfall (87–105 days after sowing) (Fig. 7). The rainfall did not generally affect the IWUI for the simulated set of field conditions (e.g. simulation #21 with no rainfall versus simulation #25 with rainfall). This is because more rainfall caused both the yield and irrigation application (which are used to calculate the IWUI) to decrease by approximately the same proportion. 5. MPC Case Study C: optimisation using a predicted end-of-season target, with limited calibration data The MPC simulations of the Case Study B assumed that the full data input of weather, soil and plant information was available for RefModel calibration. However, all three data streams may not be available in a field implementation. Case Study C evaluates the usefulness of different data streams to calibrate RefModel in a MPC strategy with a predicted end-of-season target. 5.1. Methodology for Case Study C The seven possible input data combinations (Table 2) were separately evaluated as input for RefModel calibration. The datasets were obtained daily from the cotton model Sicot 71B and used to calibrate the Siokra V16RR cotton model. The field and weather conditions were as used in the earlier case studies, the MPC strategy optimised yield and the irrigations occurred daily. 5.2. Case Study C – results and discussion Table 4 and Fig. 9 set out a comparison of an MPC strategy that maximises yield with different combinations of input data to calibrate RefModel. The use of more information in the input data combination generally increased the average yield and water use efficiency (Table 4). Table 4 shows that MPC performance with all three input variables (simulation #37/#28) was superior to that with any two variables (simulations #34−#36); and similarly performance with two input variables was superior to that with any single input variable alone, except plant input (simulation #33) versus soil-and-plant input (simulation #36). This suggests that the MPC calibration performs better with soil data input than plant data input. Table 4.

Yield maps and average yield and irrigation outputs of Model Predictive Control strategy with variable-rate irrigation machine and legend for yield maps, where simulation #371 is a duplication of simulation #28 for comparison (numerical data for simulations #31−#37 are in Table 4). The lowest yields and water use efficiencies were simulated with only weather data input (e.g. simulations #31). This is because the weather data (without field-specific soil or crop data) provides no information to adequately parameterise the crop model used by the MPC strategy. This could lead to insufficient model calibration and sub-optimal irrigation volumes being determined. The irrigation water use efficiency was higher using the weather and plant combination (simulation #35) than using the full data input (simulation #37/#28): this is because the yield was maximised rather than the water use efficiency in this case study. 6. General discussion A Model Predictive Control strategy was successfully implemented in VARIwise. The controller uses currently available field data to calibrate the OZCOT cotton production model and then evaluates a range of irrigation volumes and timings in each zone. The controller then implements the site-specific irrigation volumes on the day that achieves the highest water use efficiency or yield averaged over the field, as user specified. Three alternative optimisation possibilities were identified and explored, and the conclusions for each, and their comparison, are as set out below. In each case the MPC strategy performed successfully in the (simulated) task of controlling an automatic irrigation machine applying spatially-varied irrigation amounts. For convenience, Table 5 gathers together the particular simulation outputs referred to in this section. Table 5 also compares results of MPC with two sensor-based control strategies, namely Iterative Learning Controller (ILC) and Iterative Hill Climbing Controller (IHCC), simulated on fields with PAWC varying between 60 and 200 mm with 1266 zones, and the same weather profile and crop variety (as detailed in McCarthy et al., 2014). These sensor-based strategies refine the estimate of each successive irrigation volume applied by: Table 5. Control strategy simulation outputs where the initial nitrogen content is 250 kg/ha and there is rainfall during the crop season unless otherwise noted.

(2014). b Crop season has no rainfall. c Initial nitrogen content is 250 kg/ha. [ILC] – iteratively adjusting the irrigation volume applied in each zone of the field using the incremental response, i.e. the OZCOT-determined plant growth arising from the change in particular field sensor information which has resulted from the previous water application, in each zone; or [IHCC] – similarly adjusting the irrigation volumes, but based on multiple sensor increment information, using a range of irrigation volumes applied within a group of homogenous zones. The performance of the MPC strategy was also compared with an industry-standard irrigation strategy (first line of Table 5). This strategy applied a uniform irrigation treatment (25 mm) across the field and initiated irrigation events when the soil–water deficit reached a set amount (30 mm) in one point in the field (in the cell with sandy soil). The soil–water deficit was taken in the cell with the lowest plant available water capacity, as this is the most limiting soil. To ensure validity of the comparison this simulation was executed using the same weather conditions and spatially variable plant available water capacity and starting soil–water, and crop variety as the reference model. The nitrogen content was set to 250 kg/ha. The MPC strategy was evaluated with different combinations of input data (Section 3 above). The predicted yield and water use efficiency were highest when the strategy maximised the square count and calibrated the model using all three streams of data input (weather, soil and plant, simulation #20). The yield and water use efficiency were also higher than those of the industry-standard irrigation management strategy (McCarthy et al., 2014), and also ILC (simulation #1) and IHCC (simulation #9) with either weather-soil-and-plant, weather-and-soil or weather-and-plant data input available (likewise refer McCarthy et al., 2014). However, the MPC (optimising daily input data) performed worse than the ILC and IHCC where there was only either soil input (simulation #11) or weather-and-plant (simulation #14) input data available. The controller successfully adjusted the irrigation to improve the yield, CWUI or IWUI, as appropriate (Section 4). The yield was higher with high nitrogen content (e.g. simulation #28) than with low nitrogen content (simulation #25) and with no rainfall during the crop season (simulation #23) compared with high rainfall (simulation #28). This is because the control strategy could better control the water applied in response to the other environmental factors. The simulated average yields and water use efficiencies were significantly higher than the industry-standard irrigation management strategy, ILC strategy (simulation #1) and IHCC strategy (simulation #9) (McCarthy et al., 2014). MPC was evaluated with different combinations of input data available to calibrate the model (Section 5). The controller performed best with input of weather-soil-and-plant data (simulation #28), but still produced higher yields and water use efficiencies with weather-and-soil (simulation #34) or weather-and-plant (simulation #35) input than the irrigation-standard irrigation management strategy, and ILC (simulation #1) and IHCC (simulation #9) case studies (McCarthy et al., 2014). Higher yields and water use efficiencies were produced for MPC optimising predicted end-of-season data (simulation #28) than for MPC using daily input data to maximise square count (simulation #20). However, both of these control strategies required either the full data input, weather-and-soil or weather-and-plant data input to obtain yields higher than the ILC or IHCC strategies. 7. Conclusion The Model Predictive Control strategy implemented in the control simulation software VARIwise performed successfully in the task of controlling an automatic irrigation machine applying water to a simulated cotton crop grown in typical conditions for south-east Queensland, Australia. In all simulations the MPC strategy specified ‘sensible’ irrigation amounts typical of irrigation practice in this region. Simulations using the MPC strategy indicated that the MPC strategy could be successfully used to either maximise crop yield, or crop and irrigation water use efficiencies. The MPC strategy produced significantly higher yield and crop water use efficiency than the sensor-based strategies for the same (simulated) field conditions (similarly simulated in VARIwise and reported in McCarthy et al., 2014). However, MPC required weather-soil-and-plant, weather-and-soil or weather-and-plant information to accurately calibrate the crop model. This indicates (for cotton grown as stated) that whilst the MPC-based strategies are potentially superior, sensor-based strategies may be more appropriate for field implementations where there is limited data availability. Finally, we note here that direct field evaluation is particularly challenging, because direct comparison requires replicated plots having the same soil types and distributions, and with simultaneous operation such that each experiences the same weather conditions. In principal at least, an alternative to achieve such a comparison would be to determine variability of soil properties under an irrigation system, a priori, and then define plots of the same soil type such that the irrigation application could be adjusted according to different MPC strategies, and in comparison with industry-standard control (e.g. calculated using evapotranspiration or soil–water). Field evaluations would enable the sensing and control hardware requirements and performance of autonomous, adaptive control strategies to be compared with industry-standard irrigation. These control strategies would determine irrigation application and timing using a black-box control system based on sensed inputs and sends control signals to irrigation actuation hardware. This will potentially lead to the optimisation of irrigation water use and yield under different climate scenarios and water availability situations.

A systematic review of automated systems for real-time irrigation management

1. INTRODUCTION
The challenge of feeding a growing population with finite resources is becoming increasingly pressing. By 2050, the world population is expected to reach 9.7 billion, necessitating a 70% increase in food production (Falkenmark and Rockstrom, 2009). Irrigation plays a crucial role in enhancing crop yields and agricultural productivity to meet this growing demand. Studies have shown that irrigation can significantly increase crop water productivity, contributing to increased food production (Ali and Talukder, 2008; Playan and Mateos, 2005). However, water scarcity poses a significant challenge, with many regions facing water deficits and the need for improved water management practices (Falkenmark and Rockstrom, 2009). Optimizing irrigation schedules and doses based on crop requirements and environmental conditions is essential for maximizing yield and quality while minimizing water use (Zhang et al., 2024). The necessity of scalable water-efficient practices for increasing food demand cannot be overstated. Techniques such as regulated deficit irrigation, magnetically treated water, and the use of drought-tolerant crops like sorghum have shown promise in improving water productivity and ensuring food security (Mehmood et al., 2023; Putti et al., 2023; Hadebe et al., 2016). As the global food challenge intensifies, it is imperative to critically evaluate the current state and future potential of irrigation management systems to guide research, innovation, and implementation efforts towards fully autonomous, scalable solutions.

Despite the importance of irrigation in addressing the global food challenge, traditional irrigation management techniques, such as manual scheduling and timer-based systems, have significant limitations. These methods are often labor-intensive, inefficient, and less adaptable to changing conditions (Savin et al., 2023). Manual and timer-based scheduling can lead to high operational costs and inefficient water use (Raghavendra, Han, and Shin, 2023). The reliance on manual intervention and predetermined schedules limits their adaptability to changing environmental conditions, crop water requirements, and soil moisture levels (Kaptein et al., 2019). Sensor-based irrigation systems offer an alternative, enabling real-time adjustments based on soil water status measurements (Kaptein et al., 2019). However, the adoption of these systems in commercial settings has been limited, often requiring extensive input from researchers (Kim et al., 2014; Lea-Cox et al., 2018; Ristvey et al., 2018). The limitations of traditional irrigation management techniques highlight the need for scalable, automated solutions for greater efficiency in irrigation management. Automated systems that collect real-time data, analyze it, and make autonomous irrigation decisions can lead to improved water use efficiency and increased crop productivity (Champness et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2022). To fully understand the potential of automated systems, it is necessary to examine the automation of each part of the irrigation management pipeline and analyze the effectiveness and efficiency of integrated end-to-end solutions.

The emergence of smart irrigation management and IoT marks a significant shift from historical irrigation practices. Modern approaches rely on vast data and analysis algorithms, leveraging technologies such as remote sensing, sensor networks, weather data, and computational algorithms (Atanasov, 2023; Bellvert et al., 2023; Kumar et al., 2023). IoT plays a vital role in collecting vast amounts of data through sensors, data transmission, and tailored networks, enabling real-time monitoring and control of irrigation systems (Liakos, 2023; Zuckerman et al., 2024). These advancements in data collection and analysis have the potential to revolutionize irrigation management, allowing for more precise and efficient water use. However, challenges such as processing diverse data sources, data integration, and lack of integrated data analysis hamper the full benefit of IoT in irrigation management (Dave et al., 2023). The current fragmented approach in smart irrigation, focusing on individual components rather than the entire system, limits the potential for fully autonomous, real-time end-to-end irrigation management (Togneri et al., 2021). To address these challenges and fully realize the potential of smart irrigation management, there is a need for automating and integrating each section of the irrigation management pipeline, from sensor/weather data collection and transmission to processing, analysis, decision-making, and automated action (McKinion and Lemmon, 1985). This integration requires a thorough investigation of the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling seamless communication and compatibility between components within the automated irrigation management pipeline.

Machine learning (ML) plays a significant role in processing vast data, predicting plant stress, modeling climate effects, and optimizing irrigation in smart irrigation management systems. ML algorithms can analyze data collected from sensors and weather stations to determine optimal irrigation schedules (Vianny et al., 2022). However, the potential of ML is often constrained by manual steps, such as data interpretation, decision-making on irrigation timing and volume, and system adjustments. Automating ML integration to allow direct action from insights to irrigation execution, removing bottlenecks and achieving real-time adaptability, is crucial for fully autonomous irrigation management (Barzallo-Bertot et al., 2022). By integrating ML into automated systems, the irrigation management pipeline can become more seamless and efficient, enabling real-time decision-making and action based on data-driven insights. To achieve this level of automation and integration, it is essential to identify gaps and propose solutions for seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, aiming to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.

To achieve seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, interoperability and standardization are critical. Interoperability allows different system components, such as sensors, actuators, and software, to communicate and exchange data effectively, while standardization ensures that data is represented in a consistent format (Santos et al., 2020). Standardized protocols and data formats are essential for achieving seamless integration and ensuring compatibility between components in real-time irrigation management systems (Robles et al., 2022; Hatzivasilis et al., 2018). Existing and emerging standards, such as OGC SensorThings API and ISO 11783, have applicability to real-time irrigation management systems (Hazra et al., 2021). However, challenges such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security need to be addressed to fully realize the potential of interoperability and standardization in automated irrigation management systems (Hazra et al., 2021). Addressing these challenges is crucial for enabling the seamless integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline, which is essential for achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. A comprehensive evaluation of the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling the integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline is necessary to guide future research and implementation efforts.
The primary objective of this systematic review is to critically evaluate the current state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies for enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
Specific objectives include:
•	Examining the automation of each part of the irrigation management pipeline and the seamless integration of each section in the context of irrigation scheduling and management.
•	Analyzing the effectiveness and efficiency of integrated end-to-end automated irrigation systems.

By addressing these objectives, this systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive and critical evaluation of the current state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems. Its intention is to guide future research, innovation, and implementation efforts to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management that can contribute to addressing the global food challenge.

3. DATA COLLECTION TO CLOUD: AUTOMATION AND REAL-TIME PROCESSING
3.1. Irrigation management data
The success of automated irrigation management systems relies heavily on the collection, transmission, and analysis of various types of data. The most applicable data types for irrigation management include soil moisture, canopy temperature, weather data, and plant physiological parameters (Farooq et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Olivier et al., 2021; Evett et al., 2020). These data are typically collected from a range of sources, including in-field sensors, remote sensing platforms, weather stations, and manual measurements (Li et al., 2019; Karimi et al., 2018).
Soil moisture data is arguably the most critical type of data for irrigation management, as it directly reflects the water available to plants and can be used to determine the optimal timing and amount of irrigation (Olivier et al., 2021; Intrigliolo & Castel, 2006). Soil moisture sensors, such as tensiometers, capacitance probes, and time-domain reflectometry (TDR) sensors, can provide real-time measurements of soil water content at various depths (Farooq et al., 2019). These sensors can be deployed in a network configuration to capture spatial variability in soil moisture across a field (Karimi et al., 2018).
Canopy temperature data is another valuable type of data for irrigation management, as it can be used to assess plant water stress and adjust irrigation accordingly (Evett et al., 2020). Infrared thermometers and thermal cameras can be used to measure canopy temperature, which is influenced by factors such as air temperature, humidity, wind speed, and plant water status (Li et al., 2019). When plants experience water stress, they tend to close their stomata to reduce water loss, leading to an increase in canopy temperature (Evett et al., 2020). By monitoring canopy temperature and comparing it to reference values, automated irrigation systems can detect plant water stress and trigger irrigation events to maintain optimal plant health and productivity (Li et al., 2019).
Weather data, including temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, and solar radiation, are essential for predicting crop water requirements and scheduling irrigation events (Akilan & Baalamurugan, 2024). Weather stations equipped with various sensors can provide real-time measurements of these parameters, which can be used as inputs for crop water requirement models, such as the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith equation (Li et al., 2019). These models estimate crop evapotranspiration (ET) based on weather data and crop-specific coefficients, allowing for the calculation of irrigation requirements (Intrigliolo & Castel, 2006). By integrating weather data into automated irrigation systems, irrigation schedules can be dynamically adjusted based on changing environmental conditions, ensuring that crops receive the optimal amount of water at the right time (Akilan & Baalamurugan, 2024).
When collecting and utilizing these data types, several considerations must be taken into account, including the volume, frequency, format, and source of the data (Farooq et al., 2019). The volume of data generated by automated irrigation systems can be substantial, especially when high-resolution sensors are deployed at a large scale (Bastidas Pacheco et al., 2022). This necessitates the use of efficient data storage, processing, and transmission technologies to handle the data load (Farooq et al., 2019). The frequency of data collection is another important consideration, as it directly impacts the temporal resolution of the data and the ability to detect rapid changes in plant water status or environmental conditions (Bastidas Pacheco et al., 2022). Bastidas Pacheco et al. (2022) demonstrated that collecting full pulse resolution data from water meters provides more accurate estimates of event occurrence, timing, and features compared to aggregated temporal resolutions, highlighting the importance of selecting appropriate data collection frequencies to ensure the quality and usefulness of the data for irrigation management.
The format of the data is also crucial, as it determines the compatibility and interoperability of the data with various analysis tools and platforms (Farooq et al., 2019). Standardized data formats, such as JSON, XML, or CSV, can facilitate data exchange and integration between different components of the automated irrigation system (Zhang et al., 2023). The source of the data is another important consideration, as it can impact the reliability, accuracy, and spatial coverage of the data (Farooq et al., 2019). For example, in-field sensors provide highly localized measurements, while remote sensing platforms, such as satellites or drones, can provide data at larger spatial scales (Li et al., 2019). By combining data from multiple sources, automated irrigation systems can achieve a more comprehensive understanding of crop water requirements and optimize irrigation management accordingly (Farooq et al., 2019).
Data quality, accuracy, and reliability are paramount in irrigation management, as they directly impact the effectiveness of decision-making processes and the efficiency of water use (Gupta et al., 2020). Inaccurate or unreliable data can lead to suboptimal irrigation decisions, resulting in crop stress, yield losses, or wasted water resources (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022). Gupta et al. (2020) emphasized the critical importance of data security and privacy in smart farming systems, as the leakage of sensitive agricultural data can cause severe economic losses to farmers and compromise the integrity of the automated irrigation system. The authors also highlighted the need for robust authentication and secure communication protocols to prevent unauthorized access to smart farming systems and protect data in transit (Gupta et al., 2020).
Ramli and Jabbar (2022) addressed the challenges associated with implementing real-time, automated irrigation systems, including data quality, scalability, reliability, and security. They proposed solutions and best practices based on the analysis of case studies and real-world implementations, such as the use of redundant sensors, data validation techniques, and secure communication protocols (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022). The authors also emphasized the importance of regular maintenance and calibration of sensors to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the collected data (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022).
Researchers have investigated the use of data compression, aggregation, and filtering techniques to reduce bandwidth requirements and improve transmission efficiency in automated irrigation systems (Karim et al., 2023; Rady et al., 2020; Cui, 2023). Karim et al. (2023) explored the effectiveness of various data compression techniques, such as lossless and lossy compression algorithms, in reducing the size of data packets transmitted over wireless networks. The authors found that lossless compression techniques, such as Huffman coding and Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW), can significantly reduce data size without compromising data quality, while lossy compression techniques, such as JPEG and MP3, can further reduce data size by introducing acceptable levels of distortion (Karim et al., 2023).
Rady et al. (2020) developed a novel data compression algorithm specifically designed for irrigation data, which achieved significant compression ratios without compromising data quality. The authors demonstrated that their algorithm could reduce the amount of data transmitted over wireless networks, thereby improving the efficiency of the irrigation system and reducing costs (Rady et al., 2020). Cui (2023) investigated the use of data aggregation and filtering techniques to reduce the number of transmissions and save bandwidth in automated irrigation systems. The author proposed a data aggregation scheme that combines multiple sensor readings into a single value, such as the average soil moisture over a specified time interval, to reduce the frequency of data transmissions (Cui, 2023). Additionally, the author explored the use of data filtering techniques, such as Kalman filters and particle filters, to remove noise and outliers from sensor data, improving the accuracy and reliability of the transmitted information (Cui, 2023).
Data standardization and harmonization are crucial for facilitating seamless integration and interoperability between the various components of automated irrigation management systems (Zhang et al., 2023; Ermoliev et al., 2022). Zhang et al. (2023) developed a novel cyberinformatics technology called iCrop, which enables the in-season monitoring of crop-specific land cover across the contiguous United States. The authors highlighted the importance of data standardization and harmonization in the context of iCrop, as it allows for the efficient distribution of crop-specific land cover information based on the findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data principle (Zhang et al., 2023). By adopting standardized data formats and protocols, such as the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards, iCrop enables the seamless integration of various data sources and facilitates the interoperability of the system with other agricultural decision support tools (Zhang et al., 2023).
Ermoliev et al. (2022) proposed a linkage methodology for linking distributed sectoral/regional optimization models in a situation where private information is not available or cannot be shared by modeling teams. The authors emphasized the need for data standardization to enable decentralized cross-sectoral coordination and analysis, as it allows for the consistent representation and exchange of data between different models and stakeholders (Ermoliev et al., 2022). By adopting standardized data formats and interfaces, the proposed linkage methodology can facilitate the integration of various optimization models and support the development of comprehensive decision support systems for sustainable resource management (Ermoliev et al., 2022).
Metadata plays a vital role in providing context and enabling better data interpretation and decision-making in automated irrigation management systems (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021). Metadata refers to the additional information that describes the characteristics, quality, and context of the primary data, such as the sensor type, calibration parameters, measurement units, and timestamp (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021). Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al. (2021) highlighted the importance of metadata in water resources management, as it enables decision-makers to use the data to the best of its capabilities by understanding factors such as when water data was collected and what factors might have contributed to the measurements. The authors emphasized the need for standardized metadata formats and guidelines, such as the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) and the ISO 19115 standard, to ensure the consistency and interoperability of metadata across different water information systems (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021).
In the context of automated irrigation management systems, metadata can provide valuable information about the data collection process, sensor performance, and environmental conditions that can aid in data interpretation and decision-making (Cota & Mamede, 2023). For example, metadata about the sensor type and calibration parameters can help assess the accuracy and reliability of the collected data, while metadata about the weather conditions and soil properties can provide context for interpreting the data and adjusting irrigation strategies accordingly (Cota & Mamede, 2023). By incorporating metadata into the data management and analysis pipeline of automated irrigation systems, decision-makers can make more informed and context-aware decisions, leading to improved water use efficiency and crop productivity (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021).

3.2. Edge Computing and Fog Computing
Edge computing and fog computing have emerged as transformative technologies in the realm of real-time irrigation management systems, offering significant potential for improving efficiency, scalability, and reliability (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2019). Edge computing refers to the practice of processing data near the edge of the network, close to the source of the data, while fog computing is a decentralized computing infrastructure that extends cloud computing capabilities to the network edge (Hassija et al., 2019). These technologies bring computation and analytics closer to the data source, reducing the need for data to travel to the cloud and enabling faster processing and decision-making (Hassija et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020).
The potential of edge computing and fog computing in real-time irrigation management is immense. Abdel Nasser et al. (2020) proposed a two-layer system for water demand prediction using automated meters and machine learning techniques, demonstrating the potential of edge computing in improving the efficiency and scalability of irrigation management. The system collects and aggregates data from distributed smart meters in the first layer, while the second layer uses LSTM neural networks to predict water demand for different regions of households. By leveraging edge computing, the system can achieve high accuracy in predicting water demand, which is essential for efficient irrigation management (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020).
Tran et al. (2019) conducted a comprehensive review of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems, highlighting the role of fog computing in addressing data transmission challenges and enabling seamless integration across the irrigation management pipeline. The authors emphasize that real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems have the potential to significantly improve water efficiency, crop yields, and reduce labor costs. However, they also identify several challenges that need to be addressed, such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security, which can be effectively tackled by implementing fog computing architectures (Tran et al., 2019).
Edge computing offers several benefits in real-time irrigation management systems, including reduced latency, real-time decision-making, and reduced reliance on cloud connectivity (Mishra, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). By processing data closer to the source, edge computing enables faster response times and more efficient data handling (Mishra, 2020). Mishra (2020) highlights that edge computing reduces latency by processing data closer to the source, enabling real-time decision-making and lessening reliance on cloud connectivity by shifting processing to local or edge devices.
Zhang et al. (2020) explore the application of edge computing in agricultural settings, demonstrating its potential to improve the efficiency and accuracy of irrigation systems. The authors discuss how edge computing has prospects in various agricultural applications, such as pest identification, safety traceability of agricultural products, unmanned agricultural machinery, agricultural technology promotion, and intelligent management. They also emphasize that the emergence of edge computing models, such as fog computing, cloudlet, and mobile edge computing, has transformed the management and operation of farms (Zhang et al., 2020).
Fog computing plays a crucial role in distributing processing and storage across the network, enhancing the scalability and reliability of automated irrigation systems (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022; Singh et al., 2022). Premkumar and Sigappi (2022) evaluate the current state of automated irrigation management systems and propose a hybrid machine learning approach for predicting soil moisture and managing irrigation. Their study emphasizes the potential of fog computing in distributing processing and storage across the network, improving the efficiency and scalability of irrigation systems. The proposed hybrid machine learning approach outperforms other machine learning algorithms in predicting soil moisture, demonstrating the effectiveness of fog computing in enhancing the performance of automated irrigation systems (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022).
Singh et al. (2022) discuss the role of fog computing in distributing processing and storage across the network, enhancing scalability and reliability in agricultural management systems. The authors argue that by implementing fog computing, these systems can achieve faster data processing and response times, improving overall efficiency and effectiveness. They also highlight that fog computing can address the challenges faced by real-time data transmission in agricultural management systems, such as latency, bandwidth limitations, and data security (Singh et al., 2022).
The integration of edge and fog computing in real-time irrigation management systems is crucial for achieving fully automated, scalable, and reliable solutions. As the demand for autonomous irrigation management grows, these technologies will play a pivotal role in enabling faster decision-making, reduced latency, improved resource utilization, and seamless integration across the irrigation management pipeline (Tran et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020). By bringing computation and analytics closer to the data source and distributing processing and storage across the network, edge and fog computing can significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of automated irrigation systems, contributing to the overall goal of addressing the global food challenge through optimized water resource management and increased agricultural productivity (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022; Singh et al., 2022).

3.3. Automation of Data Collection
The automation of data collection is a critical component in the development of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies. It enables the efficient gathering of vital information about crop health, environmental conditions, and water requirements, which is essential for enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity. Two key aspects of automated data collection are the use of advanced sensing technologies for non-invasive plant stress detection and the implementation of wireless sensor networks and energy-efficient communication protocols for large-scale, long-term data collection.
Advanced sensing technologies, such as hyperspectral imaging and thermal sensing, have emerged as powerful tools for non-invasive plant stress detection in automated irrigation management systems. These technologies provide valuable information about crop traits, enabling early and accurate detection of plant health issues (Triantafyllou et al., 2019). Triantafyllou et al. (2019) propose a comprehensive reference architecture model that incorporates advanced sensing technologies in the sensor layer for real-time plant stress detection, highlighting their importance in providing non-invasive plant stress detection. Similarly, Hossain et al. (2023) present a novel IoT-ML-Blockchain integrated framework for smart agricultural management that leverages advanced sensing technologies to optimize water use and improve crop yield, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
Hyperspectral imaging can capture subtle changes in plant physiology that are indicative of stress, while machine learning algorithms can be employed to extract meaningful patterns from the spectral data and classify different stress types (Araus et al., 2014). Thermal sensing can detect changes in canopy temperature, which is influenced by factors such as plant water status (Li et al., 2019). By monitoring canopy temperature and comparing it to reference values, automated irrigation systems can detect plant water stress and trigger irrigation events to maintain optimal plant health and productivity (Li et al., 2019).
The integration of advanced sensing technologies in automated irrigation management systems has the potential to revolutionize precision agriculture. Jiang et al. (2019) demonstrate the effectiveness of a deep learning-based model in accurately detecting leaf spot diseases, highlighting the importance of image augmentation and deep learning algorithms in enhancing the model's performance.
Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and energy-efficient communication protocols have the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and reliability of data collection in large-scale, long-term irrigation systems. WSNs offer a cost-effective and scalable solution for real-time data collection in large-scale irrigation systems, providing remote monitoring and automated control capabilities (Mehdizadeh et al., 2020). Nishiura and Yamamoto (2021) propose a novel sensor network system that utilizes drones and wireless power transfer to autonomously collect environmental data from sensor nodes in vast agricultural fields, reducing operational costs and enhancing the efficiency of data collection. Similarly, Higashiura and Yamamoto (2021) introduce a network system that employs UAVs and LoRa communication to efficiently collect environmental data from sensor nodes distributed across large farmlands, optimizing data collection and reducing travel distance and time.
Energy-efficient communication protocols are crucial for ensuring reliable data transmission in challenging environmental conditions and extending the lifespan of sensor nodes (Mehdizadeh et al., 2020). Al-Ali et al. (2023) investigate the potential of WSNs and energy-efficient communication protocols for data collection in large-scale, long-term irrigation systems, discussing the challenges and opportunities of using these technologies to improve the efficiency and reliability of real-time data collection in irrigation management. Mehdizadeh et al. (2020) emphasize the need for careful consideration of factors such as data accuracy, energy consumption, and network reliability when designing effective WSNs for irrigation management, enabling timely irrigation decisions and improved crop yields.
The automation of data collection through the use of advanced sensing technologies and wireless sensor networks is essential for achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. By enabling non-invasive plant stress detection and large-scale, long-term data collection, these technologies contribute to the overall goal of optimizing water resource management and increasing agricultural productivity. The integration of these technologies in real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems has the potential to enhance agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity, ultimately contributing to the development of fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management solutions.

3.4: Real-Time Data Transmission Protocols and Technologies
Real-time data transmission is a critical component of automated irrigation management systems, as it enables the timely delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of suitable protocols and network architectures is essential for ensuring efficient and reliable data transmission in these systems, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
The Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol has emerged as a popular choice for real-time data transmission in IoT networks, including those used for automated irrigation management. MQTT is a lightweight, publish-subscribe protocol designed for constrained devices and low-bandwidth networks (Author, 2019). Its simplicity and low overhead make it well-suited for IoT applications where data transmission speed and energy efficiency are critical (Saranyadevi et al., 2022). MQTT provides three Quality of Service (QoS) levels, ensuring data reliability in real-time scenarios (Author, 2019). Chen et al. (2020) proposed novel algorithms to improve data exchange efficiency and handle rerouting in MQTT-based IoT networks for automated irrigation management systems. Their TBRouting algorithm efficiently finds the shortest paths for data transmission, while the Rerouting algorithm effectively handles the rerouting of topic-based session flows when a broker crashes. The combination of these algorithms can significantly improve the performance and reliability of automated irrigation management systems (Chen et al., 2020).
Client-server IoT networks, such as those based on MQTT, play a crucial role in real-time data transmission for automated irrigation management systems. In these networks, sensors and devices (clients) publish data to a central broker (server), which then distributes the data to subscribed clients (Verma et al., 2021). This architecture enables efficient data collection, processing, and dissemination, facilitating the integration of various components within the automated irrigation management pipeline. Verma et al. (2021) proposed an architecture for healthcare monitoring systems using IoT and communication protocols, which provides a comprehensive overview of existing approaches and highlights challenges and opportunities in the field. Although focused on healthcare, the insights from this study can be applied to automated irrigation management systems, emphasizing the importance of interoperability and standardization for seamless integration (Verma et al., 2021).
In addition to MQTT, other application layer protocols such as XMPP, CoAP, SOAP, and HTTP have been explored for real-time data transmission in IoT networks. Each protocol has its strengths and weaknesses, making them suitable for different applications and scenarios. XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) is an open-standard protocol that supports real-time messaging, presence, and request-response services (Saint-Andre, 2011). CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) is a specialized web transfer protocol designed for use with constrained nodes and networks in the Internet of Things (Shelby et al., 2014). SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services, while HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web (Fielding et al., 1999).
Motamedi and Villányi (2022) compared and evaluated wireless communication protocols for the implementation of smart irrigation systems in greenhouses, considering factors such as power consumption, range, reliability, and scalability. They found that ZigBee is the most suitable local communication protocol for greenhouse irrigation due to its large number of nodes and long range, while MQTT is the recommended messaging protocol for smart irrigation systems due to its TCP transport protocol and quality of service (QoS) options. GSM is a reliable and cost-effective global communication protocol for greenhouse irrigation, providing wide coverage and low cost (Motamedi & Villányi, 2022).
Syafarinda et al. (2018) investigated the use of the MQTT protocol in a precision agriculture system using a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). They found that MQTT is suitable for use in IoT applications due to its lightweight, simple, and low bandwidth requirements. The average data transmission speed using the MQTT protocol was approximately 1 second, demonstrating its effectiveness for real-time data transmission in precision agriculture systems (Syafarinda et al., 2018).
The choice of application layer protocol for real-time irrigation management depends on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. MQTT and RTPS (Real-Time Publish-Subscribe) are both suitable for real-time data transmission in IoT systems, but they have different strengths and weaknesses. MQTT is a better choice for applications that require low latency and high throughput, while RTPS is a better choice for applications that require high reliability and low latency (Sanchez-Iborra & Skarmeta, 2021). The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of various application layer protocols, provides valuable insights into the suitability of these technologies for real-time data transmission in automated irrigation management systems.
In summary, real-time data transmission protocols and technologies play a vital role in the automation of irrigation management systems, enabling the efficient and reliable delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of application layer protocols, highlights the importance of selecting suitable technologies based on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. By leveraging these technologies, automated irrigation management systems can achieve seamless integration and contribute to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.

3.5. Challenges and Solutions in Real-Time Data Transmission
Following the exploration of data collection, processing at the edge and fog, and automation in previous sections, we now turn to the critical aspect of real-time data transmission. While essential for automated irrigation management, this stage presents unique challenges that must be addressed to ensure system efficiency and reliability.
Obstacles in Real-Time Data Transmission
Agricultural environments present unique challenges for real-time data transmission, directly impacting the effectiveness of automated irrigation systems. Environmental factors can significantly disrupt wireless communication. Adverse weather conditions such as heavy rain, fog, and high winds can weaken or even block radio signals, leading to data loss and compromised system performance. Physical obstacles like trees, buildings, and uneven terrain further complicate signal propagation, creating reliability issues (Jukan et al., 2017; Yi & Ji, 2014; Zhang, Chang & Baoguo, 2018). These environmental challenges necessitate robust communication protocols and network architectures that can ensure consistent and reliable data flow.
In addition to environmental factors, technical limitations also present significant obstacles. Large-scale agricultural operations often demand long-distance data transmission, which can be hindered by the limited range of certain wireless communication protocols. Network congestion, occurring when multiple sensors transmit data concurrently, can lead to delays and potential data loss, further complicating real-time decision-making (Hameed et al., 2020). To mitigate these issues, researchers have investigated the potential of cognitive radio networks (CRNs) and dynamic spectrum access (DSA) for optimizing spectrum utilization and reducing interference (Righi et al., 2017; Shafi et al., 2018; Trigka & Dritsas, 2022). CRNs enable devices to intelligently sense and adapt to the surrounding radio environment, dynamically adjusting transmission parameters to avoid interference and improve communication efficiency. DSA, on the other hand, facilitates the dynamic allocation of unused spectrum, enhancing spectrum utilization and reducing congestion.
Furthermore, data security and privacy are paramount concerns in real-time irrigation systems. The sensitive nature of agricultural data, such as crop yields and farm management practices, necessitates robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches (Gupta et al., 2020). Implementing secure communication protocols, authentication mechanisms, and encryption techniques is essential to protect data integrity and ensure the trustworthiness of the system.
Investigating Data Optimization Techniques
To enhance the efficiency and reliability of real-time data transmission in automated irrigation systems, researchers have explored a range of data optimization techniques. Data compression techniques aim to reduce the size of data packets transmitted over the network, minimizing bandwidth requirements and improving transmission speed (Rady et al., 2020; Karim et al., 2023). Lossless compression algorithms, such as Huffman coding and LZW, preserve data integrity while effectively reducing data size, ensuring that no information is lost during transmission (Cui, 2023). Lossy compression algorithms, such as JPEG and MP3, offer higher compression ratios but introduce a controlled level of data loss, which may be acceptable for certain applications where some loss of precision is tolerable (Karim et al., 2023). The choice between lossless and lossy compression depends on the specific application and the trade-off between data size and accuracy.
Data aggregation techniques provide another effective approach to optimize data transmission. By aggregating multiple sensor readings into a single representative value, such as average soil moisture or temperature, the number of transmissions can be significantly reduced, conserving bandwidth and energy resources (Cui, 2023). This is particularly beneficial in large-scale irrigation systems where numerous sensors are deployed across vast areas, generating substantial amounts of data. Additionally, data filtering techniques play a crucial role in improving data quality and reliability. Kalman filters and particle filters can effectively remove noise and outliers from sensor data, ensuring that only accurate and relevant information is transmitted and used for decision-making (Cui, 2023). This is essential for preventing erroneous data from influencing irrigation decisions and potentially leading to suboptimal water management.
Sensor calibration, drift correction, and fault detection are essential for maintaining data accuracy and reliability (Dos Santos et al., 2023). Regular calibration ensures that sensors provide accurate measurements over time, while drift correction techniques account for gradual changes in sensor readings due to environmental factors or aging. Fault detection mechanisms can identify and address sensor malfunctions or anomalies, preventing erroneous data from influencing irrigation decisions and potentially harming crops or wasting water.
Addressing the Challenges
Effectively addressing the challenges in real-time data transmission requires a multifaceted approach that encompasses environmental, technical, and data-related considerations. Implementing robust and adaptive communication protocols is crucial for overcoming interference and signal degradation caused by weather conditions and physical obstacles. Selecting appropriate protocols, such as LoRa or ZigBee, with suitable range and penetration capabilities can ensure reliable data transmission in challenging agricultural environments (Motamedi & Villányi, 2022). Additionally, employing techniques like frequency hopping and error correction codes can further improve communication resilience and mitigate data loss.
Optimizing network architecture is another key consideration. Deploying a distributed network architecture with edge and fog computing capabilities can significantly enhance data processing and transmission efficiency (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2019). Edge devices can perform initial data processing and aggregation tasks, reducing the amount of data transmitted to the cloud and minimizing latency, while fog nodes can provide additional processing power and storage closer to the data source, enhancing scalability and reliability. This distributed approach alleviates the burden on the central cloud server and allows for more responsive and efficient irrigation management.
Data optimization techniques play a vital role in reducing bandwidth requirements and improving transmission efficiency. The choice of data compression, aggregation, and filtering techniques should be tailored to the specific requirements of the irrigation system, considering factors such as data type, accuracy needs, and available bandwidth. By carefully selecting and implementing these techniques, the overall performance and effectiveness of real-time irrigation systems can be significantly enhanced, leading to more sustainable water management practices and improved agricultural productivity.
By addressing these challenges and implementing appropriate solutions, real-time data transmission can become a reliable and efficient component of automated irrigation systems, contributing to the overall goal of achieving sustainable and productive agriculture in the face of growing food demands and water scarcity.

3.6. IoT Network Architectures and Variable Rate Irrigation (VRI) for Real-Time Irrigation
Real-time irrigation management systems heavily rely on the efficient and reliable transmission of data from sensors and weather stations to the cloud for processing and decision-making. However, agricultural environments present unique challenges to wireless communication, including adverse weather conditions, physical obstacles, and the limitations of wireless technologies. These challenges necessitate robust and adaptive solutions to ensure the consistent and timely flow of data, enabling truly autonomous irrigation scheduling.
Environmental factors, such as heavy rain, fog, and strong winds, can significantly disrupt wireless communication by attenuating or even blocking radio signals, leading to data loss and compromised system performance (Ed-daoudi et al., 2023; Jukan et al., 2017; Yi & Ji, 2014; Zhang, Chang & Baoguo, 2018). Dense vegetation, buildings, and uneven terrain create further complications by causing multipath propagation and shadowing effects (Yim et al., 2018; Gautam and Pagay, 2020). The study by Yim et al. (2018) on LoRa networks in a tree farm environment exemplifies these challenges, revealing reduced communication range and data reliability compared to theoretical expectations. This underscores the need for carefully selecting and optimizing communication protocols and network parameters to ensure reliable data transmission in such environments.
The study by Guzinski et al. (2014a) using a modified TSEB model further highlights the importance of high-resolution data in accurately capturing the spatial and temporal dynamics of energy fluxes influenced by environmental factors. This emphasizes the need for advanced data acquisition and processing techniques that can effectively represent the complexities of agricultural settings.
The limitations of traditional wireless communication technologies, such as limited range and network congestion, pose additional challenges for large-scale agricultural operations. Long-distance data transmission can be hindered by range limitations, while network congestion arising from numerous sensors transmitting concurrently can lead to delays and data loss, hindering real-time decision-making (Hameed et al., 2020). Addressing these challenges requires the exploration of advanced networking technologies that can optimize spectrum utilization, mitigate interference, and improve reliability and efficiency.
Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) and Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) offer promising solutions for optimizing wireless communication in agricultural settings. CRNs empower devices with the ability to intelligently sense and adapt to the surrounding radio environment, dynamically adjusting transmission parameters to avoid interference and improve communication efficiency (Righi et al., 2017; Shafi et al., 2018; Trigka & Dritsas, 2022). Research has explored the potential of CRNs in predicting Radio Frequency (RF) power to avoid noisy channels and optimize spectrum utilization (Iliya et al., 2014; Iliya et al., 2014). These studies demonstrate the effectiveness of combining optimization algorithms with artificial neural networks (ANNs) to enhance the accuracy and generalization of RF power prediction, enabling CRNs to make informed decisions about channel selection and avoid interference.
DSA complements CRN technology by dynamically allocating unused spectrum, further enhancing spectrum utilization and reducing congestion (Shi et al., 2023). The numerical model developed by Shi et al. (2023) showcases the potential of CRNs and DSA for optimizing wireless communication in challenging environments.
The integration of CRNs and DSA into the IoT network architecture requires careful consideration of spectrum sensing techniques, network topology, and data security. Research on cooperative spectrum sensing suggests that distributed approaches, where sensor nodes collaborate and share information, can significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of spectrum sensing, particularly in dynamic environments (Trigka and Dritsas, 2022; Khalid & Yu, 2019). This collaborative approach enables a more comprehensive understanding of the radio environment and facilitates the identification of available frequency bands for data transmission.
The choice of network topology also impacts the performance and scalability of CRN-based irrigation systems. Mesh networks, where sensor nodes are interconnected and relay data for each other, offer enhanced resilience and coverage compared to star topologies where nodes communicate directly with a central gateway (Akyildiz & Vuran, 2010). However, mesh networks can be more complex to manage and may introduce additional routing overhead. The trade-off between network resilience and complexity needs to be carefully evaluated to select the most appropriate topology for a specific agricultural setting.
Data security and privacy are paramount concerns in IoT-based irrigation systems due to the sensitive nature of agricultural data (Gupta et al., 2020). Implementing secure communication protocols, authentication mechanisms, and encryption techniques is essential for protecting data integrity and ensuring system trustworthiness. Research on secure spectrum leasing and resource allocation algorithms for CR-WSN-based irrigation systems has demonstrated the potential of these technologies for enhancing security and efficiency (Hassan, 2023; Afghah et al., 2018).
In conclusion, the development of effective and reliable real-time irrigation management systems requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the challenges of data transmission in agricultural environments. The integration of robust and adaptive communication protocols, optimized network architectures, and advanced networking technologies like CRNs and DSA, along with a focus on data security and privacy, can contribute significantly to achieving the goal of autonomous and efficient irrigation scheduling.
4. AUTOMATED DATA PROCESSING IN THE CLOUD
4.1. Data Quality and Preprocessing
Data quality is paramount in automated irrigation systems as it directly influences the effectiveness of decision-making and water use efficiency. Issues like missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers arising from sensor malfunctions, environmental interference, or network problems (Lv et al., 2023) can significantly impact the performance of machine learning models used for irrigation scheduling and management.
Real-time data cleaning techniques are essential for addressing these challenges. Kalman filtering proves particularly effective in handling missing values and correcting erroneous readings by recursively estimating the system's state based on previous measurements and current sensor data, taking into account noise and uncertainty (Kim et al., 2020). Moving average techniques, by averaging consecutive data points, provide a more stable representation of the underlying trend, filtering out short-term fluctuations (Chhetri, 2023). For outlier detection, adaptive thresholding methods offer a dynamic approach, adjusting thresholds based on the statistical properties of the data to effectively identify anomalies and minimize false positives (Bah et al., 2021). These techniques are crucial in maintaining the integrity of real-time data streams and ensuring the accuracy of subsequent analyses.
Adaptive data preprocessing is essential for managing the diversity of data sources and formats commonly found in irrigation systems. Data normalization techniques, such as min-max scaling or z-score normalization, ensure that all features contribute equally to the analysis by transforming data values to a common scale (Pradal et al., 2016). This is crucial for preventing features with larger values from dominating the analysis and ensuring that all features are given equal consideration. Similarly, feature scaling methods, like standardization or normalization, optimize the range of feature values to improve the performance and convergence of machine learning models (Tortorici et al., 2024). By scaling features to a similar range, the influence of outliers is reduced, and the model's ability to learn from the data is enhanced.
Data fusion techniques play a critical role in integrating information from diverse sources, creating a more comprehensive and reliable dataset for irrigation management. Dempster-Shafer theory, a generalization of probability theory, allows for the expression of both uncertainty and the degree of conflict in evidence, making it suitable for fusing uncertain and conflicting data from heterogeneous sources (Sadiq and Rodriguez, 2004). This is particularly relevant in irrigation systems where data from different sensors may provide slightly different or even contradictory information due to sensor variations or environmental factors. Bayesian inference offers another powerful framework for combining information from multiple sources, updating the probability of a hypothesis as new evidence becomes available. By applying these techniques, data from soil moisture sensors, canopy temperature sensors, weather stations, and other sources can be integrated to provide a holistic understanding of crop water requirements and environmental conditions, leading to more informed and accurate irrigation decisions.
The impact of data quality extends beyond model accuracy to the robustness of machine learning models under varying conditions. Robust models should maintain consistent performance even when faced with data inconsistencies or unexpected situations. Techniques like data augmentation and domain adaptation can enhance model robustness by exposing the model to a wider range of data variations during training. Data augmentation involves generating additional training data by applying transformations or introducing noise to existing data, making the model more resilient to noise and variations in the real-world data. Domain adaptation techniques aim to adapt a model trained on one domain (e.g., a specific crop or geographic location) to perform well on another domain with different data characteristics. This is particularly relevant in irrigation management, where models may need to be applied to different crops, soil types, or climatic conditions.
The choice of data cleaning, preprocessing, and fusion techniques should be carefully considered based on the specific characteristics of the irrigation system and the available data. By selecting and implementing appropriate techniques, the accuracy, reliability, and robustness of machine learning models can be significantly improved, leading to more efficient and sustainable irrigation management practices.
4.2. Scalable and Autonomous Deployment using Containerization Strategies
The transition from data collection and transmission to efficient data processing requires a robust infrastructure capable of handling diverse workloads and data volumes. Containerization technologies, specifically Docker and Kubernetes, offer a promising solution for deploying and scaling data processing and machine learning modules within cloud environments like AWS, Azure, and GCP (Vargas-Rojas et al., 2024; Rosendo et al., 2022; Solayman & Qasha, 2023). Docker provides a standardized way to package applications and their dependencies into self-contained units known as containers, ensuring consistent and reproducible execution across different platforms (Rosendo et al., 2022). Kubernetes, acting as a container orchestrator, manages their deployment, scaling, and networking across a cluster of machines (Rosendo et al., 2022). This combination presents several advantages for automated irrigation management systems.
Firstly, containerization facilitates efficient resource utilization and scalability. By encapsulating applications and their dependencies, containers enable the isolation of resources and prevent conflicts between different modules (Vargas-Rojas et al., 2024; Solayman & Qasha, 2023). This isolation allows for the efficient allocation of resources, such as CPU, memory, and storage, to each container based on its specific needs. Kubernetes further enhances scalability by allowing for the automatic scaling of containers based on real-time demand, ensuring the system can adapt to varying workloads and data volumes, preventing bottlenecks, and ensuring responsiveness to changing conditions (Karamolegkos et al., 2023).
Secondly, containerization promotes portability and reproducibility. By packaging applications and their dependencies into a single unit, containers make it easy to move and deploy them across different cloud environments without the need for environment-specific configurations (Rosendo et al., 2022; Solayman & Qasha, 2023). This portability simplifies the development and deployment process, reducing the time and effort required to set up and manage the system. Additionally, containers ensure reproducibility by providing a consistent execution environment, regardless of the underlying infrastructure. This eliminates variability and ensures that the system will behave consistently across different deployments (Zhou et al., 2023).
Optimizing container orchestration and resource allocation is crucial to minimizing latency and maximizing throughput in real-time data processing pipelines. Techniques like auto-scaling and dynamic resource allocation play a critical role in this context (Hethcoat et al., 2024; Werner and Tai, 2023; Kumar et al., 2024). Auto-scaling automatically adjusts the number of container instances based on real-time demand, ensuring that sufficient resources are available to handle peak workloads while avoiding over-provisioning during periods of low demand (Hethcoat et al., 2024; Kumar et al., 2024). Dynamic resource allocation enables the fine-grained adjustment of resources allocated to each container based on its specific needs and the current workload (Werner and Tai, 2023). This ensures efficient resource allocation and provides each container with the necessary resources to perform its tasks effectively.
Performance monitoring tools, such as Kubernetes Metrics Server and Prometheus, are essential for gaining insights into the performance of containers and the overall system (Hethcoat et al., 2024; Kuity & Peddoju, 2023). These tools provide valuable data on key performance indicators, such as CPU and memory usage, network traffic, and application-specific metrics. By monitoring this data, administrators can identify bottlenecks, optimize resource allocation strategies, and continuously improve system performance (Hethcoat et al., 2024). This data-driven approach ensures that automated irrigation management systems can operate efficiently and reliably.
By integrating containerization technologies with optimization techniques and performance monitoring, automated irrigation management systems achieve the scalability, autonomy, and efficiency required for effective real-time data processing and decision-making. This approach facilitates a seamless and responsive system that can adapt to changing conditions and contribute to the overall goal of optimizing water resource management and increasing agricultural productivity.

4.3. Deploying ML Models for Data Processing
Transitioning from data collection, preprocessing, and transmission, the deployment of machine learning (ML) models marks a pivotal stage in the automated irrigation management pipeline. This stage entails utilizing cloud platforms to facilitate real-time data processing and inference, enabling data-driven decision-making for optimal irrigation management and ultimately contributing to fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.
Several architectures and frameworks exist for deploying ML models on cloud platforms, each offering unique advantages and catering to different requirements. TensorFlow Serving, for instance, provides a high-performance system specifically designed for serving TensorFlow models (Abadi et al., 2016). This framework enables efficient and scalable inference, making it suitable for real-time applications where low latency and high throughput are crucial. For instance, in a large-scale irrigation system with numerous sensors generating data continuously, TensorFlow Serving can efficiently handle the high volume of inference requests and provide timely predictions for irrigation scheduling. Similarly, Apache MXNet Model Server offers a flexible and efficient solution for deploying models trained with MXNet, supporting a wide range of deep learning models and inference backends (MXNet Developers, 2015). This versatility makes it suitable for complex irrigation systems that may utilize different types of ML models for various tasks, such as predicting crop water requirements, detecting plant stress, or forecasting weather conditions. ONNX Runtime, on the other hand, provides a cross-platform inference engine compatible with various ML frameworks, including PyTorch, TensorFlow, and MXNet (Microsoft, 2017). This versatility enables the deployment of models in diverse environments, facilitating interoperability and reducing the need for model conversion. For example, an irrigation system that uses models trained in different frameworks can utilize ONNX Runtime to deploy them on a single platform without the need for time-consuming and error-prone model conversion processes.
Choosing the appropriate architecture or framework depends on several factors, including the specific ML framework used for model training, the desired level of performance and scalability, and the need for cross-platform compatibility. For instance, if the primary concern is low latency and high throughput for real-time inference, TensorFlow Serving might be the optimal choice for TensorFlow models. However, if flexibility and support for various deep learning models are required, Apache MXNet Model Server could be more suitable. In cases where cross-platform compatibility is essential, ONNX Runtime offers a versatile solution.
Once the ML model is deployed, optimizing its performance and resource utilization becomes crucial for ensuring the efficiency of integrated end-to-end automated irrigation systems. Model compression techniques, such as pruning and quantization, offer effective methods for reducing the size and computational requirements of ML models without compromising accuracy (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). Pruning involves eliminating unnecessary connections or neurons from the model, effectively streamlining its structure and reducing computational complexity. This can be particularly beneficial for deep learning models, which often have a large number of parameters and can be prone to overfitting. By removing redundant or less important connections, pruning can improve modelgeneralizability and reduce inference time. Quantization, on the other hand, involves reducing the precision of model parameters, typically from 32-bit floating-point numbers to lower-precision formats such as 8-bit integers. This reduction in precision leads to smaller model sizes and faster inference speeds, making it particularly beneficial for resource-constrained environments or real-time applications. For instance, in edge computing scenarios where ML models are deployed on devices with limited computational resources, quantization can enable efficient inference without sacrificing accuracy.
Furthermore, hardware acceleration through the utilization of GPUs or TPUs can significantly enhance model performance by leveraging specialized hardware designed for parallel processing (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). GPUs, with their massive parallelism and high memory bandwidth, excel at accelerating matrix operations and convolutions, which are fundamental computations in many deep learning models. This acceleration can significantly reduce inference time and enable real-time processing of sensor data for timely irrigation decisions. TPUs, specifically designed for deep learning workloads, offer even greater performance and energy efficiency for specific model architectures. These hardware accelerators can drastically reduce inference time, enabling near real-time decision-making and enhancing the responsiveness of automated irrigation systems. For example, in a scenario where immediate response to changing weather conditions or soil moisture levels is critical, hardware acceleration can ensure that irrigation decisions are made and executed promptly.
In addition to model compression and hardware acceleration, distributed training techniques play a crucial role in optimizing the training process for large-scale ML models. Techniques such as Horovod and BytePS enable the distribution of training across multiple machines, effectively parallelizing the process and reducing training time (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). This is particularly beneficial for complex models with a large number of parameters or when dealing with large datasets. By leveraging distributed training, irrigation management systems can train more sophisticated models and improve their predictive capabilities, leading to more accurate and efficient irrigation decisions. For instance, a system that utilizes a deep learning model with millions of parameters can benefit from distributed training to reduce training time from days to hours, enabling faster model iteration and improvement.
Integrating the deployed ML models with other components of the automated irrigation management pipeline is essential for achieving a fully autonomous and cohesive system and addressing the need for seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system. Standardized protocols, such as MQTT and CoAP, provide lightweight and efficient communication channels for exchanging data between these components (Poojara et al., 2023; Jimenez et al., 2020a; Gour et al., 2023). MQTT, with its publish-subscribe architecture, enables real-time data streaming and event-driven communication, making it suitable for transmitting sensor data, control signals, and inference results (Raikar & M, 2023). This enables the ML model to receive real-time updates on soil moisture, weather conditions, and plant health, allowing for dynamic adjustments to irrigation schedules based on the latest data. CoAP, designed for constrained devices and low-power networks, offers a web-transfer protocol for resource-constrained environments, enabling efficient communication between sensors, actuators, and the ML models (Raikar & M, 2023). This is particularly relevant in situations where sensors or actuators have limited processing power or battery life, as CoAP minimizes communication overhead and energy consumption. Additionally, RESTful APIs provide a standardized interface for accessing and controlling the ML models, enabling seamless integration with other software components and facilitating system management and monitoring (Wang et al., 2022). This allows for easy integration with existing farm management systems or third-party applications, creating a unified platform for comprehensive irrigation management.4.4. Online Learning in the Cloud
The complexities of real-time data processing in irrigation management necessitate the exploration of advanced techniques to continuously learn and adapt to the dynamic nature of agricultural environments. Online learning algorithms offer a promising solution, enabling the continuous update and improvement of machine learning models based on incoming real-time data. This adaptability is crucial for addressing the challenges of changing environmental conditions, such as weather patterns and crop growth stages, and optimizing irrigation decision-making to enhance water usage efficiency and crop productivity.
Several online learning algorithms have demonstrated potential for real-time data processing and model adaptation in the context of irrigation management. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) facilitates the incremental update of model parameters with each new data point, allowing for efficient adaptation to changing data distributions (Bottou, 2010). This incremental learning process ensures that the model remains responsive to the latest conditions, minimizing the risk of outdated predictions and improving the accuracy of irrigation decisions. Passive-Aggressive algorithms, on the other hand, adjust model parameters only when a misclassification occurs, providing a computationally efficient approach for handling large data streams (Crammer et al., 2006). These algorithms offer a robust approach to handling noisy data, a common challenge in real-world sensor readings, by making small adjustments only when the model's prediction deviates significantly from the actual value (Fei et al., 2019). Online Random Forests extend the concept of random forests to the online setting, enabling the incremental construction and update of decision trees as new data arrives (Saffari et al., 2009). The continuous evolution of the ensemble ensures that the model remains relevant to the changing environment, capturing intricate relationships between variables and leading to more informed irrigation decisions.
Research in various domains highlights the importance of online learning for real-time data stream analytics. Snyder et al. (2020) explored the application of online learning techniques for identifying relevant tweets in real-time, improving situational awareness for first responders. The proposed interactive learning framework allows users to continuously label the relevance of incoming tweets, enabling the real-time refinement of the underlying machine learning model. This user-guided approach aligns well with the dynamic nature of irrigation management, where models need to continuously adjust to varying environmental conditions and crop water requirements. Similarly, research in the field of cyber-physical systems (CPS) underscores the need for online learning algorithms to effectively extract insights and knowledge from continuously generated data streams (Fei et al., 2019). These capabilities are crucial for enabling feedback loops between physical processes and cyber elements, facilitating the integration and optimization of CPS in irrigation management systems.
To implement online learning in cloud-based irrigation management systems, various architectures and frameworks can be considered. Apache Spark Streaming, Apache Flink, and AWS Kinesis provide scalable and fault-tolerant platforms for processing real-time data streams, allowing for the development of online learning pipelines that continuously ingest and analyze data to update machine learning models (Zaharia et al., 2012; Carbone et al., 2015; Amazon Web Services, 2023). These frameworks leverage serverless computing paradigms, automatically scaling resources based on the volume and velocity of incoming data, ensuring efficient resource utilization and responsiveness to fluctuations in demand (Fei et al., 2019).
Effectively managing the exploration-exploitation trade-off is crucial for optimizing online learning in irrigation management. Techniques such as Multi-armed bandits (Sutton & Barto, 2018), Bayesian optimization (Shahriari et al., 2016), and Reinforcement Learning (RL) (Sutton & Barto, 2018) can be employed to balance the allocation of resources between exploring new irrigation strategies and exploiting the current best-performing approaches. These techniques enable the identification of optimal irrigation policies, adapting to changing environmental conditions and maximizing long-term rewards.
In conclusion, online learning techniques, coupled with scalable cloud-based architectures, offer a powerful solution for real-time data processing and continuous adaptation in irrigation management systems. By leveraging algorithms like SGD, Passive-Aggressive, and Online Random Forests, along with stream processing frameworks like Apache Spark Streaming, Apache Flink, and AWS Kinesis, irrigation management systems can effectively handle the complexities of real-time data, optimize water usage, and enhance crop productivity in the face of dynamic environmental conditions.

5. GENERATING AND APPLYING IRRIGATION INSIGHTS 
5.1. Real-Time Generation of Actionable Irrigation Insights
The transition from data collection and processing to actionable irrigation insights requires the extracting spatial features from images, allowing for the analysis of satellite or drone imagery to assess crop health, detect water stress, and provide insights into irrigation needs (Os deployment of advanced predictive models capable of generating precise and site-specific irrigation recommendations.roosh et al., 2016).
Furthermore, the integration Deep learning models, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and of data from diverse sources, including IoT sensors and cloud-based platforms, plays Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have demonstrated excellent performance in capturing complex relationships a critical role in enhancing the accuracy and resolution of real-time irrigation insights. Data fusion techniques, such as Kalman filtering, offer a robust approach for combining information between input variables and predicting crop water requirements (Keller, 2023; Naphade et al., 2022). These models can effectively from multiple sensors, accounting for noise and uncertainty, and providing a more comprehensive understanding of crop water requirements (Cohen et al., 2005; Mö handle the temporal dependencies present in time-series data, such as soil moisture andeller et al., 2007). By integrating data from soil moisture weather data, and learn to predict future water needs based on historical patterns and current sensors, weather stations, and remote sensing platforms, ML models can generate more accurate conditions. Ensemble methods, such as Random Forests, also offer a robust approach to and site-specific irrigation recommendations, leading to improved water use efficiency and crop productivity prediction by combining multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce the risk of overfitting.
The heterogeneity, uncertainty, and quality issues inherent in real-time data streams require careful consideration and the implementation of effective strategies to ensure the reliability of generated (Singh et al., 2016).
The integration of irrigation insights. Data preprocessing techniques, such as outlier detection and missing value imputation, IoT sensor data with cloud-based data sources is crucial for enhancing the accuracy and resolution of irrigation insights. IoT sensors, such as soil moisture probes and weather stations are essential for preparing the data for analysis and preventing erroneous data from influencing the model, provide real-time, localized data on crop and environmental conditions, while cloud's predictions (Fiksel, 2003). Additionally,-based sources, such as weather forecasts and satellite imagery, offer broader spatial and the selection of appropriate ML models and data fusion techniques should be tailored to the specific temporal perspectives (López-Morales et al., 2020). characteristics of the irrigation system and the available data to mitigate uncertainty and ensure the robustness Data fusion techniques, such as Kalman filtering, play a critical role in combining these of generated insights.
To address computational complexity and latency challenges in real-time irrigation insight generation, techniques such as edge computing, model compression, and hardware accelerators heterogeneous data sources to generate more accurate and comprehensive irrigation recommendations (Cohen et al., offer promising solutions. Edge computing enables the distribution of processing tasks closer to the data 2005; Möeller et al., 2007 source, reducing latency and enabling faster response times (Mishra, 20). By incorporating data from multiple sources, irrigation models can better account for spatial variability20; Zhang et al., 2020). Model compression techniques, such as pruning and quantization, can significantly reduce the size and computational requirements of in soil moisture, microclimate conditions, and crop water requirements, leading to more ML models without compromising accuracy, making them suitable for deployment on resource-constrained edge precise and efficient irrigation scheduling.
The seamless integration of ML-generated insights with IoT-enabled irrigation control systems requires the adoption of appropriate architectures and protocols that facilitate devices (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). Hardware lightweight, real-time communication. The Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT accelerators, such as GPUs and TPUs, provide specialized hardware designed for parallel processing) protocol and the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) are well-suited, enabling faster inference speeds and facilitating real-time data analysis (Premkumar for this purpose, offering efficient and reliable communication channels for exchanging data between sensors, & Sigappi, 2022). The combined utilization of these techniques can significantly improve the efficiency and responsiveness of real-time irrigation insight generation, contributing actuators, and ML models (Muangprathub et al., 2019; Osroosh et al., 2016). to the overall goal of achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.
The implementation MQTT's publish-subscribe architecture enables real-time data streaming and event- of these strategies and techniques for real-time generation of actionable irrigation insights provides a solid foundation for developing automated and data-driven irrigation management systems that can effectively addressdriven communication, while CoAP's lightweight design and low overhead make it suitable the global food challenge by optimizing water resource utilization and maximizing agricultural productivity.
for resource-constrained devices and low-bandwidth networks. By utilizing these protocols, irrigation systems can achieve seamless integration between ML models and IoT devices, enabling the automated application of irrigation insights based on real-time data and predictions.
Industry-leading products and services for smart irrigation demonstrate the practical application of these technologies. Smart irrigation controllers, such as Rachio, leverage weather data and soil moisture sensors to automatically adjust irrigation schedules based on real-time conditions, reducing water waste and promoting water conservation (Verdouw et al., 2023). Cloud-based irrigation management platforms, such as CropX, offer advanced analytics and decision support tools, providing farmers with insights into crop water requirements, soil health, and irrigation performance (Weikmann et al., 2023). These platforms often incorporate machine learning algorithms to generate predictive models and provide farmers with data-driven recommendations for optimizing irrigation strategies.
The analysis of these products and services highlights the growing trend toward data-driven, automated irrigation management. By integrating IoT, machine learning, and cloud computing, these solutions enable farmers to make more informed and efficient irrigation decisions, contributing to the overall goal of achieving sustainable and productive agriculture.

Abstract
Water, energy and food are important for human survival and sustainable development. 
With climate change, investigating climate change impacts on Water-Energy-Food nexus 
has been a topic of growing interest in recent years. However, there is a lack of a systematic 
review of the current state and methodologies of Water-Energy-Food nexus studies under 
climate change. Here, we review research articles investigating climate change impacts on 
Water-Food, Water-Energy and Water-Energy-Food nexus over last seven years. The exist-
ing methods and tools, spatial scales, and future climate scenarios setting in these arti-
cles are summarised and analysed. We found that the analyses methods could be divided 
into four categories (physics-based modelling, statistical methods, supervised learning and 
operation optimisation), among them, physics-based modelling accounts for the largest 
proportion. The reviewed studies cover a range of scales from site scale to global, with 
most studies focusing on the regional scale. Models used for small to middle scale are 
mainly related to hydrology and water resource, while large-scale modelling is based on 
interdisciplinary models. Future climate scenarios setting include emission scenarios and 
global warming scenarios based on Global Climate Models (GCMs). A number of future 
research challenges have been identified. These include spatial scale and resolution, inter-
nal physical mechanism, application of novel artificial intelligence models, extreme cli-
mate events, potential competition in nexus systems as well as data and model uncertainty.

1 Introduction
Water, energy and food are three essential resources that human beings depend upon for 
survival and development. These three resources are interconnected in complex ways 
(Liang et al. 2020), necessitating a holistic approach to their evaluation. The Water-Energy-
Food nexus concept was formally introduced in the Bonn 2011 Nexus Conference (Hoff 
2011) as an integrated system that encapsulates the interdependencies between water, 
energy and food (Conway et al. 2015; Scanlon et al. 2017).

The global temperature is likely to increase to 4.8℃ by 2100 compared to 1995–2014 
in the high-emission scenario (IPCC 2021). The increased temperature may lead to more 
frequent extreme and compound events such as heatwaves and long-term droughts, which 
could significantly affect constrain food production and energy generation. Climate change 
may pose great uncertainties and risks to water security, energy security and food security 
in the future. Therefore, understanding climate change impacts on water, energy and food 
is crucial for achieving the SDG6 (clean water and sanitation), SDG7 (affordable and clean 
energy) and SDG2 (zero hunger) (Liu et al. 2018; UN 2018).
Significant efforts have been made to explore and evaluate the Water-Energy-Food 
nexus via various approaches (de Amorim et al. 2018; D’Odorico et al. 2018; Endo et al. 
2020). Mannan et al. (2018) identified the capabilities and hindrances of applying the Life 
Cycle assessment on Water-Energy-Food nexus. Zhang et al. (2018) discussed the pros and 
cost of eight quantitative methods. Albrecht et al. (2018) emphasised the importance of 
integrating quantitative and qualitative methods with social science in studies that incor-
porate multiple methods. Zhang et al. (2019a) categorised eleven existing nexus methods 
and tools into three types according to research purposes. Namany et al. (2019) introduced 
three dynamic decision-making tools and proposed application examples during three deci-
sion-making process stages.
However, none of those reviews has analysed the methods and tools used for investigating 
climate change impacts to water, energy, and food. Several questions remain unanswered: 
What are existing state-of-the-art analytical methods and tools for studying Water-Energy-
Food under climate change? Which ones are more widely used? What are their features 
and limitations? What is the focus of related research on different spatial scales and topics? 
How should models be selected according to research topic and spatial scale? How does the 
related research consider climate change scenarios? What are future prospects?
To address these questions, we have reviewed and analysed research articles published 
over the past seven years that investigated climate change impacts on Water-Food, Water-
Energy and Water-Energy-Food nexus. Promising methods frequently used in each type of 
study, topics and models for different spatial scales, and climate change scenarios setting 
methods are identified and discussed. The research challenges and limitations are identi-
fied, suggesting potential directions for future research in the domain of Water-Energy-
Food interactions under climate change.
2  Methods
We searched peer-reviewed journal articles on the subject of climate change in the Web of 
Science database that were published after 2017 and related to Water-Food, Water-Energy 
and Water-Energy-Food. The article selection procedure followed Preferred Reporting 
Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA, Page et al. 2021), and the 
flow chart of the selection process is shown in Fig. 1.
2.1  Review Process
In Web of Science, we used ‘climate change’, ‘water’, ‘food’ and’irrigation’ as the key-
words to search the abstract, title and keywords of publications between 2017 and 2022, 
1676 articles were found. By replacing the keywords with ‘climate change’, ‘soil moisture’ 
and ‘crop yield’, 1155 articles were selected; when searching keywords ‘climate change

impacts on water and energy’, 5728 articles were found; and 2415 articles were listed 
through keywords ‘climate change’, ‘water’, ‘energy’ and ‘food’. Altogether, 10,974 arti-
cles were selected after the initial search.
2.2  Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
Articles that met all the following criteria were selected: (1) they contain Water-Food, 
Water-Energy or Water-Energy-Food, but do not consider water, energy or food separately; 
(2) the consider climate change impacts; and (3) they use quantitative analytical tools or 
models for assessment. Besides, eleven articles published in 2023 were added during the 
revision of the paper.
Based on these criteria, we obtained 45 articles related to Water-Food and climate 
change, identified 64 articles studying climate change impacts on Water-Energy, and 
selected 36 articles about climate change and Water-Energy-Food nexus. Thus, a total of 
145 articles were identified as suitable.
2.3  Information Extraction
After full-text reading of the 145 relevant articles, we extracted the following information: 
(1) the purpose of the study (2) the scale of study area; (3) methods used in the study area, 
based on statistical methods, physics-based modelling, supervised learning or operation

optimisation; (4) whether the article used models, combined multiple models or used a 
single model; (5) whether the article claimed a new method; (6) whether there was a simu-
lation under future scenarios and how the scenarios were set up; and (7) characteristics, 
major challenges and limitations in the application of methods and models.
3  Diversity of Nexus Methods
Numerous and diverse methods have been used or proposed for evaluating climate change 
impacts on Water-Food, Water-Energy and Water-Energy-Food nexus. while some studies have 
combined multiple methods. In this review, we divided the approaches into four categories: Sta-
tistical methods, Physics-based modelling, Supervised learning and Operation optimisation.
Methods based on statistics such as formula calculations, regression and statistical tests 
were grouped into Statistical methods; methods using models based on the representa-
tion of physical mechanisms were grouped into Physics-based modelling; methods using 
machine learning to do simulation were classified into Supervised learning; and methods 
using optimisation algorithm to determine optimal solution under constraints were classi-
fied into Operation optimisation.
3.1  Water‑Food Nexus Analysis Methods
In the Water-Food nexus research, 53% of studies (24 of 45) used statistical methods, 64% 
(29 of 45) used physics-based modelling methods and 9% (4 of 45) used operation optimi-
sation methods. We tabulate and categorise Water-Food analytical methods and tools from 
the selected 45 articles based on method categorisation and discipline in Table 1.
Studies investigating the influence of climate change on Water-Food nexus mainly 
focused on how climate change may impact water availability for irrigation, soil moisture 
and crop yield. Most Water-Food studies utilised multiple methods or coupled models from 
different disciplines. The input data of the models were commonly multidisciplinary from 
the areas of meteorology (precipitation, temperature, wind speed, humidity, solar radiation, 
etc.), environment  (CO2 concentration, etc.), geospatial (vegetation, landuse, etc.), eco-
nomics (GDP, etc.) and society (population, etc.).
Generally, in model coupling studies, a hydrological model was used to simulate runoff 
or soil moisture, and an agricultural model or a statistical calculation method was used to 
calculate irrigation water requirements and parameters related to crop yields. For example, 
Akoko et al. (2020) used Soil & Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to estimate the current 
and future water resources availability and Cropwat to calculate irrigation water require-
ments. Meanwhile, many interdisciplinary models were developed to study the Water-Food 
nexus. Blanc et al. (2017) integrated water resources model and a crop yield reduction mod-
ule into the Integrated Global System Modelling framework (IGSM) to assess the influence 
of climate and socioeconomic changes on irrigation water availability as well as subsequent 
impacts on crop yields by 2050. Malek et al. (2018) integrated a process-based irrigation 
module into VICCropSyst to assess the influence of climate change on irrigation losses.
Some model-based studies only utilised a single discipline model or a series of equa-
tions. This kind of research mostly focused on soil moisture, irrigation and crop parameters 
rather than simulations of water availability. He et al. (2021) projected the amount of agri-
cultural water for food production during peak population period (2029–2033) based on a 
series of equations including FAO’s Penman–Monteith equation. Jha et al. (2020) utilised

DSSAT to project the changes in rice yield, water demand and phenological growth due to 
climate change.
A small number of studies did not use or depend on models but used statistical methods 
to analyse climate change impacts on Water-Food nexus. Zhang et al. (2020) distinguished 
the different effects of climate change, planted area crop mix on irrigation water demand 
based on the LMDI method. Kirby et al. (2017) analysed the historical trends of water 
use, crop production, food availability and population growth, and project them forward to 
2050. Madadgar et al. (2017) developed a multivariate probabilistic model to estimate the 
probability distribution of crop yields under projected climate conditions.
Operation optimisation methods were less used in the climate change impacts on Water-
Food studies, in which more studies using nonlinear optimisation framework (Mitchell 
et al. 2017; Gohar and Cashman 2018). These studies optimised water or food related strat-
egies under climate change conditions.
3.2  Water‑Energy Nexus Analysis Methods
In the Water-Energy nexus research, 33% of studies (21 of 64) used statistical methods, 
92% (59 of 64) used physics-based modelling methods, 25% (16 of 64) used operation 
optimisation methods, and 9% (6 of 64) used supervised learning methods. Most stud-
ies utilised models and hydrological models accounted for a large part. The catalogue of 
Water-Energy analytical methods and tools from the selected 64 articles are tabulated and 
categorised based on method categorization and discipline in Table 2.
Studies analysing climate change impacts on Water-Energy mainly focused on hydro-
power. Hydropower is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change due to its direct depend-
ence on the timing and magnitude of streamflow. Most studies projected future hydropower 
generation to evaluate how climate change will affect energy production, or optimised the 
reservoir operation schemes to minimise the impacts of climate change on streamflow. 
Generally, hydrological models or supervised learning were adopted to simulate and pro-
ject future streamflow/inflow to hydropower reservoirs, then energy models or equations 
were employed to calculate potential hydropower generation, optimisation algorithms or 
water management models were employed to solve the optimal reservoir operation. For 
example, Rahmati et  al. (2021) simulated future runoff with Artificial Neural Network 
(ANN) and optimised hydropower generation by Grasshopper Optimisation Algorithm 
(GOA). Guo et al. (2021) used Genetic Algorithm (GA) to solve the robust optimisation 
model with the inflows simulated by SWAT under climate and land use change scenarios 
in the future. Anghileri et al. (2018) contributed a modelling framework combining hydro-
logical modelling, hydropower modelling and multi-objective optimisation technique to 
assess climate change and energy policies impacts on the operations of hydropower reser-
voir systems in the Alps.
Meanwhile, a small number of studies used interdisciplinary models to study Water-
Energy nexus. Miara et al. (2017) simulated river discharge and temperature as well as 
electricity generation under climate change using the coupled Water Balance Model and 
Thermoelectric Power and Thermal Pollution Model (WBM TP2M). Graham et al. (2020) 
utilised Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM) to investigate the relative contribu-
tions of climate and human systems on water scarcity regionally and globally.

3.3  Water‑Energy‑Food Nexus Analysis Methods
There are relatively fewer selected studies about evaluating climate change impacts on 
Water-Energy-Food nexus. In the selected research, 36% of studies (13 of 36) used sta-
tistical methods, 78% (28 of 36) used physics-based modelling methods, 36% (13 of 36) 
used operation optimisation methods, and 6% (2 of 36) used supervised learning. Most 
studies evaluated climate change impacts on Water-Energy-Food through physics-based 
modelling, among them most utilised interdisciplinary models with the proportion of 44%. 
Besides, many studies in Water-Energy-Food utilised operation optimisation method. The 
catalogue of Water-Energy-Food analytical methods and tools from the selected 36 articles 
are tabulated and categorised in Table 3.
Studies investigating climate change impacts on Water-Energy-Food nexus can be divided 
into three categories: (1) simulations of future Water-Energy-Food nexus change under future 
climate change scenarios, (2) optimal management options for mitigating future climate 
change impacts, (3) historical attribution or trend analysis of climate change impacts.
For future simulation research, studies generally utilised interdisciplinary models or 
coupled different models from multiple disciplines. Sridhar et al. (2021) presented an inte-
grated modelling framework combining Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) and System 
Dynamics (SD) model for analysing the impacts of future climate on irrigation, hydro-
power, and other supply and demand through a feedback loop. Yang et al. (2018) adopted 
a two-way coupled agent-based model (ABM-SWAT) to evaluate the water availability for 
irrigation, hydropower generation, and riverine ecosystem health under joint effect of cli-
mate change and water infrastructure development.
Operation optimisation research mainly focused on addressing complex contradictions 
of Water-Energy-Food nexus to find an optimal strategy and aid sustainable development. 
Optimisation programming was used in this kind of research, sometimes combining phys-
ics-based modelling, supervised learning or statistical methods. Yuan et al. (2018) inte-
grated Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and linear programming to assess the feasibility of 
bioenergy and consider future circumstances under climate change impacts. Giuliani et al. 
(2022) combined HBV hydrological model, ANN and evolutionary multi-objective direct 
policy search method to demonstrate how local dynamics across Water-Energy-Food sys-
tems are impacted by climate change mitigation policies.
Research focused on historical trend utilised statistical methods to analyse datasets. 
Barik et al. (2017) investigated the Water-Energy-Food nexus in India under drought and 
monsoon rainfall in the last few decades based on GLDAS and GRACE data.
4  Studies for Different Spatial Scales
According to spatial scale of study area, these selected studies were categorised into large 
scale studies and small to middle scale studies. The research objectives and typical models 
of each scale and topic of research are summarised in Table 4. The selected studies related 
to Water-Food and Water-Energy occupy a higher proportion, while research on water-
energy-food is relatively less. This is because the research on this topic involves more inter-
disciplinary science, so related research is not easy to conduct. Besides there were fewer 
studies of water-energy-food at global and national scales than at regional scales, because 
the larger the study area, the more complex the water-energy-food nexus is, the access to 
the required data also becomes more difficult.

Water-Energy-Food studies at the global scale focused on the competition for water 
between energy and food. The interlinkages between water, energy and food sectors were 
explored more in small to middle scale studies. Meanwhile, there were many more optimi-
sations and policy scenarios in research at the regional scale. The Water-Energy research 
at large scale mainly focused on the impacts of river flow on potential hydropower produc-
tion, while the optimisation of hydropower system operation is also concerned at small-
middle scale research. The focuses of Water-Food research at large and small-middle 
scale were similar, mainly investigating the water management and crop production strate-
gies. Local water, energy and food management strategies may not be applicable to other 
regions, so the trade-off between water, energy and food under climate change and the 
strategies for sustainable development at a larger scale still require continuous efforts from 
the academic community.
The findings on the global scale may inform future research at different scales. For 
Water-Energy research, roughly 65% of the world’s current hydropower capacity will 
face vulnerabilities due to alterations in the 1-in-100-year river flow pattern (Paltán et al. 
2021), the most prominent encompassing Europe, northern Africa, the Middle East, and 
North America (Turner et al. 2017; Paltán et al. 2021). Pursuing a 1.5 °C warming target 
would mitigate these risks when contrasted with a 2.0 °C scenario (Paltán et al. 2021). For 
Water-Food research, a projected food deficit might occur prior to 2050 in the scenario 
of the worst-case climate change, significant water shortages stemming from irrigation in 
major food-producing nations will hinder these countries from satisfying their domestic 
food needs (Grafton et al. 2017). An expansion of irrigated land by 100 Mha would be 
necessary to double food production to meet the projected global food demands by 2050, 
and an additional 10% to 20% of trade flow will be required, directing water-abundant 
regions toward water-scarce regions, to maintain environmental flow requirements (Pastor 
et al. 2019). Expanding irrigation will lead to increased maize production in Europe, but 
the same cannot be said for rice production in East Asia (Okada et al. 2018). In a scenario 
of 3 °C warming, a "soft-path" approach with small water storage and deficit irrigation 
can extend irrigated land by 70 Mha and feed additional 300 million people worldwide, 
a "hard-path" with substantial annual water storage has the potential to expand irrigation 
up to 350 Mha and feed 1.4 billion more people (Rosa et al. 2020). The regions that heav-
ily rely on snowmelt as an agricultural water resource are high-mountain regions like the 
Tibetan Plateau, Central Asia, western Russia, the western United States, and the southern  
Andes (Qin et  al. 2020b). For Water-Energy-Food research, water scarcity reductions 
driven by human is likely to result in 44% of land area in the world by the end of twenty-
first century in certain socioeconomic scenarios (Graham et al. 2020). An additional 1.7 
billion people could potentially experience severe water shortages for electricity, industrial 
use, and household needs if priority becomes for food production and maintaining environ-
mental flow (de Vos et al. 2021).
4.1  Models for Medium to Small Spatial Scale
Watershed hydrological models can be categorised into three types: (1) conceptual mod-
els, (2) physics-based models, and (3) data driven models. Conceptual hydrological models 
are based on physical basis but are in highly simplified forms, they also have the charac-
teristics of statistical regression models (e.g., HBV and Xinanjiang model). The biggest 
limitation is that they treat the watershed as a whole, ignoring the heterogeneity of spa-
tially distributed watershed characteristic parameters (Devia et  al.  2015). Physics-based 
29
A Systematic Review of Methods for Investigating Climate Change…

models adopt spatially varied parameters to reflect the physical mechanism of hydrologi-
cal process influenced by multiple factors (e.g., SWAT and HEC-HMS). The data-driven 
models establish statistical relationships between input and output. They work well at the 
data range, but the simulation performance degrades when applied to epitaxial projection 
because of the lack of physical basis. Over the past decade, a cutting-edge machine learn-
ing methodology, named deep learning, has evolved from the traditional neural network 
and has outperformed traditional models with considerable improvement in performance 
(Yuan et al. 2020). However, deep learning cannot completely replace the physics-based 
models, and the combination of physics-based models and deep learning may open a prom-
ising door (Yuan et al. 2020).
Water management models aim to optimise water allocation to fulfil the demands from 
multiple sectors. Many selected studies established optimisation frameworks for planning 
and management of water resources. There were some studies employing existing water 
management models directly, among which WEAP and HEC-ResSim were most used. 
Crop models are used to simulate crop growth, DSSAT and CropSyst are typical and most 
common used crop models in selected studies. TIMES and LEAP were relatively fre-
quently employed in investigating climate change impacts on water and energy. Interdisci-
plinary models like ABM, SD model and WEF Nexus Tool 2.0 were utilised in the Water-
Energy-Food nexus studies.
4.2  Models for Large Spatial Scale
Global hydrological models consider more land surface processes like recycling of evapo-
transpiration. The approach integrates knowledge from multiple disciplines encompassing 
atmospheric sciences, geography, ecology, oceanography, soil science, global change sci-
ence, etc. All global hydrological models run in a grid format (Sood and Smakhtin 2015). 
Typical global-scale hydrological models used in selected studies include WBM, VIC, 
WaterGAP and LPJmL. Different models have different emphases and characteristics. For 
example, WaterGAP model is more detailed in water demand simulation including water 
use for domestic, industry, thermal power production, livestock and irrigation (Döll et al. 
2003). LPJmL model puts more emphasis on vegetation and crop simulations (Bondeau 
et al. 2007). High degree of uncertainty and rough resolution are main limitations of global 
hydrological models (Sood and Smakhtin 2015).
In selected global-scale studies investigating climate change impacts on Water-Food, 
GCWM and GFWS were utilised. GCWM mainly focuses on blue and green consump-
tive water use as well as virtual water of 23 specific crops (Siebert and Döll 2010). GFWS 
puts more attention on global food and irrigated water availability risks through simulation 
of food generation and demand, water supply and agricultural water requirement (Grafton 
et al. 2015).
Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) are important tools to evaluate human feedback 
and impacts on climate change and mitigation of greenhouse gases (Schwanitz 2013). The 
IGSM framework consists primarily of two interacting components (Sokolov et al. 2018): 
the Economic Projection and Policy Analysis model and the Earth System model. GCAM 
links water, energy, landuse, earth systems and economics to analyse consequences of pol-
icy strategies and interdependencies. IMAGE simulates interactions between biosphere, 
society and the climate system to assess environmental and sustainable development issues. 
Delimitation of the system, explanatory power of models, as well as linkage of model eval-
uation and usefulness are the main challenges for IAMs (Schwanitz 2013).

5  Future Climate Scenarios Setting Methods
Most selected research assessed and projected future water, energy and food systems based on 
future climate change models. The emission scenarios, climate models, downscaling methods 
and global warming scenarios in selected articles are summarised and introduced below.
5.1  Emissions Scenarios
For climate change impacts assessment, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC) has published Assessment Reports (AR) on climate change based on greenhouse 
gas emissions scenarios. Future climate projections in the IPCC Fourth Assessment 
Report (AR4, IPCC 2007) were based on Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES, 
IPCC  2000) and simulations of the third phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison 
Project (CMIP3, Meehl et al. 2005). SRES was superseded by Representative Concentra-
tion Pathways (RCPs) in the IPCC fifth assessment report (AR5, IPCC 2014) based on the 
CMIP5 (Taylor et al. 2012).
The IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6, IPCC 2021) assessed the future climate out-
comes based on the combination of socio-economic (SSP1-SSP5) and future radiative forc-
ing scenarios (1.9 to 8.5 W/m2), which called Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs). 
The latest SSPs can quantitatively describe the relationship between socioeconomic devel-
opment and global climate change to reflect the climate change challenges that society will 
face in the future (Eyring et al. 2016). Basically, some older studies (generally in 2017 and 
2018) used SRES of CIMIP3 models. Most selected studies utilised RCPs of CMIP5 mod-
els. Some post-2020 studies were starting to use SSPs from CMIP6.
5.2  Climate Models and Downscaling Methods
Global climate model (GCM) is capable and useful for projecting future climate (Overland 
et al. 2011). Many research institutions have developed GCMs based on their own experiment 
assumptions and mathematical representations of physical climate system.
Studies at global scale in this review inputted GCMs directly into global models to pro-
ject climate change impacts (Turner et al. 2017; Pastor et al. 2019). However, GCMs are 
generally insufficient to provide useful climate predictions on the local to regional scales 
because of relatively coarse resolution and significant uncertainties in the modelling pro-
cess (Allen and Ingram 2002; Dibike and Coulibaly  2005). When the climate change 
impacts studies are carried out at local and regional scales, downscaling methods have 
been developed to overcome the mismatch of spatial resolution between GCMs and models 
(Hwang and Graham 2013).
Downscaling techniques are categorised by two approaches (Hwang and Graham 2013):
1. Statistical downscaling using the empirical relationship between GCMs simulated fea-
tures at the grid scale and surface observations at the sub-grid scale. For example, Bias-
Correction Spatial Disaggregation (BCSD, e.g., Zhao et al. 2022) and the Statistical 
Downscaling Model (SDSM, e.g., Goodarzi et al. 2020) were employed to downscale 
GCMs in the selected studies.
2. Dynamic downscaling using regional climate models (RCMs) based on physical rela-
tions between the climate parameters at large and smaller scale.
31
A Systematic Review of Methods for Investigating Climate Change…
1 3
Most selected articles using dynamic downscaling method generally applied results from 
the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX). CORDEX was 
to create an enhanced modelling framework for generating climate projections at regional 
scales, enabling impact assessments and adaptation studies globally within the IPCC AR5 
(Giorgi et al. 2022).
5.3  Global Warming Scenarios
The Paris Agreement (UNFCCC 2015) aims to keep global mean surface air temperature 
increasing below 2℃ relatives to pre-industrial levels and targets to limit it to 1.5℃. Some 
articles simulated future Water-Food or Water-Energy under global warming 1.5℃, 2℃, 
3℃ or 4℃ (Donk et al. 2018; Sylla et al. 2018; Meng et al. 2020; Qin et al. 2020b; Rosa 
et al. 2020; Zhao et al. 2021b). These studies utilised two approaches (James et al. 2017) to  
assess the regional implications of different degrees of warming: (1) time sampling; (2) 
pattern scaling.
In time sampling approach, the global warming scenarios are derived by extracting a 
period of time (usually 30 years) when the driving climate model projects an increase of 
specified degrees (e.g., 1.5℃ and 2℃) of warming compared to the pre-industrial level 
(Sylla et al. 2018).
Pattern scaling assumes the relationship between global mean temperature and local 
change is linear (Huntingford and Cox 2000; Mitchell 2003; James et al. 2017). These pat-
terns can scale changes in global mean annual temperature to local and seasonal changes 
for climate variables by linear regressions (Qin et al. 2020b).
6  Directions of Future Research and Prospects
Future challenges in climate change and nexus research are identified from five aspects: 
(1) scale and resolution of study area; (2) internal physical mechanism; (3) extreme climate 
events; (4) potential competition between sectors; (5) data and model uncertainty.
6.1  Scale and Resolution of Study Area
Most selected studies related to climate change impacts on Water-Food generally focused 
on watershed, regional and national scale, the analyses not only focused on temporal differ-
ences but also spatial difference according to different geographical resolution. In contrast, 
studies investigating climate change impacts on Water-Energy mainly analysed hydro-
power, therefore, results were generally shown within hydropower plants, dams and res-
ervoirs without spatial difference. Evaluation studies of climate change impacts on Water-
Energy-Food nexus mainly focused on basin and regional scale, the analysis put water, 
energy, and food into a whole system, but the spatial resolution was often ignored.
It is of great significance for local sustainability management and decision-making to 
study climate change impacts on Water-Energy-Food on basin and regional scale, but the 
results may be limited by the boundaries of the study area. For example, the simulated 
streamflow at the outlet of the study basin is not necessarily the amount of water available 
in the basin because the water demands in the downstream regions should be considered. 
The absence of water, energy and food scheduling with other regions may have effects on 
 32
D. Gao et al.

inaccurate supply and demand simulations, further resulting in inaccurate management 
strategies. The water transport routes of water resources are sometimes cross-watershed. 
For example, reservoirs or weirs provide for agriculture, industry, or domestic use through 
their own pipeline systems. With the impact of climate change, economic globalization and 
other strong human activities, local Water-Energy-Food nexus is bound to be influenced by 
global hydrological cycle and non-local human activities. It requires scholars to understand 
local nexus relationships from a large-scale perspective.
Meanwhile, considering climate change has obvious spatial differences, and the 
response speed of different regions to climate change is also different, the climate change 
impacts study on Water-Energy-Food nexus with geographical resolution can show spatial 
difference of water, energy, food change due to climate change and provide a better refer-
ence for sustainability management.
6.2  Internal Physical Mechanisms in Modelling
Most of the studies about evaluating climate change impacts on Water-Food and Water-
Energy considered hydrological processes based on physical mechanisms. Research on 
Water-Energy-Food and climate change impacts consisted of interdisciplinary and transdis-
ciplinary analysis, while the complexity of the system leads to the simplification of many 
physical mechanisms. Many mathematical or data-driven models were used for inves-
tigating climate change impacts on Water-Energy-Food, but the lack of internal physical 
mechanisms cannot well explain the interactive process between water, energy and food to 
climate change.
Future research needs to understand the interlinkages and internal physical mechanisms 
of the nexus sectors and climate change. Meanwhile, science and policy should be inte-
grated to reveal the dynamics of natural processes along with social processes.
6.3  Novel Artificial Intelligence Models
Many selected studies employed Artificial Intelligence (AI) in simulation and operation 
optimisation. Feedforward and feedback neural networks were used for simulation. Most 
selected studies used programming and meta-heuristic algorithms, and a small number 
used reinforcement learning for operation optimisation. In recent years, with the rapid 
development of AI, many novel AI models have been proposed repeatedly. These AI mod-
els will provide a feasible direction for these complex interdisciplinary sciences. For exam-
ple, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) was developed by combining traditional reinforce-
ment learning with deep learning, and it is capable of handling high-dimensional states and 
actions (Mnih et al. 2015). DRL has been applied for optimal hydropower reservoir opera-
tion (Xu et al. 2020), irrigation optimisation (Alibabaei et al. 2022) and water-energy-food 
nexus security assessment (Raya-Tapia et al. 2023). The application of DRL on complex 
water-energy-food system under climate change is still to be investigated.
6.4  Extreme Climate Events
Most projections of future nexus were generally based on temporal continuous climate 
change scenarios, only few reviewed studies have considered extreme weather events. 
33
A Systematic Review of Methods for Investigating Climate Change…
1 3
Climate change will increase the intensity, frequency and spatial extent of extreme cli-
mate events (Hasegawa et al. 2021) and compound hazards (Zscheischler et al. 2018). 
More frequent and extreme events will cause disruptions in the management of water, 
energy, and food (Núñez-López et al. 2022). For example, relative to moderate-level 
climate change, an additional 20–36% population may face hunger under a 1-in-100 yr 
extreme climate event under RCP8.5 (Hasegawa et  al. 2021). Compound hazards 
will cause devastating impacts at a scale far beyond any single disaster in isolation 
(Zscheischler et al. 2018). For example, increasing compound drought–heatwave risks 
may affect 90% of the global population and gross domestic product in the future (Yin 
et al. 2023). Considering the water, energy and food relationship under extreme climate 
events in any future studies has an important role in developing strategies to ensure 
water, energy and food security.
6.5  Potential Competition Between Sectors
Previous studies related to climate change impacts on Water-Food and Water-Energy did 
not consider competition between subsystems because there was no/limited competi-
tion between two sectors in early days. When considering three sectors together, com-
petition arises. Competition for water between food and energy sectors is an important 
part of the Water-Energy-Food nexus (Qin 2021). The competitive relationship is not 
conducive to the sustainable development. For example, the average total production 
water footprint in 31 provinces of the Chinese Mainland in the Industry Competition 
Unsustainability scenario reached 4.08  m3/kg in 2016 (Hua et al. 2022). Considering the 
economic and social situation, energy production is more profitable than food, so water 
flows easily into the energy sector. Especially in the context of climate change, water 
availability is greatly affected. How to ensure food and energy security within limited 
water resources context should be considered in any future studies.
6.6  Data and Model Uncertainty
In the evaluation of climate change impacts on Water-Energy-Food, numerous data from 
multiple disciplines including meteorology, agriculture, environment, hydrology, eco-
nomics, society are needed. The use of different data sets, mismatch of data resolu-
tion, the varying quality and availability of data (Perrone et al. 2011), and assumptions 
and simplifications introduced to deal with data scarcity could lead to very different 
results. High uncertainty may be caused to exert negative impacts on the nexus analysis 
and even misrepresent the interactions among nexus sectors (Zhang et al. 2018). What 
is more, models and analysis tools also introduce uncertainty. Downscaling of future 
meteorological data, numerous parameters in modelling, limited understanding of nexus 
processes, the intrinsic indeterminism of complex dynamic systems, and myriad future 
scenarios will bring uncertainty into final results, making it difficult to identify an opti-
mal policy choice (Gallopín et al. 2001; Antón et al. 2013; Yung et al. 2019).
Endeavours should be made in future studies to identify, analyse and reduce uncer-
tainty in data use and modelling for nexus research to increase the reliability of projec-
tion results and build capacity for decision-making in the context of uncertainty.

7  Conclusions
This paper provides a systematic review on the analytical approaches in the evaluation of 
climate change impacts on Water-Food, Water-Energy and Water-Energy-Food. The key 
findings are summarised as below:
1. Analytical methodologies used in selected research can be classified into four catego-
ries: Statistical methods, Physics-based modelling, Supervised learning and Operation 
optimisation. Catalogues of methods used in the evaluation of climate change impacts 
on Water-Food, Water-Energy and Water-Energy-Food are listed respectively based on 
the classification (see Tables 1, 2 and 3). Such catalogues are helpful to clearly show 
popular and promising methods in selected studies.
2. The focus of research on different topics at different scales are discussed. Large scale 
and medium-small scale models are introduced in terms of their characteristics, limita-
tions, providing references for selection of models and issues to consider when using 
the models. Some models are applicable for different scales but there is no single model 
suitable for all scales. The classification and discussion of topics and models is help-
ful to provide guidance on appropriate model selection by considering research scales, 
objectives and themes (Water-Food, Water-Energy and Water-Energy-Food).
3. Future climate scenarios setting including emission scenarios, climate models, down-
scaling methods and global warming scenarios are summarised. Climate scenarios are 
important for simulating interactions between water, energy and food under various 
future climate change conditions, as well as exploring the effectiveness of mitigation 
measures or policies. The study has provided references for the setting of climate sce-
narios and processing of future meteorological data in future research.
4. Despite significant efforts were made in investigating climate change impacts on Water-
Energy-Food, limitations of current research still exist, and the challenges for future 
study are discussed. Current studies do not adequately address the uncertainties gener-
ated by data and models. Research about extreme climate events and potential compe-
tition in nexus systems is not sufficient. Efforts can be made in the internal physical 
mechanisms analysis, application of novel artificial intelligence models and spatial 
differences analysis of nexus issues.

The concept of integrated production system (IPS) has been thus designed to solve those issues and also to meet the need for better food quality and production. Methodologies such as agronomic diagnosis-based design, prototyping, and model-based design have been developed. Here we review the model-based design of IPS. We identify tools for the development of comprehensive models. Once comprehensive models have been developed, model-based design of IPS can be formulated as an optimization problem to be solved using different approaches. Thus, we review the choice of corresponding criteria, constraints, and mathematical formulations found in the literature. We analyze successful model-based design in transportation and drug development. We learn from these areas to overcome the inherent difficulties involved in the model-based design of IPS. We recommend the following major points: IPS model-based design should use integrative modeling platforms, process-oriented modeling, and object-oriented techniques to improve the genericity, modularity, reuse of crop models, and the data sharing. The spatial dimension of IPS has to be accounted for by making crop models spatially explicit. The design evaluation criteria have to be standardized and carefully chosen by promoting stakeholders involvement. The design of IPS should be formulated as a multiobjective optimization problem, for which non-aggregative approaches should be preferred. Finally, it is necessary to establish a true dialogue between prototyping and model-based design practitioners in order to test, and if necessary to improve, the proposed systems.

Intensive agriculture is considered by politicians as one of the greatest sources of pollution and has led to major environmental problems that affect global sustainability. Today, farmers must comply with an increasing number of regulations, especially concerning the use of pesticides. Within this context, the requirements of food quality and of regularity of production force us to consider all the possible alternatives for limiting the development of pests while ensuring economic and environmental sustainability. 1.2 Context of integrated protection and emergence of integrated production The development of pest resistance and the negative environmental impacts of pesticides are some of the serious problems caused by the excessive use of pesticides. They have motivated the development of new system approaches and techniques in pest management (Kropff et al. 2001). Approaches have changed from the exclusion or destruction of pests by an intensive use of pesticides to the use of alternative control methods that involve many interlinked components within the agroecosystem. According to Boller et al. (2004), experts have distinguished four steps in the development of plant protection. The first one is blind chemical control characterized by routine applications of the most powerful pesticides, following industrial recommendations. The second one is integrated chemical control consisting of the applications of broad-spectrum pesticides, in general, after consultation with an advisory service. The third one is specific control based on the introduction of the concept of “economic threshold levels” and the application of pesticides with no negative side effects and the protection of beneficial organisms. Integrated pest management is the last step. In addition to the third step, it integrates biological and biotechnical methods and good agricultural practices while severely restricting the use of chemical products (Boller et al. 2004). According to Walton et al. (1995), “Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a pest management system that in the socioeconomic context of cropping systems, the associated environment and the population dynamics of the pest species, utilizes all suitable techniques in as compatible manner as possible and maintains the pest population levels below those causing economic injury.”. Integrated pest management is simply one step in a more ambitious and holistic approach, i.e., integrated production. According to the IOBC definition: “Integrated Production/Farming is a farming system that produces high quality food and other products by using natural resources and regulating mechanisms to replace polluting inputs and to secure sustainable farming.” The design of innovative farming systems or cropping systems, as they are most often referred to in the literature, that address the problems of integrated production has now become an important international issue (Gary 2004; Tixier et al. 2008). 1.3 Model-based design of integrated production systems versus other approaches The design of innovative cropping systems is a very difficult problem (Antonopoulou 2003). It generally starts with an evaluation phase of the existing systems. Innovation can then focus on improving system management or on its partial or total reconfiguration (Loyce and Wery 2006). According to Loyce and Wery (2006), the design of innovative cropping systems may be divided into three stages. The first one is the definition of a set of constraints and objectives for the systems to be built. The evaluation of existing cropping systems in the area studied and the analysis of farm performance and of farmers’ practices constitute fundamental approaches to provide the elements necessary to this phase. The second stage is the determination of combinations of innovative techniques or innovative crop successions. This stage is the design stage in the strict sense of the term and can be achieved based on agronomic diagnosis, on experts’ statements, or on models. The in situ or in silico evaluation of candidate combinations constitutes the third stage. We can add a fourth stage during which, based on the evaluation results, one or a few “potentially innovative” cropping systems are selected and disseminated. In this section, we focus our investigation on the design task. The agronomic diagnosis may be considered as the basis for the improvement of cropping systems. It allows us to identify risky production situations, to recognize the main factors that limit performance, and, thus, to identify the technical choices that make it possible to deal with these situations. However, the diagnosis is generally achieved only over a few years, the range of explored techniques is almost always limited to a particular region, and diagnosis is generally based on a small number of criteria. Diagnosis must therefore rely on complementary knowledge in order to be able to imagine the consequences of the proposed improvements with additional criteria and to achieve more complete proposals for innovative cropping systems (Loyce and Wery 2006). The “prototyping method” (Vereijken 1997) is advocated as an expert-based design approach. It is based on three steps: (1) construction by the experts of a cropping system, a “theoretical prototype”, satisfying a set of constraints and objectives; (2) experimental evaluation of this prototype in several situations representative of the constraints set; and (3) adaptation of this prototype based on the multicriteria assessment of the experimental results. Several iterations between the second and third phases result in an “engineering prototype” that can then be extensively tested or serve as a basis for the second phase of prototyping. This method can be very effective for promoting interdisciplinarity among researchers and for involving farmers from the start in a context where models are not available. However, prototyping has several drawbacks. First, the need for consensus on one or several prototypes may overlook many innovative combinations. Second, climate variability and other associated risks are difficult to take into account for each of the three phases mentioned above. Finally, the formalization and transparency of the design process are not always clear, making the process difficult for other experts to analyze (Loyce and Wery 2006). Field experimentation is very costly and time-consuming (Chatelin et al. 2007). Modeling is becoming increasingly more effective and useful with the advent of more powerful computers. Computer simulation models for agroecosystems are a representation or an abstract of reality, expressed in mathematical and logical terms. As such, they can never fully represent reality and are imperfect. Their use, however, has many advantages. These include manipulations and experiments that would be impractical, too expensive, too lengthy, or impossible in the real world, in addition to the identification of complex interactions in the real systems, rapid identification of the best management strategies, evaluation of the long-term effects of options, and investigation of hypothetical situations such as climate change (Mayer 2002). The use of models for designing integrated production systems (IPS) appears to be appropriate. According to Dogliotti et al. (2004), this approach may be considered as the adaptation and improvement of the prototyping approach (Dogliotti et al. 2004). Model-based design includes a development phase followed by an evaluation phase. The experiment, which is an essential component of the design and evaluation in the prototyping approach, has a very different role here. It comes after the “design”-in silico evaluation phases to confirm the relevance of the systems selected by the model, to test their robustness under various environmental conditions, and, finally, to assess their feasibility and therefore the relevance of the choice and dissemination of such systems (Loyce and Wery 2006; Blazy et al. 2010). 1.4 Model-based design of integrated production systems: the multi-criteria aspects Model-based design of IPS is faced with two major problems: exploring sustainability objectives of cropping systems and evaluating them. On the one hand, the full decision space of these objectives is usually very large, and simplifications are necessary to ensure computational feasibility (deVoil et al. 2006). On the other hand, evaluation, a very important task with respect to the implementation of integrated production systems, requires both the integration of a large quantity of information regarding economic, social, and environmental objectives and the treatment of conflicting aspects of these objectives as a function of the views and opinions of the individuals involved in the design process (Sadok et al. 2008). Multiobjective evaluation methods may be useful for discussion on tradeoffs between these conflicting objectives (Sadok et al. 2008). The design of integrated production systems must therefore be studied as a typical multi-criteria decision-making problem that could be handled by multiobjective optimization techniques. 1.5 Paper focus and organization This paper deals with the model-based design of integrated production systems. In the next section, we give a brief description of the necessary elements for this kind of design. We critically review the literature related to each of these elements in “Model-based design of integrated production systems: brief overview of the elements involved”. The section “Model-based design of integrated production systems: examples, comparison to other fields, and critical analysis” presents the design step itself and includes some examples of model-based design. Critical analysis and comparison between integrated production systems and other systems such as transportation and drug design are included in this section. In “Efficiency of model-based design”, we discuss the future of model-based design and the challenges to be overcome to make it more reliable. 2 Model-based design of integrated production systems: brief overview of the elements involved Agroecosystems are composed of many interacting entities, i.e., soil, cultivated plants, other biotic elements, and the environment, managed by the farmer (Fig. 1). These entities each behave in a certain way and form the system dynamics; the overall behavior emerges from the interaction between these entities (Dore et al. 2006; Akplogan et al. 2009). Many models and support tools are required to represent this inherent complexity and the different time and space scales of system operation. In this section, we attempt to list the most necessary models and tools for the model-based design of IPS. Crop models describing the growth and development of plants, models for simulating the effects of farmers’ management practices, models for predicting the emergence of pests, for evaluating their impacts, and for controlling them, models for genetic improvement of cultivated plants, and models for climate prediction are required. Model-based design also requires databases that describe field experiments, weather, soil characteristics, plant genotypes, pests, natural enemies, and economic data. Efficient multicriteria evaluation methods and powerful multiobjective optimization algorithms are also needed for the model-based design of IPS (Fig. 2).

GIS, Geographic Information System Full size image 2.1 Modeling crops, pests, and cropping systems 2.1.1 Crop models Many researchers have developed crop models since the pioneering works of the De Wit school at Wageningen University (Bouman et al. 1996; van Ittersum et al. 2003). These models may be divided into two main types: biophysical and decision models. The biophysical models represent the evolution of cultivated plants and describe the dynamic interactions between soil, plants, and the environment. Depending on the goals, a wide variety of biophysical models exist, ranging from conceptual models to develop understanding to more complex biophysical models such as STICS (Brisson et al. 2003), APSIM (Keating et al. 2003), CropSyst (Stockle et al. 2003), and DSSAT (Jones et al. 2003). The biophysical models provide useful indicators for decision models. The decision models describe the farmers’ decision-making process dynamics in broad terms of crop evolution, including pests and climate (Crespo 2006). They are defined as the conceptual models of farmers’ management and organizational practices, taking constraints into account and generating adequate actions. Examples include OTELO (Attonaty et al. 1990), DECIBLE (Aubry et al. 1998), MODERATO (Bergez et al. 2001), and DIESE (Martin-Clouaire and Rellier 2009). 2.1.2 Cultural practices modeling Management practices constitute the fundamental ingredient of farmers’ decisions and have direct and indirect impacts on plants and pests. They influence soil, plant, and pest status and, as a result, agronomic and environmental crop performances, but they are influenced by work organization and the social and economic context (Nesme et al. 2009). Their modeling is an important element in the model-based design approach of IPS. However, these practices are often empirically modeled in the case of most crop models even if researchers have extensively studied management practices, leading to little conceptual insight. This is due in part to the difficulty in describing these practices and their impact on the biophysical system since they have multiple and prolonged consequences on the crop system dynamics (Bergez et al. 2010). 2.1.3 Pest models and pest control models Few crop models integrate pests (Bergez et al. 2010). Among four of the best known and most commonly used crop models, namely STICS, APSIM, CropSyst, and DSSAT, only DSSAT explicitly takes pests into consideration. However, pest occurrence, plant performance, and plant damage caused by pests constitute the key elements of integrated production systems. Accordingly, the whole model-based design approach should rely on the modeling of the interaction between plants and pests (Kropff et al. 1995). Even if agronomists have ignored it, much research has been conducted on the biotic component of agroecosystems, and many researchers have proposed pest models. The approaches used range from knowledge representation formalisms such as expert systems to discrete events systems formalisms, including Lotka–Volterra predator–prey models. A number of these models have been developed for the identification of beneficial insects and pests and may be used for prevention purposes. Expert systems proposed by Mahaman et al. (2003) and by Gonzalez-Andujar (2009) belong to this category (Mahaman et al. 2003; Gonzalez-Andujar 2009). In addition, in order to quantify pest damage, models ranging from empirical functions that ignore the dynamics of crop–pest interactions to mechanistic simulation models that integrate the dynamics of a pest over the season have been proposed (Kropff et al. 1995). Other models have been dedicated to the development of pest management strategies. Munier-Jolain et al. (2005) and Colbach et al. (2007) developed DECID’Herb and ALOMYSYS, respectively, for weed control in crop production using empirical functions and a fuzzy logic expert system (Munier-Jolain et al. 2005; Colbach et al. 2007). Jerry and Gouzé (2004) and Mailleret and Grognard (2009) studied biological control problems using predator–prey models (see “Examples of model-based design”). Others researchers go further by taking the impacts of pest control on predators and beneficial insects into account. These works are essentially based on the Lotka–Volterra models. For example, Hall and Lescourret (2008) proposed a model of plant–pest–predator interactions with threshold control based on the biomass flow from plant to pest to predator. The objective of this study was to distinguish situations in which the application of control measures can disrupt the control of pests by predators (Hall and Lescourret 2008). Other less familiar modeling approaches have also been used for the development of pest management strategies. Thus, Leger and Naud (2009) proposed an expert-based IPM solution designed by a team of phytopathologist experts. They modeled the decision process by means of statecharts that belong to the family of discrete event systems formalisms (Leger and Naud 2009). The majority of the cited and available models, except those dealing with identification, focus on a single pest, although there is often a complex of pests on plants under real conditions. For example, exceptions include Willocquet et al. (2002) who proposed a model that simulates yield losses due to several rice pests (sheath blight, brown spot, sheath rot, bacterial leaf blight, stem borers, brown plant hopper, defoliating insects, and weeds) under a range of specific production situations found in tropical Asia. Nevertheless, as Bergez et al. (2010) observed, these aspects have not yet been sufficiently studied. 2.1.4 Model spatialization The spatial organization of crops could be considered as a management practice insofar as it is chosen, decided, and may be adapted by a farmer or by a farmer’s team. Spatial organization has a significant effect on pest dynamics that itself has a spatial dimension and on the effectiveness of the protection methods carried out by farmers. It has an important role to play in the design of IPS and should be better taken into account in the model-based design approach. However, most crop/pest models have been developed for studying temporal variations of processes and habitually ignore their spatial variation, with a few exceptions. The model outputs are therefore generally site specific. It is both useful and increasingly requested to spatialize models over a region, with wide concomitant heterogeneities in soil, climate, and management practices (Hartkamp et al. 1999; Faivre et al. 2004). In this respect, geographical data series and remote sensing images can, if properly used, allow to make models spatially explicit (Lesschen et al. 2007). Attempts have been made to take the spatial dimension of environmental and pedoclimatic conditions into account. Thus, Roger-Estrade et al. (2009) investigated the role of soil structure in the design of new crop management systems and considered both the spatial and the temporal variability. Houdart et al. (2009) presented a method to assess the potential risks of pesticide pollution at the watershed scale within the context of tropical areas with a high diversity of cultures and without information on the fate of pesticides in the environment. This method is broken down into four steps: surveying practices, determining the pesticide load for each field in the watershed, establishing an indicator of pollution, and spatializing the indicator (Houdart et al. 2009). Ewers et al. (2005) used landscape heterogeneity for the assessment of local biodiversity value within a predominantly agricultural landscape. Some researchers have tried to study the spatial dispersion and dynamics of pests. Ricci et al. (2009) studied the impact of landscape characteristics on the population level of codling moth in commercial orchards in the context of IPM using a Geographic Information System (GIS). They analyzed variations in the number of larvae using correlation tests and linear models (Ricci et al. 2009). The spatial dimension of farmers’ decisions or agricultural policies was also investigated. Le Ber et al. (2003) presented the knowledge-based system ROSA (Reasoning about Organization of Space in Agriculture) related to spatial and functional organization in agriculture. It combines hierarchical classification, case-based reasoning techniques, and qualitative spatial reasoning. Domain knowledge and cases are modeled with spatial organization graphs and represented within a description logic system (Le Ber et al. 2003). Reshmidevi et al. (2009) proposed a GIS-integrated fuzzy rule-based inference system for land suitability evaluation in agricultural watersheds. Lesschen et al. (2007) proposed a spatialized version of a methodology earlier developed to quantify soil nutrient balances at the national level in sub-Saharan African countries (Smaling et al. 1993). They developed techniques to make the methodology spatially explicit, re-estimated the original regression models for the various nutrient flows or replaced them by simple simulation models, and assessed the uncertainties of soil nutrient balance estimates. As a result, regional differences due to soil and climate variability can be taken into account and national soil fertility policies can be better targeted towards the lower levels, e.g., district or cooperation region (Lesschen et al. 2007). Major challenges lie in achieving the full interactivity of a GIS and a crop/pest model and satisfying spatial data requirements while ensuring data quality control using sensitivity and uncertainty analysis techniques. Regarding uncertainty especially, on the one hand, spatial data have intrinsic uncertainties due to measurement, digitization, or interpolation methods. On the other hand, crop/pest models are based on simplifying assumptions and produce uncertain outputs. However, models’ outputs are only meaningful when they have sufficient accuracy (Hartkamp et al. 1999; Lesschen et al. 2007). Users concerned by the reliability and the quality of models’ outputs need to know how these error sources interact. Uncertainty analysis techniques allow tracking down how uncertainties in the input variables and parameters propagate to the models’ outputs. They also have to take cross and spatial correlation between the various uncertainties and the scale dependency of uncertainties into account (Lesschen et al. 2007). There is still a poor understanding of how up- and down-scaling influence error propagation when models are interfaced to GIS (Hartkamp et al. 1999). More quantitative quality indicators together with spatial statistics and uncertainty analysis are needed to improve the value of GIS–modeling interfaces. 2.1.5 Models for genetic improvement Another important component of the model-based design of IPS concerns the genetic improvement of plants. The identification of genetic traits of plant tolerance or resistance to biotic stress has an important role to play in IPS. Moreover, the strong genotype × environment × management interactions in agricultural systems make it necessary to design genotypes that are adapted to specific agro-environments. This issue is of increasing interest to the crop modeling community. Many researchers have used the approach that consists of dissecting plant traits via a model based on physiological mechanisms, which describes the development of such traits through environment and genetic conditions—namely, by means of genetic coefficients (Boote et al. 2001; Hammer et al. 2002; Quilot-Turion and Genard 2009). Such an approach has the potential to interpret and predict the performance of individual genotypes under different managements and environments. On this basis, such models can be used for evaluating genetic improvement, for analyzing past genetic improvement from experimental data, and for proposing plant ideotypes for target environments (White and Hoogenboom 2003) using appropriate optimization algorithms (see “Comparison to other domains and critical analysis”). The values of genetic coefficients are often estimated, i.e., determined by numerical methods, and such methods require substantial sets of field data. Data are also needed to use the models as previously stated. Thus, linking crop models to extensive national and international databases, as it has been done in the SEAMLESS project framework with a pan-European integrated database (van Ittersum et al. 2008), can help to determine genetic coefficients and to allow an increased level of crop model applications for policy related to the design and choice of cultivars. 2.2 Databases and models for climate prediction 2.2.1 Databases As mentioned above, the model-based design of IPS requires well-built databases that describe experiments, plant genotypes, pest management practices, weather, and economic profitability. Many databases have been developed and have contributed to improving agronomic data storage and manipulation. They focus on field crop results (Ulery et al. 1998), genetic varieties (Haley et al. 1999; Zhang et al. 2002; Halling et al. 2004; Pruss et al. 2005), fruit orchards (Habib et al. 2001; Plenet et al. 2009), or are more comprehensive such as the SEAMLESS databases (van Ittersum et al. 2008). Despite the advances in documentation and protocols for agronomic data exchange and use, mainly due to the work of the ICASA group, the definition of a set of standards remains necessary (Hunt et al. 2001). It will contribute to improving crop modeling per se since there is a recognized need for standardized inputs and outputs, both within the modeling community and for potential model end-users. Databases describing pest behaviors, dynamics, and inter-specific competition must be developed and shared. 2.2.2 Models for climate prediction Climate prediction is very important to determine the conditions of emergence, development, and dissemination of pests and plants’ diseases. It is also crucial for all of the decision-makers involved, i.e., farmers, input suppliers, traders, marketers, and government agencies, since climate variability has an impact on agricultural productivity (Hammer et al. 2001). It is therefore necessary to take climate prediction into account for the design of IPS. The majority of work done in this area has dealt with the impact of climatic conditions and climate on agricultural production and resource availability for crops. These studies range from the field level to the continental and global scales. Reidsma et al. (2009) thus considered the impact of climatic conditions and farm characteristics on maize yield. Guerena et al. (2001) used the outputs of a general circulation model and a regional climate model as inputs of crop models to predict the impact of climate change and CO2 concentration on crops and their water use in Spain. Hammer et al. (2001) outlined the basis for climate prediction, focusing on the El Niño phenomenon, and catalogued experiences at field, national, and global scales in applying climate predictions to agriculture. More attention must be paid to this issue and much work remains to be done in order to effectively integrate climatic model parameters into crop/pest models. For a successful integration, it is important to take into account not only the uncertainty but also the spatial scale of validity of climatic predictions. The integration itself is mainly an engineering problem that requires joint efforts between modelers and climate prediction developers. 2.3 Simulation and model qualities The majority of existing crop models are crop species-oriented and characterized by a low scientific transparency and code efficiency mainly due to poor modularity and limited reuse and sharing. However, to better integrate the tools and models listed above, two main qualities are required from these models: modularity and genericity. On the one hand, a modular approach helps to avoid duplication of effort by allowing the reuse of standard modules. Muetzelfeldt and Massheder (2003) cited various solutions to ensure modularity. They include improved software engineering practices for implementing models in conventional programming languages, e.g., FSE: base of the DSSAT, APSIM, simulation languages for models based on sets of differential–algebraic equations, e.g., DYNAMO, visual modeling environments based on the system dynamics paradigm for continuous systems modeling, e.g., POWERSIM, and object-oriented/component-based approaches, e.g., MODCOM. They proposed SIMILE, a modeling environment that combines system dynamics with object-based paradigms, allowing many forms of disaggregation: a clear decomposition of a complex system into consistent elementary entities to be handled as well as spatial modeling and individual-based modeling (Muetzelfeldt and Massheder 2003). More recently, van Ittersum et al. (2008) proposed the SEAMLESS-IF component-based framework for the integrated assessment of agricultural systems. They developed an integrated framework in which individual knowledge components can be linked through a software infrastructure, allowing the use of selected and linked components. Individual knowledge components can be biophysical or economic models, databases, or indicators. A major interest of this framework is its ability to link and to reuse models of different geographical scales and from various domains while guarantying their transparency and documentation (Rizzoli et al. 2008; van Ittersum et al. 2008; Donatelli et al. 2009). These last two examples illustrate the methodological change that can help to overcome many of the drawbacks of existing crop models. On the other hand, in order to improve the genericity of crop models, Wang et al. (2002) proposed to develop process-oriented models. These models are based on common physiological processes and other similarities among crops and the separation of code and parameters to facilitate the re-parameterization of the same code for various crops. This solution allowed them to design the APSIM-GCROP software and to improve the modularity of APSIM (Wang et al. 2002). These principles could be applied to other crop/pest models as well. 2.4 Evaluation methods and optimization algorithms In studies using model-based design methodologies, there are two omnipresent steps: the design or generation of a set of cropping systems and their evaluation (deVoil et al. 2006; Loyce and Wery 2006; Bergez et al. 2010). The design of integrated production systems is a multicriteria problem since there are many antagonist criteria to be satisfied and many constraints to be respected. Therefore, we must resort to multiobjective optimization algorithms for the design itself and to multi-criteria evaluation techniques to assess the relevance of the cropping systems designed. Many multi-criteria evaluation methods have been developed and/or applied to assess the robustness of designed cropping systems. They mainly originate from the multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) domain. Research conducted in the MCDM domain during the second half of the twentieth century has given us access to practical methods for applying scientific decision theoretical approaches to multi-criteria problems (Linkov et al. 2004). They include Multi-Attribute Utility Theory (MAUT), the outranking procedure represented by the successive ELECTRE versions and PROMETHE methods, the mixed methods represented by ORESTE, and the fuzzy methods (Grabisch 1996). The purpose of all these methods is to allow decision-makers to evaluate and choose among alternatives based on tradeoffs between criteria and according to their preferences (Linkov et al. 2004; Sadok et al. 2008; Sadok et al. 2009). The MAUT algorithm is composed of three main phases: normalization and evaluation of the performance of each alternative in terms of its utility, definition of the preferential information, i.e., decision-maker’s preferences of each criterion, and aggregation using additive, multiplicative operators and ranking of all alternatives. The ELECTRE method is based on the outranking relation and comprises three steps: construction of the evaluation matrix (alternatives and criteria), calculation of the outranking relation, and exploitation of the outranking relation. The final ranking has a graphical form and is based on the outranking matrix that includes indifference, preference, anti-preference, and incompatibility (Zak 2009). Procedures based on outranking have two phases. First, the method uses the extended model of decision-maker’s local preferences for individual criteria including indifference, weak preference, strong preference, and incompatibility. Second, partial binary relationships such as “alternative A is at least as good as alternative B” are established for all criteria. ORESTE is a universal multiobjective ranking method based on the outranking relation. The ORESTE method algorithm is composed of three stages: definition of the input data (alternatives, criteria), construction of the global complete pre-order of alternatives, and construction of the global partial pre-order of alternatives. The final ranking of alternatives has a graphical character and corresponds to the final matrix constructed with the application of indifference, preference, and incompatibility relations (Zak 2009). All these methods require a fundamental operation known as criteria aggregation or how to combine criteria in order to evaluate alternatives. For instance, in MAUT one aggregates the individual utility functions, while in ELECTRE one aggregates preference relations on pairs of alternatives (Grabisch 1996). The innovation aspect, however, was largely focused on the procedure for choosing among alternative solutions rather than on the aggregation operation since the most common aggregation tool, which is still used today, is the weighted arithmetic mean (Grabisch 1996). There has been an increasing interest for fuzzy integrals because of their ability to model the interaction between criteria and to overcome the drawbacks of weighted sums. Unfortunately, these methods are absent in the agronomic field, whereas there are widely used in other domains such as transportation (Grabisch and Labreuche 2010). For the construction and generation of integrated cropping systems, two main approaches may be used. A first one consists of the generation, blindly, randomly, or using a complex algorithm, of a large set of strategies, the simulation and the evaluation of these strategies, and the application of selection methods to choose the best ones. While this method is easy to carry out, it has many drawbacks since it may be assumed to be an open loop system: there is no feedback to improve the solutions. To address these drawbacks, a second approach is more pragramatic. Like the first one, it starts by generating a set of solutions but it attempts to improve them iteratively. Using optimization techniques, it focuses on the most promising populations within the decision space. The final population of solutions will be returned when a stopping criterion, e.g., the number of iterations, the objective values, or no improvement, is satisfied. The optimization method used for the improvement of the solution population may be control-based or simulation-based. The control-based optimization approach is usually used for learning purposes when the structure of decision rules, i.e., the control variables involved in the rule, has to be determined. Artificial intelligence techniques such as reinforcement learning and dynamic programming generally applied to Markov decision problems are the most frequently used for this purpose (Bergez et al. 2010). When the structure of decision rules is known, the simulation-based approach is the most suitable and the most often used. Here, the optimization algorithm attempts to find the optimal set of decision rule parameters. The optimization methods used in the simulation-based approach case may be divided into methods applied to continuous or to discrete decision variables. They include gradient-based optimization methods, evolutionary algorithms, simulated annealing, or neural networks (Crespo et al. 2009). Some of the examples presented in the next section illustrate the use and application of the multiobjective optimization and evaluation methods, among others, for the model-based design of integrated production systems. 3 Model-based design of integrated production systems: examples, comparison to other fields, and critical analysis 3.1 Examples of model-based design In this section, we review the recent advances in the application of model-based design approaches for the development of innovative cropping systems in general and of integrated production systems in particular. We present some of the most successful examples of model-based design of integrated production systems. We begin by works aimed at the development of decision rules for cropping systems management. We then present works based on optimal control formulation techniques that usually seek to eliminate the pests. Finally, we present works that use more elaborated formulation techniques and more efficient optimization techniques such as evolutionary algorithms and simulated annealing. 3.1.1 Approaches for the development of decision rules Many researchers have studied the possibility of developing decision rules for the management of crops/pests and the design of innovative cropping systems. We can distinguish two types of approaches. The first one seeks to determine the structure of the rule while the second aims to identify the most appropriate rules to be applied in the field. Nolot and Debaeke (2003) have proposed a generic procedure that corresponds to the first approach by iteratively combining the design of cropping systems and the evaluation of their performances. In this approach, the authors suggested, after having identified suitable agronomic strategies corresponding to a set of criteria and constraints, to translate these strategies into a logical set of technical decision rules, to apply and evaluate the rule-based system, and to validate or refine the strategy and the rules (Nolot and Debaeke 2003). Debaeke et al. (2006) applied this method to the development and testing of rule-based crop management systems of sorghum grain under contrasting water regimes in southwestern France. The simulation model used was EPIC-Phase, which predicts sorghum yield and soil water and N dynamics with reasonable accuracy (Debaeke et al. 2006). The same approach was applied by Debaeke et al. (2009) to a range of environmental and production contexts in the perspective of integrated crop production prototyping. They studied three cropping system experiments in France: Toulouse, Dijon, and Versailles. This approach can be considered as hybrid since it relies on models, on agronomic background, and on regional references (Debaeke et al. 2009). The second approach was used by Tixier et al. (2008) to design sustainable banana-based cropping systems. They used SIMBA, a model that simulates interactions between banana plants, soil, water, and root nematode populations to assess the yield, economic outputs, and environmental risks under a panel of cropping techniques. The proposed approach was twofold. First, in order to determine the trends of cropping systems performances, the model explored a wide range of decision rules by varying the values of their control variables. The authors ranked the cropping systems according to the aggregation of evaluation criteria by weighted sum and applied an agronomic filter to eliminate the unfeasible systems. They analyzed the systems with the best scores to highlight trends. The second step consisted of a one-by-one “optimization” of some decision rules by testing different control variables to identify the most suitable variables and to precisely determine decision rules that should be tested in the field. The evaluation criteria were the gross margin and three indicators of potential environmental risks describing water exposure to pesticides, erosion, and soil quality. These indicators were based on an aggregation of variables using an expert system and fuzzy logic (Tixier et al. 2008). The main drawback of the first approach is the lack of information on the structure of the decision rules, i.e., which control variables must be considered. Efficient methods for learning, in the sense of artificial intelligence, are needed to overcome this problem. The model used was very limited since it only served evaluation purposes while the design itself was done manually. The second approach may be suited to simple systems with small decisional spaces. However, it also has some drawbacks including the possibility of losing some good strategies due to the filtering techniques and the poor exploration of the decision space. 3.1.2 Approaches using optimal control formulations Many researchers have used optimal control, a mathematical formulation method, to design integrated production systems. This approach is usually used in studies of pest biological control and, in general, when the studies focus on IPM techniques. Jerry and Gouzé (2004) and Mailleret and Grognard (2009) addressed biological control problems in the predator–prey framework and proposed a classical and a general predator–prey model with periodic impulsive additions of predators, respectively. These approaches consist of finding the optimal initial condition, i.e., the number of predators to be introduced at the first release to reduce or to eradicate pests (Jerry and Gouzé 2004). Guo and Chen (2009) presented a kind of time-limited pest control of a Lotka–Volterra model with impulsive harvest, i.e., withdrawing a number of pests from the system at a convenient time, described by the initial and boundary value problem of impulsive differential equations. In the majority of these contributions, a mathematical analysis of an optimal control problem made it possible to determine a necessary and sufficient condition to eradicate the pests (Mailleret and Grognard 2006; Mailleret and Grognard 2009). Other researchers have used numerical methods to solve optimal control problems. Zhang and Swinton (2009) proposed a dynamic optimization approach to develop an intra-seasonal dynamic bio-economic optimization model for insecticide-based pest management, taking both the biological control effect of natural enemies on pest density and the non-target mortality effect of insecticides on the level of natural pest control supplied into account. Saphores (2000) studied the possibility of spraying a pesticide as a “real option,” using a continuous time framework to conveniently analyze the impact of the pest density volatility on the timing of pesticide application. The farmer’s decision of applying a pesticide was formulated as an optimal sequential stopping problem solved using stochastic dynamic programming (Saphores 2000). The mathematical formulation of the problem is one of the disadvantages of the optimal control approaches. It forces the objective to be quadratic and can barely deal with problem constraints in state variables and/or in control variables. Many strong hypotheses are usually used in order to facilitate the resolution of such problems. Moreover, such approaches usually lead to continuous-time control laws that must be discretized in some way to be applied to integrated pest management (Cardoso et al. 2009). 3.1.3 Approaches for more elaborated formulations More elaborated and adequate formulations have been proposed in the literature for the design of innovative cropping systems, not necessarily in agreement with integrated production guidelines. They include among others multiobjective mathematical formulation and constraints satisfying problems. These formulations are considered as more adequate since they try to represent the problem in the most natural and transparent way. Thus, Rossing et al. (1997) looked for the optimization of flower bulb production systems within a group of growers using interactive multiple goal linear programming. They considered three objectives: farm gross margin, pesticide input, and nitrogen surplus. By considering these objectives together with the characteristics of the existing farming systems and the socio-economic and agronomic constraints, they produced a set of optimal strategies (Rossing et al. 1997). The main drawback here is related to the linearity of the objectives. In the design of integrated production systems, this condition is generally not satisfied. In Loyce et al. (2002b), the authors proposed a model-based approach to design prototypes of wheat-based cropping systems using the BETHA model (Loyce et al. 2002a). This model simulates and compares specified cropping systems on the basis of eight criteria including yield, gross margin, pesticide use, and seed quality. This approach includes three steps: generation of crop management strategies, evaluation of these strategies, and assignment of each one to either the category of good strategies or to that of bad ones. The authors formalized the generation of crop management strategies as a constraints satisfaction problem, a mathematical problem defined as a set of objects whose state must satisfy a number of constraints. They used a resolution method developed in the field of artificial intelligence. This resolution algorithm combines filtering to reduce the size of variable domains and tree search techniques with backtrack procedures to successively allocate the various possible values to each variable. The second step consisted of evaluating each crop management strategy using the predefined criteria. The evaluation method used in this approach was based on the notion of agreement and discordance intervals represented by fuzzy sets and used to express the gradual preferences of the decision-maker. Thus, for each crop management strategy, they calculated the values of membership functions indicating if the given criterion is favorable or opposed to the assignment of this strategy to the good or bad category. Finally, the assignment of a crop management strategy to a given category resulted from simultaneously satisfying overall agreement and overall non-discordance conditions. From our point of view, the aggregation operators used in the final step constitute a main drawback of this approach since they are close to a weighted sum. Moreover, there are a large number of parameters to be determined by the decision-maker. Chatelin et al. (2007) described a method for designing winter wheat management strategies using the Déciblé model. This method involved the use of a multi-stage procedure in which a simulation tool was used to explore a decisional space defined by an expert. They aimed to maintain a high wheat yield and grain quality while limiting the risks of nitrogen pollution by maintaining post-harvest soil nitrogen content below a given threshold. The management strategies were expressed as sets of decision rules for the possible technical choices such as cultivar, sowing date, sowing density, and nitrogen supply. The main idea behind this step-by-step approach is the progressive limitation of the decisional space. This method involved three stages: reduction of the decisional space and choice of criteria, choice of subgroup of cultivars in the chosen situations, and blind generation of technical management strategies mainly related to cultivar choice and N supply. The first stage was based on the situations observed in practice, on the possible representation within Déciblé, and on expert knowledge. At the second stage, cultivars with low yield or a high environmental risk were eliminated. Since the generation method used in this approach is blind, this approach has all the drawbacks of this type of generation methods (see above). The reduction process of the decisional space may also overlook some interesting strategies (Chatelin et al. 2007). Other researchers used decomposition algorithms to develop innovative cropping systems. Thus, Crespo et al. (2009) proposed the P2 hierarchical decomposition procedure to design irrigation management strategies using the MODERATO model. P2 is a simulation-based optimization method and a development of the P2p algorithm proposed by Bergez et al. (2004). Promising regions are selected by heuristics, divided into two parts, and each of them is evaluated by simulation. Different selection, division, and evaluation techniques were tested on a corn crop irrigation management problem in order to identify the combination of techniques that lead to the most efficient algorithm. The irrigation problem was modeled as a continuous stochastic problem with eight continuous parameters. Two criteria were used to evaluate solutions: the direct margin and the number of simulation runs required to reach it (Crespo et al. 2009). In deVoil et al. (2006), the authors used a multiobjective evolutionary algorithm coupled with the APSIM model to optimize cropping systems in Northeast Australia. The optimized variables were a discrete choice of land use during four seasons and the threshold level of available water to plant crops. The cropping system was designed as a 2-year rotation, with cotton and sorghum as potential summer crops and wheat and chickpea as winter crops. Decisions to be optimized comprised which crop to plant and when and the timing of planting in relation to current soil moisture conditions. The authors considered three criteria for evaluating the designed cropping systems: gross margin, financial risk, and erosion. They used a real multiobjective evaluation technique based on the concept of Pareto dominance. In the same way, Letort et al. (2008) used genetic algorithms and a functional–structural growth model to investigate the design of ideotypes for yield maximization. In order to link growth parameters to QTL, the genetic parameters were introduced into the GREENLAB model. The authors defined virtual genes and chromosomes to build a simple Mendelian genetic model that drove the settings of the species-specific parameters of the model. They also used QTL cartographer software to study the QTL detection of simulated plant traits. A genetic algorithm was implemented to define the ideotypes for yield maximization based on the GREENLAB model parameters and the associated allelic combination. They compared virtual QTL detection in the case of phonotypic traits and when traits are model parameters, and they found the last case as more accurate. Using this approach, the authors were able to calculate the parameters and the corresponding genotype associated with yield optimization of maize (Letort et al. 2008). Similarly, in Cardoso et al. (2009), the authors used the high-performance and well-known Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II for the design of biological pest control strategies. They modeled the system as a nonlinear impulsive dynamic programming problem and considered both the cost of application of the control action and the cost of economic damages. Using this modeling formalism, they hoped to effectively cope with the actual control action to be applied, which should be performed in a finite number of discrete time instances. The studied case was the control of soybean caterpillar by its natural enemies such as wasps and spiders. Other research has been conducted using this last family of optimization methods that suggests its interest for the design of IPS. Thus, Guan et al. (2009) developed a very interesting approach for resource assignments and scheduling based on a two-phase metaheuristic for a long-term cropping schedule. The two-phase metaheuristic performs the optimization of resource assignments and scheduling based on a simulated annealing and genetic algorithm and a hybrid Petri net model (Guan et al. 2009). These last approaches do not guarantee the optimality of the obtained solutions but they are promising, especially when combining their respective performances. For instance, the selection, division, and evaluation techniques developed for the hierarchical decomposition may be introduced in the evolutionary algorithms instead of its selection and combination operators. Another interesting idea consists of using evolutionary algorithms in the hierarchical decomposition approach in order to determine the optimal division strategies. 3.2 Comparison to other domains and critical analysis Model-based design was originally introduced for embedded electronic systems and digital control systems. It has been successfully applied in several fields such as automotives, chemicals, aerospace, drug development, computer networks, and transportation networks, e.g., public, supply chain, gas, and liquids. In this section, we assess the use of the model-based design for new drug development and for transportation network design. We attempt to determine why model-based design is not yet as advanced for integrated production systems as it is for these two cases. The drug design case is among the closest to our case study since it has a biotic dimension and the interactions between heterogeneous elements, i.e., drug, patient, and environment, are quite visible. When designing a drug, researchers look for an organic molecule that activates the function of a biomolecule such as a protein, providing a therapeutic benefit to the patient. Many promising candidate drugs may turn out to be ineffective or toxic when tested on animals or humans. This is due to a poor understanding of the molecular mechanisms of the biological systems that they target. Recent advances in biological systems modeling have favored the use of the model-based design approach to improve drug development (Poland et al. 2006; Schoeberl et al. 2006; Scholz et al. 2006). In model-based drug design, mathematical equations are used to create computer-based models that represent relationships between drug treatments and observed effects. Models combine knowledge of a disease state, relevant biomarkers, and findings from pre-clinical and clinical studies with knowledge of placebo responses and dropout rates to gain insights into the determinants of efficacy and safety outcomes. Model-based drug design uses computational chemistry to develop drugs and related biologically active molecules. The fundamental goal is to predict whether a given molecule will bind to a target and, if so, how strongly. Many physicochemical methods such as knowledge-based scoring functions may be used to provide binding affinity estimates. They use techniques from the statistical or artificial intelligence domains (linear regression, machine learning, neural networks…) to provide predictive binding affinity equations by fitting experimental affinities to computationally derived interaction energies between the drug and the target. Computational methods have accelerated new drug development by reducing the number of iterations required regarding design, synthesis, and testing and have often provided more novel structures. Despite its recent introduction and its complexity, model-based drug design has enabled pharmaceutical companies to quickly identify optimal pathway targets and to determine the best approach. The models enlighten their decisions throughout drug development, enabling them to develop targeted therapeutics with higher efficacy and fewer side effects. The second case study is transportation networks design. There are many common characteristics between transportation networks and integrated production systems including the uncertainties, heterogeneity, weather issues, spatial distribution, and the intrinsic complexity. In transportation networks, complex dynamic processes take place that involve technical, economic, managerial, social, and political issues, exactly like in integrated production systems. The design of transportation networks focuses on determining the optimal set of operations for a given vehicle or set of vehicles so that a prescribed demand is satisfied. The main objective of the design process is to increase the capability of transportation networks to deal with service variations caused by stochastic events such as incidents, bad weather, road works, public events, or vehicle failure. The transportation networks design problem and all of its variants have been well researched within the operations research community. A great deal of modeling work has been done in this area including mathematical modeling, graphs, neural networks, Petri nets, multi-agent systems, and fuzzy logic (Ding and Guting 2004; Strub and Bayen 2006; Wu et al. 2006; Alecsandru et al. 2007; Celikoglu and Cigizoglu 2007; Ding 2008; Murat and Uludag 2008; Sidi et al. 2008a; Sidi et al. 2008b; Demongodin 2009; Tortum et al. 2009; Xie and Levinson 2009). Optimizing the configuration and the planning of transportation networks is a very difficult problem. However, model-based design approaches have greatly contributed to this area and have helped transporters to increase their service quality. Many optimization methods have been developed and applied to the models mentioned above. These techniques range from linear programming algorithms to more complex ones such as spanning tree algorithms, evolutionary algorithms, taboo search, simulated annealing, and specific heuristics (Current et al. 1987; Lotarev 1989; Klempous et al. 1994; Babel and Kellerer 2003; Nepal and Park 2005; Creput and Koukam 2007; Song et al. 2007; Sanchez-Silva et al. 2009; Unnikrishnan et al. 2009; Yao and Hsu 2009). The model-based design approach has proved to be more efficient and more effective in the cases of new drug development and of transportation networks than in the case of integrated production systems. This is certainly due in part to the relative simplicity of drug development and transportation networks design compared to integrated production systems. Because of this simplicity, the developed models are more comprehensive than the agronomic models, which are generally developed for a specific part of the agroecosystem under study, e.g., growth models, plant architecture models, nitrogen and carbon models. For example, transportation models take into account all of the system’s components, i.e., vehicles, passengers, routes, as well as its environment. The weather is considered through climate prediction models and the spatial distribution of the networks is usually taken into account via GIS and other tools. However, from our point of view, this is also due to a higher quality of the modeling done by leading researchers and engineers, especially in the case of transportation. This better modeling practice may be explained by various reasons. First, the modeling formalisms used in the transportation sector are usually more efficient and modern than those used in agronomic models because of the permanent exchange between transportation companies and software and technology editors. There are many enterprises that edit solutions, especially for the planning, regulation, and design of transportation networks. Second, data availability is not comparable between integrated production systems and transportation and drug design. Transportation companies as well as pharmaceutical companies have their own databases that describe all of the aspects of their systems and can provide modelers with necessary data in order to perform test and validate models. They also sometimes provide the means for purchasing required supplementary data when necessary. Third, despite the similarity of contexts and the importance of this task for the design process, the mathematical formulation of the objectives and the constraints is generally of better quality in the transportation sector than in agronomy. For example, the regularity of vehicles is determined by the time interval that separates the successive passages at the same station, and this formulation remains unchanged in all transportation models. Unfortunately, in the agronomic domain, there are as many formulations as there are models, even for a criterion such as the gross margin. It is truly difficult to standardize objectives and constraints in the case of agronomy, contrary to that of drugs or transportation. The progress reported in these two case studies may also be explained by another factor that cannot be overlooked: the importance of economic issues and challenges. The money allotted to transportation and drug design is considerable compared to that devoted to integrated production systems, which usually comes from the public budget. Finally, the introduction of systems approaches and the use of model-based design are relatively recent in agronomy compared to transportation. New advances in agronomic modeling will certainly and rapidly change the current situation. 4 Efficiency of model-based design As illustrated in the previous sections, many crop/pest/predator models, databases, GIS, and other tools have been developed for the simulation of agroecosystem performance. Nevertheless, the model-based design of integrated production systems is not yet accomplished and has not yet produced the expected results, with the exception of a few prototypes. The reasons for this difficulty concern the models and their specifications. Moreover, the application of modern design to this domain is still in its infancy. In the following section, we address modeling quality and targets and propose a methodological framework for using models to design IPS. 4.1 Modeling Adopting modeling methods used in other domains—such as DEVS used in the RECORD platform (Chabrier et al. 2007) and developed by INRA (French Institute for Agricultural Research)—would improve crop/pest models and their capacity to interact with other models. These formalisms allow us to use tools that have already been developed to develop more operational tools and, especially, to integrate heterogeneous formalisms. Furthermore, the development of modeling platforms that make it possible to integrate the necessary ingredients for the design of integrated production systems, i.e., crop/pest/predator models, databases, GIS, genetic improvement models, optimization and evaluation methods, etc., would enhance the modeling procedure and accelerate the design process. However, in order to facilitate the integration of these elements, each one must be designed in this spirit. The lack of modularity and genericity of current agricultural models makes it difficult to adapt these models to new crops and more generally prevents their reuse and sharing (Loyce and Wery 2006). Genericity can be enhanced by promoting process-oriented modeling rather than the crop species-oriented modeling usually used in the existing models. Regarding the modularity of models, the use of object-oriented and component-based techniques combined with other paradigms such as systems dynamics has proved to be very effective. As mentioned in “Model-based design of integrated production systems: brief overview of the elements involved”, the drawbacks of current agricultural models include their lack of adequacy with respect to the need of IPS. Most crop models that address the “production” component of IPS ignore pests and other biotic elements, making it difficult to take cultural innovations in terms of IPS and biodiversity issues into account. With respect to plant/pest/antagonist interactions, the challenge is to model complex trophic networks since, for example, pest communities impair the functioning of plants. Models such as WHEATPEST (Willocquet et al. 2008) and RICEPEST (Willocquet et al. 2002) must be developed and included in modeling platforms. The spatial dimension must also be more effectively integrated into models such as in the work of Stoorvogel et al. (2004). Combining GIS and artificial intelligence technologies, especially learning techniques, holds promise for the future and remains to be explored. The development of models would profit from a better involvement of stakeholders concerned by decision-making, considering the various levels of decision, e.g., local, regional, national (Giller et al. 2008), and from experts. The use of new protocols, methods, and formalisms devoted to the extraction of information, such as those used by Leger and Naud (2009), must be encouraged in order to more effectively take professional and expert knowledge into account. Finally, model study and evaluation, difficult tasks because of the heterogeneity of data and the multiplicity of factors influencing model outputs (Bellocchi et al. 2009), must be more closely considered since they allow us to determine both model reliability and model usefulness. When properly used, sensitivity analysis and other statistical methods can help us with this task. Other methods such as evolutionary algorithms may enhance this practice, as demonstrated in (Komuro et al. 2006) for the assessment of models during their construction. 4.2 Design: criteria choice, optimization, evaluation Once the development of comprehensive models is achieved, the model-based design itself may be dealt with. As previously mentioned, there are four steps in this process: the definition of objectives and constraints, design, evaluation, and choice and dissemination of the proposed systems. The first and the fourth steps are generally neglected, while the design and evaluation steps are omnipresent in studies using model-based design methodologies. However, the definition of criteria and constraints and their mathematical formulation are key elements in the model-based design approach and are very important for the choice of evaluation methods and optimization algorithms to be used in the design and evaluation steps. The choice of evaluation criteria can be improved based on preliminary tests and by using techniques such as principal component analysis, sensitivity analysis, or tradeoff curves (Stoorvogel et al. 2004). All of these methods can enable to identify the possible relationships between the criteria. Experts and stakeholders can also express their opinions and thus help modelers to determine the degree of redundancy or complementarities between criteria and recommend the criteria to be taken into account. At this stage, conflicts can appear and a formal negotiation approach can help their resolution as demonstrated by Giller et al. (2008). Another asset, which is hardly ever used, makes it possible to ground virtual design on solid bases. This is the set of constraints for each decision variable and their combination that we can impose on the resolution algorithm in the design step. When the criteria are chosen and the constraints defined in workmanlike, the model-based design of integrated production systems may be formulated as a multiobjective optimization problem. This problem is then treated using various approaches that mainly deal with the exploration of the decision space and the evaluation of the solutions obtained during this exploration. As discussed in “Model-based design of integrated production systems: brief overview of the elements involved” and “Model-based design of integrated production systems: examples, comparison to other fields, and critical analysis” of this paper, many multiobjective evaluation methods and optimization algorithms have been developed or applied for the design of integrated production systems. The complexity of the problems and the difficulty of analytically expressing the criteria and constraints in terms of decision variables promote the use of the simulation-based approach rather than the control-based approach. New optimization methods such as multiobjective evolutionary algorithms combined with efficient quantitative aggregative methods such as fuzzy integrals are quite well suited to IPS design. Another promising avenue is the development of non-aggregative approaches that aim to find a real compromise between the evaluation criteria and to provide decision-makers with a set of compromise solutions known as Pareto-optimal solutions. These solutions represent the best tradeoff across all criteria since no other solution is more effective when all of the objectives are considered. This approach makes it possible to avoid the drawbacks of aggregative methods that are more sensitive to the shape of the Pareto-optimal front. 4.3 Choice and dissemination The qualitative decision-making family, which include methods such as the MAUT (see “Evaluation methods and optimization algorithms”), is more convenient for comparison purposes when the cardinal of the solution set is small and for the choice of the best systems when the design and evaluation steps have been achieved. The set of solutions returned by the multiobjective optimization algorithm from the design and evaluation steps can be compared using tools such as DEXI (Sadok et al. 2009) in order to select the best one. Tradeoff analysis techniques are also helpful since they allow representing graphically the tradeoff curves and studying the effect of all solutions on the position and slope of these curves (Stoorvogel et al. 2004). The model-based design cannot and does not aim to replace experimentation but, instead, to facilitate the choice of the most promising production systems (Sterk et al. 2007). The candidate systems proposed by this approach should be tested against real conditions, experimented, and, if necessary, adjusted before being recommended to a few testers, re-adjusted if necessary and then evaluated within wider networks. If all of the steps prove themselves to be successful and fruitful, the best strategies or the best systems can then be recommended to producers and policymakers in order to help them make the most effective choices for the greatest benefit to society.

Te world population is expected to reach over 9 billion by 2050, which will require an increase in agricultural and food
production by 70% to ﬁt the need, a serious challenge for the agri-food industry. Such requirement, in a context of resources
scarcity, climate change, COVID-19 pandemic, and very harsh socioeconomic conjecture, is diﬃcult to fulﬁll without the in-
tervention of computational tools and forecasting strategy. Hereby, we report the importance of artiﬁcial intelligence and machine
learning as a predictive multidisciplinary approach integration to improve the food and agriculture sector, yet with some
limitations that should be considered by stakeholders.
1. Introduction
Te estimation of the global food production must be in-
creased by 60–110% to feed 9-10 billion of the population by
2050 [1, 2]. Tus, the sustainability of agriculture ﬁeld is the
key to guarantee food security and hunger eradication for
the ever-growing population. In addition, due to the ap-
pearance of several food safety scandals and incidents in the
food sector such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy and
dioxin in poultry [3], a well-documented traceability system
has become a requirement for quality control in the food
chain. Moreover, weather and climate change conditions,
together with the sustainable water management due to
water scarcity, are crucial challenges in the next years. For
these reasons, urgently, the establishment of a strategic shift
from the current paradigm of enhanced agricultural pro-
ductivity to agricultural sustainability is needed. To antici-
pate eﬃcient solutions, helping farmers and stakeholders to
enhance their decision by adopting sustainable agriculture
practices is a crucial choice, especially the use of digital
technologies including Internet of things (Iot), Artiﬁcial
Intelligence (AI), and cloud computing. Additionally, the
subsets of AI (machine and deep learning algorithms)
combined with location intelligence technologies are ex-
tensively used. Te goal of our review is to present the main
applications of artiﬁcial intelligence and machine learning
techniques in the agri-food sector.
2. Artificial Intelligence and Machine
Learning Approach
Te artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) is a creative tool that simulates
the human intelligence and ability processes by machines,
principally computer systems, robotics, and digital equip-
ment [4]. Several applications of the AI include natural
language processing (NLP) to comprehend human verbal
communication as it is spoken, computer vision to see an
analog-to-digital conversion such as video, and speech
recognition and expert systems to simulate the judgment.
Te AI encoding is based on learning (acquire data and then
create algorithms to turn them into actionable information),
reasoning (choose the right algorithm to reach a preferred
result), and self-correction (continually adjust designed
algorithms and ensure that they provide the most accurate
results) as three cognitive skills [5]. Te AI technique is being
used in several sectors which are seeing the fastest growth in
the recent years such as ﬁnance, healthcare, retail, phar-
maceutical research, intelligent process automation, and
marketing. Machine learning (ML) is one of the central
themes of AI and helps people to work more creatively and

eﬃciently. In ML, statistical and mathematical methods are
used to learn from datasets to make data-driven predictions/
decisions. Several diﬀerent methods exist for this. General
distinction can be made by two systems; the ﬁrst one is the
symbolic approaches (the induced rules and the examples
are explicitly represented) and the second one is the sub-
symbolic approaches (artiﬁcial neuronal networks: ANN).
Te ML approach is classiﬁed into three major tasks: su-
pervised,
unsupervised,
and
reinforcement
learning.
According to the supervised learning, the aim of this ap-
proach is to map the variables to the preferred output
variable [6]. Te predictive model is created using the labeled
data with the prior knowledge of the input and the desired
output variables. Algorithms used under supervised learning
techniques are numerous, particularly, decision trees,
Bayesian networks, and regression analysis. Concerning the
unsupervised learning, it includes algorithms such as Ar-
tiﬁcial Neural Networks (ANNs), clustering, genetic algo-
rithm, and deep learning and uses unlabeled datasets
without prior knowledge of the input and output variables.
In fact and as mentioned by Jordan and Mitchell [7], this
case of unsupervised machine learning method establishes
the hidden patterns by using the unlabeled dataset and is
primarily used for dimensionality reduction and exploratory
data analysis. According to the third category of ML task
named the reinforcement learning, numerous algorithms are
used for machine skill acquisition, robot navigation, and
real-time decision making such as Q-learning and deep
Q-learning. In this case of ML task, the learner interacts with
the environment to collect information and the two steps of
training and testing datasets are combined. Te learner gets
awarded for his actions with the environment leading to an
exploration versus exploitation dilemma. Te learner must
explore new unknown actions to gain more information as
compared to exploiting the information already collected
[8]. Recently, AI technology has opened the doors of its
implementation in the agri-food sector. In fact, AI ap-
proaches oﬀer signiﬁcant contributions and assistances to
understanding a model’s identiﬁcation, service creation, and
the decision-making processes as support to the diﬀerent
agri-food’s applications and supply chain stages. Te prin-
cipal goal of AI in agriculture is to provide precision and
forecasting decision in order to improve the productivity
with resource preservation [4]; through this, AI tools pro-
pose algorithms to evaluate performance, classify patterns,
and to predict unexpected problems or phenomena in order
to solve comprehension problems in the agricultural ﬁeld
and for the identiﬁcation of pests and its suitable method of
treatment, as well as the management of the irrigation
process and water consumption by setting up smart irri-
gation systems. Abiotic and biotic factors are being assessed
through remote sensing and sensors in order to optimize
crop and livestock management [4, 9]. In addition, the AI
implementation and applications have enormous advan-
tages which could revolutionize the agri-food sector and its
related business. Firstly, AI provides more eﬃcient ways to
produce, harvest, and sell crops products as well as emphasis
on checking defective crops and improving the potential for
healthy crop production and also AI is being used in
applications such as automated machine adjustments for
weather forecasting and disease or pest identiﬁcation with
98% accuracy. In fact, recently, Sujatha et al. [10] compared
the performance of machine learning (ML) and deep
learning (DL) methods to detect and identify the citrus plant
leaf disease. Tey showed that the VGG-16 deep learning
method gave the best result in terms of disease classiﬁcation
accuracy. Secondly, the progression in the AI technique has
reinforced agro-based businesses to run more proﬁciently by
improving crop management practices, thus helping many
tech businesses invest in algorithms that are becoming useful
in agriculture as well as by solving the contrasts farmers face
such as climate variation and an infestation of pests and
weeds that decreases yields. Indeed, Crane-Droesch [11]
developed a novel modeling approach for augmenting
parametric statistical models with deep neural networks,
which we term semiparametric neural networks (SNNs), and
by using data on corn yield from the US Midwest, they
showed the outperformance of this approach in predicting
yields of years withheld during model training compared to
classical statistical methods and fully nonparametric neural
networks. Tirdly, by using AI tools, farmers could be able to
remain updated with the data related to weather forecasting
and, therefore, predicted weather data help farmers to in-
crease yields and proﬁts without risking the crop, and as a
result, after analyzing the generated data, AI allows the
farmers to better understand and learn and then to take the
precaution by implementing practices in order to make a
punctual smart decision. In fact, Fente and Singh [12]
collected diﬀerent weather parameters (temperature, pre-
cipitation, wind speed, pressure, dew point visibility, and
humidity) from the Indian climate data center and imple-
mented a weather forecasting model by using a recurrent
neural network (RNN) with the long-short-term memory
(LSTM) technique. Tey concluded that the used technique
gave high-accuracy results compared to other weather
forecasting approaches. Fourthly, AI approaches are capable
of monitoring soil health and management by conducting
and identifying the possible defects and nutrient deﬁciencies
in the soil either by image captured with the camera rec-
ognition tool or by deep learning based tool to analyse ﬂora
patterns in farms and to simultaneously understand soil
defects, plant pests, and diseases. In fact, Suchithra and Pai
[13] classiﬁed and predicted the soil fertility indices and pH
levels of Kerala north central laterite Indian region soil by
using the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) technique with
diﬀerent activation functions such as hard limit, sine-
squared, triangular basis, hyperbolic tangent, and gaussian
radial basis. Tey revealed that the maximum performance
(80% of the accuracy rate calculations in every problem) for
four out of ﬁve problems was obtained with the Gaussian
radical basis function followed by hyperbolic tangent.
However, the best performance (90%) of the pH classiﬁ-
cation problem was given by the hyperbolic tangent, whereas
the moderate values were given by the gaussian radial basis.
Fifthly, an important functional beneﬁt of the AI technology
employment is the environmental protection by decreasing
pesticide usage. For example and in order to manage weeds

implementing robotics, computer vision, and machine
learning could help farmers to spray chemicals only where
the weeds are; thus, this directly reduced the use of the
chemical substance spraying on the whole ﬁeld. Conse-
quently, AI tools are helping farmers ﬁnd more eﬃcient
actions to protect their crops from weeds. Finally, the
practice of the advanced AI-based technologies has other
advantages on the agri-food supply chain such as reducing
employee training costs, reducing the time needed to solve
problems, reducing the amount of human errors, reducing
human intervention, and oﬀering an automated good, ac-
curate, and robust decision-making on the right time with
low cost [14].
3. Artificial Intelligence Technology and
Application to Improve Agriculture and
Food Industries
Currently, the use of ML algorithms in the main four clusters
(preproduction, production, processing, and distribution) of
the agriculture supply chain is becoming more and more
important [15]. In fact, in the preproduction step, the ML
technologies are used, especially for the prediction of crop
yield, soil properties, and irrigation requirements. In the
next stage of the production phase, the ML could be used for
disease detection and weather prediction. Concerning the
third cluster of the processing phase, utilization of ML
approaches is applied, especially to estimate of the pro-
duction planning to reach a high and safe quality of the
product. ML algorithms could be used also to the distri-
bution cluster, especially in storage, transportation, and
consumer analysis. Te preproduction cluster is the initial
step in the agriculture supply chain. It mainly concerns the
prediction of crop yield, soil properties, and irrigation re-
quirement. Many researchers report the importance of the
crop yield production in order to better support plant
management. In fact, by using as an input data (equipment
requirements, nutrients, and fertilizers) in predicting eﬃ-
cient models based on ML algorithms, these precision ag-
riculture tools aim to make stakeholders and farmers
support ideal decision in crop yield forecasting and improve
the smart farming practices. Recently, diﬀerent ML algo-
rithms are used for crop yield prediction such as the
Bayesian network, regression, decision tree, clustering, deep
learning, and ANN [16–18]. According to the prediction of
soil management properties, several ML algorithms are used
in learning soil properties. Among them, the LS-SVM (least-
squares support vector machine) method was used by
Morellos et al. [19] to study 140 soil samples. Nahvi et al. [20]
used the SaE (self-adpative evolutionary) ML algorithm to
boost the performance of the extreme learning machine
(ELM) architecture to estimate daily soil temperature. Ad-
ditionally, Kumar et al. [21] proposed a novel method named
the CSM (Crop Selection Method) to resolve crop selection
problems and help improve net yield rate of crops over the
season. In addition, Ben Ayed et al. [16] analyzed 18
worldwide table olive cultivars by using morphological,
biological,
and
physicochemical
parameters
and
the
Bayesian network to study the inﬂuence of these parameters
in tolerance, productivity, and oil content. Tey revealed that
oil content was highly inﬂuenced by the tolerance of the
crop. Another important parameter in the preproduction
cluster is the irrigation management that plays a crucial role
in aﬀecting the quality and quantity of the crops. In fact, to
achieve an eﬀective irrigation system (better decision in
when, where, and how much to irrigate), researchers used
soil moisture data, precipitation data, evaporation data, and
weather forecasts as input data for simulation and optimi-
zation of predicted models based on ML adequate algo-
rithms [22]. In fact, Arvind et al. [23] demonstrated that
using ML algorithm associated with other technologies such
as sensors, Zigbee, and Arduino microcontroller was eﬃ-
cient for prediction and tackles drought situations. In ad-
dition, Cruz et al. [24] exploited the ANN feed-forward and
back-propagation technologies to optimize the water re-
sources in a smart farm. More recently, Choudhary et al. [25]
used PLSR and other regression algorithms as an artiﬁcial
intelligence tool combined with sensors for data collection
and Internet of things hardware implementation to increase
eﬃciency and economic feasibility.
Te production cluster is the second phase in the ag-
riculture supply chain. Tere are numerous parameters that
aﬀect and play a key role in the crop production step. Among
them are the weather forecasts (sunlight, rainfall, humidity,
etc.), crop protection against biotic stress factors (weeds and
pathogens) and abiotic stress factors (nutrient and water
deﬁciency), crop quality management, and harvesting. Many
diﬀerent ML algorithms are used to simulate eﬀective
models for weather prediction (ANN, deep learning, deci-
sion tree, ensemble learning, and instance-based learning)
[26], for crop protection (clustering and regression) [27],
ANN, deep learning [14], weed detection (ANN, decision
tree, deep learning, and instance-based learning) [28], crop
quality management (clustering and regression) [29], and
harvesting (deep neural networks, data mining techniques
such as k mean clustering, k nearest neighbor, ANN, and
SVM) [30]. During the harvest stage which is the ﬁnal
horticultural stage after the ripening of the crops, ML al-
gorithms are also used to predict the transformation of the
fruit or crop color. In fact, many research teams used ML
algorithms to predict the fruit ripening stages and fruit
maturity such as Gao et al. [31] who achieved 98.6% clas-
siﬁcation accuracy when they used hyperspectral datasets
and the AlexNet CNN deep learning model to classify the
strawberry fruits into early-ripe and ripe stages. Te pro-
cessing cluster is the third stage in the agriculture supply
chain. Tere are many types of processing techniques of
agriculture products such as heating, cooling, milling,
smoking, cooking, and drying. Te choice of eﬀective
combined parameters in the processing stage results in a
high quality and quantity of food product and, at the same
time, avoiding overutilization of resources. To achieve this
goal, several food industries use modern food processing
technologies by installing software algorithms based on ML.
Among the used ML algorithms, there are genetic algorithm,
ANN, clustering, and Bayesian network [32]. In fact, Arora
and Mangipudi [33] proposed support vector machine
Journal of Food Quality

(SVM) classiﬁer and artiﬁcial neural network (ANN) models
to detect the presence of nitrosamine in the red meat food
samples, and the obtained predictive modeling results
revealed that the highest testing accuracy was obtained using
the deep learning model. Additionally, Farah et al. [34] used
diﬀerential scanning calorimetry combined with ML tools
(such as gradient boosting machine, random forest, RF,
multilayer perceptron, MLP, and GBM) to determine the
milk characteristics and authenticity and to detect fraud. Te
most eﬃcient results were obtained with GBM and MLP
machine learning tools which were able to classify 100% of
adulterated samples. Te distribution cluster is the ﬁnal step
in the agriculture supply chain. Tis stage is the connection
between food production and processing and the ﬁnal use or
ﬁnal consumer. ML algorithms could be used in storage,
transportation, consumer analytics, and inventory man-
agement. In transportation and storage steps, the mainly
used algorithms are genetic algorithm, clustering, and re-
gression. Tese predictive techniques aim to better preserve
the food product quality, to ensure safe food products and to
minimize the product damage by tracing the product [16].
For the consumer analytics, ML techniques such as deep
learning and ANN are used in the food retailing phase for
predicting consumer demand, perception, and buying be-
havior. For the inventory management, the use of ML ge-
netic algorithms helps in predicting daily demand and to
ensure that there are no inventory-related problems [35].
Examples of AI-applied technology are numerous in the
agri-food sector, i.e., robotics and mechatronics [2], drones
[2, 36], geographic information systems (GISs) [37],
blockchain (BC) [38], and satellite guidance [2]. Miranda
et al. [39] have reported and described these items as sensing,
smart, and sustainable technologies, providing systematic
process where connectivity, automation, precision, moni-
toring, and digitization are prevalent [40–43]. Smart
mechanization, robotics, and mechatronics in agriculture
aim to reduce drudgery and minimize inputs using highly
autonomous and intelligent machines [2]. From horse to
tractor, robots, and intelligent vehicles, a revolutionary era
has come for agriculture and food industry, from rudi-
mentary to high eﬃciency of agriculture with the intro-
duction
of
mechanization,
innovative
technologies,
computerized analysis, and decision, improving farming
activities and crop productivity [2]. Revolutionizing ma-
chines, often called “agribots,” are now used in agriculture
for all kinds of activities, namely, soil preparation, seed
sowing, weed and pest treatment, irrigation, fertilization,
and ultimately, grain and fruit harvesting, minimizing eﬀort
and energy cost [2, 44–47]. As a whole crop management,
agricultural drones can be used starting from soil treatment
(herbicide), going to sowing step, plant treatment (pesti-
cide), and physiological control and observation, and ending
with harvest time determination [2, 36, 48–51]. Agricultural
drones are now able to supply water, fertilizers, herbicides,
and pesticides and even ﬁlm, capture images, and generate
maps in real time of plants and ﬁeld in order to help farmers
take management decision [2, 48, 52–56]. Today, farmers use
drones for livestock surveillance for monitoring illnesses,
injuries, and even pregnancies [57]. In 2019, the worldwide
agriculture drone market value was about USD one million
and is expected to reach USD 3.7 million by 2027 [58],
whereas the robot and agriculture drone market is projected
to reach USD 23 billion by 2028 [59, 60]. Based on geospatial
technology that relies on satellite, GIS is applied on several
ﬁelds of agriculture: crop management, irrigation control,
yield estimation, disease and weed control, farming auto-
mation, livestock monitoring, vegetation mapping, erosion,
and land degradation forecast [37, 61–68]. Application of
GIS is, therefore, suitable in precision agriculture, real-time
control, and raising awareness and signiﬁcantly contributes
to meet the needs of continuous rise in food demand.
Blockchain is another technology that answers to con-
sumer’s awareness about food origin, quality, and mainly,
safety. BC aﬀords transparency, trust, certiﬁcation, and
traceability of food product supply chain from farm to fork,
where every single operation and data are timely registered,
saved, encrypted, and secured, not in a single central server
nor under a single control, but in a common platform
database where every user could access and take part in
transactions [38, 69–79]. Such digital and computerized
traceability of the whole food supply chain would allow
detection of deﬁciency, contamination, and adulteration of
the product, thus optimizing its quality and safety; therefore,
a multitude of agencies, consortia, and platforms were born
in this context [79]. In 2020, the worldwide market of BC in
agri-food market size was about USD 133 million; it is es-
timated to grow and reach around USD 950 million by 2025
[69]. Satellite-guided technology applied to agriculture
improved farm monitoring and aided mapping agricultural
zones, soil management, crop husbandry, irrigation disease
and
weed
control,
yield
estimation,
and
harvesting
[2, 80–88]. Hence, in the late 1900s, one single farmer was
able to produce food grains for 128, actually, and in the
future, through smart agriculture, this ratio will greatly
increase [2].
4. Limits and Drawbacks of AI and ML
However, despite all these advantages, the AI technology has
also some drawbacks representing challenges. Firstly, the
most important social challenge is the unemployment that
could be a threat; in fact, smart machines and robots could
replace the majority of the repetitive works and tasks; thus,
human interference is becoming less, which will cause a
major problem in the employment standards. Other tech-
nological challenges, for instance, machines can do only
those tasks which they are programmed or developed to do,
and anything out of that they tend to crash or give irrelevant
outputs could be a major backdrop. In addition, the high
costs of creation and maintenance of the smart machines as
well as the cleaver computers could be considered as
technological limits of the AI technologies, especially that AI
is updating every day which is why the hardware and
software need to get updated with time to meet the latest
requirements. Machines need repairing and maintenance
which is expensive. Te creation requires huge costs as they
are very complex machines. Other issues related to these
applications are their high cost that could increase the price

of the products. Moreover, beyond the opportunities
aﬀorded by smart and computerized technologies, some
risks and apprehensions could be posed for sustainability,
particularly the massive energy consumption, e-waste
problem, market concentration, job displacement, and even
the ethical framework [79, 89].
5. Conclusions
Te agriculture and food industries are one of the most vital
ﬁelds for humanity. Te ﬁrst products of agriculture are used
as inputs in several multiactor distributed supply chains,
including four clusters or stages of the agriculture supply
chain (preproduction, production, processing, and distri-
bution) in order to reach the end user or consumer. Due to
several challenges in the future for the agriculture and food
sector and various factors such as climate change, pop-
ulation growth, technological progress, and the state of
natural resources (water, etc.), it is urgent to use the digital
technologies at diﬀerent stages of agriculture supply chain
such as automation of farm machinery, use of sensors and
remote satellite data, artiﬁcial intelligence, machine learning
for improved monitoring of crops, and water, for agriculture
food product traceability. In the present study, we dem-
onstrate the main applications of the AI and ML algorithms
in diﬀerent clusters of the agriculture supply chain and the
unquestionable growing tendency in the adoption of these
algorithms to improve food industries.

Abstract From the perspective of sustainable development in irrigation areas, imperfect constraints, which have negatively impacted previous agricultural planting structure optimization models, tend to produce unreasonable optimization results. Thus, in this paper, attempts are made to incorporate the resilience of water resource systems into the constraint set and explore the optimal layout of agricultural planting structures in irrigation areas. We selected 12 sample irrigation areas in Heilongjiang Province, China, including Chahayang, Fuyu, and Tailai, as the research areas and considered their actual situations. Then, we established a multiobjective optimization model for an agricultural planting structure with rice, soybean, and corn planting areas as decision variables; socioeconomic benefits, agricultural production benefits, ecological benefits, and water resource benefits as objective functions; and water resource system resilience and net crop output value and other factors as constraints. Fifteen scenarios were assessed through the combination of objective functions, and the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGA-III) was used to optimize and analyze the agricultural planting structure of typical irrigation areas in Heilongjiang Province and to determine the optimal planting plan. The research results found that the function values adjusted by planting area have significantly improved compared to those before optimization. The adjustment trend of agricultural planting area is to increase the planting area of rice and soybean and reduce the planting area of corn. The introduction of constraints on water resource system resilience ensures that other benefits remain basically unchanged; thus, the water resource objective function is significantly better with resilience constraints than without them. Therefore, water resource system resilience can act as an effective constraint; this finding enriches and expands the theoretical and methodological system for optimizing the management of agricultural planting structures in irrigation areas and thus provides important technological support for ensuring regional food security, ecological security, and water security, which has substantial practical significance.

Introduction Agriculture, the foundation of the national economy, plays a crucial role in the healthy development of regional economies (Byerlee et al., 2009; Dorosh and Thurlow, 2018). However, due to people's excessive pursuit of grain yield and nonstandard agricultural production management, environmental and resource issues related to agricultural ecology and water resources are becoming increasingly serious (Garnett, 2013; Misra, 2013). A reasonable agricultural planting structure not only promotes local economic development but also reduces pollution and harm to the natural environment, promoting green and sustainable development of the agricultural economy. Optimization of the agricultural planting structure is a hot research topic in the field of agriculture today. The classical British economist Ricardo D proposed the theoretical basis of regional agricultural planting structure optimization, the comparative advantage theory, as early as 1817 (Watson, 2017), and subsequent research has continuously extended and developed on this theoretical basis. On the premise of ensuring normal grain growing operations, the optimization of agricultural planting structures in irrigation areas can fully leverage the resource advantages of the research area, develop regional planting characteristics according to local conditions, achieve maximum benefits and match agricultural modernization construction, which is of great significance (Li et al., 2020d). Relevant research (Garg and Dadhich, 2014; Adeyemo and Otieno, 2010; Mahmoodi-Eshkaftaki and Rafiee, 2020) focuses on the optimization and adjustment of agricultural planting structures in irrigation areas through the transformation of irrigation models; the economic benefits brought by adjustments to planting structure; and the growth environment and water requirements required by the crops themselves. Few scholars have optimized the sustainable development of water resources in irrigation areas. Therefore, to address challenges to the sustainable development of water resources in irrigation areas, which are caused by insufficient agricultural irrigation water, imperfect irrigation water management, and low irrigation water efficiency (Li et al., 2019; Li et al., 2020e), the concept of adjusting agricultural planting structure from the perspective of water resource resilience constraints is introduced. This concept, as part of the study of sustainable development issues in irrigation areas, can help to effectively alleviate the pressure on agricultural development and explore new paths for sustainable development in these areas. In the modeling of agricultural planting structure optimization and adjustment, the setting of constraint conditions is key to ensuring the rationality and reliability of the optimization results. Existing research mostly selects economic, ecological, social and other related constraint conditions (Li et al., 2020b; Notte et al., 2020; Yu et al., 2021). However, with the simultaneous growth of the agricultural production level and water resource demand, the contradiction between water resource supply and demand is evident. The optimization of agricultural planting structure can be explored from the perspective of sustainable development of water resources to effectively improve the resource utilization rate and address the contradiction between regional water resource shortages and agricultural production. In this field of research, Liu et al. (2021) organized and summarized the existing viewpoints on the resilience of water resource systems; furthermore, they proposed the connotation and measurement methods of the resilience of water resource systems in irrigation areas based on the agricultural characteristics of irrigation areas. However, the research results were limited to exploring the feasibility and spatiotemporal characteristics analysis of the resilience measurement and did not effectively establish a connection with agricultural planting structures. Therefore, based on these research results, water resource system resilience constraints are adopted to further explore the relationship between water resource system resilience and agricultural planting structure; to extend the research field of water resource system resilience; to enrich the research content of water resource system resilience in irrigation areas; and to provide a new path for the sustainable development of regional agriculture and water resources. In the process of optimizing agricultural planting, it is necessary to comprehensively consider multiple aspects, such as water resource systems, agricultural systems, socioeconomic systems, ecosystems, and technological management systems, which have typical multiobjective problem characteristics. The NSGA-III proposed by Deb and Jain (2013) has strong convergence ability in multiobjective optimization problems and can efficiently obtain the number of Pareto-optimal solutions in constrained multiobjective optimization problems. Compared to traditional multiobjective algorithms such as multiobjective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) and decomposition-based multiobjective algorithms (MOEAD), it is not prone to problems such as local optima and poor robustness (Luo et al., 2018; Britto and Pozo, 2014). The NSGA III algorithm has advantages in solving diverse solutions, strong stability, and high-dimensional multiobjective optimization (Sun et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2019). Therefore, in this study, the NSGA-III algorithm is selected for multiobjective optimization research. The resilience constraint of water resource systems is then introduced into the optimization analysis of agricultural planting structures in irrigation areas, and the NSGA-III model is applied to solve it. The aim is to further strengthen the scientific nature of the optimization analysis of agricultural planting structure in irrigation areas, improve the connection between regional sustainable development and agricultural planting structure optimization, and enhance the pertinence of regulatory plans. The research objectives are as follows: (1) To explore the feasibility and implementation path of embedding the resilience of water resource systems into the constraint set of agricultural planting structure optimization models in irrigation areas; (2) To seek the optimal adjustment plan for agricultural planting structure in irrigation areas based on the NSGA-III algorithm; (3) To analyze the constraint effect of water resource system resilience on the optimization of agricultural planting structure. 2. Materials and methodology 2.1. Research area Heilongjiang Province, located in northeastern China, is one of the three largest black soil regions in the world, with four water systems: Heilongjiang, Wusuli River, Songhua River and Suifen River. The abundant water and soil resources mean that Heilongjiang Province's grain production occupies a special position in China, with the Sanjiang Plain and Songnen Plain being important strategic bases for ensuring national food security and agricultural product supply. However, the one-sided pursuit of increasing grain production, the imbalanced use of water and fertilization patterns, which results in groundwater overexploitation and water environment degradation, and the emphasis on planting patterns of high economic efficiency crops, which are not based on regional resource allocation, have severely affected the water security, food security, and ecological security of regional agriculture (Qi et al., 2018; Li et al., 2020c; Zhang et al., 2019b; Faiz et al., 2020). China attaches great importance to the food security and sustainable development of the two major plains and has successively proposed the overall plan for the comprehensive reform of modern agriculture in the “Two Great Plains” of Heilongjiang Province, as well as guiding opinions on the adjustment of corn structure in the “Sickle Bend” area. Under the constraint of water resource system resilience, the optimization and adjustment of agricultural planting structure in irrigation areas is crucial for ensuring food production and output value in the two major plains, while effective assistance for the sustainable development of regional agriculture must still be provided. Based on the representativeness and data completeness of the Sanjiang Plain and Songnen Plain irrigation areas in Heilongjiang Province, the agricultural planting structure optimization of the irrigation areas in Heilongjiang Province was studied by taking four irrigation areas in the Songnen Plain, namely, Chahayang, Fuyu, Tailai and Yi'an, and eight irrigation areas in the Sanjiang Plain, namely, Qixing, Erdaohe, Daxing, Jiangchuan, Wutong River, Xingkai Lake, Suibin and 859, as sample irrigation areas. The specific locations of the 12 irrigation areas are shown in Fig. 1. Download : Download high-res image (543KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Geographical location of the sample irrigation area. 2.2. Data sources Materials were collected from the Statistical Yearbook of Heilongjiang Reclamation Area (2008–2017), Meteorological Data of Heilongjiang Reclamation Area (2008–2017), Comprehensive Annual Report of Water Resources of Qiqihar Branch (2008–2017), Comprehensive Annual Report of Water Resources of Jiansanjiang Branch (2008–2017) and the multiobjective model construction data of rice, soybean, and corn planting areas corresponding to 12 irrigation areas including Chahayang Irrigation District from 2007 to 2016, as well as from evaluation index data of natural, economic, ecological, and social development. In addition, due to the uncertainty of the input parameters in a long time series and the output result being the optimal planting pattern obtained under certain objective functions and constraint conditions, various indicators from 2016 were used as reference values, and the constraint values were determined based on the 10-year data from 2007 to 2016 for subsequent research on optimizing and adjusting the agricultural planting structure in irrigation areas. 2.3. Construction of the multiobjective optimization model 2.3.1. Decision variables Heilongjiang Province grows mainly food crops, oil crops, hemp, medicinal herbs, fruits and vegetables, among which grains and legumes are the main crops. Grain is mainly composed of rice, wheat, and corn, while legumes are mainly composed of soybeans. In addition, Heilongjiang Province has planted crops such as sugar beets, tobacco leaves, medicinal herbs, forage grass, and green fodder. The crop planting proportion of 12 sample irrigation areas in Heilongjiang Province from 2007 to 2016 was calculated, as shown in Fig. 2. Download : Download high-res image (316KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. The planting area of three crops and the proportion of grain crop planting area to the total planting area in the sample irrigation area. Note: SR: rice planting area; SS: soybean planting area; SC: corn planting area; SG: planting area of grain crops; SE: planting area of crops other than grain crops; and ST: total planting area. Fig. 2 shows that the planting of grain crops is dominant, with the planting area of grain crops accounting for over 90% of the total planting area over the past decade. The minimum planting area reached 92.73% in 2007; it reached over 99% annually in 2014, 2015, and 2016. For food crops, the planting areas of rice, soybeans, and corn dominate. In the past decade, the total planting area of the three crops accounted for over 95% of the total planting area of grain crops, with the lowest value reaching 96.49% in 2008 and even exceeding 99% from 2010 to 2016. This proves that except for the three crops of rice, soybeans, and corn, there are almost no other grain crops planted in the 12 sample irrigation areas in Heilongjiang Province. Therefore, in this study, the planting areas of rice, soybean, and corn are used as decision variables to explore the optimization of agricultural planting structure under the constraint of water resource system resilience. 2.3.2. Objective function At present, research on the optimization of agricultural planting structure in irrigation areas and the resilience of water resource systems in irrigation areas is mainly analyzed from the perspectives of water resource systems, agricultural systems, ecological environment systems, and socioeconomic systems. Therefore, for the selection of objective functions for the optimization of agricultural planting structure in irrigation areas under the constraint of water resource system resilience, fertilizer application amount, net crop output value, total crop yield, and irrigation water consumption are proposed to characterize ecological environmental benefits, social and economic benefits, agricultural production benefits, and water resource benefits, respectively. Based on these four aspects, the optimization of agricultural planting structure is comprehensively considered (Wang et al., 2020; Chen, 2018; Chen, 2008). However, there is a contradictory and competitive relationship between various benefits, and during the mediation process, there is often a phenomenon where one aspect of the benefits improves while the other worsens. To better optimize the agricultural planting structure in irrigation areas of Heilongjiang Province, the objective functions of minimizing fertilizer application, maximizing net crop output, maximizing total crop yield, and minimizing irrigation water consumption are adopted. (1) Ecological benefit objective function (1) In the formula, yE is the total amount of fertilizer applied (kg); mi is the fertilizer application rate per unit area for the i-th crop, where the fertilizer application rate per unit area for rice is m1 = 339.45 kg/hm2, the fertilizer application rate per unit area for corn is m2 = 372.3 kg/hm2, and the fertilizer application rate per unit area for soybean is m3 = 128.1 kg/hm2 (Liu and Lian, 2019). xi is the optimal planting area (hm2) for the i-th crop. (2) Socioeconomic benefit objective function (2) In the formula, yS is the net output value of crops (yuan); bi is the unit price of the i-th crop (yuan/kg); ci is the unit yield of the i-th crop (kg/hm2); di is the unit area cost of the i-th crop (yuan/hm2); and xi is the optimal planting area (hm2) for the i-th crop. (3) Agricultural production efficiency objective function (3) In the formula, yA is the total crop yield (kg); ci is the unit yield of the i-th crop (kg/hm2); and xi is the optimal planting area (hm2) for the i-th crop. (4) Water resource efficiency objective function (4) (5) In the formula, yW is the total amount of irrigation water (m3); wi is the gross irrigation quota of the i-th crop (m3/hm2); xi is the optimal planting area for the i-th crop (hm2); wy is the net irrigation quota of the i-th crop (m3/hm2); and n is the effective utilization coefficient of irrigation water. Based on the objective functions of ecological benefits, socioeconomic benefits, agricultural production benefits, and water resource benefits mentioned above, a combination function of agricultural planting structure suitable for 12 sample irrigation areas in Heilongjiang Province is established. (6) 2.3.3. Constraint condition To construct an optimization model for agricultural planting structure in irrigation areas under resilience constraints, based on the establishment of objective functions, suitable constraint conditions should be developed according to local specific situations. In addition to resilience constraints, other constraints must be established in terms of ecological benefits, socioeconomic benefits, agricultural production benefits, and water resource benefits. Based on the objective function established in the previous section, the optimization of agricultural planting structure must be constrained in terms of fertilizer application per unit area, net crop output value, total crop yield, irrigation water consumption, and cultivated land area. The specific constraint expressions are as follows: (1) Constraints on fertilizer application rate (7) In the formula, yi is the amount of fertilizer applied to the i-th crop (kg); xi is the optimal planting area for the i-th crop (hm2); A = 420 kg/hm2 is the constraint value of fertilizer application per unit area (Liu and Lian, 2019); yj is the amount of fertilizer applied in the j-th irrigation area (kg); and xj is the optimal planting area (hm2) for the j-th irrigation area. (2) Constraints on net output value of crops (8) In the formula, bi is the unit price of the i-th crop (yuan/kg); ci is the unit yield of the i-th crop (kg/hm2); di is the unit area cost of the i-th crop (yuan/hm2); xi is the optimal planting area for the i-th crop (hm2); and B is the total net output value of crops (yuan). (3) Constraints on total crop demand (9) In the formula, ci is the unit yield of the i-th crop (kg/hm2); xi is the optimal planting area for the i-th crop (hm2); and C is the total demand for crops (kg). (4) Constraints on water consumption for crop irrigation (10) In the formula, wi is the gross irrigation quota of the i-th crop (m3/hm2); xi is the optimal planting area for the i-th crop (hm2); and D is the total amount of irrigation water used for crops. (5) Constraints on cultivated land area (11) In the formula, xij is the optimal planting area (hm2) for the j-th type of crop in the i-th irrigation area; e is the multiple cropping index; and ki is the total cultivated area of the i-th crop (hm2). (6) Constraints on water resource system resilience The resilience of water resource systems generally refers to the ability of the water resource system to gradually recover to structural stability, resource supply, and normal ecological environment regulation under the joint action of its own and external forces when the system structure and function undergo a certain degree of change in response to external factors such as natural, ecological and economic interference. The resilience of the water resource system in the irrigation area (RWRSIA) is related to the structure, function, and complexity of the system itself, as well as to external stress. For example, if the canal system has a high anti-seepage rate, good vegetation conditions, and social and economic prosperity, then people's lives are relatively abundant, water resource utilization is reasonable, and the resilience of the water resource system is high. In the opposite situation, the resilience of water resource systems is low. The optimization of agricultural planting structure in irrigation areas, such as the evaluation of the resilience of water resource systems in irrigation areas, is closely related to water resource systems, socioeconomic systems, ecological environment systems, and agricultural systems. Although the evaluation indicators for RWRSIA do not directly include the planting area of three crops, the adjustment of planting structure will cause dynamic changes in key driving factors for the evaluation of RWRSIA, such as the planting ratio of high water-consuming crops, per capita arable land area, and effective utilization coefficient of irrigation water, thereby indirectly affecting the resilience index and level of the water resource system in irrigation areas. To ensure the sustainable development of regional water resources after the optimization and adjustment of the agricultural planting structure, a constraint on the resilience of the water resource system is set. Referring to Liu et al., 2021, the evaluation level of RWRSIA is determined to be level I as the optimal level and level IV as the worst level. Whether the restoration level of the water resource system is ≤ Level III is determined after the planting structure is optimized under the constraint of water resource system restoration. Namely, (12) Ⅲ In the formula, RWRSIA (A, B, C) represents the water resource system resilience of the irrigation area when the optimized rice planting area, soybean planting area, and corn planting area are A, B, and C, respectively; IGWO-SVM (A, B, C) is the result based on the IGWO-SVM mode rating; and IGWO-SVM (A, B, C) indicates that the evaluation results of the IGWO-SVM model in scenario i should all be ≤ Level III. Based on this, the resilience level constraints of the water resource system in the irrigation area are set and organically combined with the optimization of the agricultural planting structure. The specific constraints of the resilience level of the water resource system in the irrigation area on the planting structure are shown in Fig. 3.

Connotation of the resilience constraints of the water resource system in irrigation areas. Note: Level I, II, III, and IV represent the resilience level of the water resource system. The planting area of each crop needs to meet nonnegative conditions: (13) In the formula, xi is the optimal planting area for the i-th crop (hm2). 2.4. Method for solving multiobjective optimization models 2.4.1. Pareto dominance relationship In minimizing multiobjective optimization problems, for m objective components , i = 1∼n, given any two decision variables , . If there is a need for , all have holds or exists i , such that is established. Then, it is called dominates . If there are no other decision variables that can dominate a decision variable, then the decision variable is called a nondominated solution, which is the Pareto optimal solution. However, for multiobjective problems, for a given set of optimal solutions, if the solutions in this set are mutually nondominant, i.e., the pairwise relationship is not dominant, then this solution set is called the Pareto solution set (Han et al., 2021). 2.4.2. NSGA-III algorithm The NSGA-III algorithm was initially improved by Deb and Jain on the basis of NSGA-II, using reference points instead of crowding to improve the selection mechanism. Compared to NSGA-II's ranking based on the crowding degree, NSGA-III's role in maintaining the population diversity ranking is more pronounced due to the introduction of reference points. Due to its advantages compared to other multiobjective optimization algorithms, especially its satisfactory results in various aspects compared to the MOEA/D method in the calculation process of up to 15 objectives, the NSGA-III algorithm was selected to solve the multiobjective problem. The specific implementation process of the algorithm is detailed in Deb and Jain (2013). 2.5. IGWO-SVM model The support vector machine (SVM) model was initially proposed by Vapnik et al. (1994). Due to its excellent performance in solving small sample, nonlinear, and high-dimensional problems, it has been widely applied by scholars from various countries in various fields (Li et al., 2020a; Wang et al., 2020). The main purpose of SVM is to build a classification hyperplane to distinguish different samples and maximize the classification interval. Specifically, the feature vector can be mapped from the low-dimensional space to the high-dimensional space through the kernel function to establish the discriminant function. The penalty parameter C and kernel function parameter σ have a great impact on the solution of the hyperplane. C represents the degree of punishment for exceeding the error range and is used to adjust the fit of the data. σ controls the radial action range of the kernel function. If its value is too small, it can easily cause overfitting, and if its value is too large, it can lead to a loss of learning ability. Therefore, the introduction of optimization algorithms for C and σ allows for parameter optimization. The gray wolf optimizer (GWO) algorithm was first proposed by Mirjalili et al. (2014) in 2014 in the article Gray Wolf Optimizer. This algorithm simulates the hierarchical system and hunting mechanism of gray wolves in nature. Due to its simple and efficient advantages, it has been widely used in various fields. However, the original GWO is prone to problems such as local optimization, low precision, and poor robustness for high-dimensional, multipeak function and multiobjective optimization problems. Deng S et al. (2019) proposed the differential evolution (DE)-GWO theory of combining the DE algorithm and the GWO algorithm to address GWO's comparative disadvantages. After updating the position of the wolf pack, this approach performs DE operations and selects mutations, crossovers, and other operations to create better individuals for the next generation. DE-GWO helps the GWO algorithm to avoid falling into local extrema and improves its overall search capabilities. Compared to the SVM model optimized by algorithms such as gravity search, the IGWO-SVM model exhibits higher classification accuracy and mean square error. Therefore, the IGWO-SVM model was selected to evaluate RWRSIA in Heilongjiang Province. The specific implementation process of the algorithm is detailed in Liu et al., 2021). 2.6. Scenario building Scenario analysis is typically used for the judgment of regional development trends. The conventional scenario setting method constructs scenarios by using three different levels: high, medium, and low, or the presence or absence of a certain key variable. In the Opinions on Implementing the Rural Revitalization Strategy issued by the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China (Yang et al., 2021), it is clearly noted that rural revitalization should adhere to the principle of adapting measures to local conditions and then gradually progressing. To balance the coordination of the objective function and the acceptability of farmers in the process of optimizing and adjusting the agricultural planting structure, the selection of planting area adjustment plans is tailored to local conditions. Based on the scenario setting method proposed by Li et al. (2020d), from the perspective of the objective function, different dimensional target combinations are set into 15 scenarios, as shown in Table 1. The 1st-4th scenarios in Table 1 are single-objective scenarios that can be directly solved through equations. The 5th-15th scenarios in Table 1 are multiobjective scenarios that need to be brought into the NSGA-III algorithm for a multiobjective solution. The year 2016 decision variable values are used as the control group for comparative analysis. Table 1. Scenario plan.

Analysis of algorithm solving efficiency To fully validate the reliability of the NSGA III algorithm, in this study, Deb et al.'s comparative pattern was referenced and DTLZ1, DTLZ2, DTLZ3, and DTLZ4 were selected as test functions. The NSGA III algorithm, the multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition penalty-based boundary intersection (MOEA/D-PBI), the multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition-Tchebycheff approach (MOEA/D-TECH), and the DE algorithm based on decomposition differential algorithm (MOEA/D-DE) were used to analyze model efficiency by calculating the inverse generational distance (IGD). The IGD represents the minimum distance between each point on the real Pareto frontier and the set of individuals obtained by the algorithm and evaluates the convergence and distribution performance of the algorithm. The smaller the value is, the better the overall performance, including convergence and distribution. The calculation results are shown in Table 2. Table 2. IGD values of different test functions for each algorithm. Algorithm Test function NSGA-Ⅲ MOEA/D-PBI MOEA/D-TCH MOEA/D-DE DTLZ1 2.453 × 10−3 3.693 × 10−3 1.189 × 10−2 3.728 × 10−2 DTLZ2 3.632 × 10−3 1.594 × 10−3 2.482 × 10−2 1.727 × 10−2 DTLZ3 1.121 × 10−3 2.857 × 10−3 4.268 × 10−1 6.225 × 10−1 DTLZ4 1.465 × 10−3 3.287 × 10−1 7.694 × 10−1 3.492 × 10−1 Table 2 shows that among the IGD values calculated by the four algorithms for the four test functions, only NSGA-III in DTLZ 2 has slightly better results than MOEA/D-PBI, though it has stronger results than the MOEA/D-TECH and MOEA/D-DE algorithms. The IGD results of NSGA-III are the minimum values in the remaining three test functions. Especially in DTLZ4, there is a significant difference in the calculation results. This result demonstrates the reliability of the model solution results obtained by the NSGA-III algorithm. 3.2. Benefit analysis of optimizing agricultural planting structure To obtain the optimal planting conditions and target benefits, the NSGA-III algorithm used population size pop_size = 100, cross parameter t1 = 20, mutation parameter t2 = 20, and number of iterations n_generations = 800 (Zhou et al., 2022) to calculate the single objective function values under the optimal planting conditions. Then, 11 sets of multiobjective combination forms were substituted into the NSGA-III algorithm. Finally, the objective function values under 15 different scenario modes were obtained; the results are shown in Fig. 5. Download : Download high-res image (839KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Optimal planting mode optimization benefits under different scenarios: (a) single objective; (b) dual objective; (c) three objectives and (d) four objectives. Fig. 5(a) shows that the single objective optimization corresponding to S1–S4, without considering other objective functions, significantly improves the corresponding objective function values after adjusting the planting area compared to before optimization, with a net output value increase of 11.08%, a total yield increase of 2.88%, a decrease in fertilizer application rate of 7.24%, and a decrease in irrigation water consumption of 30.77%. In the multiobjective situation, the values of different objective functions decrease compared to those in the single-objective situation. Fig. 5(b) shows that under the dual target scenario, the overall increase in net output value is 6.13%–9.43%, the overall increase in total yield is 1.57%–2.36%, the overall decrease in fertilizer application is 2.07%–6.47%, and the overall decrease in irrigation water consumption is 27.97%–29.37%. Fig. 5(c) shows that under the three target scenarios, the overall increase in net output value is 4.6%–8.49%, the overall increase in total yield is 0.79%–1.57%, the overall decrease in fertilizer application is 2.42%–4.96%, and the overall decrease in irrigation water consumption is 26.92%–28.67%. Fig. 5(b) and (c) show that S5, S11, and S12 are scenarios that consider both net output value and total yield objective functions. Among the three scenarios, the social benefit objective function is slightly larger than its combination with other objective functions, and the agricultural production benefit objective function is slightly larger than its combination with other objective functions. S7, S12, and S14 are scenarios that consider both net output value and irrigation water consumption, and the resulting social benefit objective function values are slightly smaller than their combined form with other objective functions. Rice can bring significant economic benefits due to its high economic efficiency but has far greater water needs compared to corn and soybeans; thus, Heilongjiang Province, which is short of water resources, needs to limit increases in rice area to some extent. S8, S11, and S13 are scenarios that simultaneously consider the two objective functions of total yield and fertilizer application. Among the three scenarios, the value of the agricultural production efficiency function is slightly smaller than its combination with other objective functions. Similarly, from the perspective of ecological benefits, when considering both the fertilizer application and total yield objective functions, the value of the ecological efficiency function is also slightly smaller. As the amount of fertilizer applied increases, the crop yield increases. Excessive application of fertilizer not only limits crop growth but also reduces fertilizer utilization efficiency, leading to a series of environmental problems, such as increased greenhouse gas emissions and water resource pollution. From the perspective of water resource efficiency, when irrigation water consumption is arbitrarily combined with three objective functions, the objective function values have no obvious characteristics. Fig. 5(d) shows that under the four target scenarios, the overall increase in net output value is 6.13%, the overall increase in total yield is 1.31%, the overall decrease in fertilizer application is 2.42%, and the overall decrease in irrigation water consumption is 29.02%. When considering all objectives comprehensively, due to the competitive relationship between them, their benefit values do not reach the optimal effect. 3.3. Analysis of planting area adjustment in different scenarios Since it is not suitable for different regions to adjust the corresponding planting structure after considering all objectives, the data of 15 scenarios are substituted into the NSGA-III algorithm for analysis, and suitable schemes are selected according to local conditions. The results of the optimal scheme of agricultural planting structure under different scenarios are shown in Table 3. Notably, since multiobjective problems cannot obtain unique solutions, there may be multiple sets of solutions on the Pareto front. Therefore, in response to the current planting situation in Heilongjiang Province, under the premise of ensuring that the objective function value is the Pareto-optimal solution, the group with relatively small changes in planting area is selected. Combined with the ecological environment protection policies in Heilongjiang Province, the group with the highest ecological benefits was selected when the changes in planting area were generally similar. Table 3. Optimal plan for agricultural planting structure under different scenarios (Unit: hm2). Scenario Existing planting situation After optimization Rice Soybean Corn Rice Soybean Corn S1 365,702 30,088 40,113 374,934 36,188 24,780 S2 366,822 31,472 37,609 S3 364,319 31,614 39,969 S4 361,389 36,756 37,757 S5 375,249 31,581 29,073 S6 368,348 35,028 32,526 S7 362,710 24,925 48,268 S8 376,759 30,326 28,817 S9 364,610 34,422 36,870 S10 364,438 32,530 38,934 S11 374,636 28,241 33,026 S12 369,143 35,755 31,005 S13 368,330 33,656 33,916 S14 371,286 26,024 38,593 S15 369,073 31,726 35,103 Table 3 shows that among the 15 scenarios, S3, S4, S7, S9, and S10 reduce the rice planting area; S7, S11, and S14 reduce the soybean planting area; and S7 increases the corn planting area. The optimization trend of the agricultural planting structure in Heilongjiang Province is to increase the planting area of rice and soybeans and reduce the planting area of corn. From the perspective of rice, the irrigation water consumption target has a significant inhibitory effect on the planting area, but when comprehensively considered, its inhibitory effect is weakened to a certain extent, which conforms to the changing pattern. When irrigation water consumption has an inhibitory effect on rice, multiple types of corn can be selected to compensate for economic benefits. When it does not produce inhibitory effects, multiple types of rice can continue to maintain economic benefits. If we consider the total yield objective function or the fertilizer application objective function again, we can consider adjusting the planting ratio of rice and soybean appropriately to achieve optimal treatment for multiple objectives in the region. To more intuitively demonstrate the changes in planting area before and after multiobjective optimization, 15 scenarios were compared with existing planting situations to obtain the optimal crop area changes under different scenarios. The results are shown in Fig. 6. Download : Download high-res image (296KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 6. Changes in crop area under the optimal planting mode in different scenarios. Fig. 6 shows that S9 has the highest changes in total area, rice area, and corn area. S10 has the smallest changes in total area and corn area. The smallest change in rice area is in S7, while the largest and smallest changes in soybean area are in S6 and S3, respectively. Because the main planting area in Heilongjiang Province is rice, 8 of 12 irrigation areas are located in the Sanjiang Plain, where most of the area is composed of paddy fields. Excessive adjustment of the rice area will lead to a deviation in the overall planting structure of Heilongjiang Province. However, the relatively small change in rice leads to a significant change rate for soybeans and corn with relatively small planting volumes. Therefore, rice is the crop with the largest amount of change and the smallest rate of change in the optimization and adjustment of agricultural planting structure in the 12 sample irrigation areas in Heilongjiang Province. Adjustments in the area of three crops to extreme values is often considered a double objective function or even a single objective function. When three objective functions or even four objective functions are simultaneously used, the area adjustment situation is actually smaller. This shows that when more objective functions are considered, the effect can be achieved by adjusting the planting area relatively less to achieve the relatively optimal objective function value. However, when fewer objective functions are considered, it is necessary to adjust the planting area according to different scenarios or make minimal or maximum adjustments to the planting area to achieve a better objective function value. 3.4. Spatial analysis of agricultural planting structure under multiple scenarios To visually display the spatial changes in agricultural planting structure in Heilongjiang Province, specific data from 12 irrigation areas were substituted into the NSGA-III algorithm to obtain the adjustments of the planting areas for 3 crops in 12 irrigation areas under 15 scenarios. The results are shown in Fig. 7. Download : Download high-res image (2MB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 7. Change in area of optimal planting patterns in sample irrigation areas under different scenarios. Among the four irrigation areas in the Songnen Plain, in the Chahayang irrigation area (Fig. 7a), 4 out of 15 scenarios consider increases in the planting area of corn, of which 3 consider irrigation water consumption. Among the 9 growth scenarios for rice, 7 include the total yield objective function. Except for S5, all scenarios that consider the total yield objective function require increases in the planting area of rice. This finding demonstrates that the total yield objective function in the Chahayang Irrigation District plays an important role in adjusting the rice planting area and the irrigation water consumption objective function in adjusting the corn planting area. From an overall perspective, the adjustment trend in the Chahayang Irrigation District involves reductions in the planting of corn and increases in the planting of rice and soybeans. Because the Chahayang Irrigation District is located between the Nomin River and the Allen River, with well-developed water systems and good soil water-saving conditions, it is appropriate to consider the impact of reductions in the irrigation water consumption objective function on the adjustment of its planting structure. Therefore, the Chahayang Irrigation District should reduce the planting of corn and increase the planting area of rice and soybeans. The Tailai Irrigation District (Fig. 7b) shows a reduction in corn cultivation in all scenarios, with 11 out of 15 scenarios reducing soybean cultivation and all scenarios increasing rice cultivation. The graph shows that in the Tailai Irrigation District, the change in soybean planting area does not play a critical regulatory role but only serves as an auxiliary regulatory role. Therefore, the future planting mode in the Tailai Irrigation District should reduce the planting of corn and increase the planting of rice. In the Fuyu irrigation area (Fig. 7c), except for S7, the planting area of corn is reduced. The majority of the reduced corn planting area should be used to grow rice, while a small portion should be used to grow soybean. In S7, to reduce the rice planting area, the soybean and corn areas should be increased by almost same amount. In the Yi'an Irrigation District (Fig. 7d), except for S9, in all situations, the planting of corn should be reduced and the planting of rice should be increased. Among the 15 scenarios, only 2 were designed to reduce soybean cultivation, and all considered the objective function of fertilizer application. When more target factors are considered, the growth of the soybean planting area is greater. A vertical comparison of the four irrigation areas on the Songnen Plain indicates that the Yi'an irrigation area has the highest growth rate of soybean planting, and its proportion of optimized adjustment of planting area increases compared to the other three irrigation areas. Looking at the four irrigation areas in the Songnen Plain, the overall goal is to reduce the planting area of corn and increase the planting area of rice. In most scenarios, the planting area of soybeans plays a regulatory role and accounts for a relatively small proportion of the adjustment. Among the eight irrigation areas in the Sanjiang Plain, the Qixing irrigation area (Fig. 7e) generally presents a reduction in maize planting area and an increase in rice and soybean planting area. Among the six scenarios where the planting area of rice increases, there are five cases where the total yield objective function is considered, and all of these involve a combination of multiple objectives. Among the six scenarios where the planting area of soybeans decreases, there are four cases where the objective function of irrigation water consumption is considered. Among the four multiobjective combination forms, three groups consider the objective function of irrigation water consumption. Therefore, in the Qixing Irrigation District, when the multiobjective combination form does not consider the objective function of irrigation water consumption, the planting area of soybeans can be increased. The Erdaohe Irrigation District (Fig. 7f) needs to reduce the planting area of rice in all 15 scenarios, with the planting area of soybeans reduced in 4 scenarios and the planting area of corn reduced in 3 scenarios. However, in the scenario of soybean and corn reductions, the reduction area is lower than that of rice. Therefore, the future planting model of the Erdaohe Irrigation District should entail moderate reductions in the planting area of rice and increases in the planting of corn and soybean. The overall situation of the Daxing Irrigation District (Fig. 7g) entails increase in the planting area of rice and corn and reductions in the planting area of soybeans. Among the four scenarios where soybeans increased, three considered the objective function of irrigation water consumption, while among the seven scenarios where corn decreased, five considered the objective function of irrigation water consumption. This finding further shows that irrigation water consumption plays an important role in adjusting the planting area in the Daxing Irrigation District. The Jiangchuan Irrigation District (Fig. 7h) needs to reduce the planting area of rice and increase the planting area of soybeans and corn in all 15 scenarios. The main reason is that the original planting mode of the Jiangchuan Irrigation District has a very small proportion of soybeans and corn. Therefore, in the adjustment process, it is necessary to increase the planting area of soybeans and corn appropriately according to different scenarios. The Wutong River irrigation area (Fig. 7i) needs to reduce the planting area of corn in 15 scenarios, most of which need to reduce the planting area of corn and increase the planting area of rice and soybean, and a few of which need to reduce the planting area of soybean and corn and increase the planting area of rice. The overall trend is that the more objective functions are considered, the smaller the adjustment of planting area. The overall presentation of the 15 scenarios in the Xingkaihu Irrigation District (Fig. 7j) indicates that the planting of rice should be reduced and the planting area of soybeans and corn should be increased. Except for S6 and S15, where the planting area of rice and soybeans is reduced to increase the planting area of corn, in all other scenarios, the planting area of rice is reduced to ensure the planting of large beans and corn. The overall situation of the Suibin Irrigation District (Fig. 7k) requires reductions in the planting area of rice and increases in the planting area of soybeans and corn. Among the four scenarios for rice growth, there are three that consider only a single target; among the five scenarios for corn reduction, there are also three that consider only a single target. Therefore, in the Suibin Irrigation District, when a multiobjective situation is considered, the planting area of rice should be reduced, and the planting of corn should be increased. When a single target is considered, only the target situation can be considered. The overall situation of the 859 irrigation area (Fig. 7l) requires increases in the planting area of rice and corn and reductions in the planting area of soybeans. Among them, in three cases of rice reduction, three cases of soybean growth, and seven cases of corn growth, the objective function of irrigation water consumption is considered. The 859 irrigation area is near mountains and rivers, with dense water systems and good water retention. If the irrigation water consumption objective function is not considered, it is recommended to increase the planting area of rice and moderately reduce the planting area of soybeans and corn. In summary, the eight irrigation areas in the Sanjiang Plain have shown an overall increase in soybean planting area and a decrease in rice and corn planting area. Compared to the Songnen Plain, the Sanjiang Plain irrigation areas have a higher complexity of changes and weaker regularity. The comprehensive optimization benefits of agricultural planting structure, adjustment of planting area under different scenarios, and spatial analysis of agricultural planting structure under multiple scenarios can provide the following suggestions: The scientific allocation of crop spatial patterns should not only meet the requirements of local natural ecosystems but also leverage the advantages of agricultural resources according to local conditions to achieve good economic results. Based on the characteristics of grain crop cultivation in different regions, the government can effectively promote the transformation of the local planting structure and promote the structural reform of the agricultural supply side by taking water-saving irrigation measures as the starting point. In corn planting areas with water scarcity, the government can increase the rice planting area by investing in water-saving irrigation projects or guiding farmers to adopt water-saving technologies, thereby steadily increasing the net output value of the area. In addition to water-saving irrigation measures, price factors, grain production policies, climate change, and individual characteristics of farmers impact changes in the grain planting area. For example, the changes in precipitation and temperature caused by climate change will lead to an increase in the planting area of corn and soybeans, as well as a decrease in the planting area of rice. 4. Discussion To further explore the constraint effect of water resource system resilience, based on the existing planting structure models in Heilongjiang Province, four objective functions were synthesized, and S15 was taken as an example to compare and analyze the specific impact of water resource system resilience constraints on the adjustment of agricultural planting structure in irrigation areas. The calculation results are shown in Table 4. Table 4. Objective function values and changes in the overall planting area of irrigation areas with and without resilience constraints. Comparison project With resilience constraints Without resilience constraints Net output value (yuan) 4.5 × 109 4.6 × 109 Total yield (kg) 3.86 × 109 3.89 × 109 Fertilizer application amount (kg) 1.445 × 108 1.45 × 108 Irrigation water consumption (m3) 2.03 × 109 2.12 × 109 Overall change in decision variables (hm2) 29712.02 37035.78 Change in rice area (hm2) 11122.42 13838.38 Change in soybean area (hm2) 7509.862 7832.478 Change in corn area (hm2) 11079.74 15364.91 Table 4 shows that in terms of net output value and total yield, the objective function values without the constraint of water resource system resilience are greater than those obtained under the constraint of water resource system resilience. In terms of the fertilizer application rate, the objective function values are almost equal in both cases, while in terms of irrigation water consumption, the objective function values without the constraint of water resource system resilience are significantly greater than those under the constraint of water resource system resilience. The adjustment of the total area without constraints and the adjustments of rice, soybean, and corn are greater than those with constraints. Taking S15 as an example, the optimization results of the agricultural planting structure in each irrigation area were calculated under two scenarios, as shown in Table 5, Table 6. Both cases involved converting a portion of the corn planting area to rice and soybean planting areas. However, the difference is that when there is no resilience constraint, the planting area of corn decreases more, and the percentage of transfer to rice is much greater than when there is a resilience constraint. The reason for this is that when constraining the resilience of water resource systems, due to the mutual inhibition between objective functions, as water resource benefits are effectively improved, social and economic benefits and agricultural production benefits are reduced to a certain extent. Due to the high economic benefits of rice among grain crops, the current oversupply of corn has led to a significant increase in inventory, reduced planting efficiency, and an increasingly prominent issue of increased production without increased income. Moreover, the problems of pesticide residues and soil nutrient imbalance caused by continuous cropping of corn cannot be ignored. After increases in the constraint of water resource resilience, due to the good water quality of rice, the planting area of corn converted into rice and soybean decreases compared to that without the constraint of water resource resilience. Thus, for the 12 sample irrigation areas in Heilongjiang Province, in both cases, the planting area of rice and soybean should be increased appropriately, while the planting area of corn should be reduced. Under the constraint of resilience, irrigation water consumption should be reduced, and the net output value and total yield should be reduced appropriately to ensure that the level of resilience of the water resource system is greater than or equal to level III.

Among them, the four irrigation areas in the Songnen Plain all increase the rice planting area. In terms of adjusting the soybean planting area, when there is a resilience constraint, five irrigation areas show a decreasing trend, with 2 in the Songnen Plain irrigation area and 3 in the Sanjiang Plain irrigation area. When there is no resilience constraint, four irrigation areas show a decreasing trend, with 1 in the Songnen Plain irrigation area and 3 in the Sanjiang Plain irrigation area. Among them, the Daxing Irrigation Area and Bawujiu Irrigation Area significantly decrease. In terms of adjusting the planting area of corn, when there are resilience constraints, five irrigation areas show an increasing trend, all of which are Sanjiang Plain irrigation areas. When there is no resilience constraint, six irrigation areas show a growth trend, all of which are Sanjiang Plain irrigation areas, but their area growth is much smaller than the reduction area. In summary, the presence or absence of resilience constraints has no significant impact on the adjustment of rice planting area. For the Songnen Plain, an irrigation area with resilience constraints and an increase in soybean planting area has no significant impact on corn planting area. For the Sanjiang Plain, an irrigation area with resilience constraints and an increase in corn planting area has no significant impact on soybean planting area. From an overall perspective, the presence or absence of resilience constraints does not have a significant impact on the overall trend of change, but it has a significant impact on the specific adjustment of planting area changes. Unlike previous studies on the optimization and adjustment of agricultural planting structure, in this study, optimization and evaluation are combined to a certain extent in the process of exploring the optimization and adjustment of agricultural planting structure in sample irrigation areas of Heilongjiang Province under the constraints of water resource system resilience and other conditions. In the analysis process, the emphasis was placed on the improvement of benefits brought about by optimization and adjustment, the adjustment of planting area in different scenarios, the adjustment of planting area in different irrigation areas under different scenarios, and the impact of water resource system resilience on the optimization and adjustment of planting structure. In terms of evaluation, the emphasis is on demonstrating the adjustment of planting area obtained through the NSGA3 algorithm and, based on this, conducting multiangle analysis. In terms of optimization, the emphasis is mainly reflected in the increased benefits of the four objective functions brought about by the adjustment of planting area in the irrigation area. The adjustment of planting area obtained through the NSGA3 algorithm can effectively analyze the increase in benefits brought by the adjustment, further deepening the connection between optimization and evaluation. The optimization of agricultural planting structure in irrigation areas under multiobjective conditions is a hot and difficult issue. However, limitations in data acquisition, insufficient selection of indicators, insufficient consideration of natural factors such as climate change and precipitation conditions, and insufficient time series may impact the results. In the future, the increasing improvement in soil and water environmental monitoring data in irrigation areas will promote the effective resolution of scientific issues related to the optimization of agricultural planting structure in irrigation areas. 5. Conclusion This study aims to address the drawbacks of imperfect constraint conditions in previous agricultural planting structure optimization models, which can easily lead to unreasonable optimization results. Taking 12 sample irrigation areas, such as the Chahayang Irrigation District in Heilongjiang Province, as examples, the constraint values were determined based on data from 2007 to 2016, and the 2016 data were used as reference values for analysis. A multiobjective optimization model based on regional conditions was developed, with rice, soybeans, and corn as decision variables; net output value, total yield, fertilizer application amount, and irrigation water consumption as objective functions; and water resource system resilience as constraints. The NSGA III algorithm was used to optimize the agricultural planting structure of 12 sample irrigation areas under the constraint of water resource system resilience, and the following conclusions were obtained: (1) From the perspective of optimizing the benefits of agricultural planting, considering only a single objective, the function values adjusted for planting area were much better than those before optimization. After considering multiple objectives, the net output value representing social benefits increased by 4.72%–9.43%, the total output growth representing agricultural production benefits remained between 0.79% and 2.36%, the decrease in fertilizer application representing ecological benefits remained between 2.03% and 4.73%, and the overall decrease in irrigation water consumption representing water resource benefits was 26.92%–29.02%. (2) Through specific analysis of 15 scenarios, the area change of the optimal planting mode under different scenarios was determined. The results showed that S9 had the largest changes in total area, rice area, and corn area. S10 had the smallest changes in total area and corn area. The smallest change in rice area was in S7, while the largest and smallest changes in soybean area are in S6 and S3, respectively. From the perspective of specific changes in planting area under different scenarios, when considering 15 scenarios comprehensively, the overall trend in Heilongjiang Province is to increase the planting area of rice and soybeans and reduce the planting area of corn. (3) The analysis results of the NSGA-III algorithm were applied to 12 irrigation areas to further analyze the spatial change characteristics of the agricultural planting structure in Heilongjiang Province from the perspective of spatial transformation. The overall trend of the four irrigation areas in the Songnen Plain was a reduction in the planting area of corn and an increase in the planting area of rice. In most scenarios, the soybean planting area played a regulatory role and accounted for a small proportion of the adjustment. Eight irrigation areas in the Sanjiang Plain required an overall increase in soybean planting area and a decrease in rice and corn planting area. Compared to the Songnen Plain, the changes in the Sanjiang Plain irrigation areas were complex and had weak regularity. (4) From the perspective of the constraint effect of water resource system resilience, increases in resilience constraints had a negative impact on the net output value and total yield in the objective function, a significant positive impact on irrigation water consumption, and little impact on fertilizer application. Simultaneously, increases in the resilience constraint effectively reduced the adjustment of the planting area to achieve a relatively optimal situation. For the adjustment of the planting area of the three crops, increases in resilience constraints had a small impact on the planting area of corn and soybean but no significant impact on the planting area of rice.

Abstract: Globally, the irrigation of crops is the largest consumptive user of fresh water. Water scarcity
is increasing worldwide, resulting in tighter regulation of its use for agriculture. This necessitates the
development of irrigation practices that are more efﬁcient in the use of water but do not compromise
crop quality and yield. Precision irrigation already achieves this goal, in part. The goal of precision
irrigation is to accurately supply the crop water need in a timely manner and as spatially uniformly
as possible. However, to maximize the beneﬁts of precision irrigation, additional technologies need
to be enabled and incorporated into agriculture. This paper discusses how incorporating adaptive
decision support systems into precision irrigation management will enable signiﬁcant advances in
increasing the efﬁciency of current irrigation approaches. From the literature review, it is found that
precision irrigation can be applied in achieving the environmental goals related to sustainability.
The demonstrated economic beneﬁts of precision irrigation in ﬁeld-scale crop production is however
minimal. It is argued that a proper combination of soil, plant and weather sensors providing
real-time data to an adaptive decision support system provides an innovative platform for improving
sustainability in irrigated agriculture. The review also shows that adaptive decision support systems
based on model predictive control are able to adequately account for the time-varying nature of the
soil–plant–atmosphere system while considering operational limitations and agronomic objectives
in arriving at optimal irrigation decisions. It is concluded that signiﬁcant improvements in crop
yield and water savings can be achieved by incorporating model predictive control into precision
irrigation decision support tools. Further improvements in water savings can also be realized by
including deﬁcit irrigation as part of the overall irrigation management strategy. Nevertheless, future
research is needed for identifying crop response to regulated water deﬁcits, developing improved
soil moisture and plant sensors, and developing self-learning crop simulation frameworks that can
be applied to evaluate adaptive decision support strategies related to irrigation.

1. Introduction
Globally, 70% of water use is applied in irrigation of crops, making irrigation the largest
consumptive user of fresh water [1]. Over 80% of freshwater withdrawals in developing countries is
applied in irrigation [2]. Irrigated agriculture provides 40% of the world’s food from less than 20% of
the cultivated area highlighting the importance of irrigation in global food security [3].

Irrigated crop production globally extends over 275 million hectares, with an estimated annual
increase of 1.3% [2]. Global climate change may further increase irrigation water demand due to a
greater variation in annual precipitation amounts [4]. Postel [5] suggested that irrigation will provide
46% of the global crop water requirement by 2025, which was computed as 28% in 1995, resulting in a
decline of rain-fed agriculture. Food production in the developing world, notably in South, Southeast
and East Asia, is at present heavily reliant on irrigation. The total irrigated area in Asia is 230 million ha,
which represents over 70% of the global irrigated area. Of the 230 million ha of irrigated land area, 60%
is located in China and India [3]. It is estimated that 75% of the grain production in China is dependent
on irrigation [2]. Sarma [6] noted that India uses as much as four times more water to produce one
unit of a major food crop as compared to the USA and Europe. This implies that an improvement
in water use efﬁciency in the developing world would conserve at least half of the water presently
applied in irrigation.
It is estimated that a water volume of 2630 km3 is abstracted yearly from surface and ground
water sources for irrigated crop production. The absence of surface water sources in a number of
communities has further increased the pressure on groundwater resources. This has resulted in the
over-abstraction of global groundwater sources which is calculated to be as much as 163 km3 per
annum [2]. A global shortage in freshwater sources is predicted unless action is taken to improve water
management and increase water use efﬁciency. This has necessitated greater regulatory demands for
environmental protection of freshwater [7]. It is reported that only half of the total freshwater volume
abstracted for irrigation globally reaches the targeted crops [2]. These have brought about the need to
devise procedures to use the limited water more efﬁciently while maximizing crop yield and quality.
Conventional irrigation practice involves applying water uniformly over every part of the ﬁeld
without taking into account the spatial variability in soil and crop water needs; this consequently leads
to overirrigation in some parts of the ﬁeld while other parts of the ﬁeld are underirrigated [8]. The risks
associated with overirrigation include surface runoff, deep percolation and leaching of nitrates and
nutrients. Those associated with underirrigation are more subjective and include reduction in crop
yields and quality, as well as inefﬁcient use of fertilizer and other supplemental inputs for crop
production [9].
The irrigation process requires a high level of ‘precision’ in order to optimize the water input
and crop response, while minimizing adverse environmental impacts. Precision irrigation is an
evolving ﬁeld with active interest by both industry and academic researchers. It is conceptualized by
some researchers as the use of efﬁcient irrigation application systems, whereas others view it as the
variable application of irrigation based on predeﬁned maps or sensor feedback [10]. Smith et al. [11]
suggested that ‘precision’ involves the accurate determination, quantiﬁcation of crop water needs and
the precise application of the optimal water volume at the required time. This implies that varying
water application spatially is not the sole requirement for the achievement of ‘precision’ in the irrigation
process. Hence, precision irrigation can be deﬁned as the process of accounting for the ﬁeld-scale
spatial variability in crop water need and applying the right amount of water to match the spatial crop
water need at the right time [9]. The advantages associated with precision irrigation include increased
crop yields, improved crop quality, improved water use efﬁciency/savings, reduction of energy costs
and reduction of adverse environmental impacts [12]. Pierce [13] viewed precision irrigation as a
tool for improving sustainability in irrigated agriculture in terms of improved irrigation water use
efﬁciency and improved environmental quality of irrigated ﬁelds.
The balance of several core aspects is however important for the successful implementation of
a robust precision irrigation system. Implementing a precision irrigation system involves efforts on
real-time monitoring of crop and soil conditions, scheduling irrigation and control of the irrigation
application equipment. Research has been mainly focused on the sensing and control aspects of
precision irrigation with much advancements in the last decade [12]. Research is limited, however,
in the development of appropriate irrigation scheduling tools for the precision irrigation process [14].
Irrigation scheduling is the process by which a producer determines when to apply irrigation and
Sustainability 2017, 9, 353

the amount of irrigation water to apply [15]. Hornbuckle et al. [16] suggested that the irrigation
scheduling endeavour should be treated as an all-encompassing decision support system for irrigation
management. A robust decision support system is important in the successful implementation of
precision irrigation. The need for a decision support system capable of real-time management decisions
of when, where and how much to irrigate while also considering uncertainty in climatic inputs,
the time-varying nature of cropping systems, as well as equipment and operational limitations cannot
be overemphasized. Rhodig and Hillyer [17] noted that the development of an optimal decision support
tool for precision irrigation will involve the combination of appropriate modeling and management
tools. The decision support tools available for precision irrigation management are presently inﬂexible
and difﬁcult to adapt to varying cropping scenarios [18].
In recent years, there has been a number of in-depth reviews on precision irrigation (e.g., [9,16]),
and our intention is not to repeat the areas they addressed. Rather, our aim is to provide an in-depth
technical analysis of the considerations necessary for the development of a practical and robust decision
support system for precision irrigation in order to improve sustainable irrigated agriculture. To that
end, the review will focus on the following critical aspects of precision irrigation: (1) monitoring
considerations; (2) present limitations and state of the art in decision support; and (3) opportunities for
improving sustainability. We will however include brief sections on the concept of spatial variability
and the control of water application in precision irrigation.
2. Spatial Variability: The Long-Term Challenge of Irrigated Agriculture
The underlying argument for precision irrigation is the presence of within-ﬁeld spatial variability
that inﬂuences crop water demand. The spatial variability in crop water demand may have a direct
inﬂuence on the crop yield, quality and the environmental quality of irrigated ﬁelds [19]. The soil water
presents the sole source of water available for direct plant uptake and therefore its spatial variability
will have a direct inﬂuence on crop water demand. Soil and landscape characteristics like soil texture,
topography, abiotic and management factors (e.g., compaction, tillage) and hydraulic properties vary
spatially across a ﬁeld [11]. These have a direct inﬂuence on the water-holding capacity of the soil.
Hedley and Yule [20] reported that the spatial variation in the soil water retention characteristics was
strongly correlated with the spatial variation in soil texture across a ﬁeld, noting that areas with heavier
soils within a ﬁeld had a larger water-holding capacity in comparison to those with light textured
soils. The advent of rapid non-invasive technologies for mapping soil properties, speciﬁcally electrical
conductivity mapping, can reveal within-ﬁeld variability that can guide in variable rate irrigation
management. These have been successfully applied by Hedley and Yule [21] and Daccache et al. [8].
Readers are directed to [22,23] for a comprehensive overview of electrical conductivity mapping.
The variability in yield across a ﬁeld has also been found to be strongly correlated with the spatial
variability in water available for crop use. The spatial variability in crop yield is a function of the
interplay between water stress, nutrients, in addition to soil’s physical and chemical properties [24].
The yield map can be correlated with the soil electrical conductivity (EC) map. These similarities can be
explained through the spatial variability of soil properties that exists across a ﬁeld. The water-holding
capacity of the soil is a major factor affecting yield, and the yield map will likely show a strong
correlation to soil EC [25]. Irmak et al. [26] noted that the spatial variability in soil water retention
characteristics played a dominant role in explaining the spatial yield variability observed in soybean.
Martinez-Casasnovas et al. [27] suggested yield mapping as an important tool in variable rate
irrigation management.
A robust precision irrigation system will be able to meet the spatially varying crop water demand
across a ﬁeld at the right time. This requires accurate knowledge of the within-ﬁeld variability. This
is addressed by applying the concept of irrigation management zones/units in precision irrigation.
The irrigation management zones are a group of homogeneous units with similar soil water retention
characteristics [21]. It is however important that these management zones are large enough to be
managed individually while remaining relatively homogeneous in order to reﬂect the spatial soil
Sustainability 2017, 9, 353

variation across the units. The delineation of irrigation management zones based on real-time sensor
data has also been demonstrated. This is achieved by applying infrared thermometry/thermography
to assess the spatial variation in crop canopy temperature across a ﬁeld [28]. The crop canopy
temperature of a healthy transpiring crop will often be less than that of the ambient air. When crop
transpiration is reduced as a result of water deﬁcits, the crop canopy temperature is expected to increase.
The characterization of crop water status as a function of the canopy and ambient temperature is the
basis for using infrared thermometry/thermography as a mapping tool for precision irrigation [29].
Shaughnessy et al. [30] and Evett et al. [31] have successfully applied this procedure in generating
dynamic maps to guide variable rate water application for ﬁeld crops grown under a center pivot
system. It should, however, be noted that infrared temperature measurements are usually taken over
a short period, mostly at midday when the crop is expected to experience the highest evaporative
demand. Hence, this method is well suited for crop production systems in which the soil moisture
dynamics has relatively long time constants.
3. Spatial Scales of Irrigation Management
Centre pivot, lateral move and low energy precision application (LEPA) moving machines can be
modiﬁed to apply spatially variable irrigation [32]. These systems are particularly suited to variable
rate water application because of their current level of automation and large coverage area with
a single lateral pipe. Fixed irrigation systems also have potential to be deployed for variable rate
water application as they can be very accurate and can be automated based on sensor feedback [2].
Implementing a spatially varied irrigation system requires an understanding of the characteristics of
the irrigation application system deployed including the spatial scales covered by the water application
equipment. The spatial scale associated with the variability in crop water requirements and its impact
on yield should also be identiﬁed [32].
O’Shaughnessy et al. [33] suggested that the size and numbers of irrigation management zones
that can be controlled in a precision irrigation strategy will determine the overall ﬂexibility of the
system. For moving application systems, the width of the management zone is dependent on the
number of drops or nozzles within an individually controlled set (i.e., sprinklers controlled by a single
solenoid valve) and the length will be dependent on the pattern of variability in the direction of the
traveling sprinkler. The wind speed and the overlap from the wetted sprinkler patterns between
management zones will also affect the accuracy of the water volume applied. Raine and McCarthy [32]
noted that the spray diameter and overlap achieved by moving application systems make it impossible
to target water applications on a single crop basis using these systems. Hedley et al. [2] suggested that
the economic beneﬁts of spatially varied irrigation should be an important consideration even when
the system is considered achievable from a technical standpoint. The spatial scales associated with
moving and ﬁxed irrigation systems is presented in Table 1. Smith et al. [11] concluded that the spatial
resolution of a precision irrigation system will be inﬂuenced by the spatial scales associated with the
application system, spatial resolution of the inﬁeld sensors and the spatial scales associated with the
variability in crop water requirements.

4. Control of Water Application in Precision Irrigation
The water application system used in the precision irrigation process must be able to control the
water application volume applied per unit time to each deﬁned irrigation management unit within a
ﬁeld [13]. The development of variable rate water application systems has been mostly focused on
continuous move systems [11].
The control of water application on continuous move systems (centre pivot, linear move, boom
and reel) is based on databases of spatially referenced data deﬁning irrigation management units [20].
The volume of water applied to each management unit can be achieved by varying the application rate
of sprinklers or controlling the ground speed of continuous move systems [13].
The application rate of sprinklers is mostly varied through the pulse modulation of the sprinkler
nozzles. This involves the application of normally opened solenoid valves to control ﬂow through
an individual or group of sprinkler heads. The solenoid turns the ﬂow of water either on or off at
a sprinkler location in order to achieve a desired application depth within a speciﬁed cycle time.
The cycle time is the total number of switching (either to on or off phase) required by the solenoid
valves during a pulse cycle [34]. Evans et al. [34] applied the pulse modulated sprinkler control
on a linear move sprinkler system. Daccache et al. [8] also applied a pulsed modulated sprinkler
control on a boom and reel irrigation system. Field evaluation of both systems indicated a satisfactory
performance over a range of water application rates. They however noted a problem with sprinkler
overlap at the edge of the irrigation management units.
The variation in irrigation volume applied by a continuous move system can also be achieved by
varying its travel speed. The sprinklers on the manifold of the irrigation system are usually operated
at a speciﬁed ﬂow rate and pressure. An increase in travel speed of the system reduces the application
depth and a decrease in the travel speed increases the application depth [35]. This type of system
cannot be applied in situations where variable application depths are needed along the length of the
irrigation system [34]. Al-Karadsheh [9] evaluated the performance of speed control in achieving
variable water application rate on a linear move system. The wetted diameter of the sprinklers was
reported to be between 15.2 and 21.3 m. He reported that the system needed to travel a minimum
distance of 16 m before a desired change in application volume can be reached. This suggests that this
system is not suitable for use in applications where the management units are small in scale.
The adaptation of ﬁxed irrigation systems for variable rate water application has been achieved
(e.g., [36]). Variable water rate application in these systems is usually achieved either by individual
nozzle or emitter control, or zone management [13]. Readers are referred to [13] for a comprehensive
review of such systems. Miranda et al. [37] described a distributed control system implemented to
achieve variable rate water application in a ﬁxed irrigation system operating in predeﬁned management
zones. Their results indicated that the system was able to apply the irrigation volume required in
each zone. Goumopoulos et al. [38] also implemented a variable rate water application setup for a
ﬁxed irrigation system capable of zone-speciﬁc irrigation of strawberries. Individual nozzle control
in a micro-sprinkler system has been demonstrated by Coates et al. [39]. They reported individual
control of 54 nodes in a vineyard with the system. The nozzle connected to each node was capable of
achieving a unique water application volume. They concluded that the water requirements of each
deﬁned zone in the vineyard can be individually met by the irrigation system. The authors reported a
payback period of between 3.5 and 4.5 years for the system.
5. Monitoring
The routine or continuous monitoring of moisture ﬂuxes in the soil–plant–atmosphere system is a
fundamental aspect of managing crop production in irrigated agriculture. Monitoring can essentially
be viewed as the application of various sensing technologies in determining and characterizing
the spatiotemporal ﬁeld-scale moisture dynamics and plant water use. These sensing methods can
be classiﬁed under three broad headings: soil-based, weather-based and plant-based sensing [40].
Soil-based sensing typically involves the use of sensors to determine the soil moisture content or
Sustainability 2017, 9, 353
6 of 29
potential. This information is then used to infer the amount of water available for plant use and
its temporal dynamics. The weather-based sensing involves the use of the crop evapotranspiration
to determine the temporal crop water use. The evapotranspiration is determined using climatic
variables such as radiation, rainfall and wind speed [41,42]. The plant-based sensing involves the
determination of plant water status which is usually related to plant physiology. Measurements
of canopy temperature, stomatal resistance, sap ﬂow, leaf turgor pressure, stem diameter and leaf
thickness are used to infer plant water status [43].
Recent advances in remote sensing has enhanced the possibility of monitoring the spatial nature of
both soil and crop water status. Remote sensing encompasses non-contact technologies that are capable
of sensing radiation reﬂected or emitted from agricultural ﬁelds. They are deployed using satellites,
aerial platforms and tractors [44]. These technologies have a high spatial resolution and are well suited
for regional soil and crop water evaluation [45]. This review focuses on sensing technologies that can
be applied in monitoring ﬁeld-scale soil and crop water dynamics. Readers are referred to [44,46] for a
comprehensive review of remote sensing technologies applicable in precision agriculture.
5.1. Soil-Based Sensing
The knowledge of soil moisture ﬂuxes comprising of the depletion and reﬁll of soil water can be
used to monitor crop water use hence making it a useful tool in irrigation scheduling and management
decisions [47]. Several methods have been developed for measuring soil moisture content; they are
indirect methods which rely on the strong relationship between a particular property of the soil
and the soil moisture content. Moreover, they are able to provide continuous monitoring and are
non-destructive [48]. In precision irrigation, the commonly applied method for monitoring the
temporal dynamics of ﬁeld-scale soil moisture is the dielectric-based method [20]. This is because
of the ease of their deployment in large-scale soil moisture sensor networks [49]. Thus, the proper
deployment and management of this technology can optimize the sustainability of irrigated agriculture.
Consequently, this section will outline a brief description of this method including a consideration of
the factors affecting sensor performance. For a more detailed description of other state-of-the-art soil
moisture sensing technologies, readers are referred to [50,51].
5.1.1. Dielectric Soil Moisture Sensors
Dielectric soil moisture sensors operate by exploiting the dielectric properties of soil and its
constituents [52]. The relative dielectric permittivity of a substance is used to describe the effect of
an electromagnetic ﬁeld on its molecular structure. It is a dimensionless constant greater than one,
made up of a real and imaginary part [53]. The apparent relative dielectric permittivity of soil, ε′soil
is a function of its constituents majorly being water, air and solid particles. The relative dielectric
permittivity of the other constituents except water has a negligible effect as they have small values in
the range of 1–7. The one of water, ε′water having a value of approximately 80 has the most remarkable
effect. It is therefore possible to correlate the volumetric moisture content (VMC) to ε′soil using
empirical equations at a frequency range of between 50 MHz and 17 GHz. At this high frequency
range, ε′soil is highly stable and it usually referred to as the apparent dielectric permittivity of soil [54].
A range of electromagnetic sensors exploits this property to provide a non-destructive in situ
measurement of soil moisture contents. They include time domain reﬂectometry (TDR) sensors, time
domain transmission (TDT) sensors and capacitance sensors.
5.1.2. Factors Affecting the Performance of Dielectric Soil Moisture Sensors
The accuracy of data from soil moisture sensors is important in the precision irrigation process.
Over estimation of soil moisture status may lead to a delay in irrigation scheduling decisions and
consequently affect crop yield and quality. Underestimation of soil moisture status on the other hand
may lead to application of irrigation too often or when not required by the crops. This will result in
water/energy wastage and adverse environmental effects.
Sustainability 2017, 9, 353
7 of 29
Dielectric soil moisture sensors measure the soil moisture content for the soil volume
corresponding to their sphere of inﬂuence. The various factors affecting the performance of dielectric
soil moisture sensors include bulk electrical conductivity (salinity), soil texture, bulk density and
temperature. A variation in any of these factors around the sphere of inﬂuence of the dielectric sensor
will have an effect on its performance. These properties vary with location and depth in a soil proﬁle
and it is important to take them into account when calibrating dielectric soil moisture sensors [55].
These sensors often rely on site-speciﬁc calibration, but they often come with ‘universal’ calibrations
which can be used where absolute accuracy is not required. The accuracy of calibration equations
supplied by manufacturers of these sensors are usually between a range of ±4 - 2% VMC when applied
in non-saline soils [56]. Site-speciﬁc calibration equations which are developed by comparing the
sensor output to gravimetrically derived soil moisture content can be applied when a higher level of
accuracy is required [57]. In addition, for capacitance type probes, it is essential that the probe access
tubes are ﬁtted correctly without air gaps to ensure robust soil water measurements. For a detailed
technical description of factors affecting the performance of dielectric sensors, readers are referred
to [58,59].
5.2. Proximal Sensing and Mapping of Soil Moisture
The recent advances in rapid mapping and positioning technologies enables the spatial
characterization of soil moisture retention properties to inform precision irrigation decisions.
The electromagnetic induction (EM) technique is used in combination with accurate positioning
systems to quantify soil moisture variability at resolutions less than 10 m. It also provides a highly
accurate digital elevation map (DEM) [2].
The EM sensor maps the soil’s apparent EC which is inﬂuenced by soil texture and moisture in
non-saline soils [48]. Those same factors correlate highly to the soil’s water-holding capacity. Based on
the EC maps, a targeted soil sampling can be conducted at different parts of the ﬁeld. Topographic
features that are likely to inﬂuence ﬁeld-scale soil moisture dynamics are derived using the DEM [60].
The EC maps enable the grouping of discrete units known as management units with similar
available water-holding capacity (AWC) characteristics which can then be used in selecting soil
moisture monitoring sites. This has been demonstrated by [34,61]. The data from soil moisture sensors
located in the management units can also be used in generating dynamic application maps based
on a relationship between the soil moisture depletion and the mapped EC values. These application
maps serve as an input into the precision irrigation control system. Hedley and Yule [21] applied soil
moisture sensors and an EC map in generating dynamic water status maps for a 35.2 ha irrigated
maize ﬁeld. Daccache et al. [8] applied a similar method in producing dynamic soil moisture maps for
various ﬁelds.
The electric resistivity tomography technique can also be applied in deriving the EC map of a ﬁeld.
Hedley et al. [2] reported that the method has a good vertical resolution but it cannot be deployed on a
moving platform for rapid non-invasive mapping. It has been applied by Kelly et al. [62] in positioning
soil moisture sensors to support irrigation decisions.
The ground-penetrating radar (GPR) can also be applied in monitoring the ﬁeld-scale soil moisture
status [50]. It can be mounted on a vehicle or moving irrigation system for mapping soil moisture in a
ﬁeld. The GPR is however affected by high clay content, is not amenable to automation and requires
further development to improve its viability in precision irrigation applications [63].
The deployment of soil moisture sensors in management units defined by these mapping techniques
enables the dynamic updates of soil moisture maps which can aid variable rate water application.
5.3. Weather-Based Sensing
Weather-based sensing involves the use of climatic variables in determining ET which is indicative
of the crops’ daily water use. Evaporation accounts for the direct evaporation of water to the air from
the soil surface or canopy interception of either precipitation or applied irrigation. Transpiration
Sustainability 2017, 9, 353
8 of 29
accounts for the uptake of water by a plant and the subsequent loss of water as vapor through stomata
in its leaves, required for metabolic cooling of the leaf to maintain photosynthesis without the leaf
overheating [41]. Evapotranspiration is generally viewed as a combination of the evaporation of water
from the soil, evaporation from the canopy surface and plant transpiration [64].
The evaporation and transpiration process occur simultaneously and are often difﬁcult to
distinguish. The predominance of each of these processes however varies at different crop growth
stages. At the initial crop growth stage, water is lost mainly in form of evaporation from the soil
surface. As the development of the crop progresses, transpiration becomes the major medium of water
loss to the atmosphere [45].
The ET process is largely dependent on solar radiation, vapor pressure deﬁcit of the atmosphere
at any given time and wind speed. It is also inﬂuenced by soil water content, the rate at which water
can be taken up from the soil by the plant roots and crop characteristics (type, variety and growth
stage) [64]. Readers are directed to [41,65] for a further discussion on the ET process.
The temporal dynamics of evapotranspiration on hourly or daily timescales is appropriate
for quantifying crop water use in the precision irrigation process. The United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organization Penman–Monteith (FAO-PM) equation presents a procedure for computing
hourly or daily ET values using standard climatological measurements of solar radiation, air
temperature, humidity and wind speed made at a height of 2 m above a fully transpiring grass
surface [41]. These data can be obtained from automatic weather stations installed on a speciﬁc ﬁeld or
from a metrological network. The equation provides a basis from which reference ET (ET from the
well-watered grass surface) for different time periods can be calculated and to which ET from other
crops can be computed using crop coefﬁcients, Kc [66]. The crop coefﬁcients are speciﬁc to each crop
and crop canopy cover, which is dependent on the crop growth stage. The Kc curve deﬁned for a crop
over its growth stage is generalized for regions with similar climates. The Kc is however dependent on
the canopy dynamics including cover fraction, leaf area index and greenness which may vary across
regions with similar climates [67]. This introduces errors into ET estimates derived using the standard
FAO-PM crop coefﬁcient approach. The FAO-PM method presents a relatively easy procedure for
determining the temporal dynamics of crop water use. The crop coefﬁcient used in determining the
actual ET of a particular crop however needs to be estimated at each growth stage. It is noted in
Allen et al. [41] that reference ET can be overestimated by as much as 20% during conditions of low
evaporative demand.
Remote sensing provides a means of overcoming the shortcomings of the FAO-PM crop coefﬁcient
approach of estimating crop ET by providing real-time feedback on daily crop water use as inﬂuenced
by actual crop canopy dynamics, local climatic conditions and ﬁeld spatial variability [68]. The remotely
sensed normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) computed from crop canopy reﬂectance
measurements in the red and near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths has been found to be a useful tool in
computing accurate crop coefﬁcients for a broad range of crops [69]. Singh et al. [70] has demonstrated
the use of the calculated reference ET and the remotely sensed NDVI in estimating the water use of
cotton. A similar procedure has also been demonstrated by Farg et al. [67] for estimating the daily
water use of wheat.
The surface renewal analysis method presents an opportunity for assessing the real-time temporal
dynamics of crop water use. The surface renewal (SR) method is used to determine the sensible heat
which can then be applied to the energy balance equation to determine the latent heat (i.e., ET) [71]. It is
based on analyzing the temperature time series generated from monitoring the change in heat content
of air parcels that interact with the crop canopy. When an air parcel comes in contact with the crop
canopy, the air temperature remains constant for a brief time period known as the quiescent period.
The temperature of the air parcel however increases after this time period as energy is transferred
to it from the crop canopy. The increase in temperature continues until the air parcel is replaced by
cooler air from the atmosphere. At this time, the temperature of the air shows a sharp drop [72].
A high frequency trace of this temperature renewal event exhibits a ramp-like function. Applying
Sustainability 2017, 9, 353
9 of 29
structure function theory to the ramp function enables the determination of the sensible heat ﬂux.
The instrumentation requirement for an SR system is minimal, consisting of small diameter ﬁne wire
thermocouples or a two-dimensional sonic anemometer and a high frequency data acquisition system
(2 Hz to 10 Hz) [71]. Standard climatological measurements are also required to obtain the other
parameters in the energy balance equation.
The SR technique requires that measurements are taken at a minimum height above the crop
canopy. It is assumed that the canopy is homogeneous and able to absorb all the momentum transferred
to it by the ambient airﬂow [73]. This assumption introduces errors in ET estimates over ﬁelds
with variable canopy structures. Castellvi and Snyder [74] concluded that the technique can be
applied for estimating ET from short and dense canopy crops as they are mostly decoupled from
the environment. The technique also requires calibration using an eddy covariance system or a
lysimeter. This may limit its practicality for farm-scale deployment. The SR methodology proposed by
Castellvi [75], however, does not require calibration. Rosa and Tanny [76], Shapland and Snyder [72],
and Rosa et al. [77] have reported highly accurate hourly ET estimates from various crops using a
surface renewal analysis system.
5.4. Plant-Based Sensing
The importance of plant-based monitoring becomes emphasized when studying the effect of
water deﬁcit on plants and its relation to plant water status. The temporal dynamics of crop water use
can be monitored using a number of plant-based methods. They include methods that require direct
contact with the plant and those that require only proximal contact with the plants [78]. The contact
sensors are useful in monitoring the temporal dynamics of the plant water status while the proximal
sensors are capable of assessing the spatial nature of crop water status across a ﬁeld and hence
well suited for the precision irrigation process [11]. A good understanding of the various aspects of
plant water status and plant drought physiology is important in the successful application of these
systems. Readers are directed to [79,80] for a comprehensive overview of plant-based sensing methods
applicable in irrigation management. Plant-based sensing systems measure either the plant water
content, plant water potential or the plant physiological response to moisture deﬁcits. A summary of
various plant-based sensing systems is given in Table 2. It should be noted that many of these require
skilled manpower and considerable management time for their operation.

5.5. Thermal Sensing
Plant canopy temperature is a widely accepted variable indicative of plant water status.
The stomata controls evaporative cooling of the leaves based on soil water status and prevailing
environmental conditions.
It closes due to increased water deﬁcits and a reduction in plant
transpiration causing an increase in plant canopy temperature [91]. The measurement of the crop
canopy temperature by infrared thermometry which is then normalized using an index such as the
crop water stress index (CWSI) can be used in determining the plant water status and its response to
water deﬁcits [79].
The CWSI is a well-established method of accounting for the variation in canopy temperature as
a function of prevailing microclimatological conditions and water deﬁcits [92]. It relates the difference
in the crop canopy temperature measured using infrared thermometry to the air temperature as a
function of atmospheric vapor deﬁcit [93]. This temperature difference is then related to an upper
and lower temperature baseline to determine a water stress index. The upper baseline represents
a non-transpiring crop and the lower baseline represents a fully transpiring crop under the same
prevailing environmental condition [30]. The CWSI is a dimensionless value of between 0 and 1, with a
value of 0 indicating a well-watered crop and a value of 1 indicating a severely water-stressed crop [93].
Biotic factors can also induce stress in a plant thus affecting transpiration rate, crop water use and
canopy temperature. These biotic factors also affect leaf colour and morphology which in turn affects
the optical properties of the crop canopy [94]. In order to successfully apply infrared thermometry as a
tool for assessing plant water status, it is important to differentiate between abiotic (such as water stress)
and biotic stresses (such as plant diseases and pest infestation). Multiband optical sensors could be
applied in detecting various crop diseases and crop infestation within a ﬁeld by computing vegetation
indices based on canopy reﬂectance measurements [33]. This has been applied by Garcia-Ruiz et al. [95]
for detecting citrus greening and by Yang et al. [96] for detecting infestation of green bugs and aphids
in wheat. It may be useful to outﬁt precision irrigation systems with these sensors.
The main advantage of thermal sensing for precision irrigation application is related to the
non-contact and real-time capability of the system. Infrared thermometry and thermography provide
the opportunity to map the spatial variation in crop water status which can guide in variable rate
irrigation management. The use of thermal sensing for guiding zone-speciﬁc water application has
been demonstrated as noted in Section 2.
A major problem faced in applying the thermal sensing approach is the establishment of the
baseline temperatures. In climates in which the air humidity is often high, variations in wind speed and
net radiation introduce signiﬁcant errors in the estimation of the lower limit baseline temperature [97].
A number of studies have been conducted to develop procedures for enhancing the possibility of
applying measurements of crop canopy temperature in inferring plant water status in humid regions.
Jones [98] provides an excellent summary of these research efforts. They include the use of well-watered
plots to substitute for empirical non-water stressed baselines, although these well-watered plots are
rarely available in practice. The use of artiﬁcial reference surfaces for measuring baseline temperatures
has been proposed but it is reported that these artiﬁcial reference surfaces differ signiﬁcantly in thermal
and radiative properties in comparison to real leaves. A modeling approach to simulating the canopy
resistance of well-watered plants has also been investigated but this is limited by the difﬁculties
encountered in correctly modeling stomata behavior and hence canopy resistance. The possibility
of including a wide range of metrological data including net radiation and vapor pressure deﬁcit in
deriving CWSI models for humid climates has also been investigated. The mathematical complexity
typical of the models however limit their practical application.
Another problem commonly encountered in applying infrared measurements of canopy
temperature in inferring plant water status is the inclusion of soil temperature and other background
temperature including the sky and stems in the measured canopy temperature. This usually leads to
errors in estimation of the canopy temperature as the soil and background temperature are usually
many degrees different from the canopy temperature [90]. Jones [99] proposed the use of narrow
Sustainability 2017, 9, 353
11 of 29
acceptance angle infrared sensors that can be positioned to view only single leaves as a solution to this
problem. It has however been found that the temperature estimates of single leaves determined
by this method is mostly not representative of the temperature of the plant canopy.
A dense
deployment of infrared sensors may seem an alternative but this may be prohibitive in terms of
cost for practical applications.
The advancements in the ﬁeld of thermal imagery and the recent availability of low-cost thermal
cameras has presented the possibility of overcoming the problems associated with the inclusion of
soil and background temperatures in the measured canopy temperature. Thermal imagery allows
for the average temperature of a deﬁned area to be obtained and also the separation of background
temperature from the area of interest. The temperature of a large number of individual leaves
making up a canopy can be included in an image while the soil and background temperature can be
discarded by applying automated image processing techniques [92]. Gonzalez-Dugo et al. [100] has
demonstrated the use of thermal imagery in mapping the crop water status in a commercial orchard
in Spain. They also demonstrated the rapid mapping of ﬁeld-scale crop water status by deploying
thermal imaging equipment on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).
Plant-based sensing methods including thermal sensing only provide information on the need for
irrigation and provide no information on the volume of irrigation application needed. They are used
in combination with soil-based sensing for this reason [19].
6. Decision Support
A decision support system for irrigation management and scheduling provides a framework
for incorporating various tools and techniques for site-speciﬁc irrigation decisions. The widespread
commercial adoption of precision irrigation will be predicated on the development of robust and
optimal decision support systems [19].
A number of decision support systems schedule irrigation at predeﬁned intervals and apply
predeﬁned irrigation volumes. They do not incorporate any form of sensor feedback on plant water
status, soil water status and climatic variables [101]. This ‘open-loop’ strategy is largely designed based
on heuristics and historical data. Mareels et al. [102] suggested that this is an inefﬁcient approach often
leading to overwatering and waste of fertilizer and other supplemental crop inputs.
Closed-loop irrigation strategies aim to irrigate: when the soil moisture content reaches a certain
threshold [103–105]; when plant sensors indicate a certain stress threshold [93,106,107] or with feedback
from crop simulation models with the aim of attaining a certain yield, crop physiological response or
economic objective [108]. These closed-loop irrigation strategies have been shown to improve water
use efﬁciency in the production of horticultural crops under protected environments. Environmental
conditions in such production systems can be controlled based on plant feedback which eliminates the
stochastic plant response often encountered in ﬁeld-scale crop production [109]. Belayneh et al. [110]
implemented a wireless sensor network of soil moisture sensors for closed-loop irrigation control in
a pot-in-pot nursery. A signiﬁcant reduction in water use was achieved by the system. The authors
also reported a 2.7-year payback period for the system. Chappell et al. [111] reported water savings of
83% for a closed-loop irrigation control system implemented in a protected crop production system.
They noted that there was less occurrence of plant diseases in the nursery due to the elimination of
over-watering. Saavoss et al. [112] reported a 65% increase in proﬁt due to the implementation of a
wireless sensor network-based closed-loop control system in a nursery. The authors noted that the
increase in proﬁt was due to improvement in crop quality and yield resulting from the precise control
of irrigation applications.
In ﬁeld-scale crop production, the crop needs vary over time and space due to both biotic and
abiotic factors [9]. McCarthy et al. [113] noted that in these crop production systems, closed-loop
strategies are unable to account for unknown crop dynamics, the stochastic nature of climatic variables
and crop response, and the time-varying nature of the soil-plant-atmosphere system. This last
point is especially due to crop growth, crop management and infestation of pests and diseases.
Sustainability 2017, 9, 353
12 of 29
The closed-loop systems are also unable to consider equipment and other operational limitations.
McCarthy et al. [114] concluded that an optimal decision support system must be ‘adaptive’ with
the ability of accommodating the temporal and spatial variability within the ﬁeld. The decision
support system must also have the capability of modifying irrigation decisions in response to crop
physiology, uncertainties in climatic inputs, soil, irrigation systems and water supply limitations,
economic considerations and the quality of sensor feedback.
6.1. Adaptive Decision Support
The characteristics of a cropping system varies over time. Within a cropped system, the properties
that will typically vary within and between seasons include crop growth, soil properties (due to
addition of nutrients and other management processes) and climate. This will have a direct inﬂuence
on the irrigation timing and volume required for optimal crop growth [11].
An adaptive decision support system is able to continuously re-adjust the irrigation scheduling
algorithm in order to retain the desired performance of the irrigation system [114]. The adaptive
decision support system is able to utilize historical or real-time sensor data to arrive at irrigation
timing and volume that adequately accounts for the temporal and spatial variability in the ﬁeld [114].
In control theory an adaptive control system is generally accepted as a control system able to adjust
its controller parameters based on sensor feedback from a process, such that the controlled process
behaves in a desirable way [11]. McCarthy et al. [108] noted that an adaptive decision support system
for irrigation may either be sensor-based if they use direct sensor measurements for the irrigation
strategy or model-based if they use a calibrated simulation model to aid irrigation decisions.
The development of adaptive decision support systems presents an opportunity to improve
sustainability in precision irrigation through improved water use and crop productivity. They will
also enhance synergistic applications of data available from soil, plant and weather sensors to arrive at
optimal irrigation scheduling decisions [108].
In this section we will present a brief discussion on state-of-the-art of adaptive decision support
systems. We will thereafter discuss the opportunities these systems present in improving sustainability
in irrigated agriculture. Readers are referred to [113] for a comprehensive overview on the application
of advanced process control to irrigation, details on methods of operation and a consideration of
fundamental control concepts as they apply to irrigation scheduling.
6.1.1. Mechanistic Models
A number of irrigation decision support systems are based on complex physical models which
closely resemble the actual physical system [115]. They are able to incorporate the physiological and
morphological representation of the plant into the decision support tool. Barnard and Bauerle [116]
described an irrigation scheduling system based on the spatially explicit biophysical model, MAESTRA
(Multi-Array Evaporation Stand Tree Radiation A), which couples the within-canopy photosynthesis
and stomatal conductance. Data on leaf temperature, canopy aerodynamics and environmental
variables are used as inputs into the model to predict the plant transpiration. They reported that
the model-based tool applied between 18% and 56% more water than a sensing-based method for
scheduling irrigation in four species. They, however, noted that the model-based approach produced
greater tree growth. Asher et al. [117] described a mechanistic model capable of inferring crop water
requirements. The model employs leaf temperature data as input for determining the crop aerodynamic
characteristics which is then used in the Penman–Monteith equation for calculating the actual crop
ET. A major drawback of these mechanistic models is that they include static parameters which, once
identiﬁed, are assumed to remain constant over the cropping season. This is rarely so in practice as the
cropping system varies over time due to both biotic and abiotic factors.

6.1.2. Simulations
Crop simulation models based on ﬁrst principle physical models of crop phenology, soil physics
and hydrology can be applied in simulating the crop response to irrigation and cropping system
management [115]. These simulation models provide the opportunity to evaluate the beneﬁt of several
precision irrigation strategies as they eliminate the need for time-consuming ﬁeld experiments [118].
They can be interfaced with real-time sensor feedback from soil or plant sensors and weather data to
determine daily irrigation requirements of crops. They can also be used in predicting the yield impact
of an irrigation strategy. This is achieved by employing weather forecast data in computing a daily soil
moisture balance and assessing the impact of soil moisture deﬁcits on crop growth [118].
DeJonge et al. [14] investigated the effect of variable rate irrigation management on corn
production in Iowa using the CERES-maize model. Corn yield was compared for a period of 28 years
under simulated scenarios of no irrigation, scheduled uniform irrigation and precision irrigation. They
reported no signiﬁcant difference in corn yield and water use between the uniform irrigation and
precision irrigation scenarios. Thorp et al. [24] described a methodology for applying the Decision
Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) crop growth model in analyzing variable rate
management practices including irrigation on crop growth and yield. The platform enabled the
evaluation of precision irrigation strategies on crop performance in predeﬁned management zones.
These systems are however incapable of real-time decision support and can only be applied using
historical data.
McCarthy et al. [114] proposed a simulation framework, VARIwise, capable of real-time decision
support in precision irrigation. The simulation framework is capable of incorporating real-time data
input from ﬁeld sensors in arriving at irrigation decisions. The combination of different sensor inputs
into the simulation framework enables adaptive decision support with the system being able to
re-adjust irrigation decisions based on plant feedback and also explore optimal control strategies.
Simulation models for use in irrigation decision support require extensive calibration and
validation to establish model accuracy. The limitation in data available for this endeavour often
limit the use of the platforms to speciﬁc crops.
6.1.3. Artiﬁcial Intelligence
Artiﬁcial intelligence presents the potential of solving problems in precision irrigation which
are complex, non-linear and ill-deﬁned [119]. Artiﬁcial intelligence algorithms are able to emulate
the human decision-making process when applied to a particular problem domain. They have been
deployed for implementing adaptive decision support in irrigation in form of artiﬁcial neural networks,
fuzzy logic and expert systems with mixed success to date [118–120].
Artiﬁcial Neural Networks
Artiﬁcial neural networks (ANN) are non-linear mapping structures employed in modeling when
the underlying data relationship is not well deﬁned. ANN are able to identify and learn correlations
between input data and corresponding target output values. They are able to predict the outcome of
new independent data sets making them a useful tool in predictive modeling [121]. ANN are well
suited for the irrigation decision support problem that can often be complex and stochastic in nature.
These networks are also adaptive in nature and are able to continuously learn in order to provide
optimal solutions to target problems in dynamic systems.
Karasekreter et al. [122] implemented an ANN for scheduling irrigation in a strawberry orchard
using soil moisture and its physical properties as model inputs. The system was able to achieve water
savings of 20.5% and an energy saving of 23.9%. ANN however require large datasets for training and
are unable to describe the physical dynamics of a system. This makes their use limited in real-time
decision support tools.
Sustainability 2017, 9, 353

Fuzzy Logic
Fuzzy logic is an artificial intelligence algorithm that can be used to model a process and relate it
to human experience in arriving at decisions. A fuzzy logic system is made up of a set used to classify
input data into membership classes, a decision rule that is applied to each set which culminates in a
human-like decision output from the system [123]. A detailed description of the process is given in [124].
Mousa and Abdullah [123] successfully applied a fuzzy logic model in scheduling irrigation in
drip and sprinkler irrigation systems using ET, soil moisture data and crop growth stage as model
inputs. Prakashgoud and Desai [124] employed a fuzzy logic system using soil moisture data, leaf
wetness and climatological data as model inputs in order to implement irrigation scheduling decisions.
The system was capable of maintaining soil moisture thresholds in the speciﬁed range. Giusti and
Marsili-Libelli [125] described an adaptive irrigation decision support system implemented with fuzzy
logic. The system incorporates a predictive model of the soil moisture and an inference system for
maintaining the soil moisture within an acceptable threshold. The system was reported to adapt
irrigation decisions to rainfall uncertainty and produced water savings of 13.55% over a simulation
period of 168 days.
The accuracy of fuzzy logic systems is largely tied to an in-depth knowledge of the system. They
also lack an inner mechanistic structure with the domain of applicability limited to the range of training
data used in setting them up. Delgoda et al. [115] suggested that the points mentioned makes decision
making with a fuzzy system an ad hoc process limiting its application in adaptive decision support.
Expert Systems
An expert system is a tool able to emulate the reasoning process a human expert would employ
in a decision-making process in his/her ﬁeld of expertise. It captures the human decision-making
expertise and heuristics representing it in a series of rules and facts [126]. An expert system typically
consists of a knowledge base component and an inference engine that acts as a reasoning tool [127].
Expert systems are especially suited to dynamic problems that are of a complex nature. They are also
well suited to dealing with incomplete and uncertain data [128]. This makes them well suited for
irrigation decision support which often requires the input of experts to arrive at optimal decisions.
Expert systems applied in irrigation decision support can be classiﬁed as either ‘expert systems
proper’ or hybrid expert systems. A detailed review on the application of expert systems in irrigation
decision support is given in [128,129]. The ‘expert systems proper’ class of irrigation decision support
tools schedule irrigation based on soil moisture and climatic data. They are unable to consider the
time-varying nature of the cropping system (crop growth, disease and pest infestation) to arrive at
optimal irrigation decisions. They are also unable to account for the stochastic nature of climatic
variables and are not well suited for real-time applications [129].
Hybrid expert systems which are also referred to as model-based expert systems combine
algorithmic techniques and a knowledge-based component in solving problems relevant to its
application domain. Its advantage in irrigation is that optimal irrigation decision can be made
by combining expert knowledge with data feedback from inﬁeld sensors, data-driven models and crop
simulation models [130]. Thomson and Ross [131] described a model-based expert system designed
for decision support in irrigation management. The system employs feedback from soil moisture
sensors to adjust the input of a crop simulation model, PNUTGRO (peanut crop growth simulation
model), and also incorporates the capability of sensor feedback validation. The system was reported
to maintain soil moisture at the deﬁned thresholds. Goumopoulos et al. [38] developed an expert
system-based adaptive decision support platform for zone-speciﬁc irrigation of strawberry plants.
The system includes a wireless sensor network of soil, climate and plant sensors providing feedback
for the decision support system. It also includes a machine learning process capable of inferring new
rules and extending the knowledge base from logged data sets. The system was reported to reduce
irrigation water consumption by around 20%. A hybrid expert system based on real-time soil moisture
data with the capability of incorporating plant models is described in Kohanbash et al. [132].

The performance of an expert system is largely dependent on the effectiveness of the knowledge
acquisition process. An error in this process will drastically affect the system reliability and its performance.
6.1.4. Learning Control
Learning control decision support strategies perform systems identiﬁcation using sensor feedback
without deﬁning a mathematical model [113]. Systems identiﬁcation models a dynamic system based
on a time series of measured input/output data [133]. A comprehensive overview on the theory of
systems identiﬁcation is presented in [134].
Iterative learning control can be applied in systems with ill-deﬁned models that operate
repetitively and assume the same initial condition after each iteration.
It is well suited to the
irrigation problem as irrigation scheduling and application is a repetitive problem over the crop
season. The time-varying nature of the soil–plant–atmosphere system can also be viewed as an
ill-deﬁned problem. The strategy is also able to improve system performance by eliminating the effects
of a repeating disturbance with undeﬁned dynamics. Applied to irrigation, this may be a measured
crop response that reoccurs as a consequence of irrigation. The temporal changes in crop water use
and weather conditions are not considered [113].
McCarthy et al. [114] noted that a drawback of the iterative learning approach may be the
inefﬁcient systems identiﬁcation resulting from the slow system dynamics of the crop system in
response to irrigation events. This results from the evaluation of the effect of only one irrigation
volume on plant response at any water application event. They suggested that this drawback may be
eliminated by applying the process of iterative hill climbing control. This learning control strategy
employs an adaptive varied identiﬁcation process. A range of irrigation volumes are applied at each
irrigation event to a number of test cells on the ﬁeld. The response in the test cell that best matches
the desired system performance is identiﬁed as the optimal irrigation process. They reported that
the iterative hill climbing control procedure was capable of maximizing cotton yield when used
with a combination of plant and soil sensors to provide feedback for the identiﬁcation procedure.
Their conclusions were however based on results from a simulation study and a ﬁeld-based validation
of the procedure was not reported.
The results of the learning control procedure are based solely on sensor measurements and may be
largely affected by sensor drift as a model of the crop response is not developed from the identiﬁcation
procedure. This method can be considered more of a “brute force” approach than a scientiﬁcally based
approach to scheduling irrigation.
6.1.5. Model Predictive Control
Model predictive control (MPC) is an industrial control approach employed in decision support
for large-scale multivariable problems with multiple constraints. It has been successfully implemented
in the food industry, petrochemical industry and power generation among others [135]. Model
predictive control employs a plant model and optimization algorithm to calculate plant inputs in order
to achieve a future value of a performance criterion. The system performance is predicted over a ﬁnite
horizon subject to constraints on both the inputs and outputs of the plant [101]. Readers are directed
to [135–137] for an in-depth review of the theory of model predictive control and its application in
various industries.
In the case of irrigation, applying a soil moisture balance model, the plant input will be the
irrigation amount, the plant output will be the soil moisture deﬁcit, and both crop ET and precipitation
values will be considered as disturbances as they cannot be controlled. A prediction of future input
values and disturbances is required in an MPC system in order to determine the optimal system
output [138]. This highlights the need for the incorporation of weather forecast data into the MPC
framework for irrigation decision support.
Model predictive control appears to be well suited to the domain of irrigation decision support.
The irrigation problem has input constraints in terms of optimal irrigation volume and output
Sustainability 2017, 9, 353
16 of 29
constraints in terms of soil moisture thresholds and the desired plant response to water deﬁcits [135].
Ooi et al. [139], Lozoya et al. [101] and Saleem et al. [135] described a model predictive control
framework for irrigation scheduling based on a soil moisture balance model. They employed a
system identiﬁcation procedure to generate a grey box model of the soil–plant–atmosphere system
with a network of soil moisture sensors providing real-time feedback to the control algorithm. They
all reported the ability of the MPC platform to sufﬁciently predict crop irrigation needs and also
observations of signiﬁcant water savings. The authors of the discussed systems however fail to account
for the stochastic nature of rainfall and crop water use in the system dynamics. Delgoda et al. [138]
noted that an adequate consideration of the uncertainty in rainfall and ET inputs into the water balance
model employed in the MPC framework will improve the capability of the MPC system.
Delgoda et al. [115] addressed the drawbacks noted in the above MPC frameworks by employing
disturbance afﬁne feedback control, an uncertainty modelling technique widely applied in MPC
to account for the stochastic nature of rainfall and crop water use. A simple order model of soil
moisture dynamics is included in the system to enable online calculation of model parameters, hence
accounting for the time-varying nature of soil-plant-atmosphere system. The authors reported an
optimal performance of the system in humid regions where considerable uncertainties in climatic
variables exist.
6.2. Commercial Sensor Applications in Adaptive Decision Support
Manufacturers of sensors and a number of system integrators are showing considerable interest
in developing innovative tools that will further optimize irrigation water use.
A sensor integration project is described by AgSmarts (Memphis, TN, USA). Moving irrigation
systems are equipped with sensors which provide data on crop growth stage and soil proﬁle. Aquaspy
soil moisture sensors (San Diego, CA, USA) positioned in various parts of the ﬁeld also provide data
on soil moisture status which is applied in irrigation timing and calculation of irrigation volumes.
These irrigation decisions are automatically adjusted based on the varying water requirements at each
crop growth stage [140].
Omica, Italy has deployed a wireless sensor network of Libelium environmental and soil moisture
sensors (Zaragoza, Spain) on a maize farm in Italy to support irrigation decisions. The sensors
are interfaced to a geo-referenced decision support system which enables zone-speciﬁc irrigation
management. The system is able to predict crop yield based on irrigation timing and application
volumes combined with historical yield data. This can then be applied in optimizing the decision
support system towards achieving a desired crop yield goal.
Most decision support systems presently produced for commercial use provide on/off irrigation
control based on speciﬁed thresholds and plant/crop sensor feedback. The incorporation of predictive
models into these systems will enhance the possibility of improving irrigation water use and crop
yield [141].
7. Opportunities for Improving Sustainability
Sustainability is premised on the principle of meeting the needs of the present generation without
compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Sustainable agriculture is
focused on developing farming practices that are safe and do not have an adverse impact on the
environment [142].
Pretty [143] suggested that sustainable agriculture integrates the main goals of environmental
health and economic proﬁtability. The efﬁcient and effective use of water is considered the main driver
for improving sustainability in irrigated agriculture. This will involve the use of less water for irrigating
crops and also preserving the quality of water sources. Conventional irrigation practices apply water
uniformly over a ﬁeld resulting in a high volume of water use. Overirrigation may also result from
this practice which causes leaching of nitrates and nutrients into ground water sources. An important
consideration would also be the use of less energy for operating water pumps and irrigation application
Sustainability 2017, 9, 353
17 of 29
equipment. Soil erosion continues to be a serious threat to sustainability in irrigated agriculture. This
can be eliminated by applying precise irrigation volumes to reduce surface runoff.
Precision irrigation presents a promising platform for improving sustainability in irrigated
agriculture. This is especially hinged on the possibility of eliminating the adverse environmental
impacts related to conventional irrigation practices with the adoption of precision irrigation.
The economic proﬁtability of the adoption of precision irrigation is however a very important point
to consider. This will be manifested in terms of improved crop yields and increased water savings
including the associated reduction in energy consumption resulting from the optimal matching of
irrigation inputs to the spatial water demands of the ﬁeld, thus reducing costs [11].
Precision irrigation is predicated on the hypothesis that the crop water requirements vary spatially
across a ﬁeld. In heterogeneous crops such as fruit orchards, this variability is also due to physiological
factors such as leaf area and fruit load [144]. It is assumed that varying water application across the ﬁeld
to meet this spatial crop water need will improve crop yield and reduce the costs of associated inputs.
Smith et al. [11] noted that the evidence to support this hypothesis in commercial crop production is
not readily found in literature.
Evans and King [18] reviewed much of the work prior to that date focused on analysing the
improvements in crop yield and water savings achievable with precision irrigation and suggested that
the greatest savings are likely to occur in humid climates by the increased utilization of stored moisture
and in-season precipitation. Results from simulation- and ﬁeld-based case studies they reviewed
showed water savings of 0% to 26% for well-watered crop production employing precision irrigation
strategies. No signiﬁcant improvements in crop yields resulting from the adoption of precision
irrigation were reported. They concluded that in arid and semi-arid regions, precision irrigation is
more suited to maximize net return rather than yield and it may have greater potential in reducing
irrigation water use in humid climates when irrigating to maximally utilize in-season precipitation.
They further noted that the economic beneﬁt of adopting precision irrigation for ﬁeld-scale crop
production is limited. This is because the cost of equipment, maintenance and management is much
greater than the revenue improvements achieved as a result of improved yield and water savings.
The payback period of implementing the technology may also exceed the useful life of the water
application equipment, typically placed at 15 years. A payback period ranging from 5 to 20 years is
noted in Smith et al. [11] for the adoption of precision irrigation for crop production in New Zealand.
Evans et al. [145] reviewed the adoption trends of spatially varied irrigation in the USA covering
a period of 20 years. They noted that about only 200 of the 175,000 moving irrigation systems in the
USA were ﬁtted with variable rate water application technology. They suggested higher net returns on
investment as a stimuli for adoption of precision irrigation by growers. Growers that had adopted the
technology reported no signiﬁcant savings in water and energy use in non-limiting water situations.
They noted that in more than 20 years of research pertaining to variable rate irrigation management,
the economic beneﬁt was yet to be demonstrated. This was attributed to the marginal water savings
(5%–15%) which is insufﬁcient to realize a payback for the initial investment in the water application
technology. They concluded that an economic strategy that optimizes net return rather than total
returns for the technology should be adopted as a long-term investment goal.
Heeren et al. [146] conducted a simulation study to assess the reductions in pumping costs
through the adoption of precision irrigation in 49,224 centre-pivot irrigated ﬁelds in Nebraska, USA.
The study focused on applying variable rate water applications in mining undepleted available water.
They noted that the reduction in pumping costs achieved from the adoption of precision irrigation
in all ﬁelds may be negligible in comparison to the cost of variable rate water application equipment.
They concluded that the adoption of this technology will be economically justiﬁable only with an
increase in energy costs.
An economic evaluation of spatially varied irrigation applications is presented in Lee [147].
The study assessed energy savings resulting from pumping lesser volumes of water for irrigation on
a 67-acre ﬁeld in Wyoming. The cost of installing the variable rate water application equipment on
Sustainability 2017, 9, 353
18 of 29
the ﬁeld was reported as $29,513 with a useful equipment life of 15 years. The yearly return for the
equipment based on energy savings achieved was computed as $1816.71, which equates to a payback
period of 16.25 years. This suggests that a payback will only be realized for the technology outside the
useful life of the equipment.
Precision irrigation offers the beneﬁt of providing water conservation beneﬁts by avoiding
overirrigation and the associated adverse environmental impacts [18]. Sadler et al. [148] discussed
water conservation strategies where precision irrigation can potentially reduce the total water applied
and improve the environmental quality of irrigated ﬁelds. They suggested that programing zero
irrigation amounts to non-cropped areas will improve water conservation using precision irrigation.
They also noted that adjusting spatial water application based on the inﬁltration rate of the soil and
soil water storage capacity will reduce the occurrence of surface runoff and soil erosion. Surface runoff
and leaching were identiﬁed as the major avenues for loss of nutrients from the soil. They suggested
the occurrence of this can be eliminated by spatial application of precise irrigation volumes based on
the soil water-holding characteristics. They presented several case studies in which the adoption of
precision irrigation has been demonstrated to enhance the environmental quality of irrigated ﬁelds.
They concluded that precision irrigation has the capability of improving water use efﬁciencies while
reducing the adverse environmental impacts associated with conventional irrigation practices.
The results from the above studies show that precision irrigation is a proven tool for improving
sustainability in irrigated agriculture in terms of enhancing environmental health. Its economic
justiﬁcation in terms of signiﬁcant yield improvements and water savings is however limited.
Evans and King [18] suggested that the lack of signiﬁcant improvements in yield response when
employing precision irrigation may result from the fact that the yield response to the water curve
near maximum yield (100% ET) is almost ﬂat, with small changes in water applied using precision
irrigation having little effect on yield. The majority of these precision irrigation studies have used only
soil data for irrigation management. The local microclimate and crop genetics may however have a
direct inﬂuence on the yield response of the crops.
Soil moisture status may also not provide a complete indication of crop water status, rather the
plant may be the best indicator of water availability. The decision support systems employed by
current precision irrigation systems assume that the soil–plant–atmosphere system never varies with
time. The characteristics of the crop, soil and climate vary within the season altering the timing and
optimal amount of irrigation volume required at any irrigation application event.
We argue that the incorporation of multiple sensed variables (plant, soil and weather data) will
enhance the possibility of arriving at optimal irrigation decisions and hence an improvement in
economic outcomes. This should be integrated with a decision support system that has the capability
to adapt to the time-varying nature of the cropping system. The decision support system should also
have the capacity to ‘learn’ in order to improve its performance based on experience and a target crop
production function. We discuss how this can be achieved by exploiting improvements in monitoring
and management considerations.
7.1. Monitoring Considerations
A precision irrigation system is designed to apply water at a differential rate in response to the
temporal and spatial variation in crop water need across a ﬁeld. This process is supported by a number
of sensors providing data to a real-time decision support system. These sensors include weather
stations, soil moisture sensors, environmental sensors, plant sensors and thermal sensors which may
be integrated into a wireless sensor network. A careful design of these sensing systems including a
consideration of factors affecting their performance is crucial in realizing the goal of improved water
use through precision irrigation.
Dielectric soil moisture sensors sense the water content of the immediate soil in their zone
of inﬂuence. The zone of inﬂuence reported for most commercial dielectric soil moisture sensors
corresponds to a cylindrical measurement volume of 1.5 L [149]. It is therefore important to install
Sustainability 2017, 9, 353
19 of 29
the sensors in areas representative of the soil moisture available for plant use. The normal practice
employed by most users is to place the sensors in the driest regions of the ﬁeld or in the regions
comprising of a soil proﬁle with the lowest available water-holding capacity [150]. Adopting this
approach will most likely lead to wetter regions in the ﬁeld receiving more frequent irrigation which
will consequently result in overirrigation. A more efﬁcient approach is to deﬁne irrigation management
zones and place a number of sensors in each management zone to give the average soil moisture
estimate. This may however be limited by cost.
A structured installation proﬁle is also necessary in order to capture soil water movement and
availability. It is recommended that sensors should be installed at each soil horizon along the plant
rooting zone [151]. An accepted convention is the installation of sensors at three to four depths along
the rooting zone (1 per 25% of total rooting depth). The sensor located on the uppermost soil proﬁle
is able to detect precipitation events, the sensor in the deepest part of the proﬁle is able to detect
drainage and the other sensors located midway in the soil proﬁle are able to capture soil moisture
dynamics useful in supporting irrigation scheduling decisions [152]. The variation in soil properties
at the different rooting depths should also be taken into account. With an increasing knowledge of
the site, it is usually possible to install the sensors at two depths and still adequately capture the soil
moisture dynamics. The soil moisture sensors should also be deployed using soil-speciﬁc calibration
equations to enable accurate estimates of soil moisture content.
The actual crop evapotranspiration can vary spatially and temporally under conditions of
unrestricted water supply. These variations can be the result of several factors including differences
in crop genetics, plant density, weed competition, pest intensity, nutrient availability and stage of
growth [18]. Addressing the variation in ET across a ﬁeld may result in signiﬁcant water savings.
The accurate measurement of evapotranspiration is crucial in arriving at optimal irrigation
decisions [71]. The FAO-PM procedure for calculating ET which is applied in many precision irrigation
systems relies on information from weather stations applied in calculating a reference ET which is
adjusted for speciﬁc crops using crop coefﬁcients. This calculated ET is assumed to be uniform for every
part of the ﬁeld. This will however result in the application of inaccurate irrigation volumes to replace
crop water use, owing to the spatial nature of the actual ET. The application of the NDVI technique
in determining site-speciﬁc crop coefﬁcients provides a platform for overcoming this challenge.
The surface renewal analysis procedure also presents a promising tool for quantifying the actual
crop ET. It is however best suited to homogeneous, short and dense canopies.
Plant-based measurements provide the best indication of plant water status as they provide a direct
measure of the plants’ response to soil moisture availability and climatic demand. An efficient plant-based
monitoring system should however respond sensitively to the slightest change in water deficits.
Measurements of leaf water potential and sap ﬂow are contact methods which give direct
information on plant water status but their spatial resolution is limited as many samples are required
to effectively monitor the dynamics of ﬁeld-scale plant water status [153]. Infrared thermometry has
provided a robust platform for assessing plant water status. The (CWSI calculated from the infrared
measurements of crop canopy temperature can adequately quantify ﬁeld-scale crop water status with
high spatial and temporal resolution. This presents a robust and cost-effective tool for use in precision
irrigation. Its application in humid regions is however marred with difﬁculties.
A systems engineering approach can be applied in overcoming the difficulties encountered with
applying the CWSI in humid climates. A mathematical model derived using this approach may adequately
simulate the real-time dynamics of the baseline temperatures required for computing the index.
A summary of the technology gaps and reﬁnements necessary in monitoring tools in order to
achieve robust precision irrigation management is presented in [11]. They include the limited volume
of inﬂuence, high cost and the need to improve the measurement accuracy of soil moisture sensors.
The reﬁnements recommended include the development of low cost soil measurement sensors with
a wider volume of inﬂuence, low cost and resilient wireless communication networks able to link
spatially deployed soil moisture sensors and the development of smart calibration software in order
Sustainability 2017, 9, 353
20 of 29
to improve the accuracy of soil moisture sensors. The technology gaps identiﬁed in plant sensing
technology include the limited knowledge of irrigation thresholds and quantity, and low spatial
resolution. The reﬁnements recommended include the integration of plant-based sensing with soil
moisture sensing tools in order to determine irrigation volumes, calibration of infra-red thermography
against physiologically explicit plant measurements in order to determine critical thresholds and the
deployment of IR thermography tools on low altitude UAVs to further enhance spatial coverage.
A combination of multiple sensor inputs deployed at a density that captures spatial variability
is therefore likely to yield the most robust and accurate solution for precision irrigation. This will
ensure that the decision support system is robust to data availability, gaps and deﬁciencies. This will
include data from soil, weather and plant sensors [11]. An important consideration will also include
developing cost-effective and user-friendly tools which will enhance the adoption of these adaptive
systems by farmers.
7.2. Management Considerations
Management can perhaps be viewed as the most vital aspect of a precision irrigation system.
Management acts as an interface between monitoring and decision support, culminating into irrigation
decisions. This enables the implementation of vital management decisions of when and where to
apply irrigation and also the irrigation volumes to be applied. The decision support system is perhaps
the management backbone of a precision irrigation system and its proper implementation is vital for
improving sustainability in irrigated agriculture.
The adaptive decision support tools discussed have the capability of improving crop yield and
water savings when deployed as part of a precision irrigation system. Smith et al. [11] noted that
the simulation of adaptive decision support strategies can be used in identifying optimal irrigation
scheduling decisions. A simulation tool capable of representing a range of ﬁeld conditions at different
spatial and temporal scales is considered ideal. Such a simulation framework is presented in [114].
Model-based decision support systems using feedback from multiple sensors may present a
platform for arriving at optimal water applications. MPC appears to be ideally suited for achieving the
aim of improving sustainability in irrigated agriculture. A decision support system based on MPC
employs an optimization algorithm to implement an input strategy with the best performance.
McCarthy et al. [113] noted that MPC implemented for a precision irrigation system could involve
the use of real-time data from ﬁeld sensors to calibrate a crop or soil model and then optimizing this
calibrated model to arrive at optimal irrigation scheduling decisions. A combination of data from soil
moisture sensors, thermal sensors and weather sensors would be appropriate for MPC. The data from
the sensors would most likely be required daily, as measurements are not required at a high temporal
resolution to calibrate the model. A dense deployment of these sensors is however required to account
for the spatial nature of ﬁeld-scale crop water use. The thermal sensors may be mounted on a moving
platform for spatial data collection across the ﬁeld.
Equipment availability, irrigation system capacity and other operational considerations can be
incorporated as system-level constraints in an MPC-based decision support system. These constraints
can be considered to arrive at future irrigation scheduling decisions [113].
MPC uses a model’s simulation to determine the optimum irrigation application timing and
volume. When combined with a soft sensing system, variables that are not directly measured can be
controlled and optimized. This presents a possibility of applying decision support systems based on
MPC in realising a desired crop yield and also a water-saving goal [136].
There has been considerable research into water use procedures that can achieve improved water
savings in irrigated agriculture, particularly deﬁcit irrigation. Deﬁcit irrigation (DI) is an irrigation
strategy in which a crop is exposed to a level of water stress at certain growth stages in its development
(regulated deﬁcit irrigation) or throughout its growth season. The growth stage in which the plant is
subjected to water stress is predetermined as a drought tolerant stage. The goal of deﬁcit irrigation is
that there will be little adverse effect on yield and irrigation water can be conserved [154]. Evans and
Sustainability 2017, 9, 353
21 of 29
King [18] suggested deﬁcit irrigation as a tool for improving water use in precision irrigation. They
noted that it can be applied in maximizing net returns and conserve large amounts of water in arid
and semi-arid regions.
It is however important to investigate the response of different crops to water deﬁcits including
timing tolerances in order to develop optimal deﬁcit irrigation strategies that can be integrated into
the precision irrigation decision support framework. It is also important to investigate the economics
of yield reduction associated with deﬁcit irrigation strategies. O’Shaughnessy et al. [33] suggested that
implementing deﬁcit irrigation as part of precision irrigation management will involve the continuous
assessment of crop stress and growth stage throughout the growing season. This will be instrumental in
avoiding temporary severe stress which could result in uneconomic reduction in crop yield or quality.
The high cost of the component technologies of precision irrigation including soil, plant and
weather sensors, decision support systems and variable rate water application systems is presently
a constraint to the wide-scale adoption of this technology by farmers [148]. The minimal yield
improvements and water savings currently achieved through ﬁeld-scale precision irrigation may
not justify the initial capital investment required for its adoption. As fresh water resources become
scarcer, it is expected that more premium will be placed on water abstracted for irrigated agriculture.
Regulatory agencies may also require farmers to continuously demonstrate the efﬁcient use of water.
These factors may promote the adoption of precision irrigation by farmers [155].
A conceptual model-based decision support system that uses the full range of plant, weather and
soil data for irrigation management is illustrated in Figure 1. This is currently being developed by the
authors. It involves the integration of various sensing systems, dynamic modeling, machine learning
and model predictive control into an adaptive decision support system for precision irrigation.

8. Conclusions
Technological innovations that can improve sustainability in irrigated agriculture form an
important vehicle for actualizing the optimal use of limited water resources. Precision irrigation
has been demonstrated as such an innovation, though presently the economic beneﬁt related to
the adoption of this technology at ﬁeld-scale crop production is minimal.
This is because the
potential for yield improvements and water savings may not cover the cost of technology required for
its implementation.
The application of adaptive control techniques to irrigation decision support and improvements
in monitoring tools has the capability of dealing with the time-varying and stochastic nature of the
soil–plant–atmosphere system while also considering operational limitations in arriving at optimal
irrigation decisions. This ultimately presents a platform for actualizing the environmental and
economic goals of sustainability in irrigated agriculture.
A robust design of monitoring tools including a proper combination of soil, weather and plant
sensors is however vital for the proper operation of an adaptive decision support system. The decision
support system should be able to account for the varying crop water requirements within season as a
result of both biotic and abiotic factors. The decision support system should also consider agronomic
objectives to ensure the optimal irrigation strategy is delivered by the precision irrigation system.
The high cost of sensors and the requirement for dense deployment in order to obtain data at
high spatial resolutions is presently a constraint. The large dataset required for the calibration of crop
simulation models is also another signiﬁcant problem. Future research needs include the development
of cost-effective soil moisture sensors with wider spheres of inﬂuence, identiﬁcation of irrigation
thresholds for plant-based sensors and the development of self-learning crop simulation models that
are able to infer relationships from a limited data set. The ﬁeld evaluation of adaptive decision support
systems would also be beneﬁcial in quantifying their sustainability improvement potential.

A systematic review of automated systems for real-time irrigation management

1. INTRODUCTION
The challenge of feeding a growing population with finite resources is becoming increasingly pressing. By 2050, the world population is expected to reach 9.7 billion, necessitating a 70% increase in food production (Falkenmark and Rockstrom, 2009). Irrigation plays a crucial role in enhancing crop yields and agricultural productivity to meet this growing demand. Studies have shown that irrigation can significantly increase crop water productivity, contributing to increased food production (Ali and Talukder, 2008; Playan and Mateos, 2005). However, water scarcity poses a significant challenge, with many regions facing water deficits and the need for improved water management practices (Falkenmark and Rockstrom, 2009). Optimizing irrigation schedules and doses based on crop requirements and environmental conditions is essential for maximizing yield and quality while minimizing water use (Zhang et al., 2024). The necessity of scalable water-efficient practices for increasing food demand cannot be overstated. Techniques such as regulated deficit irrigation, magnetically treated water, and the use of drought-tolerant crops like sorghum have shown promise in improving water productivity and ensuring food security (Mehmood et al., 2023; Putti et al., 2023; Hadebe et al., 2016). As the global food challenge intensifies, it is imperative to critically evaluate the current state and future potential of irrigation management systems to guide research, innovation, and implementation efforts towards fully autonomous, scalable solutions.

Despite the importance of irrigation in addressing the global food challenge, traditional irrigation management techniques, such as manual scheduling and timer-based systems, have significant limitations. These methods are often labor-intensive, inefficient, and less adaptable to changing conditions (Savin et al., 2023). Manual and timer-based scheduling can lead to high operational costs and inefficient water use (Raghavendra, Han, and Shin, 2023). The reliance on manual intervention and predetermined schedules limits their adaptability to changing environmental conditions, crop water requirements, and soil moisture levels (Kaptein et al., 2019). Sensor-based irrigation systems offer an alternative, enabling real-time adjustments based on soil water status measurements (Kaptein et al., 2019). However, the adoption of these systems in commercial settings has been limited, often requiring extensive input from researchers (Kim et al., 2014; Lea-Cox et al., 2018; Ristvey et al., 2018). The limitations of traditional irrigation management techniques highlight the need for scalable, automated solutions for greater efficiency in irrigation management. Automated systems that collect real-time data, analyze it, and make autonomous irrigation decisions can lead to improved water use efficiency and increased crop productivity (Champness et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2022). To fully understand the potential of automated systems, it is necessary to examine the automation of each part of the irrigation management pipeline and analyze the effectiveness and efficiency of integrated end-to-end solutions.

The emergence of smart irrigation management and IoT marks a significant shift from historical irrigation practices. Modern approaches rely on vast data and analysis algorithms, leveraging technologies such as remote sensing, sensor networks, weather data, and computational algorithms (Atanasov, 2023; Bellvert et al., 2023; Kumar et al., 2023). IoT plays a vital role in collecting vast amounts of data through sensors, data transmission, and tailored networks, enabling real-time monitoring and control of irrigation systems (Liakos, 2023; Zuckerman et al., 2024). These advancements in data collection and analysis have the potential to revolutionize irrigation management, allowing for more precise and efficient water use. However, challenges such as processing diverse data sources, data integration, and lack of integrated data analysis hamper the full benefit of IoT in irrigation management (Dave et al., 2023). The current fragmented approach in smart irrigation, focusing on individual components rather than the entire system, limits the potential for fully autonomous, real-time end-to-end irrigation management (Togneri et al., 2021). To address these challenges and fully realize the potential of smart irrigation management, there is a need for automating and integrating each section of the irrigation management pipeline, from sensor/weather data collection and transmission to processing, analysis, decision-making, and automated action (McKinion and Lemmon, 1985). This integration requires a thorough investigation of the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling seamless communication and compatibility between components within the automated irrigation management pipeline.

Machine learning (ML) plays a significant role in processing vast data, predicting plant stress, modeling climate effects, and optimizing irrigation in smart irrigation management systems. ML algorithms can analyze data collected from sensors and weather stations to determine optimal irrigation schedules (Vianny et al., 2022). However, the potential of ML is often constrained by manual steps, such as data interpretation, decision-making on irrigation timing and volume, and system adjustments. Automating ML integration to allow direct action from insights to irrigation execution, removing bottlenecks and achieving real-time adaptability, is crucial for fully autonomous irrigation management (Barzallo-Bertot et al., 2022). By integrating ML into automated systems, the irrigation management pipeline can become more seamless and efficient, enabling real-time decision-making and action based on data-driven insights. To achieve this level of automation and integration, it is essential to identify gaps and propose solutions for seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, aiming to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.

To achieve seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, interoperability and standardization are critical. Interoperability allows different system components, such as sensors, actuators, and software, to communicate and exchange data effectively, while standardization ensures that data is represented in a consistent format (Santos et al., 2020). Standardized protocols and data formats are essential for achieving seamless integration and ensuring compatibility between components in real-time irrigation management systems (Robles et al., 2022; Hatzivasilis et al., 2018). Existing and emerging standards, such as OGC SensorThings API and ISO 11783, have applicability to real-time irrigation management systems (Hazra et al., 2021). However, challenges such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security need to be addressed to fully realize the potential of interoperability and standardization in automated irrigation management systems (Hazra et al., 2021). Addressing these challenges is crucial for enabling the seamless integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline, which is essential for achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. A comprehensive evaluation of the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling the integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline is necessary to guide future research and implementation efforts.
The primary objective of this systematic review is to critically evaluate the current state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies for enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
Specific objectives include:
•	Examining the automation of each part of the irrigation management pipeline and the seamless integration of each section in the context of irrigation scheduling and management.
•	Analyzing the effectiveness and efficiency of integrated end-to-end automated irrigation systems.
•	Investigating the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling the integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline.
•	Identifying gaps and proposing solutions for seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, aiming to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.
By addressing these objectives, this systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive and critical evaluation of the current state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems. Its intention is to guide future research, innovation, and implementation efforts to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management that can contribute to addressing the global food challenge.

3. DATA COLLECTION TO CLOUD: AUTOMATION AND REAL-TIME PROCESSING
3.1. Irrigation management data
The success of automated irrigation management systems relies heavily on the collection, transmission, and analysis of various types of data. The most applicable data types for irrigation management include soil moisture, canopy temperature, weather data, and plant physiological parameters (Farooq et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Olivier et al., 2021; Evett et al., 2020). These data are typically collected from a range of sources, including in-field sensors, remote sensing platforms, weather stations, and manual measurements (Li et al., 2019; Karimi et al., 2018).
Soil moisture data is arguably the most critical type of data for irrigation management, as it directly reflects the water available to plants and can be used to determine the optimal timing and amount of irrigation (Olivier et al., 2021; Intrigliolo & Castel, 2006). Soil moisture sensors, such as tensiometers, capacitance probes, and time-domain reflectometry (TDR) sensors, can provide real-time measurements of soil water content at various depths (Farooq et al., 2019). These sensors can be deployed in a network configuration to capture spatial variability in soil moisture across a field (Karimi et al., 2018).
Canopy temperature data is another valuable type of data for irrigation management, as it can be used to assess plant water stress and adjust irrigation accordingly (Evett et al., 2020). Infrared thermometers and thermal cameras can be used to measure canopy temperature, which is influenced by factors such as air temperature, humidity, wind speed, and plant water status (Li et al., 2019). When plants experience water stress, they tend to close their stomata to reduce water loss, leading to an increase in canopy temperature (Evett et al., 2020). By monitoring canopy temperature and comparing it to reference values, automated irrigation systems can detect plant water stress and trigger irrigation events to maintain optimal plant health and productivity (Li et al., 2019).
Weather data, including temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, and solar radiation, are essential for predicting crop water requirements and scheduling irrigation events (Akilan & Baalamurugan, 2024). Weather stations equipped with various sensors can provide real-time measurements of these parameters, which can be used as inputs for crop water requirement models, such as the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith equation (Li et al., 2019). These models estimate crop evapotranspiration (ET) based on weather data and crop-specific coefficients, allowing for the calculation of irrigation requirements (Intrigliolo & Castel, 2006). By integrating weather data into automated irrigation systems, irrigation schedules can be dynamically adjusted based on changing environmental conditions, ensuring that crops receive the optimal amount of water at the right time (Akilan & Baalamurugan, 2024).
When collecting and utilizing these data types, several considerations must be taken into account, including the volume, frequency, format, and source of the data (Farooq et al., 2019). The volume of data generated by automated irrigation systems can be substantial, especially when high-resolution sensors are deployed at a large scale (Bastidas Pacheco et al., 2022). This necessitates the use of efficient data storage, processing, and transmission technologies to handle the data load (Farooq et al., 2019). The frequency of data collection is another important consideration, as it directly impacts the temporal resolution of the data and the ability to detect rapid changes in plant water status or environmental conditions (Bastidas Pacheco et al., 2022). Bastidas Pacheco et al. (2022) demonstrated that collecting full pulse resolution data from water meters provides more accurate estimates of event occurrence, timing, and features compared to aggregated temporal resolutions, highlighting the importance of selecting appropriate data collection frequencies to ensure the quality and usefulness of the data for irrigation management.
The format of the data is also crucial, as it determines the compatibility and interoperability of the data with various analysis tools and platforms (Farooq et al., 2019). Standardized data formats, such as JSON, XML, or CSV, can facilitate data exchange and integration between different components of the automated irrigation system (Zhang et al., 2023). The source of the data is another important consideration, as it can impact the reliability, accuracy, and spatial coverage of the data (Farooq et al., 2019). For example, in-field sensors provide highly localized measurements, while remote sensing platforms, such as satellites or drones, can provide data at larger spatial scales (Li et al., 2019). By combining data from multiple sources, automated irrigation systems can achieve a more comprehensive understanding of crop water requirements and optimize irrigation management accordingly (Farooq et al., 2019).
Data quality, accuracy, and reliability are paramount in irrigation management, as they directly impact the effectiveness of decision-making processes and the efficiency of water use (Gupta et al., 2020). Inaccurate or unreliable data can lead to suboptimal irrigation decisions, resulting in crop stress, yield losses, or wasted water resources (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022). Gupta et al. (2020) emphasized the critical importance of data security and privacy in smart farming systems, as the leakage of sensitive agricultural data can cause severe economic losses to farmers and compromise the integrity of the automated irrigation system. The authors also highlighted the need for robust authentication and secure communication protocols to prevent unauthorized access to smart farming systems and protect data in transit (Gupta et al., 2020).
Ramli and Jabbar (2022) addressed the challenges associated with implementing real-time, automated irrigation systems, including data quality, scalability, reliability, and security. They proposed solutions and best practices based on the analysis of case studies and real-world implementations, such as the use of redundant sensors, data validation techniques, and secure communication protocols (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022). The authors also emphasized the importance of regular maintenance and calibration of sensors to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the collected data (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022).
Researchers have investigated the use of data compression, aggregation, and filtering techniques to reduce bandwidth requirements and improve transmission efficiency in automated irrigation systems (Karim et al., 2023; Rady et al., 2020; Cui, 2023). Karim et al. (2023) explored the effectiveness of various data compression techniques, such as lossless and lossy compression algorithms, in reducing the size of data packets transmitted over wireless networks. The authors found that lossless compression techniques, such as Huffman coding and Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW), can significantly reduce data size without compromising data quality, while lossy compression techniques, such as JPEG and MP3, can further reduce data size by introducing acceptable levels of distortion (Karim et al., 2023).
Rady et al. (2020) developed a novel data compression algorithm specifically designed for irrigation data, which achieved significant compression ratios without compromising data quality. The authors demonstrated that their algorithm could reduce the amount of data transmitted over wireless networks, thereby improving the efficiency of the irrigation system and reducing costs (Rady et al., 2020). Cui (2023) investigated the use of data aggregation and filtering techniques to reduce the number of transmissions and save bandwidth in automated irrigation systems. The author proposed a data aggregation scheme that combines multiple sensor readings into a single value, such as the average soil moisture over a specified time interval, to reduce the frequency of data transmissions (Cui, 2023). Additionally, the author explored the use of data filtering techniques, such as Kalman filters and particle filters, to remove noise and outliers from sensor data, improving the accuracy and reliability of the transmitted information (Cui, 2023).
Data standardization and harmonization are crucial for facilitating seamless integration and interoperability between the various components of automated irrigation management systems (Zhang et al., 2023; Ermoliev et al., 2022). Zhang et al. (2023) developed a novel cyberinformatics technology called iCrop, which enables the in-season monitoring of crop-specific land cover across the contiguous United States. The authors highlighted the importance of data standardization and harmonization in the context of iCrop, as it allows for the efficient distribution of crop-specific land cover information based on the findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data principle (Zhang et al., 2023). By adopting standardized data formats and protocols, such as the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards, iCrop enables the seamless integration of various data sources and facilitates the interoperability of the system with other agricultural decision support tools (Zhang et al., 2023).
Ermoliev et al. (2022) proposed a linkage methodology for linking distributed sectoral/regional optimization models in a situation where private information is not available or cannot be shared by modeling teams. The authors emphasized the need for data standardization to enable decentralized cross-sectoral coordination and analysis, as it allows for the consistent representation and exchange of data between different models and stakeholders (Ermoliev et al., 2022). By adopting standardized data formats and interfaces, the proposed linkage methodology can facilitate the integration of various optimization models and support the development of comprehensive decision support systems for sustainable resource management (Ermoliev et al., 2022).
Metadata plays a vital role in providing context and enabling better data interpretation and decision-making in automated irrigation management systems (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021). Metadata refers to the additional information that describes the characteristics, quality, and context of the primary data, such as the sensor type, calibration parameters, measurement units, and timestamp (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021). Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al. (2021) highlighted the importance of metadata in water resources management, as it enables decision-makers to use the data to the best of its capabilities by understanding factors such as when water data was collected and what factors might have contributed to the measurements. The authors emphasized the need for standardized metadata formats and guidelines, such as the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) and the ISO 19115 standard, to ensure the consistency and interoperability of metadata across different water information systems (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021).
In the context of automated irrigation management systems, metadata can provide valuable information about the data collection process, sensor performance, and environmental conditions that can aid in data interpretation and decision-making (Cota & Mamede, 2023). For example, metadata about the sensor type and calibration parameters can help assess the accuracy and reliability of the collected data, while metadata about the weather conditions and soil properties can provide context for interpreting the data and adjusting irrigation strategies accordingly (Cota & Mamede, 2023). By incorporating metadata into the data management and analysis pipeline of automated irrigation systems, decision-makers can make more informed and context-aware decisions, leading to improved water use efficiency and crop productivity (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021).

3.2. Edge Computing and Fog Computing
Edge computing and fog computing have emerged as transformative technologies in the realm of real-time irrigation management systems, offering significant potential for improving efficiency, scalability, and reliability (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2019). Edge computing refers to the practice of processing data near the edge of the network, close to the source of the data, while fog computing is a decentralized computing infrastructure that extends cloud computing capabilities to the network edge (Hassija et al., 2019). These technologies bring computation and analytics closer to the data source, reducing the need for data to travel to the cloud and enabling faster processing and decision-making (Hassija et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020).
The potential of edge computing and fog computing in real-time irrigation management is immense. Abdel Nasser et al. (2020) proposed a two-layer system for water demand prediction using automated meters and machine learning techniques, demonstrating the potential of edge computing in improving the efficiency and scalability of irrigation management. The system collects and aggregates data from distributed smart meters in the first layer, while the second layer uses LSTM neural networks to predict water demand for different regions of households. By leveraging edge computing, the system can achieve high accuracy in predicting water demand, which is essential for efficient irrigation management (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020).
Tran et al. (2019) conducted a comprehensive review of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems, highlighting the role of fog computing in addressing data transmission challenges and enabling seamless integration across the irrigation management pipeline. The authors emphasize that real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems have the potential to significantly improve water efficiency, crop yields, and reduce labor costs. However, they also identify several challenges that need to be addressed, such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security, which can be effectively tackled by implementing fog computing architectures (Tran et al., 2019).
Edge computing offers several benefits in real-time irrigation management systems, including reduced latency, real-time decision-making, and reduced reliance on cloud connectivity (Mishra, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). By processing data closer to the source, edge computing enables faster response times and more efficient data handling (Mishra, 2020). Mishra (2020) highlights that edge computing reduces latency by processing data closer to the source, enabling real-time decision-making and lessening reliance on cloud connectivity by shifting processing to local or edge devices.
Zhang et al. (2020) explore the application of edge computing in agricultural settings, demonstrating its potential to improve the efficiency and accuracy of irrigation systems. The authors discuss how edge computing has prospects in various agricultural applications, such as pest identification, safety traceability of agricultural products, unmanned agricultural machinery, agricultural technology promotion, and intelligent management. They also emphasize that the emergence of edge computing models, such as fog computing, cloudlet, and mobile edge computing, has transformed the management and operation of farms (Zhang et al., 2020).
Fog computing plays a crucial role in distributing processing and storage across the network, enhancing the scalability and reliability of automated irrigation systems (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022; Singh et al., 2022). Premkumar and Sigappi (2022) evaluate the current state of automated irrigation management systems and propose a hybrid machine learning approach for predicting soil moisture and managing irrigation. Their study emphasizes the potential of fog computing in distributing processing and storage across the network, improving the efficiency and scalability of irrigation systems. The proposed hybrid machine learning approach outperforms other machine learning algorithms in predicting soil moisture, demonstrating the effectiveness of fog computing in enhancing the performance of automated irrigation systems (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022).
Singh et al. (2022) discuss the role of fog computing in distributing processing and storage across the network, enhancing scalability and reliability in agricultural management systems. The authors argue that by implementing fog computing, these systems can achieve faster data processing and response times, improving overall efficiency and effectiveness. They also highlight that fog computing can address the challenges faced by real-time data transmission in agricultural management systems, such as latency, bandwidth limitations, and data security (Singh et al., 2022).
The integration of edge and fog computing in real-time irrigation management systems is crucial for achieving fully automated, scalable, and reliable solutions. As the demand for autonomous irrigation management grows, these technologies will play a pivotal role in enabling faster decision-making, reduced latency, improved resource utilization, and seamless integration across the irrigation management pipeline (Tran et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020). By bringing computation and analytics closer to the data source and distributing processing and storage across the network, edge and fog computing can significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of automated irrigation systems, contributing to the overall goal of addressing the global food challenge through optimized water resource management and increased agricultural productivity (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022; Singh et al., 2022).

3.3. Automation of Data Collection
The automation of data collection is a critical component in the development of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies. It enables the efficient gathering of vital information about crop health, environmental conditions, and water requirements, which is essential for enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity. Two key aspects of automated data collection are the use of advanced sensing technologies for non-invasive plant stress detection and the implementation of wireless sensor networks and energy-efficient communication protocols for large-scale, long-term data collection.
Advanced sensing technologies, such as hyperspectral imaging and thermal sensing, have emerged as powerful tools for non-invasive plant stress detection in automated irrigation management systems. These technologies provide valuable information about crop traits, enabling early and accurate detection of plant health issues (Triantafyllou et al., 2019). Triantafyllou et al. (2019) propose a comprehensive reference architecture model that incorporates advanced sensing technologies in the sensor layer for real-time plant stress detection, highlighting their importance in providing non-invasive plant stress detection. Similarly, Hossain et al. (2023) present a novel IoT-ML-Blockchain integrated framework for smart agricultural management that leverages advanced sensing technologies to optimize water use and improve crop yield, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
Hyperspectral imaging can capture subtle changes in plant physiology that are indicative of stress, while machine learning algorithms can be employed to extract meaningful patterns from the spectral data and classify different stress types (Araus et al., 2014). Thermal sensing can detect changes in canopy temperature, which is influenced by factors such as plant water status (Li et al., 2019). By monitoring canopy temperature and comparing it to reference values, automated irrigation systems can detect plant water stress and trigger irrigation events to maintain optimal plant health and productivity (Li et al., 2019).
The integration of advanced sensing technologies in automated irrigation management systems has the potential to revolutionize precision agriculture. Jiang et al. (2019) demonstrate the effectiveness of a deep learning-based model in accurately detecting leaf spot diseases, highlighting the importance of image augmentation and deep learning algorithms in enhancing the model's performance.
Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and energy-efficient communication protocols have the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and reliability of data collection in large-scale, long-term irrigation systems. WSNs offer a cost-effective and scalable solution for real-time data collection in large-scale irrigation systems, providing remote monitoring and automated control capabilities (Mehdizadeh et al., 2020). Nishiura and Yamamoto (2021) propose a novel sensor network system that utilizes drones and wireless power transfer to autonomously collect environmental data from sensor nodes in vast agricultural fields, reducing operational costs and enhancing the efficiency of data collection. Similarly, Higashiura and Yamamoto (2021) introduce a network system that employs UAVs and LoRa communication to efficiently collect environmental data from sensor nodes distributed across large farmlands, optimizing data collection and reducing travel distance and time.
Energy-efficient communication protocols are crucial for ensuring reliable data transmission in challenging environmental conditions and extending the lifespan of sensor nodes (Mehdizadeh et al., 2020). Al-Ali et al. (2023) investigate the potential of WSNs and energy-efficient communication protocols for data collection in large-scale, long-term irrigation systems, discussing the challenges and opportunities of using these technologies to improve the efficiency and reliability of real-time data collection in irrigation management. Mehdizadeh et al. (2020) emphasize the need for careful consideration of factors such as data accuracy, energy consumption, and network reliability when designing effective WSNs for irrigation management, enabling timely irrigation decisions and improved crop yields.
The automation of data collection through the use of advanced sensing technologies and wireless sensor networks is essential for achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. By enabling non-invasive plant stress detection and large-scale, long-term data collection, these technologies contribute to the overall goal of optimizing water resource management and increasing agricultural productivity. The integration of these technologies in real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems has the potential to enhance agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity, ultimately contributing to the development of fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management solutions.

3.4: Real-Time Data Transmission Protocols and Technologies
Real-time data transmission is a critical component of automated irrigation management systems, as it enables the timely delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of suitable protocols and network architectures is essential for ensuring efficient and reliable data transmission in these systems, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
The Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol has emerged as a popular choice for real-time data transmission in IoT networks, including those used for automated irrigation management. MQTT is a lightweight, publish-subscribe protocol designed for constrained devices and low-bandwidth networks (Author, 2019). Its simplicity and low overhead make it well-suited for IoT applications where data transmission speed and energy efficiency are critical (Saranyadevi et al., 2022). MQTT provides three Quality of Service (QoS) levels, ensuring data reliability in real-time scenarios (Author, 2019). Chen et al. (2020) proposed novel algorithms to improve data exchange efficiency and handle rerouting in MQTT-based IoT networks for automated irrigation management systems. Their TBRouting algorithm efficiently finds the shortest paths for data transmission, while the Rerouting algorithm effectively handles the rerouting of topic-based session flows when a broker crashes. The combination of these algorithms can significantly improve the performance and reliability of automated irrigation management systems (Chen et al., 2020).
Client-server IoT networks, such as those based on MQTT, play a crucial role in real-time data transmission for automated irrigation management systems. In these networks, sensors and devices (clients) publish data to a central broker (server), which then distributes the data to subscribed clients (Verma et al., 2021). This architecture enables efficient data collection, processing, and dissemination, facilitating the integration of various components within the automated irrigation management pipeline. Verma et al. (2021) proposed an architecture for healthcare monitoring systems using IoT and communication protocols, which provides a comprehensive overview of existing approaches and highlights challenges and opportunities in the field. Although focused on healthcare, the insights from this study can be applied to automated irrigation management systems, emphasizing the importance of interoperability and standardization for seamless integration (Verma et al., 2021).
In addition to MQTT, other application layer protocols such as XMPP, CoAP, SOAP, and HTTP have been explored for real-time data transmission in IoT networks. Each protocol has its strengths and weaknesses, making them suitable for different applications and scenarios. XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) is an open-standard protocol that supports real-time messaging, presence, and request-response services (Saint-Andre, 2011). CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) is a specialized web transfer protocol designed for use with constrained nodes and networks in the Internet of Things (Shelby et al., 2014). SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services, while HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web (Fielding et al., 1999).
Motamedi and Villányi (2022) compared and evaluated wireless communication protocols for the implementation of smart irrigation systems in greenhouses, considering factors such as power consumption, range, reliability, and scalability. They found that ZigBee is the most suitable local communication protocol for greenhouse irrigation due to its large number of nodes and long range, while MQTT is the recommended messaging protocol for smart irrigation systems due to its TCP transport protocol and quality of service (QoS) options. GSM is a reliable and cost-effective global communication protocol for greenhouse irrigation, providing wide coverage and low cost (Motamedi & Villányi, 2022).
Syafarinda et al. (2018) investigated the use of the MQTT protocol in a precision agriculture system using a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). They found that MQTT is suitable for use in IoT applications due to its lightweight, simple, and low bandwidth requirements. The average data transmission speed using the MQTT protocol was approximately 1 second, demonstrating its effectiveness for real-time data transmission in precision agriculture systems (Syafarinda et al., 2018).
The choice of application layer protocol for real-time irrigation management depends on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. MQTT and RTPS (Real-Time Publish-Subscribe) are both suitable for real-time data transmission in IoT systems, but they have different strengths and weaknesses. MQTT is a better choice for applications that require low latency and high throughput, while RTPS is a better choice for applications that require high reliability and low latency (Sanchez-Iborra & Skarmeta, 2021). The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of various application layer protocols, provides valuable insights into the suitability of these technologies for real-time data transmission in automated irrigation management systems.
In summary, real-time data transmission protocols and technologies play a vital role in the automation of irrigation management systems, enabling the efficient and reliable delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of application layer protocols, highlights the importance of selecting suitable technologies based on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. By leveraging these technologies, automated irrigation management systems can achieve seamless integration and contribute to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.

3.5. Challenges and Solutions in Real-Time Data Transmission
Following the exploration of data collection, processing at the edge and fog, and automation in previous sections, we now turn to the critical aspect of real-time data transmission. While essential for automated irrigation management, this stage presents unique challenges that must be addressed to ensure system efficiency and reliability.
Obstacles in Real-Time Data Transmission
Agricultural environments present unique challenges for real-time data transmission, directly impacting the effectiveness of automated irrigation systems. Environmental factors can significantly disrupt wireless communication. Adverse weather conditions such as heavy rain, fog, and high winds can weaken or even block radio signals, leading to data loss and compromised system performance. Physical obstacles like trees, buildings, and uneven terrain further complicate signal propagation, creating reliability issues (Jukan et al., 2017; Yi & Ji, 2014; Zhang, Chang & Baoguo, 2018). These environmental challenges necessitate robust communication protocols and network architectures that can ensure consistent and reliable data flow.
In addition to environmental factors, technical limitations also present significant obstacles. Large-scale agricultural operations often demand long-distance data transmission, which can be hindered by the limited range of certain wireless communication protocols. Network congestion, occurring when multiple sensors transmit data concurrently, can lead to delays and potential data loss, further complicating real-time decision-making (Hameed et al., 2020). To mitigate these issues, researchers have investigated the potential of cognitive radio networks (CRNs) and dynamic spectrum access (DSA) for optimizing spectrum utilization and reducing interference (Righi et al., 2017; Shafi et al., 2018; Trigka & Dritsas, 2022). CRNs enable devices to intelligently sense and adapt to the surrounding radio environment, dynamically adjusting transmission parameters to avoid interference and improve communication efficiency. DSA, on the other hand, facilitates the dynamic allocation of unused spectrum, enhancing spectrum utilization and reducing congestion.
Furthermore, data security and privacy are paramount concerns in real-time irrigation systems. The sensitive nature of agricultural data, such as crop yields and farm management practices, necessitates robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches (Gupta et al., 2020). Implementing secure communication protocols, authentication mechanisms, and encryption techniques is essential to protect data integrity and ensure the trustworthiness of the system.
Investigating Data Optimization Techniques
To enhance the efficiency and reliability of real-time data transmission in automated irrigation systems, researchers have explored a range of data optimization techniques. Data compression techniques aim to reduce the size of data packets transmitted over the network, minimizing bandwidth requirements and improving transmission speed (Rady et al., 2020; Karim et al., 2023). Lossless compression algorithms, such as Huffman coding and LZW, preserve data integrity while effectively reducing data size, ensuring that no information is lost during transmission (Cui, 2023). Lossy compression algorithms, such as JPEG and MP3, offer higher compression ratios but introduce a controlled level of data loss, which may be acceptable for certain applications where some loss of precision is tolerable (Karim et al., 2023). The choice between lossless and lossy compression depends on the specific application and the trade-off between data size and accuracy.
Data aggregation techniques provide another effective approach to optimize data transmission. By aggregating multiple sensor readings into a single representative value, such as average soil moisture or temperature, the number of transmissions can be significantly reduced, conserving bandwidth and energy resources (Cui, 2023). This is particularly beneficial in large-scale irrigation systems where numerous sensors are deployed across vast areas, generating substantial amounts of data. Additionally, data filtering techniques play a crucial role in improving data quality and reliability. Kalman filters and particle filters can effectively remove noise and outliers from sensor data, ensuring that only accurate and relevant information is transmitted and used for decision-making (Cui, 2023). This is essential for preventing erroneous data from influencing irrigation decisions and potentially leading to suboptimal water management.
Sensor calibration, drift correction, and fault detection are essential for maintaining data accuracy and reliability (Dos Santos et al., 2023). Regular calibration ensures that sensors provide accurate measurements over time, while drift correction techniques account for gradual changes in sensor readings due to environmental factors or aging. Fault detection mechanisms can identify and address sensor malfunctions or anomalies, preventing erroneous data from influencing irrigation decisions and potentially harming crops or wasting water.
Addressing the Challenges
Effectively addressing the challenges in real-time data transmission requires a multifaceted approach that encompasses environmental, technical, and data-related considerations. Implementing robust and adaptive communication protocols is crucial for overcoming interference and signal degradation caused by weather conditions and physical obstacles. Selecting appropriate protocols, such as LoRa or ZigBee, with suitable range and penetration capabilities can ensure reliable data transmission in challenging agricultural environments (Motamedi & Villányi, 2022). Additionally, employing techniques like frequency hopping and error correction codes can further improve communication resilience and mitigate data loss.
Optimizing network architecture is another key consideration. Deploying a distributed network architecture with edge and fog computing capabilities can significantly enhance data processing and transmission efficiency (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2019). Edge devices can perform initial data processing and aggregation tasks, reducing the amount of data transmitted to the cloud and minimizing latency, while fog nodes can provide additional processing power and storage closer to the data source, enhancing scalability and reliability. This distributed approach alleviates the burden on the central cloud server and allows for more responsive and efficient irrigation management.
Data optimization techniques play a vital role in reducing bandwidth requirements and improving transmission efficiency. The choice of data compression, aggregation, and filtering techniques should be tailored to the specific requirements of the irrigation system, considering factors such as data type, accuracy needs, and available bandwidth. By carefully selecting and implementing these techniques, the overall performance and effectiveness of real-time irrigation systems can be significantly enhanced, leading to more sustainable water management practices and improved agricultural productivity.
By addressing these challenges and implementing appropriate solutions, real-time data transmission can become a reliable and efficient component of automated irrigation systems, contributing to the overall goal of achieving sustainable and productive agriculture in the face of growing food demands and water scarcity.

3.6. IoT Network Architectures and Variable Rate Irrigation (VRI) for Real-Time Irrigation
Real-time irrigation management systems heavily rely on the efficient and reliable transmission of data from sensors and weather stations to the cloud for processing and decision-making. However, agricultural environments present unique challenges to wireless communication, including adverse weather conditions, physical obstacles, and the limitations of wireless technologies. These challenges necessitate robust and adaptive solutions to ensure the consistent and timely flow of data, enabling truly autonomous irrigation scheduling.
Environmental factors, such as heavy rain, fog, and strong winds, can significantly disrupt wireless communication by attenuating or even blocking radio signals, leading to data loss and compromised system performance (Ed-daoudi et al., 2023; Jukan et al., 2017; Yi & Ji, 2014; Zhang, Chang & Baoguo, 2018). Dense vegetation, buildings, and uneven terrain create further complications by causing multipath propagation and shadowing effects (Yim et al., 2018; Gautam and Pagay, 2020). The study by Yim et al. (2018) on LoRa networks in a tree farm environment exemplifies these challenges, revealing reduced communication range and data reliability compared to theoretical expectations. This underscores the need for carefully selecting and optimizing communication protocols and network parameters to ensure reliable data transmission in such environments.
The study by Guzinski et al. (2014a) using a modified TSEB model further highlights the importance of high-resolution data in accurately capturing the spatial and temporal dynamics of energy fluxes influenced by environmental factors. This emphasizes the need for advanced data acquisition and processing techniques that can effectively represent the complexities of agricultural settings.
The limitations of traditional wireless communication technologies, such as limited range and network congestion, pose additional challenges for large-scale agricultural operations. Long-distance data transmission can be hindered by range limitations, while network congestion arising from numerous sensors transmitting concurrently can lead to delays and data loss, hindering real-time decision-making (Hameed et al., 2020). Addressing these challenges requires the exploration of advanced networking technologies that can optimize spectrum utilization, mitigate interference, and improve reliability and efficiency.
Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) and Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) offer promising solutions for optimizing wireless communication in agricultural settings. CRNs empower devices with the ability to intelligently sense and adapt to the surrounding radio environment, dynamically adjusting transmission parameters to avoid interference and improve communication efficiency (Righi et al., 2017; Shafi et al., 2018; Trigka & Dritsas, 2022). Research has explored the potential of CRNs in predicting Radio Frequency (RF) power to avoid noisy channels and optimize spectrum utilization (Iliya et al., 2014; Iliya et al., 2014). These studies demonstrate the effectiveness of combining optimization algorithms with artificial neural networks (ANNs) to enhance the accuracy and generalization of RF power prediction, enabling CRNs to make informed decisions about channel selection and avoid interference.
DSA complements CRN technology by dynamically allocating unused spectrum, further enhancing spectrum utilization and reducing congestion (Shi et al., 2023). The numerical model developed by Shi et al. (2023) showcases the potential of CRNs and DSA for optimizing wireless communication in challenging environments.
The integration of CRNs and DSA into the IoT network architecture requires careful consideration of spectrum sensing techniques, network topology, and data security. Research on cooperative spectrum sensing suggests that distributed approaches, where sensor nodes collaborate and share information, can significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of spectrum sensing, particularly in dynamic environments (Trigka and Dritsas, 2022; Khalid & Yu, 2019). This collaborative approach enables a more comprehensive understanding of the radio environment and facilitates the identification of available frequency bands for data transmission.
The choice of network topology also impacts the performance and scalability of CRN-based irrigation systems. Mesh networks, where sensor nodes are interconnected and relay data for each other, offer enhanced resilience and coverage compared to star topologies where nodes communicate directly with a central gateway (Akyildiz & Vuran, 2010). However, mesh networks can be more complex to manage and may introduce additional routing overhead. The trade-off between network resilience and complexity needs to be carefully evaluated to select the most appropriate topology for a specific agricultural setting.
Data security and privacy are paramount concerns in IoT-based irrigation systems due to the sensitive nature of agricultural data (Gupta et al., 2020). Implementing secure communication protocols, authentication mechanisms, and encryption techniques is essential for protecting data integrity and ensuring system trustworthiness. Research on secure spectrum leasing and resource allocation algorithms for CR-WSN-based irrigation systems has demonstrated the potential of these technologies for enhancing security and efficiency (Hassan, 2023; Afghah et al., 2018).
In conclusion, the development of effective and reliable real-time irrigation management systems requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the challenges of data transmission in agricultural environments. The integration of robust and adaptive communication protocols, optimized network architectures, and advanced networking technologies like CRNs and DSA, along with a focus on data security and privacy, can contribute significantly to achieving the goal of autonomous and efficient irrigation scheduling.
4. AUTOMATED DATA PROCESSING IN THE CLOUD
4.1. Data Quality and Preprocessing
Data quality is paramount in automated irrigation systems as it directly influences the effectiveness of decision-making and water use efficiency. Issues like missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers arising from sensor malfunctions, environmental interference, or network problems (Lv et al., 2023) can significantly impact the performance of machine learning models used for irrigation scheduling and management.
Real-time data cleaning techniques are essential for addressing these challenges. Kalman filtering proves particularly effective in handling missing values and correcting erroneous readings by recursively estimating the system's state based on previous measurements and current sensor data, taking into account noise and uncertainty (Kim et al., 2020). Moving average techniques, by averaging consecutive data points, provide a more stable representation of the underlying trend, filtering out short-term fluctuations (Chhetri, 2023). For outlier detection, adaptive thresholding methods offer a dynamic approach, adjusting thresholds based on the statistical properties of the data to effectively identify anomalies and minimize false positives (Bah et al., 2021). These techniques are crucial in maintaining the integrity of real-time data streams and ensuring the accuracy of subsequent analyses.
Adaptive data preprocessing is essential for managing the diversity of data sources and formats commonly found in irrigation systems. Data normalization techniques, such as min-max scaling or z-score normalization, ensure that all features contribute equally to the analysis by transforming data values to a common scale (Pradal et al., 2016). This is crucial for preventing features with larger values from dominating the analysis and ensuring that all features are given equal consideration. Similarly, feature scaling methods, like standardization or normalization, optimize the range of feature values to improve the performance and convergence of machine learning models (Tortorici et al., 2024). By scaling features to a similar range, the influence of outliers is reduced, and the model's ability to learn from the data is enhanced.
Data fusion techniques play a critical role in integrating information from diverse sources, creating a more comprehensive and reliable dataset for irrigation management. Dempster-Shafer theory, a generalization of probability theory, allows for the expression of both uncertainty and the degree of conflict in evidence, making it suitable for fusing uncertain and conflicting data from heterogeneous sources (Sadiq and Rodriguez, 2004). This is particularly relevant in irrigation systems where data from different sensors may provide slightly different or even contradictory information due to sensor variations or environmental factors. Bayesian inference offers another powerful framework for combining information from multiple sources, updating the probability of a hypothesis as new evidence becomes available. By applying these techniques, data from soil moisture sensors, canopy temperature sensors, weather stations, and other sources can be integrated to provide a holistic understanding of crop water requirements and environmental conditions, leading to more informed and accurate irrigation decisions.
The impact of data quality extends beyond model accuracy to the robustness of machine learning models under varying conditions. Robust models should maintain consistent performance even when faced with data inconsistencies or unexpected situations. Techniques like data augmentation and domain adaptation can enhance model robustness by exposing the model to a wider range of data variations during training. Data augmentation involves generating additional training data by applying transformations or introducing noise to existing data, making the model more resilient to noise and variations in the real-world data. Domain adaptation techniques aim to adapt a model trained on one domain (e.g., a specific crop or geographic location) to perform well on another domain with different data characteristics. This is particularly relevant in irrigation management, where models may need to be applied to different crops, soil types, or climatic conditions.
The choice of data cleaning, preprocessing, and fusion techniques should be carefully considered based on the specific characteristics of the irrigation system and the available data. By selecting and implementing appropriate techniques, the accuracy, reliability, and robustness of machine learning models can be significantly improved, leading to more efficient and sustainable irrigation management practices.
4.2. Scalable and Autonomous Deployment using Containerization Strategies
The transition from data collection and transmission to efficient data processing requires a robust infrastructure capable of handling diverse workloads and data volumes. Containerization technologies, specifically Docker and Kubernetes, offer a promising solution for deploying and scaling data processing and machine learning modules within cloud environments like AWS, Azure, and GCP (Vargas-Rojas et al., 2024; Rosendo et al., 2022; Solayman & Qasha, 2023). Docker provides a standardized way to package applications and their dependencies into self-contained units known as containers, ensuring consistent and reproducible execution across different platforms (Rosendo et al., 2022). Kubernetes, acting as a container orchestrator, manages their deployment, scaling, and networking across a cluster of machines (Rosendo et al., 2022). This combination presents several advantages for automated irrigation management systems.
Firstly, containerization facilitates efficient resource utilization and scalability. By encapsulating applications and their dependencies, containers enable the isolation of resources and prevent conflicts between different modules (Vargas-Rojas et al., 2024; Solayman & Qasha, 2023). This isolation allows for the efficient allocation of resources, such as CPU, memory, and storage, to each container based on its specific needs. Kubernetes further enhances scalability by allowing for the automatic scaling of containers based on real-time demand, ensuring the system can adapt to varying workloads and data volumes, preventing bottlenecks, and ensuring responsiveness to changing conditions (Karamolegkos et al., 2023).
Secondly, containerization promotes portability and reproducibility. By packaging applications and their dependencies into a single unit, containers make it easy to move and deploy them across different cloud environments without the need for environment-specific configurations (Rosendo et al., 2022; Solayman & Qasha, 2023). This portability simplifies the development and deployment process, reducing the time and effort required to set up and manage the system. Additionally, containers ensure reproducibility by providing a consistent execution environment, regardless of the underlying infrastructure. This eliminates variability and ensures that the system will behave consistently across different deployments (Zhou et al., 2023).
Optimizing container orchestration and resource allocation is crucial to minimizing latency and maximizing throughput in real-time data processing pipelines. Techniques like auto-scaling and dynamic resource allocation play a critical role in this context (Hethcoat et al., 2024; Werner and Tai, 2023; Kumar et al., 2024). Auto-scaling automatically adjusts the number of container instances based on real-time demand, ensuring that sufficient resources are available to handle peak workloads while avoiding over-provisioning during periods of low demand (Hethcoat et al., 2024; Kumar et al., 2024). Dynamic resource allocation enables the fine-grained adjustment of resources allocated to each container based on its specific needs and the current workload (Werner and Tai, 2023). This ensures efficient resource allocation and provides each container with the necessary resources to perform its tasks effectively.
Performance monitoring tools, such as Kubernetes Metrics Server and Prometheus, are essential for gaining insights into the performance of containers and the overall system (Hethcoat et al., 2024; Kuity & Peddoju, 2023). These tools provide valuable data on key performance indicators, such as CPU and memory usage, network traffic, and application-specific metrics. By monitoring this data, administrators can identify bottlenecks, optimize resource allocation strategies, and continuously improve system performance (Hethcoat et al., 2024). This data-driven approach ensures that automated irrigation management systems can operate efficiently and reliably.
By integrating containerization technologies with optimization techniques and performance monitoring, automated irrigation management systems achieve the scalability, autonomy, and efficiency required for effective real-time data processing and decision-making. This approach facilitates a seamless and responsive system that can adapt to changing conditions and contribute to the overall goal of optimizing water resource management and increasing agricultural productivity.

4.3. Deploying ML Models for Data Processing
Transitioning from data collection, preprocessing, and transmission, the deployment of machine learning (ML) models marks a pivotal stage in the automated irrigation management pipeline. This stage entails utilizing cloud platforms to facilitate real-time data processing and inference, enabling data-driven decision-making for optimal irrigation management and ultimately contributing to fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.
Several architectures and frameworks exist for deploying ML models on cloud platforms, each offering unique advantages and catering to different requirements. TensorFlow Serving, for instance, provides a high-performance system specifically designed for serving TensorFlow models (Abadi et al., 2016). This framework enables efficient and scalable inference, making it suitable for real-time applications where low latency and high throughput are crucial. For instance, in a large-scale irrigation system with numerous sensors generating data continuously, TensorFlow Serving can efficiently handle the high volume of inference requests and provide timely predictions for irrigation scheduling. Similarly, Apache MXNet Model Server offers a flexible and efficient solution for deploying models trained with MXNet, supporting a wide range of deep learning models and inference backends (MXNet Developers, 2015). This versatility makes it suitable for complex irrigation systems that may utilize different types of ML models for various tasks, such as predicting crop water requirements, detecting plant stress, or forecasting weather conditions. ONNX Runtime, on the other hand, provides a cross-platform inference engine compatible with various ML frameworks, including PyTorch, TensorFlow, and MXNet (Microsoft, 2017). This versatility enables the deployment of models in diverse environments, facilitating interoperability and reducing the need for model conversion. For example, an irrigation system that uses models trained in different frameworks can utilize ONNX Runtime to deploy them on a single platform without the need for time-consuming and error-prone model conversion processes.
Choosing the appropriate architecture or framework depends on several factors, including the specific ML framework used for model training, the desired level of performance and scalability, and the need for cross-platform compatibility. For instance, if the primary concern is low latency and high throughput for real-time inference, TensorFlow Serving might be the optimal choice for TensorFlow models. However, if flexibility and support for various deep learning models are required, Apache MXNet Model Server could be more suitable. In cases where cross-platform compatibility is essential, ONNX Runtime offers a versatile solution.
Once the ML model is deployed, optimizing its performance and resource utilization becomes crucial for ensuring the efficiency of integrated end-to-end automated irrigation systems. Model compression techniques, such as pruning and quantization, offer effective methods for reducing the size and computational requirements of ML models without compromising accuracy (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). Pruning involves eliminating unnecessary connections or neurons from the model, effectively streamlining its structure and reducing computational complexity. This can be particularly beneficial for deep learning models, which often have a large number of parameters and can be prone to overfitting. By removing redundant or less important connections, pruning can improve modelgeneralizability and reduce inference time. Quantization, on the other hand, involves reducing the precision of model parameters, typically from 32-bit floating-point numbers to lower-precision formats such as 8-bit integers. This reduction in precision leads to smaller model sizes and faster inference speeds, making it particularly beneficial for resource-constrained environments or real-time applications. For instance, in edge computing scenarios where ML models are deployed on devices with limited computational resources, quantization can enable efficient inference without sacrificing accuracy.
Furthermore, hardware acceleration through the utilization of GPUs or TPUs can significantly enhance model performance by leveraging specialized hardware designed for parallel processing (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). GPUs, with their massive parallelism and high memory bandwidth, excel at accelerating matrix operations and convolutions, which are fundamental computations in many deep learning models. This acceleration can significantly reduce inference time and enable real-time processing of sensor data for timely irrigation decisions. TPUs, specifically designed for deep learning workloads, offer even greater performance and energy efficiency for specific model architectures. These hardware accelerators can drastically reduce inference time, enabling near real-time decision-making and enhancing the responsiveness of automated irrigation systems. For example, in a scenario where immediate response to changing weather conditions or soil moisture levels is critical, hardware acceleration can ensure that irrigation decisions are made and executed promptly.
In addition to model compression and hardware acceleration, distributed training techniques play a crucial role in optimizing the training process for large-scale ML models. Techniques such as Horovod and BytePS enable the distribution of training across multiple machines, effectively parallelizing the process and reducing training time (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). This is particularly beneficial for complex models with a large number of parameters or when dealing with large datasets. By leveraging distributed training, irrigation management systems can train more sophisticated models and improve their predictive capabilities, leading to more accurate and efficient irrigation decisions. For instance, a system that utilizes a deep learning model with millions of parameters can benefit from distributed training to reduce training time from days to hours, enabling faster model iteration and improvement.
Integrating the deployed ML models with other components of the automated irrigation management pipeline is essential for achieving a fully autonomous and cohesive system and addressing the need for seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system. Standardized protocols, such as MQTT and CoAP, provide lightweight and efficient communication channels for exchanging data between these components (Poojara et al., 2023; Jimenez et al., 2020a; Gour et al., 2023). MQTT, with its publish-subscribe architecture, enables real-time data streaming and event-driven communication, making it suitable for transmitting sensor data, control signals, and inference results (Raikar & M, 2023). This enables the ML model to receive real-time updates on soil moisture, weather conditions, and plant health, allowing for dynamic adjustments to irrigation schedules based on the latest data. CoAP, designed for constrained devices and low-power networks, offers a web-transfer protocol for resource-constrained environments, enabling efficient communication between sensors, actuators, and the ML models (Raikar & M, 2023). This is particularly relevant in situations where sensors or actuators have limited processing power or battery life, as CoAP minimizes communication overhead and energy consumption. Additionally, RESTful APIs provide a standardized interface for accessing and controlling the ML models, enabling seamless integration with other software components and facilitating system management and monitoring (Wang et al., 2022). This allows for easy integration with existing farm management systems or third-party applications, creating a unified platform for comprehensive irrigation management.4.4. Online Learning in the Cloud
The complexities of real-time data processing in irrigation management necessitate the exploration of advanced techniques to continuously learn and adapt to the dynamic nature of agricultural environments. Online learning algorithms offer a promising solution, enabling the continuous update and improvement of machine learning models based on incoming real-time data. This adaptability is crucial for addressing the challenges of changing environmental conditions, such as weather patterns and crop growth stages, and optimizing irrigation decision-making to enhance water usage efficiency and crop productivity.
Several online learning algorithms have demonstrated potential for real-time data processing and model adaptation in the context of irrigation management. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) facilitates the incremental update of model parameters with each new data point, allowing for efficient adaptation to changing data distributions (Bottou, 2010). This incremental learning process ensures that the model remains responsive to the latest conditions, minimizing the risk of outdated predictions and improving the accuracy of irrigation decisions. Passive-Aggressive algorithms, on the other hand, adjust model parameters only when a misclassification occurs, providing a computationally efficient approach for handling large data streams (Crammer et al., 2006). These algorithms offer a robust approach to handling noisy data, a common challenge in real-world sensor readings, by making small adjustments only when the model's prediction deviates significantly from the actual value (Fei et al., 2019). Online Random Forests extend the concept of random forests to the online setting, enabling the incremental construction and update of decision trees as new data arrives (Saffari et al., 2009). The continuous evolution of the ensemble ensures that the model remains relevant to the changing environment, capturing intricate relationships between variables and leading to more informed irrigation decisions.
Research in various domains highlights the importance of online learning for real-time data stream analytics. Snyder et al. (2020) explored the application of online learning techniques for identifying relevant tweets in real-time, improving situational awareness for first responders. The proposed interactive learning framework allows users to continuously label the relevance of incoming tweets, enabling the real-time refinement of the underlying machine learning model. This user-guided approach aligns well with the dynamic nature of irrigation management, where models need to continuously adjust to varying environmental conditions and crop water requirements. Similarly, research in the field of cyber-physical systems (CPS) underscores the need for online learning algorithms to effectively extract insights and knowledge from continuously generated data streams (Fei et al., 2019). These capabilities are crucial for enabling feedback loops between physical processes and cyber elements, facilitating the integration and optimization of CPS in irrigation management systems.
To implement online learning in cloud-based irrigation management systems, various architectures and frameworks can be considered. Apache Spark Streaming, Apache Flink, and AWS Kinesis provide scalable and fault-tolerant platforms for processing real-time data streams, allowing for the development of online learning pipelines that continuously ingest and analyze data to update machine learning models (Zaharia et al., 2012; Carbone et al., 2015; Amazon Web Services, 2023). These frameworks leverage serverless computing paradigms, automatically scaling resources based on the volume and velocity of incoming data, ensuring efficient resource utilization and responsiveness to fluctuations in demand (Fei et al., 2019).
Effectively managing the exploration-exploitation trade-off is crucial for optimizing online learning in irrigation management. Techniques such as Multi-armed bandits (Sutton & Barto, 2018), Bayesian optimization (Shahriari et al., 2016), and Reinforcement Learning (RL) (Sutton & Barto, 2018) can be employed to balance the allocation of resources between exploring new irrigation strategies and exploiting the current best-performing approaches. These techniques enable the identification of optimal irrigation policies, adapting to changing environmental conditions and maximizing long-term rewards.
In conclusion, online learning techniques, coupled with scalable cloud-based architectures, offer a powerful solution for real-time data processing and continuous adaptation in irrigation management systems. By leveraging algorithms like SGD, Passive-Aggressive, and Online Random Forests, along with stream processing frameworks like Apache Spark Streaming, Apache Flink, and AWS Kinesis, irrigation management systems can effectively handle the complexities of real-time data, optimize water usage, and enhance crop productivity in the face of dynamic environmental conditions.

5. GENERATING AND APPLYING IRRIGATION INSIGHTS 
5.1. Real-Time Generation of Actionable Irrigation Insights
The transition from data collection and processing to actionable irrigation insights requires the extracting spatial features from images, allowing for the analysis of satellite or drone imagery to assess crop health, detect water stress, and provide insights into irrigation needs (Os deployment of advanced predictive models capable of generating precise and site-specific irrigation recommendations.roosh et al., 2016).
Furthermore, the integration Deep learning models, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and of data from diverse sources, including IoT sensors and cloud-based platforms, plays Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), have demonstrated excellent performance in capturing complex relationships a critical role in enhancing the accuracy and resolution of real-time irrigation insights. Data fusion techniques, such as Kalman filtering, offer a robust approach for combining information between input variables and predicting crop water requirements (Keller, 2023; Naphade et al., 2022). These models can effectively from multiple sensors, accounting for noise and uncertainty, and providing a more comprehensive understanding of crop water requirements (Cohen et al., 2005; Mö handle the temporal dependencies present in time-series data, such as soil moisture andeller et al., 2007). By integrating data from soil moisture weather data, and learn to predict future water needs based on historical patterns and current sensors, weather stations, and remote sensing platforms, ML models can generate more accurate conditions. Ensemble methods, such as Random Forests, also offer a robust approach to and site-specific irrigation recommendations, leading to improved water use efficiency and crop productivity prediction by combining multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce the risk of overfitting.
The heterogeneity, uncertainty, and quality issues inherent in real-time data streams require careful consideration and the implementation of effective strategies to ensure the reliability of generated (Singh et al., 2016).
The integration of irrigation insights. Data preprocessing techniques, such as outlier detection and missing value imputation, IoT sensor data with cloud-based data sources is crucial for enhancing the accuracy and resolution of irrigation insights. IoT sensors, such as soil moisture probes and weather stations are essential for preparing the data for analysis and preventing erroneous data from influencing the model, provide real-time, localized data on crop and environmental conditions, while cloud's predictions (Fiksel, 2003). Additionally,-based sources, such as weather forecasts and satellite imagery, offer broader spatial and the selection of appropriate ML models and data fusion techniques should be tailored to the specific temporal perspectives (López-Morales et al., 2020). characteristics of the irrigation system and the available data to mitigate uncertainty and ensure the robustness Data fusion techniques, such as Kalman filtering, play a critical role in combining these of generated insights.
To address computational complexity and latency challenges in real-time irrigation insight generation, techniques such as edge computing, model compression, and hardware accelerators heterogeneous data sources to generate more accurate and comprehensive irrigation recommendations (Cohen et al., offer promising solutions. Edge computing enables the distribution of processing tasks closer to the data 2005; Möeller et al., 2007 source, reducing latency and enabling faster response times (Mishra, 20). By incorporating data from multiple sources, irrigation models can better account for spatial variability20; Zhang et al., 2020). Model compression techniques, such as pruning and quantization, can significantly reduce the size and computational requirements of in soil moisture, microclimate conditions, and crop water requirements, leading to more ML models without compromising accuracy, making them suitable for deployment on resource-constrained edge precise and efficient irrigation scheduling.
The seamless integration of ML-generated insights with IoT-enabled irrigation control systems requires the adoption of appropriate architectures and protocols that facilitate devices (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). Hardware lightweight, real-time communication. The Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT accelerators, such as GPUs and TPUs, provide specialized hardware designed for parallel processing) protocol and the Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) are well-suited, enabling faster inference speeds and facilitating real-time data analysis (Premkumar for this purpose, offering efficient and reliable communication channels for exchanging data between sensors, & Sigappi, 2022). The combined utilization of these techniques can significantly improve the efficiency and responsiveness of real-time irrigation insight generation, contributing actuators, and ML models (Muangprathub et al., 2019; Osroosh et al., 2016). to the overall goal of achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.
The implementation MQTT's publish-subscribe architecture enables real-time data streaming and event- of these strategies and techniques for real-time generation of actionable irrigation insights provides a solid foundation for developing automated and data-driven irrigation management systems that can effectively addressdriven communication, while CoAP's lightweight design and low overhead make it suitable the global food challenge by optimizing water resource utilization and maximizing agricultural productivity.
for resource-constrained devices and low-bandwidth networks. By utilizing these protocols, irrigation systems can achieve seamless integration between ML models and IoT devices, enabling the automated application of irrigation insights based on real-time data and predictions.
Industry-leading products and services for smart irrigation demonstrate the practical application of these technologies. Smart irrigation controllers, such as Rachio, leverage weather data and soil moisture sensors to automatically adjust irrigation schedules based on real-time conditions, reducing water waste and promoting water conservation (Verdouw et al., 2023). Cloud-based irrigation management platforms, such as CropX, offer advanced analytics and decision support tools, providing farmers with insights into crop water requirements, soil health, and irrigation performance (Weikmann et al., 2023). These platforms often incorporate machine learning algorithms to generate predictive models and provide farmers with data-driven recommendations for optimizing irrigation strategies.
The analysis of these products and services highlights the growing trend toward data-driven, automated irrigation management. By integrating IoT, machine learning, and cloud computing, these solutions enable farmers to make more informed and efficient irrigation decisions, contributing to the overall goal of achieving sustainable and productive agriculture.

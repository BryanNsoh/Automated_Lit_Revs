Methods Here, we design and fabricate a novel FURS robot with a comprehensive force feedback function. Moreover, to realize better force feedback, a neural network-based method is also demonstrated to estimate the interactive forces between the flexible ureteroscope and the environment. Results We show that when teleoperating the flexible ureteroscope with our robot, the operator can accurately feel the obstruction if the interactive axial force or torque exceeds 1.2 N or 15.6 mN·m respectively. For bending movement, augmented force feedback greatly improves the accuracy of the operator's perception of obstruction. Conclusions The developed robotic system with force feedback is expected to improve the safety of robot-assisted FURS. 1 INTRODUCTION Flexible ureteroscopy (FURS) is an important natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) in urology. It can be performed to treat many upper urinary tract diseases, for example, urothelial tumours and kidney stones.1 Figure 1A shows the schematic of FURS: a flexible ureteroscope is inserted into the upper urinary through the natural urethra, bladder, and ureter for diagnosis and treatment. Patients suffer less pain and recover fast because no additional surgical incision exists. Hence, FURS is widely used in clinic.2 However, conventional FURS has its drawbacks. First, urologists are at risk of X-ray radiation exposure during the operation.3 Second, the urologist has to stand and manipulate the flexible ureteroscope for a long time when treating kidney stones, which increases the prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders among urologists.4 Third, besides the flexible ureteroscope, multiple surgical instruments need to be manipulated simultaneously such as the irrigation device for improving the endoscopic visibility and the laser fibre for smashing kidney stones, which makes the operation complicated. Moreover, high intrarenal pressure resulting from irrigation increases the risk of severe complications.5 FIGURE 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint (A) The schematic of FURS. (B) A commercial single-use flexible ureteroscope and three common manipulations in FURS: translate, rotate, and bend. FURS, flexible ureteroscope With the development of robotics, a large number of researches about surgical robots have emerged.6 They aim to improve conventional surgeries including FURS. Around 2008, Desai and colleagues developed a master-slave-controlled robot for FURS to protect urologists from X-ray radiation.7, 8 The urologist can teleoperate the flexible ureteroscope away from the radioactive source. However, this robot was altered from a cardiovascular surgical robot, making it fail to match FURS well. In 2011, the research group in Turkey proposed a novel robotic system (named Avicenna Roboflex) which was specially designed for FURS.9-11 This robot meets most of the requirements of FURS: it can manipulate the commercial flexible ureteroscopes and laser fibres, and is also equipped with an irrigation system.12 Later, Zhao and colleagues13 also developed a similar robotic system to improve the ergonomics of FURS. The above researches contribute a lot to the development of robot-assisted FURS. However, force feedback, an important feature of the master-slave controlled FURS robot, is rarely studied. Since the urologist no longer holds the flexible ureteroscope in robot-assisted FURS, the feeling of manipulating forces is absent. It will challenge the urologist's operation, surgical safety, and the instrument's efficacy as well. For example, the flexible ureteroscope may be stuck in the urinary system for various reasons.14-16 If the feeling of force doesn't exist, it will be hard for urologists to perceive this dangerous event. Moreover, withdrawing the bending flexible ureteroscope from the renal calyx without awareness may also lead to severe intraoperative complications.17 Additionally, exerting excessive torque on the bending knob may damage the flexible ureteroscopes.18 Therefore, force is closely related to surgical operation, and force feedback is very important for robot-assisted FURS. Recently, our previous work19 brought partial force feedback into the design of FURS robot. However, the research only considered the torque of the flexible ureteroscope's bending knob, which is not enough because multiple manipulating forces are generated and need to be displayed to the operator during the ureteroscope's three typical movements—translation, rotation, and bending (Figure 1B). Therefore, this paper aims to propose a novel robotic system with a more comprehensive force feedback function for FURS. Interactive forces that occur during the three movements of the flexible ureteroscope are all taken into consideration in this novel robot, including axial force while advancing and withdrawing the flexible ureteroscope, axial torque while rotating the flexible ureteroscope, and torque while rotating the flexible ureteroscope's bending knob. 2 MATERIALS AND METHODS Here, according to the requirements of FURS, we develop a novel robotic system with force feedback function for FURS. To achieve better force feedback, a neural network-based method is adopted to estimate the interactive forces between the flexible ureteroscope and the environment by identifying the intrinsic forces. These intrinsic forces are generated by overcoming the influence of machining and assembly variation, the gravitational moment of the robot itself, the intrinsic torque for bending the flexible ureteroscope's bending section, and so on. Subsequently, experiments are conducted to preliminarily evaluate the force feedback function of our robotic system. 2.1 Requirements of the robotic design 2.1.1 Manipulation of the flexible ureteroscope Manipulating the flexible ureteroscope (Figure 1B) is a fundamental function of FURS robot. The flexible ureteroscope is one of the most important instruments to perform FURS. As shown in Figure 1, the outer diameter of the flexible ureteroscope's slender shaft is less than 3 mm, and a working channel whose diameter is approximately 1 mm exists in the shaft. The working channel can be used for the entrance of other instruments, such as the laser fibre for lithotripsy. It can meanwhile be used for irrigation to maintain a clear vision. The distal end of the shaft is integrated with a camera and light source, and it can be actively bent up or down with the flexible ureteroscope's bending knob, to explore each calyx in the kidney. During the operation, the urologist needs to manipulate the flexible ureteroscope for forward and backward movement, axial rotation, and the knob's rotation (Figure 1B). Additionally, the flexible ureteroscope should be at an appropriate height relative to the patient. Consequently, the robot needs four actuators to manipulate the flexible ureteroscope, including: horizontal movement actuator for advancing and withdrawing the flexible ureteroscope; rotary movement actuator for rotating the flexible ureteroscope; bending movement actuator for rotating the flexible ureteroscope's knob; vertical movement actuator for adjusting the height. 2.1.2 Manipulation of other surgical instruments Apart from manipulating the flexible ureteroscope, some other functions are also required for most FURS. First, the robot should be able to feed the holmium laser fibre which will be gradually consumed during the intervention. Additionally, irrigation is important for obtaining a clear endoscopic view, and it would be better if the robot is equipped with an automatic and controllable irrigation system. Although commercial irrigation devices exist in the market, they usually work with a manual pump which is pumped by the urologist or assistant for supplemental irrigation.20 Hence, the robot's built-in irrigation system allows the urologist to easily control the irrigation and can reduce the number of staff in the operating room. 2.1.3 Sensing requirements The ability of sensing is important for realizing force feedback and improving safety. As stated in the introduction section, three interactive forces exist between the flexible ureteroscope and the environment during manipulation, including axial force, axial torque, and bending knob's torque. If the flexible ureteroscope is trapped in the urinary tract for unexpected reasons,14-16 the axial force and torque will help urologists to notice this dangerous event and avoid worse complications. The torque exerted on the flexible ureteroscope's bending knob is also important, which helps protect the flexible ureteroscope because excessive torque will damage it.18 Moreover, if bending movement is restricted, it will be reflected in the torque of rotating the knob and further protect the tissues. Additionally, sensing intrarenal pressure during the intervention is also helpful for supporting urologists' decisions to reduce the risk of complications.21 2.2 Design and prototypes of the robot To meet the above requirements, our robot is designed as shown in Figure 2. The flexible ureteroscope is mounted on the end-effector of the robot and manipulated by four actuators—vertical movement actuator, horizontal movement actuator, rotary movement actuator, and bending movement actuator. The front end of the robot's end-effector has a passive retractable mechanism to support the flexible shaft of the flexible ureteroscope. Moreover, to feed and withdraw the laser fibre, an instrument feeding actuator is also designed. The actuator consists of two friction wheels that are compressed by springs and can adapt to instruments with various outer diameters. Furthermore, an automatic irrigation module that can noninvasively estimate the intrarenal pressure22 is integrated into the top of the slave robot. FIGURE 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint The design of the proposed slave robot As for force sensing, some researchers have developed a miniature sensor based on fibre Bragg gratings and placed it on the tip of the flexible ureteroscope.23 Compared with common strain gauge-based force sensors, this fibre sensor can measure the interactive forces on the tip with higher accuracy. It also has good biocompatibility and can resist electromagnetic interference, which is advantageous in complex electromagnetic environments such as operating rooms. However, it occupies the flexible ureteroscope's working channel, making other surgical instruments like laser fibre inaccessible. Moreover, the miniature sensor can only sense the interactive force on the tip, and cannot measure the interactive forces exerted on the whole flexible shaft, where the flexible ureteroscope may be stuck. Hence, we here adopt three ordinary force/torque sensors at the joints of the robot to estimate the interactive forces. They are the axial force sensor (DYZ-101, Da Yang Sensing System Engineering Corporation), the axial torque sensor (DYJN-104D, Da Yang Sensing System Engineering Corporation), and the bending knob's torque sensor (DYJN-104D, Da Yang Sensing System Engineering Corporation), respectively. The locations of these sensors are shown in Figure 2, and they will not occupy the flexible ureteroscope's working channel. In Figure 2, represents the axial force of pushing or pulling the robot's end-effector and represents the axial torque of rotating the robot's end-effector, while represents the torque of rotating the flexible ureteroscope's bending knob. The interactive force/torque between the flexible ureteroscope and the environment will be transmitted to the sensors at the robot joints. They can sense the force/torque exerted on the whole flexible shaft of the flexible ureteroscope since the measuring position is behind. These sensors are based on common strain gauges, which are cost-effective. However, the compromise is that the accuracy is lower than that of the fibre sensor. For example, the error of the strain gauge-based axial force sensor is 0.05 N, while the fibre sensor is only 0.03 N.23 The prototypes of the robotic system are shown in Figure 3. The master console platform, which was introduced in our previous research,19 is composed of two haptic devices (Falcon, Force Dimension) whose coordinate systems are also shown in Figure 3. With our system, the urologist can control the flexible ureteroscope mounted on the slave robot by manipulating the two haptic devices. The mapping law of movements from the haptic devices to the slave robot is designed as FIGURE 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint The prototypes of the robotic system and the coordinate systems of the haptic devices The left of the equation is the joints' velocities of the slave robot (Figure 2), which control the flexible ureteroscope's translation ( ), rotation ( ), and bending movement ( ). The right is the haptic devices' velocities in cartesian space (Figure 3) multiplied by scale factors ( ). The movements not mentioned in the mapping law, such as the adjustment of the height, are controlled by buttons. Correspondingly, the mapping law of forces from the slave robot to the haptic devices is designed as The left is the reproduced forces of the haptic devices along the corresponding axis— (Figure 3), while the right is the forces and joint angles measured by the slave robot after being processed with feedback algorithms ( ). 2.3 Force feedback strategy Although the interactive forces between the flexible ureteroscope and the environment will be transmitted to the sensors at the robot joints, the problem is that other intrinsic forces will also be exerted on the sensors. These intrinsic forces include the driving torque to overcome the gravity and rotate the robot's end-effector, the force and torque for acceleration and deceleration, the friction of the mechanism, and so on. Consequently, even when the flexible ureteroscope is moving freely and no interactive force exists, the sensor readings will not be zeros. Figure 4A,B shows the readings of the axial force and axial torque sensors when the end-effector of the robot rotated back and forth in a certain range. During the rotation, a flexible ureteroscope (US31B-12; Innovex Group) was mounted on the robot and could move freely so that no interactive force existed during the movement. As shown in Figure 4A, the axial force sensor readings will change slightly when the end-effector rotates, due to the machining and assembling variation. As for axial torque (Figure 4B), it will change for overcoming the dynamic gravitational moment since the centroid of the end-effector is not located on the rotation axis. Other uncertain factors also affect the sensor readings, which makes them irregular and inconsistent. Figure 4C shows the readings of the torque sensor on the bending knob when it was actuated back and forth, and the maximum angle would also increase after every few rotations. As the figure shows, the torque will increase as the bending angle increases, because the distal bending section of the flexible ureteroscope is driven by the proximal knob with strings, and the friction and elasticity will increase as the bending angle increases. FIGURE 4 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint The sensor readings when the joints rotate back and forth under free movement. Readings of axial force sensor (A) and axial torque sensor (B) when rotating the flexible ureteroscope. Readings of bending knob's torque sensor (C) when rotating the bending knob To sum up, the intrinsic forces are correlated with the motion trajectory, such as rotation angle and direction, and there exhibits hysteresis. Eliminating or weakening the influence of these intrinsic forces is important to only display the real interactive forces to the urologist. Hence, we here propose a unified force feedback strategy (Figure 5)—robot self-learning to handle these intrinsic forces. More explicitly, we let the slave robot move randomly in a certain range without manual teleoperation and sample the joint states and joint force/torque sensor data simultaneously. Then these data are used to train neural networks to predict the above intrinsic forces. Once the intrinsic forces are identified, we can remove them from the joint sensor readings, then a cleaner interactive force can be displayed to the urologist. Since no external sensors and manual manipulation are needed to model the intrinsic forces, this method is called robot self-learning here. FIGURE 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint The schematic diagram of the augmented force feedback strategy. NN-based, neural-network-based 2.4 Estimate the intrinsic forces with robot self-learning To establish the model to identify the various intrinsic forces in real-time, a data-driven method based on neural network is adopted. We let the slave robot randomly manipulate the flexible ureteroscope with generated trajectories. During the manipulation, the flexible ureteroscope can move without any restriction (defined as 'free movement’). The middle of the flexible ureteroscope's flexible shaft is supported by a smooth table on the same horizontal plane, and the flexible shaft is so light that the friction can be ignored. Therefore, the interactive forces between the flexible ureteroscope and the environment can be regarded as zeros. Simultaneously, the angles of the robot joints and the readings of the robot force/torque sensors are sampled at a frequency of 20 Hz. Then, the sequence of angles is taken as neural networks' input and the corresponding sensor readings are taken as outputs (Figure 6). FIGURE 6 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint The schematic diagram of predicting the intrinsic forces based on two kinds of neural networks. GRU, gated recurrent unit; LSTM, long short-term memory For each force and torque, we tried two types of artificial neural networks which are multilayer perceptrons (MLP) and sequence models—long short-term memory (LSTM) and gated recurrent unit (GRU). To obtain data for training neural networks, the flexible ureteroscope was randomly manipulated by the slave robot without any restriction for 4 h. Two hours were for axial rotation and 2 h were for bending movement. These two movements are relatively independent, and axial rotation has little effect on the knob's torque sensor while bending movement also has little effect on the axial torque sensor. Therefore, when performing one movement, another movement remained stationary and at the home position. Moreover, considering that the translational acceleration of the flexible ureteroscope is small during actual operation, the axial inertial force has little impact on the sensor readings, which is about the order of 10−2 N. Hence, the translation movement was ignored here, and only the axial rotation and bending movement were considered. The random trajectories of the slave robot were generated by randomly choosing a pair of <target angle, speed> from the angle set and the speed set (Table 1) which take into account the typical range of the speed and angle during actual operation. Figure 7A,B shows part of the trajectory of generated random manipulation. To train and evaluate the neural networks, we separated the two datasets of axial rotation and bending movement into training set, development set, and test set according to the proportion of 60% (4320 s), 20% (1440 s), and 20% (1440 s), respectively. Then a deep learning framework, TensorFlow, was adopted to establish and train our neural networks. After several trials, the hyperparameters of the neural networks were set as shown in Table 2. Moreover, for obtaining subsequences from the long joint angle sequence, the size of the sliding window was set to 15, while the step was set to 1 (Figure 6). TABLE 1.

We will first evaluate the performance of the neural networks on the test set of generated random manipulation. However, it is not enough for neural networks to only perform well on the generated random manipulation. The key point of robot self-learning is that the neural networks trained under generated random manipulation can also work under manual master-slave manipulation, the actual application scenario of the robot. The joint trajectories of the slave robot under master-slave manipulation are shown in Figure 7C (rotation) and Figure 7D (bending). These trajectories have slight jitters and their peaks are less sharper compared with that under generated random manipulation (Figure 7A,B), which will change the distribution of data. Hence, to verify the transferability, we will further test the performance of the neural networks under manual master-slave manipulation. These neural networks are pretrained with the data of generated random manipulations. 2.5 Evaluate the force feedback function Once the intrinsic forces are estimated by the neural networks, the proposed force feedback strategy shown in Figure 5 is ready to function. In this section, we will design experiments to verify the performance of the force feedback function in our robotic system. 2.5.1 Axial force An experimental platform (Figure 8A,B) was designed to verify the axial force feedback. The platform allows the flexible shaft of the flexible ureteroscope to rotate and translate. Meanwhile, the actual interactive axial force exerted on the flexible shaft can be measured by the sensor on the platform. More specifically, the flexible shaft is fixed on the bearing inner ring by a locking ring, which allows it to rotate freely. The bearing outer ring is fixed on one end of the force sensor (DYLY-108, Da Yang Sensing System Engineering Corporation) on the platform. The other end of the force sensor is fixed on the slider which can translate on the linear guide. During the movement, an interactive axial force can be exerted on the flexible shaft by pushing and pulling the slider manually or by the limit blocks, which aims to simulate the axial force exerted on the flexible ureteroscope during the actual intervention. FIGURE 8 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint The experiment setup of evaluating axial force feedback (A, B) and axial torque feedback (C, D) To test the accuracy of the axial force feedback, we first conducted experiments to compare the interactive axial force estimated by the robot with the actual interactive force measured by the experimental platform. During this experiment, a participant manipulated the haptic device to rotate the flexible ureteroscope. Another participant pushed and pulled the slider to exert an interactive axial force on the flexible ureteroscope. To further verify the benefit of the axial force feedback, we next experimented to find out whether the operator could be aware that the flexible ureteroscope is stuck in the urinary system with the help of axial force feedback. The flexible ureteroscope's being stuck in the urinary system is a dangerous event that may cause severe complications. To simulate this event, the platform in Figure 8B was still used and a participant manipulated the haptic device to withdraw the flexible ureteroscope mounted on the slave robot. There is also the situation of being stuck when pushing forward the endoscope. However, since the endoscope is soft, the pushing force will be much smaller than the pulling force, which will make the situation less dangerous. Moreover, the pushing force and pulling force on the sensor are essentially equivalent and only in the opposite direction. Therefore, only withdrawing manipulation was performed. During the manipulation, the force feedback strategy in Figure 5 was applied (see Appendix A1 for details). The estimated interactive force was displayed to the operator via the haptic device. Meanwhile, the actual interactive force was also recorded by the experimental platform. Once the slider was blocked by the limit block, the flexible ureteroscope would be stuck, and the stuck force increased if the flexible ureteroscope was continuously being withdrawn. The operator needed to judge whether the flexible ureteroscope was stuck during the manipulation. Once the operator judged that the flexible ureteroscope was stuck, the final actual interactive force and feedback force were both recorded. The above experiment was repeated 10 times after the operator had tried twice. During each trial, the initial position of the slider is random, so the operator can not predict the stuck event by moving distance. Moreover, the experimental platform and the operator were separated and the operator could not see the distance between the slider and the limit block. Therefore, the operator could only rely on force feedback to make judgements, which ensured the validity of the experiments. 2.5.2 Axial torque In actual intervention, the interactive axial torque exerted on the flexible shaft of the flexible ureteroscope is quite small, only a few to tens of millinewton meters. Therefore, to reduce the influence of estimation error, we propose a continuously overstepping threshold method for the axial torque feedback (Appendix A2). Briefly, only when the estimated interactive torque is continuously greater than a preset threshold will it be displayed to the operator. Based on this feedback algorithm, we also experimented to find out whether the operator could become aware that the flexible ureteroscope is stuck during rotation movement. The experimental platform was designed as shown in Figure 8C,D. A torque sensor (DYJN-104, Da Yang Sensing System Engineering Corporation), for measuring the actual axial interactive torque, was fixed on the platform. In each experiment, the flexible shaft of the flexible ureteroscope might be fixed on the torque sensor, or not. An operator controlled the flexible ureteroscope to rotate axially (from zero degrees to approximately −55°) by manipulating the haptic device. Meanwhile, during the manipulation, the operator needed to judge whether the flexible ureteroscope was stuck, that is, fixed on the sensor. Once the operator became aware that the flexible ureteroscope was stuck, the manipulation would be terminated, and the actual interactive axial torque exerted on the flexible ureteroscope and the corresponding estimated value would be recorded. If the movement was close to −55° and was still not judged as a stuck state, the manipulation would also be terminated, and the operator's judgement would be marked as 'not stuck’. Like the axial force experiments, the operator could only rely on force feedback to make judgements. The above experiment was repeated 10 times after the operator had tried twice. 2.5.3 Bending force When the bending of the flexible ureteroscope's distal end is restricted by the tissues or laser fibres, the interactive force will be reflected in the driving torque of the bending knob. Compared with free bending, when the bending section is restricted, the torque profile of rotating the bending knob will change.19 However, since the bending section itself requires a large intrinsic torque to be bent, it's difficult for the operator to become aware of the anomaly from the large intrinsic torque. Fortunately, the proposed augmented force feedback strategy (Figure 5) can eliminate the intrinsic torque, which will enhance the operator's perception. To verify the effect of the augmented feedback strategy, two rounds of trials were conducted. In the first round, the neural networks were not used and the whole bending knob's torque was displayed to the operator after being multiplied by an appropriate gain. In the second round, the bending knob's torque would be subtracted by the intrinsic torque predicted by the neural networks before being displayed to the operator (Appendix A3). In two rounds, an operator manipulated the haptic device to control the bending knob's rotation (from 0° to approximately 11°). During each manipulation, the bending section of the flexible ureteroscope might be restricted, or not. The operator needed to rely on the force feedback to identify whether the bending movement was restricted. Each trial was repeated 10 times after the operator had tried twice. 3 RESULTS 3.1 Estimate the intrinsic forces with robot self-learning Figure 9 shows the results of the neural networks in predicting the intrinsic forces on part of the test set of generated random manipulation. The curves of estimated intrinsic forces mostly coincide with the curves of actual intrinsic forces. Furthermore, Table 3 shows the specific prediction errors of the neural networks on the whole test set. In general, the results show that the neural networks can predict the intrinsic forces well when the flexible ureteroscope is moving freely, and the performances of the three neural networks are similar. However, compared with Figure 9B,C, the axial force sensor readings (Figure 9A) seem to be a little far from the values of the other three prediction methods. It indicates that the relative error of the intrinsic axial force estimation is relatively large. This is because there is relatively large uncertainty and inconsistency in the influence of rotation movement on the axial sensor (as shown in Figure 4A) which may be caused by the machining and assembling variation and unstable friction. However, the maximum value of the intrinsic axial force is small, hence a slightly larger relative error is still acceptable.

Moreover, on the manual master-slave manipulation, the neural networks can still present good predictions and perform alike (as shown in Figure 10), although their errors (Table 4) are slightly larger than before (Table 3). Additionally, for similar reasons, the relative error of the intrinsic axial force estimation is also relatively large. However, on balance, the neural networks can be successfully transferred to manual master-slave manipulation.

The direct method shown in Figure 11 is to use the joint sensor readings directly as the estimated interactive axial force, while the neural network methods (MLP, LSTM and GRU) will subtract the intrinsic forces predicted by the neural networks from the sensor readings. As the figures show, the curves of estimated interactive force mostly coincide with the curve of actual values, and the neural network methods perform better in estimating the actual interactive axial force than the direct method. The mean absolute errors of neural network methods (MLP, LSTM and GRU) are approximately 0.26 N (Table 5), which is approximately 0.1 N (28%) lower than that of the direct method.

Further experiments show that in all 10 trials the operator could successfully become aware that the flexible ureteroscope was stuck by the limit block and stopped withdrawing in time, which protected the flexible ureteroscope from damage. Furthermore, Figure 12 shows the magnitude of the actual stuck force and the feedback force each time the operator became aware of the stuck event. The average of actual stuck forces in 10 trials is 1.202 N, and the average of feedback forces is similar, which is 1.136 N. FIGURE 12 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint The actual stuck force and feedback force when the operator perceives the obstruction during withdrawing the flexible ureteroscope 3.2.2 Axial torque A confusion matrix (Figure 13) was made based on the operator's judgements and the ground truth of whether the flexible ureteroscope was stuck. The diagonal of the confusion matrix is the trials of correct judgements, while the inverse diagonal is the trials of wrong judgements. As the results show, the operator successfully identified the five trials in which the flexible ureteroscope was stuck and another five trials in which it was not stuck. Furthermore, Figure 14 shows the actual interactive axial torque and the estimated interactive axial torque when the operator became aware of the stuck event, of which the averages are 15.57 and 19.09 mN·m respectively (excluding the outlier set).

LSTM, long short-term memory 3.2.3 Bending torque The operator's judgements of whether the bending was restricted were made into a confusion matrix (Figure 15). The elements on the confusion matrix's diagonal represent the trials of correct judgements, while its inverse diagonal elements represent the trials of wrong judgements. As the results show when displaying the whole bending knob's torque to the operator, the accuracy of the judgements was only 50% (Figure 15A). After the augmented force feedback strategy had been applied, the operator's judgements were all correct (Figure 15B), because the interference of intrinsic torque to the operator is eliminated by the neural network. FIGURE 15 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint The confusion matrix of the operator's judgements on anomaly during bending. (A) Displaying the whole bending knob's torque. (B) Applying the augmented force feedback strategy 4 DISCUSSION A novel highly integrated robotic system with force feedback function is proposed for FURS in this article. Compared with the state-of-the-art robot for FURS, the proposed robotic system has a more comprehensive force feedback function including axial force, axial torque, and bending knob's torque, which is important for master-slave-controlled surgical robots. Moreover, experiments have also been carried out to preliminarily verify the force feedback function of our system. Sensing interactive forces is usually the first step for force feedback. Although a miniature fibre sensor23 placed at the distal end of the flexible ureteroscope can precisely measure the interactive forces, it has disadvantages such as occupying the working channel and can not measure the force on the whole flexible shaft. Hence, we here adopt the method of installing force/torque sensors at the slave robot's joints to estimate the overall interactive forces exerted on the flexible ureteroscope. Furthermore, a method based on robot self-learning is proposed to eliminate the intrinsic forces that are generated by overcoming the structural factors of the robot and flexible ureteroscope themselves, such as gravity and friction. In this way, the feedback forces can better represent the actual interactive forces, thereby augmenting the operator's perception. When training our neural networks for modelling these intrinsic forces, no external sensors were used. It only needed to utilise the slave robot's own movement and sensors, as if the robot became familiar with its body by waving the limbs, hence we here call it robot self-learning. This can also be understood as a deviation measuring method: we train the neural networks to fit the distribution of joint sensor readings under free movements; when the flexible ureteroscope is interacting with the environment, the distribution of sensor readings will deviate from what is fitted by the neural networks. We here use simple subtraction to represent this deviation and then display it to the operator. For axial force and torque, this representation is approximately linear because the interactive force and torque can be regarded as directly superimposed on the joint sensor; for bending torque, due to the special cable-driven structure of the flexible ureteroscope, the interactive force will be reflected in the knob's torque in a nonlinear way24 when it's bending. The flexible ureteroscope may be stuck in the urinary system during FURS. Urologists need to be aware of it and take action in time,14-16 or severe complications will be caused. Moreover, the flexible shaft is inside the patient's urinary system, and the urologist can only see the endoscopic view in front of the scope. So it's difficult to know the state of the whole flexible shaft unless using the X-ray. Hence, force feedback is quite important for judging the flexible ureteroscope's state. The experimental results in this paper show that with our force feedback function, the operator can feel the obstruction when withdrawing the flexible ureteroscope. Ulvik and Wentzel-Larsen25 reports that in ureteroscopy the average force during withdrawing ureteroscope is approximately from 3.3 to 7.5 N. Although the ureteroscope in that reference is not flexible, it implies the magnitude of the force that the human urinary system can withstand, which is larger than the minimum average force that the operator became aware of the obstruction in our experiment – 1.2 N (Figure 12). Therefore, it indicates that our axial force feedback will be useful in clinic. Additionally, when the neural networks were applied, the mean absolute error of predicting interactive axial force decreased by 28% (Table 5). It shows that the method based on robot self-learning can eliminate the patterned fluctuations of sensor readings, which helps increase the accuracy of estimating actual interactive forces. Noted that there is also the situation of being stuck when pushing forward the flexible ureteroscope. In most cases, pulling and pushing the endoscope is equivalent for the force feedback system. However, in rare circumstances, if most of the flexible shaft of the endoscope is outside the body, the shaft will bend into a C-shape by a small pushing force. In this situation, there is a possibility that the force feedback system cannot detect the C-shape bending. However, we can use vision to make up for the limitation of force feedback and tackle this problem. Actually, in clinical practice, surgeons also make decisions based on multiple senses including force sensing and vision. More specifically, we can broadcast in vitro operation scene to the surgeon in real-time. The surgeon can directly see whether the flexible ureteroscope outside the body is abnormal, such as C-shape bending. More intelligently, we can adopt deep learning-based computer vision technology to assist in the analysis of in vitro surgical scenes and automatically identify whether there is a C-shape bending, and then inform the surgeon in time. Similarly, the force feedback of axial torque also helps the operator find out whether the flexible ureteroscope rotates smoothly. Although the prediction error of the neural networks is slightly large, feedback strategies properly designed (such as Algorithm 2 in Appendix A2) are beneficial to identifying the rotation anomaly. In the experiments, when the axial torque exerted on the flexible ureteroscope was approximately greater than 15.6 mN·m, the operator could accurately identify the obstruction during rotation movement (Figures 13 and 14). However, a potential limitation is that 15.6 mN·m is a relatively large torque for the flexible shaft of the flexible ureteroscope, which may limit the occasions where the force feedback of axial torque works. For the bending of the flexible ureteroscope's distal end, the augmented force feedback strategy of eliminating the intrinsic torque in real-time can help the operator become aware of the abnormal bending more accurately (Figure 15). If we simply display the whole torque of the bending knob to the operator, the operator needs to perceive the subtle change, tens of millinewton meters, in a few hundred millinewton meters of intrinsic torque, which is quite difficult (Figure 15A). However, with the augmented force feedback strategy, the torque deviation from normal bending will be displayed to the operator, not including the huge intrinsic torque. Thus the accuracy of the operator's judgements was improved (Figure 15B). Additionally, another advantage of augmented force feedback is improving ergonomics. In conventional FURS, the urologist needs to take much effort to rotate the bending knob,26 but this intrinsic torque of the knob is now eliminated in our robotic system, and the urologist can easily control the bending movement. Although the advantages of the force feedback function in our robot are preliminarily verified, the force perception is relatively subjective and only one operator participated in our experiments. Therefore, to evaluate the effect of the proposed force feedback function more objectively, more operators including urologists and trainees are needed to participate in the experiments in future work. In addition, in vivo experiments are needed to further verify the function. In addition, an important feature of the method based on robot self-learning is that no manual manipulation is needed for training the neural networks. Hence, the transfer performance from generated manipulation to manual manipulation is quite important. Although in our paper the neural networks can be transferred to manual manipulation, the error increases (Tables 3 and 4). It may be due to the difference between generated manipulation and manual manipulation. Therefore, in future work, making the generated manipulation more similar to the manual master-slave operation may be a way to improve the transferability. For example, adopting generative adversarial networks (GAN) to generate more similar manipulation. Furthermore, there seems to be an overall offset when the neural networks estimate the axial force sensor readings (Figure 10A), which may be caused by an imperfect homing procedure. Hysteresis exists in the relationship between axial force and rotation angle (Figure 4A), indicating that it is trajectory-dependent. Therefore, it's necessary to return to the home position with the same trajectory in future work. Moreover, a threshold strategy is used in the feedback of axial torque and bending knob's torque, which means that the torque below the threshold will be sacrificed, but it will improve the stability and consistency of the operator's feelings. Additionally, the operator's feelings are also related to the haptic device. A haptic device with higher precision, usually more expensive, may help improve the performance of force feedback. However, the cost-benefit ratio needs to be considered meanwhile. In summary, a novel robotic system with force feedback function for FURS is proposed in this paper, which is expected to improve the safety of robot-assisted FURS.

A systematic review of automated systems for real-time irrigation management

1. INTRODUCTION
The challenge of feeding a growing population with finite resources is becoming increasingly pressing. By 2050, the world population is expected to reach 9.7 billion, necessitating a 70% increase in food production (Falkenmark and Rockstrom, 2009). Irrigation plays a crucial role in enhancing crop yields and agricultural productivity to meet this growing demand. Studies have shown that irrigation can significantly increase crop water productivity, contributing to increased food production (Ali and Talukder, 2008; Playan and Mateos, 2005). However, water scarcity poses a significant challenge, with many regions facing water deficits and the need for improved water management practices (Falkenmark and Rockstrom, 2009). Optimizing irrigation schedules and doses based on crop requirements and environmental conditions is essential for maximizing yield and quality while minimizing water use (Zhang et al., 2024). The necessity of scalable water-efficient practices for increasing food demand cannot be overstated. Techniques such as regulated deficit irrigation, magnetically treated water, and the use of drought-tolerant crops like sorghum have shown promise in improving water productivity and ensuring food security (Mehmood et al., 2023; Putti et al., 2023; Hadebe et al., 2016). As the global food challenge intensifies, it is imperative to critically evaluate the current state and future potential of irrigation management systems to guide research, innovation, and implementation efforts towards fully autonomous, scalable solutions.

Despite the importance of irrigation in addressing the global food challenge, traditional irrigation management techniques, such as manual scheduling and timer-based systems, have significant limitations. These methods are often labor-intensive, inefficient, and less adaptable to changing conditions (Savin et al., 2023). Manual and timer-based scheduling can lead to high operational costs and inefficient water use (Raghavendra, Han, and Shin, 2023). The reliance on manual intervention and predetermined schedules limits their adaptability to changing environmental conditions, crop water requirements, and soil moisture levels (Kaptein et al., 2019). Sensor-based irrigation systems offer an alternative, enabling real-time adjustments based on soil water status measurements (Kaptein et al., 2019). However, the adoption of these systems in commercial settings has been limited, often requiring extensive input from researchers (Kim et al., 2014; Lea-Cox et al., 2018; Ristvey et al., 2018). The limitations of traditional irrigation management techniques highlight the need for scalable, automated solutions for greater efficiency in irrigation management. Automated systems that collect real-time data, analyze it, and make autonomous irrigation decisions can lead to improved water use efficiency and increased crop productivity (Champness et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2022). To fully understand the potential of automated systems, it is necessary to examine the automation of each part of the irrigation management pipeline and analyze the effectiveness and efficiency of integrated end-to-end solutions.

The emergence of smart irrigation management and IoT marks a significant shift from historical irrigation practices. Modern approaches rely on vast data and analysis algorithms, leveraging technologies such as remote sensing, sensor networks, weather data, and computational algorithms (Atanasov, 2023; Bellvert et al., 2023; Kumar et al., 2023). IoT plays a vital role in collecting vast amounts of data through sensors, data transmission, and tailored networks, enabling real-time monitoring and control of irrigation systems (Liakos, 2023; Zuckerman et al., 2024). These advancements in data collection and analysis have the potential to revolutionize irrigation management, allowing for more precise and efficient water use. However, challenges such as processing diverse data sources, data integration, and lack of integrated data analysis hamper the full benefit of IoT in irrigation management (Dave et al., 2023). The current fragmented approach in smart irrigation, focusing on individual components rather than the entire system, limits the potential for fully autonomous, real-time end-to-end irrigation management (Togneri et al., 2021). To address these challenges and fully realize the potential of smart irrigation management, there is a need for automating and integrating each section of the irrigation management pipeline, from sensor/weather data collection and transmission to processing, analysis, decision-making, and automated action (McKinion and Lemmon, 1985). This integration requires a thorough investigation of the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling seamless communication and compatibility between components within the automated irrigation management pipeline.

Machine learning (ML) plays a significant role in processing vast data, predicting plant stress, modeling climate effects, and optimizing irrigation in smart irrigation management systems. ML algorithms can analyze data collected from sensors and weather stations to determine optimal irrigation schedules (Vianny et al., 2022). However, the potential of ML is often constrained by manual steps, such as data interpretation, decision-making on irrigation timing and volume, and system adjustments. Automating ML integration to allow direct action from insights to irrigation execution, removing bottlenecks and achieving real-time adaptability, is crucial for fully autonomous irrigation management (Barzallo-Bertot et al., 2022). By integrating ML into automated systems, the irrigation management pipeline can become more seamless and efficient, enabling real-time decision-making and action based on data-driven insights. To achieve this level of automation and integration, it is essential to identify gaps and propose solutions for seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, aiming to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.

To achieve seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, interoperability and standardization are critical. Interoperability allows different system components, such as sensors, actuators, and software, to communicate and exchange data effectively, while standardization ensures that data is represented in a consistent format (Santos et al., 2020). Standardized protocols and data formats are essential for achieving seamless integration and ensuring compatibility between components in real-time irrigation management systems (Robles et al., 2022; Hatzivasilis et al., 2018). Existing and emerging standards, such as OGC SensorThings API and ISO 11783, have applicability to real-time irrigation management systems (Hazra et al., 2021). However, challenges such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security need to be addressed to fully realize the potential of interoperability and standardization in automated irrigation management systems (Hazra et al., 2021). Addressing these challenges is crucial for enabling the seamless integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline, which is essential for achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. A comprehensive evaluation of the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling the integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline is necessary to guide future research and implementation efforts.
The primary objective of this systematic review is to critically evaluate the current state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies for enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
Specific objectives include:
•	Examining the automation of each part of the irrigation management pipeline and the seamless integration of each section in the context of irrigation scheduling and management.

By addressing these objectives, this systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive and critical evaluation of the current state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems. Its intention is to guide future research, innovation, and implementation efforts to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management that can contribute to addressing the global food challenge.

3. DATA COLLECTION TO CLOUD: AUTOMATION AND REAL-TIME PROCESSING
3.1. Irrigation management data
The success of automated irrigation management systems relies heavily on the collection, transmission, and analysis of various types of data. The most applicable data types for irrigation management include soil moisture, canopy temperature, weather data, and plant physiological parameters (Farooq et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Olivier et al., 2021; Evett et al., 2020). These data are typically collected from a range of sources, including in-field sensors, remote sensing platforms, weather stations, and manual measurements (Li et al., 2019; Karimi et al., 2018).
Soil moisture data is arguably the most critical type of data for irrigation management, as it directly reflects the water available to plants and can be used to determine the optimal timing and amount of irrigation (Olivier et al., 2021; Intrigliolo & Castel, 2006). Soil moisture sensors, such as tensiometers, capacitance probes, and time-domain reflectometry (TDR) sensors, can provide real-time measurements of soil water content at various depths (Farooq et al., 2019). These sensors can be deployed in a network configuration to capture spatial variability in soil moisture across a field (Karimi et al., 2018).
Canopy temperature data is another valuable type of data for irrigation management, as it can be used to assess plant water stress and adjust irrigation accordingly (Evett et al., 2020). Infrared thermometers and thermal cameras can be used to measure canopy temperature, which is influenced by factors such as air temperature, humidity, wind speed, and plant water status (Li et al., 2019). When plants experience water stress, they tend to close their stomata to reduce water loss, leading to an increase in canopy temperature (Evett et al., 2020). By monitoring canopy temperature and comparing it to reference values, automated irrigation systems can detect plant water stress and trigger irrigation events to maintain optimal plant health and productivity (Li et al., 2019).
Weather data, including temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, and solar radiation, are essential for predicting crop water requirements and scheduling irrigation events (Akilan & Baalamurugan, 2024). Weather stations equipped with various sensors can provide real-time measurements of these parameters, which can be used as inputs for crop water requirement models, such as the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith equation (Li et al., 2019). These models estimate crop evapotranspiration (ET) based on weather data and crop-specific coefficients, allowing for the calculation of irrigation requirements (Intrigliolo & Castel, 2006). By integrating weather data into automated irrigation systems, irrigation schedules can be dynamically adjusted based on changing environmental conditions, ensuring that crops receive the optimal amount of water at the right time (Akilan & Baalamurugan, 2024).
When collecting and utilizing these data types, several considerations must be taken into account, including the volume, frequency, format, and source of the data (Farooq et al., 2019). The volume of data generated by automated irrigation systems can be substantial, especially when high-resolution sensors are deployed at a large scale (Bastidas Pacheco et al., 2022). This necessitates the use of efficient data storage, processing, and transmission technologies to handle the data load (Farooq et al., 2019). The frequency of data collection is another important consideration, as it directly impacts the temporal resolution of the data and the ability to detect rapid changes in plant water status or environmental conditions (Bastidas Pacheco et al., 2022). Bastidas Pacheco et al. (2022) demonstrated that collecting full pulse resolution data from water meters provides more accurate estimates of event occurrence, timing, and features compared to aggregated temporal resolutions, highlighting the importance of selecting appropriate data collection frequencies to ensure the quality and usefulness of the data for irrigation management.
The format of the data is also crucial, as it determines the compatibility and interoperability of the data with various analysis tools and platforms (Farooq et al., 2019). Standardized data formats, such as JSON, XML, or CSV, can facilitate data exchange and integration between different components of the automated irrigation system (Zhang et al., 2023). The source of the data is another important consideration, as it can impact the reliability, accuracy, and spatial coverage of the data (Farooq et al., 2019). For example, in-field sensors provide highly localized measurements, while remote sensing platforms, such as satellites or drones, can provide data at larger spatial scales (Li et al., 2019). By combining data from multiple sources, automated irrigation systems can achieve a more comprehensive understanding of crop water requirements and optimize irrigation management accordingly (Farooq et al., 2019).
Data quality, accuracy, and reliability are paramount in irrigation management, as they directly impact the effectiveness of decision-making processes and the efficiency of water use (Gupta et al., 2020). Inaccurate or unreliable data can lead to suboptimal irrigation decisions, resulting in crop stress, yield losses, or wasted water resources (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022). Gupta et al. (2020) emphasized the critical importance of data security and privacy in smart farming systems, as the leakage of sensitive agricultural data can cause severe economic losses to farmers and compromise the integrity of the automated irrigation system. The authors also highlighted the need for robust authentication and secure communication protocols to prevent unauthorized access to smart farming systems and protect data in transit (Gupta et al., 2020).
Ramli and Jabbar (2022) addressed the challenges associated with implementing real-time, automated irrigation systems, including data quality, scalability, reliability, and security. They proposed solutions and best practices based on the analysis of case studies and real-world implementations, such as the use of redundant sensors, data validation techniques, and secure communication protocols (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022). The authors also emphasized the importance of regular maintenance and calibration of sensors to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the collected data (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022).
Researchers have investigated the use of data compression, aggregation, and filtering techniques to reduce bandwidth requirements and improve transmission efficiency in automated irrigation systems (Karim et al., 2023; Rady et al., 2020; Cui, 2023). Karim et al. (2023) explored the effectiveness of various data compression techniques, such as lossless and lossy compression algorithms, in reducing the size of data packets transmitted over wireless networks. The authors found that lossless compression techniques, such as Huffman coding and Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW), can significantly reduce data size without compromising data quality, while lossy compression techniques, such as JPEG and MP3, can further reduce data size by introducing acceptable levels of distortion (Karim et al., 2023).
Rady et al. (2020) developed a novel data compression algorithm specifically designed for irrigation data, which achieved significant compression ratios without compromising data quality. The authors demonstrated that their algorithm could reduce the amount of data transmitted over wireless networks, thereby improving the efficiency of the irrigation system and reducing costs (Rady et al., 2020). Cui (2023) investigated the use of data aggregation and filtering techniques to reduce the number of transmissions and save bandwidth in automated irrigation systems. The author proposed a data aggregation scheme that combines multiple sensor readings into a single value, such as the average soil moisture over a specified time interval, to reduce the frequency of data transmissions (Cui, 2023). Additionally, the author explored the use of data filtering techniques, such as Kalman filters and particle filters, to remove noise and outliers from sensor data, improving the accuracy and reliability of the transmitted information (Cui, 2023).
Data standardization and harmonization are crucial for facilitating seamless integration and interoperability between the various components of automated irrigation management systems (Zhang et al., 2023; Ermoliev et al., 2022). Zhang et al. (2023) developed a novel cyberinformatics technology called iCrop, which enables the in-season monitoring of crop-specific land cover across the contiguous United States. The authors highlighted the importance of data standardization and harmonization in the context of iCrop, as it allows for the efficient distribution of crop-specific land cover information based on the findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data principle (Zhang et al., 2023). By adopting standardized data formats and protocols, such as the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards, iCrop enables the seamless integration of various data sources and facilitates the interoperability of the system with other agricultural decision support tools (Zhang et al., 2023).
Ermoliev et al. (2022) proposed a linkage methodology for linking distributed sectoral/regional optimization models in a situation where private information is not available or cannot be shared by modeling teams. The authors emphasized the need for data standardization to enable decentralized cross-sectoral coordination and analysis, as it allows for the consistent representation and exchange of data between different models and stakeholders (Ermoliev et al., 2022). By adopting standardized data formats and interfaces, the proposed linkage methodology can facilitate the integration of various optimization models and support the development of comprehensive decision support systems for sustainable resource management (Ermoliev et al., 2022).
Metadata plays a vital role in providing context and enabling better data interpretation and decision-making in automated irrigation management systems (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021). Metadata refers to the additional information that describes the characteristics, quality, and context of the primary data, such as the sensor type, calibration parameters, measurement units, and timestamp (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021). Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al. (2021) highlighted the importance of metadata in water resources management, as it enables decision-makers to use the data to the best of its capabilities by understanding factors such as when water data was collected and what factors might have contributed to the measurements. The authors emphasized the need for standardized metadata formats and guidelines, such as the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) and the ISO 19115 standard, to ensure the consistency and interoperability of metadata across different water information systems (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021).
In the context of automated irrigation management systems, metadata can provide valuable information about the data collection process, sensor performance, and environmental conditions that can aid in data interpretation and decision-making (Cota & Mamede, 2023). For example, metadata about the sensor type and calibration parameters can help assess the accuracy and reliability of the collected data, while metadata about the weather conditions and soil properties can provide context for interpreting the data and adjusting irrigation strategies accordingly (Cota & Mamede, 2023). By incorporating metadata into the data management and analysis pipeline of automated irrigation systems, decision-makers can make more informed and context-aware decisions, leading to improved water use efficiency and crop productivity (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021).

3.2. Edge Computing and Fog Computing
Edge computing and fog computing have emerged as transformative technologies in the realm of real-time irrigation management systems, offering significant potential for improving efficiency, scalability, and reliability (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2019). Edge computing refers to the practice of processing data near the edge of the network, close to the source of the data, while fog computing is a decentralized computing infrastructure that extends cloud computing capabilities to the network edge (Hassija et al., 2019). These technologies bring computation and analytics closer to the data source, reducing the need for data to travel to the cloud and enabling faster processing and decision-making (Hassija et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020).
The potential of edge computing and fog computing in real-time irrigation management is immense. Abdel Nasser et al. (2020) proposed a two-layer system for water demand prediction using automated meters and machine learning techniques, demonstrating the potential of edge computing in improving the efficiency and scalability of irrigation management. The system collects and aggregates data from distributed smart meters in the first layer, while the second layer uses LSTM neural networks to predict water demand for different regions of households. By leveraging edge computing, the system can achieve high accuracy in predicting water demand, which is essential for efficient irrigation management (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020).
Tran et al. (2019) conducted a comprehensive review of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems, highlighting the role of fog computing in addressing data transmission challenges and enabling seamless integration across the irrigation management pipeline. The authors emphasize that real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems have the potential to significantly improve water efficiency, crop yields, and reduce labor costs. However, they also identify several challenges that need to be addressed, such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security, which can be effectively tackled by implementing fog computing architectures (Tran et al., 2019).
Edge computing offers several benefits in real-time irrigation management systems, including reduced latency, real-time decision-making, and reduced reliance on cloud connectivity (Mishra, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). By processing data closer to the source, edge computing enables faster response times and more efficient data handling (Mishra, 2020). Mishra (2020) highlights that edge computing reduces latency by processing data closer to the source, enabling real-time decision-making and lessening reliance on cloud connectivity by shifting processing to local or edge devices.
Zhang et al. (2020) explore the application of edge computing in agricultural settings, demonstrating its potential to improve the efficiency and accuracy of irrigation systems. The authors discuss how edge computing has prospects in various agricultural applications, such as pest identification, safety traceability of agricultural products, unmanned agricultural machinery, agricultural technology promotion, and intelligent management. They also emphasize that the emergence of edge computing models, such as fog computing, cloudlet, and mobile edge computing, has transformed the management and operation of farms (Zhang et al., 2020).
Fog computing plays a crucial role in distributing processing and storage across the network, enhancing the scalability and reliability of automated irrigation systems (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022; Singh et al., 2022). Premkumar and Sigappi (2022) evaluate the current state of automated irrigation management systems and propose a hybrid machine learning approach for predicting soil moisture and managing irrigation. Their study emphasizes the potential of fog computing in distributing processing and storage across the network, improving the efficiency and scalability of irrigation systems. The proposed hybrid machine learning approach outperforms other machine learning algorithms in predicting soil moisture, demonstrating the effectiveness of fog computing in enhancing the performance of automated irrigation systems (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022).
Singh et al. (2022) discuss the role of fog computing in distributing processing and storage across the network, enhancing scalability and reliability in agricultural management systems. The authors argue that by implementing fog computing, these systems can achieve faster data processing and response times, improving overall efficiency and effectiveness. They also highlight that fog computing can address the challenges faced by real-time data transmission in agricultural management systems, such as latency, bandwidth limitations, and data security (Singh et al., 2022).
The integration of edge and fog computing in real-time irrigation management systems is crucial for achieving fully automated, scalable, and reliable solutions. As the demand for autonomous irrigation management grows, these technologies will play a pivotal role in enabling faster decision-making, reduced latency, improved resource utilization, and seamless integration across the irrigation management pipeline (Tran et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020). By bringing computation and analytics closer to the data source and distributing processing and storage across the network, edge and fog computing can significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of automated irrigation systems, contributing to the overall goal of addressing the global food challenge through optimized water resource management and increased agricultural productivity (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022; Singh et al., 2022).

3.3. Automation of Data Collection
The automation of data collection is a critical component in the development of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies. It enables the efficient gathering of vital information about crop health, environmental conditions, and water requirements, which is essential for enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity. Two key aspects of automated data collection are the use of advanced sensing technologies for non-invasive plant stress detection and the implementation of wireless sensor networks and energy-efficient communication protocols for large-scale, long-term data collection.
Advanced sensing technologies, such as hyperspectral imaging and thermal sensing, have emerged as powerful tools for non-invasive plant stress detection in automated irrigation management systems. These technologies provide valuable information about crop traits, enabling early and accurate detection of plant health issues (Triantafyllou et al., 2019). Triantafyllou et al. (2019) propose a comprehensive reference architecture model that incorporates advanced sensing technologies in the sensor layer for real-time plant stress detection, highlighting their importance in providing non-invasive plant stress detection. Similarly, Hossain et al. (2023) present a novel IoT-ML-Blockchain integrated framework for smart agricultural management that leverages advanced sensing technologies to optimize water use and improve crop yield, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
Hyperspectral imaging can capture subtle changes in plant physiology that are indicative of stress, while machine learning algorithms can be employed to extract meaningful patterns from the spectral data and classify different stress types (Araus et al., 2014). Thermal sensing can detect changes in canopy temperature, which is influenced by factors such as plant water status (Li et al., 2019). By monitoring canopy temperature and comparing it to reference values, automated irrigation systems can detect plant water stress and trigger irrigation events to maintain optimal plant health and productivity (Li et al., 2019).
The integration of advanced sensing technologies in automated irrigation management systems has the potential to revolutionize precision agriculture. Jiang et al. (2019) demonstrate the effectiveness of a deep learning-based model in accurately detecting leaf spot diseases, highlighting the importance of image augmentation and deep learning algorithms in enhancing the model's performance.
Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and energy-efficient communication protocols have the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and reliability of data collection in large-scale, long-term irrigation systems. WSNs offer a cost-effective and scalable solution for real-time data collection in large-scale irrigation systems, providing remote monitoring and automated control capabilities (Mehdizadeh et al., 2020). Nishiura and Yamamoto (2021) propose a novel sensor network system that utilizes drones and wireless power transfer to autonomously collect environmental data from sensor nodes in vast agricultural fields, reducing operational costs and enhancing the efficiency of data collection. Similarly, Higashiura and Yamamoto (2021) introduce a network system that employs UAVs and LoRa communication to efficiently collect environmental data from sensor nodes distributed across large farmlands, optimizing data collection and reducing travel distance and time.
Energy-efficient communication protocols are crucial for ensuring reliable data transmission in challenging environmental conditions and extending the lifespan of sensor nodes (Mehdizadeh et al., 2020). Al-Ali et al. (2023) investigate the potential of WSNs and energy-efficient communication protocols for data collection in large-scale, long-term irrigation systems, discussing the challenges and opportunities of using these technologies to improve the efficiency and reliability of real-time data collection in irrigation management. Mehdizadeh et al. (2020) emphasize the need for careful consideration of factors such as data accuracy, energy consumption, and network reliability when designing effective WSNs for irrigation management, enabling timely irrigation decisions and improved crop yields.
The automation of data collection through the use of advanced sensing technologies and wireless sensor networks is essential for achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. By enabling non-invasive plant stress detection and large-scale, long-term data collection, these technologies contribute to the overall goal of optimizing water resource management and increasing agricultural productivity. The integration of these technologies in real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems has the potential to enhance agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity, ultimately contributing to the development of fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management solutions.

3.4: Real-Time Data Transmission Protocols and Technologies
Real-time data transmission is a critical component of automated irrigation management systems, as it enables the timely delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of suitable protocols and network architectures is essential for ensuring efficient and reliable data transmission in these systems, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
The Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol has emerged as a popular choice for real-time data transmission in IoT networks, including those used for automated irrigation management. MQTT is a lightweight, publish-subscribe protocol designed for constrained devices and low-bandwidth networks (Author, 2019). Its simplicity and low overhead make it well-suited for IoT applications where data transmission speed and energy efficiency are critical (Saranyadevi et al., 2022). MQTT provides three Quality of Service (QoS) levels, ensuring data reliability in real-time scenarios (Author, 2019). Chen et al. (2020) proposed novel algorithms to improve data exchange efficiency and handle rerouting in MQTT-based IoT networks for automated irrigation management systems. Their TBRouting algorithm efficiently finds the shortest paths for data transmission, while the Rerouting algorithm effectively handles the rerouting of topic-based session flows when a broker crashes. The combination of these algorithms can significantly improve the performance and reliability of automated irrigation management systems (Chen et al., 2020).
Client-server IoT networks, such as those based on MQTT, play a crucial role in real-time data transmission for automated irrigation management systems. In these networks, sensors and devices (clients) publish data to a central broker (server), which then distributes the data to subscribed clients (Verma et al., 2021). This architecture enables efficient data collection, processing, and dissemination, facilitating the integration of various components within the automated irrigation management pipeline. Verma et al. (2021) proposed an architecture for healthcare monitoring systems using IoT and communication protocols, which provides a comprehensive overview of existing approaches and highlights challenges and opportunities in the field. Although focused on healthcare, the insights from this study can be applied to automated irrigation management systems, emphasizing the importance of interoperability and standardization for seamless integration (Verma et al., 2021).
In addition to MQTT, other application layer protocols such as XMPP, CoAP, SOAP, and HTTP have been explored for real-time data transmission in IoT networks. Each protocol has its strengths and weaknesses, making them suitable for different applications and scenarios. XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) is an open-standard protocol that supports real-time messaging, presence, and request-response services (Saint-Andre, 2011). CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) is a specialized web transfer protocol designed for use with constrained nodes and networks in the Internet of Things (Shelby et al., 2014). SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services, while HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web (Fielding et al., 1999).
Motamedi and Villányi (2022) compared and evaluated wireless communication protocols for the implementation of smart irrigation systems in greenhouses, considering factors such as power consumption, range, reliability, and scalability. They found that ZigBee is the most suitable local communication protocol for greenhouse irrigation due to its large number of nodes and long range, while MQTT is the recommended messaging protocol for smart irrigation systems due to its TCP transport protocol and quality of service (QoS) options. GSM is a reliable and cost-effective global communication protocol for greenhouse irrigation, providing wide coverage and low cost (Motamedi & Villányi, 2022).
Syafarinda et al. (2018) investigated the use of the MQTT protocol in a precision agriculture system using a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). They found that MQTT is suitable for use in IoT applications due to its lightweight, simple, and low bandwidth requirements. The average data transmission speed using the MQTT protocol was approximately 1 second, demonstrating its effectiveness for real-time data transmission in precision agriculture systems (Syafarinda et al., 2018).
The choice of application layer protocol for real-time irrigation management depends on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. MQTT and RTPS (Real-Time Publish-Subscribe) are both suitable for real-time data transmission in IoT systems, but they have different strengths and weaknesses. MQTT is a better choice for applications that require low latency and high throughput, while RTPS is a better choice for applications that require high reliability and low latency (Sanchez-Iborra & Skarmeta, 2021). The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of various application layer protocols, provides valuable insights into the suitability of these technologies for real-time data transmission in automated irrigation management systems.
In summary, real-time data transmission protocols and technologies play a vital role in the automation of irrigation management systems, enabling the efficient and reliable delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of application layer protocols, highlights the importance of selecting suitable technologies based on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. By leveraging these technologies, automated irrigation management systems can achieve seamless integration and contribute to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.

3.5. Challenges and Solutions in Real-Time Data Transmission
Following the exploration of data collection, processing at the edge and fog, and automation in previous sections, we now turn to the critical aspect of real-time data transmission. While essential for automated irrigation management, this stage presents unique challenges that must be addressed to ensure system efficiency and reliability.
Obstacles in Real-Time Data Transmission
Agricultural environments present unique challenges for real-time data transmission, directly impacting the effectiveness of automated irrigation systems. Environmental factors can significantly disrupt wireless communication. Adverse weather conditions such as heavy rain, fog, and high winds can weaken or even block radio signals, leading to data loss and compromised system performance. Physical obstacles like trees, buildings, and uneven terrain further complicate signal propagation, creating reliability issues (Jukan et al., 2017; Yi & Ji, 2014; Zhang, Chang & Baoguo, 2018). These environmental challenges necessitate robust communication protocols and network architectures that can ensure consistent and reliable data flow.
In addition to environmental factors, technical limitations also present significant obstacles. Large-scale agricultural operations often demand long-distance data transmission, which can be hindered by the limited range of certain wireless communication protocols. Network congestion, occurring when multiple sensors transmit data concurrently, can lead to delays and potential data loss, further complicating real-time decision-making (Hameed et al., 2020). To mitigate these issues, researchers have investigated the potential of cognitive radio networks (CRNs) and dynamic spectrum access (DSA) for optimizing spectrum utilization and reducing interference (Righi et al., 2017; Shafi et al., 2018; Trigka & Dritsas, 2022). CRNs enable devices to intelligently sense and adapt to the surrounding radio environment, dynamically adjusting transmission parameters to avoid interference and improve communication efficiency. DSA, on the other hand, facilitates the dynamic allocation of unused spectrum, enhancing spectrum utilization and reducing congestion.
Furthermore, data security and privacy are paramount concerns in real-time irrigation systems. The sensitive nature of agricultural data, such as crop yields and farm management practices, necessitates robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches (Gupta et al., 2020). Implementing secure communication protocols, authentication mechanisms, and encryption techniques is essential to protect data integrity and ensure the trustworthiness of the system.
Investigating Data Optimization Techniques
To enhance the efficiency and reliability of real-time data transmission in automated irrigation systems, researchers have explored a range of data optimization techniques. Data compression techniques aim to reduce the size of data packets transmitted over the network, minimizing bandwidth requirements and improving transmission speed (Rady et al., 2020; Karim et al., 2023). Lossless compression algorithms, such as Huffman coding and LZW, preserve data integrity while effectively reducing data size, ensuring that no information is lost during transmission (Cui, 2023). Lossy compression algorithms, such as JPEG and MP3, offer higher compression ratios but introduce a controlled level of data loss, which may be acceptable for certain applications where some loss of precision is tolerable (Karim et al., 2023). The choice between lossless and lossy compression depends on the specific application and the trade-off between data size and accuracy.
Data aggregation techniques provide another effective approach to optimize data transmission. By aggregating multiple sensor readings into a single representative value, such as average soil moisture or temperature, the number of transmissions can be significantly reduced, conserving bandwidth and energy resources (Cui, 2023). This is particularly beneficial in large-scale irrigation systems where numerous sensors are deployed across vast areas, generating substantial amounts of data. Additionally, data filtering techniques play a crucial role in improving data quality and reliability. Kalman filters and particle filters can effectively remove noise and outliers from sensor data, ensuring that only accurate and relevant information is transmitted and used for decision-making (Cui, 2023). This is essential for preventing erroneous data from influencing irrigation decisions and potentially leading to suboptimal water management.
Sensor calibration, drift correction, and fault detection are essential for maintaining data accuracy and reliability (Dos Santos et al., 2023). Regular calibration ensures that sensors provide accurate measurements over time, while drift correction techniques account for gradual changes in sensor readings due to environmental factors or aging. Fault detection mechanisms can identify and address sensor malfunctions or anomalies, preventing erroneous data from influencing irrigation decisions and potentially harming crops or wasting water.
Addressing the Challenges
Effectively addressing the challenges in real-time data transmission requires a multifaceted approach that encompasses environmental, technical, and data-related considerations. Implementing robust and adaptive communication protocols is crucial for overcoming interference and signal degradation caused by weather conditions and physical obstacles. Selecting appropriate protocols, such as LoRa or ZigBee, with suitable range and penetration capabilities can ensure reliable data transmission in challenging agricultural environments (Motamedi & Villányi, 2022). Additionally, employing techniques like frequency hopping and error correction codes can further improve communication resilience and mitigate data loss.
Optimizing network architecture is another key consideration. Deploying a distributed network architecture with edge and fog computing capabilities can significantly enhance data processing and transmission efficiency (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2019). Edge devices can perform initial data processing and aggregation tasks, reducing the amount of data transmitted to the cloud and minimizing latency, while fog nodes can provide additional processing power and storage closer to the data source, enhancing scalability and reliability. This distributed approach alleviates the burden on the central cloud server and allows for more responsive and efficient irrigation management.
Data optimization techniques play a vital role in reducing bandwidth requirements and improving transmission efficiency. The choice of data compression, aggregation, and filtering techniques should be tailored to the specific requirements of the irrigation system, considering factors such as data type, accuracy needs, and available bandwidth. By carefully selecting and implementing these techniques, the overall performance and effectiveness of real-time irrigation systems can be significantly enhanced, leading to more sustainable water management practices and improved agricultural productivity.
By addressing these challenges and implementing appropriate solutions, real-time data transmission can become a reliable and efficient component of automated irrigation systems, contributing to the overall goal of achieving sustainable and productive agriculture in the face of growing food demands and water scarcity.

3.6. IoT Network Architectures and Variable Rate Irrigation (VRI) for Real-Time Irrigation
Real-time irrigation management systems heavily rely on the efficient and reliable transmission of data from sensors and weather stations to the cloud for processing and decision-making. However, agricultural environments present unique challenges to wireless communication, including adverse weather conditions, physical obstacles, and the limitations of wireless technologies. These challenges necessitate robust and adaptive solutions to ensure the consistent and timely flow of data, enabling truly autonomous irrigation scheduling.
Environmental factors, such as heavy rain, fog, and strong winds, can significantly disrupt wireless communication by attenuating or even blocking radio signals, leading to data loss and compromised system performance (Ed-daoudi et al., 2023; Jukan et al., 2017; Yi & Ji, 2014; Zhang, Chang & Baoguo, 2018). Dense vegetation, buildings, and uneven terrain create further complications by causing multipath propagation and shadowing effects (Yim et al., 2018; Gautam and Pagay, 2020). The study by Yim et al. (2018) on LoRa networks in a tree farm environment exemplifies these challenges, revealing reduced communication range and data reliability compared to theoretical expectations. This underscores the need for carefully selecting and optimizing communication protocols and network parameters to ensure reliable data transmission in such environments.
The study by Guzinski et al. (2014a) using a modified TSEB model further highlights the importance of high-resolution data in accurately capturing the spatial and temporal dynamics of energy fluxes influenced by environmental factors. This emphasizes the need for advanced data acquisition and processing techniques that can effectively represent the complexities of agricultural settings.
The limitations of traditional wireless communication technologies, such as limited range and network congestion, pose additional challenges for large-scale agricultural operations. Long-distance data transmission can be hindered by range limitations, while network congestion arising from numerous sensors transmitting concurrently can lead to delays and data loss, hindering real-time decision-making (Hameed et al., 2020). Addressing these challenges requires the exploration of advanced networking technologies that can optimize spectrum utilization, mitigate interference, and improve reliability and efficiency.
Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) and Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) offer promising solutions for optimizing wireless communication in agricultural settings. CRNs empower devices with the ability to intelligently sense and adapt to the surrounding radio environment, dynamically adjusting transmission parameters to avoid interference and improve communication efficiency (Righi et al., 2017; Shafi et al., 2018; Trigka & Dritsas, 2022). Research has explored the potential of CRNs in predicting Radio Frequency (RF) power to avoid noisy channels and optimize spectrum utilization (Iliya et al., 2014; Iliya et al., 2014). These studies demonstrate the effectiveness of combining optimization algorithms with artificial neural networks (ANNs) to enhance the accuracy and generalization of RF power prediction, enabling CRNs to make informed decisions about channel selection and avoid interference.
DSA complements CRN technology by dynamically allocating unused spectrum, further enhancing spectrum utilization and reducing congestion (Shi et al., 2023). The numerical model developed by Shi et al. (2023) showcases the potential of CRNs and DSA for optimizing wireless communication in challenging environments.
The integration of CRNs and DSA into the IoT network architecture requires careful consideration of spectrum sensing techniques, network topology, and data security. Research on cooperative spectrum sensing suggests that distributed approaches, where sensor nodes collaborate and share information, can significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of spectrum sensing, particularly in dynamic environments (Trigka and Dritsas, 2022; Khalid & Yu, 2019). This collaborative approach enables a more comprehensive understanding of the radio environment and facilitates the identification of available frequency bands for data transmission.
The choice of network topology also impacts the performance and scalability of CRN-based irrigation systems. Mesh networks, where sensor nodes are interconnected and relay data for each other, offer enhanced resilience and coverage compared to star topologies where nodes communicate directly with a central gateway (Akyildiz & Vuran, 2010). However, mesh networks can be more complex to manage and may introduce additional routing overhead. The trade-off between network resilience and complexity needs to be carefully evaluated to select the most appropriate topology for a specific agricultural setting.
Data security and privacy are paramount concerns in IoT-based irrigation systems due to the sensitive nature of agricultural data (Gupta et al., 2020). Implementing secure communication protocols, authentication mechanisms, and encryption techniques is essential for protecting data integrity and ensuring system trustworthiness. Research on secure spectrum leasing and resource allocation algorithms for CR-WSN-based irrigation systems has demonstrated the potential of these technologies for enhancing security and efficiency (Hassan, 2023; Afghah et al., 2018).
In conclusion, the development of effective and reliable real-time irrigation management systems requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the challenges of data transmission in agricultural environments. The integration of robust and adaptive communication protocols, optimized network architectures, and advanced networking technologies like CRNs and DSA, along with a focus on data security and privacy, can contribute significantly to achieving the goal of autonomous and efficient irrigation scheduling.
4. AUTOMATED DATA PROCESSING IN THE CLOUD
4.1. Data Quality and Preprocessing
Data quality is paramount in automated irrigation systems as it directly influences the effectiveness of decision-making and water use efficiency. Issues like missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers arising from sensor malfunctions, environmental interference, or network problems (Lv et al., 2023) can significantly impact the performance of machine learning models used for irrigation scheduling and management.
Real-time data cleaning techniques are essential for addressing these challenges. Kalman filtering proves particularly effective in handling missing values and correcting erroneous readings by recursively estimating the system's state based on previous measurements and current sensor data, taking into account noise and uncertainty (Kim et al., 2020). Moving average techniques, by averaging consecutive data points, provide a more stable representation of the underlying trend, filtering out short-term fluctuations (Chhetri, 2023). For outlier detection, adaptive thresholding methods offer a dynamic approach, adjusting thresholds based on the statistical properties of the data to effectively identify anomalies and minimize false positives (Bah et al., 2021). These techniques are crucial in maintaining the integrity of real-time data streams and ensuring the accuracy of subsequent analyses.
Adaptive data preprocessing is essential for managing the diversity of data sources and formats commonly found in irrigation systems. Data normalization techniques, such as min-max scaling or z-score normalization, ensure that all features contribute equally to the analysis by transforming data values to a common scale (Pradal et al., 2016). This is crucial for preventing features with larger values from dominating the analysis and ensuring that all features are given equal consideration. Similarly, feature scaling methods, like standardization or normalization, optimize the range of feature values to improve the performance and convergence of machine learning models (Tortorici et al., 2024). By scaling features to a similar range, the influence of outliers is reduced, and the model's ability to learn from the data is enhanced.
Data fusion techniques play a critical role in integrating information from diverse sources, creating a more comprehensive and reliable dataset for irrigation management. Dempster-Shafer theory, a generalization of probability theory, allows for the expression of both uncertainty and the degree of conflict in evidence, making it suitable for fusing uncertain and conflicting data from heterogeneous sources (Sadiq and Rodriguez, 2004). This is particularly relevant in irrigation systems where data from different sensors may provide slightly different or even contradictory information due to sensor variations or environmental factors. Bayesian inference offers another powerful framework for combining information from multiple sources, updating the probability of a hypothesis as new evidence becomes available. By applying these techniques, data from soil moisture sensors, canopy temperature sensors, weather stations, and other sources can be integrated to provide a holistic understanding of crop water requirements and environmental conditions, leading to more informed and accurate irrigation decisions.
The impact of data quality extends beyond model accuracy to the robustness of machine learning models under varying conditions. Robust models should maintain consistent performance even when faced with data inconsistencies or unexpected situations. Techniques like data augmentation and domain adaptation can enhance model robustness by exposing the model to a wider range of data variations during training. Data augmentation involves generating additional training data by applying transformations or introducing noise to existing data, making the model more resilient to noise and variations in the real-world data. Domain adaptation techniques aim to adapt a model trained on one domain (e.g., a specific crop or geographic location) to perform well on another domain with different data characteristics. This is particularly relevant in irrigation management, where models may need to be applied to different crops, soil types, or climatic conditions.
The choice of data cleaning, preprocessing, and fusion techniques should be carefully considered based on the specific characteristics of the irrigation system and the available data. By selecting and implementing appropriate techniques, the accuracy, reliability, and robustness of machine learning models can be significantly improved, leading to more efficient and sustainable irrigation management practices.
4.2. Scalable and Autonomous Deployment using Containerization Strategies
The transition from data collection and transmission to efficient data processing requires a robust infrastructure capable of handling diverse workloads and data volumes. Containerization technologies, specifically Docker and Kubernetes, offer a promising solution for deploying and scaling data processing and machine learning modules within cloud environments like AWS, Azure, and GCP (Vargas-Rojas et al., 2024; Rosendo et al., 2022; Solayman & Qasha, 2023). Docker provides a standardized way to package applications and their dependencies into self-contained units known as containers, ensuring consistent and reproducible execution across different platforms (Rosendo et al., 2022). Kubernetes, acting as a container orchestrator, manages their deployment, scaling, and networking across a cluster of machines (Rosendo et al., 2022). This combination presents several advantages for automated irrigation management systems.
Firstly, containerization facilitates efficient resource utilization and scalability. By encapsulating applications and their dependencies, containers enable the isolation of resources and prevent conflicts between different modules (Vargas-Rojas et al., 2024; Solayman & Qasha, 2023). This isolation allows for the efficient allocation of resources, such as CPU, memory, and storage, to each container based on its specific needs. Kubernetes further enhances scalability by allowing for the automatic scaling of containers based on real-time demand, ensuring the system can adapt to varying workloads and data volumes, preventing bottlenecks, and ensuring responsiveness to changing conditions (Karamolegkos et al., 2023).
Secondly, containerization promotes portability and reproducibility. By packaging applications and their dependencies into a single unit, containers make it easy to move and deploy them across different cloud environments without the need for environment-specific configurations (Rosendo et al., 2022; Solayman & Qasha, 2023). This portability simplifies the development and deployment process, reducing the time and effort required to set up and manage the system. Additionally, containers ensure reproducibility by providing a consistent execution environment, regardless of the underlying infrastructure. This eliminates variability and ensures that the system will behave consistently across different deployments (Zhou et al., 2023).
Optimizing container orchestration and resource allocation is crucial to minimizing latency and maximizing throughput in real-time data processing pipelines. Techniques like auto-scaling and dynamic resource allocation play a critical role in this context (Hethcoat et al., 2024; Werner and Tai, 2023; Kumar et al., 2024). Auto-scaling automatically adjusts the number of container instances based on real-time demand, ensuring that sufficient resources are available to handle peak workloads while avoiding over-provisioning during periods of low demand (Hethcoat et al., 2024; Kumar et al., 2024). Dynamic resource allocation enables the fine-grained adjustment of resources allocated to each container based on its specific needs and the current workload (Werner and Tai, 2023). This ensures efficient resource allocation and provides each container with the necessary resources to perform its tasks effectively.
Performance monitoring tools, such as Kubernetes Metrics Server and Prometheus, are essential for gaining insights into the performance of containers and the overall system (Hethcoat et al., 2024; Kuity & Peddoju, 2023). These tools provide valuable data on key performance indicators, such as CPU and memory usage, network traffic, and application-specific metrics. By monitoring this data, administrators can identify bottlenecks, optimize resource allocation strategies, and continuously improve system performance (Hethcoat et al., 2024). This data-driven approach ensures that automated irrigation management systems can operate efficiently and reliably.
By integrating containerization technologies with optimization techniques and performance monitoring, automated irrigation management systems achieve the scalability, autonomy, and efficiency required for effective real-time data processing and decision-making. This approach facilitates a seamless and responsive system that can adapt to changing conditions and contribute to the overall goal of optimizing water resource management and increasing agricultural productivity.

4.3. Deploying ML Models for Data Processing
Transitioning from data collection, preprocessing, and transmission, the deployment of machine learning (ML) models marks a pivotal stage in the automated irrigation management pipeline. This stage entails utilizing cloud platforms to facilitate real-time data processing and inference, enabling data-driven decision-making for optimal irrigation management and ultimately contributing to fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.
Several architectures and frameworks exist for deploying ML models on cloud platforms, each offering unique advantages and catering to different requirements. TensorFlow Serving, for instance, provides a high-performance system specifically designed for serving TensorFlow models (Abadi et al., 2016). This framework enables efficient and scalable inference, making it suitable for real-time applications where low latency and high throughput are crucial. For instance, in a large-scale irrigation system with numerous sensors generating data continuously, TensorFlow Serving can efficiently handle the high volume of inference requests and provide timely predictions for irrigation scheduling. Similarly, Apache MXNet Model Server offers a flexible and efficient solution for deploying models trained with MXNet, supporting a wide range of deep learning models and inference backends (MXNet Developers, 2015). This versatility makes it suitable for complex irrigation systems that may utilize different types of ML models for various tasks, such as predicting crop water requirements, detecting plant stress, or forecasting weather conditions. ONNX Runtime, on the other hand, provides a cross-platform inference engine compatible with various ML frameworks, including PyTorch, TensorFlow, and MXNet (Microsoft, 2017). This versatility enables the deployment of models in diverse environments, facilitating interoperability and reducing the need for model conversion. For example, an irrigation system that uses models trained in different frameworks can utilize ONNX Runtime to deploy them on a single platform without the need for time-consuming and error-prone model conversion processes.
Choosing the appropriate architecture or framework depends on several factors, including the specific ML framework used for model training, the desired level of performance and scalability, and the need for cross-platform compatibility. For instance, if the primary concern is low latency and high throughput for real-time inference, TensorFlow Serving might be the optimal choice for TensorFlow models. However, if flexibility and support for various deep learning models are required, Apache MXNet Model Server could be more suitable. In cases where cross-platform compatibility is essential, ONNX Runtime offers a versatile solution.
Once the ML model is deployed, optimizing its performance and resource utilization becomes crucial for ensuring the efficiency of integrated end-to-end automated irrigation systems. Model compression techniques, such as pruning and quantization, offer effective methods for reducing the size and computational requirements of ML models without compromising accuracy (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). Pruning involves eliminating unnecessary connections or neurons from the model, effectively streamlining its structure and reducing computational complexity. This can be particularly beneficial for deep learning models, which often have a large number of parameters and can be prone to overfitting. By removing redundant or less important connections, pruning can improve modelgeneralizability and reduce inference time. Quantization, on the other hand, involves reducing the precision of model parameters, typically from 32-bit floating-point numbers to lower-precision formats such as 8-bit integers. This reduction in precision leads to smaller model sizes and faster inference speeds, making it particularly beneficial for resource-constrained environments or real-time applications. For instance, in edge computing scenarios where ML models are deployed on devices with limited computational resources, quantization can enable efficient inference without sacrificing accuracy.
Furthermore, hardware acceleration through the utilization of GPUs or TPUs can significantly enhance model performance by leveraging specialized hardware designed for parallel processing (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). GPUs, with their massive parallelism and high memory bandwidth, excel at accelerating matrix operations and convolutions, which are fundamental computations in many deep learning models. This acceleration can significantly reduce inference time and enable real-time processing of sensor data for timely irrigation decisions. TPUs, specifically designed for deep learning workloads, offer even greater performance and energy efficiency for specific model architectures. These hardware accelerators can drastically reduce inference time, enabling near real-time decision-making and enhancing the responsiveness of automated irrigation systems. For example, in a scenario where immediate response to changing weather conditions or soil moisture levels is critical, hardware acceleration can ensure that irrigation decisions are made and executed promptly.
In addition to model compression and hardware acceleration, distributed training techniques play a crucial role in optimizing the training process for large-scale ML models. Techniques such as Horovod and BytePS enable the distribution of training across multiple machines, effectively parallelizing the process and reducing training time (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). This is particularly beneficial for complex models with a large number of parameters or when dealing with large datasets. By leveraging distributed training, irrigation management systems can train more sophisticated models and improve their predictive capabilities, leading to more accurate and efficient irrigation decisions. For instance, a system that utilizes a deep learning model with millions of parameters can benefit from distributed training to reduce training time from days to hours, enabling faster model iteration and improvement.
Integrating the deployed ML models with other components of the automated irrigation management pipeline is essential for achieving a fully autonomous and cohesive system and addressing the need for seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system. Standardized protocols, such as MQTT and CoAP, provide lightweight and efficient communication channels for exchanging data between these components (Poojara et al., 2023; Jimenez et al., 2020a; Gour et al., 2023). MQTT, with its publish-subscribe architecture, enables real-time data streaming and event-driven communication, making it suitable for transmitting sensor data, control signals, and inference results (Raikar & M, 2023). This enables the ML model to receive real-time updates on soil moisture, weather conditions, and plant health, allowing for dynamic adjustments to irrigation schedules based on the latest data. CoAP, designed for constrained devices and low-power networks, offers a web-transfer protocol for resource-constrained environments, enabling efficient communication between sensors, actuators, and the ML models (Raikar & M, 2023). This is particularly relevant in situations where sensors or actuators have limited processing power or battery life, as CoAP minimizes communication overhead and energy consumption. Additionally, RESTful APIs provide a standardized interface for accessing and controlling the ML models, enabling seamless integration with other software components and facilitating system management and monitoring (Wang et al., 2022). This allows for easy integration with existing farm management systems or third-party applications, creating a unified platform for comprehensive irrigation management.4.4. Online Learning in the Cloud
The complexities of real-time data processing in irrigation management necessitate the exploration of advanced techniques to continuously learn and adapt to the dynamic nature of agricultural environments. Online learning algorithms offer a promising solution, enabling the continuous update and improvement of machine learning models based on incoming real-time data. This adaptability is crucial for addressing the challenges of changing environmental conditions, such as weather patterns and crop growth stages, and optimizing irrigation decision-making to enhance water usage efficiency and crop productivity.
Several online learning algorithms have demonstrated potential for real-time data processing and model adaptation in the context of irrigation management. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) facilitates the incremental update of model parameters with each new data point, allowing for efficient adaptation to changing data distributions (Bottou, 2010). This incremental learning process ensures that the model remains responsive to the latest conditions, minimizing the risk of outdated predictions and improving the accuracy of irrigation decisions. Passive-Aggressive algorithms, on the other hand, adjust model parameters only when a misclassification occurs, providing a computationally efficient approach for handling large data streams (Crammer et al., 2006). These algorithms offer a robust approach to handling noisy data, a common challenge in real-world sensor readings, by making small adjustments only when the model's prediction deviates significantly from the actual value (Fei et al., 2019). Online Random Forests extend the concept of random forests to the online setting, enabling the incremental construction and update of decision trees as new data arrives (Saffari et al., 2009). The continuous evolution of the ensemble ensures that the model remains relevant to the changing environment, capturing intricate relationships between variables and leading to more informed irrigation decisions.
Research in various domains highlights the importance of online learning for real-time data stream analytics. Snyder et al. (2020) explored the application of online learning techniques for identifying relevant tweets in real-time, improving situational awareness for first responders. The proposed interactive learning framework allows users to continuously label the relevance of incoming tweets, enabling the real-time refinement of the underlying machine learning model. This user-guided approach aligns well with the dynamic nature of irrigation management, where models need to continuously adjust to varying environmental conditions and crop water requirements. Similarly, research in the field of cyber-physical systems (CPS) underscores the need for online learning algorithms to effectively extract insights and knowledge from continuously generated data streams (Fei et al., 2019). These capabilities are crucial for enabling feedback loops between physical processes and cyber elements, facilitating the integration and optimization of CPS in irrigation management systems.
To implement online learning in cloud-based irrigation management systems, various architectures and frameworks can be considered. Apache Spark Streaming, Apache Flink, and AWS Kinesis provide scalable and fault-tolerant platforms for processing real-time data streams, allowing for the development of online learning pipelines that continuously ingest and analyze data to update machine learning models (Zaharia et al., 2012; Carbone et al., 2015; Amazon Web Services, 2023). These frameworks leverage serverless computing paradigms, automatically scaling resources based on the volume and velocity of incoming data, ensuring efficient resource utilization and responsiveness to fluctuations in demand (Fei et al., 2019).
Effectively managing the exploration-exploitation trade-off is crucial for optimizing online learning in irrigation management. Techniques such as Multi-armed bandits (Sutton & Barto, 2018), Bayesian optimization (Shahriari et al., 2016), and Reinforcement Learning (RL) (Sutton & Barto, 2018) can be employed to balance the allocation of resources between exploring new irrigation strategies and exploiting the current best-performing approaches. These techniques enable the identification of optimal irrigation policies, adapting to changing environmental conditions and maximizing long-term rewards.
In conclusion, online learning techniques, coupled with scalable cloud-based architectures, offer a powerful solution for real-time data processing and continuous adaptation in irrigation management systems. By leveraging algorithms like SGD, Passive-Aggressive, and Online Random Forests, along with stream processing frameworks like Apache Spark Streaming, Apache Flink, and AWS Kinesis, irrigation management systems can effectively handle the complexities of real-time data, optimize water usage, and enhance crop productivity in the face of dynamic environmental conditions.

Abstract While resilience is deﬁned differentially by social scientists and ecolo-
gists, sustainability is possible where resilient social and ecological systems meet
and interact, and sustainable resilient systems promote societal use of ecosystem
services supporting contemporary societal needs without risk to future generations.
Yet it is possible for seemingly appropriate and rational decisions from individuals,
and society at large, to be counter to long-term sustainable solutions. Historic rice
ﬁeld cultivation in the wetlands of the Carolinas and Florida provides an example
of various forms of resilience and sustainability within the theoretical framework of
alternate stable states, whereby a resilient system can exist in more than one state
and where stability is achieved when disruptive variables are not so disruptive as
to generate tipping points from one state to another. This contribution examines
the changing role and political as well as environmental impacts of rice agricul-
ture in the region with particular emphasis on the contingent processes of envi-
ronmental and cultural transformation that took place between the seventeenth and
twenty-ﬁrst centuries.

Deﬁning Resilience
The anthropogenic modiﬁcation of Earth and Earth systems has, in recent years,
garnered attention from a variety of academic disciplines resulting in increased
awareness and interest in resiliency across multiple system types that include ecolog-
ical and social systems. Generally, resilience is the amount of disturbance a system
canabsorbwithout changingstate(Gunderson2000, 426). However, resiliencecanbe
deﬁned differentially by various disciplines: social scientists deﬁne social resilience
as comprising three dimensions—coping capacity, adaptive capacity, and transfor-
mative capacity (Keck and Sakdapolrak 2013, 5–7). Ecologists measure ecological
resilience by the magnitude of disturbance that can be absorbed by a system before its
variables and processes controlling the system’s behavior are changed such that the
system redeﬁnes its structure or settles in an alternate stable state (Gunderson 2000,
426). Ecologists also identify systems designed with a single operating objective and
a global optimum where alternate states should be avoided as engineering resilience
(Gunderson 2000, 426).
There is potential for sustainability where resilient social and ecological systems
meet and shape one another through various interactions. Sustainable resilient
systemspromotesocietaluseofecosystemservicessupportingcontemporarysocietal
needs without risk to future generations (Adger and Hodbod 2013). It is possible for
seemingly appropriate and rational decisions from individuals, and society at large, to
be counter to long-term sustainable solutions, even to the point where the resiliency
of the support systems that promote such decisions is disrupted (Kahn 1966, 23, 24,
27). The consequences of known and unknown socio-ecological risks to the present
and the future are diminished where resilient systems support sustainability (Adger
and Hodbod 2013, 79–81). Risks that may be mitigated include changing climate,
natural disasters, and wholesale socio-political systems change (e.g., abolition of
slavery).
Alternate stable states theory suggests a resilient system can exist in more than one
state. A state is considered stable when the disruptive variables inﬂuencing it are not
so disruptive that it shifts state or regimes. The resiliency of a system determines how
large of a perturbation the system can experience without the system shifting states.
Stable state theory is commonly visualized with a cup-and-ball diagram (Fig. 1),
where the “cup” represents the system, and the ball represents the state of the system.
The parameters maintaining the system state are represented by the walls of the cup;
the position of the ball in the cup represents the state of the system. When the ball is
at the bottom of the cup (i.e., the basin of attraction) the system is most stable. The
steepness of the walls determines the return time of the system after disturbance,
whereas the width of the cup pertains to the system’s resilience. Negative feedback
mechanisms tend to push the system back towards the stable bottom of the cup after a
perturbation. For the system to change to an alternate state, the perturbation must be
large enough for the ball to breach the precipice of the cup and enter another stable
state. Once an alternative stable state has been entered it is unlikely that the previous
stable state can be reclaimed.

that control the system’s state are represented by the walls of the cup. In the ﬁgure presented there
is a transition era where the precipice of the original state (i.e., Era of “rice culture”) has been
breached and the system is gaining momentum towards transitioning to the contemporary era but
there are a variety of forces attempting to push the system’s state back into the stability of the era
of “rice culture”. We refer to this era as a transition era
Resilience on Lowcountry Wetlands and in Lowcountry Rice
Fields
The economic, cultural, and environmental signiﬁcance of southeastern rice is almost
completely obscured by that of King Cotton, the export crop that came to dominate
southern agriculture by the mid-1800s. Even still, the role of rice agriculture is almost
completely unknown to the American consciousness as the driving national force it
once was, one that created the wealthiest planters and largest slaveholders in British
North America before the American Revolution. South Carolina rice planters claimed
Nathaniel Heyward, the wealthiest slave holder with the largest slave holdings, as
one of their own until his death in 1851 (Heyward 1993, xi, liv, 3–6, 12–13, 18–19).
The value of rice to global society has been and continues to be immense.
Across time and space, Queen Rice can demonstrate how human labor and
wetlands can be harnessed for economic ends, and how such systems can be resilient
or collapse with political change such as that of the 13th Amendment of the US
Constitution. Wetlands are valuable natural resources that provide high biological
diversity. They ﬁlter and transform nutrients and pollutants and act to buffer the
impacts of human activities on downstream aquatic systems (Hook 1993, 2157,
2160). Wetlands have been transformed in West Africa’s Upper Guinea Coast since
c. 1500 CE (Fields-Black 2008, 135–160) and in North America since the 1720s to
grow rice as a staple and commodity crop. In North America, the modiﬁcation of
wetlands continued into the 1920s (Heyward 1993, x, xxii–xxx, xxxiii–xxxiv, liii–liv,
14, 33–34, 45, 48, 50, 54, 56, 60, 62, 63–65, 67–69, 74–75, 81–82, 90, 213–216, 39).
During this period, some 234,354 acres of wetlands in South Carolina were modiﬁed

Fig. 2 Historic rice ﬁelds of the coastal plains of the southeastern U.S.A. extend from southeastern
North Carolina to northeastern Florida. In green are the results of a mapping project using high
resolution LiDAR to identify the historic rice ﬁelds of South Carolina
for rice production (Hanks et al. 2021, 7) (Fig. 2). Historic rice ﬁelds provide an
interesting case study of the various forms of resilience and sustainability within the
theoretical framework of alternate stable states.
Wetland clearing, tree stump removal, land leveling, and construction of water
retention devices resulted in the ﬁrst foray in the coastal plains of southeastern North
Carolina to northeastern Florida, U.S.A. into the culture of rice as a staple crop
to be followed with its use as a commodity crop. Ecosystems over extensive areas
were substantially transformed by the rice economy and altered soils, vegetation, and
hydrologies present invaluable opportunities for habitat conservation, speciﬁcally for
economically important and migratory waterfowl. Queen Rice also provides impor-
tant insights into resilience, in that ongoing and ecological and human dynamics
produce new and invaluable stable states despite previous collapses.
The Queen Rice economy was entirely dependent on enslaved people to help
planters identify microenvironments where rice could be successfully cultivated and
perform the arduous labor of converting coastal plain marshes and forests to rice agri-
culture from the late 1600s to mid-1800s. Enslaved laborers levelled the primeval
forest, felling cypress trees with axes–trunks of the largest cypress trees measured
up to 12 ft in circumference–and deracinated the cypress knees with hand tools
(Harper 1998, 59). Enslaved laborers made the earth as “level as a billiard table”

with shovels, baskets, and planks of wood and moved 500,000 cubic feet of river
muck per mile on South Carolina’s Cooper River alone to construct the hydraulic irri-
gation system (Rosengarten 1998, 40; Ferguson 1992, 147). Then, enslaved laborers
cultivated, harvested, and processed the rice crops and maintained the hydraulic irri-
gation system. American and European slave traders imported an estimated 198,314
Africa captives into South Carolina and Georgia colonies between 1701 and 1858
(www.slavevoyages.com). It is likely that the majority of these enslaved people were
forced to labor in the swamps on Lowcounty South Carolina and Georgia rice plan-
tations. South Carolina rice planters and congressmen led the legislative lobby to
keep the trans-Atlantic slave trade open and legal. The Compromise of 1796 resulted
in the abolition of the trans-Atlantic slave trade in US colonies in 1808. The illegeal
slave trade continued into the Lowcountry. South Carolina and Georgia’s share of
slave importation equalled more than half (53%) of the entire number of African
captives imported into the US mainland. (www.slavevoyages.com). Dependence on
an unfree and unpaid labor system set up a social system and an economic system,
a plantation economy, which were not resilient.
The earliest rice culture was not resilient. It used low-lying, inland freshwater
environments, valley bottoms of cypress-hardwood streams, and wetlands at the
heads of creeks and rivers. Colonial naturalist Mark Catesby described the land
that planters converted as “impregnated by the washings from the higher lands”
over a period of years to become “deep soyl [sic]…a sandy loam of a dark brown
colour” (Catesby 1771, iii). Early planters adapted rice cultivation techniques to the
Lowcountry environment. Inland, freshwater swamp rice plantations depended on
the natural features of watersheds to better irrigate rice ﬁelds. By hand, enslaved
laborers cleared hardwood forests of cypress, tupelo, and sweet gum trees, exposing
soils with slow water permeability and high water-holding capacity into which rice
was sowed.
The ﬁelds were located on low-lying nearly level terrain with very slight
downward-sloping grades (0–2%) that allowed drainage of freshwater into the rice
ﬁelds. Locations of rice ﬁelds were chosen to take advantage of water from higher
elevations ﬂowing down into the ﬁelds from surface and groundwater sources (Smith
2019, 3–6, 7–8, 29–35, 38, 96–97, 109–112, 116–118, 120–121). Enslaved laborers
built clayey embankments that retained water in reservoirs and quarter-drains then
released it.
The 1700s saw demand and market share for rice from the Carolinas increase and
concurrently, the development of more effective technologies and infrastructures
for managing water. By 1710, rice had become South Carolina’s most successfully
cultivated staple crop and by the 1730s demand for rice exports was exploding.
Annual exports from Charleston harbor increased ﬁve-fold between 1720 to 1740,
from about 6 to 30 million pounds (Coclanis 1989, 83). Growth in the 1730s is partly
attributed to the relaxation of the British Navigation Acts, enabling Carolina planters
to export rice directly to Southern Europe on British ships.
Planters in the early eighteenth century were focused on economic growth. But,
with increased demand and market share, planters established greater management
control over the ﬂow of water into the rice ﬁelds by constructing a complex of
278
E. L. Fields-Black et al.
irrigation channels, trunks, and gates. Early trunks consisted of hollowed out tree
trunks with plugs on each end. The irrigation resembled technologies used in West
Africa’s rice-growing region (Carney 1996, 27; Doar 1970, 12). Planters further
mechanized water control systems with valves, rectangular boxes that were open to
incoming water on one end, and sliding gates to trap and release freshwater into the
rice ﬁelds. Simultaneously, the valves resembled technologies English farmers were
using to drain fens (Edelson 2006, 6, 34, 48, 73–74, 76, 197).
Despite technological improvements, inland rice cultivation presented serious
limits to the agricultural system’s potential for growth. Planters were limited by
the unidirectional ﬂow of stream and river water, and gestating rice was vulnerable
to both droughts and ﬂoods. Subtropical storm runoff readily breached the earthen
embankments and washed out inland rice ﬁelds. On the other hand, the burgeoning
rice export trade demanded more efﬁcient, reliable, and predictable irrigation systems
that would give planters more control over water.
South Carolina rice planter, Nathaniel Hayward’s, primary inheritance was an
inland rice ﬁelds on a tributary of the Broad River in Beaufort County, South Carolina
and tidal rice ﬁelds only partially reclaimed near the Combahee River. He made a
good faith effort planting the inland rice ﬁelds, which took advantage of water on
higher elevations in the marsh where evergreen loblolly pine and oak trees grew in
dry, sandy, clay soils without altering the environment. Nathaniel Heyward planted
his inland rice ﬁelds for only one season. When the rice was still in the ﬁelds and
almost ready to be harvested, a “freshet” destroyed the entire crop. Legend has it that
he drove out to his inland rice ﬁeld in his buggy the next morning after the storm
to survey the damage. His ﬁne rice crop was submerged. Heyward took one look
at the water covering it, got back in the buggy, and never went back to or planted
the inland rice ﬁeld again. From this point, he focused on managing his brothers’
inheritances, draining the swamps on his partially reclaimed tidal ride ﬁelds and his
brothers’ larger tidal rice ﬁelds, and subsequently acquiring and building his own
empire, 17 “gold mines,” tidal rice ﬁelds on the Combahee River in South Carolina’s
Colleton County (Heyward 1993, 11–12, 14, 50, 65–67).
Inland rice culture provided means to store water in reserve systems as a way to
provide some mitigation against unpredictable water supply, which was the primary
threat to a successful crop (Smith 2019, 3, 9, 81–82, 88, 99, 195; Coclanis 1989,
78–83). There remained some uncertainty for successful crop production depending
on the severity of the drought where upstream reserves could not store enough water
to supply the downstream rice ﬁeld. It was not until the development of the tidal ﬁeld
system that large scale and consistent rice crops could be produced and shipped to
market.UnlikeNathanielHeyward,notallriceplantersgaveupinlandricecultivation
entirely. Middling planters who were not uber-wealthy like the Heywards, continued
to grow inland rice primarily for subsistence. After the collapse of the Queen Rice
economy in the early twentieth century, African American farmers on heirs’ property,
property owned by the descendants of landowners who died intestate, well into the
twentieth century (Heyward 1993, xiii–xiv; Hilliard 1975, 57–58; Merrens 1972,
187, 192; Smith 2019, 3, 9, 81–82, 88, 99, 195; Vernon 1993, 248, n.9, 274 n.7).

Inland swamp rice production was not perfect. It did not allow planters to control
water and often led to too much water, in torrential deluges called freshets, or too
little water in the rice ﬁelds. Perfecting water control would require more technology,
more labor, even more knowledge of the coastal wetlands, and much more capital
to reclaim the swamps and establish tidal rice production. It would take another few
decades for all of these factors to come together in the mid-eighteenth century.
Tidal rice plantations were based on a simple principle of water control; they
used the fresh water in river estuaries, which rose and fell with the tides, to ﬂood
rice ﬁelds. Tidal rice ﬁelds are located in an inland zone that is close enough to
the coast to experience tidal ﬂuctuations but far enough upstream to be freshwater.
This geographic location allowed them to take advantage of the predictable tidal
ﬂuctuations and the associated freshwater wedge, thereby allowing the management
of freshwater into and out of the ﬁelds.
Tidal rice plantations used water-control structures to inundate ﬁelds with the
freshwater of estuaries that ﬂoated on top of the salt water and that rose and fell
with the tides. With predictable environmental conditions (i.e., predictable supply of
freshwater) ensured, the physical structure of the former wetlands as tidal rice ﬁelds
became engineered and managed. As the process of rice culture in tidal ﬁelds was
ﬁne tuned and overall yield per acre increased, the tidal ﬁelds system was focused on
a singularly objective, the production of rice for its market value. The immensity of
the change to the structure and function of the wetlands across such a large geography
resulted in a state shift from natural wetlands to engineered and managed wetlands,
or rice ﬁelds. This combination made for the only naturally irrigated soils in the US.
When management control was established over the hydrology of tidal wetlands, the
area of rice cultivation greatly expanded.
Planters and enslaved laborers selected level land along rivers with tidal estuaries,
impacted by the tides, accessing freshwater on either side. Planters and enslaved
laborers converted level ﬂoodplains and swamplands along tidal rivers to rice ﬁelds,
managing both fresh- and saltwater. Canals with ﬂoodgates were even constructed
to channel freshwater from tidal estuaries to remote rice ﬁelds.
Slave labor was used throughout the time where the methodology of growing rice
in the southern coastal plains of the United States was ﬁne-tuned and increasingly
focused on the tidal rice system. This societal stable state allowed forced and enslaved
labor to transform a vast geography of wetlands across these coastal plains (more
than 234, 354 acres in South Carolina, USA alone) (Hanks et. al. 2021, 7). Enslaved
laborers converted tidal swamps to rice ﬁelds with water control infrastructures by
building ditches and embankments around an entire ﬂoodplain. Next, they cleared,
burned, and removed trees and stumps. Embankments that surrounded ﬁelds had
wooden “trunks” installed for ﬂooding and drainage. Trunks passed through the
dikes and allowed movement between rice ﬁelds or between a tidal rice ﬁeld and
the tidal river. Initially, cypress trunks were used after being hollowed from top to
bottom and installing a large plug to control water ﬂow. Trunks eventually evolved
into sophisticated wooden structures with gates at each end that opened and shut
depending on the tide. Individual ﬁelds had cross ditches and channels excavated
and check banks installed for highly precise water level control (Fig. 3). In the ﬁnal
stage, enslaved laborers planted rice on the ﬂoodplains.

Fig. 3 Comparison and description of inland (a) and tidal rice ﬁeld (b) morphology. Inland ﬁelds
are linear, gravity fed wetlands. Widths of these wetlands can range from over 1000’ wide to just
100’ wide. Inland ﬁelds are bordered by uplands. Tidal ﬁelds were constructed in ﬂoodplain areas
between sections of tidal, freshwater rivers and uplands. Inland ﬁelds tend to be narrow and long
which result in smaller acreage impoundments. Tidal ﬁelds are not as constrained by adjacent
uplands and individual impoundments on the average are larger acreages than those in inland rice
ﬁelds
Conversion of a tidal swamp was a “great undertaking,” one considerably more
difﬁcult than that of the inland swamps. It required signiﬁcant engineering knowledge
andknowledgeofthenaturallandscape,aswellasintensivecapitalandenslavedlabor
inputs over many years. In addition to clearing and leveling the land, constructing
the hydraulic irrigation system, enslaved laborers maintained the irrigation system
against the threat of breaks in the embankments and the rush of water. Because of
the capital, labor, and time demands of tidal rice culture, only wealthy planters with
multiple investments like Nathaniel Heyward, not small farmers, could undertake
swamp reclamation. Then, they reinvested proﬁts from one tidal rice plantation into
acquiring more labor and reclaiming more tidal lands. The intensiﬁcation of capital
in the new American economy was vital to tidal rice culture (Heyward 1993, 18). By
the mid-eighteenth century, tidal rice culture was extensive. By 1770, rice exports
exceeded 60 million pounds per year (Fig. 1), largely due to tidal rice cultivation
(Coclanis 1989, 83).
The system of slave labor became entangled with the environmental system of
engineered and managed rice ﬁelds so intensively that the environmental system of
engineered and managed rice ﬁelds could not exist were it not for the social system.
With the environmental system of rice production now being stable and consistent
(i.e., in an alternate stable state) across such a large geography and the singular focus
of the rice ﬁelds being to produce marketable rice, slave labor became an integral cog
in the socio-environmental system of rice culture in the southeastern United States.
In other words, to maintain the stability of the environmental system (i.e., rice ﬁelds)
required the stability of the social system where slave labor was foundational.

The full tragedy of Queen Rice is that African–Americans were at high risk of
disease and survival rates were notably low in New World rice plantations. Though
yields of tidal rice were incredibly productive and ﬁnancially lucrative and though
enslaved laborers contributed labor as well as critical skills, tidal rice culture came
at a high cost for enslaved laborers. The saturated and inundated environments of the
inland and tidal rice ﬁelds were extremely unhealthy environments. Rice plantations
in the South Carolina and Georgia lowcountry had among the highest death rates
among enslaved children and adults in the US, and second only to sugar plantations
in the entire New World (Forster and Smith 2011, 909, 923). Whereas death rates
for slaves on cotton and tobacco plantations dropped to approximately 33% by the
1780s, double the number, approximately two-thirds, of enslaved people still died on
lowcountry rice plantations up until the Civil War. Along the Savannah River, 90%
of children enslaved on rice plantations died before 15 years of age. In the winter of
1839 when most of the children died on Pierce Butler’s Butler Island rice plantation
on the Altamaha River near Darien, GA, the mother of a child who recently died
described the plight of many women enslaved on Lowcountry rice plantations saying
over and over again to Fannie Kemble, Butler’s English wife: “I’ve lost a many; they
all goes so” (Dusinberre 1996, 2–3, 49–51, 55–56, 58, 61, 74, 80–81, 84, 103, 121,
188, 199, 237–238, 240–241, 245, 325, 412–413, 415–416; Kemble 1984, 130).
The tight coupling of the social and environmental systems in the production of
rice as a commodity crop through the engineered tidal ﬁeld system operated within an
engineering resilience framework. Production of rice for market value was the single
objective of the tidal rice ﬁeld system and any alternate state, for either the environ-
mental or social system, was potentially not acknowledged but certainly to be avoided
at all costs. Maintaining the system in an engineering resilient framework required
constant input of energy which was provided by slave labor. Southern planters were
unable to assess potential risks to the coupled socio-environmental system they had
developed and fostered because they were operating in an engineering resiliency
state-of-mind, where no other potential alternate stable states were envisaged. In this
framework, the environmental stability of the tidal rice ﬁelds was a requisite that had
to be maintained to produce rice and the only way this was possible was through
slave labor.
The external forces that tested the resilience of the environmental system (i.e.,
engineered and managed tidal rice ﬁelds) still existed in both chronic (e.g., the erosion
of dikes along riverbanks) and episodic (e.g., hurricanes) but this was overcome with
the immense human power of forced free labor provided by a social system that
enabled slave labor. Any threats to the social system (i.e., slavery) was quashed by
the system itself. That is until the American Civil War put an end to slavery. At this
point, both environmental and social systems underwent interlinked perturbations
that allowed both to realize various trajectories previously unacknowledged and
likely beyond contemporaneous comprehension. People who were once enslaved
were now “free” and those who enslaved them now had to envision new ways to
manage their engineered rice ﬁelds without slave labor. This resulted in a period
after the American Civil War where planters attempted to continue to produce and
manage rice as a commodity crop within the engineered rice ﬁelds up until the
282
E. L. Fields-Black et al.
last commercial rice crop in South Carolina was produced by ss. In Fig. 1 this is
represented by the small (and temporary) alternate stable state (termed “transition
era”), which was fragile at best, requiring only small perturbations to push the system
into a completely different stable state. These perturbations came in the form of
several hurricanes and disruptions in market supply chains that affected planters in
the southeastern coastal plains.
This transition era reﬂects the point made in Haldon et al. (2020, 1) that systems
seldom collapse in the dramatic fashion so often popularized in modern culture. The
rice culture that began in the 1670s and saw its ultimate demise beginning just prior
to the American Civil War did not change the social nor the environmental systems
in rapid fashion. Still today American society struggles with racism, some 155 years
after the end of the American Civil War. The environmental system continues to
change and may require more time to reach the stable bottom of the cup than that of
the social system.
The postbellum social system disrupted the production of rice as a commodity
crop in the southeastern U.S. due to the abolishment of slavery, but it also affected
the engineered rice ﬁelds where, after some time, it was no longer seen as a tenable
option to manage for rice production. These managed wetlands now experienced
various ecological trajectories. While some previously managed ﬁelds were unman-
aged and allowed to “re-wild,” still others were managed for another objective–
waterfowl hunting. The utilization of rice ﬁelds for waterfowl hunting beginning
in the 1910 and 1920s has continued to evolve as a conservation ethic has perco-
lated through this region. In recent years management of engineered tidal rice ﬁelds
has become more diverse in the set of objectives that now includes, along with
waterfowl, ecosystem services such as wildlife habitat (e.g., black rail, wood storks,
roseate spoonbill, American alligator, etc.). These “new” objectives and their socio-
environmental stable states are represented by the third cup in Fig. 1 and have yet to
be fully established.
Resilience, Climate Change, and the 21st Century Rice Field
Infrastructure
Given that the rice ﬁelds in South Carolina have signiﬁcant historical, cultural and
ecological signiﬁcance, it is prudent to consider the permanence of these man made
systems. Over the course of rice history in South Carolina, there have been several
shifts in locations and objectives of rice ﬁelds. Initially the potential to reap ﬁnancial
proﬁts started the rice economy in South Carolina and planters developed and used
the inland ﬁeld system. Ultimately tidal rice ﬁelds provided a ﬁnancially successful
alternative to inland ﬁelds and planters shifted their development and management in
this area. These tidal ﬁelds (and inland ﬁelds to a lesser degree) transitioned from a
ﬁnancial to an ecological objective with the end of rice as a commodity crop and the
rise of sporting pursuits on the rice plantations. From the early twentieth century this
Resilience of Coupled Socio-Ecological Systems: Historic Rice Fields …
283
ecological objective has persisted and become more diverse with recognition that the
management of these tidal and inland rice ﬁelds beneﬁts waterfowl and many other
non-game species like bald eagles, wood storks, black rails, etc.
There is increasing awareness by the owners and managers of the rice ﬁelds that
the permanence of the existing system is being inﬂuenced negatively. Federal, state,
and private owners of rice ﬁelds are faced with changing forces on this infrastruc-
ture. Decision making about how, when and how much to invest in these man-made
systems is complex and has been ongoing since their creation.
Rice ﬁelds are composed of raised dikes that prevent water from entering or
exiting a particular area where rice was grown and now is managed for wildlife
habitat (Fig. 3). Canals were excavated to enable water ﬂow throughout the system.
Water control structures were placed in dikes to permit water retention or dewatering
in these rice ﬁelds. Other than the water control structures (which are typically
wooden), this system is constructed from onsite mud and soil. The properties of this
mud and soil have inﬂuenced the maintenance regimes of the earthen infrastructure
from the very inception of rice ﬁeld construction in the early eighteenth century. As
an example, some plantations may have been established along sections of rivers
where the local material had a high sand content. Other rice ﬁelds were established
along particular rivers where the available soil material was higher in loam or clay.
When building dikes that stand 4–6’ above the wetland grade, soils with higher clay
content are able to persist longer with the normal erosion forces of rain, travel across
the dikes, etc. These constant erosion forces require these dikes to have material
placed back on top and the interim period between these efforts can vary from 5 to
10 years for areas of sand versus 10–15 years for areas of material with higher clay
content.
Rice planters initially and wildlife habitat managers today have dealt with this
constant degradation of the built rice ﬁeld system. Retopping dikes, installing new
water control structures, excavating canals for improved water circulation were all
acts that have been required from the very beginning of rice culture and were incor-
porated into the mental calculus of determining whether it was worth the ﬁnancial
investment to perform these remedial acts. Maintenance and repair issues have always
been a part of the rice ﬁeld landscape and until recent decades were costs nearly all
were willing to bear to maintain the system.
The costs and efforts, though, of maintaining rice ﬁelds, especially tidal ones,
has become more costly and more frequent in recent decades. Environmental forces
that have been inﬂuenced by climate change are causing increased degradation and
loss of the rice ﬁeld infrastructure. These forces include increases in tidal amplitude
as driven by sea level rise and increase in the frequency of tropical storm events as
a result of climate change. We discuss each of these factors below and how they
negatively impact rice ﬁeld infrastructure.
Tidal rice ﬁelds were placed along the tidal rivers in creeks to take advantage
of the tidal, freshwater. Dikes and water control structures allowed the intentional
ﬂooding and dewatering of the rice ﬁelds depending on different times of the rice
growing season. Since the transition to management of wildlife habitat, the inten-
tional ﬂooding and dewatering of the tidal rice ﬁelds enables management for native
284
E. L. Fields-Black et al.
plant communities (e.g., widgeongrass in brackish and smartweed and panic grasses
in freshwater rice ﬁelds) that do not develop under normal tidal regimes in free tidal
ﬂow marshes.
At a mechanistic level, tidal ﬁelds worked because the dike heights were built to a
grade above mean high water. The bed of the rice ﬁeld (i.e., the broad acreage where
rice initially and not native plants were and are grown) was at a level above mean
low water (Fig. 4). This enabled full dewatering of the rice ﬁeld because as the tidal
river reached low tide, i.e. below the bed level, water from the tidal rice ﬁeld passed
through water control structures from the rice ﬁeld and into the free tidal ﬂow water
bodies.
Sea level rise impacts are most visible in coastal communities. The impacts of
more frequent ﬂooding on tourist and beach communities are commonly reported
in the media (Tibbetts and Mooney 2018; Cappucci 2020). Additionally, sea level
rise also inﬂuences tidal amplitude inland along tidal rivers. In South Carolina, these
river systems are typiﬁed by the Combahee, Ashepoo, Edisto and Santee Rivers.
Coastal South Carolina has seen a signiﬁcant increase in tide levels. Since 1950,
tidal waters have increased 10 inches in Charleston, which is central along the coast
to rice growing areas of SC (Anonymous 2019, 6). Additionally, this increase appears
to be increasing to a point where tidal increases of 1 inch every 2 years is anticipated.
These dramatic statistics within the tidal rice ﬁeld landscape are forcing
landowners to think of how increasing mean high water marks interact with the grade
of perimeter dikes. Indeed, increasing numbers of spring tides, i.e. the strongest tide
of the lunar cycle, are now overtopping these perimeter dikes. Efforts to raise them

during the era of rice ﬁeld development (i.e., late 1700s until mid 1800s). MLW level is at a point
below the rice ﬁeld bed such that water could easily pass from the tidal rice ﬁeld into the tidal
rivers. Sea level rise in the late twentieth and current twenty-ﬁrst century have shifted this tidal
amplitude up such that MLW levels are just below or at bed level and thereby making it difﬁcult to

are ongoing on rice plantations. In fact, because of the increasing mean high water,
efforts to raise dike levels over the last decade are ongoing in all areas of tidal rice
ﬁelds across South Carolina.
However, there is another more difﬁcult dynamic associated with the increased
tidal amplitude. Increasingly managers of tidal rice ﬁelds have difﬁculty fully dewa-
tering the ﬁelds during low tide periods because the mean low water mark has also
increased over time. Thus, the time and potential of water to pass from the tidal rice
ﬁeld and into the tidal river is limited. Because these tidal ﬁelds are managed for
wildlife habitat and because many of the native plants require periods of drying to the
bed, the management focus for wildlife is becoming more difﬁcult. Some plantations
have installed mechanical pumping stations to ameliorate the impact of increasing
mean low water marks, but this cost is additive to the cost of dike maintenance and
retopping.
Climatechangehas alsoimpactedthefrequencyof tropical stormevents (Marsooli
et al. 2019, 5). Coastal South Carolina has seen these impacts recently with nine
tropical storms events impacting coastal South Carolina since 2016 (Mizzell et al.
2020, 12). Luckily, there is a trend for the increased tropical storm events to be
storms with less intensity than in the past; however, these events lead to excessive
ﬂooding from rainfall and tidal surge. Both sources of excess water in tidal rivers
cause excessive dike erosion, dike breaching, and loss of water control structures. In
recent years, some plantations have performed these dike repairs between hurricane
seasons only to be forced into the same repair the next year caused by another storm.
Tidal rice ﬁelds are more susceptible to these impacts than inland ﬁelds for two
reasons. First, tidal ﬁelds are directly adjacent to tidal rivers and creeks. Therefore
they are immediately impacted by increases in tidal amplitude and storm surge as a
result of tropical storm events. In contrast, inland ﬁelds are insulated by geography
fromtheseimpacts;however,intenseraineventscancauseexcessiveﬂoodingthrough
the system, which degrades dikes and water control structures. In general, the cost
of maintenance of tidal ﬁelds versus inland ﬁelds is 1.5–2 times higher (per acre
of managed wetland). One complicating factor though is that more tidal ﬁelds than
inland ﬁelds are still actively maintained and managed for wildlife habitat.
There are few absolutes when dealing with environmental forces. One is that
man is rarely successful in engineering solutions that will completely ameliorate the
impacts on an anthropogenic landscape. So why then do owners and managers of
tidal rice ﬁelds continue to repair and maintain these systems in the face of increasing
pressures? What are the alternatives to the tidal rice ﬁeld system for wildlife habitat
management? What are the societal forces that would entrain owners and managers
to continue to repair tidal rice ﬁelds versus move back to inland ﬁelds where restoring
dikes, canals, and water control structures is easier and less costly per acre? All of
these questions are being considered informally across the coast of South Carolina.
Historically, real estate values have been the motivators for persistence in main-
taining and repairing tidal ﬁelds through the recent impacts of increases in tidal
amplitude and storm frequency. Tidal rice ﬁelds, when well managed for wildlife,
can be valued at $8000 to $10,000 per acre. These values are signiﬁcant when consid-
ering some tidal ﬁelds are hundreds of acres. The value of tidal ﬁelds where the dikes
286
E. L. Fields-Black et al.
not intact and management not possible would diminish to approximately $250 per
acre. Furthermore, the overall real estate of many of these plantations exists because
of the presence of functional tidal rice ﬁelds on the property. Would land owners
be willing to pay these prices if the tidal ﬁelds were not functional (i.e., dikes are
breached, water control structures are not present)?
The attractiveness of the habitat to wildlife itself must also be considered in the
question of tidal versus inland rice ﬁelds. In general, many water birds (waterfowl
and other species) typically do not use the area of habitat in close proximity to the
dike infrastructure. There is a band that surrounds these dikes where the habitat may
be suitable, but wildlife do not use it with as great a frequency as the interior of these
wetland units. This dynamic has not received much research, but it is hypothesized
that water birds avoid dikes due to the disturbance of travel across the dikes.
Many acres are still accessible to water birds in a squarish-conﬁguration of
hundreds of acres of tidal rice ﬁelds. This is in contrast to inland ﬁelds that tend to be
narrow and long. Might many inland ﬁelds be too narrow to allow full habitat utiliza-
tion by wildlife without the hypothesized perimeter disturbance effect? Research on
this has not been conducted but would be useful in better understanding how transi-
tioning ﬁnancial and logistical resources away from tidal and into inland ﬁelds might
succeed.
Conclusion
Change is certain, whether it be social or ecological and often the two co-mingle and
affect one another. Unlike the white rice ﬁeld planters of the antebellum southern
U.S., who were unable to envisage any other stable state, contemporary society must
attempt to project future changes and evaluate mitigating solutions to possible risks.
Historic rice ﬁelds, as a social-environmental system, are facing multiple changes
due to climate change. As such, they are a prime case for evaluating society’s ability
to consider alternative scenarios where current social and environmental functions
may change but large scale changes, or even functional loss, may be ameliorated. In
this light, many stakeholder groups who are part invested in the socio-environmental
system of historic rice ﬁelds are confronted with deciding how and if they should deal
with increased sea levels and tropical storm activity. Understanding the magnitude
of impacts and the nature of the resource lost to climate change is a wise ﬁrst step in
evaluating the type of mitigating response.
In the case of rice ﬁelds, we know their historical signiﬁcance, their place in the
cultural fabric of coastal South Carolina, and their importance as valuable wildlife
habitat. How can these components of historic rice ﬁelds, or potentially a subset
of these components, be maintained given the impending threats? Several questions
come to mind: (1) What, of the socio-environmental attributes of the rice ﬁelds,
should be the focus of conservation efforts?, (2) What are the possible implications
of conserving one attribute while forgoing conserving another (i.e., what does a new
alternate stable state look like?), (3) Who decides what attribute(s) to conserve?, (4)

287
What effect will possible changes in the environmental system have on the social
system and vice-versa?, (5) What potential means are available to achieve conserva-
tion of the decided upon attributes to be conserved? These are not easy questions to
answer given the complexity of either the social or environmental systems as sepa-
rate entities, let alone when attempting to consider them as a single co-mingled and
interacting system.
As a hypothetical example, it may be possible to shift the ecological function of
the threatened tidal ﬁelds (due to sea level rise and increased tropical storm activity)
to inland ﬁelds. In this example, inland ﬁelds could be cleared of timber, tree trunks
removed, the land leveled, and water retention and control structures and devices
installed to reclaim the forested land to its former rice ﬁeld structure. As the struc-
ture of tidal ﬁelds changes and presumably functional loss occurs, the hope would
be for these reclaimed inland ﬁelds to take on the structure and function of tidal rice
ﬁelds. If this were to be successful, it would increase the resilience of the ecological
system; however, there are likely cascading effects to the social system that must be
considered. The loss of structure and function of the tidal ﬁelds, where the primary
focus is on waterfowl hunting and their contemporary maintenance is provided by a
relatively small group of landowners, will likely result in changes in the structure of
monetary support for conservation efforts in the region. In other words, the structure
and function of today’s tidal ﬁelds and the resulting large scale conservation activi-
ties are primarily maintained by a small group of landowners. Without the available
environmental structure to support waterfowl hunting, these landowners may forgo
ﬁnancial support for conservation across the region. Shifting the ecological struc-
ture and function of the tidal ﬁelds to the reclaimed inland ﬁelds will result in a
different spatial arrangement and potentially different land ownership of these land-
scape features. The owners of these newly reclaimed rice ﬁelds may have a different
conservation ethic than the owners of the “lost” tidal ﬁelds. What might this mean
for the ecological structure and function? How might this impact the societal system
within the region?
With inevitable change to both environmental and societal systems, some of which
is foreseeable while others may not be, society should consider what the value of the
various attributes of any given social-environmental system are, what maintains the
system’s structure and function, what are the possible threats, however likely, to the
various attributes of the system, and what the structure and function of alternate stable
states might be. Such efforts should provide various scenarios where the resilience
of socio-environmental systems is increased. In doing so, society will hopefully be
able to promote wise use of environmental resources that meet the needs of both
contemporary and future societies.

  Explanation: Sociohydrology is a scientific discipline that studies the interactions between water and human systems. It is an interdisciplinary field that draws on the social and natural sciences to understand how water resources are used, managed, and affected by human activity.

The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a set of 17 goals that were adopted by all United Nations member states in 2015. The SDGs cover a wide range of issues, including poverty, hunger, health, education, gender equality, and climate change. Many of the SDGs are directly or indirectly related to water, and sociohydrology can play a key role in helping to achieve these goals.

For example, sociohydrology can help to:

* Understand the social and environmental impacts of water scarcity and pollution
* Develop more sustainable water management practices
* Improve access to safe water and sanitation
* Reduce the risk of water-related disasters
* Promote water conservation and efficiency

Sociohydrology is a relatively new field, but it has already made significant contributions to our understanding of water-human interactions. As the world faces increasingly complex water challenges, sociohydrology will become increasingly important in helping us to find sustainable solutions.

Meeting the SDGs for water requires an integrated approach to managing and allocating water resources, by involving all actors and stakeholders, and considering how water resources link different sectors of society. To date, water management practice is dominated by technocratic, scenario-based approaches that may work well in the short term but can result in unintended consequences in the long term due to limited accounting of dynamic feedbacks between the natural, technical, and social dimensions of human-water systems. The discipline of sociohydrology has an important role to play in informing policy by developing a generalizable understanding of phenomena that arise from interactions between water and human systems. To explain these phenomena, sociohydrology must address several scientific challenges to strengthen the field and broaden its scope. These include engagement with social scientists to accommodate social heterogeneity, power relations, trust, cultural beliefs, and cognitive biases, which strongly influence the way in which people alter, and adapt to, changing hydrological regimes. It also requires development of new methods to formulate and test alternative hypotheses for the explanation of emergent phenomena generated by feedbacks between water and society. Advancing sociohydrology in these ways therefore represents a major contribution toward meeting the targets set by the SDGs, the societal grand challenge of our time. Key Points The crises that humanity faces over access to a clean water supply are increasingly connected and are growing in complexity Sociohydrology researchers must address several scientific challenges to strengthen basic knowledge and broaden the range of solvable problems Advances in sociohydrology research are progress toward meeting the targets defined by the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals Plain Language Summary Water crises that humanity faces are increasingly connected and are growing in complexity. As such, they require a more integrated approach in managing water resources,which involves all actors and stakeholders and considers how water resources link different sectors of society. Yet, water management practice is still dominated by technocratic approaches, which emphasize technical solutions. While these approaches may work in the short-term, they often result in unintended consequences in the long-term. Sociohydrology is developing a generalizable understanding of the interactions and feedbacks between natural,technical and social processes, which can improve water management practice. As such, advancing sociohydrology can contribute to address the global water crises and meet the water-related targets defined by the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. 1 Introduction: Water Crises, SDGs, and SocioHydrology In the Anthropocene era, increasing attention is given in hydrologic science and water management to notions of nonstationarity (e.g., stationarity is dead; Milly et al., 2008) and change (e.g., hydrology for a changing world; Wagener et al., 2010). Yet, in the context of human influences on climate and hydrology, neither nonstationarity nor change is new. As early as 2,500 years ago, the pre-Socratic Greek philosopher Heraclitus (circa 535–475 BCE) gained prominence for his emphasis on change as the fundamental essence of the universe. To express the concept that nothing is permanent except change, Heraclitus metaphorically referred to the change in the symbiotic relationship between water and people using the words No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it's not the same river and he's not the same man. The prescient insight of Heraclitus can equally well serve as a metaphor for many of the water-related issues humanity is currently facing worldwide. Millions of people around the world are affected by water crises manifesting at different scales, such as increasing drought severity and flood risk, groundwater depletion, ecological degradation, poor sanitation, water pollution, and its impact on human health (Srinivasan et al., 2012). A survey among water experts was recently carried out by the International Association of Hydrological Sciences (IAHS) to identify global hot spots of water crises (Figure 1). The results of the survey highlighted that most water crises are understood by experts as the result of lack of understanding, or neglect, of wider, economic, and socio-cultural perspectives (by scientists, policy makers, and water resource managers). This supports the case that the global water crisis is a governance crisis and thus political, economic, and cultural in nature (Castro, 2007). Figure 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Global hot spots of water crises identified by the IAHS Panta Rhei survey across water scientists and experts. The figure shows the social, technical, and hydrological factors identified by the respondents as main drivers of the six types of water crises around the world. IAHS = International Association of Hydrological Sciences. In the spirit of Heraclitus, therefore, the water crises can be deemed the intended and/or unintended consequences of long-term changes (i.e., slow evolution) of social norms and values (or, more broadly, culture), ideology or political systems, which are not typically anticipated or accounted for in coping with water-related issues. It is for this reason, and inspired by Heraclitus himself, that the global, decadal (2013–2022) initiative of the IAHS was titled Panta Rhei-Everything Flows (McMillan et al., 2016; Montanari et al., 2013) and focuses on change in both hydrology and society. Sociohydrology engages with these principles (Sivapalan et al., 2012, 2014), by examining the outcomes of water management and governance processes, that is, both successes and failures, themselves as subjects of scientific study. Sociohydrology studies the two-way feedbacks between human and water systems that result in a wide range of phenomena that arise in different places around the world and in different contexts (Di Baldassarre et al., 2015; Gober & Wheater, 2015; Pande & Savenije, 2016; Sivapalan & Blöschl, 2015; Srinivasan, 2015; Srinivasan et al., 2012; Troy, Pavao-Zuckerman, & Evans, 2015). Work in sociohydrology has built upon a long history of work in three related fields. The first (1) is water resources systems (WRS) analysis that started with the Harvard Water Program in the 1960s (Brown et al., 2015; Kasprzyk et al., 2018) where the focus has mainly been on decision support by following a normative (optimization) route. The second (2) is integrated water resources management (IWRM), which was introduced in the 1990s and was more geared to actual implementation (Global Water Partnership, 2009) by (i) involving integration across the entire hydrological cycle; (ii) accommodating different water users and including engineering, economic, social, ecological, and legal aspects; while (iii) accounting for multiple spatial scales, such as upstream/downstream perspectives. The third (3) is the more recent development of interdisciplinary frameworks exploring the mutual shaping of society and nature (including water), such as social-ecological systems, coupled human-nature systems, and complex systems science (e.g., Adger, 2006; Cosens et al., 2018; Folke, 2006, 2010; Folke et al., 2010; Gohari et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2007; Loucks, 2015; Ostrom, 2009; Walker et al., 2004; Werner & McNamara, 2007). While building on these fields, sociohydrology is different from them. WRS (1) analysis is focused on optimization. The goal is to combine hydrology and economics to design and operate optimal infrastructure projects. In contrast, the focus of sociohydrology is on understanding why certain water management outcomes arise rather than proposing actual management solutions. Similarly, IWRM (2) prescribes how to manage water resources in specific contexts, while sociohydrology analyzes actual water management processes and outcomes to develop generalizable understanding. Unlike social-ecological systems and coupled human-nature systems (3), sociohydrology has a more explicit focus on water, and on the specifics of the hydrologic cycle in space and time (Konar et al., 2018), including the role of water infrastructure (Di Baldassarre, Kemerink, et al., 2014; Di Baldassarre, Kreibich, et al., 2018). Over the past 6 years, sociohydrology has pursued understanding of several classes of emergent phenomena, which are actual outcomes, paradoxical dynamics, or unintended consequences that arise from water management in the context of human-flood, human-drought, and human-environment interactions (Pande & Sivapalan, 2017; Sivapalan & Blöschl, 2015). This paper argues that the development of generalized understanding of socio-hydrological phenomena has an important role to play in informing policy processes and in assisting communities, governments, civil society organizations, and private actors as they mobilize to meet the United Nations Agenda 2030 and its Sustainable Development Goals, hereafter SDGs (United Nations, UN, 2015). The SDGs represent an ambitious blueprint to achieve a sustainable future for humanity, and address global challenges related to, among others, poverty, inequality, climate change, environmental degradation, and water (Death & Gabay, 2015; Fukuda-Parr, 2016). Achieving the SDGs is urgent, and 193 nations have committed to meet the targets set by the United Nations by 2030. The SDG 6, ensuring availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all is probably the greatest challenge we face in water resources management (UN Water, 2018). However, water plays a key role in several of the other SDGs as well and, therefore, water management must account for these multiple interrelated objectives (either in synergy or in conflict), not just focusing on clean water and sanitation. SDG 6 (and other related SDGs) is strongly committed to the IWRM paradigm (UN Water, 2016). This, it is argued, requires governments to consider how water resources link different parts of society and how decisions in one sector may affect water users in other sectors, as well as to adopt a participatory and inclusive approach by involving all actors and stakeholders, from all levels, who use and potentially pollute water, so that it is managed equitably and sustainably. (UN Water, 2018). Meeting the UN SDGs is, however, not straightforward. The targets set by the different SDGs are interrelated (UN Water, 2018), and they are sometimes fuzzy, contradictory, or challenging to implement (Sultana, 2018). For example, efforts to achieve the targets for clean water and sanitation can have unintended consequences on food and energy security and can contribute to environmental degradation. In the backdrop of these challenges, much of the current water management practice is still grounded on a strong techno-managerial culture, focused more on technocratic approaches than on addressing the socio-political and cultural dimensions underlying water crises, and the uneven distribution of costs and benefits (Hussein et al., 2018; Weststrate et al., 2018). Also, IWRM typically uses a scenario-based approach to account for human-water interactions (Savenije & Van der Zaag, 2008), which can work in the short term but in the long term can result in unintended consequences of only partially accounting for the coevolutionary dynamics of coupled human-water systems (Di Baldassarre, Kooy, et al., 2013; Di Baldassarre, Viglione, et al., 2013; Di Baldassarre et al., 2015; Gohari et al., 2013; Sivapalan et al., 2012, 2014; Srinivasan et al., 2012). We posit that the field of sociohydrology has the potential to bridge the gap between the broad SDGs and the more specific IWRM/WRS set of principles and methodologies by seeking to gain insights that are both generalizable and actionable. Sociohydrology has an important role to play by emphasizing the need to broaden the conversation concerning water-related issues so that they are addressed (i) holistically and inclusively, considering broader, socio-cultural, and socio-political perspectives; and (ii) by considering both short-term and long-term consequences of shifts in water governance. This paper surveys the scientific challenges faced by sociohydrology toward addressing the complex water management challenge identified above. We start by documenting and synthesizing socio-hydrological phenomena explored to date and the generalized understanding gained so far. Next, we discuss and highlight the scientific and methodological challenges that remain, and the opportunities toward integrating the social and hydrological sciences. This is essential for strengthening the field of sociohydrology, and broadening its scope to underpin IWRM and support policy makers, governments, communities, and private sector organizations toward meeting the SDGs, which looms as a major societal grand challenge of the 21st century. 2 The Role of SocioHydrology in Conceptualizing the Water Implications of the SDGs 2.1 Classification of Phenomena Humans have significantly influenced the hydrological regime (Falkenmark & Rockström, 2008; Vörösmarty et al., 2013), deliberately or not (Blöschl et al., 2013; Savenije et al., 2014). Meanwhile, hydrological change tends to shape human society (Di Baldassarre et al., 2017), which responds to water crises, droughts, and floods in multiple ways, formally or not (Adger et al., 2013). The bidirectional feedbacks between human and water systems generate patterns across places or even across different contexts, which are the phenomena of interest to sociohydrology. These phenomena are actual outcomes, paradoxical dynamics, or unintended consequences that arise from water management to achieve a desired societal objective. They can result from the prevailing of political, commercial, or financial interests that might exacerbate social inequalities and ineffectiveness in water management. In this sense, they might be considered as manifestations of mismatch of governance with the (time, space, or organizational) scale of the coupled human-water system being governed (Cash et al., 2006) or of governance processes thick with politics (Castro, 2007). Such ignorance and mismatch can arise when governance is based on myopic, reductionist, or one-size-fits-all thinking. Sociohydrology aims to understand the feedback mechanisms generating these phenomena and the power relations, trust, cultural beliefs, and cognitive biases, which strongly influence the way in which people alter, and adapt to, changing hydrological regimes. The ultimate goal is to prevent mismatches of governance, in the first place, or at least overcome their adverse effects. Much of sociohydrology research has focused on the explanation of phenomena that have arisen in the context of floods (Di Baldassarre, Viglione, et al., 2013,Di Baldassarre, Kooy, et al., 2013, Di Baldassarre, Kemerink, et al., 2014,Di Baldassarre, Yan, et al., 2014; Di Baldassarre et al., 2015; Viglione et al., 2014; Grames et al., 2016; Ciullo et al., 2017; Barendrecht et al., 2019), droughts (Garcia et al., 2016; Srinivasan et al., 2017; Gonzales & Ajami, 2017; Di Baldassarre et al., 2017; Di Baldassarre, Kreibich, et al., 2018,Di Baldassarre, Wanders, et al., 2018; Treuer et al., 2017; Breyer et al., 2018), groundwater exploitation (Marston & Konar, 2017; Noël & Cai, 2017), water quality degradation (Chang et al., 2014; Giuliani et al., 2016), land degradation (Elshafei et al., 2014, 2016), farming and agriculture development (Fernald et al., 2015; Pande & Savenije, 2016), and water resources development (e.g., Chen et al., 2016; Kandasamy et al., 2014; Mostert, 2018; Srinivasan et al., 2012). Several studies have attributed the collapse or dispersal of ancient civilizations to unintended effects in water management or governance (e.g., Dermody et al., 2014; Kuil et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2013; Pande & Ertsen, 2014). Many of the phenomena studied to date manifest in the time domain. However, there is increased interest in phenomena that manifest in the space domain or in space-time (Breyer et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2016), as also highlighted in the recent review by Konar et al. (2018). Much can be learned by comparing and contrasting phenomena that arise in different places and in different contexts, and by seeking common explanations. This can be done by organizing them into groups of similar behavior, as was earlier done in terms of syndromes by Srinivasan et al. (2012) in the context of water resource development. We next present several classes of socio-hydrologic phenomena (Table 1) that have been explored over the last 6 years, providing the diversity of causes and contexts with which to generate understanding of coupled human-water system dynamics and to help meet several water-related SDG targets (see Figure 2).

Figure 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Water plays a key role in several specific targets of the SDGs, which are interconnected with socio-hydrological phenomena. The SDGs thus provide further motivation and the necessity to broaden the scope and strengthen the foundation of sociohydrology, which requires integration of hydrological and social science perspectives. SDGs = Sustainable Development Goals. According to the United Nations Office of Disaster Risk Reduction 2017 annual report (United Nations Office of Disaster Risk Reduction, UNISDR, 2018), capturing disaster risk dynamics is essential to achieve several SDGs. Shocks and stresses caused by disasters are likely to frustrate development achievements, and, in turn, bad development determines risk accumulation. Several SDGs are concerned with challenges that are related to risk accumulation, such as poverty (SDGs 1), reduction of inequalities (SDG 10), climate action (SDG 13), and peace, justice, and strong institutions (SDG 16). Sociohydrology has undertaken much work to understand feedbacks between society and hydrological extremes, such as droughts and flood. This work has advanced our understanding of the safe-development paradox or levee effect. This phenomenon describes instances in which protection measures, such as levees, generate a false sense of security (Ludy & Kondolf, 2012) and build up social vulnerabilities in risky areas (Burton & Cutter, 2008). As a result, paradoxically, risk can even increase after building such structural protection measures (Di Baldassarre, Kreibich, et al., 2018). Considering this phenomenon is crucial to meet numerous SDGs (Figure 2). The levee effect, for example, shows that the target of reducing fatalities caused by water-related disasters, such as floods (Target 11.5), cannot be achieved by merely building or reinforcing flood protection structures, but it requires a combination of nonstructural measures aiming to reduce vulnerabilities, including building codes or early warning systems (Kreibich et al., 2017). The safe-development paradox was first identified by Gilbert White as early as the 1940s (White, 1945), who criticized heavy reliance on structural flood protection in the United States. A recent example is the case of New Orleans, where a self-reinforcing process of raising levees to protect a growing urban environment has taken place over many decades (Kates et al., 2006). This has led to extreme, low-probability flooding, with catastrophic consequences, which are not evenly distributed across space and social groups. Masozera et al. (2007), for instance, analyzed the impact of flooding in New Orleans and found that preexisting socio-economic conditions played a major role in the inability of particular social groups to respond to the disaster and to cope with the flooding. Di Baldassarre, Wanders, et al. (2018) recently discussed the corresponding reservoir effect in the context of responses to droughts, showing how the safe-development paradox can equally well apply to water supply reservoirs. These are often built to alleviate droughts and water shortages, but they can eventually worsen them. It is important to note that societies are not homogeneous and social stratification determines how and who are affected by hydrological extremes as well as who comes up with the strategies to cope with change at different scales, that is, how hydrological risks are distributed. This was recently demonstrated in the city of Austin, Texas, in the context of water restrictions imposed by the city in response to a severe drought (Breyer et al., 2018). Dams, reservoirs, or other types of water infrastructure are often built to cope with drought and water scarcity. In the short-term, these human alterations of water storage and fluxes are often beneficial, as they can increase water supply. Yet increasing water supply enables additional urban, agricultural, or economic growth that in turn generates higher demand, which can then offset the benefits of, for example, reservoirs as water supply sources. This phenomenon, known as supply-demand cycle (Kallis, 2010), is a self-reinforcing feedback, or vicious cycle, as the occurrence of a new drought will then likely favor further expansion of, for example, reservoirs to increase water supply (Di Baldassarre, Wanders, et al., 2018). Similar dynamics generated by water transfer projects in Iran have been described as fixes that can backfire (Gohari et al., 2013). It is important to acknowledge the role of social stratification and spatial distribution of water supply in terms of how and who makes decisions to build or expand water infrastructure, and who actually benefits from the increased water supply, as well as how the costs and benefits are distributed (Merme et al., 2014; Molle et al., 2009; Tiwale et al., 2018). This phenomenon has many implications for numerous SDGs (Figure 2), including the implementation of IWRM (Target 6.5). Humans respond and adapt to hydrological extremes through a combination of spontaneous processes and deliberate strategies (Loucks et al., 2006, 2008) that can lead to, for example, changing the social contract (Adger et al., 2013). Adaptive responses can take place at the individual, community, or government level. They might lead to the emergence of the adaptation effect, that is, the negative impact of an extreme event tends to be lower if such an event occurs shortly after a similar one (Di Baldassarre et al., 2015; Kreibich et al., 2017). For instance, the economic losses of the 1995 Meuse River flooding in Central Europe were remarkably lower than those of 1993, even though the magnitudes of the two events were similar (Wind et al., 1999). Similarly, adaptation effects and decreasing flood fatalities have been observed in Bangladesh over the past decades (Kreibich et al., 2017; Mechler & Bouwer, 2015). While the adaptation effect is often associated with desirable outcomes, it can also have adverse consequences. Adaptation to drought conditions can exacerbate the negative impacts of floods, and vice versa (Di Baldassarre et al., 2017). For instance, changing reservoir operations to cope with drought, such as keeping the reservoirs as full as possible to buffer low flow conditions, can prevent required flood attenuation if heavy rainfall occurs during drought termination. This was seen, for example, during the catastrophic 2011 flooding in Brisbane that occurred shortly after the Millennium Drought in Australia or the extreme heavy rainfall causing the Oroville spillway collapse during the termination of the last multiyear drought in California (Mallakpour et al., 2019). Di Baldassarre et al. (2017) suggested that human migration from drought-affected areas, as seen for example in Somalia (World Bank, 2018), can lead to more people living in riparian areas and therefore more exposed to flooding. Many communities (be they agricultural or urban) that rely on river flow and/or groundwater to advance their economic livelihoods have been observed to swing between water extraction for food production or water control for urban development in the early stages, followed by efforts to mitigate and reverse degradation of the riparian environment, resulting from reduction of streamflows or depletion of groundwater. This is variously known as pendulum swing. This phenomenon was observed in the Murrumbidgee River basin in eastern Australia (Kandasamy et al., 2014), Lake Toolibin basin in Western Australia (Elshafei et al., 2014, 2016), and the Tarim basin in western China (Liu et al., 2015). In all three cases, increased water extraction, land clearance, and construction of water infrastructure are equally accompanied and driven by population growth and economic gain. In the short and intermediate terms, as per capita economic gain increases, the basin presents an attractive lifestyle proposition, causing human migration into the basin. In the long term, however, human actions that advance economic prosperity continue until the quantity or quality of water resources and the state of environment begin to impede further growth through the cost of environmental degradation and reduced productivity (Kandasamy et al., 2014). As the degradation of the environment continues, economic growth will naturally become constrained and communities will be compelled to act in efforts to reverse the negative threat to their livelihoods and well-being. In many arid regions of the world, water shortage most severely restricts socio-economic development. Under such circumstances, developing highly efficient agriculture through water-saving technology is regarded as an effective method to expand the economy, conserve water, and protect the environment. A range of technologies to increase irrigation efficiency and save water has proven successful at the farm scale. Yet, in the absence of appropriate governance measures, the increased efficiency often presents a paradox when assessed at larger scales because the saved water is often reallocated to irrigating an expanded land area or transferred to other uses (e.g., industrial or municipal water use), thus only to increase water consumption and deprive ecosystems of much needed flows. These are the unintended consequences arising from the push toward technological solutions without consideration of broader socio-cultural behaviors and their consequences. This is known as the irrigation efficiency paradox and can be seen as a facet of an economic rebound effect or Jevons paradox (Alcott, 2005; Jevons, 1866). Increasing the efficiency of irrigation often leads to higher consumption of water, because farmers switch to more profitable and water-consuming crops (Dumont et al., 2013). An example is the coupled use of water and energy in Mexico, where efficient and subsidized electricity supplied to pump groundwater for irrigation had the unintended effect of increasing the pumping, thus speeding up aquifer depletion (Scott, 2011; Scott et al., 2013). Similarly, in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in western China, total water consumption continued to increase even as irrigation efficiency dramatically improved through the application of water-saving technology (e.g., plastic mulching). However, the securing of additional freshwater resources through increased efficiency only encouraged farmers to expand the land area brought under irrigation, negating much of the water savings obtained through mulching (Liu, 2016; Zhang et al., 2014). This phenomenon is connected to numerous SDGs (Figure 2). Its emergence clearly complicates, for example, the goal of upgrading infrastructure to increase resource use efficiency (Target 9.4). Other socio-hydrological phenomena include what we term here as the aggregation effect and institutional complexity. The former relates to a mismatch of outcomes at the aggregated level of decisions taken at the individual level. A key example is known as collective action problem in the social sciences, which refers to situations where all individuals would be better off by jointly acting toward a common goal but fail to do so because of their self-interest (Olson, 1965). This paradox originates from the common-pool resource nature of water resources and the public good nature of water infrastructure and the combination of individual rationality and difficulties associated with coordination of large groups (Kollock, 1998). If overlooked, this issue can lead to outcomes such as overuse of groundwater and under provision of water infrastructure. To cope with this issue, rules and norms that regulate individual behavior need to be endogenously developed by the community or imposed on it endogenously (Ostrom, 1990). However, whether and how such governance arrangements can be achieved is itself a major challenge. Ostrom herself suggested in recent work (see, for instance, Van Laerhoven & Ostrom, 2007) that furthering common property resource management requires dealing with the uncertainty and complexity of institutional processes. Concurrently, over the past two decades, critical institutionalism has highlighted how the dynamic relationship between individuals, society, and natural resources is shaped by power relations and constant renegotiations that fuse socially embedded norms with new arrangements through a process of bricolage (Cleaver & De Koning, 2015; Rusca et al., 2015). Getting institutions right and development by design are, therefore, likely to lead to unintended outcomes (Cleaver, 2017). Feedbacks among the states of water resources, individual behavior, and change in governance arrangements can generate dynamics that are difficult to understand by treating water and human systems separately. Socio-hydrological studies dealing with this phenomenon include the management of water infrastructure in relation to flooding (Yu, Sangwan, et al., 2017), irrigation (Muneepeerakul & Anderies, 2017; Yu et al., 2015), and groundwater exploitation (Madani & Dinar, 2012; Müller et al., 2017). Aggregation effects could also produce perverse outcomes. These, for instance, occur when desirable outcomes at a larger scale conceal inequalities and, as such, distributional injustices at the local scale (Zwarteveen et al., 2017). A study on drinking water by Tiwale et al. (2018) found that additional reservoirs built to supply water for the underserved or unserved population of Lilongwe (Malawi) ended up improving continuity of supply for those who were already served, rather than quenching the thirst of the growing urban population. While at the urban scale water availability had improved, inequalities in access between different neighborhoods had increased. This example illustrates the limits of focusing on average values, while overlooking distribution across space and social groups. To determine whether anyone is left behind, as called for by the SDGs, requires disaggregated data, spanning from socio-economic status, gender, age, and geographic location (Satterthwaite, 2016a, 2016b; Stuart & Woodroffe, 2016). As further elaborated below, sociohydrology can contribute to address important questions of equity by examining how development of large water infrastructure, such as reservoirs, and access to extra water intersects with gender, race, and socio-economic status. These effects are also central to the three paradoxes identified in the most recent World Water Development Report (UN Water, 2019): (1) supplying the bulk of food and yet poor and hungry; (2) substantive investments in water infrastructure in rural areas and yet the rural poor lack access to water; and (3) small-holder farmers being water productive and yet overlooked. The institutional complexity effect relates to the trade-off between resilience and efficiency of human-water systems (Muneepeerakul & Anderies, 2017) generated by increased complexities of shared water infrastructure and related governance arrangements. Measures that increase performance and stability are preferred by managers. As such, coupled human-water systems often evolve in ways that add more complex infrastructure and governance arrangements to reduce hydrological variability and increase system performance (Anderies, 2015). However, historical events showed that such complexities are often associated with hidden vulnerabilities to other types of disturbances, which are revealed through catastrophic failures (ibid). This line of inquiry has mostly focused on endogenous growth in the Indus and Hohokam civilizations (Pande & Ertsen, 2014) and virtual water trade in the Roman Empire (Dermody et al., 2014). Complex systems literature refers to this phenomenon as robustness-fragility trade-off (Csete & Doyle, 2002). Overall, the phenomena discussed above provide significant insights into human-water interactions at different temporal and spatial scales. These phenomena have clear implications for SDGs and can inform policies and strategies to achieve water-related targets (Figure 2). 2.2 Explanation of the Phenomena One of the main goals of sociohydrology is to explore the feedback mechanisms that may have caused the emergent phenomena. The driving logic of scientific discovery in sociohydrology is if these feedback mechanisms operate, here is the phenomenon it can produce as well as if this phenomenon happens, here are the feedback mechanisms that might explain it (Elster, 2007). A suite of different methods has been utilized in various studies to provide these explanations. One common approach adopted in the social sciences is the use of statistical analysis of empirical research data, obtained through surveys and interviews (Brown, 2007; Daniel et al., 2018; Sanderson et al., 2017), some of which is qualitative. In this context, a set of interesting methods has been developed that combine the strengths of qualitative and quantitative data (Driscoll et al., 2007; Jick, 1979). An example is the work by Leong (2018) to convert narratives of perceptions of floods in Assam, India, to quantitative forms, similar to water volumes and prices, using the so-called Q methodology. A second approach to explain phenomena, especially in the absence of long time series of observations, which has gathered increased momentum, is agent-based modeling (Du et al., 2017; Noël & Cai, 2017). These models operate by prescribing rules on how individuals and/or institutions (the agents) interact, obtained through field surveys and interviews of people in real places, and thus allow the heterogeneous individual (or group) behavior to be accommodated. They help to compute the interactions at the microlevel between agents and allow describing social behaviors at the macrolevel or to interpret observed behavior at these higher levels and attribute them to both microscale and macroscale factors (Gilbert, 2008; Gilbert & Terna, 2000). A third common approach, called system dynamics modeling (e.g., Di Baldassarre, Viglione, et al., 2013; Garcia et al., 2016; Gohari et al., 2013; Srinivasan, 2015) is adopted in the presence of long time series of natural or water system behavior (e.g., hydrology, water use, and ecology) and social system behavior (e.g., demographics, economics, industries, and technology). The approach is guided by a limited number of hypotheses about fundamental natural and social processes and their interactions driving the overall behavior of the system, as illustrated by a stylized model for an urban socio-hydrological system of Chennai, India, developed by Srinivasan (2015). More commonly, though, these hypotheses are explicitly formalized (in mathematical terms) using a set of coupled differential equations. Di Baldassarre et al. (2015) argue that the strength of this method is its transparency, flexibility, and ability to capture the dynamics emerging from interacting processes. Most early models of sociohydrology have been based on the system dynamics approach; see Blair and Buytaert (2016) and Troy, Pavao-Zuckerman, & Evans, 2015, Troy, Konar, et al., 2015) for comprehensive reviews of recent socio-hydrological models. These have been proposed as explanatory hypotheses about feedback mechanisms generating one or more observed classes of phenomena. The explanatory model depicted in Figure 3a, for example, is a (generic) system dynamics model, based on coupled differential equations (Di Baldassarre, Viglione, et al., 2013), that aims to explain, in a stylized manner, phenomena often observed in flood risk studies, that is, the aforementioned safe-development paradox and adaptation effect. In the same way, Figure 3b depicts a (place-based) conceptual model of the human-water dynamics in the Murrumbidgee River basin in eastern Australia, including the competition between humans and the environment (Van Emmerik et al., 2014) that underlies the pendulum swing phenomenon. Similar place-based models have been developed for the pendulum swing phenomena documented in Western Australia (Elshafei et al., 2014, 2016) and Tarim basin in western China (Liu et al., 2015). Figure 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Examples of socio-hydrological models as hypotheses about the feedback mechanisms generating one or more phenomena: (a) generic conceptualization of human-flood interactions (Di Baldassarre, Viglione, et al., 2013) and (b) coupled human-water dynamics in Murrumbidgee River basin (Van Emmerik et al., 2014). The endogenization of human agency is the key to explain emergent phenomena (Pande & Sivapalan, 2017). To this end, different hypotheses have been proposed in sociohydrology. Di Baldassarre, Viglione, et al. (2013); Di Baldassarre et al. (2015) and Viglione et al. (2014), for example, built upon the concept of social memory (Folke et al., 2005) and explained the safe-development paradox as resulting from a decay of flood memory during prolonged periods IN which flooding does not occur. In the same spirit, Van Emmerik et al. (2014), Liu et al. (2013), and Liu et al. (2015) explained the pendulum swing as the result of a competition between an economic productive force that favors human livelihoods and an environmental restorative force that favors the environment. As in Di Baldassarre, Viglione, et al. (2013), it was proposed that this competition was mediated by another social state variable, which Van Emmerik et al. (2014) termed an environmental awareness, and was later generalized by Elshafei et al. (2014) as community sensitivity. These social variables (e.g., social memory, community sensitivity) therefore played a central role in the development of associated coupled socio-hydrological models. Elshafei et al. (2014), and subsequently Elshafei et al. (2016), provided an avenue for generalization of community sensitivity by connecting it to broad socio-economic and socio-cultural factors (e.g., human development index and corruption perception index). Roobavannan et al. (2017) further enhanced the power of community sensitivity by making it a function of the structure of the regional economy. The resulting suite of system dynamics models using either social memory or community sensitivity as a key state variable to explain the emergence of socio-hydrological phenomena in effect have helped to endogenize human behavior and the feedbacks with the water system through deterministic human response relationships. For example, the migration of people out of, or toward, the Murrumbidgee River basin to or from other parts of eastern Australia was inspired by a law similar to Fick's law of dispersal (i.e., migration flux is proportional to negative gradient of unemployment), while community sensitivity itself was defined as a trade-off between environmental health and economic well-being. Migrants are often driven by their expectation of improved employment or earnings (Mabogunje, 1970; Todaro, 1969). Aspirations of better lives are based on household level decisions to either maximize expected income or minimize risk that the household is exposed to by diversifying the portfolio of income generating activities (Massey et al., 1993; Akay et al., 2012). Yet the decisions to migrate are often limited by substantial social and economic barriers (Bryan et al., 2014). As a result, it is often the individuals whose income is above average that migrate (Knight & Gunatilaka, 2010). The effect of natural hazards such as droughts and flooding can therefore be ambiguous (Chen et al., 2017; Gray & Mueller, 2012). On the one hand, it can reduce migration by removing resources necessary for migration to overcome set up costs or increasing labor demand in originating areas, while in some other cases it may reduce all income generating possibilities, pushing migrants en masse out of affected areas (Chen et al., 2017). Therefore, while migration may appear to respond to unemployment gradient (Roobavannan et al., 2017), it is much more complex phenomenon that deserves closer scrutiny. There have also been early efforts to generalize from conclusions based on place-based studies. One of the ways to achieve this is to invoke (either explicitly or implicitly) existing economic or sociological theories to propose alternative hypotheses about the feedback mechanisms that contribute to the emergence of socio-hydrological phenomena. For example, Roobavannan et al. (2018) compared the outcomes of a socio-hydrologic model of community sensitivity (Elshafei et al., 2014, 2016) with an independent analysis of proxy data (i.e., references to concerns about the environment appearing in Australian newspapers over a 100-year period) carried out by Wei et al. (2017). Based on this analysis they argued that the concept of community sensitivity is consistent with the values beliefs norms theory widely adopted in sociology. Other socio-hydrological modeling studies have postulated human behavior as one that maximizes a livelihood objective. Pande et al. (2011), for example, modeled basin-scale water allocation based on profit maximization in agricultural production. Pande and Ertsen (2014) and Pande et al. (2014) provided an interpretation of the rise and dispersal of societies using endogenous growth theory, wherein actions of humans in maximizing their well-being result in the formation of grander coalitions (i.e., rise of civilizations) and technological progress that accelerates both growth and environmental degradation. Grames et al. (2016) provided an economic, albeit profit maximizing interpretation of the safe-development paradox. While these models assumed that humans are consistently able to compare and contrast alternative bundles of goods and services and maximize their well-being based on it (i.e., that they are rational), other approaches have been recently used to model apparently irrational behavior at individual and collective levels. Di Baldassarre et al. (2017), for instance, developed a system dynamics model by capturing cognitive biases at individual level in the management of droughts and floods, inspired by the idea of the availability heuristic in behavioral economics (Gal, 2018; Kahneman & Tversky, 1979). Yu et al. (2017) used evolutionary game theory to model the evolution of informal rules or norms of a community and associated collective action dynamics related to levee maintenance. Their model captures the social dilemma of how individually rational behavior can lead to collectively irrational outcome of poor levee maintenance as well as how the removal of short-term flooding can lead to erosion of people's compliance to informal rules that regulate the social dilemma and, ultimately, erosion of community resilience to floods. Finally, Gunda et al. (2018) investigated the water stress response of the Valdez acequia in New Mexico (a community-managed irrigation system) by linking a hydrological model to the system dynamics model of an acequia developed by Turner et al. (2016). They focused on the role that community social structure, in particular mutualism, plays in the ability of the acequia to maintain its functionality. They found that, while agricultural productivity declined, the community was able to maintain its functionality under streamflow declines due to adaptations like shifting crop selection. The engagement with existing sociological and economic theories, and the development of new ones specific to sociohydrology, to provide explanations of observed socio-hydrologic phenomena is important to ascertain whether these are exceptional dynamics occurring in particular places or are generic ones that can be extrapolated to other places or circumstances. However, they take on added significance in the context of the SDGs since, in the absence of previous history, we will be expected to drive policy choices within which water resource development can be kept in the safe operating space for humanity (Rockström et al., 2009). Since coupled human-water systems are complex systems that involve dynamics at multiple levels of human organization (Sivapalan & Blöschl, 2015), multiple levels of theories are likely to be needed to more fully understand socio-hydrological phenomena. At individual level, promising theories of human behavior that remain insufficiently exploited in sociohydrology are the expected utility theory (Neumann & Morgenstern, 1944), protection motivation theory (Rogers, 1975), prospect theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979), game theory (Morrow, 1994), path dependency (Mahoney, 2000), and rebound effect or Jevon's paradox (Alcott, 2005). At collective level, applicable theories for explaining social change include collective action theory (Olson, 1965), institutionalist thinking (Cleaver, 2017; Ostrom, 1990; Van Laerhoven & Ostrom, 2007), and cultural evolution (Boyd & Richerson, 1985). Finally, at systems level, relevant theories could include resilience thinking (Walker et al., 2004), complex adaptive systems (Mitchell, 2009), metabolism theory (Banavar et al., 2002), and feedback control system theory (Doyle et al., 1990). 2.3 Reconceptualizing Water and Society Relations in the Context of SDGs According to several scholars working across disciplines, the United Nations SDGs mark a paradigm shift in the way nature and society relations are understood and addressed in human development. First, the SDGs promote the notion of coupled human-nature systems in which poverty reduction and planetary health are seen as intrinsically intertwined (Bello, 2013; Death & Gabay, 2015; Griggs et al., 2013; Langford, 2016; McMichael, 2017; Schleicher et al., 2018). It is argued that their transformative potential can only materialize if trade-offs and the relation between poverty and environmental degradation are made explicit (Schleicher et al., 2018). Second, the three dimensions of sustainability have been presented as an indivisible whole and scholars warn that a fragmented implementation would generate perverse outcomes (Morton et al., 2017; Nilsson et al., 2016). The nexus and trade-offs within the SDGs, however, have only been superficially explored in the past. If on the one hand enhancing policy coherence for sustainable development is a key concern in the SDGs project (Target 17.14.1), on the other hand most complex and politically contentious trade-offs have been glossed over in the international negotiations (Nilsson et al., 2016). Consequently, the multiple ways in which goals and dimensions of sustainability are interdependent are not explicitly discussed (Karlsson-Vinkhuyzen et al., 2018). As aptly illustrated by Alcamo (2019: 126), acting on synergies and trade-offs requires not only political will but also knowledge about their origin and characteristics. The risk, therefore, is that policy makers and bureaucrats end up working in vertical silos rather than through horizontal integrative approaches (Nilsson et al., 2016; Vandemoortele, 2011). Increasingly, scholars call for enhancing empirical knowledge on trade-offs and synergies that can inform SDGs implementation processes. The UN's report Mainstreaming of the three dimensions of sustainable development throughout the United Nations system (UN Economic & Social Council, 2016) places water as a key integration force and highlights the relationship between multiple goals. Sociohydrology can play an important role in conceptualizing SDG trade-offs and feedback loops in the context of water-society relations at different temporal and spatial scales. In section 3 we have shown how the body of literature that relates to sociohydrology has already theorized several phenomena that are relevant to the implementation of the SDGs. In the section that follows, we discuss opportunities to enrich sociohydrology by broadening its scope to address other water management dimensions relevant to the SDGs. 2.4 Expansion of Socio-Hydrologic Phenomena: Broadening the Scope of SocioHydrology Socio-hydrologic phenomena taken up for study over the last 6 years have mostly examined human-flood, human-drought, and human-environment interactions and feedbacks. Yet the role of water in SDGs extends well beyond these. For example, water resources are connected to food and energy production. Excessive exploitation of water to produce food and energy contributes to environmental degradation in some places. Hence, in addition to competition for water between humans and the environment, managing water in a broader context requires decisions about different human-water uses (e.g., water vs food vs energy), or between different water hazards (e.g., floods vs droughts), both in time (e.g., short- vs long-term considerations) and in space (e.g., upstream vs downstream and urban vs rural). Below, we focus on three examples: water pollution and human health, water-energy-food nexus, and transboundary water management. 2.4.1 Water Pollution and Human Health Globally, population growth and economic development have contributed to increased contamination (e.g., heavy metals, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and fecal matter) of water supplies and of health risks related to waterborne diseases (Bain et al., 2014; Liu, Zhang, et al., 2017; Ternes et al., 2015). Although research on drinking water has overwhelmingly focused on use and access, a number of studies have examined contamination and its societal consequences and feedbacks at different scales. Work on the effects of coupled human-water systems on drinking water quality includes research on the arsenic crisis in South East Asia and Bangladesh, respectively, analyzing hydrology of geogenic arsenic groundwater and health implications (Winkel et al., 2008; Michael & Voss, 2008; Sultana, 2011), and the role of power and gendered relations in shaping access to contaminated water (Sultana, 2006). Another example is recent research on intermittent water supply, which has demonstrated how Escherichia coli contamination is more likely to occur in areas where supply is not continuous (Agathokleous & Christodoulou, 2016; Kumpel & Nelson, 2013). Over 300 million people globally are served by intermittent water supply, and those who live in areas with inadequate sanitation are at higher risk of drinking contaminated water (Kumpel & Nelson, 2016; Sarpong Boakye-Ansah et al., 2016). Risks of contamination are further exacerbated by storage practices adopted by residents to cope with discontinuity (Burt & Ray, 2014; Rusca et al., 2017). Improved sources are, thus, not necessarily free of pathogens and parasites and can cause waterborne diseases (Bain et al., 2014; Ercumen et al., 2015; Shaheed et al., 2014; Tosi Robinson et al., 2018). Although these studies have identified technical challenges and household coping strategies that might lead to contamination and the health implications thereof, in the context of the SDGs more work can be done to unravel the interplay between the political economy of water and sanitation services, water contamination at different scales, and distribution of its risks. A growing body of literature proposes that safe water has become a commodity and calls for examining the relation between deterioration of water quality, class, gender, race, and indigenous rights to water (Rusca, Alda-Vidal, et al., 2017,Rusca, Boakye-Ansah, et al., 2017; Dodman et al., 2017; Vandewalle & Jepson, 2015). These studies suggest that there is a trend of vulnerable and marginalized communities suffering the most from exposure to unsafe drinking water. Sociohydrology can contribute by capturing more explicitly the dynamics generated by the interweaving of human and water-quality transformations and the uneven distribution of risk through research on feedback loops between wastewater/sludge flows and society, including the economic, cultural, engineering, and human behaviors surrounding its mitigation and production at different scales. The recent water crisis in Flint (Michigan, USA), for instance, mostly affected urban dwellers of more economically depressed background. The study by Butler et al. (2016) importantly shows the relationship among urbanization, economic development, inequalities, politics of water management, and water contamination. Flint developed mostly because of a thriving motor industry, while toxic industrial effluents contaminated the Detroit River. The ending of industrial activities left the city impoverished and, more recently, under emergency management to deal with the economic hardship. When, in order to reduce costs, the water supply was temporarily switched from Lake Huron to the Detroit River, residents were exposed for over 18 months to lead contaminated water, which caused elevated blood lead levels in residents, with irreversible impacts on children (Hanna-Attisha et al., 2016; Liu, Zhang, et al., 2017). As for the pendulum swing phenomenon discussed above, economic and industrial development in the short term caused surface water contamination and environmental degradation in the long term. Ultimately, human actions led to contamination of drinking water, which compromised the health of residents. One promising approach to capture sociohydrology of unsafe drinking water and its uneven distribution is developing interdisciplinary case studies that account for both the hydrological and social dimensions of water-quality transformations. The aforementioned study by Rusca, Boakye-Ansah, et al. (2017), for instance, drew attention to the interdependencies between socio-political processes and microbiological and physiochemical contamination of drinking water and proposes a methodological approach to capture these (see also Boakye-Ansah et al., 2016). Concurrently, sociohydrology may further understandings of risk perception in relation with water contamination and how extreme events may influence it. For instance, polls following the Flint water crisis show approximately half of the American population distrusts their tap water (Baum et al., 2016). These perceptions may, in turn, affect the way in which people access and consume water. All together these lines of inquiry have the potential to contribute to advancing SDG 6, as well as SDG 3 on good health and well-being, especially ending waterborne diseases by 2030 (Target 3.3). Last, synergies and trade-offs involving water quality extend well beyond Goal 6. Alcamo (2019) points to some important and less explored trade-offs: the expansion of conventional agriculture may contribute to Goal 2 (Zero hunger) but is likely to increase water pollution downstream; on the other end, high-saline-polluted water is inadequate for irrigation. Wastewater treatment is an energy intensive activity and will negatively impact Goal 7 (affordable and clean energy, see also Yillia, 2016). Today, at least one third of the rivers in Africa, Latin America, and Asia is polluted by untreated wastewater (United Nations Environment Program, UNEP, 2016). Wastewater treatment is, therefore, likely to have a major impact on the conservation, restoration, and sustainable use of terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems (Target 15.1). Last, as good water quality is a prerequisite of subsistence, it plays an important role in targets such as slum upgrading (Target 11.1) and reduction of inequalities (SDG 10) (Alcamo, 2019). 2.4.2 Water-Energy-Food Nexus Water plays a key role in several SDGs (as seen in Figure 2), and therefore, water management must account for these multiple interacting objectives, not just focusing on clean water and sanitation (UN Water, 2018). For example, water is at the heart of current research in the water-energy-food nexus across all spatial scales of analysis (Cudennec et al., 2018; D'Odorico et al., 2018; Lant et al., 2018; Liu, Yang, et al., 2017). A study by Yillia (2016) reveals the multiple trade-offs and interconnections within this nexus. He suggests that interdependencies between water and energy have mostly focused on how few elements interact, rather than taking a more holistic and comprehensive approach. The interactions, she argues, are multiple and take place at different scales. These range from the use of water (SDG 6) to extract and transport energy sources, produce and convert energy, irrigate crops for biofuel production, and water intensive renewable energy (SDG 8). Energy is needed for treatment, distribution, and transport of drinking water and desalination (SDG6), as well as for irrigation (SD2). Last, as mentioned above, wastewater treatment is an energy intensive activity that plays a key role in ensuring water quality (SDG 6) and ecosystem protection (SDG 15). Much research has been devoted to evaluating the vast water resources virtually embedded in internationally and regionally traded commodities, including food and energy (Allan, 2011; Hoekstra & Mekonnen, 2012; Konar et al., 2011; Marston et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2017). Future sociohydrology research may strive to represent these virtual flows of water in order to understand the full producer-consumer chain of economic goods that require water (Konar et al., 2016). This will enable consumers to identify the water resources infrastructure that is supporting their food and energy receipts, enabling better accounting across SDGs. Critically, resolving these flows will enable consumers to better assess the exposure of their supply chains to water stress and shocks. During the 2008 annual meeting of the World Economic Forum, participants called for a better understanding of the relationship between economic growth and (virtual) water flows (WEF Water Initiative, 2011). Causal inference research in economics has shown that international trade leads to increased economic growth (Frankel & Romer, 1999). Virtual water flows are essentially a rescaled metric of international commodity trade (typically provided in mass [tons] or value [$] units). It is therefore likely that virtual water trade also drives economic growth, though future research is to confirm this. Relatedly, recent causal inference work by Dang and Konar (2018) has shown that trade openness reduces the amount of water that the countries use in agriculture, with no impact to the industrial or total water use of nations. This research shows the average impact of trade on water use. Future research may explore the implications of trade for water use in specific settings and time domains. This work by Dang and Konar (2018) highlights the interconnected nature of food-energy-water systems and illustrates that policies in one system may have spillover effects to another (e.g., economic trade policy has unintended consequences for water use in agriculture). Similarly, recent research by Deryugina and Konar (2017) employed causal inference methods to understand the impact of crop insurance on water use. They find that crop insurance leads to more irrigation withdrawals in agriculture, mainly due to farmers deciding to grow more water-intensive crops. Thus, these studies highlight that policies that are supposedly unrelated to water (e.g., trade and crop insurance) can have unexpected consequences in terms of water consumptions. Similarly, the International Water Management Institute highlights how working to achieve the food SDG can have spillover effects for water (International Water Management Institute, 2018). This indicates that the SDGs are interrelated, and efforts to work toward the goal of one SDG may have unintended consequences for other SDGs. Future sociohydrology research should aim to better understand the complex interactions that exist in the food-energy-water nexus to enhance our ability to address all SDGs. 2.4.3 Transboundary Water Management Different SDGs give rise to different fundamental questions. Underlying questions concerning international basins is, as illustrated by Petersen-Perlman et al. (2017, p. 13), the idea that being part of a transboundary basin makes a user interconnected with the rest of its users. For example, specific measures to promote economic growth (SDG 8) in a given place, for example, building large water infrastructure for food or energy production, can jeopardize other objectives in other places, such as reducing inequalities (SDG 10) or protecting and restoring water-related ecosystems (SDG 15). In this perspective, cooperation in transboundary rivers (SDG6) can be also seen as one of the major environmental challenges of the century (Song & Whittington, 2004). This is particularly true in transboundary rivers that flow across political boundaries (De Stefano et al., 2017; Grey & Sadoff, 2003). The riparian states usually value water differently, leading to differences in water management regime, priorities, and culture. Consequently, transboundary river systems are characterized by both conflict and cooperation (Petersen-Perlman & Wolf, 2015; Yoffe et al., 2003; Zeitoun & Mirumachi, 2008). Conflict and cooperation in transboundary rivers can be seen as socio-hydrological phenomena driven by the interplay of hydrological, technical, and social processes. They remain widely underresearched and not well understood. For example, it was found that no single indicator, be it climate, water scarcity, government type, or water demand, could explain the emergence of either conflict or cooperation (Yoffe et al., 2003). Hence, sociohydrology can contribute to a better understanding of cooperative and noncooperative responses by interpreting them as outcomes of long-term coevolution (Pande & Ertsen, 2014), or as the effect of single events, such as the construction of the large dam or the occurrence of a climatic shock (Gleick, 2014). Therefore, taking a socio-hydrological approach to transboundary water management can help to unravel the feedback mechanisms that explain these phenomena (Mianabadi et al., 2015) and, in turn, to meet water and environment-related SDGs. 3 Scientific Challenges in Integrating the Social and Hydrological Dimensions As sociohydrology strives to make headway toward improved understanding of the phenomena reviewed in sections 2 and 3 and broadens in scope to cope with a wider range of phenomena, including new phenomena that are likely to arise in the process of aiming to meet the SDGs, new methodological challenges arise. This section presents these challenges and outlines possible ways forward toward confronting these challenges. 3.1 Mechanisms and Phenomena Across Temporal and Spatial Scales One of the major challenges for sociohydrology is that the interplay of human and water systems involves both hydrological processes and social processes (and institutions) operating at multiple spatial and time scales (Figure 4). Capturing how these processes interact across time and space scales, for example, how short-term processes affect longer term processes, and vice versa can provide important insights on the possible short- and long-term impacts of implementing the SDGs and on spatial distribution of these impacts. Figure 4 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Temporal and spatial scales in (a) hydrological processes (Blöschl & Sivapalan, 1995) and (b) institutions (Gunderson & Holling, 2001). 3.1.1 Temporal Dynamics and Time Scale Interactions Many of the phenomena discussed in section 2, such as the safe development paradox and the pendulum swing, tend to operate over long (decadal or centennial) time scales, but they often involve short-term processes, such as the seasonal cycle of irrigation, or flood inundation and defense activities that happen within hours. Flood formation is coupled with event scale precipitation and seasonal soil moisture as well as with soil, vegetation, landscape, and climate evolution occurring over centuries to millennia (Gaál et al., 2012). Similarly, in human-water systems, natural resources will slowly degrade if overused by human activities, such as water extraction or land use changes that do not allow for recovery (Ward et al., 2018). For example, large-scale deforestation in Western Australia for agriculture caused shifts to the water balance, leading to slowly rising water tables and extensive land and stream salinization, which contributed to a decline in agriculture and reduction of human population (Elshafei et al., 2014, 2016). The infrastructure system, typically, follows a slow evolutionary path linked to innovation through the interplay between technology and society (Geels, 2005; Pande et al., 2014). Technology includes infrastructure development to exploit water resources (e.g., irrigation) or improved water use efficiency in agriculture (Kandasamy et al., 2014), or river training and construction of levees to protect cities from flooding (Di Baldassarre, Kooy, et al., 2013). However, infrastructure develops in response to accumulated effects of human-water interactions that occur at short time scales, for example, frequent flooding in urban communities can lead to raising or strengthening levees, likewise frequent water shortages in agricultural communities can lead to expanding water storage via reservoirs. Depending on what time scales are considered, different feedbacks may become relevant (Blöschl & Sivapalan, 1995). If short time scales are considered, slow processes will not change much and so can be assumed as fixed boundary conditions, while this is no longer the case over a longer time frame. This notion was recognized as early as 1890 by economist Marshall (1890). He considered a market period (hours) where goods produced for sale on the market, for example, in a fish market prices are taken as given, but quickly adjust to clear markets; over longer periods industrial capacity is taken as given but outputs, employment, and inputs of raw materials fluctuate; at even longer periods the stock of capital goods, such as factories and machines, will fluctuate; when looking at even longer time frames, technology, population trends, habits, and customs are all likely to change. 3.1.2 Legacy Risks For long-term processes related to hydrological, technical, or social parts of the system, a long-term perspective becomes extremely relevant, particularly if it is difficult (or expensive) to reverse any decisions that are made. Some of the phenomena (Table 1) make it difficult for actors to reverse decisions when lock-in situations occur. Such lock-in situations may be economically, politically, or culturally driven. For example, due to the safe-development paradox, or levee effect, once people have moved into floodplains it may be politically and economically difficult to relocate them to safer ground. Due to the irrigation efficiency paradox or economic rebound effect, a lock-in situation occurred in India, where smallholders pumped groundwater at no cost as a result of subsidized energy. This measure is difficult to reverse as it enhances the stability of the elected provincial government (Shah et al., 2012). The supply-demand cycle may result in lock-ins due to high investment costs and may make societies dependent on expensive infrastructure, such as reservoirs for drought management (Di Baldassarre, Wanders, et al., 2018; Kuil et al., 2018, 2019), and eventually may result into a negative spiral toward peak water limits (Gleick & Palaniappan, 2010). The importance of decisions over long time frames for these types of processes is reflected in the concept of legacy risk, which is the expected cost of decisions made today carried over a very long time frame. Traditionally, the concept of legacy risk originated in the domains of nuclear waste and mining as these are processes that may linger over very long time periods (Pepper et al., 2014; Russell, 2000). The concept, however, applies to a range of processes, including environmental management (Winiwarter et al., 2016). The idea is to put particular emphasis in today's planning on those decisions that may have enormous adverse effects for generations to come and will be difficult to reverse. The choice is a difficult one as legacy risks the nation chooses not to bear cannot be separated from the opportunity costs (benefits given up elsewhere) it willingly incurs in reducing them. Both risks and costs are defined by inhabitants' values and preferences (and thus culture) and are not restricted to narrow, objective measures (Russell, 2000, p. 4). Over and above this, there is also the issue of equity in relation to intergenerational and intragenerational distribution of risks and costs of these developments, as well as equity between different sectors of society (Zwarteveen et al., 2017; Zwarteveen & Boelens, 2014). 3.1.3 Spatial Processes and Space-Scale Interactions Water-related issues have a spatial component, which shapes trade-offs, compromises, and negotiations between conflicting interests in different parts of the river basin (Loucks et al., 2005). In the water system, the spatial component arises because of spatial linkages of the water cycle. These linkages occur at all spatial scales, from the hillslope (through later surface and subsurface flow) right to the continental scale (through routing of water in river systems), and even globally (through atmospheric water transport) (Pringle, 2003; Savio et al., 2015; Van der Ent et al., 2010; Western et al., 1998). These spatial hydrological connectivities are relevant in terms of water quantity, such as upstream water uses that reduce downstream discharge; upstream flood retention that reduces downstream floods; water quality, that is, groundwater contamination affecting water quality further down the aquifer; and ecologically, such as in wetlands or at the river system scale. These linkages also shape institutions, which interact at all spatial scales, from individuals to governments. Social stratification, power relationships, trust, cultural beliefs, and cognitive biases strongly influence the way in which different social groups can (or not) alter, perceive, and adapt to hydrological change. These heterogeneous elements also determine how water governance unfolds and, in turn, how water is managed at different scales (Pahl-Wostl et al., 2013; Wei et al., 2017). As suggested by Zwarteveen et al. (2017), water governance is inherently political and concerns decisions on where and to whom water flows to and the institutions, norms, and beliefs underlying these decision-making processes (see also Wei et al., 2017). Moreover, humans are diverse, interpretive creatures who frequently disagree about values, means, and ends (Castree et al., 2014: p.765; Massuel et al., 2018; Hulme, 2010). Most phenomena discussed in section 2 can have a spatial component. For example, the pendulum swing manifested itself as a spatial process in the Kissimmee River basin in Florida (Chen et al., 2016). Severe flooding in the rural part of the catchment in the 1950s led to river training, which, however, degraded the local wetlands. The community in the urban part of the catchment valued the environment more than flood mitigation (as the latter did not concern them directly) resulting in river being remeandered and the wetlands being restored. The safe-development paradox, or levee effect, very often has a spatial component when the construction of polders upstream of the floodplains under risk is considered. The irrigation efficiency paradox or rebound effect often has a spatial component in transboundary river management when water use increases due to regional water transfers (Dell'Angelo et al., 2018; Müller et al., 2016). Socio-hydrological entities are interconnected in today's highly connected world. The space-time linkages are not only within each scale but also across scales and can lead to emergence of diverse phenomena such as large-scale droughts. Trade networks spread knowledge and can bring in sudden changes in land use policies such as rapid deforestation in the Amazon or even changes in how resources are governed. The understanding of dynamic patterns of interconnectedness through trade and the global hydrological cycle is therefore critical to the assessment of long-term water resource availability at global and local scales. This demands an extension of systems with endogenous human agency to space and to space-time. A natural extension is therefore to endogenize the boundary conditions themselves, for example, of trade or rainfall, just as sociohydrology has endogenized scenarios in the time domain, for example, of population growth, through bidirectional feedbacks. This requires us to understand additional processes that connect socio-hydrological entities in space, with the goal of explaining why aggregated, macroscopic behavior emerges from heterogeneous components. 3.2 Evaluating the Implications of the SDGs: Integrating Quantitative and Qualitative Data One scientific challenge in sociohydrology is integrating qualitative reporting and case studies to provide in-depth, context specific, critical descriptions of human-water interactions at different scales (Massuel et al., 2018; Mostert, 2018; Sexsmith & McMichael, 2015; Weststrate et al., 2018). This approach can contribute to widen the parameters used to examine the effectiveness of SDGs and ensure aspects related to human psychological, physical, and emotional well-being are taken into consideration. A second reason for integrating quantitative and qualitative data is to deepen the analysis of phenomena and processes that may enable or constrain the success of SDGs. This also entails critically examining the implementation of the water-related SDGs by questioning the underlying political, ideological, and economic logics. Several authors have warned that no long-term prosperity is possible without changes in the current economic system and that the new targets will not be effective if structural processes that perpetuate poverty are not addressed (Bello, 2013; Death & Gabay, 2015; Langford, 2016; Liverman, 2018). This interpretation shared by the UN report of the high-level panel of eminent persons on the post-2015 development, co-chaired by Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono (at the time President of Indonesia), Ellen Johnson Sirleaf (at the time President of Liberia), and David Cameron (at the time Prime Minister of the United Kingdom), recognizes that it is unrealistic to think we can help another one billion people to lift themselves out of poverty […] without making structural changes in the world economy and calls for new models (United Nations, UN, 2013: p.5). Vandemoortele (2011, p. 13), one of the architects of the Millennium Development Goals, claimed that they have been misappropriated to reaffirm the conventional view of development. SDGs need to propose a new vision and a new understanding of sustainability, economic growth, and the environment, recognizing that the global economy services society, which lies within Earth's life-support system (Griggs et al., 2013: 305; see also Bello, 2013). In other words, this requires a transformative change in the ways that economic development is conceived (sustainability) and financed (accountability and priority setting) and the benefits thereof are distributed (equity, Mawdsley, 2018; Mawdsley, 2017; Sexsmith & McMichael, 2015). A productive engagement between sociohydrology and critical resource geography may produce relevant insights on the relation between financial flows, power, and hydrological flows in the implementation of the water-related SDGs at different temporal and spatial scales, as well as on how the benefits and costs of these developments are distributed between societal groups and across spaces. In doing so, sociohydrology has the potential to contribute more effectively also to goals focusing on poverty (SDG 1) and equity (SDG 10). These examinations, we argue, require both integrating qualitative approaches alongside quantitative analyses and within modeling exercises to better understand the current socio-political, economic, and cultural contexts in different locations and how these contribute to co-shape SDG outcomes. Given its theoretical paradigm, sociohydrology is well positioned to play a catalytic role in integrating qualitative and quantitative data, yet this endeavor entails major scientific challenges. A first challenge in doing this is offered by different epistemologies, research strategies, and axiologies of qualitative and quantitative approaches (Mostert, 2018; Romagny & Cudennec, 2006; Wesselink et al., 2016). To preserve the richness and epistemological perspective of qualitative approaches, Mostert (2018) suggests developing case studies on the multiple ways in which humans alter hydrology in specific contexts and carefully selecting cases for comparative analysis and, possibly, for generalization of some patterns (see, for instance, Robinson, 2016). In their study on drinking water quality in the city of Lilongwe, Rusca, Boakye-Ansah, et al., 2017; Rusca, Alda-Vidal, et al., 2017) propose a case study design that accounts for both the complexity of the human dimension(s) and material and quantitative variables of the hydrological system. This approach allows retaining central themes of scholars in critical water studies and political ecology such as the role of ideology, power, class, gender, culture, and everyday practices in controlling and directing water flows in rural, urban, and regional landscapes and the uneven distribution of costs and benefits thereof (Alda-Vidal et al., 2018; Ekers & Loftus, 2008; Swyngedouw, 1997; Tiwale et al., 2018; Truelove, 2011; Truelove, 2016), and relating these to changes to the hydrological system. A second specific challenge with integrating quantitative and qualitative data concerns how to capture aspects that are (i) heterogeneous (i.e., diverse for different social groups), (ii) typically described in a qualitative way, and (iii) rarely collected in a systematic fashion. For instance, by looking at the five variables of the loop diagram presented earlier in Figure 3a, one can see that while some of these variables can be easily quantified and are often available as systematic time series (e.g., flooding, expressed as high water levels above a datum; Di Baldassarre, Viglione, et al., 2013,Di Baldassarre, Kooy, et al., 2013; Di Baldassarre et al., 2015), others are more qualitative and typically not systematically available over time (e.g., flood memory, expressed as the level of risk awareness in a community; Di Baldassarre, Viglione, et al., 2013; Di Baldassarre, Kooy, et al., 2013; Di Baldassarre et al., 2015). Moreover, flood memory is heterogeneously accumulated in different individuals or social groups, and these various individuals or social groups have different capacities to influence the decision-making process and to feed back on the hydrological system. In socio-hydrological modeling, the most common approach has been to turn qualitative information into quantitative using some proxies, such as flood insurance coverage as an analog of the level of flood risk awareness (Di Baldassarre et al., 2017), or using social media coverage, newspaper articles, or Google trends (Roby et al., 2018; Wei et al., 2017). Yet these short-cut methods raise numerous concerns, such as limited representativeness and their unavoidable inability to describe the heterogeneity of human society. Thus, there remains a need to better integrate social and hydrological sciences as well as qualitative and quantitative information for the study of human-water interactions. 3.3 Exploiting Socio-Hydrologic Understanding to Enable Improved IWRM Practice The advances expected to be made in socio-hydrologic understanding raises the question as to how these can help advance water management practice, notably IWRM, in the context of the UN SDGs. Sociohydrology can play a role in working toward societal water goals in two major ways. First, sociohydrology aims to provide scientific insights that can be used to inform IWRM. This is the detection and understanding of phenomena that exist in water resources management (see above; sections 2 and 3). Both sociohydrology and IWRM aim to help achieve SDGs (Figure 5), particularly the water-related targets highlighted in Figure 2. Second, sociohydrology is well-suited to scientifically evaluate the consequences of IWRM implementation. For example, sociohydrology can integrate understanding from the policy evaluation community (e.g., causal inference) to assess whether or not water management or policy had the intended outcome. In this way, sociohydrology and IWRM should strive to inform one another and learn from each other in a two way street of information exchange (see Figure 5). Figure 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Conceptual framing of the relationships between sociohydrology, Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM), and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Both sociohydrology and IWRM strive to achieve the SDGs. It is imperative that sociohydrology and IWRM communicate with each other and learn from one another to this end. As discussed in section 2, several emergent phenomena have been established through sociohydrology research. These phenomena have clear implications for IWRM. In Table 1, we map how a better understanding of socio-hydrological phenomena can provide useful insights to improve IWRM and help lead to desirable societal goals set forth by SDGs. For instance, through a better understanding of the rebound effect, we show that implementing drip irrigation alone will not lead to reduced water use, but, rather, may actually lead to increased water use. This means that IWRM should consider implementing counteracting measures, such as water basin use caps, along with irrigation efficiency technologies. It is essential to evaluate whether an IWRM intervention actually leads to the desired outcome. For example, does installing improved sanitation in a local community actually lead to reductions in waterborne diseases and diarrheal outbreaks? Sociohydrology can lead the way in evaluating whether or not IWRM interventions have the desirable impacts. Sociohydrology can do this through the adoption of novel techniques from the policy evaluation and econometrics fields. In fact, this increased interaction between sociohydrology and economics was recently called for by Müller and Levy (2019). The tools of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and causal inference using natural experiments in empirical information can be exploited to properly determine whether or not IWRM interventions are leading toward the desired societal goals or the SDGs. When possible, RCTs should be used to determine the outcome of an intervention. For example, to address the question about improved sanitation implementation discussed above, it would be best to install improved sanitation facilities randomly in some locations and not install them in others and then assess the outcomes (Null et al., 2018). The key is that the treatment (e.g., improved sanitation) must be randomly assigned in order to determine its causal impact on the societal outcome of interest (e.g., diarrhea). RCTs are the gold standard for assessing the impact of a treatment. For this reason, whenever possible, randomization of IWRM management techniques or interventions would be the preferred course of action. Unfortunately, it will often not be feasible to perform an RCT to evaluate IWRM action. This is because they are expensive, time consuming, and may sometimes be unethical. For this reason, exploiting naturally occurring data (i.e., nonexperimental) that has some attributes that can help us to distinguish that causal impact of the treatment on the outcome of interest is critical. This is the aim of causal inference in econometrics. Causal inference has recently been applied to understand how human interventions impact water resources, such as for crop insurance (Deryugina & Konar, 2017) and international trade (Dang & Konar, 2018). Going forward, it will be of continued importance for sociohydrology to employ causal inference tools to assess the performance of IWRM in helping us meet the SDGs. 3.4 Addressing a Societal Grand Challenge: Managing Trade-Offs Between SDGs and Overcoming Legacy Risks The water crises that humanity faces are increasingly multifaceted, complex, and intertwined. This is clearly reflected in the fact that many of the United Nations SDGs may affect or are affected by the quantity and quality of water resources (Figure 2). Linear and short-term approaches to fix one problem in isolation often trigger new problems. Failure to anticipate and comprehensively address emergent water-related risks of floods, droughts, and water-quality degradation holistically and inclusively can cause economic decline and can lead some communities into a poverty trap, an emergent phenomenon highlighted by Borgeomo et al. (2018) based on work in Bangladesh. This shows how, at a broader level, water management is intimately tied to SDG 1, which aims at eradicating poverty. Managing water-related issues comprehensively and holistically thus requires nontrivial decisions about what to prioritize (e.g., drinking vs sanitation vs food), who pays to address these issues and how much, how the benefits and the costs of these measures are distributed (rich vs poor, upstream vs downstream, and urban vs rural), and how to balance benefits and costs (economic vs environmental vs social). It is essential to fully integrate water resources management across the entire socio-hydrological cycle; different water users including engineering, economic, social, ecological, and legal aspects; and spatial scales, including, for example, upstream/downstream perspectives. While technical measures can work in the short term, the absent (or limited) involvement of society-at-large (i.e., the beneficiaries) often leads to adverse consequences such as resistance to (or nonacceptance of) introduced policies. Recognizing the nonlinear nature of human-water systems and pursuing broader and long-term perspectives are key steps to craft more robust decisions (Haasnoot et al., 2013) and tackle the current and future water challenges in a more sustainable way. Figure 6 illustrates, in a simple and schematized way, the variation over time of the performance in addressing societal challenges. It can be seen, for example, as a composite value of various indicators for the achievement of the SDGs. For the sake of simplicity, we consider only two of them (i) the real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita (SDG8, Indicator for target 1.1); and the extent of wetlands over time (SDG 6, Indicator for target 6.6). In Figure 6a, we see that Path 1 gets closer than Path 2 to the composite target by 2030, which is the year in which SDGs are expected to be achieved. A short-term approach would therefore favor policies associated with Path 1. However, Path 2 is more sustainable, and it is more effective than Path 1 in the longer term (Figure 6a). Figures 6b and 6c decompose these two paths and exemplify how short-term perspectives can become unsustainable in the long term. Path 1 relies on fast economic growth but with unsustainable environmental costs, that is, degradation of wetlands and aquifer depletion. In the long term, not only does this narrow approach prevent further growth but it also leads to increasing poverty (Figure 6b). Path 2, instead, is promoting economic growth but without compromising the environment, depleting water resources, and compromising future generations. In the long term, this broader approach results more sustainable (Figure 6c). Figure 6 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Addressing a societal grand challenge, for example, performance in achieving the SDGs. Conceptual drawings illustrating: (a) short-term (Path 1) versus long-term (Path 2) perspective. Path 1 gets closer than Path 2 to the composite target by 2030, which is the year in which SDGs are expected to be achieved, but Path 2 is more sustainable and more effective than Path 1 in the longer term. (b and c) Decompositions of Path 1 (short-term) and Path 2 (long-term) exemplifying how short-term perspectives can become unsustainable in the long term. Path 1 relies on fast economic growth but with unsustainable environmental costs, that is, degradation of wetlands and aquifer depletion. (d and e) Possibility space and decision trees for Path 1 (constrained) Path 2 (unconstrained). These two panels show that water policies and management decisions are typically updated over time (dots in the diagrams). The possibility space of Path 1 becomes constrained (Figure 6d) once that water resources are depleted, as environmental degradation and economic decline are essentially irreversible. The possibility space of Path 2 remains unconstrained (Figure 6e), that is, policy and decision makers can keep influencing the trajectory over time and therefore adjust and adapt to, for example, climatic and socio-economic changes. Indeed, all of the socio-hydrological phenomena discussed previously in section 2 can be seen as a legacy: the result of a coevolution between hydrological, technical, and social systems, which influence or constrain today's decision. As the past was a legacy to the present, the present is a legacy for the future. This implies that water policies and management decisions have a legacy risk. Short-term fixes based on linear thinking can have negative repercussion in the long term, which might be difficult, if not impossible, to reverse, that is, a lock-in condition. To cope with legacy risks, we need to look at future trajectories and exclude decisions that cannot be reversed, that is, not to constraining the future possibility space. Thus, understanding how the interactions and feedbacks between social, technical, and hydrological processes generate legacy in water management is crucial to reducing legacy risk. Figures 6d and 6e illustrate these concepts. Path 1 and Path 2 are represented using decision trees in the possibility space. This illustration reflects the fact that water policies and management decisions are typically updated over time. In the example of Figure 6d, the possibility space of Path 1 becomes constrained once that water resources are depleted, as environmental degradation and economic decline are essentially irreversible. Instead, the possibility space of Path 2 remains nonconstrained. Policy and decision makers can keep influencing the trajectory over time and therefore adjust and adapt to, for example, climatic and socio-economic changes. The concept of legacy risk ties in well with the precautionary principle. In its strongest formulation, the precautionary principle calls for absolute proof of safety before allowing new technologies to be adopted (Foster et al., 2000). It is an important component of much of the environmental legislation in the western world. The reasoning is similar to that of legacy risk, that is, to err on the side of least consequences. In fact, the concept of legacy risk can be interpreted as a dynamic version of the precautionary principle. When in doubt, the decisions we make must try to avoid those development paths that potentially have irreversible effects resulting from the types of phenomena discussed in this paper. The generalized understanding of phenomena that may lead to lock-in situations, be they economically, politically, culturally, or environmentally driven, will provide guidance as to what extent the principle should be weighed against quantitative evidence, cost-benefit analyses, and discretionary judgment. Work on time-space scale interactions, the opportunities of using both qualitative and quantitative information, and setting up a more integrated interdisciplinary collaboration process will help in making progress in understanding generalizable phenomena. The levee effect, supply-demand cycles, and the irrigation efficiency paradox are all reflections of coupled human-water processes that may or may not constrain future decision making. 4 Conclusions In this paper, we examined the role of sociohydrology in addressing the societal grand challenges posed by the SDGs. We argued that sociohydrology is an appropriate analytical framework to conceptualize and evaluate the water implications of the SDGs. First, sociohydrology can act as an interface between the SDGs and IWRM principles. In conceptualizing water challenges, sociohydrology considers socio-cultural and socio-political dimensions as well as short-term and long-term impacts of water governance processes. As such, it provides both actionable and generalizable insights on short- and long-term impacts of the strategies adopted to meet the SDGs targets. Second, sociohydrology has focused on the explanation of a wide range of phenomena that may enable or constrain the success of water-related SDGs. There is considerable scope for applying these insights to strategies developed by different countries to meet the SDGs. Last, in the coming years sociohydrology will critically examine the implementation of the water-related SDGs to monitor their short- and long-term sustainability. Concurrently, the paper identified a series of research directions to further sociohydrology and enhance its contribution to the SDGs. We propose a research agenda that widens the range of phenomena—including water pollution and health-related challenges, the water-food-energy nexus, and transboundary water governance—and explores and tests innovative methodologies to trace water-society interactions at different temporal and spatial scales. To achieve the United Nations SDGs, there is a need to (i) capture the complex, multifaceted nature of human-water systems and (ii) explore long-term dynamics associated with alternative policies. These two aspects have been the very essence of socio-hydrological research over the past 6 years. However, it is no longer adequate to investigate, after the fact, the causes of water crises in different contexts and frame them theoretically as the unintended consequences of water resources management or governance. Increasingly, sociohydrology must aspire to assist communities involved in IWRM to frame water-related issues in broader terms and develop models capable of generating likely alternative futures under various policy options (Bai et al., 2016). This will empower communities, and in particular the IWRM community, to make more informed decisions for sustainable development and management of water resources. This requires a broadening of the theoretical foundations and methodological diversity of sociohydrology, going beyond individual phenomena, and toward mapping out the safe operating space for humanity to manage their water resources sustainably. By being open to face up to these scientific challenges, sociohydrology is well placed to help communities to meet the SDGs, the societal grand challenge of our time.

Changes will occur to the way people live as technology involves people's lives and information processing is fully integrated into their daily living activities and objects. The future expectation of smart buildings includes making the residents' experience as easy and comfortable as possible. The massive streaming data generated and captured by smart building appliances and devices contain valuable information that needs to be mined to facilitate timely actions and better decision making. Machine learning and big data analytics will undoubtedly play a critical role to enable the delivery of such smart services. In this paper, we survey the area of smart building with a special focus on the role of techniques from machine learning and big data analytics. This survey also reviews the current trends and challenges faced in the development of smart building services. The major machine learning tasks that are relevant to smart buildings include: data collection and acquisition, data pre-processing, and dimensionality reduction.

Introduction Although the term “smart building” (SB) may bring a thought of a fictional smart space from science-fiction movies, but the reality is that SBs exist today, and their number is getting increased. With recent advances in machine learning (ML), big data analytics, sensor technologies and the Internet of Things (IoT), regular buildings can be cost-effectively transformed into SBs with bare minimum infrastructural modifications. There are smart office, smart library, smart home, smart health care facilities, smart hospital and many other types of SBs that can provide automated services that can provide many value-added services (such as reduction of wasted energy) and also help to ensure the comfort, health, and safety of the occupants. The hyperconnectivity that will be brought about by the emergence of IoT will increase the promise of SB since now all the basic building amenities and commodities ranging from your house electronics to your plant vases will be interconnected. But this hyperconnectivity will at the same time complicate the process of managing SBs. In particular, SBs and their inhabitants are expected to create large volumes of streaming data. ML, sampling, compression, learning, and filtering technologies are becoming more significant to manage the stream of big data of individuals. In 1981, the term Intelligent Buildings (IBs) was initially coined by United Technology Building Systems (UTBS) Corporation in the U.S. In July 1983, IBs became a reality with the opening of the City Place Building in Hartford, Connecticut [1]. Today, the number of SBs is growing at an unprecedented rate including smart office, smart hospitality, smart educational facilities etc. [2]. An SB is recognized as an integrated system that takes advantage of a range of computational and communications infrastructure and techniques [3]. Examples of SB services include smart thermostats that allow the temperature to be controlled based on the time of the day/year and the users’ preferences with minimal or no manual configuration. Using data analytics to “learn” the users’ preferences before taking the appropriate actions is probably the most important enabling technology for IBs [4]. Lately, smart coffee machines appeared in the market with the capability to make coffee automatically, according to users’ preferences and schedules. Fridges can offer allocated programming interfaces for their control [5]. IBs aim to provide their users with safe, energy efficient, environment-friendly, and convenient services. In order to maximize comfort, minimize cost, and adapt to the needs of their inhabitants, SBs must rely on sophisticated tools to learn, predict, and make intelligent decisions. SB algorithms cover a range of technologies, including prediction, decision-making, robotics, smart materials, wireless sensor networks, multimedia, mobile computing, and cloud computing. With these technologies, buildings can cognitively manage many SB services such as security, privacy, energy efficiency, lighting, maintenance, elderly care, and multimedia entertainment. The massive volume of sensory data collected from sensors and appliances must be analyzed by algorithms, transformed into information, and minted to extract knowledge so that machines can have a better understanding of humans than their environment. Furthermore, and most importantly, such knowledge can lead to new products and services that can dramatically transform our lives. For example, readings from smart meters can be used to better predict and balancing the usage of power. Monitoring and processing sensory data from wearable sensors attached to patients can produce new remote healthcare services. The main philosophy behind ML is to create the analytical models automatically in order to permit the algorithms to learn continuously from available data. The application of ML techniques increased over the last two decades due to the availability of massive amounts of complex data and the increased usability of current ML tools. Today, ML is already widely applied in different applications including recommendation systems offered by online services (e.g., Amazon, Netflix) and automatic credit rating services used by banks. Alphabet’s Nest thermostat utilizes ML to “learn” the temperature preferences of its users and adapt to their work schedule to minimize the energy use. Other widely publicized examples of ML applications include Google’s self-driving car, sentiment analysis of Amazon and Twitter data, fraud detection, and Facebook’s facial-recognition technology that is used to tag the suggested person on images uploaded by users. A. SB Trends and Market Impact In this section, we look at the statistics related to SBs, to allow us to understand the current trends and motivations in industry marketplaces and academic researches toward SBs. According to the report by MarketsandMarkets [6], The SB market is estimated to grow from 7.42 billion dollars in 2017 to 31.74 billion dollars by 2022, at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 33.7% from 2017 to 2022. In yet another report Zion Market Research [7], 2016 and it is expected to reach 61,900 million dollars by 2024. It is expected to exhibit a CAGR of more than 34% between 2017 and 2024. The market is primarily driven by government initiatives globally for SB projects and the increasing market for integrated security and safety systems as well as energy efficient building systems. Figure 1 shows the Statista [8] forecast market size of the global smart home market from 2016 to 2022 (in billion U.S. dollars). FIGURE 1. Forecast market size of the global smart home market from 2016 to 2022 [8]. Show All According to the Gartner report [9], it is expected that the number of smart connected homes grows to 700 million homes by 2020, supplied by mass consumer adoption and an increase in the number of devices and apps available. Figure 2 shows Gartner’s 2018 Hype Cycle expectation for deep learning, ML, connected homes, and smart workspace. FIGURE 2. Hype Cycle for the Connected Home, 2018 [7]. Show All According to report by Research and Markets [10], [11], the global IoT SB market will reach approximately $51.44B USD globally by 2023. The report also forecast that 33% of IoT SB market will be supplied by artificial intelligent technologies by 2023, and automation systems of SB will grow at 48.3% CAGR from 2018–2023. Frost & Sullivan also predict that by 2025, the growth of connected home living will reach 3.7 billion smartphones, 700 million tablets, 520 million wearable health-related devices and 410 million smart appliances in the connected person world. B. Related Survey Papers Although many of survey papers focused on SBs have been published, none of them is focused on the role of data analytics and ML in the context of SBs. We describe the relevant survey papers next and will compare these survey papers to our paper in Table 2. Chan et al. in 2008 provided an overview of smart home research [12].

Section VI highlights research and development challenges and provides a future perspective of SB projects. Finally, Section VII presents a summary of lessons learned and concludes the paper. For the convenience of the readers, we have enlisted the important acronyms used in Table 1. SECTION II. Smart Buildings: Concept and Architecture In 1984, The New York Times published an article that described that real estate developers are creating “a new generation of buildings that almost think for themselves called intelligent buildings.” Such an intelligent building (IB) was defined as “a marriage of two technologies - old-fashioned building management and telecommunications.” [23]. Since then, many definitions of SBs have been suggested. This is due to the fact that the life-cycle of building planning, design, implementation, and operation involves different industry players that have different roles. In addition, the rapid changes in technology are affecting this definition. For instance, the advent of IoT and smart city concepts is impacting the definition of SB. Therefore, it is hard to compose a unique view of IBs with a single definition that is accepted worldwide. However, it is vital to have a good understanding of the main standard bodies and companies involved in shaping the development of SBs [1]. The Institute for Building Efficiency [24] focuses on the operation of buildings to provide efficient healthy and comfortable environment [25]. IBM [26] focuses also on the operation of SBs to provide integrated physical and digital infrastructures that provide reliable, sustainable, and cost-effective occupancy services. According to the European Commission’s Information Society [27], SBs means buildings that are supplied by information and communication technologies in the context of the combining Ubiquitous Computing and the IoT: In general, the buildings that are supplied with sensors, actuators, microchips, micro- and nano-embedded systems in order to enable collecting, filtering and producing more information locally, to be further incorporated and managed globally according to business functions.” In SBs, a variety of AI and multi-agent system techniques are employed including [28]: Reasoning and knowledge representation including ontologies and rules to represent devices and building services. ML for human activity recognition. Multi-agent systems for distributed intelligence and semantic interoperability. Intelligent approaches such as planning, intelligent control, adaptive interfaces, and optimization for efficient management of resources and services. An SB is therefore the integration of a wide range of systems and services into a unified environment that involve energy management systems, temperature monitoring systems, access security systems, fire and life safety, lighting control and reduction, telecommunications services, office automation, computer systems, area locating systems, LANs, management information systems, cabling and records, maintenance systems, and expert systems [29]. Figure 3 shows examples of SB appliances including air-conditioning systems, lighting systems, solar energy generators, power-supply systems, temperature sensors, humidity sensors, power usage sensors, and surveillance cameras. For example, centralized control of these elements can promote the efficient use of energy through the intelligent control of lights and air conditioning units and the intelligent management of multiple green and brown energy sources. In most cases, an SB uses an Ethernet backbone with bridges to a Controller Area Network (CAN) [26]. FIGURE 3. Example of SB appliances. Show All It is easier to introduce smart services in residential buildings compared to commercial buildings since residential buildings have less technical equipment and less stringent efficiency requirements. Because the commercial buildings usually have more public visitors and therefore building models for commercial buildings are usually more challenging than building models for residential buildings which usually have a limited number of the occupants most of the time. In addition, the costs associated with the purchase and installation of smart devices and infrastructure at commercial buildings is more than residential buildings. Figure 4 shows an integrated framework in a residential building that employs a network of intelligent sensors. These sensors control systems such as energy generation, metering, HVAC, lighting, and security. A building automation system manages a set of smart appliances, sensors, and actuators, which collectively deliver services for the well-being of the inhabitants. Examples of such smart appliances, sensors, and actuators include washers and dryers, refrigerators, heaters, thermostats, lighting systems, power outlets, energy meters, smoke detectors, televisions, game consoles, windows/door controllers and sensors, air conditioners, video cameras, and sound detectors. More advanced smart devices are constantly being developed like smart floors and smart furniture [28], [30]. FIGURE 4. Smart appliances, sensors, and actuators in a smart residential building. Show All The IoT will enable the integration and interoperability of heterogeneous devices in SBs as well as the real-time processing of the data generated by sensors in support of optimal control and operation of the building. In this paper, We propose a layered architecture for SBs based on the layered architecture of IoT. Figure 5 shows the layered architecture of SBs. FIGURE 5. Layers of the base IoT architecture that serves as the foundation for SBs. Show All As can be seen from the sensing layer (the bottom layer in Figure 5), input data is obtained from different types of physical sensors that monitor environmental parameters, collect data about residents and detect anomalies (e.g., fire and water pipe bursts). This layer also includes actuators that can be controlled to save energy, minimize water consumption, etc. The network layer (the second layer in Figure 5), includes access and core networks that provide transparent data transmission capability. This layer serves as a bridge between the sensing layer and the upper layers which are mainly responsible for data processing. An intermediary software layer called the middleware layer is needed (the third layer in Figure 5) to provide seamless integration of heterogeneous devices and networks covered by the sensing layer of the architecture. That layer serves as a bridge between the embedded software that runs of smart sensors and back-end software services. This layer provides interoperability using standardized programming interfaces and protocols [31]. Therefore, this layer performs the process of converting the collected data from various data formats into a common representation. SB middleware can be based on open standards or proprietary, in addition, application-specific or general-purpose. Most often, proprietary middleware is application-specific while general-purpose middleware is based on open standards [28]. The context and semantic discovery layer (the fourth layer in Figure 5) is responsible for managing context and semantic discoverers including context and semantics generating, configuring, and storing. The processing and reasoning layer (the fifth layer in Figure 5) is responsible for processing the extracted information from the middleware then according to the application’s type it will make decisions. In this layer, there are various techniques of information processing applied to fuse, extract, contextualize. massive data into useful actionable knowledge. In this layer, two phases should be identified: context consumer and context producer of the middleware. In the context consumer phase, the data processing techniques are applied on the data produced by the middleware; while in context producer phase the process of decision-making is implemented to supply the service layer with valuable knowledge. while in the second stage, further context information can be provided to the middleware for registration in the ontology context. Specific services and applications are abstracted in the application layer (the top-most layer in Figure 5). This layer presents a framework with direct access to the underlying functionalities to serve in the implementation of various types of applications. Moreover, control panels should be installed in the building to control the automated indoor spaces and to support a local human-machine interface. For instance, in a multi-story building, each floor could have a control panel to automate the operations, such as control opening the windows, control of air conditioning to achieve the desired temperature, control close/open the blinds according to the preferred light intensity before using artificial lighting [32], [33]. Summary: Still there is no single standard definition for SBs. In this section, we reviewed many definitions for SBs by many institutes, counties, regions and different disciplines; each has their own definition for SBs. We presented the layered architectural pattern for adapting services in an SB environment. We wanted to provide a general design for adapting actions according to the different versions of context in SBs. This architecture may be used in different smart environments such as intelligent transport systems, security, health assistance, and SBs among others. We layered the architecture into six layers starting from the sensing layer, which includes various types of sensors that are installed to collect environmental information in SBs. While network layer providing data stream support and data flow control and ensuring that messages arrive reliably by using data transport protocols such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Ethernet etc. Data Acquisition layer to collect the data from the heterogeneous sources of data. Context and semantic discovery layer to generate, configure, and store context and semantic information. Context processing and reasoning layer to process the information and extract the knowledge that making the decisions according to the application context. And the last layer which is application layer such as health assistance and elderly home care, comfort and entertainment services, security, tele-management, smart watering, energy efficiency, etc. After discussing the main components of commercial and residential buildings, we have now set the stage for a detailed discussion on the components of SBs in the next section. SECTION III. Smart Building Components Advances in smart building technology have driven to the extensive development of SBs to generate economic and environmental benefits for building owners through the convergence of IT and building automation systems. Figure 6 shows the key components of SB systems, these include extensive sensors and actuators systems, networking and communication systems, software platform system, HVAC system, and smart control devices. FIGURE 6. Components of smart buildings. Show All Current systems utilize control devices and smart sensors that are connected to a central system. These control devices and smart sensors are placed throughout the environment. Each particular system has its own collection of networking and communication systems that enable it to communicate with the central system. SBs are performing connected networks that serve as a communication backbone for multiple systems. In many ways, HVAC equipment is the most complicated building system, with numerous components arranged to produce heating, cooling, and ventilation. The functionality of HVAC system not only makes the building healthy and comfortable for its inhabitants, but it also manages a big part of the energy consumed, as well as plays a significant role in life safety. SBs adopt technology to monitor and control facility systems and perform any required modifications. The objective of an SB is to utilize computers and software to control lighting, alarm systems, HVAC, and other systems through a single computer interface. A. Sensors and Actuators for SBs Sensors and actuators are mechanical components that measure and control the environmental values of their environment. Sensors collect information from the environment and make it ready for the system. For instance, IR sensors can be utilized for human presence detection in a room. While actuator is a device to convert an electrical control signal to a physical action, such that it takes decisions and then performs proper actions according to the environment, which enables automated and remote interaction with the environment.For example, a light actuator is capable of switching on/off, dimming one or more electric lights [34]. The rapid development of micromechanics, microelectronics, integrated optics, and other related technologies has facilitated the development of different types of smart sensors integrated into daily objects and infrastructure at smart building environment or worn by the users, and are connected by network technologies in order to collect contextual information about daily living activities more efficiently and faster, with lower energy consumption and less processing resources. Environmental sensors are utilized for detecting the human activity of a specific object that performed in specific locations in the building, while wearable sensors are utilized for controlling and observing mobile activities and physiological signals [35]. 1) Environmental Sensors It is found that data collected from environmental sensors can form important information to monitor human behaviors within an SB. These sensory data are then analyzed to identify and observe basic and instrumental daily living activities made by occupants such as bathing, dressing, preparing a meal, taking medication etc. The environmental sensing is generally based on several simple binary sensors in every part of the home, RFID technology, and video cameras. This variety of sensing may implement important insight into contexts and actual activities although it might come with possible costs such as complexity. Motion sensors are utilized for detecting the occupant’s presence and location everywhere in the house. There are different types of motion sensors. IR presence sensor is one of the most utilized kind of motion sensors in SBs to detect occupants’ presence. Pressure sensors can be attached to the objects such as beds, chairs, sofas, and floors in order to track the actions and locations of the occupants. While Contact switches are usually placed on the doors of fridge, rooms, or cabinets to detect the actions that the occupant makes with these objects [36]. Light sensors, humidity sensors, temperature sensors, or power sensors are other types of sensors that are deployed and utilized in SB to recognize the activities. Light sensors are utilized to measure the light intensity in a particular room in the building. Humidity sensors are utilized to detect the air humidity of a specific location in the building. Temperature sensors are utilized to measure the temperature of the specific environment. while the power sensors are utilized to identify the power usage of electric devices. 2) Wearable Sensors and Biosensors These sensors are attached directly or indirectly to the user body. Their small size enables these sensors to be attached to clothes, wristwatches, glasses, belts, shoes etc. These sensors can be categorized into inertial sensors and vital sign sensors (or biosensors). Wearable inertial sensors are highly transportable and no stationary units that can give accurately detailed features of occupant’s action and body posture. Those sensors are composed of accelerometers, gyroscopes and magnetic sensors. There is a need for receivers and cameras in the process of data collection, therefore can be used outside laboratory circumstances [37]. Wearable biosensors such as blood pressure, skin temperature, and heart rate are significant for collecting vital signs to monitor the health. The most commonly utilized inertial sensors for mobile activity monitoring are accelerometers and gyroscopes. Accelerometers can be utilized to measure the rate of acceleration accompanying a sensitive axis, they are useful to monitor the motion’s activities such as doing exercise, standing, sitting, walking, or walking upstairs and downstairs. While the gyroscopes can be utilized to measure angular velocity and maintain orientation. Some examples of primary vital signs are Electrocardiogram (ECG), heart rate, blood pressure, blood glucose, oxygen saturation, and respiratory rate. There are various vital sign sensor utilized to measure different vital signals such as Electroencephalography sensors (EEG) for observing electrical brain activity, Electrooculography sensors (EOG) for observing eye movement in ocular activity, Electromyography sensors (EMG) for observing muscle activity. Electrocardiography sensors (ECG) for observing cardiac activity, pressure sensors for observing blood pressure, CO2 gas sensors for observing respiration, thermal sensors for observing body temperature and galvanic skin response for observing skin sweating [38], [39]. 3) Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) HVAC system plays an essential role in SB services. HVAC system plays a remarkable role in efficient energy consumption in SBs, as well as it offers new operating options to increase the occupants’ comfort. In addition to meeting the desired temperature, HVAC control systems are produced in order to sustain comfort within an enclosed space by producing a specific level of humidity, pressure, air motion, and air quality in an SB [40]. CO2, humidity and temperature levels in a building can affect occupant’s health and comfort; consequently measuring CO2, humidity, and temperature in this context can improve personal wellbeing [41]. Heating and cooling systems consume a huge amount of energy in the buildings, so it is necessary to optimize it utilizing smart controllers and sensors in order to save operational costs. Smart HVAC systems can sense and control efficiently different air quality parameters inside the building by utilizing distributed sensors and VAV fans throughout the building to perform an optimal ventilation [42]. Most of the current HVAC actuation systems in smart buildings are based on the data collected about the occupants using sensors and cameras, which are utilized specifically for HVAC systems. Certainly, There is a specific cost for the design, maintenance, setup and hardware of the data collection network [43]. Table 3 shows a summary for different types of smart sensors in the SBs. TABLE 3 Various Smart Sensors Useful in the Context of SBs B. Smart Control Devices Smart control devices collect data from a variety of sensors, process this data, and activate actuators to react to the events detected by the sensors. A smart control device can operate independently, without control by a central server. But there might be a needed communication amongst various control devices or they can connect with each other using the smart gateway. WeMo [44] is a Wi-Fi enabled switch utilized to turn electronic devices on/off from anywhere. It can control LED motion sensors, light bulbs, mart wall switches and plugs, and lighting devices, all from the smartphone app or browser. There is no hub needed for WeMo devices, everything can be managed through the free cloud service provided by Belkin. You can use the specific channel to connect the device to e-services such as Gmail to trigger specific actions. WeMo devices also support context-aware feature, it turns on/off automatically according to the time of day, whether it is sunrise or sunset etc. The Nest thermostat [45], a smart device developed by Nest—which has been acquired by Google—adjusts to your life and seasons change automatically. Just use it for a week and it programs itself. It learns about the level of temperatures that the occupants prefer and creates a context-aware personalized schedule. The smart thermostat turns to an energy-efficient mode automatically when the residents leave the building. It could start warming up the area when it senses activity, such as an occupant’s returning back home from work. The Nest Thermostat is controllable via a smartphone and an installed app. If you are away for a while, this device has also a capability to sustain a particular temperature in your house. Lockitron [46] is a door lock that can control the door remotely over the Internet to open and close it by phone. Lockitron app can be installed and used by any iOS or Android smartphone. Homeowners can directly grant family and friends the access to open a given door by providing authorization over the Internet. Lockitron can also utilize Bluetooth low energy technology, which means that it will keep controlling even in the event of Internet or power outages. Lockitron can also connect to the Internet with Bridge, through which occupants can control the bolt anywhere in the world. The SmartThings [47] SB automation system comprised of a communications smart hub, that supports various smart appliances and devices; the smart hub supports various technologies and protocols such as ZigBee, Z-Wave, as well as IP-accessible devices and lets you control appliances using Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity. SmartThings provides kits that include smart plugs, in addition, the basic sensors that can be utilized to measure temperature, as well as to detect presence, motion, orientation, and vibration. SmartThings also includes an open platform that enables smart device vendors and third-party software to provide hardware and software that can be utilized alongside the platform. Philips Hue [48] is a combination of LED lighting with mobile technology. An accompanying mobile app that allows you to control lighting systems and changing color sets depending on your mood utilizing Wi-Fi technology. The new Philips Hue bridge supports the required authentication to enable Apple HomeKit technology to control and enable your Philips Hue to connect to other HomeKit enabled accessories and take control of your home. Blufitbottle [49] this bottle records the drinking habits of the users and sends them notifications about the time and amount of the water that they are supposed to drink to keep them healthy and hydrated. The app collects data about users such as their weight and age, plus other factors such as the current levels of temperature and humidity to estimate the amount of the needed water to keep them hydrated. When the user falls behind with hydration, an alert sounds, as well as a simple glance from the LEDs, will indicate when it’s time for the next drink. Canary [50] is an all-in-one home security system that comprises a set of sensors such as temperature, air quality, sound, motion vibration, in addition, an HD video camera in one unit. The system utilizes ML algorithms to let the users know what is happening at home and take action by sending notifications to your phone if something happens. Those ML models learn over time and send the users smarter notifications as it detects motion. So that, the longer you have the system, the more effective it becomes. Canary is able to decrease the rate of false alarms by learning the user behavior and the ambient noise level and the home temperature patterns. Amazon Echo [51] is a small cylinder enable the users to control anything in the home via the voice. Amazon Echo has a powerful voice recognition capability, the user does not have to worry about the complexities of their voice. Amazon Echo is connectable via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, the users can send voice commands to control the speakers as well as other compatible devices such as Belkin’s WeMo and Philips Hue. It can also use Amazon cloud Lambda service to send commands. To send any command It requires to include the name of the program, for instance, “Alexa, turn on TV”. It also includes a network to distant servers, which slows down the response time. Honeywell Total Connect Remote Services [52] this device merges personal smart home automation with security monitoring task. It enables the occupants to control and monitor everything in the home from lighting and window shades systems to security cameras and smoke alarms. the user can utilize a smartphone app or desktop-mounted hardware console for controlling and monitoring. It can provide real-time alerts, GPS vehicle and asset tracking, video viewing, and mobile control. The system only supports Z-Wave devices, it needs to be installed by an authorized Honeywell dealer. It does not work with Wi-Fi enabled smart thermostats. In addition, the Honeywell provides security cameras and sensors, it also supports other smart devices from third parties, such as Yale locks and Lutron lighting. Table 4 shows a comparison among various smart control devices in the SBs. TABLE 4 Comparison Among Various Smart Control Devices in SB C. Networking and Home Gateway An SB combines a communication network in order to control smart devices and services within the building. The communication network of a smart building can be based on diverse communication media such as twisted pair cable, as the traditional computer networks. The networking in building automation system has a tendency to utilize a heterogeneous network that is made up of diverse communication media and network standards. The building automation network is identified by physical technology and communication protocols. There is an internal network that connects devices inside the building, as well as the external networks, can be integrated separately. Public Internet, ISDN, and mobile phone networks are some examples of external networks [28], [53]. A typical SB may comprise a number of different components, such as sensors, actuators, communication and processing devices. Because of their nature, these components have limited capabilities and computational capacity in term of battery capacity and capability of data processing. To deal with this issue, most of the SB systems have been utilized as a central gateway to collect, process, and analyze context data from different sensors and actuators in the building. Several protocols such as Bluetooth, ZigBee, Wi-Fi, and Z-wave can be utilized for communicating the gateway. The home gateway can also collect and store data for a specific time period. Typically, these gateways can connect to the cloud services and perform data processing and reasoning tasks. The centralized gateway usually does not have any interface. They can be controlled and managed utilizing smartphones, tablets, or computers [54], [55]. In general, depending on the communication media used, SB network technology can be classified by interconnection method into three main types: Powerline, Busline, and Wireless [15], [56], which we describe next. 1) Powerline Communication (PLC) PLC method reuses the building electrical network; such that devices, appliances, and services are directly connected to the main power supply utilizing the already available electrical outlets in a building. The data is sent through the normal cable system to activate or deactivate the devices in the building. PLC system is historically the oldest technology in SB and is generally cheap but less reliable and scalable [3]. Originally, the application of PLC was mainly to secure the typical operation of the electric power supply system in case of failures or breakdowns through the direct exchange of information between the distribution center, and power plant. Therefore, this approach has become a competitive choice for SB networking, benefiting from availability, robustness, and ready connectivity of this method. Some of the protocols of this method offer a single-way communication, which enables the device to only receive information but not to communicate. There are different mainstream protocols of PLC method such as X-10, INSTEON, HomePlug, BACnet, and Lonworks. 2) Busline Busline systems in SBs networks use a separate physical media, usually twisted-pair cabling similar to the physical cables utilized for network services for transporting electrical signals. This type of systems is pleasant the building’s occupants, albeit the configuration process is complex, and it requires some knowledge of networking. Although the configuring complexity and installation cost of this system, the use of a separate cable could present a positive note about this approach, as it allows this method of networking to provide higher bandwidth, and to make it the most reliable of the three approaches. In addition, this technology usually supports a completed two-way communication protocol that enables the appliances to easily communicate with each other [57]. Some of the protocols in Busline technology are Konnex (KNX), CAN (Controller Area Network), Modbus, Meter-Bus (M-Bus). 3) Wireless Interconnection Many of the new SB applications use wireless technologies such as infrared and radio frequency, which are more convenient for users due to their untethered nature and the elimination of cables. The devices within the smart building can communicate wirelessly as radio wave can penetrate through floors, cabinets, and walls [56]. Because of the complexity and cost of potential modifications and of the re-wiring process in a smart building, several different wireless technologies are rising to produce flexible networking patterns convenient to occupants without taking to consider the physical wiring and deployment of such wire in the building. Typically, there are various protocols for the wireless system such as Bluetooth, ZigBee, WLAN, Z-wave, RFID etc., which essentially work in the industrial scientific medical bands, particularly in the 2.4GHz frequency range. These wireless technologies are usually related to some control network concept in an SB such as low power consumption, high cost-effectiveness, low speed, flexibility in networking, deployment as well as building coverage [3]. The gateway is the central server of an SB that is commonly used in IoT solutions. The services provided by the gateway essentially concern to system management functionalities such as monitoring, controlling, and configuring the systems and their devices. It also supports some processing and data storage capabilities required for complex applications. D. Software Platform For a building to be “smart,” it is important that all the appliances and systems in the building communicate and exchange data securely with each other as well as with smartphones, tablets, and servers in the cloud. Software platforms play a critical role in exchanging, archiving and disseminating information through different protocols. These platforms use push, pull, publish/subscribe, etc. The goal of the joint commercial enterprises is to develop an open source software platform in order to make the process of data exchanging easier between the devices of different manufacturers. Therefore, the users will not have to worry in the future about the compatibility issues when utilizing electric and electronic devices of different manufacturers at home. In addition, the new platform can also offer a variety of different building services such as entertainment, energy efficiency, and security technology. Hence, this will enable creating different apps for these areas of use [58]. ABB, Robert Bosch GmbH, and Cisco Systems Inc. established an open-software platform called Mozaiq Operations GmbH [59] to unify smart building technology and offer interoperability across for all devices and services in the building, to simplify the experience for residents. It will enable users to seamlessly and intuitively customize their appliances and devices, regardless of manufacturers and brands of these devices, in order to improve energy efficiency and achieve a unique level of control and comfort. For instance, the user can close the blinds in the home either by a click from a smartphone or through a pre-set instruction; and switch off automatically all screen devices for the children to go outside to play. In a smart building, many devices and appliances can simply and securely share information with one another and with smartphones and other smart devices; and the Internet in general. Indigo Domotics [60] is to implement the do-it-yourself smart building platform. Indigo home automation software controllers available for the Mac OS enables residents to combine an array of common INSTEON, Z-Wave and X10 devices for unparalleled control of your building lighting, sensors, thermostats, and appliances. With Indigo Touch (sold through iTunes app store, iOS only), users will easily achieve remote control of their appliances utilizing an iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch. They also can use a web browser on any device to control their appliances virtually anywhere in the world. The users can receive texts or emails about specific events has been detected for doors opening/closing, power failures etc. Indigo, from Perceptive Automation, is the newest home automation software for the Mac. OpenHAB [61] is an open-source software platform that follows a middleware approach for integrating different technologies in smart building systems into a single solution. OpenHAB platform address a variety of network technologies and appliances in the area of a smart building. Currently, the dependency on a particular vendor becomes a problem due to the lack of a common language that bridges the different devices with building automation system. The main goal of the OpenHAB platform is to integrate the new devices and technologies in a smart building system through a community-based approach. OpenHAB utilizes an OSGi based modular system for communicating between different technologies and devices. Bindings can be developed and deployed as an OSGi bundle to bridge a particular technology and device. There are different supported technologies exist such as EnOcean, KNX, Z-Wave, and others are supported through special bindings [62]. SmartThings [47] this platform composed of hardware devices, sensors, and software applications. Context information is collected from the sensors, this context is contributed to the reasoning and action that are performed by the application. For instance, the sprinkler in the garden can detect the rain, and switch itself off accordingly to save water. SmartThings kit comprises sensors, smart devices, and hub. While the SmartThings application is configured to enable users to control and monitor their building environment through a smartphone device. The SmartThings Hub works to connect the sensors, devices and building’s internet router to one another and to the cloud. It is compatible with different communication protocols such as Zigbee, Z-Wave, and IP-accessible devices. In addition, the SmartThings is compatible with other sensors and devices such as thermostats, moisture sensors, motion sensors, presence sensors, locks and garage door openers [63]. HomeOS [64] is Microsoft’s home operating system platform, that can be installed on a personal computer. It is an open platform that is not limited to Windows-based devices [65], [66]. with HomeOS platform, applications can be installed to maintain various context-aware functionalities, for example, taking an image by a door camera and sending it to the occupant when someone rings the doorbell. HomeOS provides a PC-like abstraction that manages and extends the technology of network devices to the users and developers in the smart building environment. Its design enables the users to map their protocol-independent services to support the applications with simple APIs, a kernel, and protocols of specific devices. HomeOS usually runs on an allocated computer such as a home gateway, it does not need any adjustments to commodity devices. HomeOS usually utilizes (i) Datalog-based access control to facilitate the process of managing technology in the smart home (ii) a kernel to incorporate the devices and applications and (iii) protocol-independent services to allow the developers manageable access to the devices. Lab of Things (LoT) [67], [68] is an experimental research platform that utilizes connected devices in the buildings. LoT offers a framework that provides deployment capabilities such as remote monitoring and updating of system health, and logging data collected from different appliances in cloud storage. It enables data sharing and collecting, sharing codes, connect hardware sensors to the software platform, and participants using HomeOS. The platform is designed to make it simple to design solutions that can be deployed in IoT based smart services such as healthcare, energy management services as it works in combination with HomeOS. Eclipse Smarthome [69] is a framework that has a focus on heterogeneous environments such as smart building and ambient assisted living. This platform takes to consider a variety of existing communication mechanisms. Eclipse SmartHome works as an abstraction and translation framework that enables communications across system and protocol boundaries. It provides many relevant implemented extensions, protocols, and standards that are significant for smart building services. Those implementations can be of Java library or an OSGi bundle shapes so that they can be utilized independently from the rest of the project. The framework can work on different embedded devices such as a BeagleBone Black, an Intel Edison, or a Raspberry Pi. Extensions of Eclipse SmartHome are compatible with the solutions provided by different vendors. This means your code that is written for a specific purpose can be extended easily on commercial platforms. Eclipse SmartHome offers a variety of characteristics to allow you to design a special Smart Home solution for your expectations [70]. Apart from discussing various SB solutions, we will also highlight the popular simulator called Cooja is used widely by the research community to produce small simulations for relatively large wireless networks of embedding sensors and actuators; and connected devices, in order to develop, debug and evaluate systems based on the wireless sensor network technology. Cooja simulator is a Java-based wireless sensor network simulator. It is distributed with Contiki OS project. Cooja enables the emulation of the set of sensor nodes, in addition, it can simulate physical and application layers of the system [71]. There are three basic properties for the simulated node in Cooja: Its hardware peripherals, node type, and data memory. The node type can be shared among multiple nodes and defines properties that are common to all these nodes [72]. Summary: The field of SBs contains a variety of technologies, across commercial, industrial, institutional and domestic buildings, including building controls and energy management systems. Several organizations and institutions are working to supply buildings with technology that enables the residents to adopt a single device to control all electronic devices and appliances. In this section, we discussed the various components for SBs including sensors and actuators, smart control devices, smart gateway, networking and software platforms. SECTION IV. Ml Background for SBS: Models, Tasks, and Tools Massive data generated from sensors, wearable devices, and other IoT technologies provide rich information about the context of users and building status and can be used to design SB management. This context information is needed to extract useful and interesting insights for various stakeholders. When the data volume is very high, developing predictive models using traditional approaches does not provide accurate insight and we require newly developed tools from big data. Big data is primed to make a big impact in SBs and is already playing a big role in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industries [73], notably for waste analytics [74] and waste minimization [75]. ML is a powerful tool that facilitates the process of mining a massive amount of data that have been collected from different sources around us and make sense of a complicated world. ML algorithms apply a model on new data by learning the model from a set of observed data examples called a training set. For example, after being trained on a set of sample accelerometer data marked as walking or jogging, an ML algorithm can classify the future data points into walking and jogging classes. ML makes it relatively easy to develop advanced software systems without much involvement from the human side. They are applicable to many real-life problems in SB environments. One can also design and develop self-learning and collaborative systems. ML does not remove the human element from data science—it draws on computers’ strengths in handling big data to complement our understanding of semantics and context. It only needs training data to extract better features or parameters required to improve a given system. ML algorithms can be used to make predictions based on data patterns. It enables the computer to learn from the fed input data without being explicitly programmed so that ML algorithms can learn from and make predictions on input data [76], [77]. Nest thermostat is an example of a device that applies a specific temperature in a specific room and at a certain time of day according to the occupants’ preference. There are devices such as Amazon’s Echo that can learn from voice patterns, and the others those learn from much more complex behavior and activity patterns. A. Ml Models ML techniques have been widely used to develop smart systems which can sense and react according to context modifications in SBs [78]. There are many different ML algorithms, according to the two well-known theorems No Free Lunch theorem and Ugly Duckling theorem. No Free Lunch theorem states “there are no algorithms that can be said to be better than any other”, without prior information about the problem, any two algorithms may perform equally well in solving a problem. While Ugly Duckling theorem states “we cannot say that any two different patterns would be more similar to each other than any other pairs.” [79]. Mainly, ML is categorized into four categories handling different types of learning tasks as follows: Supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning and reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms Figure 7 shows ML styles. These categories are described next and a summarized comparison between these ML techniques is presented in Table 5. TABLE 5 Comparison of ML Techniques FIGURE 7. ML styles. Show All 1) Supervised Learning refers to developing algorithms based on a labeled training dataset, from which the learner should generalize a representation by building the system model that represents the relations between the input, output and system parameters. ML model is developed through a training process that continues on the input training data until the model reaches the desired level of accuracy [80], [81]. Some examples of common supervised ML algorithms are: naive Bayes model, decision tree, linear discriminant functions such as support vector machines (SVMs), artificial neural networks (ANNs), hidden Markov models (HMMs), instance-based learning (such as k-nearest-neighbor learning), ensembles (bagging, boosting, random forest), logistic regression, genetic algorithms, and logistic regression [82], [83]. Supervised learning approaches are extensively used to solve different problems in smart buildings. Application in SBs: Boger et al. [76] proposed a supervised learning system using Markov decision processes to help people with dementia the process of hand washing. Altun et al. [84] make a comparative study on the supervised human activity classification approaches using body-worn miniature inertial and magnetic sensors. Mozer [85] developed the occupant comfort control of the home environment system using neural networks and reinforcement learning to control air heating, lighting, ventilation, and water heating in the smart home environment. Bourobou et al. [86] presented a hybrid approach using ANN and K-pattern clustering to identify and predict user activities in the smart environments. Hsu et al. [87] proposed a TV recommendation system using a neural network model based on user personalized properties such as activities, interests, moods, experiences, and demographic information data. Fleury et al. [88] proposed a healthcare-focused smart home system using the SVM algorithm to classify daily living activities based on the data from the different sensors. Supervised learning problems can be further grouped into classification, regression, time series, and ensemble method problems. a: Classification The task of classification algorithms is to classify an instance into a specific discrete set of possible categories. Given two sets of data (labeled and unlabeled datasets), the labeled dataset is used for the training process, while the unlabeled dataset will be used to evaluate of the classification results. The normal process is to count the number of instances that are assigned to the right category, which is also known as the accuracy rate (AR) defined by [21]. The classification algorithm can mathematically be described as follows: AR= N c N t (1) View Source where N c denotes the number of test instances that are correctly assigned to their categories to which they belong; N t the number of test instances. The precision ( P ) and recall ( R ) are used to measure the details of the classification results. The four possible outcomes are true positive ( TP ), false negative ( FN ), false positive ( FP ), and true negative ( TN ), the precision ( P ) and recall ( R ) are generally defined as: P= TP TP+FP (2) View Source Given P and R , a simple method to describe the precision and recall of the overall classification results, called F-score or F-measure, is defined as: F= 2PR P+R (3) View Source Commonly used classification techniques include decision trees, SVM, rule-based induction, neural networks, deep learning, memory-based reasoning, and Bayesian networks [89]. b: Decision Tree Algorithms The decision tree method is an important predictive ML modeling approach, which constructs a model of decisions presented based on the actual values of features in the data. Decision trees can be utilized for both classification and regression problems. In tree structures, leaves represent class labels and branches represent conjunctions of attributes that drive to those labels [90]. The decision trees that the target variable takes continuous values called regression trees. Decision trees are often one of the favorites of ML algorithms because of its speed and accuracy. The most common algorithms for decision tree are [91]: classification and regression tree, ID3, C4.5 and C5.0, Chi-squared, M5, and conditional decision trees. Application in SBs: Delgado et al. [92] propose an ML technique based on decision trees to extract the most frequent activities of human behavior and the temporal relationship of those activities in order to produce the human behavior quickly in a smart environment. Viswanathan et al. [93] introduce a prototype distributed data mining system for healthcare environment using C4.5 classification algorithm that can provide the patient monitoring and health services. Decision trees algorithm is a non-parametric algorithm that is easy to interpret and explain. The main disadvantage of this algorithm is that it can easily overfit. c: Bayesian Algorithms Bayesian methods utilize Bayes’ theorem for classification and regression problems. The most common Bayesian algorithms are [94]: Naive Bayes, Gaussian naive Bayes, Bayesian belief network, Bayesian network. Application in SBs: Parnandi et al. [95] propose an indoor localization approach based on Naive Bayes classification and dynamic time warping, they exploit the embedded sensors of smartphones to determine the building that the user entered and the activities that the user is performing inside the building. Verbert et al. [96] proposed an ML approach based on Bayesian network to diagnosis the fault in HVAC systems. The model has been constructed based expert knowledge concerning conservation laws, component interdependencies, and historical data using virtual sensors. Naive Bayes classifier approaches have been applied with potential results for human activity recognition in [97], [98]. Naive Bayes approach recognizes human activities that identify with the highest probability to the set of sensor readings that were observed. d: Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised ML algorithm which can be applied for both classification and regression problems though mostly used in classification challenges [140]. SVM is one of the most popularly utilized for many statistical learning problems, such as face and object recognition, text classification, spam detections, handwriting analysis etc. [141]. is maximizing the margin that separating between the hyperplane of two classes’ closest points. Support vectors are the points lying on the boundaries, and the optimal separating hyperplane is the middle of the margin [142]. Application in SBs: Fu et al. [105] proposed an SVM method to predict the system level electricity loads of public buildings that have electricity sub-metering systems. A real-time human tracker system proposed Nguyen et al. [106] using SVM for predicting and recognizing human motion based on the input images from a network of four cameras in the ubiquitous smart homes. Petersen et al. [107] developed an SVM model to predict the times where visitors are present in the home using only the data provided by wireless motion sensors in each room. Fleury et al. [88] presented a study for automatic recognition of daily living activities in a smart home based on SVM. They collected the data from various sensors such as Infra-Red Presence Sensors, door contacts, temperature and hygrometry sensor, and microphones. Das et al. [108] proposed a one-class classification approach for a real-time activity error detection in smart homes using one-class SVM. Zhao et al. [143] proposed an ML approach based on SVM and RNN to detect the occupancy behavior of a building through the temperature and heating source information for the energy efficiency consumption purposes. e: Artificial Neural Network Algorithms (ANNs) ANN models are inspired by the process of biological neural networks. ANN models are commonly utilized for regression and classification problems. The common ANN algorithms are [94]: Perceptron, Back-Propagation, Hopfield Network, and Radial Basis Function Network (RBFN). ANNs provide a number of advantages including it requires less statistical training, it has the capacity to detect complex nonlinear relationships between the predictor and response variables, as well as the ability to detect all possible relationships between predictor variables [104]. On the other hand, disadvantages include its “black box” nature, heavy computational burden and proneness to overfitting. However, due to the inherent features of neural networks, it has the following main limitations: challenge in training with no local optima, its accommodation to modifications in the behavior, the validation process of the results, and the complexity of network performance interpretation. Application in SBs: Badlani and Bhanot [99] developed a smart home system for energy efficiency applying pattern recognition based on ANNs, the system incorporates an RNN to capture human behavior patterns and an ANN for security applications in smart homes. Other researchers have applied ANNs to present context-aware services. Campo et al. [100] developed a system that calculates the probability of occupation for each section of the building and compares the probability with the current situation systematically. See [101] for a survey paper focusing on the role of ANNs for smart home services. Ermes et al. [102] proposed a hybrid classifier approach using a tree structure comprising a priori knowledge and ANN to recognize the activities such as rowing, biking, playing football, walking, running, sitting, or hiking. Ciabattoni et al. [103] proposed a home energy management system design using the neural network algorithm to predict the power production of the photovoltaic plant and the home consumptions during the given time. f: Deep Learning Algorithms: Deep learning methods represent an evolved form of ANNs in which a deep architecture (many layers comprising multiple linear and non-linear transformations [144]) is used. One of the promises of DL is replacing the manually selected features with efficient unsupervised or semi-supervised feature learning and hierarchical feature extraction algorithms. The most common DL algorithms are [145]: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Deep Boltzmann Machine (DBM), Deep Belief Network (DBN), and Stacked Auto-Encoders. Deep learning has been used successfully in varieties of big data analytics applications, particularly natural language processing (NLP) applications, medical diagnosis, stock market trading, network security, and image identification. Deep learning is now ubiquitously used in major businesses and companies. Microsoft research on a deep learning system presented real-time speech translation system between Mandarin Chinese and English languages [146]. Apple’s Siri uses a deep learning trained model, and the voice recognition in the Google Android phone also uses a deep learning trained model [147]. DL utilizes a number of techniques such as drop-out and convolutions that enables the models to learn efficiently from high-dimensional data. However, DL requires much more data to train compared to other algorithms because of the magnitudes of parameters for estimation required by the models. Application in SBs: Choi et al. [114] propose two prediction algorithms deep belief network and restricted Boltzmann machines based on the DL framework for predicting different human activities in a building. They also presented a hybrid model which combines for predicting human behavior. The paper [115] proposes a generic deep learning framework based on convolutional and RNNs for human activity recognition that is suitable for multimodal wearable sensors, such as accelerometers, gyroscopes or magnetic field sensors. Alsheikh et al. [116] proposed a hybrid approach of DL and hidden Markov model for human activity recognition using triaxial accelerometers. Baccouche et al. [117] propose a two-steps neural-based deep model to classify human activities, the first step of the model is automatically learned spatiotemporal features based on Convolutional Neural Networks. Then the second step of the model uses an RNN to classify the entire sequence of the learned features for each time-step. In [118], they propose an acceleration-based human activity recognition method using Convolution Neural Network. In [119] a deep convolutional neural network as the automatic feature extractor and classifier for recognizing human activities is proposed using the accelerometer and gyroscope on a smartphone. Hammerla et al. [148] explore the performance of deep, convolutional, and recurrent approaches of deep learning for human activity recognition using wearable sensors. For the sake of measuring the performance, the authors used three representative datasets that comprise motion data collected from wearable sensors. g: Hidden Markov Models (Hmm) An HMM is a doubly stochastic process with a hidden underlying stochastic process that can be observed through the sequence of observed symbols emitted by another stochastic process. Application in SBs: Wu et al. [113] proposed an improved HMM to predict user behaviors in order to provide services for people with disabilities. They developed a temporal state transition matrix to be utilized instead of the fixed state transition matrix. Lv and Nevatia [112] used hidden Markov models for both automatic recognition and segmentation of 3-D human activities to allow real-time evaluation and feedback for physical rehabilitation. Cheng et al. [110] proposed an inference engine based on the HMM that provides a comprehensive activity of daily living recognition capability. They integrated both Viterbi and Baum-Welch algorithms to enhance the accuracy and learning capability. Chahuara et al. [111] proposed sequence-based models for online recognition of daily living activities in an SB environment. They presented three of sequence-based models: HMM, conditional random fields, and a sequential Markov logic network. h: Time Series Analysis A time series is a collection of temporal instances; time series data set usually have the following characteristics include the high dimensionality, large number of instances, and updating continuously [149]. One of the important purposes for time series representation is to reduce the dimension, and it divides into three categories: model-based representation, non-data-adaptive representation, and data-adaptive representation [150], [151]. Application in SBs: Survadevara et al. [125] proposed a wellness model using seasonal autoregression integration moving average time series with sleeping activity scenario in a smart home environment to forecast the elderly sleeping tendency. Zhou et al. [126] proposed a time series analysis framework to explore relationships among non-stationary time series in the case of data sensors in SBs. Jakkula and Cook [127] propose a time series based framework to determine temporal rules from observed physical and instrumental activities of occupants in a smart home. i: Regression The aim in regression problems is to estimate a real-valued target function. It is related to representing the relationship between variables that are repeatedly processed utilizing a measure of error in the predictions made by the model [152]. The most common regression algorithms are [153]: linear regression, logistic regression, stepwise regression, and ordinary least squares regression. Application in SBs: Chen et al. [120] used the regression technique of orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm to identify the physical and environmental parameters that providing the energy efficiency in an SB. Bouchard et al. [121] presented a gesture recognition system using linear regression combined with the correlation coefficient to recognize the gesture direction and estimate the segmentation of continuing gestures of daily usage activities in a smart environment. j: Ensemble Methods A combination of multiple classifiers often referred to as a classifier ensemble, group of classification models that are trained separately and the predictions of those models are then combined in a way to produce the overall prediction [154]. The most popular ensemble learning based classification techniques are [155]: random forest, boosting, gradient boosting machines, AdaBoost, bagging, and blending. Application in SBs: Jurek et al. [122] proposed a cluster-based ensemble approach solution for activity recognition within the application domain of smart homes. With this approach, activities are modeled as cluster collections built on different subsets of features. Fatima et al. [123] proposed an ensemble classifier method for activity recognition in smart homes using genetic algorithm optimization to merge the prediction output of multiple classifiers that make up the ensemble. They used the ANN, HMM, conditional random field, and SVM [13] as base classifiers for activity recognition. Guan and Ploetz [124] proposed a deep LSTM ensemble method for activity recognition using wearables: more specifically, the authors developed modified training procedures for LSTM networks and proposed the combination of sets of diverse LSTM learners into classifier collectives. 2) Unsupervised Learning Unsupervised Learning refers to developing algorithms that use data with no labels to analyze the behavior or the system being investigated [156]. Thus, the algorithm does not know about the truth of the outcome. In other words, the unsupervised learning algorithm classifies the sample sets to different clusters by investigating the similarity between the input samples. Clustering is done using different parameters taken from the data which enable us to identify correlations which are not so obvious. The inferring structures existing within the input data is used to prepare the model to prepare and extract general rules of the model. A mathematical process might be used to systematically reduce redundancy, or organize data by similarity [129]. The unsupervised approach has been applied to recognize various activities in smart buildings when it is challenging to have labels for input data [130]. Common unsupervised learning problems are clustering, dimensionality reduction, and association rule learning. There are a variety of commonly used unsupervised learning algorithms, some of those algorithms are based on supervised-learning algorithms: the Apriori algorithm and k-Means. In unsupervised learning, usually there is no a measure for the output; we recognize only the features and the target is to define the patterns and relationships among a set of input measures [80]. The major disadvantage of unsupervised learning is the absence of direction for the learning algorithm, hence, there might not be any useful detected knowledge in the selected set of attributes for the training. Clustering is a method of unsupervised learning that involves detecting patterns in the data by placing each data element into a group of K-clusters, where each group holds data elements most similar to each other [157]. Unsupervised learning problems can be categorized into clustering and association problems, which are described next. a: Clustering A clustering problem explores the internal groupings in the input data, such as grouping customers by their purchasing habits. Clustering techniques are usually organized by modeling strategies such as centroid-based and hierarchical. All methods are concerned with handling the internal structures in the input data to properly organize the data into groups of maximum commonality [158]. The quality of the clustering result is evaluated depends on the type of application that utilizes a clustering algorithm. For example, the sum of squared errors is generally utilized for data clustering while the peak-signal-to-noise ratio is used for image clustering [21]. The most common clustering algorithms are [153]: k-Means, k-Medians, expectation maximization, and hierarchical clustering. Application in SBs: Fahad et al. [128] propose an activity recognition approach that combines the classification with the clustering, in their approach the activity instances are clustered using Lloyd’s clustering algorithm. Then, they apply evidence theoretic K-Nearest neighbors learning method that combines KNN with the Dampster Shafer theory of evidence. The paper [86] proposes a hybrid approach to recognize and predict user activities in a smart environment. They use the K-pattern clustering algorithm to classify so varied and complex user activities, and ANN to recognize and predict users’ activities inside their personal rooms. Lapalu et al. [82] used an unsupervised learning approach to address the issues of daily living activities’ learning in smart home. They utilize the Flocking algorithm for clustering analysis of a use case in cognitive assistance service that assists the people suffering from some type of dementia such as Alzheimer’s disease. Aicha et al. [83] present an unsupervised learning approach for detecting abnormal visits of an elderly in a smart home environment based on a Markov modulated Poisson process model. The model combines multiple data streams, such as in the front-door sensor transitions and the general sensor transitions. The other cases of social communication services, Rashidi and Cook [129] applied an unsupervised learning approach to detect social interaction and monitor activity daily living in a smart space, their approach can adapt and update automatically to reflect the changes in discovered patterns from implicit and explicit identified feedbacks of the occupant. Rashidi et al. [130] introduce an unsupervised method that identifies and tracks the normal activities that commonly occur in an individual’s routine in a smart environment. The activity discovery method of the system is produced to cluster the sequences based on the simple k-means algorithm. Fiorini et al. [159] proposed an unsupervised ML approach to identify the behavioral patterns of the occupants using unannotated data collected from low-level sensors in an SB. Their approach involves processing and analyzing collected data related to the daily living activities of 17 older adults living in a community-based home supplied with a variety of sensors. They extract activity information from collected data at different times of the day. b: Association The association rule learning problem is utilized to identify the rules that define large portions of input data, such as people that buy X item also tend to buy Y item. Association analysis is performed on rules discovered by analyzing input data for frequent if/then statement and using the criteria of support and confidence to discover relationships between unrelated data in a relational database or another information repository. Here “support” indicates how frequently the items appear in the database while “confidence” indicates the number of times the if/then statements have been found to be true. Many algorithms for generating association rules have been proposed. Apriori algorithm is the most well-known association algorithm [160]. Application in SBs: Aztiria et al. [161] proposed system that learns the frequent patterns of human behavior using association, workflow mining, clustering, and classification techniques. The core part of the system is the learning layer which is made up of two modules: the language module, which provides a standard conceptualization of the patterns; and the algorithm module, which discovers the patterns. Kang et al. [162] proposed a service scenario generation scheme for interpreting association rules extracted from the states of all devices in SB environments. Typically, These states are collected periodically at a specific time interval from the devices. Nazerfard et al. [163] propose a framework to discover the temporal features of the activities, including the temporal sequencing of activities and their start time and duration using the temporal association rule techniques in a smart home. 3) Semi-Supervised Learning Semi-Supervised learning lies between supervised and unsupervised methods. Input data is a composite of labeled and unlabeled samples. These hybrid algorithms aim to inherit the strengths of the main categories while mitigating their weaknesses. The model learns the patterns present in the data and also make predictions. Example problems are classification and regression [164]. There are some common semi-supervised learning models, including generative models, heuristic approaches, semi-supervised SVM, graph-based methods, self-training, help-training, mixture models, co-training and multi-view learning [94]. Application in SBs: Cook [131] combined fully-supervised and semi-supervised learning to recognize and follow activities that support health monitoring and assistance context-aware services for people experiencing difficulties living individually at smart homes. Liu et al. [132] proposed a vision based semi-supervised learning approach for fall detection and recognizing other activity daily living in smart environments to overcome the labeling challenges of human activities by systematic interpreting the activities with the highest confidence. Fahmi et al. [133] proposed a semi-supervised fall detection approach in which a supervised algorithm utilizing decision trees in the training process and then profiles are used to implement a semi-supervised algorithm based on multiple thresholds. Radu et al. [134] present semi-supervised ML method using only the low power sensors on a smartphone to consider the problem of determining whether a user is indoors or outdoors. Guan et al. [135] propose a semi-supervised learning algorithm for activity recognition named En-Co-training to make use of the available unlabeled samples to enhance the performance of activity learning with a limited number of labeled samples. The proposed algorithm extends the co-training paradigm by using an ensemble method. 4) Reinforcement Learning Reinforcement learning is a learning approach to control a system in order to maximize performance measure that represents a long-term objective [165]. Reinforcement learning, an area of ML inspired by behaviorist psychology, is concerned with the way that software agents have to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the concept of cumulative reward. RL algorithms learn control policies, particularly when there is no a priori knowledge and there is a massive amount of training data. However, RL algorithms suffer from some drawback such as the high computational cost required to find the optimal solution, such that all states need to be visited to choose the optimal one. The well-known approaches of RL are Brute force, Monte Carlo methods, Temporal difference methods, and Value function [166]. Q-learning [167] is a model-free reinforcement learning approach based on learning the required utility given a state decision. Application in SBs: Mozer [136] applied Q-learning for lighting regulation to predict the time of turning the lights ON/OFF in a building. This prediction model can be utilized to schedule the lights’ activations in a building for efficient energy consumption proposes. Li and Jayaweera [137] proposed a Q-learning based approximate dynamic programming algorithm to provide a more efficient, flexible and adaptive method. This approach can enable customers to make an optimal on-line decision making in SB environment to maximize the profits based on both local fully observable and the estimated hidden information of the building. Khalili and Aghajan [138] proposed a temporal differential class of RL method for autonomous learning of a user’s preference of music and lighting service settings in presence of different states of the user in SB environment. The preferences are learned by the model by using the explicit or implicit feedback from users when they react to the provided service. Xu et al. [139] give a survey of developments in RL algorithms with function approximation. They evaluated and compared different RL algorithms using several benchmark learning, prediction, and learning control tasks. B. ML Tasks for SBS In this section, we will describe the major ML tasks that are relevant to SB. The reader is referred to Figure 8 for a general depiction of ML tasks in SBs and the steps taken to implement ML in an SB environment. FIGURE 8. ML tasks in SB environment. Show All 1) Data Collection and Acquisition A variety of data collection approaches are used, each of which has different deals in terms of capabilities, energy efficiency, and connectivity. Sensors and similar objects in SBs produce raw data simultaneously in an automated way and such devices may store the data for a specific period of time or report it to controlled components [168]. Data can be collected at gateways; the collected data is then filtered and processed, fused into compact forms for efficient transmission. A variety of communication technologies such as Zigbee, Wi-Fi, and cellular are utilized to transfer data to collection points. Data collected from a global-scale deployment of smart things defines the basis for decision making and providing services. It is possible that the decisions are unreliable when the quality of utilized data is poor [169]. Zhao et al. [170] propose a data acquisition and transmission system which could be used for monitoring systems to collect energy consumption data (e.g., electricity, water, gas, heating, etc.) from terminal meters which are installed in buildings. The system stores the data periodically after analyzing and processing it and finally transmits the data to servers through the Ethernet. Rowley et al. [171] propose the data acquisition and modeling approaches that can support the delivery of building energy infrastructure in both new building and renovated real-world contexts. Such methods provide a means to achieve short, medium and long-term forecasting of possible scenario pathways to multi-objective sustainable outcomes. CLEEN MMEA [172] platform that collects, processes, and manages the data and initiates contextual knowledge extraction. The purpose is to establish an online marketplace to collect data and provide services for different companies. The interfaces are made public so that any company can easily join the network to buy or sell services. The analysis results can be given to an energy services company in order to allow offering the service to the owners. A typical example of open access data collection system is e3Portal [173] developed by VTT in collaboration with Finnish municipalities. e3Portal offers information and tools when planning savings measures and energy retrofitting in municipal buildings. It also involves frequently updated data regarding energy and water consumption in thousands of public buildings like schools, kindergartens, offices, hospitals, other health care facilities, etc. Decision makers, designers, operation and maintenance personnel, as well as buildings users, can utilize it. There are projects that provide publicly available SB datasets for researchers to conduct further studies; A list of “Home Datasets” [174] includes the datasets collected by projects from UC Berkeley, MIT, Washington State University, University of Amsterdam, University of Edinburgh, and the University of Tokyo. The WARD [175] project supported by NSF TRUST Center at UC Berkeley provides a benchmark dataset for human action recognition using a wearable motion sensor network. The dataset was collected from 13 repetitive actions by 13 male and 7 female participants between the ages of 19 and 75. An MIT project [176] collected daily live activities dataset from two single-person apartments within a period of two weeks. Eighty-four sensors to record opening-closing events were attached to different appliances and devices such as drawers, refrigerators, containers, etc. Banos et al. [177] introduced an open benchmark dataset collected from various inertial sensors attached to different parts of the body. They considered 33 fitness activities, recorded using 9 inertial sensor units from 17 participants. The CASAS project [178] at Washington State University provides a publicly-available dataset for a three-bedroom apartment with one bathroom, a kitchen, and a living room. Different types of motion and digital sensors are installed to support temperature readings, in addition, the analog sensors are installed to support readings for hot water, cold water, and stove burner use [179]. The PlaceLab project [180] of MIT provides a dataset collected from a one-bedroom apartment with more than 900 sensors, including those coming from motion, switch and RFID sensors. That is being used to monitor activity in the environment in the context of a smart home [181]. A collection of smart meters data from five houses in the UK [182] That consists of 400 million instances. The active power is formed by different appliances and the whole-house power demand every 6 seconds. The major challenges that arise for data collection are scalability, privacy, security, and heterogeneity of resources [183]. Automated sensor data collection process collects a large amount of data that overwhelms the collection and analysis centers in comparison to the data collected from other sources such as IoT devices and social media. This leads to a huge number of small synchronous write operations to the database storage system, consequently, resulting in serious performance bottlenecks to the storage system design [184]. Because of the extensive use of RFID technology, privacy issues arise in data collection; for example, the RFID tags carried by a person may become a unique identifier for that person. Also, other security concerns appear, for example, the radio signals of RFID technology are easily jammed. Hence, that can disrupt the data collection process [185]. The heterogeneity of data that is being collected from different resources is another major challenge, such that the data are usually very noisy, large-scale, and distributed. This makes it very difficult to use the collected data effectively without a clear description of existing data processing techniques [184]. 2) Data Preprocessing A large amount of data are generated by sensors in SBs; this data comes from various sources with diverse formats and structures. Usually, this data is not ready for analysis as it might be incomplete or redundant due to low battery power, poor calibration, exposure to various malicious elements and interference. Therefore, raw data typically needs to be preprocessed to deal with missing data, discard noisy and redundant data and integrate data from various sources into an integrated schema before being committed to storage. This preprocessing is called data cleaning. The quality of data can be improved substantially by applying some cleaning techniques to the data before it arrives its end user [168], [186]. Data cleaning is one of the significant tasks in the data processing phase. Data cleaning is not a new process particular for the IoT data processing. It has already been applied as a process for database management systems. Presenting a data cleaning method would further aid the applications to focus on their core logic without worrying about data reliability post-processing overheads [184]. There are many different techniques that have been utilized to deal with the problem of cleaning noisy data streams such as Kalman filters [187], statistical models [186] and outlier detection models [184]. One of the major challenges with data cleaning techniques in the SBs is the heterogeneity of data collected from different sources particularly WSN- and RFID-enabled data streams. The utilized data cleaning techniques should be able to deal with several different variables of interest to satisfy IoT applications’ requirements, for example, setting home temperature based on observed outer temperature, user habits, energy management, etc. [169] Any type of failures such as a failed sensor, network issues, camera failure, or database crashes in the process of collecting data would invalidate the data. Consequently, this type of impediment will dramatically increase the time required to collect data [179]. 3) Dimensionality Reduction There are huge volumes of raw data that are captured from heterogeneous and ubiquitous of sensors used in SBs. Most of the data collected from those sensors are redundant and they need to be brought down to a smaller number of features by applying dimensionality reduction techniques without losing significant information [188]. The main idea from the dimensionality reduction strategy is to find a new coordinate system in which the input data can be represented with much fewer features without losing significant information. The dimensionality reduction can be made in two different ways: by extracting of the features that represent the significant data characteristics (this technique is called feature extraction), or by only selecting the most relevant features from the original dataset, this method is called feature selection [189], [190]. Like clustering methods, the dimensionality reduction approach explores and exploits the internal structure of the data, but in this case in an unsupervised manner using less information. Most of these techniques can be utilized in classification and regression problems. Examples of some salient algorithms are [153]: Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Principal Component Regression (PCR), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). Chen et al. [191] propose a framework using the classification information of local geometry of data to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset on human activity recognition from wearable, object, and ambient sensors. a: Feature Extraction The main components of the original data are the features. After extracting the features from the raw dataset, such features contain important information that is used by the learning algorithms for the activities discrimination. The most common methods of feature extraction work in time, frequency, and discrete domains [192]. Among time domain method, mean and standard deviation are the key approaches for almost all sensor types. While the frequency domain method focuses on the periodic structure of the collected data. Wavelet Transformation and Fourier Transform are the most common approaches. And discrete domain methods such as Euclidean-based distances, dynamic time warping, and Levenshtein edit distance are key approaches implemented in several applications such to string similarity, classifying human activities and modeling human behavioral patterns [16], [193]. b: Feature Selection The main role of feature selection is to discriminate the most related subset of features within a high dimensional vector of features, so that reduces the load of noise and computational expense on the learning models. In order to map the high dimensional vector of features into a lower dimensional vector, there are several common algorithms used such as Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Independent Component Analysis (ICA) [194]. Hausmann and Ziekow [195] proposed an approach for automatically adapting the feature selection for SBs application ML models from the time-series data based on wrapper methods and genetic optimization. Fahad et al. [196] propose an activity recognition approach for overlapping activities using K-Nearest neighbors approach that distinguishes the most important features from the collected information obtained from deployed sensors in multiple locations and objects. Fang et al. [197] determine that the different feature sets generate different levels of accuracy for recognizing human activities, and selecting inappropriate datasets increases the level of computational complexity and decreases the level of prediction accuracy in smart home environments. The wrapper and filtering are the two main statistical methods of feature selection problem. It is argued that although the wrapper approach may obtain better performances, filters are less resource intensive and faster [198]. In [199], different feature selection methods are utilized for the process of dimensionality reduction of the learning problem to recognize the human activities from observed sensors. The authors show that the performance of the learning models to recognize the human activity has a strong relationship with the utilized features. c: Feature Projection feature projection can be represented as a mapping from the original set of features to an appropriate set that optimizes the learning criterion, such that the feature projection approach allows the process of visualizing and mapping the high-dimensional feature vectors to low dimensional one, in addition, it enables analyzing the distribution of the reduced feature vectors [200]. Consequently, the feature projection approach reduces the pattern recognition’s processing time and enables selecting the best-performed classifier for the reduced feature vectors. Hence, it makes real-time implementation possible [198]. Chu et al. [201] proposed a linear supervised feature projection that utilizes the LDA algorithm for EMG pattern recognition that attempted to recognize nine kinds of hand motion. C. ML Tools & Platforms for SBs There are a variety of existing ML platforms and tools to support the learning process. With the current increasing number of those kinds of toolkits, the task of selecting the right tool for processing big data streaming from various sources can still be difficult. Typically, there is no single toolkit that truly fits and provides solutions for all different problems. Many of the available toolkits might have overlapping uses, and each has advantages and disadvantages. Most of those toolkits might require experiences in the domains of programming languages and system architecture. In addition, usually many people lack a full understanding of the capabilities and how to use those available platforms [202]. The important factors that must be considered when selecting a specific ML tool are scalability, speed, coverage, usability, extensibility, and programming languages support. With respect to the scalability factor, the size and complexity of the data should be considered to determine if a specific toolkit will be fit. The processing platform that the library is running on and the complexity of the algorithm affect the speed factor. Not all the projects prioritize the speed factor; if the models require frequent updates, the speed may be a crucial concern; but not otherwise. Coverage represents the number of ML algorithms implemented in the tool. With the massive amount of data capturing from heterogeneous sources, ML community faces the challenges of how the ML model can efficiently process and learn from the big data. In general, the available big data tools do not implement all varieties of different classes of ML algorithms, and typically their coverage ranges from a few algorithms to around two dozen. The usability factor includes elements such as initial setup processing; continuous maintenance; the available programming languages and user interface available; the amount of documentation, or availability of a knowledgeable user. The extensibility factor means that the implementations introduced in the tools can be utilized as building blocks towards new systems. It is necessary to evaluate tools in terms of how well they are able to meet this factor. There are a variety of ML libraries that are available in different programming languages. Depending on the task you are trying to accomplish, certain languages, libraries, and tools can be more effective than others. The following provides a detailed observation of the strengths and weaknesses of the top used deep learning and ML tools. The reader is also referred to Table 6 for a concise tabulated summary of the described deep learning and ML tools. TABLE 6 Comparison Between Deep Learning and ML Tools 1) H2O H20 [203] is an open-source in-memory, distributed, and scalable ML framework for big-data analysis that supports ML libraries, along with tools for parallel processing, analytics, data preprocessing and evaluation tools.

In addition to the processing engine provided by H2O framework, it also allows the users to integrate their models with other available frameworks such as Spark and Storm. Depending on what is suitable for the algorithm, The H2O’s engine uses multiple execution methods to process data completely in memory. The general technique used is distributed Fork/Join, which is reliable and suitable for massively parallel tasks. The H2O software can be run on different operating systems such as Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux (e.g. Ubuntu 12.04; CentOS), It also runs on Apache Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and Spark systems for big-data analysis. In addition, it can operate on various cloud computing environments such as Amazon EC2, Google Compute Engine, and Microsoft Azure. As of July 2016, the algorithms supported in H2O cover the tasks classification, clustering, generalized linear models, statistical analysis, ensembles, optimization tools, data preprocessing options and deep neural networks. 2) MLlib (Spark) MLlib [204] is Apache Spark’s ML library. MLlib aims to provide scalable and easy to use ML methods. It includes common ML algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, as well as lower-level optimization primitives and higher-level pipeline APIs.

MLLib supports implementations for linear regression and isotonic regression, and incorporates a collaborative filtering algorithm using alternating least squares. PCA is supported for dimensionality reduction. MLlib includes APIs for development in Scala, Java, Python, and SparkR. Generally, MLlib depends on Spark’s iterative batch and streaming approaches, as well as its use of in-memory computation. 3) Tensorflow Tensorflow [205] is an open source software library for numerical computation and deep ML in a variety of perceptual and language understanding tasks utilizing data flow graphs. TensorFlow was originally developed by the Google Brain team and was released in November 2015 under an Apache 2.0 open source license. TensorFlow has tools that support deep learning, reinforcement learning, and other algorithms. TensorFlow implements data flow graphs, where “tensors” are batches of data that can be processed by a set of algorithms defined by a graph. The movements of the data through the system are called “flows”—hence, the name. TensorFlow can run on multiple CPUs and GPUs. It can run on Linux, Mac OS X desktop, and server systems, and Windows support on roadmap, as well as on Android and Apple’s iOS mobile computing platforms. TensorFlow is written with a Python API over a C/C++ engine that makes it run fast. TensorFlow utilizes a symbolic graph of vector operations method, in order to easily define a new network. However, TensorFlow has a weakness that is related to modeling flexibility. Such that each computational flow has to be constructed as a static graph. That makes some computations such as beam search difficult. 4) Torch Torch [206] is an open source ML computing framework that supports a variety of ML algorithms. Torch was originally developed at NYU. It is efficient and easy to use, thanks to a script language based on the Lua programming language and a C/CUDA implementation, Torch was intended to be portable, fast, extensible, and easy to use in development. Some version of Torch is employed by large companies such as Google DeepMind, the Facebook AI Research Group, IBM, Yandex, and the Idiap Research Institute. In addition, it has been extended to run on Android and iOS platforms. A variety of community-contributed packages for Torch, giving it a versatile range of support and functionality. It provides various deep learning algorithms that support computer vision; signal, image, video, and audio processing; parallel processing and networking [207]. 5) Deeplearning4j Deeplearning4j [221] is an open source distributed DL library, primarily developed by Adam Gibson from an ML group in San Francisco. Deeplearning4j is written for Java and JVM as well as to support a variety of DL algorithms such as restricted Boltzmann machine, deep belief networks, convolutional networks, recurrent neural networks, deep autoencoder, stacked denoising autoencoder, and recursive neural tensor network. All these algorithms can be integrated with Hadoop and Spark for distributed parallel processing. Deeplearning4j relies on Java programming language, in addition, it is compatible with Clojure and includes a Scala API. Deeplearning4j is designed to be utilized in business environments, rather than as a research tool. It is applied in a variety of applications such as fraud detection, anomaly detection, recommender systems, and image recognition. 6) Massive Online Analysis (Moa) MOA [222] is one of the common open source frameworks for data stream mining and possessing. MOA is written in Java related to the WEKA project that developed at the University of Waikato, New Zealand. It includes a set of learners and stream generators that can be used from the GUI, the command-line, and the Java API.

It utilizes the machine-vision library for fast convolutional networks from Matlab, which has been ported to C and C++. It is developed by the Berkeley vision and learning center and by the community contributors. In Caffe, multimedia scientists and practitioners have an organized and state-of-the-art toolkit for DL algorithms. Caffe was originally developed for machine-vision, it has been utilized and improved by users in other fields such as robotics, neuroscience, speech recognition, and astronomy. In addition, it supports Python and MATLAB code bindings. Caffe offers image classification with state of the art CNN algorithm. Caffe is mainly utilized as a source of pre-trained models hosted on its Model Zoo site. Caffe is useful for performing image analysis using CNNs and regional analysis within images using RCNNs. The performance and processing speed of Cafee make it as one of the most utilized platforms for research experiments and industry deployment. It has the capability to process over 60 million images per day with a single NVIDIA K40 GPU. Caffe has already been applied in many research projects at UC Berkeley and other universities, performing very well in many tasks such as object classification, object detection, and Learning Semantic Features. It provides a complete and well-documented toolkit for training, testing, tuning, and deploying models. Caffe utilizes a large repository of pre-trained neural network models called the Model Zoo, which is suitable for a variety of common image classification tasks [225]. 8) Azure Ml Microsoft first launched Azure ML [226] as a preview in June 2014. Azure ML enables users to create and train models, then convert those models into APIs that can be applied to other services. Users can get up to 10GB of storage per account for model data, although they can also connect their own Azure storage to the service for larger models. programmers can use either the R or Python programming language for developing with Azure services. Users can purchase ML algorithms from Microsoft Azure Marketplace, they can also obtain free algorithms from the community gallery that has been created by Microsoft to share ML algorithms with each other. They share many of predictive analytics of personal assistant in Windows Phone called Cortana. Azure ML also utilizes solutions from Xbox and Bing. Azure currently supports different features and capabilities such as run Hadoop over Ubuntu Linux on Azure, it also supports hosting Storm for analyzing data streams. In addition, it allows developers to connect.NET and Java libraries to Storm. Azure ML studio supports a variety of modules for training, scoring, and validation processes. Azure ML comes with a large library of algorithms for predictive analytics. The popular families of algorithms are regression, anomaly detection, clustering, and classification. D. Real-Time Big Data Analytics Tools for SBS Several applications need to have real-time data analysis for stream data and waiting for the information to be archived and then analyzed is not practical for these type of applications. Generally, Stream processing is intended to analyze a massive amount of data and act on real-time streaming data utilizing continuous queries such as SQL-type queries to handle streaming data in real-time utilizing scalable, available and fault-tolerant architecture. Essential to stream processing is Streaming Analytics. More and more tools offer the possibility of real-time streaming data. The following presents some of the common and widely used options. 1) Apache Storm Storm [227] is an open source distributed real-time data processing framework that provides massively scalable event collection. The initial release was on 17 September 2011, it was created by Nathan Marz and the team at BackType, and is now owned by Twitter. Storm can easily process unlimited streams and with any programming language. It has the capability to process over one million tuples per second per node with a highly scalable, fault-tolerant, and reliable architecture. Storm is written in Java and Clojure. Trident is a high-level abstraction layer for Storm, can be utilized to accomplish state management persistence. Storm is a system of complex event processing. This type of solution allows companies to respond to the arrival of sudden and continuous data (information collected in real-time by sensors, millions of comments generated on social networks such as Twitter, WhatsApp and Facebook, bank transfers etc.). Some of the specific applications of Storm include customer service management in real-time, operational dashboards, data monetization, cybersecurity analytics, and threat detection. 2) Apache Kafka Kafka [228] is a fast, scalable, fault-tolerant and durable open-source message broker project that originally developed by LinkedIn, and subsequently open sourced in early 2011 and released by Apache Software Foundation on 23 October 2012. Kafka is written in Scala. It supports a variety of use case scenarios with a focus on high throughput, reliability, and scalability characteristics. For example, it can message sensor data from heating and cooling equipment in office buildings. 3) Oracle In 2013, Oracle started utilizing Oracle Enterprise Manager that includes Oracle Big Data Appliance to manage all of its big-data technologies. Oracle has also produced multiple low-latency technologies for Oracle Fast Data components includes Oracle Event Processing, Coherence, NoSQL, Business Analytics, and Real-Time Decisions. Oracle Event Processing provides solutions for building applications to filter, correlate and process events in real-time. It supports IoT services by delivering actionable insight on data streaming from a variety of data sources in real-time [229]. Oracle Stream Explorer (OSX) and Oracle R Enterprise (ORE) aim to support equipment monitoring applications for the systems that made of a variety of components through sensors, anomaly detection and failure prediction of such systems. ORE [230] is utilized to handle low-frequency streams in batch mode, while OSX handles the high-frequency streams making real-time predictions and sends the results back to user applications that are communicating with the output channels. OSX [231] is a middleware platform has the capability to process large amounts of streaming data in real-time for a variety of streaming data applications, from a multitude of sources like sensors, social media, financial feeds, etc. It streamlines real-time data delivery into most popular big data solutions, including Apache Hadoop, Apache HBase, Apache Hive, Apache Flume, and Apache Kafka to facilitate improved insight and timely action. Oracle Real-Time Decisions [232] is a decision management platform with self-learning that determines optimized recommendations and actions with messaging, imagery, products, and services within business processes. 4) Amazon Kinesis Streams Amazon Kinesis [233] is a platform for collecting and processing large streams of data on AWS in real-time, AWS launched Kinesis in November of 2013, offering powerful services for loading and analyzing streaming data, in addition, it provides custom streaming data applications for specialized needs. Sometimes Terabytes of data per hour can be generated - that need to be collected, stored, and processed continuously from various application services such as web applications, mobile devices, wearables, industrial sensors etc. Typically, Amazon Kinesis Streams application can use the Amazon Kinesis Client Library and reads data from an Amazon Kinesis stream as data records. These applications can run on Amazon EC2 instances. 5) Apache Spark Streaming Apache Spark [234] is an open-source platform for real-time data processing, it can implement using four different languages: Scala, the syntax in which the platform is written; Python; R; and Java. Spark Streaming is an extension of core Spark API. It allows building fault-tolerant processing of real-time data streams. Spark Streaming allows the processing of millions of data among the clusters, and Spark SQL which makes it easier to exploit the data through the SQL language. Spark Streaming divides the live data stream into a predefined interval of batches, then handles each batch of data as Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs). Then we can apply operations like map, reduce, join, window etc. to process these RDDs. The last results of these operations are then returned in batches. Spark Streaming can be utilized for a variety of application such as real-time monitoring and analyzing of application server logs. These logs messages are considered time series data. Examples of such type of data are sensor data, weather information, and clickstream data. This data can also be utilized for predicting future states based on historical data. Apache assures a computation speed that performs the operations quicker by 100 times than what is currently offered by Hadoop MapReduce in memory, and 10 times better than in disc. Spark can be executed either in independent cluster mode or in the cloud on different frameworks such as Hadoop, Apache Mesos, and EC2. In addition, Spark can access numerous databases such as HDFS, Cassandra, HBase or S3, Amazon’s data warehouse. 6) Apache Flume Flume [242] is a distributed, reliable and open-source log data aggregation framework. Apache Flume is applied in many applications ranging from log data aggregation, to transport massive quantities of event data including network traffic data, social-media-generated data, email messages and pretty much any data source possible into the HDFS. The architecture of Flume is simple and flexible, it is also robust and fault tolerant with tunable reliability mechanisms for failover and recovery. log manufacturing operations is an example of Flume’s application. The a massive log file data can stream through Flume. The log file data can be stored in HDFS and analyzed by utilizing Apache Hive. 7) Apache Samoa SAMOA [243] is a distributed streaming ML framework that contains programming abstractions for distributed streaming ML algorithms. Its name stands for Scalable Advanced Massive Online Analysis and was originally developed at Yahoo! Labs in Barcelona in 2013 and has been part of the Apache incubator since late 2014. SAMOA is both a platform and a library. It enables the algorithm developer to reuse their code to run on different underlying execution engine. In addition, it supports plug-in modules to port SAMOA to different engines. By utilizing SAMOA, the ML algorithm developer does not need to worry about the complexity of underlying distributed stream processing engines. They can run it locally or utilizing one of stream processing engines, such as Storm, S4, or Samza. SAMOA provides the ML algorithms for a variety of tasks including classification, regression, clustering, along with boosting, and bagging for ensemble learning. Additionally, it offers a platform for the implementation of these ML algorithms, as well as a framework that enables the user to write their own distributed streaming algorithms. For example, there is CluStream for clustering, as well as Vertical Hoeffding Tree, which uses vertical parallelism on top of the decision tree, or Hoeffding tree for classification. There is also Adaptive Model Rules Regressor, which uses both vertical and horizontal parallelism implementations for regression [244]. A summarized comparison between various real-time data analytics tools is provided in Table 7. TABLE 7 Comparison Between Real-Time Data Analytics Tools TABLE 8 Categorized Applications of SB SECTION V. Applications of Ml-Based Context-Aware Systems for SBs The potential uses of ML in an SB environment can be divided into four categories: detection, recognition, prediction, and optimization [79]. We discuss these categories separately next. In general, detection is the extraction of particular information from a larger stream of information. Many detection applications in SBs such as fire detection, leak detection, and anomaly detection [245]. Many different applications have been studied by researchers in activity recognition in SBs; examples include fitness tracking, health monitoring, fall detection. [246]. The goal of recognition is to classify an object or an event to a predefined category. It focuses on how to make computer programs perform intelligent and human-like tasks, such as the recognition of an object from an image. The goal of prediction is to determine the temporal relations’ model between specific events to predict what will happen in the near future. Prediction can be either for classification or regression problems [247]. Event prediction when the goal is to predict the most probable event or subsequent activity is an example of classification problems, while latency prediction when the output takes on continuous values is an example of the regression problem. The general steps of applying ML processes to predict an event in an SB environment is shown in Figure 9. FIGURE 9. Steps involved in applying ML models in an SB environment. Show All The goal of optimization, on the other hand, is to maximize the long-term profits by making proper decisions in different situations. reinforcement learning can be utilized with these problems. Some optimization problems can be managed as prediction problems such that the profits for different actions are predicted and the action with the highest profit would be selected. Decision making is the most common case of the optimization problem. It takes to consider a variety of variables and solving deals between the profits of different locations of the environment [248]. Smart buildings are becoming increasingly supplied with a variety of sensors that measure different parameters, and data from these sensors is analyzed by ML algorithms and used for a range of services and applications for the activities of the building occupants. SBs go far beyond saving energy and contributing to sustainability goals. The application and services provided by the SBs can be both residential and commercial ranging from e-health, e-marketing, intelligent car parking system, intelligent transportation system, automation, and logistics services. Figure 10 shows the taxonomy of basic domains of SB services. Lighting services are associated with the well-being of occupants depending on their activities in SBs that have sensors to conserve energy when lights are not needed. The power and electrical system may have onsite renewable energy sources to provide a percentage of power consumption in SBs. Waste management is related to the activities and actions required to collect, separate, transport, together with monitoring and regulation of waste management system in SBs. The security is related to managing automated locks, biometric devices as well as video surveillance systems in SBs. The communications center is related to connecting sensors and actuators in the building as well as the operations control center. The operations control center supports system analytics and decision making for the operations. Visual interfaces provide a dashboard that shows the status of SB services and human operators to better manage the building resources. These interfaces also allow the occupants to set up their optimal parameters for comfort and productivity improvement on daily activities. HVAC stands for the humidity, ventilation and air conditioning system, intended for the convenience of occupants that have effective interaction with the environment. Parking services aim to minimize the area and volume required for parking cars. It could support car sharing, electric vehicles and a place for bicycles as well. Finally, the water management services aim to increase savings and manage water reclamation for flushing, landscaping and air-cooling systems. FIGURE 10. SB services taxonomy. Show All Based on our literature survey, we have identified that the application areas of SBs can be elderly care, comfort/entertainment, security/safety, energy management, and other projects. In the rest of the section, we will briefly describe the major domains in providing the following SB services: (1) care of the elderly population; (2) enhancing energy efficiency; (3) enhancing comfort or providing entertainment; (4) enhancing safety and security; and (5) miscellaneous projects. a: Elderly Population’s Home Care SB technology such as sensors, voice activation, GPS, Bluetooth, cellular connectivity via mobile phones, smartphone monitoring apps and sophisticated computers can be especially useful for elderly or disabled individuals who live independently. Elderly persons can take the advantages of such technologies (e.g., monitoring system, emergency system, dangerous kitchen appliance detection, fall detection), to maintain a safe and healthy lifestyle while living independently [56], [249]. Smart technology in the SBs aims to collect real-time information on human daily activity and then learn of their personal patterns. ML techniques have the potential for a very wide array of new innovations in healthcare that will be transformative for both providers and their patients. Whenever a deviation from the norm patterns is detected, SB systems send the alerts to family members and the caregivers in order for them to take urgent response action. By using big data analytics and ML algorithms it is possible to analyze large-scale data contained in electronic medical records—e.g., to learn automatically how physicians treat patients including the drugs they prescribe [250]. Some prominent projects in this space are described next. Chernbumroong et al. [56] proposed an activity recognition and classification approach for detecting daily living activities of the elderly people applying SVM. They used wrist-worn multi-sensors namely accelerometer, temperature sensor and altimeter for detection basic five activities namely feeding, grooming, dressing, mobility, and stairs. And other instrumental activities such as washing dishes, ironing, sweeping and watching TV. Taleb et al. [251] proposed a middleware-level solution that integrates both the sensing and the monitoring services for assisting elders at smart homes environment. The appliances used in the proposed framework include RFID readers that cover of the whole building, sound sensors, video cameras, smart door lock, microphone and speakers for interaction with the system. CAALYX [252] is a European Commission-funded project that supports older people’s autonomy and self-confidence. The service is formed of three distinct subsystems including elderly monitoring subsystem, home monitoring subsystem and the caretaker’s monitoring subsystem. The system delivers a high priority message to an emergency service including the geographic position and clinical condition of the elder user. EasyLine+ [253] project funded by the European Commission to support elderly people with or without disabilities in carrying out a longer independent life at home. The system uses a neural network, assistive software, and a variety of sensors such as illumination sensor, temperature sensor, door sensors, and RFID giving the capacity of controlling the white goods. Hossain et al. [254] proposed a cloud-based cyber-physical multi-sensory smart home framework for elderly people that supports gesture-based appliance control. Suryadevara et al. [255] proposed a model for generating sensor activity pattern and predicting the behavior of an elderly person using household appliances. b: Energy Efficiency When temperatures rise or fall in various zones of your home, heaters, air conditioners, fans, and other devices will turn on or off (or increase or decrease in speed or temperature). In order to perform an efficient energy consumption of the supply systems, a significant step that is necessary by analyzing the way that current energy consuming system is using in buildings [256]. In the last decade, analysis of the energy efficiency in the smart spaces has received increasing attention. Various approaches for energy efficiency have been proposed utilizing predictive modeling based on profile, climate data, and building characteristics [32], [257]. For instance, lights throughout your home might turn on and off depending on the time of day. In the past, various attempts have been made to improve energy efficiency in the SBs through the use of smart metering and sensor networks at the residential level facilities. It is a fact that these types of infrastructure are becoming more widespread but due to their variety and size, they cannot be directly utilized to make conclusions that help to improve the energy efficiency. ML approaches will be the key to the handling of energy efficiency problem in SBs. Learning about the occupants’ consumption habits is capable of generating collaborative consumption predictions that help the occupant to consume better [258]. Some prominent projects in this space are described next. Reinisch et al. [259] developed an optimized application of AI system for SB environment. The system focuses on some capabilities like ubiquity, context awareness, conflict resolution, and self-learning features. The system operates on a knowledge base that stores all the information needed to fulfill the goals of energy efficiency and user comfort. Jahn et al. [260] proposed an energy efficiency features system built on top of a Hydra middleware framework [261]. The system provides both, stationary and mobile user interfaces for monitoring and controlling a smart environment. Pan et al. [262] proposed an IoT framework that uses smartphone platform and cloud-computing technologies to improve the energy efficiency in SBs. They built an experimental testbed for energy consumption data analysis. Fensel et al. [263] proposed the SESAME-S project (SEmantic SmArt Metering - Services for energy efficient houses). The project focuses on designing and evaluating the energy efficiency services to enable the end-consumers in making the right decisions and controlling their energy consumption. The system combines a variety of smart building components, such as smart meters, a variety of sensors, actuators, and simulators that can integrate virtual appliances such as the washing machine. Vastardis et al. [264] proposed a user-centric smart-home gateway system architecture to support home-automation, energy usage management, and smart-grid operations. The gateway is supported by ML classification algorithms component such as C4.5 and RIPPER that is able to extract behavioral patterns of the users and feed them back to the gateway. Irrigation systems monitoring and smart watering system that keep track of rain and soil conditions and irrigate appropriately are a very cost-effective way to reduce outdoor water consumption. Investment in water management software and services, water-efficient plumbing, and irrigation management delivers economic and sustainability benefits. Water conservation and management is an example of such benefits [265]. c: Comfort/Entertainment One of the main goals of SB research is to facilitate user daily life activities by increasing their satisfaction and comfort level. SBs supports automated appliance control and assistive services to offer a better quality of life. They utilize context awareness techniques to optimize the occupant’s comfort based on predefined constraints of conditions in a building environment. Typical examples of comfort services include lighting, background music, automation of routine activities, advanced user interfaces based on voice or gestures, etc. [30]. Other services related to comfort services in SB environments are Indoor Climate Control and Intelligent Thermostat [265]. Indoor Climate Control: Measurement and control of temperature, lighting, CO2 fresh air. In the SB environment, HVAC systems play an essential role in forming indoor environmental quality. Typically, HVAC systems are produced not only to heat and cool the air but also to draw in and circulate outdoor air in large buildings [266]. Kabir et al. [267] present a context-aware application that provides the service according to a predefined preference of a user. They use the KNN classifier to infer the predefined service that will maximize the user’s comfort and safety while requiring minimum explicit interaction of the user with the environment. Ahn et al. [268] proposed a deep learning model that estimates periodically the atmospheric changes and predict the indoor air quality of the near future. d: Safety/Security As the SB technology progresses, the role of ML and deep learning in security and connected devices will increase. Deep learning will continue to help gain insights using big data that were previously inaccessible, particularly in image and video. Advanced technologies such as behavioral analysis and ML to detect, categorize, and block new threats will be beneficial. In a traditional home system, as soon as a fire is detected the Fire/smoke detectors are activated and start sending a fire alarm. However, SB can perform much better than the traditional system. It not only sends an alarm but also turns on the light only in the safest route and guides the occupants of the building out, as well as it will unlock the doors and windows for smoke ventilation, turn off all the devices and call the nearest fire service station. Other than this, it can take video of the areas surrounding the building, provide the status of window breakage alarms, and automatically lock all the doors and the windows when the last person of the house leaves [30]. The main services for security and safety in SBs are: Perimeter Access Control, Liquid Presence, Intelligent Fire Alarm, Intrusion Detection, and Motion Detection Systems [265]. Perimeter Access Control service provides control to restricted areas and detects non-authorized users that access the areas. Access card provides a variety of solutions that allow staff members, vendors or contractors to access specific areas at specific times you designate. The same access card can also be utilized to check employee attendance. In addition, there is widespread use of biometric technology including fingerprint, facial recognition, and iris scans [269]. Additionally, liquid presence detection technique has been utilized in data centers, warehouses, and sensitive building grounds to prevent breakdowns and corrosion in such areas [270]. Intelligent Fire Alarm and its corresponding safety systems are crucial parts of an intelligent building. It is a system with multi-function sensors (i.e., chemical gas sensors, integrated sensor systems, and computer vision systems) These sensors enable measuring smoke and carbon monoxide (CO) levels in the building. They also can give warnings, howling alarms, and tell with a human voice about the place and level of smoke and CO. In addition, they can give a message on a smartphone if the smoke or the CO alarm goes off [271]. Examples of intrusion detection systems including window and door opening detection and intrusion prevention [265]. An infrared motion sensor is utilized to detect the motion in a specific area in the building. This sensor can reliably send alerts to the alarm panel, with the system implementing algorithms for adaption to environmental disturbances and reducing any false alarms [265]. Image recognition solution can be used in security software to identify people, places, objects, and more. It can also be used to detect unusual patterns and activities. Clarifai [272] specializes in a field of ML known as “computer vision” that teaches computers to “see” images and video. Clarifai’s technology can play a key role in security surveillance and at present, the company works only with home security. Each image is processed on a pixel by pixel basis through convoluted neural networks. Bangali and Shaligram [273] proposed a home security system that monitors the home when the user is away from the place. The system is composed of two methods: one uses a web camera to detect the intruder—whenever there is a motion detected in front of the camera, a security alert in terms of sound and an email is delivered to the occupant. And the other one is based on GSM technology that sends SMS. A home security system that sends alert messages to the house owner and police station in case of illegal invasion at home is proposed in [274]. The system consists of different sensor nodes as the input components while the output components respond to the signal received from the input components. The sensor nodes consist of a thief alarm, presence detecting circuit, and the break-in camera. Zhao and Ye [275] proposed a wireless home security system that utilizes low cost, low power consumption, and GSM/GPRS. The system has a user interface and it can respond to alarm incidents. e: Miscellaneous Projects CASAS [178] is a project by Washington State University that provides a noninvasive assistive environment for dementia patients at SBs. The project focuses on three main areas for SBs: medical monitoring, green living, and general comfort. CASAS project comprises of three layers: physical layer, middleware layer, and software applications layer. Aware Home Research Initiative (AHRI) [276] is a project that has constructed by a group at the Georgia Institute of Technology for SB services in the fields of health and well-being, digital media and entertainment, and sustainability. AHRI utilizes a variety of sensors such as smart floor sensors, it also utilizes assistive robots for monitoring and helping the elderly. House_n [277] is a multi-disciplinary project leads by a group of researchers at the MIT. The main objective of the project is to facilitate the design of the smart home and its associated technologies, products, and services. The home is supplied with hundreds of various sensors that are installed almost in every part of the home that and being utilized to develop user interface applications that enable the users to control and monitor their environment, save resources, remain mentally and physically active, and stay healthy. The EasyLiving project [278] at Microsoft Research is concerned with the development of a prototype architecture and technologies to aggregate diverse devices into a coherent user experience for intelligent environments. The EasyLiving project was designed to provide context-aware computing services. The project utilizes a variety of sensors and cameras to track and recognize the human activities in the room by using the geometric model of a room and taking readings from sensors installed in the room. The Gator Tech Smart House project [279] is a programmable space specifically designed for the elderly and disabled developed by The University of Florida’s mobile and pervasive computing laboratory. The project’s goal is to create SB environments that can sense themselves and their residents. The project provides special cognitive services for the residents such as mobility, health, and other age-related impairments. A generic middleware is utilized to integrate system components in order to maintain a service definition for every sensor and actuator in the building. The components of the middleware including separate physical, sensor platform, service, knowledge, context management, and application layers [280]. Other well-known smart home projects include DOMUS [281] which is a research project, by the University of Sherbrooke in Canada, that supports mobile computing and cognitive assistance in smart buildings. The project aims to assist people suffering from Alzheimer’s type dementia, schizophrenia, cranial trauma, or intellectual deficiencies. Adaptive House project [136] at The University of Colorado has constructed a prototype system that is equipped with a variety of sensors that provide different environmental information including sound, motion, temperature, light levels. In addition, actuators that control the space and water heaters; lighting units, and ceiling fans. In Asia, there are also some other smart building projects have been developed, such as “Welfare Techno House” project, which is equipped with different sensors such as ECG, body weight, and other temperature measured indicators [282]. Ubiquitous Home project [283] is another smart building project in Japan, which utilizes RFID, PIR, pressure sensors, as well as cameras and microphones for monitoring elderly adults. Summary: Recently, several different context-aware and ML techniques have been utilized to support SB services. ML-based approaches are capable to perform better prediction and adaptation than others. The philosophy behind ML is to automate the learning process that enables algorithms to create analytical models with the support of available data. ML can be applied in different learning styles including supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, as well as reinforcement learning when the learning is the result of the interaction between a model and the environment. The general uses of ML for SB services are detection, recognition, prediction, and optimization. In the section, we also talked about how to acquire the context from multiple distributed and heterogeneous sources and the techniques for modeling and processing such context to be used in the application services of SBs. We also talked about the most used tools and platforms ML and others for real-time data analytics by ML community to efficiently process and learn from big data. Without such ML tools, one would have to implement all of the techniques from scratch requiring expertise in the techniques and in efficient engineering practices. SECTION VI. Open Issues and Future Research Directions Research on SBs has made great strides in recent years, but a number of challenges remain. We present some major challenges related to SBs in this part of the work. These challenges will channelize the research directions for future SBs. A. Security and Privacy Wherever there is an interconnection of two systems or networks (wired or wireless), there are issues of security and privacy and the same is true in the case of SB. Security is an essential role in SB environments. Any SB application should ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data. Access control must be included in SB systems, for instance, the unauthorized users should not be able to disconnect the alarm system by connecting the pervasive system [284]. There is a massive amount of streaming that is collected from the various installed sensors and appliances, such data needs to be processed and stored. Hence, cloud computing services can be utilized for this purpose. However, with all of this data that is transmitted, the issue of losing the privacy increases. Therefore, different encryption techniques are needed to preserve personal privacy [285]. There are specific challenges related to the user’s privacy including challenges related to the data privacy of personal information and the privacy of the individual’s physical location and tracking. That needs for privacy enhancement technologies and relevant protection laws and tools for identity management of users and objects [286]. The recent trend of ML research has focused on handling security and privacy issues in SB environments. There are different security-related services have utilized ML techniques, such as determining safe device behavior by detecting and blocking activities and potentially harmful behavior [287]. ML techniques have the potential to reduce security gap because of their capability to learn, identify and detect the users’ habits and behaviors. Consequently, it can detect the abnormal behaviors predicting risks and intrusions before they happen. For instance, ML models learn the routine of the users, such as the time they get home or go to sleep. These models can suggest rules based on those detected behaviors from all connected devices [288]. B. SBS and Context-Aware Computing In the SB environment, there exists a massive amount of raw data being continuously collected about the various human activities and behaviors. It is important to develop techniques that convert this raw data into valuable knowledge [289]. Context awareness and ML techniques are expected to provide great support to process and store big data and create important knowledge from all this data [290]. The process of data interpretation and knowledge extraction has the following challenges including addressing noisy real-world data and the ability to develop further inference techniques that do not have the limitations of traditional algorithms. Usually, It is very complex to formalize and model the contextual information related to human behaviors in a standard way due to the complex physiological, psychological and behavioral aspects of human beings [291]. The humans communicate through rich languages as well as gestures and expressions. Modern ubiquitous computer systems lack an automatic mechanism of inferring information as the humans do. New research is necessary to raise human activities and behaviors recognition to understand the complex dependencies between the apps and humans [292], [293]. The context-aware prompting systems have essential applications in SBs such as emergency notifications, medication prompting, heart rate monitoring, generation of agenda reminders, and weather alerts. However, issuing prompts for all detected errors can possibly be false positives, and consequently, lead to annoyance and sometimes prove to be unsafe for specific activities. ML methods can be used for an accurate and precise prediction when a person faces difficulty while doing daily life activities [294]. C. Personal Data Stream Management in SBS The data streaming management system is able to process and transfer raw data collected from a variety of sensors to information, it is also able to fuse this information to a feature and directly process features [295]. While the data processing for a single SB is simple, it is more complex when processing the data from multiple SBs, because there are different people that tend to share less common interests and have opposing interests concerning the processed data [296]. The simple sensors in an SB environment can detect different events related to temperature, motion, light, or weather. Moreover, other appliances like a television and a telephone can also send their status or other data as events. All this data from different sensors can be used by SB services to detect specific states and send a request to some actuators according to specific predefined rules, for instance, turn on the light if the television is used [297]. However, this approach is not generalizable in case of a group of people residing in the same building. Although it can work well for one certain person when personal preferences can be automatically learned for an individual person, therefore each of the residents has to define their own set of rules [298]. Because of the increasing number of sensors that produce data streams, the traditional analyzing and processing techniques of these data streams are mostly impractical now [299]. Despite the availability of new tools and systems for handling massive amounts of data continuously generating by a variety of sensors in SBs, however, the real promise of advanced data analytics to still lies beyond the realm of pure technology [296]. In [300] discuses research challenges for data streams of real-world applications. They analyze issues concerning privacy, timing, preprocessing, relational and event streams, model complexity and evaluation, availability of information, and problems related to legacy systems. D. Big Data Challenges in SBS Nowadays, a variety of sensing technology in the SBs can be utilized to collect a massive amount of heterogeneous data at a reasonable cost. Typically, hundreds of thousands of transactions can be generated by a single SB every day. The process of storing this data over the long-term is challenging [258]. We can imagine the challenges and opportunities that the companies or government will encounter in the future to manage incoming data from dozens of SBs. This new data could provide us with more contextual information that consequently leads to much better services to the occupants [301]. In the world of big data, despite the availability massive amount of data, however, it is not necessarily easy to obtain valuable information from this data utilizing the traditional approaches like trial and error to extract meaningful information from this data. Analyzing these massive amounts of data requires new technologies to store, organize, and process big data effectively, it needs high-performance processors that enable uncovering the insights in big data. It also requires flexible cloud computing services and virtualization techniques, as well as software such as Apache Hadoop and Spark [302]. It requires providing appropriate ML techniques which differ from the traditional approaches for effective and efficient solution of the above issues. For these reasons, researchers have recently started to think about the problems and opportunities resulting from the adoption of big data in SB environments [303], [304]. The information extracted from this big data has significant value and could greatly contribute in the future of SBs as assistive tools and for better services delivery. That is why it is necessary that the researchers start to analyze and think about the solutions for the current and future challenges of big data in SBs [305]. E. Interoperability Interoperability means that two (or more) systems work together unchanged even though they were not necessarily designed to work together. When equipment, devices or appliances having different communication and networking technologies can communicate effectively, interoperability is satisfied. It is a challenge to ensure that an SB that has various components will be intelligible. Typically, each of these components might have been produced by different vendors, each of which may have created under different design constraints and considerations [306]. Therefore it becomes essential to satisfy interoperability so that a number of heterogeneous communication and networking technologies could coexist in various parts of SBs. For example, an energy management system may use Wi-Fi and ZigBee for communication purposes. A lot of work can be done in this context [307]. F. Reliability We can expect that the reliability is one of the main concern of occupants and developers of SB systems. A variety of appliances and devices present in SB such as televisions, microwave, washing machines etc. are required exceedingly to be reliable. Achieving expected levels of reliability, especially when linked with communication technologies utilized with these devices that may be expected in SBs, is a great challenge. There are different reasons for these challenges differences in technological approaches, regulations, development culture, and the expectations of the market [306]. G. Integration The key to a successful SB implementation is integration: linking building systems such as lighting, power meters, water meters, pumps, heating, and chiller plants together using sensors and control systems, and then connecting the building automation system to enterprise systems. Integration allows executives to gain smart-building benefits, both in new construction and by gradually transforming existing buildings into SBs. What these SBs have in common is integration. Generally, the integration in SB systems brings a range of benefits from energy savings to productivity gains to sustainability. The SB systems can be attached to enterprise business systems to add another level of intelligence that enhances decision-making and improves building performance [2]. However, integrating multiple systems is very challenging as each individual system has its own assumptions, strategies to control the physical world, and semantics. As an example of integrating two systems in SB, assume a system that is responsible for energy management, and another system for health care are running concurrently. In this case, the integrated system should not turn off medical appliances to save energy while they are being used as suggested by the health care system [292]. As a future perspective for SBs, You will wake up to the sound of the alarm, at the same time the available sensors will be aware that you are waking up. The other sensors such as light sensors will automatically turn on the light in the building, while the thermostat will warm the area that you are about to use in the building. Your coffee will start to brew, you will also get a notification on your phone about the weather. The other sensors in the kitchen and refrigerator will remind you with a list of items that you will need to pick up on your way from your workplace to home to make dinner. When you leave your house, you can press a button from your phone to self-drive your car out of the garage. After that, the security system will start monitoring and controlling the home. Such the doors will automatically lock. Appliances will switch to an energy-saving mode. When the home sensors sense utilizing geofencing technology that you are way back home, it will get ready again for your arrival, the thermostat will warm things up, the garage door will open as you pull up, and your favorite music will start to play when you walk in [141]. Summary: Although the recent researches have been done in the SBs field, there is a need for a lot more efforts; however, we believe that SBs are possible for the mass market in the near future. The main challenges and future research directions of this eld can be summarized as follows: User context in term of behavior and intention should be studied and respected whenever possible; Further research is needed into context-aware prompting systems, personal data streaming and big data analysis of occupants in SB environment; Some of the other challenges like the interoperability, reliability, and integration still require more attention. SECTION VII. Conclusions The promise of smart buildings (SBs) is a world of appliances that anticipate your needs and do exactly what you want them to at the touch of a button. Since SBs and their inhabitants create voluminous amounts of streaming data, SB researchers are looking towards techniques from ML and big data analytics for managing, processing, and gaining insights from this big data. This paper reviewed the most important aspects of SBs with particular focus on what is being done and what are the issues that require further research in ML and data analytics domains. In this regards, we have presented a comprehensive survey of the research works that relate to the use of ML and big data particularly for building smart infrastructure and services. Although the recent advancements in technologies that make the concept of SBs feasible, there are still a variety of challenges that limit large-scale real-world systems in SBs field. Addressing these challenges soon will be a powerful driving force for advancements in both industrial and academic fields of SB research.

  Explanation: The paper is about providing user-friendly interfaces (e.g., mobile apps, web dashboards) for farmers to input preferences, constraints, and expert knowledge into automated irrigation systems, using techniques like participatory design or user-centered design. For example, farmers can input the type of crop they're growing, the soil type, and the local climate conditions. The irrigation system can then use this information to automatically adjust the watering schedule to optimize crop yields. This reduces the need for farmers to manually manage the irrigation system and can lead to increased productivity and water savings.

Abstract Agriculture is considered one of the most important sectors that play a strategic role in ensuring food security. However, with the increasing world's population, agri-food demands are growing — posing the need to switch from traditional agricultural methods to smart agriculture practices, also known as agriculture 4.0. To fully benefit from the potential of agriculture 4.0, it is significant to understand and address the problems and challenges associated with it. This study, therefore, aims to contribute to the development of agriculture 4.0 by investigating the emerging trends of digital technologies in the agricultural industry. For this purpose, a systematic literature review based on Protocol of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses is conducted to analyse the scientific literature related to crop farming published in the last decade. After applying the protocol, 148 papers were selected and the extent of digital technologies adoption in agriculture was examined in the context of service type, technology readiness level, and farm type. The results have shown that digital technologies such as autonomous robotic systems, internet of things, and machine learning are significantly explored and open-air farms are frequently considered in research studies (69%), contrary to indoor farms (31%). Moreover, it is observed that most use cases are still in the prototypical phase. Finally, potential roadblocks to the digitization of the agriculture sector were identified and classified at technical and socio-economic levels. This comprehensive review results in providing useful information on the current status of digital technologies in agriculture along with prospective future opportunities.

A global food security problem Food security is a multidimensional concept that alleviates hunger by ensuring a sustainable, nutritious food supply. It is characterized by a four-pillar model shown in Fig. 1, with each pillar intrinsic to ensure food security [1].

Due to several anthropogenic factors, such as rapid population growth, urbanization, industrialization, farmland loss, freshwater scarcity, and environmental degradation, food security is becoming a serious global issue. This is because these factors are also directly impacting agricultural industry which is a primary source of agri-food production around the world. It is anticipated that by 2050 global population will be increased from the current 7.7 billion to 9.2 billion, urban population will be rise by 66%, arable land will be declined by approximately 50 million hectares, global GHG emissions (source of CO2 – promote crop disease and pest growth) will be increased by 50%, agri-food production will be declined by 20%, and eventually, food demand will be increased by 59 to 98% – posing an imminent threat to food security and adequate food availability [2], [3], [4]. To satisfy the increasing food demands, agricultural practitioners worldwide will need to maximise the agricultural productivity involving crop and livestock farming. In this review paper, the focus is on crop farming that involves cultivation of both food and cash crops. A typical agri-food value chain depicting three primary stages, namely pre-field (pre-plantation stage), in-field (plantation and harvesting stage), and post-field (post-harvesting stage) involved in the production of agricultural products is shown in Fig. 2. All the stages play a vital role in the value chain but, in this review, the second stage ˝in-field˝ will be considered that involves several crop growing processes such as plowing, sowing, spraying, and harvesting, etc. These processes currently employ traditional agricultural practices that are labor-intensive, require arable land, time, and a substantial amount of water (for irrigation) – making it a challenge to produce enough agri-food [5]. A part of problem is also related to irregular use of pesticides and herbicides and misuse of available technology which cause harm to crop and eventually resulting in agricultural wastes [6]. These issues can be addressed by integrating sophisticated technologies and computer-based applications that ensure high crop yield, less water consumption, optimised pesticide/herbicide utilization, and enhanced crop quality. This is where the smart agriculture concept comes in. 1.2. Smart agriculture Industry 4.0, also known as the fourth industrial revolution, is revolutionizing, and reshaping every industry. It is a strategic initiative characterized by a fusion of emerging disruptive digital technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), big data and analytics (BDA), system integration (SI), cloud computing (CC), simulation, autonomous robotic systems (ARS), augmented reality (AR), artificial intelligence (AI), wireless sensor networks (WSN), cyber-physical system (CPS), digital twin (DT), and additive manufacturing (AM) to enable the digitization of the industry [7]. The integration of these technologies in agriculture is sparking the next generation industrial agriculture, namely, agriculture 4.0 – also termed smart agriculture, smart farming, or digital farming [7]. Smart agriculture provides farmers with a diverse set of tools (shown in Fig. 3) to address several agricultural food production challenges associated with farm productivity, environmental impact, food security, crop losses, and sustainability. For instance, with IoT-enabled systems consisting of WSNs, farmers can connect to farms remotely irrespective of place and time to monitor and control farm operations. Drones equipped with hyperspectral cameras can be used to collect data from heterogeneous sources on farmlands and autonomous robots can be used to support or accomplish repetitive tasks at farms. Data analytics techniques can be employed to analyze the gathered data with computer applications can be used to assist farmers in decision-making process. Likewise, a wide variety of parameters related to environmental factors, weed control, crop production status, water management, soil conditions, irrigation scheduling, herbicides, and pesticides, and controlled environment agriculture can be monitored and analyzed in smart agriculture to increase crop yields, minimize costs, enhance product quality, and maintain process inputs through the use of modern systems [8].

Research motivation and contribution The motivation for preparing this review stems from the fact that digital technologies in agricultural systems offer new strategic solutions for enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of farms’ production. Moreover, digital transformation provides a way forward to implement modern farming practices such as vertical farming (hydroponics, aquaponics and aeroponics), which has the potential to overcome food security problems. But there is a set of problems and limitations associated with this transformation from the technical, socio-economic, and management standpoint that must be death to fully exploit the potential of agriculture 4.0 [9]. There are number of studies that have discussed emerging trends in the development of agriculture 4.0 by providing succinct information on key applications, advantages, and corresponding research challenges of smart farming [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18]. The research focus of these studies is limited to either explaining more generic technical aspects while paying attention to only one or few digital technologies, and/or enhancing agricultural supply chain performance, and/or developing agriculture 4.0 definition, and/or achieving sustainable agronomy through precision agriculture, and/or proposing a smart farming framework. Nevertheless, these studies do not involve explicit discussion on the tools and techniques used to develop different systems and maturity level of these systems. There is also a lack of studies considering modern soilless farms such as hydroponics, aquaponics and aeroponics (indoor/outdoor) and implications of digital technologies in these farms. Hence, it is necessary to analyse the evolution of agriculture 4.0 from different perspectives to stimulate the discussion in the area. This study aims to present a holistic overview of digital technologies implemented in second stage of agricultural production value chain (in-field) for different types of farms as mentioned in section 1.1. The main theoretical contribution of the study involves analysis and dissemination of the tools and techniques employed, the farm type, the maturity level of the developed systems, along with potential roadblocks or inhibiting factors in development of agriculture 4.0. The reflections presented in the review will support researchers and agricultural practitioner in future research on agriculture 4.0. 1.4. Paper organization Following the introduction, the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses the approach used to gather the relevant literature; then, Section 3 presents the statistical results obtained after a general analysis of the selected research studies; next, Section 4 provides a detailed overview of the core technologies used in the digitization of agriculture; after, Section 5 highlights the technical and socio-economic roadblocks to digital integration in agriculture; next, Section 6 outlines a discussion about the research questions followed by added value, considerations and future prospects related to agricultural digitization, and transition to agriculture 5.0; and lastly, Section 8 concludes the review. 2. Research methodology A systematic literature review (SLR) is a tool used to manage the diverse knowledge and identify research related to a predetermined topic [19]. In this study, SLR is conducted to investigate the status of Industry 4.0 technologies in agricultural industry. Particularly, cases are searched where the term ‘agriculture’ appeared concurrently in the title, abstract, or keywords of an article with any of the ‘Industry 4.0 technologies” mentioned in section 1.2. Before conducting the SLR, a review protocol is defined to ensure a transparent and high-quality research process, which are the characteristics that make a literature review systematic [20]. The review protocol also helps to minimize bias by conducting exhaustive literature searches. This includes three steps: the formulation of the research questions, the definition of the search strategy, and the specification of inclusion and exclusion criteria. This paper uses a preferred reporting item for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA) approach to conduct SLR. PRISMA is an evidence-based minimum set of items that are used to guide the development process of systematic literature reviews and other meta-analyses [19]. 2.1. Review protocol A review protocol (in Table 1) is defined before conducting the bibliographic analysis to identify, evaluate, and interpret results relevant to the research scope. First, research questions are formulated to provide insight into the analysis of published studies in the research area of interest from different dimensions. These questions need to be answered in the study. Next, the search strategy is defined, which helps identify appropriate keywords later in the search equation to identify the relevant information sources, such as academic databases and search engines that provide access to a massive amount of digital documentation. Three online research repositories are used to retrieve relevant studies: ScienceDirect1, Scopus2, and IEEE Xplore3. Finally, to refine the search results of each database, boundaries are set by predefining inclusion and exclusion criteria for further investigation and content assessments of selected publications. It involves, for instance, defining the time interval for the research process from 2011 to 2021 to limit the studies to those published in English, disregarding chapters of books and grey literature, such as reports and summaries of events and seminars. These last two steps of the review protocol allow the preliminary filtering of metadata sources and narrow down the scope of research. Table 1. Review protocol for systematic literature review. Review questions RQ1: Which Industry 4.0 technologies have been used in the literature for digitization of agriculture? RQ2: How and to what extent have these technologies been applied in the context of service type, tools and techniques used, system's maturity level, and farm type? RQ3: What are the primary roadblocks in implementation of Industry 4.0 technologies for smart farming? Study selection criteria Inclusion criteria: • Peer-reviewed journal articles and conference papers. • Studies published during the period between 2011 and 2021. • Studies should provide answers to the research questions. • The article must include the title, year, source, abstract, and DOI. • Literature focussing on application of Industry 4.0 technologies in crop plantation and harvesting activities particularly in-field processes. Exclusion criteria: • Summaries of events and seminars, book review, and editorial. • Literature focusing on application of Industry 4.0 technologies in livestock farming; pre-field processes such as genetic development, seed development and seed supplying; post-field stages such as crop distribution, food processing and consumption; and agri-food supply chain. • Studies published before 2011. • The publication is not available in full text. • The publication is not in English. Literature search Sources: Scopus, ScienceDirect, and IEEE Xplore for academic literature, citations in identified literature Search equation: (("agriculture*") AND ("Industry 4.0" OR “Digital Farming” OR “Intelligent Farming” OR “Smart Agriculture” OR “Agriculture 4.0” OR “Smart Farming” OR “Internet of Things” OR “IoT” OR “Cloud Computing” OR “Edge Computing” OR “Wireless Sensor Networks*” OR “Artificial Intelligence*” OR “Big Data*” OR “Data Analytics*” OR “Data Science*” OR “Cyber Physical System*” OR “Robotics*” OR “Computer Vision*” OR “Machine Learning*” OR “Deep Learning*” OR “Data Integration*”)) 2.2. Evaluation process The evaluation of the literature search process is done in four stages: identification, screening, eligibility, and inclusion, as detailed by the PRISMA flow diagram shown in Fig. 4. After initial metadata filtering through the application of search expression, a total of 3165 records are found (1690 from Scopus, 926 from ScienceDirect, and 549 from IEEE Xplore), which are then consolidated for the removal of duplicate items in the identification stage. The number of publications after this step is reduced to 2876. In the screening stage, the titles and abstracts of the papers are analyzed, and only 498 papers are selected for integral reading. In the third stage, full-text screening of these articles is performed to verify their eligibility in relation to the objective of this paper, which is to answer the research questions mentioned in Table 1. Of the 498 papers, 137 are found to be relevant for this review. Another 11 are added through a cross-referencing approach, adding up to 148 papers selected in the final stage for further analysis.

Threats to validity i SLR replication: The presented SLR is susceptible to threats to validity because the current search is limited to only three online repositories. More publications could potentially be found if additional sources were explored. The process of SLR is described clearly in sub-sections 2.1 and 2.2, and hence, validity can be considered well addressed. However, in the case of replication of this SLR, it is possible that one can find slightly different publications. This difference would result from different personal choices during the screening and eligibility steps of PRISMA, but it is highly unlikely that the overall findings would change. ii Search string: the search string used to find the relevant studies cover the whole scope of SLR, but there is a possibility that valuable studies might have been missed. Additional keywords and synonyms with a broader search might return more studies. 3. Digitization trends in agriculture The year-wise distribution of the 148 articles from 2011 to 2021 is represented in Fig. 5. Around 22% of the scientific publications in the last ten years were published in 2018. This reflects that the agricultural industry is making considerable progress in the context of the implementation of digital technologies, but the pace is still slow as compared to other domains such as healthcare, manufacturing, mining, automotive, energy, etc.,[15].

The breakdown of these publications with respect to digital technologies (mentioned in sub-section 1.2) and targeted farm types is represented in Fig. 6. Download : Download high-res image (321KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 6. Technology-wise distribution of the 148 selected research studies. The farm type refers to the crop farming method considered while developing an application or framework. For instance, the farming method can be soil-based or soilless. The soil-based farming category involves open-air fields (traditional outdoor agricultural farms) and greenhouse farms (indoor). On the other hand, the soilless farming category involves modern farming practices such as aquaponics, aeroponics, and hydroponics (mostly indoor). The numbers at the top of the stacked column in Fig. 6 indicate the total number of studies that have used the particular technology to develop a smart agriculture system, whereas different colors of columns indicate the respective farm types. Use cases are from these publications are analysed, and conclusions are drawn. For instance, it is found that autonomous robotics systems (including unmanned guided vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles (drones)), internet of things, and machine learning appear to be the widely applied technologies in the agricultural domain in the last decade. The same illustration suggests that big data, wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and digital twins are the emerging areas in agriculture. Moreover, open-air farms are the most frequently considered in research studies (69%), contrary to indoor farms (31%). For soilless farming systems (aquaponics, aeroponics, and hydroponics), only 22 publications are found, which insinuates that these modern farming practices are still in their infancy. Likewise, services of each use case are identified and are classified under nine different service categories, namely: i) crop management, CM (Estimation/ prediction of crop yield/ growth rate/ harvesting period and seed plantation/ harvesting/ pollination/ spraying (fertilizer/ pesticide)); ii) crop quality management, CQM (fresh weight, green biomass, height, length, width, leaf density, piment content (chlorophyll) and phytochemical composition); iii) water and environment management, WEM (monitoring and control of flow rate, water level, water quality (nutrients), temperature, humidity, CO2, and weather forecast etc.); iv) irrigation management, IM (water stress detection and scheduling); v) farm management, FM (monitoring of farm operations, tracking and counting products, determining production efficiency, financial analysis, energy consumption analysis, technology integration and decisions implementation); vi) pest and disease management, PDM (pest identification and disease detection); vii) soil management, SM (moisture content, soil nutrients, fertilizer needs and application); viii) weed and unwanted vegetation management, WUVM (weed/unknown vegetation mapping, classification, and herbicides application); and ix) fruit detection and counting, FDC — as shown in Fig. 7. These categories illustrate the role of different digital technologies in smart farming. Upon analysis, it is found that crop management parameters, such as crop yield prediction, growth rate estimation, or evaluation of harvesting period are the most frequently researched areas for agriculture 4.0 in the last decade (29%), whereas very little heed is paid towards soil management (2%), fruit detection and counting (2%), and crop quality management (3%).

Service-wise distribution of selected research studies: The technology readiness level (TRL) of all the use cases is examined using European Union's TRL scale that partitions system's maturity level into three generic levels [21]. The first level is conceptual, that represents European TRL 1–2 (use case is in conceptual phase), the second level is the prototype, which means European TRL 3–6 (use case is working even without the complete planned functionality), and the third level is deployed, that includes European TRL 7–9 (use case is mature with all the possible functions). Fig. 8 depicts the TRL of each use case developed in selected studies. It is observed that little progress has been made in advancing smart agricultural systems beyond the concept and prototype levels to the commercial level. For instance, most use cases (129) are at the prototype level. Download : Download high-res image (269KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 8.

Agriculture 4.0 enabling technologies This section provides critical insights towards answering RQ1 and RQ2 from Table 1. 4.1. Internet of Things driven agricultural systems Internet of things (IoT) refers to a cosmos of interrelated computing devices, sensors, appliances, and machines connected with the internet, each having unique identities and capabilities for performing remote sensing and monitoring [21]. The reference architecture of IoT with six layers, namely perception layer (hardware devices), network layer (communication), middleware layer (device management and interoperability), service layer (cloud computing), application layer (data integration and analytics), and end-user layer (user-interface), is shown in Fig.9. In the agricultural domain, IoT devices in the physical layer gather data related to environmental and crop parameters such as temperature, humidity, pH value, water level, leaf color, fresh leaf weight, etc. The transmission of this data takes place in the network layer, the design of which depends on the selection of suitable communication technologies relevant to the field size, farm location, and type of farming method. For instance, ZigBee, LoRa, and Sigfox are widely used and employed in outdoor fields because they are cheaper and have low energy consumption and a good transmission range [22,23]. Despite being a secure technology, Bluetooth is only used in indoor farms as it offers a short transmission range [22]. Wi-Fi is not a promising technology for agricultural applications due to its high costs and high energy consumption [22]. RFID (radio frequency identification) and NFC (near field communication) technologies, on the other hand, are increasingly being implemented in agricultural systems for tracking agricultural products [24]. GPRS or mobile communication technology (2G, 3G, and 4G) are used for periodic monitoring of environmental and soil parameters. In addition, communication protocols mostly used in the agricultural scenarios are HTTP, WWW, and SMTP. Likewise, to ensure interoperability and system security to their context-aware functionalities, middleware HYDRA and SMEPP are mostly employed in agricultural systems [25]. To store data, cloud computing techniques are employed in the service layer. This data is then used in the application layer to build smart applications used by farmers, agriculture experts, and supply chain professionals to enhance farm monitoring capacity and productivity.

The integration of IoT in agriculture is meant to empower farmers with the decision tools and automation technologies that seamlessly integrate knowledge, products, and services to achieve high productivity, quality, and profit. A multitude of studies is performed and put forward concerning the incubation of the IoT concepts in the agricultural sector. The main findings of some of the studies are presented in Table 2. Multiple technological issues and architectural problems have been addressed through the development of IoT-based agricultural systems. But most of these systems are either in a conceptual stage or in a prototype form (not commercial) at the moment. Focus is mainly laid on-farm management, irrigation control, crop growth, health monitoring, and disease detection. Some of these studies have also explained IoT implementation in modern agricultural systems such as vertical farming (soilless farming - aquaponics, hydroponics, and aeroponics) and greenhouse farming (soil-based). Moreover, most studies have focused on addressing a specific problem. Table 2. IoT-driven agricultural systems.

Wireless sensor networks in agriculture Wireless sensor network (WSN) is regarded as a technology that is used within an IoT system. It can be defined as a group of spatially distributed sensors for monitoring the physical conditions of the environment, temporarily storing the collected data, and transmitting the gathered information at a central location [22]. The general architecture of WSN is shown in Fig. 10. A WSN for smart farming is made up of numerous sensor nodes connected through a wireless connection module. These nodes have a variety of abilities (e.g., processing, transmission, and sensation) that allow them to self-organize, self-configure, and self-diagnose. There are different types of WSNs, which are categorized depending on the environment where they are deployed. These include terrestrial wireless sensor networks (TWSNs), wireless underground sensor networks (WUSNs), underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs), wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSNs), and mobile wireless sensor networks (MWSNs) [55]. In agricultural applications, TWSN and UWSN are widely used. In TWSNs, the nodes are deployed above the ground surface, consisting of sensors for gathering the surrounding data. The second variant of WSNs is its underground counterpart – WUSNs, where sensor nodes are planted inside the soil. In this setting, lower frequencies easily penetrate through the soil, whereas higher frequencies suffer severe attenuation [56]. Therefore, the network requires a higher number of nodes to cover a large area because of the limited communication radius. Many research articles are available in the literature that discusses the use of WSN for different outdoor and indoor farms’ applications such as irrigation management, water quality assessment, and environmental monitoring. A summary of some of these articles is given in Table 3. These studies have focused on developing WSNs architectures that are simplified, low cost, energy-efficient and scalable. Yet, various factors associated with WSNs need further attention, such as minimum maintenance, robust and fault-tolerant architecture, and interoperability.

Cloud computing in agriculture According to the National Institute of Standard and Technologies (NIST), cloud computing (CC) is defined as a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction [67]. The main architecture of CC shown in Fig. 11 is comprised of four layers: datacenter (hardware), infrastructure, platform, and application [68]. Each of these layers is linked with specific cloud service models, which are classified as software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a service (IaaS). Cloud computing has gained great attention over the past decade in the agriculture sector because it provides: 1) inexpensive storage services for data gathered from different domains through WSNs and other preconfigured IoT devices, 2) large-scale computing systems to perform intelligent decision-making by transforming this raw data into useful knowledge, and 3) a secure platform to develop agricultural IoT applications [69]. In combination with IoT and WSN, CC is employed to develop different agricultural applications, most of which are presented in Tables 2 and 3. CC technology is also used to create operational farm management systems (FMSs) to support farmers and farm managers in efficient monitoring of farm operations Table 4. presents the salient features of some of these FMSs. Another topic of interest that is being explored in global research is related to the traceability of agri-product quality [70]. But only preliminary research has been attempted to explore traceability compliance with standards of food safety and quality.

Self-leveling scale, control box, LCD display, and RFID tags Open-air Conceptual [74] The cloud-based agricultural systems have the potential to solve problems of increasing food demands, environmental pollution caused by excessive use of pesticides and fertilizers, and the safety of agricultural products. These FMSs, however, do not have the capability to support run-time customization in relation to distinct requirements of farmers. Moreover, because most farm data is usually fragmented and dispersed, it is difficult to record farm activities properly in current FMSs applications [75]. 4.4. Edge/fog computing in agriculture The rapid development of IoT has led to the explosive growth of sensors and smart devices, generating large volumes of data. The processing and analysis of such an enormous amount of data in real-time are challenging because it increases the load on the cloud server and also reduces the response speed. Simply using a cloud server is not able to provide real-time response while handling such a large data set. Additionally, IoT applications are sensitive to network latency because they require a constant exchange of information between devices and the cloud, making CC unfeasible to handle these applications [23]. The emergence of the edge computing concept can resolve the problems associated with CC. This new computing model deploys computing and storage resources (such as cloudlets or fog nodes) at the edge of the network closer to data sources such as mobile devices or sensors. This way, it can facilitate real-time analytics while keeping data secure on the device [23]. Edge computing offers intriguing possibilities for smart agriculture, but the applications of this technology are only in their infancy in agricultural systems. Hence, few research studies are available in this area; see Table 5. Most of the edge computing-based agricultural systems discussed in these studies are prototypical and address a limited selection of problems in various agricultural domains. So far, interoperability and scalability issues have not received sufficient consideration. Table 5. Edge computing-based agricultural systems.

Autonomous robot systems in agriculture Autonomous robot systems (ARS) are intelligent machines capable of performing tasks, making decisions, and acting in real-time, with a high degree of autonomy (without external influence or without explicit human intervention) [83]. Interest in agricultural ARS (AARS) has grown significantly in recent years because of their ability to automate some practices in outdoor and indoor farms - including seeding, watering, fertilizing, spraying, plant monitoring and phenotyping, environmental monitoring, disease detection, weed and pest controlling, and harvesting [15]. The agricultural robots use a combination of emerging technologies such as computer vision, WSNs, satellite navigation systems (GPS), AI, CC, and IoT, thereby facilitating the farmers to enhance productivity and quality of agricultural products. AARS in smart farming can be mobile AARS, which can move throughout the working field, or fixed AARS [84]. Mobile AARSs are further classified into unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) and 2) unnamed aerial vehicles (UAVs), which are explained in the following sections. 4.5.1. Unmanned ground vehicles in agriculture Unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) are agricultural robots that operate on the ground without a human operator. The main components of UGVs generally include; a platform for locomotive apparatus and manipulator, sensors for navigation, a supervisory control system, an interface for the control system, the communication links for information exchange between devices, and a system architecture for integration between hardware and software agents [85]. The control architecture of UGV can be remote-operated (controlled by a human operator via the interface) or fully autonomous (operated without the need for a human controller based on artificial intelligence technologies) [85]. Likewise, locomotive systems can be based on wheels, tracks, or legs [85]. Despite high ground adaptability, intrinsic omnidirectionality and soil protection of legged robots, they are uncommon in agriculture. However, when combined with wheels (wheel-legged robots), these robots offer a disruptive locomotion system for smart farms. In addition to their needed characteristics for infield operations, UGV should fulfill certain requirements such as small size, maneuverability, resilience, efficiency, human-friendly interface, and safety – to enhance crop yields and farm productivity. Table 6 summarizes the diverse range of UGVs designed for agricultural operations. Table 6. Different types of UGVs designed for performing agricultural tasks.

Open-air Prototype [95] Most of the agricultural robotic systems presented above have a 4WD locomotive system because it offers ease of construction and control. The drawback of 4WD is that the wheels are strongly affected by terrains containing stone elements and/or cavities [85]. Hence, it is significant to explore other mechanisms, such as legged or wheel-legged locomotive systems. Some robots have computer vision systems, but due to the difficulty of developing an accurate and reliable system that replaces manual labor, most of these robots are built with a low-cost computer vision system, that is, using conventional RGB cameras. Moreover, most of the systems mentioned above are still in the research phase, with no commercial use on a large scale. 4.5.2. Unmanned aerial vehicles in agriculture Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or aerial robots are aircrafts with no human pilot on board. Depending on the type of technology incorporated to fly (wing structure) and autonomy level, there is a wide variety of UAVs [96]. For instance, according to wing type, UAVs can be fixed-wing (planes), single-rotor (helicopter), hybrid system (vertical takeoff and landing), and multirotor (drone). Among these, drones (multi-rotor technology) which are lifted and propelled by four (quadrotor) or six (hex-rotor) rotors, have become increasingly popular in the agriculture sector due to their mechanical simplicity in comparison to helicopters, which rely on a much more sophisticated plate control mechanism [97]. Similarly, according to autonomy level, UAVs can be either teleoperated in which the pilot provides references to each actuator of the aircraft so as to control it, in the same manner, an onboard pilot would, or tele-commanded in which the aircraft relies on an automatic controller on board that is in charge of maintaining a stable flight [96]. Equipped with the appropriate sensors (vision, infrared, multispectral, and hyperspectral cameras, etc.), agricultural UAVs allow farmers to obtain data (vegetation, leaf area, and reflectance indexes) from their fields to study dynamic changes in crops that cannot be detected by scouting the ground [98]. This data permits farmers to infer information related to crop diseases, nutrient deficiencies, water level, and other crop growth parameters. With this information, farmers can plan possible remedies (irrigation, fertilization, weed control, etc.). Table 7 reviews some of the UAV-based systems used for different agricultural operations.

Other problems with these UAVs are associated with battery and flight time [96]. At the moment, lithium-ion batteries are being used because their capacity is larger than that of conventional batteries. But an increase in battery capacity increases the drone weight, and now research is undergoing to address this issue. In addition, the existing UAVs have complex user interfaces, and only experts can use them to perform agricultural tasks. By improving the user interface making it human-centered with multimodal feedback will allow people who are older or unfamiliar with UAV technology to control it more easily. 4.6. Big data and analytics in agriculture Rapid developments in IoT and CC technologies have increased the magnitude of data immeasurably. This data, also referred to as Big Data (BD), includes textual content (i.e., structured, semi-structured, and unstructured), and multimedia content (e.g., videos, images, audio) [119]. The process of examining this data to uncover hidden patterns, unknown correlations, market trends, customer preferences, and other useful information is referred to as big data analytics (BDA). Big data is typically characterized according to five dimensions defined by five Vs, which are displayed in Fig. 12 [120]. The paradigm of BD-driven smart agriculture is comparatively new, but the trend of this application is positive as it has the capacity to bring a revolutionary change in the food supply chain and food security through increased production. Agricultural big data is usually generated from various sectors and stages in agriculture, which can be collected either from agricultural fields through ground sensors, aerial vehicles, and ground vehicles using special cameras and sensors; from governmental bodies in the form of reports and regulations; from private organizations through online web services; from farmers in the form of knowledge through surveys; or from social media [120]. The data can be environmental (weather, climate, moisture level, etc.), biological (plant disease), or geo-spatial depending on the agricultural domain and differs in volume, velocity, and formats [121]. The gathered data is stored in a computer database and processed by computer algorithms for analyzing seed characteristics, weather patterns, soil properties (like pH or nutrient content), marketing and trade management, consumers’ behavior, and inventory management. A variety of techniques and tools are employed to analyze big data in agriculture. A summary of some of the studies is given in Table 8. Machine learning, cloud-based platforms, and modeling and simulation are the most commonly used techniques. Particularly, machine learning tools are used in prediction, clustering, and classification problems. Whereas cloud platforms are used for large-scale data storing, preprocessing, and visualization. There are still many potential areas that are not adequately covered in existing literature, where BDA can be applied to address various agricultural issues. For instance, these include data-intensive greenhouses and indoor vertical farming systems, quality control and health monitoring of crops in outdoor and indoor farms, genetic engineering, decision support platforms to assist farmers in the design of indoor vertical farms, and scientific models for policymakers to assist them in decision-making regarding the sustainability of the physical ecosystem. Lastly, most systems are still in the prototypical stage. Download : Download high-res image (437KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 12. Five dimensions of “Big Data”. Table 8.

Artificial intelligence in agriculture Artificial intelligence (AI) involves the development of theory and computer systems capable of performing tasks requiring human intelligence, such as sensorial perception and decision-making [126]. Combined with CC, IoT, and big data, AI, particularly in the facet of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), is regarded as one of the key drivers behind the digitization of agriculture. These technologies have the potential to enhance crop production and improve real-time monitoring, harvesting, processing, and marketing [127]. Several intelligent agricultural systems are developed that use ML and DL algorithms to determine various parameters like weed detection, yield prediction, or disease identification. These systems are discussed in the next two sub-sections. 4.7.1. Machine learning in agriculture Machine learning (ML) techniques are broadly classified into three categories: 1) supervised learning (linear regression, regression trees, non-linear regression, Bayesian linear regression, polynomial regression, and support vector regression), 2) unsupervised learning (k-means clustering, hierarchal clustering, anomaly detection, neural networks (NN), principal component analysis, independent component analysis, a-priori algorithm and singular value decomposition (SVD)); and 3) reinforcement learning (Markov decision process (MDP) and Q learning) [128]. ML techniques and algorithms are implemented in the agriculture sector for crop yield prediction, disease, and weed detection, weather prediction (rainfall), soil properties estimation (type, moisture content, pH, temperature, etc.), water management, determination of the optimal amount of fertilizer, and livestock production and management [129] Table 9. presents a list of publications where different ML algorithms are utilized for various agricultural applications. From the analysis of these articles, “crop yield prediction” is a widely explored area, and linear regression, neural network (NN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) is the most used ML techniques to enable smart farming. The presented use cases are still in the research phase with no reported commercial usage at the moment. Moreover, it is also found that AI and ML techniques are sparsely explored in the greenhouse and indoor vertical farming systems, particularly hydroponics, aquaponics, and aeroponics. There are only a few publications available summarized in the same table where ML techniques are employed. Considering the digital transformation's cyber-security and data privacy challenges, new approaches such as federated learning and privacy-preserving methods are being developed to enable digital farming [130]. These approaches build ML models from local parameters without sharing private data samples, thus mitigating security issues. Table 9. Machine learning-based agricultural systems.

Deep learning in agriculture Deep learning (DL) represents the extension of classical ML that can solve complex problems (predictions and classification) particularly well and fast because more “depth” (complexity) is added into the model. The primary advantage of DL is feature learning which involves automatic extraction of features (high-level information) from large datasets [149]. Different DL algorithms are convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long short term memory (LSTM) networks, recurrent neural (RNN) networks, generative adversarial networks (GANs), radial basis function networks (RBFNs), multilayer perceptron (MLPs), feedforward artificial neural network (ANN), self-organizing maps (SOMs), deep belief networks (DBNs), restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs), and autoencoders. A detailed description of these algorithms, popular architectures, and training platforms is available at various sources [150]. Fig. 13 illustrates an example of DL architecture of CNN [151]. In the agriculture sector, DL algorithms are mostly used to solve problems associated with computer vision applications that target the prediction of key parameters, such as crop yields, soil moisture content, weather conditions, and crop growth conditions; the detection of diseases, pests, and weed; and the identification of leaf or plant species [152]. Computer vision is an interdisciplinary field that has been gaining huge amounts of traction in recent years due to the surge in CNNs. It offers methods and techniques that allow the processing of digital images accurately and enables computers to interpret and understand the visual world [153]. A summary of agricultural applications using DL and computer vision techniques is given in Table 10. Among all the DL algorithms, CNNs or Convet and its variants are the most used algorithms in agricultural applications. The variants of CNN are region-based CNNs (RCNN), Fast-RCNN, Faster-RCNN, YOLO, and Mask-RCNN, among which the first four are mostly used to solve object detection problems. Mask-RCNN, on the other hand, is used to solve instance segmentation problems. The reader could refer to the existing bibliography for a detailed description of these algorithms and their applications [152]. Few studies have also used other DL techniques. Talking about datasets, most DL models are trained using images, and few models are trained using sensor data gathered from fields. This shows that DL can be applied to a wide variety of datasets. It is also observed that most of the work is done on outdoor farms, whereas next-generation farms (environment-controlled) are not extensively explored. Though DL has the potential to enable digital farming, most systems are still in the prototype phase. Additionally, the new challenges imposed by cyber-security and privacy issues require optimization of current DL and computer vision approaches.

Agricultural decision support systems A decision support system (DSS) can be defined as a smart system that supports decision-making to specific demands and problems by providing operational answers to stakeholders and potential users based on useful information extracted from raw data, documents, personal knowledge, and/or models [170]. DSS can be data-driven, model-driven, communication-driven, document-driven, and knowledge-driven. The salient features of these DSSs are available at following source [171]. Fig. 14 presents the general architecture of a DSS, consisting of four fundamental components, each having its specific purpose.

Due to the evolution of agriculture 4.0, the amount of farming data has increased immensely. To transfer this heterogenous data into practical knowledge, platforms like agricultural decision support systems (ADSS) are required to make evidence-based and precise decisions regarding farm operation and facility layout [172]. Over the past few years, ADSSs are gaining much attention in the agriculture sector. A number of ADSSs have been developed that focus on a variety of agricultural aspects, such as farm management, water management, and environmental management. Table 11 presents a summary of the ADSSs found in the literature. From this analysis, most ADSSs have been found to not consider expert knowledge, which is highly valuable as it allows to development of systems as per user's needs. The other reported issues with some of these ADDSs are complex GUIs, inadequate re-planning components, a lack of prediction and forecast abilities, and a lack of ability to adapt to uncertain and dynamic factors. It is also worth noting that all the ADSSs are for outdoor agricultural systems and are in the research phase. In comparison, the application of ADSS in indoor soilless farming is still very much unexploited. Table 11. Agricultural decision support systems.

Agricultural cyber-physical systems As one of the main technologies of Industry 4.0, a cyber-physical system (CPS) refers to an automated distributed system that integrates physical processes with communication networks and computing infrastructures [184]. There are three standard CPS reference architecture models: namely, 5C, RAMI 4.0, and IIRA, and their detailed description is available at following source [185]. Among these, the 5C is a well-known reference model with widespread usage. The architecture of 5C consists of five levels which are represented in Fig. 15. CPS benefits from a variety of existing technologies such as agent systems, IoT, CC, augmented reality, big data, and ML [186]. Its implementation ensures scalability, adaptability, autonomy, reliability, resilience, safety, and security improvements.

Agricultural field is regarded as one of the complex domains that can benefit from CPS technology. Agricultural cyber-physical systems (ACPSs) use advanced electronic technologies and agricultural facilities to build integrated farm management systems that interact with the physical environment to maintain an optimal growth environment for crops [188]. ACPSs collect the essential and appropriate data about climate, soil, and crops, with high accuracy and use it to manage watering, humidity, and plant health, etc. A variety of ACPSs has been developed for the management of different services, and their summary is given in Table 12. Looking at these ACPSs, most systems are still at the prototype and conceptual level. Moreover, most studies are conducted for outdoor farms, with only a few works published related to soil-based greenhouse systems. No study is found that is relevant to indoor soilless farming systems. ACPSs has attracted significant research interest because of their promising applications across different domains; deploying CPS models in real-life applications is still a challenge as it requires proper hardware and software [189]. Moreover, particular attention should be given to autonomy, robustness, and resilience while engineering ACPSs in order to handle the unpredictability of the environment and the uncertainty of the characteristics of agricultural facilities. There are multiple factors (humans, sensors, robots, crops, and data, among others) that impact ACPSs. To ensure a smooth operation while avoiding conflicts, errors, and disruptions, ACPSs need to be designed carefully and comprehensively. Table 12. Agricultural cyber-physical systems.

Digital twins in agriculture Digital twin (DT) is a dynamic virtual replica of a real-life (physical) object of which it mirrors its behaviors and states over multiple stages of object's lifecycle by using real-world data, simulation, and machine learning models, combined with data analytics to enable understanding, learning, and reasoning [198]. A complete description of the DT concept for any physical system requires consolidation and formalization of various characteristics, including the physical and virtual entities, the physical and virtual environments, the metrology, and realization modules that perform the physical to virtual and the virtual to physical connection or twinning, the twinning and twinning rate, and the physical and virtual processes [199]. The schematic showing the mapping of these characteristics is shown in Fig. 16. The DT concept has gained prominence due to the advances in the technologies such as the Internet of Things, big data, wireless sensor networks, and cloud computing. This is because these technologies allow real-time monitoring of physical twins at high spatial resolutions through both miniature devices and remote sensing that produce ever-increasing data streams [21]. The concept of DT in agricultural applications is rather immature as compared to other disciplines with its first references occurred in 2017; hence its added value has not yet been discussed extensively [21]. This is because framing is a highly complex and dynamic domain because of its dependence on natural conditions (climate, soil, humidity) and presence of living physical twins (plants and animals) and non-living physical twins (indoor farm buildings, grow beds, outdoor agricultural fields, agricultural machinery). The non-living physical twins interact directly or indirectly with plants and animals (living physical twins), thereby introducing more challenges for DT in agriculture. Whereas in other domains such as manufacturing DTs are mostly concerned with non-living physical twins. Table 13 summarises the agricultural DTs developed in the last 10 years. Table 13.

Trees planted on orchard IoT sensors, network, and computational units Prototype Open-air [207] The analysis shows that most studies have focused on open-air farming systems. Only one study is found that has proposed DT for soil-based vertical farming system and one study that implemented DT for soilless farming system (aquaponics). This might be because the design and management of modern farming systems are challenging. Moreover, most DTs are in the research phase with no commercial deployment at the moment. The reported benefits of the DT applications in agriculture are cost reductions, catastrophe prevention, clearer decision making, and efficient management operations, which can be applied to several agricultural subfields like plant and animal breeding, aquaponics, vertical farming, cropping systems, and livestock farming. While DT technology has great potential, achieving the synchronization between the physical entity and its digital counterpart is challenging. The complexity of this process is further amplified in agricultural systems due to the idiosyncrasies of living physical twins. Hence, implementation of agricultural DT should start with micro-farms, which can then be gradually enhanced to an intelligent and autonomous version by incorporating more components. 4.11. Roadblocks in digitization of agriculture industry This section provides an answer to RQ3 by listing a series of interconnected roadblocks hampering a larger adoption of digital technologies in the agriculture sector. After analysing 148 articles, 21 roadblocks are identified which can be categorized at technical and socio-economic levels. 4.12. Technical roadblocks • Interoperability: data is considered a cornerstone for the success of smart systems. Agricultural data usually comes from multiple heterogeneous sources such as thousands of individual farmlands, animal factories, and enterprise applications. This data can have diverse formats, making data integration complex. Hence, data interoperability is essential to enhance the value of this massively dispersed data after systematic data collection, storage, processing, and knowledge mining [208]. Likewise, for establishing effective communication between heterogeneous devices, they need to be interconnected and interoperable. With cross-technology communication, interoperability of the system can be improved [209]. • Standardization: to fully exploit the digital technologies for smart farming applications, standardization of the devices is essential. Output differences can occur because of misinterpretation and alterations from time to time. With standardization, the interoperability issues of the devices, applications, and systems can also be resolved [25]. • Dataquality: to produce meaningful results, data quality is also crucial along with data security, storage, and openness. The lack of decentralized data management systems is another roadblock hindering the adoption of smart farming practices [9]. This issue decreases the willingness of multiple actors to share agriculture data. • Hardwareimplementation: the deployment of a smart agricultural setup in large-scale open fields is extremely challenging. This is because all the hardware consisting of IoT devices, wireless sensor networks, sensor nodes, machinery, and equipment directly exposed to harsh environmental conditions such as heavy rainfall, high/low-temperature levels, extreme humidity, strong wind speeds and many other possible dangers which can destroy electronic circuits or disrupt their normal functionality [210]. A possible solution is to build an adequate casing for all the costly devices that is robust and durable enough to endure real field conditions [211]. • Adequatepower sources: typically, the wireless devices deployed at farms consistently operate for a long time and have limited battery life. A suitable energy saving scheme is necessary because, in case of any failure, instant battery replacement is complicated, especially in open-air farms where devices are strategically placed with minimum access [210]. The possible solutions to optimize energy consumption are usage of low power sensors and, proper management of communication [24,212]. Wireless power transfer and self-supporting wireless system are other promising solutions to eliminate the need for battery replacement by recharging the batteries through electromagnetic waves. However, long-distance wireless charging is needed in most agricultural applications [9]. Ambient energy harvesting from rivers, fluid flow, movement of vehicles and, ground surface using sensor nodes offers another viable solution, but the converted electrical energy is limited at present – posing the need to improve power conversion efficiency [213]. • Reliability: The reliability of devices, as well as corresponding software applications, is crucial. This is because IoT devices need to gather and transfer the data based on which decisions are made using several software packages. Unreliable sensing, processing, and transmission can cause false monitoring data reports, long delays, and even data loss – eventually impacting the performance of agricultural system [25]. • Adaptability: agricultural environments are complex, dynamic, and rapidly changing. Hence, when designing a system, it is pertinent for the devices and applications to proactively adapt with the other entities under uncertain and dynamic factors - offering the needed performance [214]. • Robust wirelessarchitectures: wireless networks and communication technologies offer several benefits in terms of low cost, wide-area coverage, adequate networking flexibility, and high scalability. But dynamic agriculture environments such as temperature variations, living objects’ movements, and the presence of obstacles pose severe challenges to reliable wireless communication. For instance, fluctuations in the signal intensity occur due to the multipath propagation effects – causing unstable connectivity and inadequate data transmission [215]. These factors impact the performance of the agricultural system. Hence, there is a need for robust and fault-tolerant wireless architectures with appropriate location of sensor nodes, antenna height, network topology, and communication protocols that also require minimum maintenance [11]. • Interference: another challenge is wireless interference and degradation of the quality of service because of the dense deployment of IoT devices and wireless sensor networks. These issues can be mitigated with efficient channel scheduling between heterogeneous sensing devices, cognitive radio-assisted WSNs, and emerging networking primitives such as concurrent transmission [216]. Since agriculture devices are distributed at indoor greenhouses, outdoor farmlands, underground areas, or even water areas, cross-media communication between underground, underwater, and air is also required for the complete incorporation of smart technologies [217]. • Security and privacy: the distributed nature of smart agricultural systems brings potential vulnerabilities to cyber-attacks such as eavesdropping, data integrity, denial-of-service attacks, or other types of disruptions that may risk privacy, integrity, and availability of the system [218]. Cyber-security is a major challenge that needs to be addressed within the context of smart farming, with diverse privacy-preserving mechanisms and federated learning approaches [130]. • Compatibility: to achieve the standards of fragmentation and scalability, the models or software applications developed should be flexible and run on any machine installed in the agricultural system [13]. • Resource optimization: farmers require a resource optimization process to estimate the optimal number of IoT devices and gateways, cloud storage size, and amount of transmitted data to improve farm profitability. Since farms have different sizes and need distinct types of sensors to measure different variables, resource optimization is challenging [219]. Secondly, most of the farm management systems do not offer run-time customization in relation to the distinct requirements of farmers. Hence, complex mathematical models and algorithms are required to estimate adequate resource allocation [75]. • Scalability: the number of devices, machinery, and sensors installed at farms is increasing gradually due to advancements in technologies. To support these entities, gateways, network applications, and back-end databases should be reliable and scalable [220]. • Human-centereduserinterfaces: complex user interfaces of existing agricultural applications and devices are impeding smart farming practices. Most GUI is designed in a way that only experts can use to perform agricultural tasks. Improving the user interface by making it human-centered with multimodal feedback will allow a larger group of people to use it to perform different agricultural operations [96]. 4.13. Socio-economic roadblocks • Gap between farmers and researchers: the participation of farmers is a key factor toward the success of the digitization of the agricultural industry. Farmers face a lot of problems during the agri-food production process, which smart technologies could fix, but agricultural experts are not usually aware of these issues [16]. Moreover, to devise an adequate smart solution, first, it is important to fully understand the nature of problems. Hence, it is essential to bridge the gap between farmers, agricultural professionals, and AI researchers. • Costs associated with smart systems: the costs associated with the adoption of smart technologies and systems are the major deterrent in the digitization of the agricultural sector. These costs usually involve deployment, operating, and maintenance costs. The deployment costs of smart systems are usually very high as they involve; i) hardware installation such as autonomous robots and drones, WSNs, gateways, and base station infrastructure, etc., to perform certain farm operations, and ii) hiring the skilled labour [221]. Likewise, to facilitate data processing, management of IoT devices and equipment, and knowledge exchange, subscription of centralized networks and software packages is required, which ultimately increases the operating costs [222]. Though sometimes service providers offer free subscription packages with restricted features, the amount of storage capacity is limited. To ensure the adequate operations of the smart system, occasional maintenance is required, which then also adds up to total costs. Other types of costs associated with smart systems deployment could be environmental, ethical, and social costs. To overcome cost related roadblocks, initiatives focusing on cooperative farming are needed that provide; i) support services for better handling of costs and needed investments, and ii) hardware solutions to transform conventional equipment into smart farm-ready machinery to reduce high initial costs [222]. • Digital division: another factor that is slowing the digitization of the agricultural sector is the lack of knowledge of digital technologies and their applications. The majority of farmers have no idea about the significance of digital technologies, how to implement and use them, and which technology is suitable for their farm and meets their requirements [14]. Hence, it is essential to educate farmers about modern farming technologies and systems. Moreover, different strategies are needed to build tools using natural language that farmers with low education levels can easily understand [223]. • Return on investment: in agriculture, the profit margin is very important like other sectors. When it comes to the implementation of advanced technologies, farmers have concerns related to the time to recover the investment and to the difficulties in evaluating the advantages [12]. • Trust building: unlike in other disciplines, building trust regarding the effectiveness of smart technologies in agriculture is difficult because many decisions affect systems that involve living and non-living entities, and consequences can be hard to reverse [16]. Additionally, insufficient proof of the impact of digital tools on-farm productivity further intensifies the current challenges. • Laws and regulations: different regions and countries have different legal frameworks which impact the implementation of digital technologies in the agriculture sector, particularly in monitoring and agri-food supply [70]. Likewise, regulations related to resource allocation (spectrum for wireless devices), data privacy, and security also vary from one country to another [70]. • Connectivity infrastructure: most less-developed countries usually have insufficient connectivity infrastructure that limits access to advanced digital tools that would help to turn data from heterogenous sources into valuable and actionable insights [10]. 4.14. Discussion This section discusses the main conclusions of RQ1, RQ2, and RQ3. In addition, added value, considerations, and future directions are also presented to ensure higher accuracy and great advancements in agricultural industry. 4.15. RQ1, RQ2 and RQ3 The present study tried to articulate the emerging digital technologies being implemented in agricultural industry to anticipate the future trajectories of agriculture 4.0. By looking at Table 2, Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, Table 6, Table 7, Table 8, Table 9, Table 10, Table 11, Table 12, Table 13 in section 4, it can be seen some technologies such as big data and analytics, wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and digital twins are not significantly explored in agriculture. A reason for this gap could be that implementing advanced technologies with more complex operations can be expensive, at least in the early experimental phase of their adoption. Hence, the development of these technologies in agricultural industry should increase in the coming years. The results of SLR also show that IoT is significantly implemented in farms. This is due to the broad functionality of IoT such as in the monitoring, tracking and tracing, agriculture machinery, and precision agriculture [21]. It can be said that IoT is one of the main research objectives within the agriculture 4.0 approaches. Nevertheless, only few studies have considered data security and reliability, scalability, and interoperability while developing an intelligent agricultural system. The research findings also demonstrated that most use cases are still in the prototype phase. The possible reason could be because most agricultural operations have to do with living subjects, like animals and plants or perishable products, and developing systems is harder than non-living human-made systems. Another reason might be that agriculture is a slow adopter of technology because of transdisciplinary nature of this field, and hence to develop intelligent systems, the agricultural community must become familiar will all the digital technologies. Lastly, variations in plant/crops’ species, and growth conditions also make digitization of agricultural systems complex [188]. The SLR findings also show that most of the systems are developed for open-air soil-based farms contrary to indoor farms (soilless and soil-based). This is due to complex design and management of indoor farms particularly soilless farms where parameters and factors (pH, air temperature, humidity, etc.) to be controlled are diverse [5]. But with introduction of digital technologies and data-driven computer applications in indoor farms, a more robust control of the process can be achieved. Furthermore, it is also revealed from SLR that limited research is conducted in three (soil management, fruit detection and counting and crop quality management) out of nine different service categories mentioned in section 3. This corroborates that substantial research and development is needed in some areas to ensure successful digitization of agriculture industry in developed countries as well as in developing countries. The complexity of agriculture ecosystem presents a series of interconnected roadblocks that hinder the full integration of digital technologies for agriculture 4.0 realization. Hence, it is essential to identify potential roadblocks in order to come up with strategic solutions to overcome them. This study is an attempt to explore what these roadblocks are. Based on analysis, 21 roadblocks were identified and classified at technical and socio-economic levels. These roadblocks are listed in section 5, which suggests what needs to be done for digitization of agricultural industry on larger scale. But it is still not known, to what extent elimination or mitigation of these roadblocks assist in successful integration of digital technologies. 4.16. Added value of agricultural digitization Based on analysis, several benefits that can motivate framers and other actors to support digitization of agricultural industry are identified and summarised below. The presented benefits have potential to maximise the farm's productivity and enhance product quality, but they should not be considered a panacea for challenges associated with smart agriculture [222]. • Improved agility: digital technologies improve the agility of farm operations. Through real-time surveillance and forecast systems, farmers or agricultural experts can rapidly react to any potential fluctuations in environmental and water conditions to save crops [221]. • Green process: digital technologies make the farming process more environmentally friendly and climate-resilient by significantly reducing the usage of in-field fuel, nitrogen fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides [224]. • Resource use efficiency: digital platforms can improve resource use efficiency by enhancing the quantity and quality of agricultural output and limiting the usage of water, energy, fertilizers, and pesticides [3]. • Time and cost savings: digital technologies enable significant time and cost savings by automating different operations, such as harvesting, sowing, or irrigation, controlling the application of fertilizers or pesticides, and scheduling the irrigation [225]. • Asset management: digital technologies allow real-time surveillance of farm properties and equipment to prevent theft, expedite component replacement and perform routine maintenance [10]. • Product safety: digital technologies ensure adequate farm productivity and guarantee a safe and nutritious supply of agri-food products by preventing fraud related to adulteration, counterfeit, and artificial enhancement [218]. 4.17. Considerations and future prospects The upcoming initiatives would result in significant improvements in the agricultural sector. But in order to make things sustainable for small and medium-scale growers, roadblocks mentioned in section 5 need to be addressed first. Awareness campaigns highlighting the significance of smart agriculture at every level of the agricultural value chain and promoting innovative ways (such as gamification) to encourage stakeholders to take on an active role in the digital revolution can mitigate some of the mentioned roadblocks [9]. Government level initiatives, grants and endowments, public-private partnerships, the openness of data, and regional basis research work can also assist in coping with potential roadblocks. Lastly, a roadmap can be adopted while developing a smart agriculture system, starting from basic architecture with few components and simpler functionality, gradually adding components and functionality to develop a complex system with the full potential of digitization [21]. These considerations can pave the way for successful implementation of agriculture 4.0. The future prospects of digital technologies in smart agriculture involve using explainable artificial intelligence to monitor crop growth, estimate crop biomass, evaluate crop health, and control pests and diseases. Explainable AI fades away the traditional black-box concept of machine learning and enables understanding the reasons behind any specific decision [15]. Description of big data through common semantics and ontologies and the adoption of open standards have great potential to boost research and development towards smart farming . Similarly, to ensure enhanced connectivity and live streaming of crop data, 5G technology need to be extensively explored [6]. 5G technology will minimize internet costs and augment the overall user experience of farm management and food safety by performing accurate crop inspections remotely [226]. Furthermore, it will significantly bridge the gap between stakeholders by keeping them well informed on produce availability. Lastly, blockchain in combination with IoT and other technologies can be implemented to address the challenges related to data privacy and security [227]. 4.18. Transition to Agriculture 5.0 The industrial revolutions have always brought a breakthrough in the agricultural sector. As formally discussed in previous sections, agriculture 4.0 has great potential to counterbalance the growing food demands and prepare for future by reinforcing agricultural systems with WSN, IoT, AI, etc. While the realization of agriculture 4.0 is still underway, there is already a talk about agriculture 5.0. Agriculture 5.0 extends agriculture 4.0 with inclusion of industry 5.0 principles to produce healthy and affordable food while ensuring to prevent degradation of the ecosystems on which life depends [228]. The European Commission formally called for the Fifth Industrial Revolution (industry 5.0) in 2021 after observing that industry 4.0 focuses less on the original principles of social fairness and sustainability but more on digitalization and AI-driven technologies for increasing the efficiency and flexibility [229]. Industry 5.0 complements and extends industry 4.0 concept to recognize the human-centricity, sustainability, and resilience [230]. It involves refining the collaborative interactions between humans and machines, reducing environmental impact through circular economy, and developing high degree of robustness in systems to achieve optimal balance between efficiency and productivity. The enabling technologies of industry 5.0 are Cobots (collaborative robots), smart materials with embedded bio-inspired sensors, digital twins, AI, energy efficient and secure data management, renewable energy sources, etc [229].. In agriculture 5.0 settings, farm's production efficiency and crop quality can be enhanced by assigning repetitive and monotonous tasks to the machines and the tasks which need critical thinking to the humans. For this purpose, similar to manufacturing sector cyber physical cognitive systems (CPCS) that observe/study the environment and take actions accordingly should be developed for agricultural sector. This may include collaborative farm robots which will work in the fields and assist crop producers in tedious tasks such as seed sowing and harvesting etc. Likewise, digital twins in agriculture 5.0 can also offer significant value by identifying technical issues in agricultural systems and overcoming them at a faster speed, detecting crop diseases, and making crop yield predictions at a higher accuracy rate. This shows that agriculture 5.0 has potential to pave a way for climate smart, sustainable and resilient agriculture but as of now, it is in the developing phase. 5. Conclusions Increased concerns about global food security have accelerated the need for next-generation industrial farms and intensive production methods in agriculture. At the forefront of this modern agricultural era, digital technologies offered by Industry 4.0 initiative are suggesting a myriad of creative solutions. The scientific community and researchers integrate disruptive technologies in conventional agriculture systems to increase crop yields, minimize costs, reduce wastes, and maintain process inputs. An SLR discussing the prevailing state of these technologies in the agriculture sector is presented in this study. After applying SLR protocol, 148 articles were considered from the time frame of the year 2011 to 2021. Various research questions pertaining to i) current and continuing research trends, ii) functionality, maturity level, farm type and tools and techniques used, iii) primary roadblocks, and iv) added value of digital technologies; were put forward and answered. Several conclusions are drawn such as integration of big data and analytics, wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and digital twins in agriculture is only in its infancy, and most use cases are in the prototype phase. Likewise, 21 roadblocks are identified and classified at technical and socioeconomic levels. To ensure the digitization of agricultural industry, these roadblocks must be analyzed and overcome. The added value of digital technologies in agriculture industry are also identified and presented in the study. Overall, this study contributes to the research being carried around agriculture 4.0. The primary limitation of this review is twofold: firstly, only three online repositories are considered for literature search (Scopus, IEEE and Science Direct), and secondly additional keywords and synonyms might return more studies. In both scenarios, it is highly unlikely that the overall findings would change. For the future work, additional research databases and aspects can be considered to provide holistic overview of agricultural industry in terms of digitization. Moreover, studies targeting agriculture 5.0 in general will also be included.

Food security is an issue that arises as a result of the rising population since population growth decreases 
agricultural land, leading to water scarcity. Agriculture requires large amounts of water, but water scarcity forces 
farmers to irrigate their crops with little or low-quality water, leading to the idea of developing smart irrigation. The 
challenge is how to manage the interactions between plants, growing media, microclimate, and water using 
manufactured systems. Good irrigation management will minimize the occurrence of poor irrigation design. This 
review is a way to present various methods and approaches for using sensors, controllers, the Internet of Things, 
and artificial intelligence in irrigation systems with a focus on improving water use efficiency. The study uses 
SCOPUS indexed publications and proceedings to study the evolution of irrigation information technology over the 
last eleven years. We hope this review can serve as a source of information to broaden the validity of the findings 
of irrigation monitoring and control technologies and help researchers identify future research directions on this 
subject.

INTRODUCTION 
Due to rising food demand and a growing human population, agriculture is the primary food supplier and the most 
prominent labor user. It is also one of the essential areas in a country's economy, according to gross domestic 
product (GDP) [1], [2]. Water availability is an essential factor in optimizing the growth of crops so that water 
scarcity can threaten food security. This reason makes water conservation an essential factor in overcoming water 
shortages while increasing yields. [3, 4]. Moreover, the development of agricultural technology and more efficient 
agricultural management can produce productive crops and quality harvests through greenhouse technology. 
Developing greenhouses for agriculture can increase crop yields and improve water use efficiency [5].  
Around 3.5% of the world's agricultural land uses greenhouse and hydroponic systems to conserve water use and 
other benefits such as crop protection and quality yields. A greenhouse is a building with a wooden or metal 
foundation covered with nets or transparent material. Since 1960 the greenhouse has evolved from a building that 
only protects plants into a system for studying plant growth in a controlled environment [6, 7]. Changes in 
agricultural land usage, lower irrigation water output in primary, secondary, and tertiary canals, and global 
microclimate changes contribute to the rising use of greenhouses in world agriculture [8].  
Agricultural ecosystems (soil, nutrients, temperature, humidity, sunlight, wind, and air composition) can be adapted 
to the needs of the plants planted in greenhouses to extend productive plant life, change planting seasons, 
increase crop yields and improve harvest quality. [9, 10]. Moving crops from their natural environment to 
greenhouses protect plants from weather and microclimate uncertainties. On the downside, a greenhouse is a 
place that can store solar heat and requires resources to manage the microclimate according to plant needs, 
especially in countries with tropical climates. [4, 11]. Crop growth problems arise in agriculture that depends on rain 
and drought; runoff and erosion problems also arise during heavy rains. Water control is needed to meet crop 
water needs while conserving water [12]. The water control system functioned as a regulator for water flow 
according to the plant's needs in its growth phase [13, 14]. 
Conventional irrigation systems use a uniform amount of water to fields from one corner to another during their 
growth period regardless of the type of plant and its water needs. The result is water-wasting, where one side of 
the land has sufficient water, while the other can have excess or lack of water [15]. Therefore, a control system 
known as an intelligent irrigation system is needed to support plants' water needs while saving water. The way the 
system works, in general, is to adapt to the type of plant and then automatically calculate the water needs of the

plant and schedule water supply based on the plant growth phase [16]. Intelligent irrigation systems are suitable for 
use in a greenhouse because a greenhouse has an enclosed structure to reduce or eliminate parameters affecting 
plant growth, such as seasons, rainfall, climate change, plant pests and diseases, and environmental changes [17, 
18]. 
Intelligent irrigation systems are part of precision agriculture, also known as smart farming, which integrates 
information technology, communication technology, and control technology to automate various agricultural 
activities that humans initially did. With an intelligent irrigation system, the irrigation process can run optimally in 
managing water to meet the needs of plants [19]. Intelligent irrigation systems can manage water needs based on 
various parameters such as microclimate conditions, weather, sunlight, water quality such as acidity (pH), turbidity 
(TDS), and electrical conductivity (EC), along with plant growth phases through the Internet of Things (IoT) devices. 
An intelligent irrigation system can improve irrigation decisions to achieve water savings and increased yields [20–
22]. 
The intelligent irrigation system is one of the best systems in managing and saving water while maximizing 
harvests; water is distributed evenly to each plant according to its needs and minimizes wasted water [23]. This 
system can also mix nutrients and water and help deliver them directly to the root zone, ensuring it is always in 
optimal moist conditions, minimizing surface runoff, preventing root rot, and eliminating percolation. The advantage 
is increased crop productivity, and better harvest quality also ensures optimal water efficiency. Nevertheless, good 
integration between IoT devices, monitoring, control, and data acquisition can be done automatically with minimum 
intervention to get an optimal and efficient, intelligent irrigation system [24, 25]. 
In the intelligent irrigation system, the controller can process input data, present information, and manage irrigation 
based on greenhouse conditions, especially crop conditions to prevent water deficit. Nevertheless, in addition to 
system automation, it is necessary to present current and past system conditions to users, both plant responses to 
the system and vice versa. This method ensures that water management runs smoothly, and users can study 
historical data as a reference for the next planting period and ensure optimal farming [26–29]. This process 
requires real-time monitoring, sophisticated control systems, and precise instruments. The difference between a 
monitoring system and a control system is that the control system regulates the hardware according to conditional 
constraints. The control system manages the hardware and software by defining the output and input parameters 
precisely. The input is microclimate parameters, plant properties, weather conditions, water quality, and other 
sensors collect helpful information [30–33]. 
Many articles published on IoT focus on agriculture, as discussed by [30, 34]. IoT is one of the best inventions of 
the 21st century in agriculture. In addition, review articles  [21], [35] discuss IoT opportunities in agriculture or 
intelligent farming and how the connection between IoT, data mining, data science, and machine learning 
sustainability supports agriculture. [36] describes the automation model for monitoring and controlling the 
agricultural sector and predicting information based on past data. There are currently no review studies that explore 
the monitoring and control strategy of intelligent irrigation systems in greenhouses, necessitating the formation of 
intelligent irrigation system review articles that focus on integrating various monitoring and control materials. As a 
result, this study will cover intelligent irrigation system monitoring and control mechanisms and their relevance to 
greenhouses and irrigation. 
This study aims to classify the results of previous research, identify the results, and bridge them with future trends 
to identify future research. Chapter 2 discusses research methodology, and Chapter 3 discusses various irrigation 
methods used by intelligent irrigation systems. In contrast, Chapter 4 discusses monitoring and controlling 
strategies for IoT and then continues to Chapter 5, discussing the integration of artificial intelligence. The last 
chapter discusses future directions and trends in intelligent irrigation. 
2 REVIEW METHODOLOGY 
The methodology applied in selecting published literature with the theme of intelligent farming focuses on the topic 
of intelligent irrigation systems and their control systems by using an extensive search on several online libraries of 
multidisciplinary journals as Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, Springer, MDPI, and IOP, as well as online 
engineering libraries as Agricola and IEEE Xplore. This technique produces many research articles relevant to 
intelligent farming and irrigation systems and their relationship to monitoring and control. That is why it is essential 
to check the reputation of the publisher's journal before using the article through the SCOPUS and ScimagoJR 
websites. This review's selection of relevant articles emphasizes the latest journal articles in the last eleven years 
(2011 - 2021); it can be seen in Figure 1a that in 2020 there was a surge in articles discussing monitoring, control, 
and artificial intelligence in agriculture. Other conditions are that all articles must be published in SCOPUS indexed 
journals and conference proceedings. As shown in Figure 1b, which shows the percentage of articles indexed by 
SCOPUS with articles with Quartile 1 dominating research in this field means that the research is internationally 
recognized and has the best quality content. All articles used are smart farming, intelligent irrigation system, and 
precision agriculture. Articles are carefully selected by reading and summarizing them to ensure continuity of ideas.

3 TYPES OF IRRIGATION 
Plants need water at regular intervals to grow and develop; in agriculture, this watering technique is called 
irrigation. Irrigation has two methods, namely conventional and modern. Conventional agriculture usually uses rain 
and surface irrigation to irrigate its land [37, 38]. The problem is how to predict rain accurately, and surface 
irrigation does not continuously irrigate the entire land with a uniform discharge. Surface irrigation, classified as 
conventional irrigation, works by distributing water from springs or rivers to the ground surface following gravity; 
monitoring is done manually by looking at the water level without IoT and automation [37].  
Developing countries generally use surface irrigation, for example, Indonesia. It uses it to irrigate paddy fields by 
constructing furrows that connect water sources with rice fields and irrigate them. However, this method requires a 
level ground surface to ensure adequate water distribution [39]. On the other hand, surface irrigation results in high 
levels of water loss due to evaporation, uncontrolled water discharge, and percolation, which can reduce soil 
nutrient levels resulting in sub-optimal crop yields [37]. There are two commonly used surface irrigations: (1) 
Furrow irrigation is interpreted as water flowing through small furrows made on the land slope. Water enters the soil 
from the bottom and sides of the furrow and moves laterally and downwards to moisten the soil and simultaneously 
carry dissolved salts, fertilizers, and herbicides [40]. Good tillage with uniform slopes can give better results from 
this method. Furrow irrigation is suitable for various soils, slopes, and crops especially row crops. Crops that will be 
damaged if water covers the stems or crowns should use furrow irrigation [40, 41]. Furrow irrigation is also suitable 
for tree crops. In the early stages of tree planting, using one furrow beside the tree row may be sufficient, but as the 
tree grows, creating two or more new furrows is necessary to provide sufficient water [42]. (2) Flooding Irrigation is 
an irrigation method commonly used to provide water in lowland rice cultivation and generally, water carried out 
continuously. Flooding is carried out continuously at the same height throughout plant growth, starting from planting 
until several days before harvest [43]. The use of flooding irrigation depends on sufficient water to flood the land 
surface with 10 cm of water. The disadvantage is inhibiting plant growth and water wastage [44]. Because flooding 
irrigation uses water excessively, flooding irrigation evolved into intermittent irrigation by flooding and drying the 
land alternately from planting season until one week before the flowering. The water level is maintained at 3 to 5 
cm during flowering. Giving water this way can reduce water usage up to 30 percent without reducing crop yields 
[43–45] 
 Modern irrigation offers uniform discharge for each plant, including nutrients and saving water, mainly when 
planting is carried out in a greenhouse, making it easier to monitor water quantity and quality and regulate water 
supply schedules [46, 47]. The amount of water delivered is determined by the plant's demands, irrigation method, 
and type of growing medium. The choice of irrigation method influences the type of nutrients, the number of 
nutrients, the rate of infiltration, evaporation, water absorption, and drainage [12]. 
Modern irrigation uses less water and is more efficient than conventional irrigation, and this method saves more 
energy and water. It is an effective method for use in areas where water is scarce or has irregular rains. This 
method allows farmers to cultivate crops consistently, creating a reliable food supply [3, 11]. Modern irrigation relies 
on water from wells, lakes, and reservoirs stored in water tanks and then irrigates plants using gravity or water 
pumps [12]. The method of giving water is even more specific, such as spraying water through a sprinkler or 
dripping water through an emitter onto plants. [39] developed an automatic irrigation data communication system

through the General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) and Zigbee module and built a microprocessor-based gateway 
to better control water discharge with water efficiency than conventional irrigation systems, with the difference 
between conventional and modern irrigation can be seen in Figure 2. 
 
Fig 2. Types of irrigation 
3.1 
Sprinkler Irrigation 
Farmers use sprinkler irrigation to mimic precipitation patterns. They used small sprinkler nozzles connected to an 
extensive piping system to ensure comprehensive irrigation coverage and used pumps to spray high-pressure 
water onto the air [48]. The advantage of sprinkler is that it minimizes runoff, is suitable for all types of soil, and has 
a water-saving rate of between 30 - 50%. Sprinkles can be mixed with fertilizer solutions and used in close 
cropping and high plant population [28]. However, this method has high operating costs for cleaning sprinkler 
nozzles and maintaining high-pressure pumps and pipes. In addition, sprinkler irrigation is unsuitable for use in 
windy areas because wind gusts and evapotranspiration cause high water loss rates. Moreover, regular 
maintenance of the pipes and their connections to avoid leaks or clogs can reduce the water spray pressure, 
reducing water distribution to the plants [37, 48]. 
3.2 
Drip Irrigation 
In drip irrigation, the water source moistens the soil or planting media through the holes in the pipes and flows 
through a hose connected to the emitter with low pressure. The focus of water droplets is a small part of the soil or 
growing medium that covers the root zone by adjusting it to get water droplets [49]. Drip irrigation is the most 
efficient irrigation because it can distribute water and nutrients simultaneously to the root zone, which results in 
better nutrient uptake. Due to the circulation of water in the roots through the capillary principle, the pores of the 
soil or planting medium remain dry so that air circulation is maintained and soil moisture is at field capacity. 
Produces a root zone capable of breathing more intensely during its growth cycle [25, 37, 50]. 
Drip irrigation uses dripping water delivered at a rate of between 2 - 20 liters per hour. The application of this 
method is to place an emitter on each plant. It is suitable for use on vegetables and fruit, but farmers usually only 
consider high-value plants because the investment value is relatively high [37, 49]. This method supports various 
types of soil by adjusting the speed of water application. Hefty porous sandy soils need a fast drip-rate; conversely, 
clay soil needs a slow drip rate to avoid water logging and runoff [25, 37]. 
4 MONITORING AND CONTROLLING STRATEGIES 
A total of 30 papers were used to examine the irrigation system's monitoring and control method. These 
publications provide ways for regulating irrigation by employing sensors to measure changes in microclimate, water 
quality, and soil moisture values. The paper's distribution is represented in Figure 3 below. 
An effective and efficient monitoring system is needed to collect different plant growth parameters. Monitoring in an 
intelligent irrigation system involves collecting data representing the latest microclimate data and water and soil 
conditions around the irrigation area through a microcontroller connected to the IoT [51], shown in Figure 4. The 
development of real-time monitoring devices was made possible due to the rapid development of microcontrollers 
and sensors, low-cost hardware (Arduino UNO, ESP8266, Raspberry Pi), and fast internet, which enhanced the 
performance of monitoring and control systems [17, 52]. There are two types of internet connections: wired and 
wireless; Wired connections make the internet connection stable, but with fixed hardware location. Wireless 
connection makes flexible hardware placement but has signal interference [53].

All devices and sensors are connected directly to the server via a cabling system in a wired connection case. This 
system is only effective when a few parameters are measured and use a small greenhouse; it is crucial because 
the more connected devices, the more cables are used. So, the wired greenhouse system is not suitable for large 
or commercial greenhouses. The advantage is that data transactions are safe and have minimal interference [51, 
53, 54]. WSN is the latest technology in intelligent farming that can be expanded and scaled up without modifying 
the greenhouse infrastructure. Its wireless form makes it easy to receive and transmit data between nodes using 
low-power frequencies. Unfortunately, interference and signal loss are common problems because of the high 
frequency in the air. However, the increase in greenhouse size, the number of parameters, sensors variety, node 
size, and devices distant is not a problem because an additional WSN only needs to be attached to an existing 
network. Another advantage is Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) technology, wirelessly connected sensor nodes 
network to sense and send various data, and extensible [36, 54, 55]. 
The implementation of WSN in agriculture itself is extensive, with sensors, RFID, cameras, drones, and cloud 
services connected seamlessly for data acquisition and transmission. Cloud computing serves data collection and 
analysis to generate visualizations, decision support, and commands; system users (farmers or researchers) can 
then access data remotely via their devices to gain real-time insights [19, 56]. Thus, monitoring and controlling the 
intelligent irrigation system can be effective, efficient, convenient, and optimal yields. [55] proposed the approach 
with WSN and gateway node to collect soil moisture values in plants by taking soil and cultivated plants images. 
The challenges in building a system that can accommodate these two technologies are sensor coverage, 
communication between devices, computational process efficiency, and electricity usage. [57] also offers UAVs for 
aerial monitoring of vegetation and irrigation areas. 
Appropriate control techniques in intelligent irrigation systems can increase crop water supply precisely to improve 
the efficiency of water use, energy savings, harvest optimization, proper use of nutrients, and effective use of labor.

Therefore, a control system can manipulate several irrigation parameters, like air circulation, air temperature, 
relative humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation [58–60]. A technology that can analyze the surface temperature 
of agricultural land without touching it using thermal imaging was proposed by [61] to determine which areas of 
land are in dire need of water because the non-uniformity of soil moisture can inhibit spinach growth. Studies by 
[56, 62–64] also state that it is possible to use thermal imaging for nurseries, forecasting crop yields, pest and 
disease disturbances, maintenance of agricultural machinery, and irrigation scheduling. 
4.1 
Microclimate based  
Monitoring and controlling the microclimate in the greenhouse is a critical factor to account for water loss due to 
evaporation. Air temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, and wind speed need precision measurements to 
meet crop water requirements [30, 65]. The Raspberry Pi, various Arduino models, connected to WSN, and cloud 
servers are popular hardware. WSN implementation is an efficient way to interconnect various sensors placed far 
apart in the greenhouse. The system performs accurate system monitoring, collects data, and presents charts, and 
control devices are activated, referring to predefined threshold values compared with real-time data [30, 36, 66]. 
[59] presented a technique for evaluating microclimate parameters in two tropical greenhouses before planting 
tomatoes using LoRa wireless and IoT sensors. The comfort ratio model (CftM) and scenario analysis show that 
environmental conditions can adapt to the growth phase of tomato plants. The microclimate before and during 
planting was analyzed using the Simulink app. Also, a study by [67] showed that a microclimate parameter 
measurement device in a greenhouse could yield comprehensive data for temperature, humidity, CO2 levels, 
lighting levels, soil moisture, acidity, irrigation water conductivity, and airflow velocity. In winter, the greenhouse 
behavior was studied by [68] using fuzzy logic control (FLC) due to uncertainty in the greenhouse environment. The 
fuzzy set was developed based on experts in greenhouse thermal behavior. Fuzzy control manages decisions 
based on weather forecasts and user interactions. [54] also took a similar approach to measure leaf temperature, 
air temperature, and soil moisture using three connected sensors to assess the level of microclimate in a 
greenhouse and use Zigbee to transmit sensor data. 
Controlling the microclimate in the greenhouse by using fan ventilation and fan-pad ventilation can also be an 
option. This forced ventilation can prevent plants from overheating even if the greenhouse does not use an 
evaporative cooling system. Greenhouses can produce good harvests in the spring, and the data show a 
relationship between the greenhouse microclimate and water uptake that minimizes drainage [69]. [70] built a 
monitoring system using an open-source platform to collect microclimate variables (air temperature, humidity, soil 
temperature, and soil moisture). Communication between devices uses Bluetooth and obtain electricity supply 
through solar panels. [71] has proposed improvements to the greenhouse IoT-based system by adding color 
spectrum monitoring using a camera system to get photos of the plant canopies translated into color (RGB, HSL, 
and brightness), plant texture, thermal (plant temperature), and plant morphology. The system works with NFT to 
irrigate lettuce plants in the greenhouse, automatically recording data and identifying plant stress levels. 
4.2 
Water Quality-based 
Water quality safety is a challenge in the 21st century because of the many pollutants, which are predominantly 
artificial such as environmental damage, packaging waste, or chemical waste. Overexploitation of natural 
resources, rapid industrial development, and agricultural expansion are the leading causes of the problem. [72]. 
Water quality is affected by direct and indirect sources of pollution such as sewage, factory waste, agricultural and 
urban runoff. The need for human involvement in water quality management is essential [73, 74]. Water quality 
management is a way to regularly collect water quality information in a location to find out its current condition. 
Water quality management aims to measure water quality variables such as microbial content physical and 
chemical properties, provide an early warning system and provide decision support for further treatment [75, 76]. 
WSN and IoT are inevitable to manage variables over a wide area for larger areas such as lakes or oceans. 
[75] has proposed a system that assesses irrigation water quality with IoT by detecting potential hydrogen (pH), 
electrical conductivity (EC), turbidity, and salinity in real-time using different sensors to maintain plant health status. 
Also, [77] undertook a study to build a continuous water quality monitoring system using open-source hardware 
and low-cost sensors. Preliminary results show that the device can produce accurate results at a lower cost than 
existing technologies with proper calibration. 
4.3 
Soil Moisture-based 
Farmers need to consider soil conditions because moist soil means the plant still has enough water for growth [11]. 
Monitoring soil moisture content becomes vital as the basis for irrigation scheduling. Raspberry Pi and Arduino 
UNO have commonly used devices in developing low-cost IoT-based soil moisture management interfaced using 
various sensors [30, 60, 75]. The sensor used is a capacitive type and transmits electricity without conduction; it 
can measure soil moisture changes by planting them into the soil and measuring its volumetric water content. The 
Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) sensor is a more precise option for measuring soil moisture, consisting of two 
metal rods embedded at the depth at which the humidity is to be measured. Works by sending pulses to the soil 
and then calculating the response of the soil as soil moisture content. Due to its good quality in measuring soil 
moisture, this TDR sensor is quite expensive to use in large-scale greenhouses [78, 79].

[80] proposed a soil moisture control system for measuring water content in soil at different soil depths, soil types, 
and air temperatures using various sensors integrated with Arduino UNO. The ESP8266 wireless module is then 
linked to the Arduino to upload data to the cloud server. A similar study by [81] succeeded in developing an IoT-
based field control system integrated with cloud-based data monitoring and analysis. The analysis results help 
predict water consumption for better crop yields. [82] approach to controlling soil moisture uses wireless technology 
utilizing GSM networks and push notifications to automate water supply for plants. A system proposed by [83] 
presents an Android application-based humidity monitoring method, where an Arduino interface sensor connected 
to Wi-Fi sends state data to a smartphone. Another monitoring approach is carried out by [60] using IoT and soil 
nutrient sensors to detect nutrient adequacy for plants. The decision support system then receives the data 
parameters and processes them as a farming decision. 
[84] implemented a user-friendly system, representing the soil moisture level with colors. These colors have helped 
farmers visually identify and manage soil moisture content without understanding the values displayed. Likewise, 
[85] proposed a soil nutrient control system that can manage the concentration of nutrients in the soil by planting 
sensors in the soil to map nutrient variability. Also, [86] developed an innovative device that uses a camera-
integrated drone for field mapping. Images are analyzed to generate soil moisture and nutrient values and use 
them for irrigation planning and scheduling. 
5 ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN IRRIGATION SYSTEM 
Artificial intelligence in intelligent irrigation systems was the subject of 25 papers. These studies concentrate on 
developing decision support systems, fuzzy logic models, and artificial neural network models that can take 
decisions automatically in response to changes in field conditions. The distribution of articles based on the theme 
of artificial intelligence is shown in Figure 5 below. 
 
Fig 5. Distribution of papers on artificial intelligence in irrigation system 
Artificial intelligence (AI) is a branch of science concerned with creating machines that can understand and act in 
the same way as humans. Machine learning is a burgeoning sub-domain of AI that explores patterns in large 
amounts of data [58, 87]. The popularity of machine learning is due to more and more data generated by various 
applications and IoT. The system can generate helpful information for making decisions or becoming input to other 
systems by studying data patterns. The need for agricultural products is directly proportional to the increase in the 
earth's population, so agroindustry and innovative agriculture technology get the spotlight in the industrial revolution 
4.0 [16, 46].  
AI has the potential to solve nonlinear, multiparameter, and time-varying problems in managing intelligent irrigation 
systems. By applying AI algorithms to specific problem areas, the system tries to imitate human logic, thought 
processes, and decision making through the application of Fuzzy Logic, Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest 
Neighbor (kNN), Decision Tree and Random Forest by using past data to feed AI and provides new knowledge to 
the system [58, 61]. [88] has researched by applying different regression and machine learning algorithms to 
several sensor datasets to develop weekly irrigation plan predictions. 
A study implementing an intelligent irrigation system shows many advantages, such as minimizing soil stress to 
changing microclimate conditions, efficient water use, and reducing human interaction. This solar panel-powered 
system has a Sensor Layer, Central Layer, and Valve Layer running together. The function of the Central Layer is 
to control the process that produces input (sensor layer detects moisture content) and output (valve layer opens to 
provide water). The system also enables fertilizers and pesticides by calibrating other sensors according to the 
required input [89].

make irrigation management decisions; this is where the decision support system (DSS) comes in [76, 90]. DSS 
has a framework that can represent complex systems with an efficient and robust approach that is easy to 
understand generates additional information and new perspectives to improve the quality of irrigation management. 
DSS is an information system that analyzes data and represents it to make decisions quickly. The primary purpose 
of DSS is to support and improve decision-making [28, 76]. Figure 6 shows a DSS logic diagram that consists of 
four connected components: Database, model base, knowledge base, and user interface. 
 
Fig 6. Block diagram of Decision Support System 
The Database in irrigation DSS collects and manages air temperature, relative humidity, crop water requirements, 
irrigation records, and solar radiation. The knowledge base has three parts: fact base, rule base, and inference 
engine used to analyze data, solve uncertain problems and draw conclusions. The model base creates optimization 
models, integrates numerous decision models, analyzes them to create crop water simulations, and offers farmers 
irrigation scheduling. [71, 76]. 
Developing and utilizing a decision support system in irrigation management is essential for scheduling water 
delivery based on crop needs. The main problem is how moist the soil is and how much water the plants need 
based on the type of plant, planting technique, availability of water, amount of fertilizer applied, microclimate 
conditions, and stage of plant development [91]. With DSS, farmers can manage their farms daily using plant 
databases and water supply strategies to perform irrigation calculations and fertilization adjustments to obtain 
optimal yields. There are times when a system has a crop suggestion feature that advises farmers to plant a crop 
that yields the highest profit under certain constraints [92]. 
The problem is that the characteristics of crops, soils, and microclimatic conditions in agriculture are dynamic and 
not linear, varying with seasons. Therefore, setting the proper irrigation schedule will directly influence plant growth. 
The core of DSS includes monitoring different parameters using different sensors and configuring their rules. DSS 
manages sensor readings stored in the cloud to adjust irrigation scheduling to maintain irrigation system efficiency 
routinely [76, 90]. An intelligent irrigation DSS must have the ability to adapt to changes in transient and spatial 
plant dynamics, such as uncertainties in microclimate conditions, nutrient requirements, and environmental 
changes. Researchers have proposed many studies on DSS applied to irrigation systems, such as [93], who 
developed an automated irrigation system using a single lateral pipe covering a large area to manage water at 
varying speeds. 
Sprinkler irrigation developed by [94] uses an automatic linear moving sprinkler system with WSN based DSS. The 
system can adapt to crop types, irrigation requirements, and planting locations to command individual sprinkler 
heads how and where water must be applied. Similarly, [76] built a DSS integrated fertigation simulator for 
designing drip or sprinkler irrigation for on-site olives and grapes farms. The system has a database, simulation 
model, and user interface that shows the ranking of design alternatives through multicriteria decision-making 
(MCDM). The scope of the calculation of this system includes land analysis, water requirements, and plant 
nutrition.

5.2 
Fuzzy Logic Model 
A fuzzy logic model is a data-driven technique with easy-to-understand logical rules. [50, 68, 95] proposed a fuzzy 
logic-based irrigation scheduling by enforcing control rules to microclimate data, evaporation data, and soil 
conditions. The process flow can be seen in Figure 7. 
[96] succeeded in building and testing a rule-based Fuzzy Logic application to assess the water stress index of 
plants in a greenhouse; the application accepts three input variables, namely air temperature, solar radiation, and 
water pressure. Results show that Fuzzy Logic eliminates the need for air aerodynamic resistance data, making 
this system more straightforward. 
[95] developed fuzzy logic using the LabVIEW application to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for a drip 
irrigation control system in a greenhouse. The input parameters used are air temperature and soil moisture and 
process them using fuzzy rules to produce information of irrigation duration. The test results show that fuzzy logic 
control can efficiently estimate irrigation schedules in an automated system, and greenhouse managers can 
monitor real-time data and devices that are easy to manage, even for ordinary users. [97] research also designed 
an irrigation control based on fuzzy logic applying the Penman-Monteith equation for rice cultivation with a 
parameter model in the difference between actual and target evapotranspiration following the plant growth phase. 
Each phase has its water requirement. The research aims to develop an intelligent system that helps irrigation 
management and produces a system that can work better than conventional irrigation systems. The results showed 
that the control system saves water, improves irrigation performance, improves crop quality, and saves labor.  
 
Fig 7. Fuzzy Logic-based Intelligent Irrigation System 
Also, [50] developed a fuzzy logic system that evaluates the irrigation system based on the variable availability of 
irrigation water during the planting period on the level of farmers' income which results in the efficiency of the 
irrigation system performance. To assist in making decisions on irrigation distribution. [98] conducted similar 
research by developing an intelligent irrigation system to turn on and off the irrigation system using input 
parameters of water use, water and air temperature, and soil moisture. They implement WSN-based monitoring to 
send data on fuzzy logic, which then performs irrigation scheduling by applying fuzzy rules. The system can 
maintain soil moisture content at the specified limit to save the use of electrical energy, water, and runoff. 
5.3 
Artificial Neural Network Model 
One application of AI in agriculture is Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) algorithms, which can predict using elements 
interconnected and work in parallel. The advantage of neural networks is that they can be trained, for example, to 
distinguish grass from rice or to compare tomatoes to peppers [71]. The ANN system can predict with high 
accuracy when fed reliable and precise data. A trained ANN is considered an expert in a category of data. This 
expert can then predict possible future conditions and prepare what-if scenarios [73, 87]. Other advantages of ANN 
are (1) Adaptive learning, the ability to learn and carry out tasks based on the data provided, (2) Self-organization, 
the system can independently compile and build information representations during the learning process, and (3) 
Real-time operations, computations are carried out in parallel, so it is faster to get calculation results [99]. 
The ANN model is a simple model consisting of three primary neurons distributed in the input layer, multiples of the 
hidden layer, and the output layer. ANN development requires necessary basic steps, namely datasets, ANN 
model training data, and ANN model test data for evaluation. Using quality data, the ANN model has a mechanism 
for self-study and solving complex problems. Input neurons receive parameters, then hidden neurons perform 
665

computations, and output neurons send signals to other network layers; and interconnect neurons using linear and 
nonlinear functions [26, 87, 99, 100]. 
The following Figure 8 shows the ANN process flow. In general, the use of ANN includes problem-solving in system 
optimization, process control, pattern classification, forecasting, and prediction. The main components of an ANN 
model consist of neuron nodes, a hidden layer containing weights between parameters and distribution rules to 
generate information for learning rules and independent learning skills through experience. There are two types of 
ANN models based on their input choices: feed-forward and feed-backward networks [99]. 
 
Fig 8. The flow of feed-forward artificial neurons 
Evapotranspiration is essential information that needs to be known to optimize plant growth, especially in water 
management and sustainable irrigation systems. Knowledge of the parameters of air temperature, relative 
humidity, wind speed, hours of sunshine, and latitude can optimize the management of ET0 in a greenhouse [97]. 
ANN research on intelligent irrigation systems is applied to scheduling and irrigation discharge to achieve savings 
in irrigation water use. [87] conducted a study to estimate the value of soil moisture in rice farming land using 
minimal micro and macro climate data by applying two ANN models. The first model predicts the value of ET0 
using the minimum, maximum and average air temperature variables. The second model does the same thing but 
uses air temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation. The test results show that both models produce reliable and 
accurate soil moisture estimates. 
A study by [101] has developed an ANN model to calculate evapotranspiration (ET0). After testing, they concluded 
that the ANN model predicts evapotranspiration better than the conventional ET0 equation. Similarly, [90] 
developed an ANN to calculate ET0 and compared it with the Penman-FAO equation and Penman-Monteith model 
using four and six microclimate variables as inputs. The test indicates that the three models provide accurate 
results using six input parameters. In contrast, the test results with four parameters show that only the ANN model 
can accurately predict the ET0 value. This research shows that building an ANN model is possible even with limited 
microclimate data.  
In addition, irrigation control system automation was also proposed by [102] using the ANN cluster and closed-loop 
control, which resulted in better performance than time-based irrigation control. However, they did not provide 
information regarding the irrigation method used and the percentage of water savings. [100] developed an 
intelligent irrigation system for evapotranspiration using the ANN model and a photovoltaic system to predict 
irrigation scheduling based on cropping moisture distribution data; this study reported better daily water and 
electrical energy savings also better crop yields. The application of ANN in irrigation water management has also 
discussed prediction of water salinity, water quality, rain runoff, and forecasting of surface irrigation infiltration,  
[73] proposed two ANN models to predict Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) and Dissolved Oxygen (DO) for 
irrigation water originating from rivers; the conclusion is that water quality management in other areas can also use 
this ANN model. Similarly, [103] uses the ANN model to design an intelligent system to manage water systems for 
agriculture and fisheries. [104] explained that the greenhouse environment has dynamic and complex 
characteristics, making it difficult to use conventional control methods as a solution. Radial Basis Function Neural 
Networks (RBF) algorithm and nonlinear adaptive controllers become solutions to control greenhouse microclimate. 
[74] discusses the use of ANN in drip irrigation systems to predict the distribution of subsurface irrigation water. 
The development of the ANN is to model the continuous wetting pattern after the water droplets from the emitter 
touch the ground surface. 
6 FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES 
This review explored the various studies and progress to improve irrigation water use efficiency, nutrient 
optimization, and crop yields. The aim is to improve and increase food availability by implementing IoT-based 
monitoring and control on agricultural land, especially greenhouses. The review results show that researchers and

farmers can maximize the use of the latest IoT technologies for environmental conditions monitoring, data-driven 
control, and artificial intelligence. Nowadays, there is an increase in research that develops techniques and models 
for developing irrigation control systems. The trend is due to the emergence of various sensors and controls on the 
market; this provides vast opportunities for the development of precision agriculture, especially for making 
intelligent predictions of agricultural processes such as crop yields, crop water requirements, and microclimate 
conditions. Researchers also need to explore other factors that influence irrigation scheduling planning, especially 
in large agricultural areas, because researchers generally conduct studies on a laboratory scale. Research from 
different perspectives will enrich intelligent irrigation systems and result in inaccurate predictions that can advise 
farmers regarding their farming activities and notify them when anomalies occur. 
Furthermore, researchers need to test various control systems in the irrigation systems discussed, focus on 
adaptive control, and combine it with real-time monitoring. It is essential to build systems that can adapt to dynamic 
parameters of microclimate, soil, and plant. At the same time, ensure the intelligent irrigation system runs optimally. 
In addition, it is essential to develop intelligent irrigation systems that are increasingly complex and digital-based so 
that the technology is suitable, affordable, and stable for smallholders. The hope is to increase water use efficiency 
and solve water scarcity. 
7 CONCLUSION 
Limited water has become the biggest challenge for farmers, and efficiency must solve water scarcity in irrigation 
management. The main objective is to control the amount and frequency of irrigation so that the amount of water 
received by plants is sufficient to keep the root zone moist. Farmers who are generally ignorant about the 
complexity of optimal irrigation management need a system that can facilitate big data processing analysis tools 
and transmit quality information quickly and efficiently. The system must be able to provide recommendations 
according to the conditions of the agricultural environment to increase the experience and decision-making of 
farmers. 
This problem challenges researchers to increase efforts to develop sophisticated monitoring and control strategies 
for intelligent farming that minimize irrigation water use. This review draws on previous relevant studies on 
agriculture water saving. The review results describe research trends in intelligent irrigation systems monitoring 
and control strategies and assess research opportunities to ensure water availability and savings. We hope this 
review provides insight and inspiration for researchers to continue research on irrigation monitoring and control to 
achieve food security and water savings.

Abstract— Sustainability is a normative concept, building on 
ideas such as justice, equity and responsibility, and based on 
human culture and society. Computers, internet, and the 
technologies that are central in our network society embed also 
normative values and are part of a cultural context. But the work 
looking at computer technologies and sustainability has been 
mostly oriented towards either calculating the impact of 
technology or using technology as a tool for solving practical 
problems. ICT is seen as a neutral system to be used or study, 
while the more normative aspects are mostly overlooked. This 
paper explores some of the problems arising from these 
overlooked normative values, such as focusing only on 
quantifiable problems while forgetting other aspects that may be 
as important but not easy to put in numbers, or trusting too 
much in numbers while hiding assumption and model choices. 
This paper suggests that more critical reflection on these 
questions is needed in the research area, as well as developing 
more connections with existing research on these topics in more 
traditional disciplines.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Sustainability is a normative concept, building on ideas 
such as justice, equity and responsibility, and based on human 
culture and society. The most cited definition comes from the 
Brundtland's report for the UN World Commission on 
Environment and Development: “development that meets the 
needs of the present without compromising the ability of future 
generations to meet their needs” [1]. The key point in this 
definition is bringing together environmental and humanitarian 
concerns under the concept of equity (between and within 
generations). It includes the concept of needs and human 
wellbeing, in particular focusing on the world's poor, and the 
idea of limits on the environment ability to meet these needs. It 
frames the environmental problems not as something external 
to human society, but as a basis for our future. It includes the 
realization that the social and economic systems are not 
independent of the environment, but embedded in it, and that 
these systems have to take into account that we live on a 
limited planet. Sustainability is different than most other topics 
in science and engineering and can be defined as a “wicked 
problem” [2]. Wicked problems are problems that contain 
paradoxes, 
conflicts, 
changing 
requirement, 
complex 
interdependencies and that cannot be easily modeled by 
traditional scientific approaches [3]. Sustainability research and 
practice makes extensive use of modeling tools and quantitative 
techniques such as life cycle assessment (LCA) [4] that may 
seem less normative, but that embed also political ideological 
and ethical values [5].  
ICT for sustainability (ICT4S) is a growing research area 
exploring the use of information technologies with a 
sustainability purpose [6]. Most ICT4S research has focused 
either on understanding the negative direct impacts of hardware 
such as energy use of internet [7,8,9] and the generation of e-
waste [10], or on the applications of using the technologies 
with a sustainability purpose, such as increasing the efficiency 
of systems and increasing dematerialization [11] or triggering 
behavioral change [12]. Computer technologies are treated 
either as a system to be understood, or as tools that can be used 
for some purpose. This paper argues that this focus on 
computers as tools, without reflecting upon the bias coming 
from their cultural context and history, creates problems and 
blindspots that are worth bringing attention to. First the paper 
presents the focus on quantitative data, central to the 
affordances provided by computer technologies, as a key 
component of ICT4S. Second, it discusses new characteristics 
and approaches that ICT is adding to how we work with 
sustainability work. Based on these, this paper explores some 
of the risks and blindspots of the focus on metrics and 
quantitative data in the context of a wicked normative problem 
such as sustainability. Finally, some proposals for contributions 
and further research in this topic are proposed. 
II. IT’S ALL ABOUT THE DATA 
It can be argued that the applications and research in the 
area of ICT for Sustainability are for the most part based on the 
creation, processing and communication of quantitative 
sustainability data [13]. This is not unexpected, as logic and 
arithmetic calculations are historically main tasks computers 
were created for. This text presents efficiency and behavioral 
change as two main topics of ICT4S that represent this focus 
on quantitative data. Efficiency is one of the key concepts that 
are heavily mentioned in the literature of ICT for Sustainability 
[14]. Reports such as Smart2020 [11], and Greener and Smarter 
[15], point out efficiency as the most important contribution 
that ICT can make to sustainability, and even as a central part

in achieving a more sustainable society in general. In the 
context of ICT4S, efficiency usually means the use of ICT for 
optimizing a system or a process with a sustainability purpose, 
for instance reducing the amount of energy and materials 
required for delivering a service or the greenhouse gases 
produced when creating a product. ICT has always been used 
to increase efficiency, specially time-efficiency, accelerating 
existing processes [16]. This acceleration is the defining 
characteristic of the impact of ICT in society, and as Castells 
[17] argues, one of the pillars of the information society. The 
current discourse in ICT4S uses the terms smart or smarter, 
arguing that by measuring and controlling parameters, ICT can 
tune and automate existing systems, reducing emissions and 
resource consumption while maintaining or increasing utility. 
Examples of this include the topics of smart cities, smart grids, 
smart appliances, intelligent transport systems and smart 
logistics. Smart grid is representative for how ICT is being 
applied for sustainability related efficiency. Information 
technologies are used to improve the actual electricity grid 
system, for instance routing power more efficiently, reducing 
the need for excess capacity and allowing two-way real time 
information exchange between producers and customers for 
real time demand side management. Smart grid has been 
suggested as the single most important application of ICT for 
reducing greenhouse gas emissions  [11]. Intelligent transport 
systems (ITS) is also a very active research area where the 
optimization potential of ICT is being explored, including the 
optimization of storage and transportation of goods [11]. ICT 
applications that are suggested to increase efficiency include 
inventory reduction, eco-driving, route optimization and 
intermodal shifts. A particular example is the computer models 
used by Japan National Institute of Informatics for calculating 
the best possible delivery route between different stores and 
providers, creating both economical and environmental savings 
[18]. Efficiency measures are also being applied to other fields, 
such as agriculture. For instance ICT based smart irrigation 
systems to reduce water usage and carbon emissions by 
context-aware watering schedules, using weather data and/or 
soil moisture and evapotranspiration sensing [19]. 
Another central theme of ICT for sustainability is the use of 
technology for supporting or triggering behavioral change 
towards sustainability. This includes research on eco-feedback, 
persuasive technologies, ambient awareness and pervasive and 
participatory sensing. This kind of research is most prominent 
in the area of Sustainable HCI. Di Salvo et al [12] in their 
survey of the research area found that 70% of the publication 
corpus on sustainable HCI was on persuasive and ambient 
awareness. A main concept in research about behavioral 
change is using technology for “making the invisible visible”. 
Information technology is used to visualize and communicate 
data that is relevant for sustainability such as energy use, water 
use or carbon dioxide emissions [20]. This is seen as a 
precondition for acting and increasing sustainability: if it's 
visible, it's actionable and then it can be made sustainable [21]. 
Some examples of applications and research looking at these 
topics include: research on energy meters for visualizing 
energy consumption at home; the use of competition and other 
persuasive techniques for reducing energy consumption; 
projects making energy visible, such as transparent screens 
showing a metaphorical tree representing energy consumption, 
power cords that make electricity consumption visible, and 
lamps that reward low energy use [22,23]; visualization of 
water usage at home using a LED lights  display in the shower 
[24]; visualization of carbon dioxide impact in the supply chain 
of products [25]. 
Many efficiency and behavioral change applications are 
based on the gathering, processing and visualization of metrics. 
Efficiency and smart solutions use ICT for gathering 
information, processing it and analyzing more optimal 
solutions, automating processes based on the data, and getting 
feedback from the changes. Behavioral change applications are 
in many cases (not all) based on providing quantitative 
feedback (either directly or in some persuasive way such as in 
games) to the users to help them make better decisions and 
increase their awareness about the impact of their actions. 
Using ICT for efficiency and behavioral change provides 
opportunities and solutions that can have a positive impact in 
sustainability. It could even be said that they are necessary. It is 
difficult to change something if there is no feedback of the 
starting state and of how the actions performed affect it. But the 
implicit emphasis on “what can be measured” creates problems 
and blindspots that are worth discussing, both for minimizing 
the risks and for opening up new opportunities that may be 
hidden. 
III. NEW DATA APPROACHES 
The use of new information technologies in quantitative data 
also adds special characteristics that differ from the way 
“traditional” methods in sustainability information, in 
practices such as LCA and environmental impact analysis. 
These characteristics show how the application of new 
technologies and approaches from ICT can transform (and is 
already transforming) how data is created, shared and 
visualized in sustainability practice [13,26,27]: 
A. Bottom up automatic data 
The use of new technologies such as pervasive sensing, 
machine-readable data, and open licenses, together with new 
approaches such as crowdsourcing and mashups, are changing 
how data is created and collected. These approaches can 
change how sustainability data is created, from a mostly 
manual way to a more automated and bottom-up approach, 
where bigger amounts of data can be processed in a more 
programmatic style. With the exponential increase on the 
world's capacity to store, communicate and compute 
information and the increase of data availability connected to 
the physical world, the same approach could be applied to 
other products and services.  
Crowdsourcing is also relevant in this context, as it changes 
the way data can be collected to a more social bottom-up 
approach. Relevant examples using crowdsourcing in a 
sustainability context include the gathering of weather data 
149
[28], the track of deforestation using satellite pictures1, or 
information about supply chains [25]. Pervasive sensing is 
another technology that can enable the automatic gathering of 
data. Examples of sustainability-oriented projects exploring 
this are: PEIR, an application from CENS at UCLA that tracks 
the user's location and movements using GPS and calculates 
the CO2 impact and the exposure to air pollution [29], and Air 
Quality Egg2, an open source crowdfunded sensor that can 
track NO2 and CO concentrations as indicators of air pollution. 
B. Real time and dynamic feedback 
Other important characteristic is the use of real time and 
dynamic feedback that is up to date with the latest data 
available. This is in contrast with existing sustainability 
approaches, such as LCA, where environmental information is 
mainly collected either in a static, retroactive process or in a 
prognosis, scenario based approach. Smart energy meters, that 
allow real time feedback of electricity consumption, are a 
representative example of this shift towards real time, and they 
are one of the key technologies used in many ICT4S 
behavioral change applications such as in ambient awareness 
projects [20,30]. This acceleration of time is one of the main 
characteristics of ICT and its impact in society [17]. 
C. Transparency and openness 
Much of the existing sustainability data is published in 
commercial databases or expensive journal articles where the 
public does not have access to it, and/or written in paper or in 
a text document where a computer service cannot access it. 
Applying open licenses and machine-readable formats to 
sustainability data can make the information more accessible 
to the general public, and the machine-readability makes 
possible to easily reuse existing data fostering new 
innovations. There are initiatives working in this direction. 
Examples include Earthster3, an upcoming LCA tool with 
focus on open source and visualization, AMEE4 a UK 
company that provide environmental data in a machine-
readable API, ELCD5, a European LCA database that is 
accessible for free in machine-readable XML format, and 
OpenLCA, an open source LCA modeling software [31]. 
D. Dynamic visualization 
New technologies are increasing the possibilities of making 
the visualization more dynamic and interactive. Applications 
such as Webenergy6, HelsinkiCO27, and Carbon.to [32], 
explore this space, allowing users to interact with 
environmental impact analysis, letting the users to change 
parameters of the impact assessment and play with the results,

explore future scenarios, or use representations for better 
communication of quantitative information. 
E. User-driven innovation 
The affordances of information technologies are broadening 
innovation [33], and innovation is now driven not only by 
professionals, but also by end users and amateurs. In the case 
of sustainability practice, the increasing availability of data in 
open and machine-readable formats makes it possible to 
visualize, transform, and remix different datasets, and to 
generate new innovative usages outside the sustainability 
practice community [34]. Another key difference of this 
democratization of innovation is the openness of the process, 
as user innovations are usually freely revealed [33], which 
makes them easier to spread and to be adopted and adapted. 
IV. DATA BLINDNESS 
The focus on quantitative data together with the 
transformative ways of working with data using new 
information technologies create new risks and challenges, 
which I group as “data blindness”, or the risk of trusting only 
or too much in data. 
A. Trusting only on data 
While we have this focus on quantitative data, we have to 
remember that sustainability is a “wicked problem”, not easily 
reduced to numbers and explicitly normative. One side of this 
problem is that a data-driven approach focuses de-facto on 
parts of sustainability that are possible or easy to quantify, 
while other areas that are more challenging to put numbers on 
are neglected. This can be seen in the focus on energy and CO2 
emissions in many studies, for instance in the majority of life 
cycle assessments of ICT [7,35], while other problems such as 
toxicity do not get the same attention. This can also be argued 
in the case of behavioral change interventions, the focus on 
what can be measured means that there is an overrepresentation 
of projects working for instance with electricity consumption, 
while other areas that may be bigger but difficult to calculate, 
such as the impact of the production of consumer goods, are 
not being explored. 
The focus on quantitative data and real-time information 
can create also a kind of time-shortsightedness. The 
quantitative nature of the data makes it difficult to look at long-
term developments concerning the future, as there is no 
measured data for it. Höjer et al. [36] argue that this is a 
common problem for environmental system analysis tools, and 
that there is a need for more prospective thinking and 
integrating with future studies. The real-time focus of ICT can 
accentuate this problem, as data becomes more immediate and 
there is less room for reflection than in traditional 
environmental system analysis tools.  
Brynjarsdóttir et al. [37] discuss some of these problems in 
the context of sustainable HCI, connecting them to the culture 
of modernism, which “trust that formal, rational methods 
capture essentially everything that matters about a given 
situation”. They argue that this axiom of modernism is central 
to many of the persuasion and behavior change projects in 
sustainable HCI, and that it narrows the view of sustainability 
150
assuming that the users are individuals maximizing utility 
based on information. They suggest that there should be a shift 
to more reflection instead of prescription, and to a focus on 
social and cultural practices instead of on individuals. 
B. Trusting too much on data 
Another problem of the focus on quantifiable data is how to 
deal with uncertainty and assumptions. Data such as 
environmental impact analysis or carbon footprints include 
many assumptions and modeled data, it has uncertainties and it 
may not be relevant for the specific case at hand. This is 
challenging to present and the quantitative data may lead to a 
false sense of exactness, as it is argued by Koomey et al 
[38].  These uncertainties are not a specific problem of ICT4S, 
but a general problem in environmental system analysis such as 
LCAs, related to poor data quality, use of aggregated data and 
wrong assumptions [39]. The assumptions in the model can 
also be influenced by the creators’ values, while these choices 
remain mostly invisible to the users of the model. A classical 
example used is how the game SimCity simulates taxes so low-
taxes systems work better than more welfare oriented, thus 
communicating these values to the game users as they learn by 
simulation [40]. This blindness to the shortcoming of modeling 
tools is connected to the modernity values of calculability and 
predictability, the belief that everything can be numerically 
computed and that we can know beforehand the outcome of 
actions [41], in contrast with the wicked nature of 
sustainability, 
which 
includes 
paradoxes, 
complex 
interdependencies and changing requirements.  
The problem with uncertainties and model assumption is 
accentuated when using computer technologies that use 
automatic calculation, crowdsourcing, or mashup and lack the 
textual space for analysis and discussion available in LCAs 
published as scientific articles. This produces new challenges 
that will need to be explored on how to work, calculate and 
communicate the uncertainties in the results. An example can 
be seen in Greenalytics, a web application that uses machine-
readable data and APIs to calculate dynamically the carbon 
footprint of websites using a mashup approach [42]. It provides 
at first sight a very accurate result in kilograms or tons of CO2 
with decimal points. It includes a disclaimer, explaining the 
uncertainties and how the result is not an accurate value but a 
best approximation based on the existing data. The details of 
how the numbers are calculated and the assumptions made are 
also presented. But this result includes many uncertainties and 
assumptions, and communicating these is a challenge [42]. 
C. Trusting in the wrong data 
Another facet if the same problem is trusting in the wrong 
data. Models are imperfect, and when an impact is measured 
and optimized there might be rebound effects outside the 
boundaries of the model. When increasing the efficiency of a 
system, metrics are used to measure the efficiency, but this 
means that it is only the measured metric that will be 
optimized, even if the result for the end goal can be actually 
negative. Hilty et al. [43] explores this problem with efficiency, 
meaning that the efficiency gains of using ICT have been eaten 
up by rebound effects resulting in increasing output, not in 
reducing input. These rebound effects can be created by the 
choice of what is measured, in the case of efficiency it is 
usually the ratio not the total amount. A rebound effect is the 
lost gains in efficiency of technological progress due to that 
cost reduction leads to increased consumption of the same 
service, and/or increase in other spending due to higher income 
and systemic macro-economic effects [44]. This is not 
exclusive to ICT, but endemic to efficiency. A classical 
example is provided by Allenby [45], where he shows how cars 
have increased in fuel efficiency, but the total impact of cars 
have grown as cars are bigger and faster, there are many more 
cars and we drive them more. Hilty argues that using ICT for 
efficiency measures is not an enough precondition for saving 
resources, but that sufficiency measures, focusing on the total 
amount that is needed instead of on the efficiency ratio [46], 
and restricting input and output are needed in order to avoid 
these unwanted rebound effects [45]. 
V. REFLECTIONS 
A focus of ICT4S research in quantitative data comes 
naturally from the affordances provided by ICT and by the 
implicit values of modernity. ICT have developed from 
computing tools and have transformed the way we can manage 
quantitative information, allowing the processing and storage 
of amounts of data that were unthinkable before. The values of 
modernity and informationalism focus also on the use models 
and metrics as a way, or the way, of understanding and 
controlling systems and nature. The use of quantitative data in 
ICT4S is a powerful tool, improving sustainability work by 
making variable visible and creating feedback mechanisms, 
and provides many opportunities for increasing efficiency of 
systems, measuring change, providing feedback on behavioral 
and policy changes, etc.  
ICT can be used for sustainability practice, showing new 
ways of how sustainability data and information can be created, 
shared and visualized through the application of new 
technologies and paradigms, such as APIs, open licenses, 
crowdsourcing, pervasive sensors and mashups. These 
technologies add new affordances and transform the way of 
working with sustainability data: 
• 
There is a focus on providing real time and dynamic 
feedback instead of using past static data. 
• 
The data is gathered in an automatic way from the 
bottom up, instead than top-down approaches, using 
sensors, mashups and crowdsourcing. 
• 
There is a focus on transparency and openness. 
• 
Data is visualized dynamically and interactively. 
• 
The innovation model is more open and broadened 
outside the sustainability field.  
The mostly implicit focus in quantitative data in ICT4S, 
together with these new ways this data is created and 
communicated create risks and missed opportunities that need 
to be explored, what I call data blindness. This can mean that 
we trust only in data, focusing on problems and areas that are 
possible to model, while leaving aside other aspects that are 
difficult or impossible to quantify, and that we trust too much 
in data, forgetting that behind models and calculations there are 
151
assumptions and uncertainties, or that we may be measuring 
the wrong things. This does not mean to oppose to the use of 
quantitative data in ICT4S, but it suggests that more critical 
reflection on these questions is needed in the research area. I 
will present some of the possible action points: 
• Developing more connections with existing research 
on these topics in more traditional disciplines. The 
limitations 
and 
risks 
of 
quantitative 
data 
in 
sustainability have been pointed out before in 
sustainability research. Finnveden [47], for instance, 
discusses the limitations in LCAs and other 
environmental system analysis tools and how data 
gaps, uncertainties in data and methodology, and the 
values embedded, make LCAs limited to provide 
prescription, for instance in deciding if a product is 
better than another one. It is suggested that 
environmental analysis can be a necessary and useful 
input in decision making, but more as a tool for 
learning, helping to identify critical points and in 
general to increase the knowledge of the studied 
systems. There is space for ICT4S research to expand 
the connections with sustainability research from other 
disciplines to gain insight about what it has been done 
already regarding these risks. 
• Distinguishing models as tools and models as goals: 
When 
faced 
with 
uncertainties 
in 
modeling 
sustainability, we can increase the quality of the 
parameters, of the data collected, make it more real 
time, but in the end we still have a model, or as 
Borges wrote in on exactitude in Science, “becomes so 
exact that only a map on the same scale as the empire 
itself will suffice” [48]. I will argue that it is necessary 
to remind us that models and metrics are useful tools 
but in the end only proxies for working towards value-
based human-centered sustainability. In the case of 
efficiency, a similar effect can be observed, where the 
efficiency rate, from being a tool, becomes a goal in 
itself. There is a risk for rebound effects where 
efficiency (what is measured) improves, while the 
total impact (the original goal) increases instead of 
decrease.  
• Increasing transparency: An area where ICT can 
make a difference for mitigating data-blindness is 
increasing 
the 
transparency 
and 
openness 
of 
sustainability data and studies. Much of the existing 
sustainability data is published in commercial 
databases or expensive journal articles where the 
public does not have access to it, and/or written in 
paper or in a text document where a computer service 
cannot access it. Applying open licenses to 
sustainability data (and models) can make the 
information more accessible, easier to replicate, and 
make assumptions visible to examine. 
• Exploring new qualitative areas and research 
methods. A blindspot that is worth exploring are the 
applications of ICT for areas of sustainability and 
environmental impacts that are difficult to quantify 
and have therefore been most forgotten in research. 
This could include, as Brynjarsdottir et al [37] 
suggest, a focus in reflection not in prescription, and a 
shift from behaviors to practices, going beyond the 
focus on individual actions and metrics towards more 
holistic society practices. This type of more qualitative 
research will create also methodological challenges 
and call for more interdisciplinary collaborations in 
ICT4S. 
VI. CONCLUSIONS 
“Grownups love numbers. When you tell them that you have 
made a new friend, they never ask you any questions 
about essential matters. They never say to you, "What 
does his voice sound like? What games does he love best? 
Does he collect butterflies?" Instead, they demand: "How 
old is he? How many brothers does he have? How much 
does he weigh? How much money does his father make?" 
Only from these figures do they think they have learned 
anything about him. […] But certainly, for us who 
understand life, figures are a matter of indifference.”  
– Le Petit Prince [49]  
 
Empowering new ways of creating, processing and 
communicating sustainability data is and will be a main topic 
of ICT4S research, connected to some of the most explored 
parts of the research field such as using technology for 
increasing efficiency and for providing feedback and 
facilitating behavior change. These are powerful ways in which 
ICT can contribute to sustainability work. But there is a need 
for more discussion and reflection on the values and 
assumptions behind the focus on quantitative data, making it 
more explicit instead than being tacit. If not, we risk the 
presented problems of trusting only and/or too much in data or 
focusing on the wrong data and hiding rebound effects. It is 
especially important to identify and work with these specific 
problems and risks when applying new ICT approaches that 
transform how we work with data using mashup approaches, 
sensors, real time data, etc. This paper tried to open a bit more 
this discussion and proposes some action points, such as 
increasing the connection to existing research on traditional 
areas of sustainability research that have a longer tradition on 
dealing with the limitation of quantitative data and models in 
sustainability, to use the affordances of ICT to increase the 
transparency of data and models, and to have a wider 
perspective and explore possible blindspots of relevant topics 
and research methods that we may be missing out on, and that 
could enrich the ICT4S field.

  Main Objective: To design and implement a novel end-to-end automated irrigation management system that integrates IoT sensors, machine learning algorithms, and a user-friendly web interface.
  Study Location: Unspecified
  Data Sources: Field data collected from the automated irrigation system
  Technologies Used: IoT sensors, machine learning algorithms, web interface
  Key Findings: The study demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of using participatory design techniques to develop user-friendly interfaces for automated irrigation systems. The results show that the user interface significantly improved the usability and effectiveness of the system, and farmers were more likely to adopt and use the system when they were involved in its design.
  Extract 1: The study emphasizes the need for user-friendly interfaces that allow farmers to easily input their preferences, constraints, and expert knowledge into the automated irrigation system. The authors argue that such interfaces are crucial for ensuring that the system operates in accordance with the farmer's objectives and management practices.
  Extract 2: To address this need, the study proposes a participatory design approach that involves farmers in the design and evaluation of the user interface. This approach ensures that the interface is tailored to the specific needs and preferences of the farmers, resulting in a system that is more likely to be adopted and used effectively.
  Limitations: The study focuses on the design and implementation of a specific automated irrigation system, and its findings may not be directly generalizable to other systems. Additionally, the study does not evaluate the long-term effectiveness of the user interface in terms of improving irrigation efficiency and crop yields.
  Relevance Evaluation: This paper is highly relevant to the point of providing user-friendly interfaces for automated irrigation systems, as it presents a detailed account of the design and implementation of such an interface. The study highlights the importance of user involvement in the design process and demonstrates how participatory design techniques can improve the usability and effectiveness of the system. The paper's insights on closed-loop control and feedback mechanisms also contribute to the understanding of how automated irrigation systems can be made more responsive and adaptive to changing field conditions.

  Explanation: The first extract is relevant to the point of focus because it discusses the importance of user-friendly interfaces in automated irrigation systems, especially for farmers who may not have a technical background. It specifically mentions that participatory design can be used to develop systems that are easy to use and tailored to the specific needs of the user.
The second extract is also relevant because it discusses the use of soil moisture sensors to help plan irrigation scheduling, rather than relying solely on soil water balance methods. This can be particularly useful in heterogeneous plots where soil water content can vary significantly. The extract discusses the use of capacitance moisture sensors, which are frequently used in agricultural applications due to their accuracy and reliability.
Both extracts provide valuable information that is directly relevant to the point of focus, which is the integration, interoperability, and standardization of automated systems for real-time irrigation management.

Abstract: Recent technological advances have made possible automated irrigation scheduling using
decision-support tools. These tools help farmers to make better decisions in the management of their
irrigation system, thus increasing yields while preserving water resources. The aim of this study
is to evaluate in a commercial plot an automated irrigation system combined with remote-sensing
techniques and soil mapping that allows the establishment of regulated deﬁcit irrigation (RDI)
strategies. The study was carried out over 3 years (2015–2017) in a commercial hedgerow olive
orchard of the variety ‘Arbequina’ located in Alvarado (Extremadura, Spain). An apparent electrical
conductivity (ECa) map and a normalized diﬀerence vegetation index (NDVI) map were generated
to characterize the spatial variability of the plot and classify the zones in homogeneous areas.
Then, reference points were selected to monitor the diﬀerent irrigation sectors. In 2015, the plot was
irrigated according to the farmer’s technical criteria throughout the plot. In 2016 and 2017, two diﬀerent
areas of the plot were irrigated applying an RDI strategy, one under expert supervision and the other
automatically. The results show that in a heterogeneous plot the use of new technologies can be useful
to establish the ideal location for an automatic irrigation system. Furthermore, automatic irrigation
scheduling made it possible to establish an RDI strategy recommended by an expert, resulting in the
homogenization of production throughout the plot without the need for human intervention.

1. Introduction
The olive (Olea europaea L.) tree has traditionally been cultivated in low-density orchards under
rainfed conditions due to the drought tolerance capacity of this evergreen species [1]. However, growth
and yield may be aﬀected by the decrease in the photosynthetic rate of olive cultivars under rainfed
conditions [2]. Since the 1970s there has been a steady increase in the land area occupied by irrigated
olive orchards, which was accelerated by the appearance of super-high density plantations (SHD,
1500–2000 trees/ha) in the 1990s. The main advantage of highly mechanized SHD systems is the
reduction in labor costs during pruning and harvesting. However, such systems require speciﬁc
agronomic techniques and are very costly to set up [3]. Irrigation is very important in SHD olive
groves to ensure high productivity, as the trees have a limited root volume, a high leaf area index and,

in consequence, high water demands [4,5]. However, the application of excessive amounts of water
can lead to uncontrolled vigor, the need for severe pruning to adapt the hedgerow to the operation
of the mechanical harvester, and low lighting in the fruiting areas, producing an imbalance between
growth and productivity [6].
Furthermore, water is a scarce resource [7]. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAO) of the United Nations, agriculture is responsible for over 70% of worldwide water consumption,
and it is estimated that the amounts used for irrigation will rise by 14% in the next 10 years [8].
Therefore, to cope with water scarcity and to improve the proﬁtability of SHD olive groves, water
savings irrigation strategies must be used in order to control hedgerow vigor, as canopies with greater
productive eﬃciency are key to increasing the viability of these systems [9]. RDI is a management
strategy that imposes water deﬁcits in phenological stages less sensitive to drought in order to restrain
vegetative growth while not negatively impacting yield and fruit quality [10,11]. The phenological stage
that is least sensitive to water deﬁcit in the olive tree is the period from pit hardening to veraison [12,13].
Irrigation scheduling requires decision-making with respect to when and how much irrigation
should be applied according to crop type, crop development and environmental conditions. The soil
water balance (WB) method is widely used to determine the irrigation needs of a crop, where the
water inputs to the soil-plant system must be balanced with the expected outputs. The most important
component of the WB is the crop evapotranspiration (ETc) value, which is the crop water need that
considers both evaporation from the soil and transpiration from the plants. The ETc is estimated as
the product of the evapotranspiration of a reference crop (ETo) and a crop coeﬃcient, Kc, in the form
ETc = ETo × Kc [14]. In this relationship, ETo represents the demand imposed by the meteorological
conditions while Kc integrates the physical and biophysical diﬀerences between the reference crop
and the crop which is to be estimated for evapotranspiration [14]. Irrigation scheduling based on WB
presents the advantage of anticipating crop water requirements at certain times during the growing
season and the possibility of planning irrigation accordingly [15]. However, this method presents the
disadvantage that predicted ETc values could be inaccurate because of changes in annual weather
patterns and diﬀerences in the production practices for which the Kc was developed [16]. An alternative
to the WB-based method is to use soil moisture sensors to help plan irrigation scheduling. This method
considers the soil as a water reserve for plant growth, and the idea is to ensure the reserve always
has a suﬃcient amount of water available to the plant. Irrigation control is based on the monitoring
and measurements of soil water content or water potential. Various types of these sensors have been
used to determine soil water content [17]. In addition to the problem of having to weigh up the pros
and cons of the diﬀerent sensor types, the appropriate placement of sensors to accurately reﬂect the
conditions experienced by the plant can be challenging [18]. Consideration needs to be given to the
fact that soil water content patterns in the root zone are dynamic and inﬂuenced by soil hydraulic
properties, spatial heterogeneity, crop characteristics and the irrigation system, among others. In drip
irrigation, the local application of irrigation water results in even higher spatial variability in the soil
water content patterns formed under the emitters [19]. In general, given the beneﬁts and drawbacks of
the WB-based and soil water content monitoring methods, combining both approaches seems the best
way in the future to improve irrigation eﬃciency in agricultural systems: i.e., determine the irrigation
dose from a WB model and then adapt that dosage through the use of sensors to the real situation of
each plot. For this purpose, an interactive software-based decision support system (DSS) can be used
to help decision-makers compile useful information from a combination of raw data, documents and
personal knowledge. This information can then be deployed to identify and solve problems, and make
optimized decisions. The simplest DSS designed to carry out automated irrigation consists of activating
or deactivating irrigation when the sensor measurements are above or below predeﬁned threshold
values [15,20–23]. A more complex proposal is a DSS which combines the WB method with soil or
plant sensors to readjust the ETc [24–27]. Millán et al. [28] used a DSS that executed a pre-established
irrigation scheduling in which RDI was applied without human intervention in a plum crop.

One aspect that complicates the eﬃcient irrigation management of crops is plot heterogeneity,
which depends on factors such as plot size, soil characteristics, orography, previous plot uses, etc. If the
problem of soil spatial variability is not taken into account, an irrigation design may not be eﬃcient [29].
Work on experimental plots rarely addresses these problems, which require the use of specialist tools
to characterize spatial variability. Remote sensing and soil mapping are tools that can be used for
agronomic crop management, allowing characterization of the development of the vegetation cover
and the large-scale water status of the crop. Very interesting results have been obtained for olive groves
with such tools [30]. Using data related to the electrical properties of the soil and multispectral images,
easily available at high resolution, can be the best option to delineate diﬀerent homogeneous zones.
For instance, Pedrera-Parrilla et al. [31] and Moral et al. [32] used soil electrical data for zoning purposes,
and Hall and Wilson [33] and Martínez-Casanovas et al. [34] utilized vegetation indices computed
from multispectral images. The use of satellite data to evaluate changes in vegetation properties aimed
at applications in precision agriculture has also been investigated [35,36]. Coarse resolution satellite
images are useful tools to describe the phenology of the vegetation [37]. Crop monitoring oﬀers direct
information for the analysis of the spatial variability of the crop area. On the basis of such information
management actions can be taken to improve production practices. The information can be used to
adjust and direct fertilization, determine crop development, adapt irrigation to the needs of the crop,
and schedule the harvest. One way to determine crop development is based on the use of reﬂectance
measurements, which diﬀer depending on the type of surface and, in the case of plants, the species,
cultivar, and plant status [38]. From this information, the normalized diﬀerence vegetation index
(NDVI) can be computed (ratio of the diﬀerence of the values of reﬂectance in the near infrared and
red bands and their sum). It is known that NDVI is a good indicator of the state of development of
vegetation and, in consequence, can be used to detect canopy diﬀerences within a ﬁeld [39].
The objectives of this study were to test the technical feasibility and to evaluate the productive
response of a heterogeneous plot in an SHD olive grove cv. ‘Arbequina’ when using a DSS to carry out
a fully automated irrigation scheduling and implementing RDI strategies based on the information
obtained through remote sensing and soil monitoring.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Site Description and Experimental Design
This work was performed over the course of three years (2015–2017) in a 9.31 ha commercial hedgerow
olive grove (Olea europaea L.) planted with cv. ‘Arbequina’. The farm is located in the municipality of
Alvarado, about 16 km east of Badajoz in southwestern Spain (38◦49′27.15” N, 6◦46′ 18.39” W, datum
WGS84). The trees were planted in autumn 2007 at a density of 1.852 olive trees/ha (4 × 1.35 m), with a
north-south orientation and trained to a central axis. The predominant soil in this field was classified as a
Haplic Fluvisol according to the FAO (2006). Soil maintenance involved the practice of non-tillage and the
application of herbicides to ensure it remained free of weeds. The climate of the area is Mediterranean with a
mild Atlantic influence, with a dry season from June to September (summer) and a wet season from October
to May (winter) in which 80% of total precipitation falls. Average ETo and precipitation p-values in the area
were 1188.25 mm and 503.56 mm, respectively, for the 2007–2017 period. For the same period, the average
maximum and minimum air temperature values were 23.49 ◦C and 9.56 ◦C, respectively. The hottest
months are July and August. Maximum temperatures of over 40 ◦C are recorded nearly every year, with
peak values rarely over 45 ◦C. The coolest months are December and January. Temperatures below 0 ◦C
are recorded every year, with minimum values rarely below −5 ◦C. The meteorological information was
obtained from a weather station located in the same study plot at a height of 3 m above ground level (in
line with a tree row).
Trees were irrigated daily using a drip system with a single lateral line per tree row located close
to the base of the tree, with pressure-compensating drippers spaced at 0.67 m and with 1.6 L h−1
discharge rates. The plot is described in more detail in Millán et al. [40].

2.2. Characterization of Spatial Variability of the Plot, Selection of Control Points and Soil Analysis
One very important aspect, which complicates the eﬃcient irrigation management of crops, is plot
heterogeneity. When establishing an automatic irrigation system it is, therefore, important to know the
spatial variation in soil and crop development. A satellite image and a Dualem-1S non-contact sensor
(Dualem, Inc., Milton, ON, Canada) were used to evaluate the heterogeneity of the plot. The NDVI
measurement was provided by the Sentinel-2A (European Space Agency, ESA) satellite with an image
taken in August of 2015 with no cloud cover. The image was processed and analyzed in QGIS 2.18
(https://www.qgis.org) using DOS1 atmospheric correction.
The Dualem-1S sensor was used to measure apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) and was
equipped with a global positioning system (GPS) antenna. The sensor comprised a transmitter
operating at a frequency of 9 kHz and two receivers with diﬀerent orientations. There was a 1 m
separation between the transmitter (Tx) and the two receivers (Rx). The ECa was measured at 0–0.50 m
and 0–1.50 m depths. The sensor was introduced into a 3 m long polyvinyl chloride (PVC) structure
which was transported by a pickup truck traveling at an average speed of 9 km h−1. Due to the height
of the vehicle, ECa readings were carried out of the 0–0.40 m and 0–1.40 m soil layers, assuming that the
ECa of the air is zero. In this study, we used the ECa measurements of the top layer (0–0.40 m). The ECa
measurements were taken in August 2015 along diﬀerent parallel transects that were approximately
4 m apart. The Dualem-1S was programmed to register measurements each second, and a total of
3313 ECa measurements were obtained in the plot. Ordinary kriging was used to develop the ECa map.
Figure 1a shows the soil ECa map and Figure 1b the NDVI map. ECa is related to diﬀerent soil
characteristics that directly or indirectly inﬂuence the availability of water for cultivation. The map
was made in August when the water content was mostly from irrigation. These served as the basis
for determining the control points in the study plot. As seen in Figure 1a, the values classiﬁed as
low, medium and high (because the ECa values may change with diﬀerent water contents in the plot)
allowed identiﬁcation of areas with diﬀerent ECa values in the plot. The highest ECa values were
found in the southwestern, northwestern and eastern areas of the experimental ﬁeld, corresponding to
a higher water retention capacity. Soil texture was one of variables considered in the geostatistical
analysis for identifying the management zones in the plot [40]. Analysis of the satellite image (Figure 1b)
allowed identiﬁcation of the areas with highest and lowest canopy crop development. The NDVI
showed the highest values to be in the northern and central areas of the ﬁeld. These intra-ﬁeld ECa and
vigor diﬀerences are due to a complex interaction of biological, agronomic, edaphic, anthropogenic,
topographic and climatic factors [32].
With the information obtained from Figure 1a,b, a new map was generated (Figure 1c) using the
map algebra tool (raster calculator) in QGIS 2.18. As can be seen in Figure 1c, three diﬀerent zones
were established:
•
Zone 1 (T1): where the ECa and NDVI values were medium or high. The sampling points 1 and
2 were found in this zone.
•
Zone 2 (T2): where the ECa and NDVI values were low. The sampling points 3 and 4 were found
in this zone.
•
Zone 3 (CR): where the ECa values were low and the NDVI values were medium or high.
The sampling control points CR1, CR2, CR3 and CR4 were found in this zone.
The maps made during the ﬁrst year served as a basis to establish in the following seasons in situ
control areas. Each control area consisted of 3 rows of 6 trees each. The various measurements that
were subsequently taken were made in the 4 central trees of each control area.
The DSS-managed automatic irrigation system was established in Zone 3. This had the most
unfavorable conditions for the hedgerow olive grove and corresponded to places with medium or high
vigor and low ECa values. In this zone, three control points were selected CR1, CR2, CR3 (2016 and
2017) (Figure 1) and in 2017 one more control point, CR4 (Figure 1), was added to check the system in
diﬀerent soil and crop conditions

Zones 1 and 2 were used to compare the irrigation scheduling carried out in Zone 3. These two
ﬁrst zones were irrigated according to the expert technical criteria. In both zones, two sampling points
were selected, in Zone 1 (T1) points 1 and 2, and in Zone 2 (T2) points 3 and 4 (Figure 1). At these
points, irrigation volumes were recorded daily using digital water meters (CZ2000-3M, Contazara,
Zaragoza, Spain).

Table 1 shows the soil properties in the study area. Soil samples were collected on 15 November
2015 at the diﬀerent control points whose coordinates were determined using a Mesa-Geode positioning
system (Juniper Systems, Logan, UT, USA) at two depths: at 0.0–0.30 m and at 0.30–0.60 m. All soil
samples were transported to the lab in plastic bags and were air-dried, ground, and passed through a
2 mm sieve. The soil was characterized in terms of texture, pH and organic matter (OM). Soil texture
was determined by mechanical analysis with the hydrometer method [41], pH was measured in a 1:2.5
(soil: water) suspension using the potentiometric method [42] and OM was determined by dichromate
oxidation [43].

2.3. Decision Support System (DSS)
In order to carry out the automatic irrigation, the DSS comprised two components: (a) sensors
installed in the ﬁeld and (b) IRRIX, a web platform whose algorithm is based on a combination of the
water balance with soil moisture sensor feedback adjustment mechanisms.
(a)
Sensors installed in the ﬁeld: to monitor the soil moisture, 10 HS capacitive moisture sensors
(Decagon Devices Inc., Pullman, WA, USA) were installed at diﬀerent positions (position A
and position B) (Figure 2) in the diﬀerent control points selected (CR1, CR2, CR3 and CR4).
Two drippers were monitored at each control point. Four moisture sensors were placed under
each dripper in the position A, two at a depth of 0.30 m and the others at a depth of 0.60 m.
In addition, one measure sensor was situated between the two drippers in the position B at a
depth of 0.30 m (Figure 2). These 5 moisture sensors were installed in each of the control points
(CR1, CR2 and CR3) in 2016, making a total of 15 sensors. In 2017, the number of soil moisture
sensors was increased from 15 to 20, as a new control point was added (CR4). When an error was
detected in any of the sensors that had been installed, that sensor was automatically replaced
with another in the same position.
Sensors 2020, 20, 2526

Figure 2. Sensor location.
A solenoid valve (Rain Bird Europe SCN, Aix-en-Provence, France) and pulse water meter
(Lab-Ferrer S.L., Cervera, Lleida, Spain) were also installed at each control point to measure and
monitor each irrigation event. An air temperature sensor (CS2015, Campbell Scientiﬁc Inc., Logan,
UT, USA) was also installed in a central point of the zone. All sensors were connected to a datalogger
(CR1000, Campbell Scientiﬁc Inc., Logan, UT, USA) via cables. In addition, a voltage regulator
(BlueSolar PWM-Pro, Vitron Energy BluePower, The Netherlands) and a relay module (SMD-CD16AC,
Campbell Scientiﬁc Inc., Logan, UT, USA) were also connected to the datalogger to control the
opening and closing of the solenoid valves according to the programming established by the system.
The program used in the datalogger was written in CR Basic (Campbell Scientiﬁc Inc., Logan, UT,
USA) and implemented the functionalities of an irrigation automata. All data were stored each 5 min.
The data was downloaded to an IRRIX server four times a day.
The distance between the diﬀerent control points for automatic irrigation was limited by the
maximum possible cable distance to maintain the electrical signal with suﬃcient quality. With this
limitation, it was decided to locate the control points in the same area, the most disadvantaged one,
which required more precise control of the irrigation (sandier texture and more vigorous trees).
(b)
IRRIX is a cloud-hosted web platform that carries out the following daily tasks:
1.
Data collection of sensors installed in the ﬁeld (Figure 3). IRRIX downloads sensor data at periodic
intervals throughout the day and at the user’s request.
2.
Analysis of all data and calculation of irrigation water volumes. Once a day, IRRIX analyses
the set of data to determine the irrigation dose using the information provided by the moisture
sensors. To achieve this, this tool integrates an algorithm which combines a WB-based estimation
of crop water needs (feed-forward control) with readjustment based on sensor readings (feedback
control). [25,28,44]
3.
Irrigation scheduling. IRRIX sends the updated irrigation doses to the datalogger. Then, this
device orders the activation of the rest of the equipment (solenoid valve or pumps, etc.) to apply
the required irrigation doses.
4.
Interaction with users. IRRIX is an autonomous system whose main objective is to free the user
from work. The main function of the user is to check that the system has worked correctly.
Logically, if there is any anomaly in the system it has to be resolved by the user.

Figure 3. Tasks carried out by IRRIX.
Before starting the irrigation campaign, the user must input to IRRIX a plan that provides a rough
estimation of how the water will be distributed throughout the campaign. This seasonal plan is drawn
up by an expert who determines the guidelines that the irrigation must follow, in this case taking into
account the deﬁcit periods. This plan represents the cumulative irrigation water amount throughout
the campaign. In order to adapt to the conditions of each year, upper and lower limits are set to this
baseline. For this, a set of curves has to be deﬁned, with the automated control system positioned
between those curves in such a way that the system must be between a maximum and a minimum
cumulative irrigation value.
2.4. Irrigation Scheduling
The irrigation carried out on the plot in the diﬀerent years was the following:
•
In 2015, all the plot zones were irrigated according to the criteria of the farmer.
•
In 2016, all the plot zones were irrigated according to expert technical criteria [45]. In the T1 and
T2 zones, the irrigation scheduling was under human control (non-automatic irrigation scheduling,
NAIS). Irrigation was controlled by solenoid valves operated by a commercial automaton, Agronic
4000 (Sistemes Electrònics Progrés, Palau d’Anglesola, Lleida, Spain), which was programmed
remotely, every Monday, using the desktop application provided by the manufacturer. The CR1,
CR2 and CR3 control points were irrigated automatically through the IRRIX system (automatic
irrigation scheduling, AIS), without human intervention. The scheduled irrigation dose was
independent at each control point. The irrigation criterion was the same in both cases: a light RDI
to preserve oil yield.
Irrigation scheduling was adjusted according to measurements of midday stem water potential
(Ψstem) made in T1 and T2:
#
Phase I, from sprouting (early in March) until the beginning of the olive pit hardening stage
(beginning of July) [45]. The threshold established for Phase I was −1.4 MPa [12], which means
the implementation of only a slight water deﬁcit.
#
Phase II, from the beginning of the hardening of olive pit until the beginning of veraison
(mid-September) [45]. The threshold established for Phase II was −2.0 MPa [12].
Sensors 2020, 20, 2526
9 of 23
#
Phase III, from the end of Phase II until harvest [45]. The threshold established for Phase III was
−1.6 MPa [12].
For T1 and T2, the ETo was calculated according to the formula of Penman and Monteith [14],
modiﬁed using the data obtained through an external meteorological network (REDAREX, http:
//redarexplus.gobex.es), and weekly Ψstem measurements were used to adjust irrigation.
In the case of CR1, CR2 and CR3, the ETo was estimated daily from the air temperature sensor
using the Hargreaves equation [46] and Ψstem values were not used to adjust irrigation. To carry out
irrigation at these points through the DSS, the olive irrigation expert [45] provided a modiﬁed Kc (Kc
mod.) that took into account the deﬁcit irrigation strategy. This Kc mod., which has to be introduced
into IRRIX at the beginning of the irrigation campaign (Figure 4) for the preparation of the seasonal
plan, was established on the basis of technical experience in the same plot with a view to attaining the
target Ψstem for each of the previously described phases. At the CR1, CR2 and CR3 points, irrigation
scheduling was carried out independently and aimed to simulate the irrigation that was carried out in
T1 and T2.
•
In 2017, irrigation scheduling was similar to that of the previous year, but one more control
point was added (CR4) where automatic irrigation was also carried out. As in the other CR
points, the CR4 irrigation scheduling was carried out independently. The CR1 and CR2 automatic
irrigation scheduling was carried out in the DSS on the basis of the information provided by
the sensors located in CR2. In accordance with the evolution of Ψstem, a series of adjustments
were made in 2017 in relation to the seasonal plan (due to the fact that this year was unusually
dry) and the soil comfort zone in relation to the sensor readings. This soil comfort zone speciﬁes
to the control system the acceptable range for the soil moisture sensor measurements and their
pre-established boundaries were empirically readjusted to ﬁt with the observed range.

adjusted to the crop conditions of Extremadura and was calculated with the Orgaz et al. [47] method
using the 10-year average, and Kc mod. was adapted to the deﬁcit irrigation strategy.
A summary of the irrigation scheduling followed in this study is shown in Table 2.

2.5. Physiological and Agronomic Measurements
2.5.1. Water Status and Canopy Volume
The Ψstem was measured once a week with a pressure chamber (Model 3005, Soil Moisture
Equipment Corp., Santa Barbara, CA, USA). One shaded-leaf per tree was selected near the base of the
trunk and covered with aluminum foil at least two hours before the measurements [48]. This selection
was carried out between 12:00 and 13:00 h solar time. Determinations were made in four trees per
control point. The average Ψstem value was used to calculate the irrigation correction in T1 and T2.
This average was compared with the threshold value and the deviation was calculated.
2.5.2. Yield Data and Oil Content
In 2015, yield measurements were made for the T1, T2, CR1, CR2 and CR3 sampling points.
The yield control points were increased by one (CR4) in 2017. At each control point, 4 olive trees were
hand harvested when the trees reached a maturity index (MI) of approximately 2.5. A weekly sampling
was carried out in every control point from the beginning of veraison. On each occasion, a sample of
one hundred olives was classiﬁed in eight color groups, and the MI was calculated according to the
procedure described in [49]. The yield of each tree was weighed separately, and subsamples of 100 olive
fruits from the total harvest of the four trees were collected to determine the average weight of the fruit
and the number of fruits per tree. All subsamples were weighed fresh. Oil content was measured for a
1 kg sample of the four trees by Soxhlet extraction in accordance with EEC Regulation 2568/1991 [50].
For this, the sample was crushed and dried in a DryBig 250 oven (Borel Fours Industriels and Etuves,
S.A., Neuchâtel, Switzerland) at 105 ◦C. In this study, the trees were harvested in late October and
early November.
2.6. Statistical Analysis
An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for the statistical analysis of the data. When signiﬁcant
diﬀerences were detected, a comparison of means was made applying Duncan’s test at p < 0.05.
The statistical package IBM SPSS version 24.0 for Windows (IBM Corp. Armonk, NY, USA) was used.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Climatic Conditions
Table 3 shows the mean temperature (Tmean) and mean relative humidity of the air (RHmean)
for each of the three phases in the three study years as well as the annual mean values, and the
cumulative rainfall, ETc and ETo (calculated using the Penman–Monteith (ETo-PM) and Hargreaves
(ETo-H) methods) values for each of the three phases in the three study years as well as the annual
cumulative values. The highest Tmean and lowest RHmean values were observed in 2017. The highest
Tmean values were reached in Phase II (summer months) in all years, and the lowest in Phase III in
2015 and 2017 and in Phase I in 2016. Cumulative rainfall in the experimental period amounted to
181 mm in 2015, 152 mm in 2016 and 76 mm in 2017. Annual cumulative rainfall ranged from 475 mm
(2016), the rainiest year, to 265 mm (2017), the driest year as well as the year with the highest annual
ETo values. The annual ETo-PM was very similar in the three years of study, with higher values in
Phase I. The ETo-H followed the same seasonal trend as ETo-PM, although with slightly higher values.
The ETo-H overestimated the ETo-PM by 7% on average. The annual ETc was 834 mm, 861 mm and
894 mm for 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively.

3.2. Applied Water
Table 4 shows the irrigation amounts supplied in each phase in the three study years. It should be
noted that 2017 was unusually dry, and so the amount of applied irrigation water was higher due to
the low rainfall and high ETo. Comparing the diﬀerent control points in each zone, it is possible to
observe how in 2015 the irrigation applied was very similar in all cases for each Phase and in total.
In 2016, the AIS zones received less water than T1 and T2, mainly in Phase II with 16% less, with a
consequent total water saving of 24%. It should be noted that at sampling point 4 (in T2) there was an
irrigation system failure during Phase II and, therefore, the water applied in that phase was lower
than for points 1, 2 and 3 in T1 and T2. In 2017, AIS applied more water in Phase I in CR1, CR2 and
CR3 points and less water in Phases II and III than the amounts applied at the T1, T2, T3 and T4 points.
It is observed that the AIS emulates the expert scheduling and obtained a 6% reduction in applied
water compared to the NAIS system. The DSS schedules irrigation independently at each of the points
in accordance with the particular conditions that exist in each zone.
The ability of the automatic system to respond diﬀerently in each of the control points may,
therefore, respond to diﬀerences in soil water reserves which depend on soil texture and crop water
demand at each particular point. This information is provided continuously by the frequency domain
reﬂectometry (FDR) sensors. However, the greater or lesser presence of roots in the area where the
sensors are located also needs to be taken into account. In addition, it is important to consider the
size of the roots as this can aﬀect the readings of the FDR sensors, with an increase in root system size
resulting in increasingly larger underestimations of the true volumetric water content, presumably
because of the water in the roots [51]. With regard to the (rain + irrigation)/crop evapotranspiration
relationship (Table 4), the crop received less water in relation to its needs in 2015, when irrigation was
carried out at the farmer’s discretion.
Figure 5 shows cumulative irrigation at the NASI and AIS points in 2016 and 2017. The irrigation
amount was lower in 2016 than in 2017, as 2017 was a drier year. In 2016, the water applied until early
July was very similar in all points but, after this date, more water began to be applied at T1 and less
water at CR1. In 2017, the irrigation season started a month earlier and the initial irrigations diﬀered at
the diﬀerent points until converging in August. From that date onwards, more water was applied at
CR3 than the rest of the points until the end of the irrigation campaign. As water volumes were higher
in 2017, the maximum and minimum limits are also higher as they were established as percentages
of the campaign schedule. The irrigation pattern was diﬀerent at each CR point, with the greatest

diﬀerences observed in Phase II in the case of CR1, CR2 and CR3. In the case of CR4, the pattern was
diﬀerent from the rest: more water was applied in Phase II and less in Phase III. In summary, the water
applied generally followed the same pattern in the diﬀerent control points in 2016, while in 2017 there
was a change in trend during Phase II.

3.3. Soil Water Content
With respect to soil water content, Table 5 speciﬁes the high and low reference values of each of
the moisture sensors during the years 2016 and 2017. IRRIX establishes two parameters for each sensor:
a high reference (ﬁeld capacity, FC) and a low reference (in deﬁcit irrigation conditions). The high
reference represents the value recorded by that sensor under soil FC conditions, and this value can
be obtained out of season after rain. The low reference is determined for each sensor at the driest
value recorded every day. A more detailed description can be found in Millán et al. [28] of how IRRIX
determines the high and low reference for each sensor. These high and low reference values serve to
reduce the variability between the sensors and to obtain homogeneous reference points for the diﬀerent
sensors. It can be seen in Table 6 that the high reference value of each sensor was higher in 2016 than in
2017, with the exception of sensors 1 (S1) and 3 (S3) located in CR1 and sensor 10 (S10) in CR2. As for
the low reference, the values are lower in 2016 than in 2017 except for the sensors that are located
in position A at 0.60 m in CR1 and CR2 and sensor 12 (S12) in CR3. The references established for
each sensor changed every year, as IRRIX is a dynamic system that adapts to the conditions of each
campaign and even to changes during the campaign itself.

High Reference represents the value recorded by the moisture sensor at conditions of ﬁeld capacity; Low Reference
represents the driest value recorded by the moisture sensor in conditions of deﬁcit irrigation. The high and low
reference values of each of the sensors correspond to the beginning of the irrigation campaign in the diﬀerent years.
The temporal evolution of soil water content (SWC) is presented in Figure 6 for control point
CR2 in 2017. With respect to the position under dripper (A) at 0.3 m depth (Figure 6a,b), the sensors
followed the same overall pattern. These sensors are very sensitive to irrigation, responding quickly
even to low volumes of rain or irrigation. Furthermore, these sensors had a very marked response
amplitude between minimums before irrigation and maximums at the end of irrigation. It can be seen
in Figure 6b that, in Phase II, sensor 8 (S8) presented a diﬀerent behavior to sensor 6 (S6) (Figure 6a),
as the S8 responded to applied irrigation during a certain period of time. This result may be attributable
to the place where the emitter was located because of the spatial variability of the moisture distribution
in the soil.
Probes located at 0.6 m depth (Figure 6c,d) showed less diﬀerence between the maximum and
minimum and also responded quickly to small amounts of rain as did the probes located at 0.3 m.
The two sensors (S7 and S9) showed diﬀerent behavior throughout the study period. Normally, sensors
installed in the same position follow the same pattern but, as sometimes these sensors show a totally
diﬀerent behavior, consideration needs to be given to sensor-to-sensor variability. This variability is
greater in the case of localized irrigation, since wet bulbs are formed around the emitters while the rest
of the soil may be only slightly aﬀected or not at all by the irrigation. Due to the existence of spatial
variability, sensor variability can be aggravated in the case of woody crops since the moisture sensors
need to be installed in the area of the bulb where there may be more roots [25,28]. Kang et al. [51]
indicated that the size of the root can aﬀect the readings of FDR sensors. A careful interpretation is
therefore required when FDR sensors are used to determine soil moisture content. Sensor variability
can also be due to changes that occur in the dielectric properties of the soil [52] or other soil properties,
especially bulk density and the existence of macropores.
The sensors installed in position A at 0.3 m depth presented a range of very diﬀerent measurements.
For example, the S6 had maximum values of 0.447 m3/m3 with a measurement range (the measurement
range is the sensor reading at the beginning and end of the irrigation season) of about 0.371 to
0.389 m3/m3 while the S8 presented maximum values of 0.385 m3/m3 with a measurement range of
0.331 to 0.334 m3/m3. At 0.6 m depth, the measurement ranges between sensors located under the same
position also varied considerably. The S7 had maximum values of 0.419 m3/m3 with a measurement
range of about 0.309 to 0.338 m3/m3 and the S9 presented maximum values of 0.394 m3/m3 with a
measurement range of 0.213 to 0.307 m3/m3. It must be considered that as sensor depth increases the
presence of water in the lower layers is greater, which may be due to the arrival of water from other
points. In addition, soil moisture ﬂuctuations decreased with depth. Mittelbach et al. [53] established
that 10HS sensors do not capture the daily soil moisture content ﬂuctuations for moist conditions and
that soil moisture ﬂuctuations are almost negligible at 0.25 m depth and below.
In the position between drippers (B) at 0.30 m depth (Figure 6e), the sensors responded to low
applications of rain or irrigation. It can be seen how sensor 10 (S10) was sensitive to small irrigation
amounts and showed a greater amplitude between the maximum and minimum during the study
Sensors 2020, 20, 2526
15 of 23
period. In the case of S10, the values of the measurements of the 10HS probes did not surpass
0.371 m3/m3. This may mainly be due to the creation of preferential channels in the soil and, because
of this, the water from one or more drippers moving to the place where the sensor is located.
It should be noted that Phase I corresponds to a period of mild stress, and a slight decrease in the
amount of water in the soil is observed in Figure 6a,c,d and a more pronounced decrease in Figure 6b.
In Phase II there is a clear decrease in SWC in Figure 6a–d. In Phase III there is a delay in the response
to the increase in irrigation that coincides with the onset of rainfall.

3.4. Crop Water Status and Productivity
Figure 7 shows the Ψstem evolution in 2015 (Figure 7a), 2016 (Figure 7b) and 2017 (Figure 7c) for
all control points. A declining trend of Ψstem can be seen in Phases I and II as the irrigation season
advanced, followed by an increase in Phase III to the end of the irrigation campaign. In 2015 (Figure 7a),
when all the areas were irrigated according to the farmer’s criteria, there was a marked diﬀerence in
Ψstem at the diﬀerent control points. At all points, Ψstem was above the reference threshold value in
all three phases (shown by a horizontal dotted line in all the ﬁgures), except in zone T2 which fell
below it on several days in Phase II. The highest values, recorded in Phase I at the beginning of spring,
were around −0.66 MPa, −0.87 MPa, −0.79 MPa, −0.70 MPa and −0.57 MPa for T1, T2, CR1, CR2 and
CR3, respectively. The minimum Ψstem was at mid-summer in Phase II with average values of −1.67,
−2.43 MPa, −1.12 MPa, −1.22 MPa and −1.67 MPa in T1, T2, CR1, CR2 and CR3, respectively.
In 2016 (Figure 7b), when introducing the expert criteria for irrigation scheduling, the differences
in water status between the different control points throughout the entire irrigation season decreased,
but especially in Phase II. Higher Ψstem values were obtained in CR1 and CR2 than the other control
points throughout the irrigation season, while CR3 presented the lowest Ψstem values of around −2.36 and
−2.69 MPa reaching the pre-established threshold in Phase II and Phase III, respectively. T1 and T2 also
remained above the pre-established limits throughout the irrigation season, except for the days on
which CR3 remained below the pre-established limits in Phase II and Phase III, because there was an
irrigation failure.
In 2017, the AIS achieved a greater adjustment at CR1 and CR2 to the Ψstem targets. CR4 had
a similar evolution of Ψstem to the other control points. Greater homogeneity in crop water status
between the diﬀerent points was achieved in 2017 than in 2016.
The Ψstem values where AIS was carried out followed the same pattern as the Ψstem values in
T1 and T2 (NAIS) in 2016 and 2017, despite the application of diﬀerent irrigation volumes, due to
dosage readjustment made by the IRRIX system with the information provided by the soil probes.
The typical spring rainfall and the accumulation of water reserves in the soil during autumn and winter
can make it diﬃcult to induce water stress, and the Ψstem values can sometimes exceed the proposed
thresholds during the irrigation season [13,54–60]. In addition, the algorithm used in the areas where
irrigation was carried out automatically showed a good response to the RDI strategies. While some
researchers have previously worked with a web platform whose algorithm results from a combination
of the water balance with feedback from soil moisture sensors to perform automatic irrigation [24–26],
this is the ﬁrst time that the algorithms used to establish the automated irrigation have been shown to
respond well to RDI in an olive grove, maintaining the water status of the plant.

The results for yield, number of fruits per tree, oil yield and water productivity (WP) for olives
and for oil are presented in Table 6. In 2015, signiﬁcant diﬀerences between diﬀerent control points
were found in yield, number of fruits per tree, oil yield and WP, with CR2 the least productive and
with signiﬁcant diﬀerences with T2. In 2016, CR1 and CR3 showed no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in yield
with respect to irrigation carried out with expert supervision. However, CR2 had lower yield, number
of fruits per tree, oil yield, WP yield and WP oil yield than the other control points, which could be
due to alternation in crop yield between more and less productive years as is common in this cultivar.
With regard to 2017, yield increased in all control points, with CR2 the most productive. In addition,
the WP yield and the WP oil yield also increased notably compared to the previous two years, with
52 kg of olives and about 8.5 kg of oil produced per cubic meter of water provided in CR2. This can be
attributed to the lower crop load level in CR2 in 2015 and 2016. The number of fruits per tree also
increased with respect to previous years, being signiﬁcantly higher in CR1 and CR2. No statistically
signiﬁcant diﬀerences were found in oil yield at the diﬀerent control points.

Introducing the strategy recommended by the expert led to an increase in yield and a tendency to
ploy homogenization in 2017, especially with respect to oil production which showed no statistically
signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the various control points. Moriana et al. [12] previously demonstrated
that the RDI strategy used in this experiment and for this crop presented signiﬁcant diﬀerences in yield
or oil yield with respect to a control treatment in which the trees were irrigated with 100% ETc.
The heterogeneity of a commercial plot irrigated with the same criteria causes diﬀerences between
the various plants on the plot. By characterizing this variability and considering these diﬀerences for
irrigation scheduling, the use of RDI strategies has been shown to lead to greater plot homogenization.
This is of great importance for the use of automated irrigation systems where the selection of the control
zone(s) that will govern decision making is important. Automatic irrigation has been shown to be
capable of simulating expert judgement in the application of RDI strategies based on crop water status.
The system improved its performance after the ﬁrst year of adjustment. Recent studies have reported
that RDI strategies can be advantageous in SHD olive orchards in terms of reducing water applications,
decreasing excessive tree vigor, improving irradiance environments and increasing yield, oil quality
and water-use eﬃciency [1,6,61–63]. The results of the present study provide evidence that an RDI
strategy can be applied through a DSS in a plot of SHD olive orchards with no negative eﬀects on yield,
number of fruits per tree, oil yield, WP yield or WP oil yield, if there is prior spatial characterization
and pre-established criteria for decision making. Characterization of the spatial variability of the plot
is very important in the case of a hedgerow olive grove, since an area with greater vigor is not always
related to higher productivity [40]. In addition, a better irrigation management in an area with lower
water retention capacity (sandy soil) allows more balanced vegetative growth, which is necessary for
hedgerow olive grove productivity [64]. Phase II is considered the most important for an automatic
irrigation system, and adjustment of the deﬁcit irrigation dosages determined by a ﬁeld expert can be
better controlled by an automatic system analyzing crop water needs and soil moisture. During this
phase, plant water status can be better controlled in more unfavorable zones, enabling all ﬁeld zones to
enjoy the correct water status.
4. Conclusions
This work aimed to evaluate and develop an automated irrigation protocol in a hedgerow
olive orchard using the IRRIX platform. In this case, the device had to simulate a recommended
irrigation strategy for this type of plantation that included the use of regulated deﬁcit irrigation.
The characterization of the spatial variability was useful to locate the control points.
The automatic irrigation scheduling simulated the expert criterion, adapting to the speciﬁc
conditions of the control point where the soil sensors were installed. The total amount of manually
and automatically applied irrigation water was similar at the various control points, but not its
distribution as the DSS estimated the water needs by combining the water balance method with a
feedback mechanism based on the moisture sensor readings. In addition, the DSS was able to establish
an RDI strategy which induced moderate-to-severe stress during Phase II of the crop in the parts of the
plot with the most unfavorable conditions for the hedgerow (places with high vigor and low ECa).
The adoption of an appropriate RDI strategy in an SHD olive grove enabled homogenization of plot
yield, with a tendency to increase production. The automatic irrigation allowed irrigation management
with minimum human intervention.
The results obtained with the system improved in the third year, when adjustments were made
based on the information collected in the previous year. The automated irrigation has proven to be
able to adapt to the particular conditions of the place where it is installed and to the diﬀerent growth
stages of the crop, thus improving the key eﬃciency parameters.
Automatic irrigation scheduling is of particular interest in the case of olive groves. In this
crop, monitoring stem water potentials at commercial level for crop phase dosage readjustment is
complicated by the strongly negative values that can be attained but which cannot be measured with a
pump-up pressure chamber.

Although the results were encouraging, further studies are required to improve certain aspects of
the system, particularly relating to the integration of the NDVI and ECa measurements into the DSS.

  Explanation: Stability, robustness, vulnerability, and resilience are all concepts used to describe the ability of agricultural systems to cope with various types of perturbation (i.e., changes in environmental or socio-economic constraints). While they share some similarities, each concept has its own unique focus and set of assumptions. 

* **Stability** refers to the ability of a system to maintain a constant state or condition over time, even in the face of disturbances. In agricultural systems, stability is often measured in terms of crop yields, livestock production, or farm income. A stable agricultural system is one that is able to maintain a relatively consistent level of output, regardless of the challenges it faces.
* **Robustness** refers to the ability of a system to withstand or recover quickly from disturbances. In agricultural systems, robustness is often measured in terms of the system's ability to maintain productivity in the face of environmental stresses such as drought, flooding, or disease. A robust agricultural system is one that is able to bounce back from setbacks and continue to produce food, even under challenging conditions.
* **Vulnerability** refers to the degree to which a system is susceptible to harm from disturbances. In agricultural systems, vulnerability is often measured in terms of the system's exposure to hazards, its sensitivity to those hazards, and its capacity to adapt to or recover from them. A vulnerable agricultural system is one that is at high risk of being damaged by disturbances.
* **Resilience** refers to the ability of a system to absorb change and continue to function. In agricultural systems, resilience is often measured in terms of the system's ability to adapt to new conditions, learn from past experiences, and transform itself in response to changing circumstances. A resilient agricultural system is one that is able to withstand shocks, adapt to change, and continue to provide food for future generations.

Abstract Global warming and price volatility are increasing
uncertainty for the future of agriculture. Therefore, agricultur-
al systems must be sustainable not only under average condi-
tions, but also under extreme changes of productivity, econo-
my, environment and social context. Here, we review four
concepts: stability, robustness, vulnerability and resilience.
Those concepts are commonly used but are sometimes diffi-
cult to distinguish due to the lack of clear boundaries. Here,
we clarify the role of these concepts in addressing agronomic
issues. Our main findings are as follows: (1) agricultural sys-
tems face different types of perturbations, from small and
usual perturbations to extreme and unpredictable changes;
(2) stability, robustness, vulnerability and resilience have been
increasingly applied to analyze the agricultural context in or-
der to predict the system response under changing conditions;
(3) the four concepts are distinguished by the nature of the
system components and by the type of perturbation studied;
(4) assessment methods must be tested under contrasted situ-
ations; and (5) the major options allowing system adaptation
under extreme and unpredictable changes are the increase of
diversity and the increase of the adaptive capacity.

perturbations, i.e. changes in environmental or socio-
economic constraints which cannot be anticipated. Facing
uncertainties, farmers have to deal not only with urgent
and short-term tactical issues (e.g. protecting a crop from
pests or taking advantage of sowing opportunities) but also
with more strategic decisions driven by their medium- to
long-term objectives (Rodriguez et al. 2011). In general,
the predominant approach to mitigate the impacts of exoge-
nous changes on cropping and livestock systems is based on
controlling environmental conditions (ten Napel et al. 2006).
Modern intensive farming, which relies heavily on pesti-
cides, antibiotics, mineral fertilizers and irrigation in order
to control system conditions, has proven to be a successful
approach to maximize productivity per production unit and
increase agricultural production in the world. The most il-
lustrative example of this approach is greenhouse production
where fruits and vegetables are grown in a highly standard-
ized and controlled environment. Nevertheless, evidence of
drawbacks of this approach is accumulating: despite a strong
artificialization of agricultural landscapes and intensive use
of chemical inputs, crops and livestock around the world are
still exposed to various types of exogenous perturbations,
such as outbreaks of infectious diseases in animal production
and development of pest and pathogen resistances to pesti-
cides in crop production. Moreover, negative environmental
impacts of intensive farming systems are evident, such as air
and water pollution and loss of biodiversity (Millennium
Ecosystem Assessment 2005).
In recent years, social and political pressure for more sus-
tainable agricultural systems showed up the need for
implementing more sustainable production systems and led
to the emergence of various methods and indicators to quan-
tify the sustainability of farming activities. These methods
generally include economic, environmental and societal pil-
lars and are usually based on multicriteria approaches address-
ing these different issues (Bockstaller et al. 2009). However,
these methods are generally focused on the assessment of
average agricultural outputs (i.e. under conditions that are
considered as “normal”) and do not consider performance
changes in time and space, particularly when exogenous per-
turbations occur. Thus, scientists and stakeholders are current-
ly reconsidering agricultural system design in order to better
take into account the variability of environmental conditions
(Naylor 2008). As part of this new vision, changes and adap-
tations are recognized as essential elements: the ability to con-
tinue to achieve goals despite the occurrence of perturbations
is becoming a central issue in the assessment of agricultural
sustainability (Tendall et al. 2015). This concern is generally
expressed through a paradigm shift, from maximizing average
productivity in a stable environment towards reducing
performance changes in an environment subject to greater
variation (Milestad et al. 2012). However, this transition re-
quires new knowledge and expertise to characterize and assess
the ability of agricultural systems to maintain high levels of
agricultural outputs in a non-stable environment (Fig. 1).
In the face of this challenge, different concepts such as
stability, robustness, vulnerability and resilience have been
developed in recent decades. Despite conceptualization from
different discipline backgrounds, these four concepts all focus
on the ability of diverse systems to maintain or recover their
functionalities in a challenging environment. An increasing
number of review articles illustrate the growing interest of
scientists from different disciplines in these concepts (see,
for example, Mumby et al. (2014) for a review of resilience,
robustness and vulnerability applied to marine ecosystems;
Gallopín (2006) for a review of vulnerability and resilience
applied to socio-ecological systems; and Mens et al. (2011) for
a review of robustness, resilience and vulnerability applied to
flood risk management). These concepts have also been used
in agricultural sciences, either as equivalent terms (National
Research Council 2010) or as concepts to be combined for a
more comprehensive and integrative approach (Callo-Concha
and Ewert 2014). Due to fuzzy boundaries between these four
concepts, we have noticed the difficulty for some scientists in
agricultural sciences in defining them correctly and under-
standing their differences and potential uses. Furthermore, a
clear analytical framework associated with each concept is
still lacking and hence limits their usefulness to assess the
ability of agricultural systems to cope with perturbations.
In the present paper, we aim to clarify the potential of
stability, robustness, vulnerability and resilience as opera-
tional concepts to assess the ability of agricultural systems
to deal with a context of increasing uncertainty. In the
following sections, the paper will first introduce agricultural
systems and their exposure to exogenous changes (Sect. 2).
Then, we will review different strands of literature to define
more clearly each concept and assess their differences and
respective uses in agricultural sciences (Sect. 3). Based on
recent papers, we will discuss operational methods avail-
able to characterize and quantify the ability of agricultural
systems to cope with various types of perturbation
(Sect. 4). Finally, the paper will outline some key levers
to improve the ability of agricultural systems to deal with a
more changeable environment (Sect. 5).
2 Agricultural systems facing a more changeable
environment
In order to explore the position of each concept regarding the
assessment of agricultural performance in a variable environ-
ment, we start by clarifying what agricultural systems are and
what are their interactions with external drivers.

2.1 Agricultural systems
Agricultural systems are socio-ecological systems, compris-
ing biotechnical and social factors, and dedicated to the pro-
duction of productive, economic, environmental and social
outputs (Renting et al. 2009). On the one hand, biotechnical
factors consist of biological and technical components linked
through feedback mechanisms (ten Napel et al. 2011).
Biological components comprise not only domesticated plant
and animal species but also non-domesticated species like
pests and pollinators of crops. Technical components consist
of engineering elements designed to optimize agricultural out-
puts (e.g. irrigation system and decision support tools). On the
other hand, social factors refer to farmers’ actions and atti-
tudes and in which may be considered separately the psycho-
logical make-up of the farmer and the characteristics of the
farm household (Edwards-Jones 2006).
According to this basic conceptual scheme, the agricultural
outputs of a farm are highly influenced by the interaction
between the different components that constitute biotechnical
and social factors. However, agricultural systems are also em-
bedded in larger systems such as food, institutional or social
systems. Hence, they are also influenced by external drivers
which can be a source of unpredictable changes for farmers.
2.2 A more changeable environment
External drivers of agricultural systems encompass bio-geophys-
ical, social, economic and political environments that determine
how agricultural activities are performed. These drivers can vary
significantly in time and space and therefore can affect
agricultural systems positively or negatively. Depending on the
frequency, duration and predictability of these changes, Maxwell
(1986) distinguished four different types of perturbations that
affect agricultural systems: noise when perturbations occur on a
regular basis and are usually expected by farmers, shocks when
perturbations are unusual and difficult to anticipate, cycles when
the variation is due to cyclical changes, and trends when the
change is gradual over time.
In terms of trends, global warming is expected to impact
agricultural activities gradually in the future: by the end of the
twenty-first century, temperature is projected to rise by 1.4 to
5.8 °C while atmospheric CO2 concentration could reach three
to four times the pre-industrial levels (IPCC 2014). In Europe,
simulations of future climate have suggested an increase of
average temperature and a slight decrease in rainfall (Trnka
et al. 2011). Livestock systems may also be impacted by glob-
al warming, directly by the effects of heat on animal health,
growth and reproduction and, indirectly, for herbivores,
through impacts on the productivity of pastures and forage
crops (Maracchi et al. 2005). Climate change is also expected
to increase the risk of potential pest pressure in agriculture by
providing more suitable environmental conditions for exotic
pests to adapt across areas which were previously detrimental
for their survival (Lamichhane et al. 2014). In this context of
gradual changes, farmers and researchers can partly anticipate
the impacts on agricultural activities through mitigation and
adaptation programs (Olesen et al. 2011; Reidsma et al. 2010).
For example, many research and implementation projects are
currently dealing with adaptation strategies using local knowl-
edge and low inputs for soil protection and water management
in the context of climate change (Meynard et al. 2012).
Beyond average trends, agricultural systems are also ex-
posed to less predictable perturbations, such as climatic or
economic shocks. These perturbations, exhibiting various in-
tensities and durations, can also heavily impact agricultural
activities. For example, climate variability is considered to
explain part of wheat yield stagnation in Europe since the
middle of the 1990s (Brisson et al. 2010; Moore and Lobell
2014), while food price volatility has negatively impacted
farmers’ income stability in recent years (Huchet-Bourdon
2011). In addition to these individual perturbations, local is-
sues may also interact with global economic issues and further
increase overall perturbations. For example, due to the speci-
ficities of the world agricultural market (inelastic demand for
agricultural products, high seasonality and relatively long pro-
duction period coupled with a short shelf-life for many agri-
cultural products), a severe climatic shock, such as drought on
grain production in an exporting country, may have significant
repercussions on international, national and local markets and,
therefore, on food security and political stability on local and
global scales (Sternberg 2012).
Furthermore, the relationship between agricultural systems
and their external drivers requires that the intrinsic sensitivity
of agricultural systems to exogenous perturbations be taken
into account. For example, the impact of market volatility
Fig. 1 Agricultural systems are facing multiple and unpredictable
perturbations. The impact on a sunflower field of salted sea water
flooding induced by Xynthia storm in 2010, in Rochefort area (France).

during the period 2007 to 2009 was particularly severe in
Europe as the progressive change of CAP policies more di-
rectly exposed farmers to commodity price volatility (Enjolras
et al. 2014). Moreover, there is also increasing evidence that
the trend towards specialization and homogenization of genet-
ic diversity across agricultural landscapes (Hoisington et al.
1999) is increasing the sensitivity of many agricultural sys-
tems around the world to various types of perturbation. In
cropping systems, for example, genetic and crop uniformity
over large areas tends to amplify pest invasions and outbreaks
(Altieri and Nicholls 2004), while in animal husbandry, re-
gional specialization of agricultural activities can increase san-
itary risks by facilitating the spread of animal diseases Fèvre
et al. (2006).
In this context and in order to get a better under-
standing of the overall context in which agricultural
systems are implemented, researchers have developed
and used several concepts that deal with the response
of agricultural systems when facing perturbations. In the
next section, we introduce these different concepts, their
historical backgrounds and their main differences ac-
cording to how the relationship between agricultural
systems and perturbations is expounded.
3 Conceptual frameworks
We focus on four different concepts: stability, robustness, vul-
nerability and resilience. These four concepts are character-
ized by having a highly multidimensional nature and have
been used in various papers related to agricultural systems.
At first glance, they may appear to be linked by fuzzy bound-
aries and to be suitable in various contexts. Depending on
authors, there is a call for more stable (Mishra and Sandretto
2002), more robust (ten Napel et al. 2006), less vulnerable
(Schröter et al. 2005) or more resilient (Naylor 2008) agricul-
tural systems and sometimes a combination of all of these (de
Goede et al. 2013; Tendall et al. 2015).
In order to clarify the specificities of each concept and
based upon the existing literature, we will present in this
section their historical backgrounds and their main
differences according to how they are used in papers related
to agricultural systems. More precisely, each concept is
discussed separately in order to highlight in which context it
proved to be the most useful. As already pointed by Carpenter
et al. (2001) concerning resilience, these multidimensional
concepts acquire significance only if the studied object (the
system and its boundaries), the type of output to be maintained
and the nature of the perturbations are precisely defined. Thus,
we will answer simple but essential questions when assessing
each concept: what kind of system is studied, what kind of
output is targeted and against what kind of perturbation?
Table 1 summarizes the main elements for each concept
and includes some examples from agricultural sciences. It
may help readers to choose the most suitable concept accord-
ing to the nature of their research questions.
3.1 The concept of stability
The word stability originates from the Latin stabilis, meaning
to stand firm or steady. It has been widely used in several
scientific disciplines (mathematics, engineering, economic,
social and natural sciences) to express the ability of an object
to maintain equilibrium. In natural sciences, the concept of
ecological stability was first defined as the constancy of a
given attribute, regardless of the presence of disturbing factors
(Justus 2008). For example, stable ecological communities
were those with relatively constant population sizes and com-
positions (MacArthur 1955). Later, the definition of ecologi-
cal stability has been expanded to describe other properties of
ecosystems, such as the ability to maintain ecological func-
tions despite disturbances (Turner et al. 1993) or the ability to
return to the initial equilibrium state (Ives and Carpenter
2007). This led to multiple definitions and interpretations of
stability (Grimm and Wissel 1997) and sometimes to the feel-
ing that it is defined in many ways depending on how scien-
tists wish to look at the problem (Lin et al. 1986).
In agricultural sciences, the concept of stability has been
mainly used with the original meaning of ecological stabil-
ity, i.e. as a criterion to measure the spatial or temporal
constancy of specific features of agricultural systems
(Fig. 2a). For example, the stability of genotypes has been
widely used in plant breeding programs in order to identify
genotypes that maintain specific features (e.g. yield or pro-
tein content in the grain) over a wide range of environments
(Brancourt-Hulmel 1999; Sabaghnia et al. 2012). Based on
genotype × environment interactions, two types of stability
are sometimes distinguished: (i) static stability which refers
to a genotype for which variance is small between different
environments and (ii) dynamic stability which refers to a
genotype for which the response to various environments
is correlated to the mean response of all genotypes in the
trial (Annicchiarico 2002). In other terms, the first type of
stability focuses on constancy regardless of the variability in
system environments whereas the second type of stability
includes these environmental differences.
Even though analysis of yield stability has been largely
confined to multienvironment trials for comparing spatial sta-
bility of crop cultivars, stability analysis has also been applied
to compare the temporal stability of different agronomic treat-
ments in long-term experiments. For example, Berzsenyi et al.
(2000) and Govaerts et al. (2005) implemented stability anal-
ysis to evaluate the effect of diverse crop rotations, fertiliza-
tion treatments or tillage management techniques on crop
yield stability.

Considering these first elements, it appears that the
concept of concept has been applied in agricultural stud-
ies with a meaning relatively close to ecological con-
stancy, i.e. as the stability of agricultural outputs in time
or space but without explicitly referring to the external
drivers of change and to the occurrence of perturbations.
Moreover, the concept of stability has been mainly ap-
plied to individual components (e.g. genotypes) or out-
puts (e.g. yield or income) of agricultural systems rather
than through a more integrated approach. Hence, it may
show a low potential for describing and explaining the
behaviour of complex agricultural systems in a context
of unpredictable changes.
3.2 The concept of robustness
The word robustness comes from the Latin robustus,
meaning strong. Widely used in statistics to refer to
methods that are not affected by small deviations from
model assumptions (Maronna et al. 2006), robustness also
emerged in recent years as a major concept for analyzing
the response of diverse objects facing perturbations.
Industrialists and engineers first mobilized this concept in
the early 1950s in order to optimize the manufacturing
design of various devices and reduce their sensitivity to
variation over which makers have little or no control
(Taguchi and Clausing 1990). Subsequently, robustness

theory was applied to various engineering processes, such as
information networks, electronic circuits or flight control sys-
tems, in airplanes in order to make them capable of operating
under a wide range of constraints (Fowlkes et al. 1995).
More recently, the concept of robustness has also been used
by biologists to describe the ability of living systems to main-
tain specific functionalities despite unpredictable environmen-
tal or genetic perturbations (Kitano 2004). For example, bio-
logical robustness can be illustrated by the ability of genomes
to compensate for the loss of function in one gene by means of
other copies of this gene (Gu et al. 2003). Based on these
observations from engineering and biological sciences, ro-
bustness has been described as an intrinsic property of com-
plex adaptive systems (Carlson and Doyle 2002) and as an
important trait for the species’ capacity to evolve through
natural selection (Wagner 2008).
Comprising both technical and biological domains, agricul-
tural systems can also be defined as complex and adaptive
systems. Hence, the robustness concept was recently intro-
duced into agricultural sciences and has been used in an in-
creasing number of scientific papers to represent the complex
interactions between the biotechnical factors of agricultural
systems and external drivers of change (de Goede et al.
2013; ten Napel et al. 2006; Verhagen et al. 2010). In these
papers, robustness has been mainly defined as the ability to
minimize the variability of specific agricultural outputs despite
the occurrence of explicitly defined perturbations (Fig. 2b).
A large part of the literature recently devoted to this subject
deals with robustness as a key breeding goal for animal farms
(Knap 2005; Sauvant and Martin 2010; Star et al. 2008). The
aim is to select animals that achieve a high production level in a
wide diversity of environmental conditions, including stressful
conditions. These stressors can be disease challenges, extreme
temperatures, low-quality feed or challenges due to changes in
housing or management (Merks et al. 2012). However, robust-
ness has also been discussed in the context of cropping systems
exposed to climatic or biotic perturbations. For example,
Sabatier et al. (2013) compared the robustness of two contrast-
ing types of management strategies for a cacao agroecosystem
in Indonesia facing pest outbreaks and pesticide changes.
Applied to agricultural systems facing an environment sub-
ject to perturbations, two forms of robustness are frequently
distinguished and sometimes called, respectively, passive and
active robustness: (i) resistance, i.e. the withstanding or toler-
ance of perturbations, and (ii) flexibility, i.e. the ability to
adapt the configuration of the system in order to limit damage
(ten Napel et al. 2006). For example, robustness on a pig farm
level can include genetic components of heat stress tolerance
in pigs (passive robustness) and temperature control systems
to adjust indoor conditions in real time (active robustness).

To conclude, we might say that robustness is a concept that
goes further than stability through a more precise description
of the interactions between agricultural systems (and their
different components) and changes in environmental condi-
tions. Due to its history, robustness appears to be a concept
that better integrates biological and technical aspects of agri-
cultural systems than stability. However, it rarely takes into
consideration the social aspects of agricultural systems.
3.3 The concept of vulnerability
The term vulnerability originates from the Latin word vulnus,
meaning injury. Vulnerability thus refers to a state of fragility, a
disposition to be hurt. This concept started to be used in the
1970s by geographers and social scientists in risk management
issues to describe the fragility of certain communities or coun-
tries facing severe environmental or socio-economic risks,
such as earthquakes (Blaikie et al. 1994) or food exchange
crises (Watts and Bohle 1993). In the decade after 2000, the
use of the vulnerability concept increased sharply with its
adoption by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
(IPCC) to assess the potential impacts of global warming at
regional and global levels (Mc Carthy et al. 2001). As a result,
vulnerability recently became a very central focus of the global
change science research community for discussing and defin-
ing adaptation and mitigation plans (Downing et al. 2005).
Based on the seminal work by IPCC, the vulnerability con-
cept benefits from a highly operational framework to describe
the relationship between the studied system and its environ-
ment (Adger 2006; Luers et al. 2003; Paavola 2008; Turner
et al. 2003). This framework usually distinguishes between
three distinct elements (Fig. 2c): (i) the level of exposure
(i.e. the frequency, intensity and duration of perturbations af-
fecting the studied system), (ii) the level of sensitivity (i.e. the
degree to which the studied system is affected by exposure to
perturbations) and (iii) the adaptive capacity (i.e. the ability of
the studied system to deal with perturbations and increase the
extent of variability that it can cope with).
This operational framework of vulnerability has allowed its
use in several fields, including agriculture for which it has
been applied at various spatial scales (from farms to countries)
but with an emphasis on the regional level (Reidsma and
Ewert 2008; Simelton et al. 2009). The vulnerability of agri-
cultural systems has mainly been studied with regard to the
exposure to climatic perturbations, such as temperature chang-
es (Luers et al. 2003), drought (Simelton et al. 2009) or floods
(McLeman and Smit 2006; Silva and Lucio 2014). It has also
been used to describe the response of agricultural systems
exposed to diverse socio-economic changes, such as market
fluctuations (Luers et al. 2003) or land use changes (Metzger
et al. 2006). Sensitivity level generally refers to biotechnical
or socio-economic factors that are intrinsic to agricultural sys-
tems and interact with external perturbations to amplify or
reduce their impacts. For example, the level of sensitivity of
a crop to drought depends to a high degree on soil character-
istics and access to irrigation (Wilhelmi and Wilhite 2002). At
regional level, the level of sensitivity of Indian farmers to
international trade has been evaluated as a function of crop
productivity and distance to major ports (O’Brien et al. 2004).
The third factor of vulnerability, the adaptive capacity of
agricultural systems, is usually described as the system’s ability
to design and implement effective changes so as to reduce the
impacts of harmful perturbations. In practice, adaptive capacity
represents the set of natural, financial, institutional or human
resources that agricultural systems can mobilize for coping
with constraints and overcoming them (Brooks and Adger
2005). Hence, the adaptive capacity of agricultural systems
encompasses both internal and external factors that can be
used to deal with a changeable environment. For example,
Tengö and Hammer (2003) analyzed the role of both manage-
ment practices and the institutional framework for promoting
the adaptive capacity of northern Tanzanian agro-pastoralists.
Thus, vulnerability can be seen as a concept mainly focused
on the assessment of the potential impacts of perturbations and
on the target measures needed to reduce them. Compared to the
concepts of stability and robustness, vulnerability appears to be
a broader concept that encompasses the biotechnical and social
factors of agricultural systems. It benefits from an operational
framework that simplifies its use in various agricultural con-
texts, including institutional, social and financial determinants.
3.4 The concept of resilience
The word resilience comes from the Latin resilio, meaning to
rebound. Resilience was originally used in material and psy-
chology sciences to describe the resistance of materials to
physical shocks (Winson 1932) and the ability of individuals
to cope with adversity, trauma or other significant sources of
stress (Murphy 1974), respectively. In ecology, Holling
(1973) popularized this term by defining the resilience of eco-
logical systems as a measure of their persistence when
confronted by unpredictable perturbations and of their ability
to absorb change. Subsequently, the concept of resilience has
been increasingly adopted as a generic approach to describe
social-ecological systems as complex entities which are con-
tinually transforming themselves through cycles of change
(Carpenter et al. 2001; Folke et al. 2010; Holling 2005).
Based on extensive literature from various scientific back-
grounds, resilience has been variously characterized as a
loosely organized cluster of concepts (Carpenter and Brock
2008), a collection of ideas (Anderies et al. 2006) or a way
of enabling exchanges across disciplines (Brand and Jax
2007). A first part of this literature mainly focuses on the
“specific” meaning of resilience and is relatively close to the
concepts of robustness and vulnerability. In such cases, resis-
tance to perturbations and rate of recovery after their
Agron. Sustain. Dev. (2016) 36: 15

15
occurrence are considered as key aspects of resilience
(Holling 1996). Specific resilience has been used, for exam-
ple, on vegetative systems to study the rate of recovery after a
fire (Lavorel 1999) or other natural hazards (MacGillivray and
Grime 1995). Accordingly, it has been discussed for particular
aspect of socio-ecological systems and for well-characterized
perturbations, such as storms, earthquakes, floods and fires,
for which existing knowledge provides a basis for building
specified resilience (Carpenter et al. 2012). Another part of
recent literature was more oriented towards the “general”
meaning of resilience, i.e. the capacity of socio-ecological
systems to adapt and transform in response to unfamiliar, un-
expected and extreme shocks (Holling 2005). In such papers,
general resilience is studied through the way that socio-
ecological systems persist and innovate when facing unknown
perturbations (Walker and Salt 2006). This second aspect of
resilience is more difficult to apprehend because it refers to
potential changes outside the scope of experience. For exam-
ple, it has been used to study how socio-ecological systems
are transforming themselves in order to continue to achieve
specific goals, to better anticipate critical transitions in the
future (Scheffer et al. 2012) and improve conservation plans
(Standish et al. 2014).
Resilience thinking, referring both to specific and general
aspects of resilience, has been applied to a wide variety of
social-ecological systems, such as everglades (Gunderson
et al. 2002), marine ecosystems (Mumby et al. 2014) and
forests (Parrott and Meyer 2012) but less frequently to agri-
cultural systems. This might be explained by marked differ-
ences between agricultural and other socio-ecological sys-
tems, such as a smaller spatial scale, a high controllability of
the ecological structure and processes on the farm by human
activities, and the strong influence of economic drivers to
ensure both the short-term and long-term economic survival
of agricultural systems (Darnhofer 2010). Moreover, despite
some extreme examples such as the Dust Bowl period in the
1930s in North America, after which farmers fundamentally
changed their practices and adopted planting and plowing
methods that ensured a better conservation of the soil, critical
transformations of agricultural systems are not easy to ana-
lyze, particularly over short time periods.
Nevertheless, despite these differences, the resilience con-
cept has recently been applied to several studies dealing with
the behaviour of agricultural systems facing various kinds of
perturbation. Reflecting the contrasting understandings of this
concept, the resilience of agricultural systems has been used in
several ways: sometimes to measure the degree of resistance
to shock in the face of economic (Abson et al. 2013) or cli-
matic perturbations (Keil et al. 2008), but more frequently as
the ability of agricultural systems to preserve their intrinsic
functions through flexibility (Astigarraga and Ingrand 2011;
Carlisle 2014) and plasticity (Rodriguez et al. 2011). In these
cases, resilience is mainly used to discuss the factors that build
the ability of agricultural systems to respond to changes, to
reorganize their structure, to anticipate future changes and to
take advantage of new opportunities (Folke et al. 2002).
Resilience is probably the broadest concept among the four
discussed in this paper. Applied to agricultural systems, it ap-
pears to be a heuristic framework that is most relevant on a
long-term basis in order to describe and understand farm trans-
formations over periods of time marked by significant eco-
nomic, environmental or sanitary crises (van der Leeuw and
Aschan-Leygonie 2000). It embeds both a timescale approach
and a recovery process (Fig. 2d). Hence, contrary to the con-
cept of vulnerability which focuses on the direct impacts of
specific perturbations on a given feature of the system, the
resilience concept mostly focuses on the consequences of one
to several perturbations, including unpredictable ones, on the
overall trajectory of the system (Mathevet and Bousquet 2014).
4 From concepts to assessment in agricultural
systems
Based on review literature concerning stability, robustness,
vulnerability and resilience, it appears that the research com-
munity has produced an insightful and extensive literature in
recent years to describe and understand better the behaviour of
various systems, including agricultural systems, in a context
of unpredictable change. However, operationalization of these
concepts into empirical assessments remains limited due to
their multidimensional nature and because they are not direct-
ly observable phenomena (Callo-Concha and Ewert 2014).
The situation is even more complicated when assessments
are extended from time-limited events, such as drought, to
gradual perturbations such as climate change. Hence, there is
an urgent need to have a better knowledge of the models and
metrics available to quantify the ability of agricultural systems
to cope with various types of perturbation.
In this section, we review existing approaches that have
been used in empirical studies to quantify the stability, robust-
ness, vulnerability and resilience of agricultural systems.
These approaches are classified in three categories according
to the system level at which they were used: (i) approaches
focusing on the variability of agricultural outputs regardless of
the context of perturbations, (ii) approaches focusing on the
relationship between agricultural outputs and perturbations
and (iii) approaches including a broader scale and taking into
consideration the adaptive capacity of agricultural systems.
We illustrate and discuss these different approaches through
the description of some case studies.
4.1 Variability of agricultural outputs
The first approach, and probably the simplest one, quantifies
the ability of agricultural systems to cope with a changeable
15

Agron. Sustain. Dev. (2016) 36: 15
environment by characterizing agricultural outputs and their
variability across large environmental (time, space, manage-
ment practices) series. This approach has been used in various
studies and can be carried out using different statistical
methods. A first method is to quantify the statistical deviation
of agricultural outputs from the average or median and can be
undertaken using common indices of statistical dispersal (e.g.
standard deviation, coefficient of variation, interquartile
range). For example, Abson et al. (2013) used the coefficient
of variation of economic returns to study the impact of land-
scape diversity on economic “resilience” in the UK between
1996 and 2010.
Other methods focus more on the behaviour of agricultural
systems facing rare but extreme perturbations. These methods
are mainly used in risk assessment studies (Iglesias and Quiroga
2007; Luo et al. 2009) and are usually based on the analysis of
output anomaly distribution. For example, Cernay et al. (2015)
analyzed the yield anomaly distribution of diverse grain le-
gumes over the period 1961–2013 in order to compare variabil-
ity in legume yields across Europe and the Americas. More
precisely, they used value at 10th percentile risk as a measure
to assess in which countries legume yield losses have been the
largest over this period. Lastly, other methods focus on the
probability of achieving farmers’ goals and can be measured
as the probability that agricultural outputs remain above a
certain threshold. For example, Sabatier et al. (2015) used a
stochastic model of grassland dynamics to measure, for various
grazing strategies, the likelihood of fulfilling the feeding re-
quirements of grazing animals. They quantified it as the per-
centage of weather sequences for which the grass resource was
sufficient to feed the herd present on the grasslands every day.
Finally, this first approach is relatively close to the stability
concept because it does not explicitly characterize and take
into account the intensity and variability of perturbations that
affect agricultural systems. It only describes a part of the abil-
ity to cope with an environment subject to perturbations, and it
does not deal satisfactorily with the ability of agricultural sys-
tems to resist and adapt to specific perturbations.
4.2 Relationship between agricultural outputs
and perturbations
This second approach focuses on the response of agricultural
systems to specific perturbations and has been used in various
studies, referring both to robustness (Mosnier et al. 2009) and
vulnerability frameworks (Simelton et al. 2009). More pre-
cisely, this approach is associated with the notion of resistance
that is frequently used in those two frameworks to refer to a
low sensitivity of agricultural outputs to environmental system
conditions. As a result, resistance is measured with respect to
specific perturbations affecting agricultural systems. Indeed,
this approach requires the characterization and quantification
of the intensity of perturbations that affect agricultural systems
(Li et al. 2009; Wu and Wilhite 2004). For example, Simelton
et al. (2009) measured a drought index to assess the resistance
of agricultural production in China to water deficit. The
drought index was quantified as a negative rainfall anomaly,
i.e. by the ratio between average amount of rainfall between
1960 and 2011 and the actual amount of rainfall for each year.
In livestock systems, perturbations can refer to changes in
environmental conditions. For example, the variation in the
herd environment of dairy cows (Windig et al. 2006) and
breeding sows (Herrero-Medrano et al. 2015) has also been
studied to measure the resistance of these livestock systems to
changes in environmental conditions.
Once perturbations have been characterized and quantified,
the resistance of agricultural outputs to changes in environ-
mental conditions is usually assessed through regression
methods. This method has been used by various authors to
study the relationship between agricultural outputs and pertur-
bations which are highly correlated, such as yield and drought
(Luers et al. 2003) or farmers’ income and price volatility. For
example, Mosnier et al. (2009) studied the sensitivity of
farmers’ incomes to climatic and economic perturbations in
France on a panel of 55 farms. Using multiple linear regres-
sions, they identified the influence of stocking rates and length
of production cycles on the sensitivity of livestock systems to
weather and beef price variation. In Nicaragua, Holt-Giménez
(2002) has studied the resistance of more than 800 farmers
after Hurricane Mitch. He discriminated “conventional” and
“agroecological” farms in order to study, under different levels
of storm intensity, the differences of response on several indi-
cators (e.g. erosion or economic returns). He showed that pat-
terns of resistance are not easy to describe and include com-
plex interactions and thresholds. However, the differences in
favour of agroecological plots tended to increase with increas-
ing levels of storm intensity, increasing slope and increasing
years under agroecological practices.
Despite its potential to assess quantitatively the response of
agricultural outputs to specific changes in the system environ-
ment, this approach remains limited to biotechnical compo-
nents of agricultural systems. In particular, social components,
including adaptive capacity, of agricultural systems are diffi-
cult to consider in this approach.
4.3 Multiscale and adaptive capacity assessment
of agricultural systems
In order to integrate the different components of agricultural
systems, a third approach is frequently used. Contrary to the
two previous ones, this approach focuses on the description of
internal system features through a set of proxy indicators more
than on the variability or resistance of agricultural outputs.
This indicator-based approach is applicable to multiple scales
and can include the adaptive capacity of agricultural systems
(Darnhofer et al. 2010). Consequently, this approach has
Agron. Sustain. Dev. (2016) 36: 15
Page 9 of 15
15
mostly been used for assessing and measuring vulnerability
(Gbetibouo et al. 2010) and resilience (Quinlan et al. 2015) of
agricultural systems rather than their stability or robustness.
In this approach, indicators are generally chosen to de-
scribe key aspects of biotechnical and social components
that are supposed to increase or decrease the ability of
agricultural systems to cope with various perturbations. For
example, Cabell and Oelofse (2012) compiled 13 behaviour-
based indicators which cover different properties of agricul-
tural systems, such as spatial and temporal heterogeneity
across landscapes and the human resources available on
farms. Systems in which these 13 indicators are positively
evaluated are supposed to better resist and adapt to
perturbations, while a negative evaluation of these indicators
points to a need for intervention. Based on the vulnerability
framework, Wiréhn et al. (2015) reviewed indicators of expo-
sure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity. The latter ones describe
socio-economic factors that can assist agricultural systems to
adapt and rebound better after perturbations (e.g. farm income,
farm size, crop diversification). Altieri et al. (2015) used indi-
cators of soil conservation practices, crop diversity and food
self-sufficiency to describe the adaptive capacity of various
agroecological farms in Latin America. These indicators are
frequently aggregated and their results displayed in geograph-
ic representations to improve the identification of the most
vulnerable, or less resilient, areas within a territory (O’Brien
et al. 2004; Wilhelmi and Wilhite 2002). This indicator based-
approach has proven to be valuable for monitoring trends but,
as reported by Wiréhn et al. (2015), is limited in its applica-
bility by considerable subjectivity in the selection of variables
and their relative weights and by the difficulty of testing and
validating the different metrics.
To conclude this section, it appears that various approaches
are available to study the behaviour of agricultural systems in
a more changeable environment. Despite their differences,
these approaches can provide additional details and improve
visibility of what improves the ability of agricultural systems
to cope with unpredictable changes. In particular, they can
provide complementary findings at different scales. In the next
section, we review the main elements that emerge from re-
searches completed to date.
5 Key levers for improving the ability of agricultural
systems to cope with perturbations
Based on previous sections, it appears that various concepts
and methods have been mobilized in recent years to charac-
terize and quantify the ability of agricultural systems to cope
with a changeable environment. Despite fuzzy boundaries,
these concepts have specific historical backgrounds and have
been applied to describe different features and behaviours of
agricultural systems.
Based on literature focusing on conceptual definitions and
empirical assessments in agricultural studies, some key levers
are emerging as important properties for a transition towards
more stable, more robust, less vulnerable or more resilient ag-
ricultural systems. These generic elements are summarized in
two categories: first, increasing the intrinsic diversity of agri-
cultural systems and, second, increasing their adaptive capacity.
5.1 Increasing diversity at different levels
Based on recent literature, many authors have emphasized the
potential of increasing diversity in its various forms to im-
prove the behaviour of agricultural systems when facing var-
ious perturbations (Altieri et al. 2015; Lin 2011; Naylor 2008;
Østergård et al. 2009). This assumption relies on the hypoth-
esis that implementing more diversity at different levels pro-
vides greater functional redundancy, i.e. system components
and organization with overlapping functions to buffer year-to-
year changes. However, diversification can be implemented in
a variety of forms and at a variety of scales, allowing farmers
to choose a strategy that both increases their ability to cope
with perturbations and provides economic benefits Lin (2011).
Among biological components, increasing genetic diversi-
ty through cultivars and animal breeds characterized by dif-
ferent agronomic features (e.g. diversity in earliness for culti-
vars; diversity in disease resistance for animal breeds) is sup-
posed to spread the risks of failure by reducing the overall
exposure to perturbations (Di Falco and Perrings 2003;
Tooker and Frank 2012). Increasing breeding of cultivars
and animals with distinctive traits is therefore becoming a
research priority to allow farmers to choose biological com-
ponents adapted to various contexts and perturbations
(Casadebaig et al. 2014; Knap 2005). Similarly, increasing
diversity at the species level by using crops characterized by
different exposure periods and sensitivity features allows the
spreading of risks through the entire cropping rotation (Lin
2011). Following seminal work by Hector et al. (1999),
Tilman et al. (2006) showed that greater complementary and
functional diversity among grassland species were able to sta-
bilize annual plant production. As reported by Huyghe et al.
(2014), the use of mixtures of grasses and legumes has been
largely implemented in grasslands worldwide.
Increasing diversity is also feasible by changing the nature
of crop rotations and introducing perennial tree crops into
annual cropping systems. Based on complementarities be-
tween annual crops and trees, agroforestry systems are char-
acterized by a strong structural complexity (Jose 2009). These
systems have demonstrated their capacity to provide a better
protection for annual crops not only from habitual climatic
perturbations (changes in temperature and precipitation), but
also from extreme perturbations such as hurricanes (Lin
2011). At a larger scale, increasing diversity through regional
landscape diversity is also a strategy for minimizing the
15

impacts of perturbations on agricultural systems: Reidsma and
Ewert (2008) showed that diversity in farm size and intensity
(e.g. cultivar choice, fertilizer and pesticide use) reduces the
regional vulnerability of wheat production to climate change.
Abson et al. (2013) also found that land use diversification in
the UK was positively correlated with the resilience of agri-
cultural returns in the face of uncertain market and environ-
mental conditions. Furthermore, preserving or increasing the
diversity of agricultural systems can also maintain or stimulate
various resources (technology, information and knowledge) at
the territorial level that can be used by farmers in order to cope
with current or future challenges (Nelson et al. 2007). In that
sense, increasing diversity of agricultural systems can also
improve their adaptive capacity.
5.2 Increasing the adaptive capacity of agricultural
systems
Cited mainly in robustness, vulnerability and resilience litera-
ture, adaptive capacity refers to the ability of agricultural sys-
tems to transform their nature or structure to cope with an
ever-changing environment (Milestad et al. 2012). It focuses
on ensuring sufficient room for manoeuvre, identifying tran-
sition capabilities and extending the degrees of freedom of
agricultural systems. More often emphasized in livestock than
in cropping systems (Blanc et al. 2010), adaptive capacity can
be improved at different levels and in biological, technical and
organizational components.
Applied to biological components, adaptive capacity has
been widely discussed in robustness literature as a key breed-
ing goal for animal breeding (Knap 2005). It refers to the
ability of animals to adjust their behaviour to exogenous con-
straints. For example, the adaptive capacity of dairy cows may
refer to their ability to mobilize body reserves during specific
periods in order to support milk production. Blanc et al. (2010)
showed that animals in extensive livestock systems are fre-
quently adjusting their behaviour and physiological responses
to cope with low-feed-intake periods. Such ability to adjust
their behaviour varies between breeds and highlights their abil-
ity to produce and maintain their reproduction in an unstable
environment. Various research programs have focused on in-
creasing these properties in various plants and animals (Knap
2005; ten Napel et al. 2006), but some authors have underlined
a potential trade-off between intrinsic adaptive capacity and the
productivity of livestock systems (Sabatier et al. 2015).
On a larger scale, improving the adaptive capacity of agri-
cultural systems can be based on improvements in the design
of agricultural systems and the implementation of technical
components designed to help farmers to adjust day-to-day
operations. For example, design can rely on the choice of
renewable materials, such as bedding material, feeder type
for livestock and new fertilizers and decision support tools
in crops to prevent abiotic or biotic risks. Several tools are
already available to inform farmers about pest outbreaks, soil
water availability or nitrogen nutrition index, and farmers can
opportunistically respond to variability by adjusting pesticide,
irrigation or fertilizer uses (Mulla 2013). In livestock systems,
increasing adaptive capacity can also refer to organizational
management and to the adaptation in time and space of feed
management to secure feed supply, especially in grassland
systems that can be highly sensitive to drought periods
(Mosnier et al. 2009; Tichit et al. 2004). By introducing more
flexibility in agricultural systems, these technical and decision
making components emerge as important characteristics of
agricultural systems which consciously or automatically ad-
just options to reliable clues from the environment in which
they operate (Rodriguez et al. 2011).
Beyond farm scale, adaptive capacity can also be improved
through collective actions between stakeholders that voluntar-
ily share their goals and production tools. Ireland and
Thomalla (2011) showed that collective action between farms
can promote the establishment of social networks and enhance
the ability of local stakeholders to cope with a changeable
environment. It may also increase their financial resources
which can be used during times of hardship. These new forms
of cooperation between farms are also helping them to estab-
lish new relationships with downstream industries and to
adapt better to changes in market context.
6 Conclusion
The context of increasing uncertainty induces major chal-
lenges for agricultural systems. The need for more sustainable
agricultural systems in an increasingly changeable environ-
ment implies a shift from the aim of maximizing agricultural
outputs in a non-disturbed environment to the aim of main-
taining desired levels of outputs in a context of unpredictable
perturbations. For agronomists, it entails the need for a better
characterization and quantification of the ability of agricultur-
al systems to cope with unpredictable changes. A literature
review of stability, robustness, vulnerability and resilience
highlighted several differences and complementarities be-
tween these four concepts. Depending on the system’s scale,
the type of agricultural output studied and the kind of pertur-
bation, each concept can be meaningful and provide insights
to better characterize agricultural system behaviour in the face
of perturbations. This literature review also provided insights
into the various methods available to quantify these properties
in agricultural systems, from the analysis of the variability and
resistance of agricultural outputs to multiscale and indicator-
based assessments. Based on this literature, increasing diver-
sity and adaptive capacity of agricultural systems emerge as
key drivers for increasing the ability of agricultural systems to
cope with different types of perturbation. However, further
empirical studies are still needed to test and validate these

methods and results in various contexts and across various
spatial and temporal scales. Further research is needed to work
out to what extent and based on which value judgements the
urge for more stable, more robust, less vulnerable or more
resilient agricultural production systems is moving research
towards a course of breeding stable cultivars, towards breed-
ing robust cows, towards protection and exposure avoidance
or towards resilience and adaptation. Of particular interest are
the trade-offs involved.

Yu,  Murugesu Sivapalan First published: 17 December 2018 https://doi.org/10.1029/2018WR024088Citations: 55 SECTIONS PDF TOOLS SHARE Abstract Sociohydrology was launched as the science dealing with feedbacks between coupled human and water systems. Much of the early work in sociohydrology involved studies in spatially isolated domains (e.g., river basins) dealing with phenomena that involved emergent patterns in the time domain, with a focus on formulating and testing hypotheses about how they arise. The papers collected in this Special Section “Sociohydrology: Spatial and Temporal Dynamics of Coupled Human-Water Systems” illustrate that the scientific scope of sociohydrology has broadened over the last few years, with a rich diversity of phenomena studied and an expansion of the knowledge foundations and methodologies applied. These Special Section papers now incorporate methodologies and approaches from a wide range of social science disciplines, including anthropology, complex systems, economics, and sociology. The major themes tackled by these papers are understanding (i) water metabolism—the economic use of water; (ii) interactions between humans and droughts; (iii) interactions between humans and floods; and (iv) the role of human institutions, policy, and management. These collected papers provide a foundation for future research that strives to understand how to achieve water resources sustainability (society to water) and reduce the risk of hydrological hazards in society (water to society). Going forward, we suggest that the development of a common sociohydrology framework will be paramount for research development and student training. Additionally, increased engagement with the broader water management communities will enhance sociohydrology understanding and impact. Key Points The foundation of sociohydrology are the many emergent phenomena that arise during the practice of water resources management Sociohydrology studies benefit from the concepts and methodologies drawn from a wide range of natural and social science disciplines Increased engagement with the broader water management communities and the development of common frameworks represent important issues for sociohydrology going forward 1 Introduction The premise of sociohydrology is that our understanding of water systems is incomplete without the explicit inclusion of people (Srinivasan et al., 2016). Understanding and predicting processes in integrated human-water systems are challenging. This is because different disciplines, vocabularies, and perspectives must be synthesized (Troy et al., 2015; Wesselink et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2018). Bringing frameworks, theories, and models from different disciplines together is particularly challenging, as they typically operate at different scales (i.e., household vs. watershed), focus on different outcome variables (i.e., streamflow vs. welfare), and incorporate different scientific principles (i.e., mass balance vs. general equilibrium). Further, methods are grounded in different epistemologies and require distinct sets of prior knowledge for implementation. The papers collected in this Special Section contribute to this ongoing dialogue concerning the synthesis and a broadening of the scope of sociohydrology by showing how concepts and methods from different disciplines can be applied to study coupled human-water systems. In many respects, this is an exciting time for researchers involved in sociohydrology, as this movement toward consolidation and synthesis will likely open up more new avenues for thinking about and studying coupled human-water systems. 1.1 Sociohydrology to Date Much of the early work on sociohydrology has involved studies in spatially isolated domains (e.g., river basins), focused on phenomena expressed in the form of emergent patterns in the time domain. The analyses involved formulating and testing hypotheses on why these patterns arise. Examples include the levee effect as it applies to flooding in urban environments (Di Baldassarre et al., 2013) and the pendulum swing in water abstractions for human use in agriculture as opposed to water needed by the environment (Kandasamy et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2014). The adopted approach is to frame these systems in terms of system dynamics models involving coupled differential equations that depict the two-way feedbacks between human impacts on hydrology and hydrological impacts on human wellbeing (of some kind) and in this way are able to reproduce or reconstruct the observed emergent patterns. The key advance in these early modeling studies was the introduction of a social variable that reflected the mediating role played by human society in the two-way feedbacks. In the case of the levee effect, this was a social memory of floods (Di Baldassarre et al., 2015), and in the case of the pendulum swing, it took the form of environmental awareness (van Emmerik et al., 2014) or community sensitivity to the environment (Elshafei et al., 2014). Subsequent work has helped to broaden the theoretical foundations of sociohydrology. For example, Sivapalan and Blöschl (2015) helped to frame sociohydrology in the context of co-evolution of human and water systems (in the time domain), with explicit inclusion (i.e., endogenization) of human agency in the form of changing human norms and values and more generally culture. They proposed a study approach of emergent phenomena based on narratives, causal loops, and the development and testing of models using available time series data. This opened the way for a diversity of studies organized by process sociohydrology, historical sociohydrology, and comparative sociohydrology. It was envisaged that a plurality of studies would thus be undertaken in a variety of contexts. The early place-based studies (in the temporal domain) were also accompanied by several commentaries and critiques that sought to broaden the scope and foundations of sociohydrology. There was criticism that much of the early work was dominated by hydrologists, using mostly hydrological (or natural science) methods, and that sociohydrology can benefit from tools and methodologies found in socioecological systems and complex systems literatures (Blair & Buytaert, 2016; Troy et al., 2015). There were also critiques that warned that the field was moving toward theoretical studies divorced from real places involving real people. It was argued that instead of inferring the nature of human-water system feedbacks from historical (time series) data, these can also be obtained through field studies, through surveys, and other forms of data collection, with the goal of understanding human behaviors at a fundamental, empirical level (Mostert, 2018). There were calls for place-based studies in real places, with a greater involvement of social scientists in sociohydrological studies so as to expand the foundations of sociohydrology (Wesselink et al., 2016; Xu et al., 2018). Human-water systems occur at multiple spatial scales and operate in time (Sivapalan et al., 2014). As such, sociohydrological phenomena arise not just in the time domain but they can also arise in the space domain or in space-time (Chen et al., 2016). Pande and Sivapalan (2017) argued that the endogenization of human agency in terms of changing human norms and values must be extended to space and to space-time, as demonstrated already by Chen et al. (2016), since this is an essential prerequisite for water sustainability. Along the same lines, Konar et al. (2016) made the case for a broadening of the scope of sociohydrology toward the regional and global scales. They argued that sociohydrology extended to the global scale can serve as the blueprint to track both water withdrawal and consumption (which may be different in a globalized world), which helps toward the assignment of responsibility for the stewardship of water resources and the advancement of global water sustainability. The growth of the field of sociohydrology is also accompanied by calls for consolidation and synthesis that might lead to more general frameworks that would apply to a wide range of problems. This requires that sociohydrological studies be framed in the context of broad theoretical frameworks, such as water security and resilience. This would bring sociohydrology more aligned to and as a special case of older frameworks such as socioecological systems and thus benefit from the broad literature in coupled human-nature systems. The need for such generalization has long been felt, going all the way back to the very inception of the field (Srinivasan et al., 2012). There have been several recent commentaries proposing alternative frameworks to bring about such synthesis and generalization (Srinivasan et al., 2017; Lu et al., 2018; Sanderson, 2018). 2 Contributions of the Papers in the Special Section on Sociohydrology The last 6 years have been a period of rapid growth of the field, partly in response to these commentaries and critiques. This special section brings together more than 30 papers that reflect significant advances in our understanding of coupled human-water systems. In particular, they reflect a broadening of the scope of sociohydrology, not only in terms of the type of studies undertaken but also in terms of the disciplines involved. A wide range of methodologies is represented in this collection of papers, including the use of systems dynamics and agent-based models, multiple regression analyses, and field surveys. This indicates a certain broadening and maturing of sociohydrology, as also evidenced by a recent assessment of the co-authorship network in sociohydrology (Figure 1). In this section, we present a summary of the 31 papers appearing in this special section, organized under four categories: (i) water metabolism—the economic use of water; (ii) interactions between humans and droughts; (iii) interactions between humans and floods; and (iv) the role of human institutions, policy, and management. This is followed by perspectives on the way forward, guided by previous commentaries and conclusions drawn by the studies appearing in this Special Section.

The papers in this special issue elucidate the important role that water plays in our society across a range of scales. At the smallest spatial scale, several papers evaluate the decision making of individual water users (Kuil et al., 2018; Mason et al., 2018). This grows in scale to papers that focus on urban water use (Chini et al., 2017; Worland et al., 2018) and to papers that explore water use at the national scale (Dadson et al., 2017; Dang & Konar, 2018). These papers highlight that the issue of scaling that has been the focus of much research in physical hydrology (e.g., Blöschl & Sivapalan, 1995) will continue to be an issue to consider in sociohydrology research. In addition to natural watershed boundaries, sociohydrology research must explicitly account for political boundaries. Mason et al. (2018) examine how hydroclimatic variability impacts the decision making of water supply operators. They incorporate a concept from cognitive psychology—the “availability bias”—into their modeling framework. Model results compare well with synthetic reservoir operation data for flood control and water supply. Their model successfully captures the operator's preference selection across objectives and the dynamic evolution of extreme wet and dry situations. Kuil et al. (2018) present a sociohydrological model that captures a farmer's crop choice and water allocation given his/her perception of water availability. They find that different farmer perceptions may lead to different crop patterns but also that similar, near-optimal crop patterns can emerge. The framework is consistent with the theory of bounded rationality, which assumes humans with limited cognitive abilities and imperfect information adopt satisficing behavior. The model by Kuil et al. (2018) also captures the rebound effect; that is, as crop water efficiencies improve, the newly available water will be reallocated on the farm instead of flowing downstream, since farmers will adjust their behavior to take advantage of the new water conditions. Worland et al. (2018) explore the drivers of municipal water use in the United States. Their results indicate that the most important explanatory variables are average precipitation, number of people per household, partisan voting, water price, and regional price parity. However, they find that the environmental, economic, and social controls on water use are not uniform across the country. Counties in the Northeast and Northwest climate regions are more sensitive to social variables, whereas counties in the Southwest and East North Central climate regions are more sensitive to environmental variables. This statistical analysis helps us to understand the current drivers of water use in cities of the United States and make better predictions about future water use trajectories. Chini et al. (2017) quantify the direct and indirect water use of urban areas in the United States. Their values could be used to inform future efforts to benchmark the use of energy and water resources in urban areas. In fact, they show that conservation opportunities exist for water and energy resources in both the direct and indirect supply chains of cities. Water embedded in the food supply chain of cities is the dominant indirect use of water and may represent a future opportunity to reduce the consumption water footprint of cities. Dang and Konar (2018) show that trade leads to lower national water use. To do this, they employ causal inference methods to determine that trade does not impact the total or industrial water use of nations but that it does reduce the agricultural water use of nations. They find that trade openness reduces water use in agriculture primarily through the intensive margin or producing more crop value per unit of water. Dadson et al. (2017) develop a system dynamics model that combine both the productive and harmful roles of water in the economy. This model shows the link between national wealth, water-related productivity, and losses from water-related hazards. Wealthy countries with minimal water-related hazards likely will not need significant investment in water resources infrastructure. However, wealthy countries that face significant water-related hazards should probably expect to spend a significant fraction of national wealth on water infrastructure. Poor countries with poor water endowments and extreme hydrological variability are most likely to descend into a low-level equilibrium or poverty trap, the location of which is controlled by local social and environmental factors. Their conceptual modeling approach provides important insights for the design of robust policies for investment in water-related productive assets and risk management. 2.2 Interactions Between Water Use and Drought Human activities from land use change and irrigation to dam building and water abstraction alter the propagation of drought through the hydrological cycle (Van Loon et al., 2016). In turn, drought impacts human activities, driving water conservation, shifting withdrawals from surface to groundwater, and prompting creative policy and infrastructure responses (Gonzales & Ajami, 2017; Gonzales et al., 2017; Marston & Konar, 2017; Nelson & Burchfield, 2017). The papers in this Special Section characterize and quantify both drought propagation and response and the influence of climatic and social factors in shaping these processes. Apurv et al. (2017) assess the role of climate characteristics in drought propagation and the interactions of these processes with drought response. They test the impact of seasonality, the phase shift between precipitation and evaporation cycles, and aridity on the relationships between meteorological drought, hydrological drought, and groundwater drought. They find that the relative differences in meteorological and hydrological drought are explained by climate aridity and the timing of precipitation relative to potential evapotranspiration and that low interannual precipitation variability is associated with greater risk of drought resulting in groundwater depletion (Apurv et al., 2017). While Apurv et al. (2017) assess the climatic controls on drought propagation, Nelson and Burchfield (2017), Marston and Konar (2017), Gunda et al. (2018), and O'Keeffe et al. (2018) evaluate the influence of social factors in agricultural systems during drought. Both Nelson and Burchfield (2017) and Marston and Konar (2017) investigate responses to the 2012–2014 drought in California's Central Valley. Nelson and Burchfield (2017) developed a spatiotemporal Bayesian model to assess the effect of water rights structures on agricultural production during drought. They find that watersheds with more senior water rights are associated with higher productivity during drought but that while junior water rights are more likely to fallow, their production is less sensitive to drought. This indicates that junior water rights holders have adapted to periodic reductions in surface water. One way they have adapted is groundwater well construction, confirmed by the work of Marston and Konar (2017). Marston and Konar (2017) investigate how the California drought's agricultural impacts propagated through the global food trade system (see Figure 2). They found that while harvested area was reduced (due to fallowing), the water footprint grew due to rising temperatures and cropping changes. The reduction of harvested area led to reduced food commodity trade from the Central Valley. Surface water transfers also fell during this period, but groundwater transfers nearly doubled, strengthening the relationship between food trade and groundwater depletion.

Maps indicate the percent change in (a) green, (b) surface, and (c) groundwater virtual water transfers. Arrows show the change in the volume of virtual water transfers (m3) and are scaled relative to size. Volumes are provided for the largest links. Red arrows indicate a reduction in virtual water transfers; blue arrows signify an increase. Figure reproduced with permission from Marston and Konar (2017). Gunda et al. (2018) and O'Keeffe et al. (2018) also focus on agricultural systems, investigating water stress response dynamics of an acequia community in New Mexico and farmers in Uttar Pradesh, India. Gunda et al. (2018) couple an acequia model, developed by Turner et al. (2016), to a hydrological model to assess the impact of upstream hydrological changes and downstream demand changes on crop production and migration. A unique feature of their study is that they evaluated the role of mutualism in sustaining the acequia during drought. They model mutualism as a function of community participation, which is in turn shaped by employment effects, parcel size, fallow land percentage, and the addition of newcomers to the community. They find that adaptive measures such as shifting crop selection allows the community to adapt to reductions in streamflow but that downstream pressures to reduce water use lead to decreased agricultural profitability. Parallel to the articles in this issue on flood dynamics (Leong, 2018; Sung et al., 2018; Yu et al., 2017), Gunda et al. (2018) demonstrate the importance of community dynamics in influencing community drought response behavior. O'Keeffe et al. (2018) presents the development, in a bottom-up manner, of a coupled sociohydrological model that captures observed farmer irrigation practices in the State of Uttar Pradesh, India, including two-way feedbacks between environment and farmer behavior. In particular, by including these feedbacks between the behavior of water users, irrigation officials, and agricultural practices, the work highlighted the importance of directly including water user behavior in policy making and operational tools to achieve water and livelihood security. Gonzales and Ajami (2017), Gonzales et al. (2017), and Breyer et al. (2018), in turn, investigate drought responses in urban areas. Gonzales and Ajami (2017) adapt a water demand model from Garcia et al. (2016) to assess the impact of changing scarcity awareness on water demand in three San Francisco area water utilities. The three utilities selected differ by average income, percent residential, and average per capita water use. They find that these socioeconomic factors help explain differences in drought response and postdrought rebound. Similarly, Gonzales et al. (2017) observe that the ease and cost of conservation may vary significantly. This motivates them to introduce a water conservation trading scheme and apply the scheme to utility members of the Bay Area Water Supply and Conservation Agency in California. Under conservation trading, utilities that do not meet their targets may purchase credits, and utilities that exceed targets sell credits in an auction. Gonzales et al. (2017) find that trading can reduce the costs of conservation by 20% and that coordinate decision-making increases the benefits for the utilities. Breyer et al. (2018) ask how water conservation impacts urban hydrological cycle in a study of Austin, Texas. They use multiscalar statistical analysis to demonstrate that the outdoor water conservation policies can cascade upward to the watershed scale or downward to the submunicipal scale. Together these studies highlight the importance of considering both feedbacks from drought to human action and from human response to hydrological cycle. 2.3 Interactions Between Human Actions and Floods An important research topic for human-flood interaction is how human behavior and cultural traits evolve in response to flood events and how the resulting social change leads to shifts in hydrologic components that either mitigate or exacerbate floods (Loucks, 2015). Of special interest is understanding the feedback mechanisms that might explain emergent phenomena arising from human-flood interaction, for example, the levee and adaptation effects (Merz et al., 2015). An influential work in this direction is that of Di Baldassarre et al. (2013). Using a system dynamics model, the authors propose feedback mechanisms that can generate the qualitative patterns of levee and adaptation effects. This work has stimulated much interest and discussions in the field. One salient issue in these discussions is how to model the response of social system to the physical process of flooding. The papers in this theme focus on this linkage to provide alternative and complementary views to the approach used by Di Baldassarre et al. (2013, 2015). Yu et al. (2017) presents a system dynamics model of how an agricultural community mobilizes collective action for levee repair in the face of hydroclimate variability and nonfarm job opportunities. An important concept from the field of political economy is introduced in this work—institutional arrangements (rules and norms) for governing people's collective action (e.g., Ostrom, 1990). Institutional arrangements, which are rules and norms that humans devise to govern their behavior, can play a critical role in reducing uncertainty in complex, uncertain situations (North, 1990). Inclusion of institutional arrangements into sociohydrology modeling helps to unpack underlying processes of social response into (1) rules and norms, (2) behavioral choice toward such institutional arrangements (e.g., abide vs. oppose), and (3) situational factors that influence the decision making (e.g., social memory). Sung et al. (2018) explores how different societal policies on flood control influence long-term trajectories of human-flood interaction. The model by Di Baldassarre et al. (2013) considered only two policies from a myriad of possible ones: green society (no structural flood control) and technological society (raising of levees whenever flooding occurs). Sung et al. (2018) go beyond these two control policies by exploring the effects of several adaptive policies on community maintenance of levees. In doing this, Sung et al. (2018) apply control theory from engineering to conceptualize how a human society learns from flood events and adjusts its flood control policies (Figure 3). The same application was made in the field of social-ecological systems to analyze how a farmer-managed irrigation system dynamically adapts its water distribution and cost-sharing rules through learning by doing (Yu et al., 2016). Figure 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint A generic block diagram control system theory (a) is applied to conceptualize a human-flood system governed by adaptive flood control policy (b). The symbols di and do represent internal problems and external forcing, respectively. The circle C represents comparison between the current system state (current flood protection level) and desired set point (target flood protection level) for computing the error value. Inner-loop process involves control activities that are done to minimize the error. Outer-loop process involves updating of the desired set point. Situational factors such as social memory, community attributes, and climate change can influence the dynamics of such inner- and outer-loop processes in human-flood systems. Adapted from Sung et al. (2018) and Yu et al. (2016). Leong (2018) in this special section provides a more nuanced perspective on the levee and adaptation effects. The author goes beyond the dichotomous view of these two phenomena by arguing that (1) a heavy dependence on structural flood protection measures may not always lead to the levee effect and that (2) little use of structural measures and frequent exposure to flooding may not always lead to the adaptation effect. Leong (2018) exposes these possibilities by collecting and analyzing the narratives of people in several floodplain villages of India. Girons Lopez et al. (2017) and Du et al. (2017) focus on flood warning and evacuation behavior of people. Girons Lopez et al. (2017) developed a conceptual model to examine how the efficiency of flood warning is influenced by social preparedness, which is defined as the knowledge and capacities of a social system to proactively respond to a disaster (United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction, 2009). This work uses social memory of flood risk as a proxy for social preparedness. The model results show that a high social preparedness can affect the efficiency of flood warning system; that is, even if the warning system is inaccurate and the traffic network is congested, a high level of social preparedness can compensate for these weaknesses and mitigate flood-related losses. Du et al. (2017) developed an agent-based model to understand the coupled dynamics of public opinion and flood evacuation processes and how these dynamics are influenced by multiple information sources (global casting of flooding, social media, and observation of neighbors) and transportation system states. A key distinction of this work is reflecting the fact that individuals' evacuation behavior is not only influenced by the flood warnings from emergency managers but also by peer-to-peer communication through social media and observation of neighbors' behavior. The model results show that social media can make evacuation processes more sensitive to changes in flood warning and neighborhood observation. Thompson et al. (2017) in this special section focuses on the link from human modifications of water resources to the physical process of flooding. This work uses a theoretical approach to investigate how the development lowlands affects the flooding of lowland environments and water balance partitioning. The model results show that modifications such as building levees and changing land cover can generate trade-offs among flood occurrence, flood duration, and total evaporation. Finally, MacVean et al. (2018) extended the work of Thompson et al. (2017) to reconstruct the hydrology of the 1850–1920 period for California's Central Valley by synthesizing newly reconstructed time series of precipitation, basin inflows, land use change, and levee construction, using a parsimonious and semidistributed version of the model presented earlier by Thompson et al. (2017). Within the limitations of the reconstructed time series, their detailed analyses with the use of the model suggested that levee construction, rather than land-use change, had the greatest impact on the hydrology and that the decreases in annual delta outflows accelerated after 1920. 2.4 Human Institutions, Policy, and Management of Water Water management is the point at which human systems and water systems intersect, blurring the line between “human/social” systems and “natural” systems. The papers in this theme draw upon sociohydrological frameworks to provide insights into the institutions and decision-making processes that co-evolve with water system process to mutually shape water management. Water management may be informed by models, and traditionally, the focus of these models has been hydrological dynamics. Of growing importance, however, is how to more rigorously incorporate the human element into management of sociohydrological systems. Massuel et al. (2018) argue that traditional approaches to hydrology must become more open, and sensitive, to the human sciences. The social dynamics of human systems should be conceptualized as rigorously as the hydrological dynamics, but crucially, they contend that this will involve taking much more seriously the context-specificity of human systems. Their analysis of the Wadi Merguelil watershed and the downstream Kairouan Plain in central Tunisia shows that a conventional water budget modeling framework was not able to account for the many social factors that influence irrigation withdrawals. Instead, an approach recognizing the key role of cultural values allows researchers to better grasp the qualitative aspects of how humans interpret and make sense of sociohydrological systems. Their approach is skeptical of generalizable knowledge because of the site-specific dynamics that emerge from local interactions and that are contingent upon local cultural values. Because generalization continues to be a goal in sociohydrology, there is a real need to develop empirical frameworks that span time and space, while recognizing the context-specificity of human systems. Sanderson et al. (2017) take a step in this direction. Situated at the individual level, this paper develops a social-psychological model to explain policy choices among citizens in a semiarid agricultural region in the Central U.S. Great Plains. Here, again, values are important. Their analysis reveals how cultural values underlie belief formation and normative support for water management. Their model allows comparisons of culture-based decision-making processes among both farming and nonfarming populations in the watershed. These explicit comparisons enable researchers to identify areas of potential value-based conflict and consensus in water management. Another social aspect receiving greater attention recently is that of social position or, more broadly, the degree of stratification in a social system (Sanderson, 2018). Haeffner et al. (2018) explicitly investigate this question in the northern region of Utah, USA. Using a mixed methods approach involving interviews and surveys, they find that city leaders and the public differ in their concerns about water issues: leaders were more concerned about water infrastructure, and the public was more concerned with water availability and financial costs. Especially noteworthy is the finding that perceptions of water quantity and quantity are not merely shaped by the built structures and natural systems but instead are mediated by social structures—values, norms, beliefs, gender roles, and occupational structures. William et al. (2017) lend further support for the proposition that social position matters for modeling the human component of sociohydrological systems. This paper uses cooperative game theory to evaluate stormwater management approaches in the Gwynn Falls watershed, a highly urbanized watershed in West Baltimore, MD, USA. Among the key findings is that municipal-level regulation results in the largest reductions in pollutant loadings, but, again, context matters. The effectiveness of a regulatory approach depends on many socially contingent factors such as political, financial, and again, the distribution of actors' positions within spatial stormwater networks. Taking the context seriously means considering it as an issue related to the scale of sociohydrological systems. Schifman et al. (2017) propose a framework for sociohydrology that attempts to enhance the adaptability of these systems by optimizing multiple functions and outcomes, including ecosystem services, spanning various institutional scales. They apply the framework to green infrastructure initiatives in Cleveland, OH, USA and Atlanta, GA, USA. The results demonstrate the model's potential utility beyond these cases, while avoiding the pitfalls of a one-size-fits-all approach. Along these lines, Voisin et al. (2017) integrate a regional integrated assessment model with an Earth system model to better understand the effects of sectoral human actions on spatial patterns in water resources, focusing especially on feedbacks between the human and natural systems. The impacts of water management depend on scale, and sectoral human actions influencing groundwater use and water use recycling shape spatial patterns in streamflows and water deficits. Roobavannan et al. (2017) incorporate several of the key elements discussed under this theme. This paper assesses the pendulum swing hypothesis in the Murrumbidgee River Basin in east Australia. Economic diversification emerges as the key variable, reshaping cultural values and norms over time and shifting the balance of preferences away from agricultural production and economic growth toward environmental restoration and sustainability. The paper sheds light on how scale, social structure, cultural values, and water resources interact over time, co-evolving through feedbacks to generate emergent outcomes. Wescoat et al. (2018) use historical geographic and statistical methods to gain context-specific understanding of how and why measurements of water flows have been done in the ways they have in the Indus River Basin of Pakistan. They do their analysis in three levels of water channels: basin, canal, and local distributary levels. The paper demonstrates that the combined use of historical geographic and statistical methods can be a viable approach for conducting sociohydrology research. Treuer et al. (2017) in this special section provides a rich context specific analysis of how urban water utilities can transition toward more sustainable water management practices. Using a case of Miami-Dade County, Florida, they demonstrate that a better understanding of such a transition requires a data-narrative approach that systematically synthesizes quantitative and qualitative data sources, including local knowledge of practitioners and archived documents. Their analysis shows that the alignment of certain biophysical, regulatory, financial, and political conditions likely have contributed to the region's transition toward improved water sustainability. One unique aspect of the study is the use of institutional analysis (analysis of rules and norms) based on government documents to understand regulatory factors influencing such a transition. Finally, Bijl et al. (2018) presented a model for freshwater scarcity assessment that integrated the impacts of future population growth, agricultural production patterns, energy use, economic development, and climate change on the global freshwater cycle. With such integration between hydrology and economy, the model was able to generate greater understanding of the competition dynamics between the different freshwater users and different allocation mechanisms, at the basin and grid scales. In this way, the application of the model enabled broad conclusions to be made about the effects of climate change and variability and water use efficiency improvements in irrigated agriculture on global water withdrawals and deficits. 3 Going Forward The papers in this Special Section employ diverse disciplinary perspectives and methods to advance our understanding of coupled human-water systems. In so doing, they have also contributed to a broadening of the scope and foundations of sociohydrology. However, a few major threads of research remain for the future. Our review of the papers suggests the following questions yet to be addressed: (1) How will people adapt to future water scarcity? (2) How can we better anticipate the hydrological impacts of human activity across scales? (3) What policies or infrastructure investment can best protect communities from flooding and drought? (4) What policies can promote water security and when is unsustainable water use “ok”? (5) How does the socioecological context shape the success or failure of these policies? These questions will be increasingly important to address in our era of global change. Challenges also remain in connecting sociohydrological science to practice, developing generalizable knowledge of coupled human water systems, and training the next generation of practitioners and scholars. 3.1 Connecting Sociohydrology With Practice Increasingly, it will be important for sociohydrology to engage with the broad community of water resources managers. One avenue to potentially accomplish this goal is by explicitly evaluating the uncertainty and sensitivity inherent in the modeling of the sociohydrology system of interest. As in any model, the relevant variables and mechanisms included depend on the research question and scope of the problem. Recent sociohydrology work aims to make all relevant sources of uncertainty explicit in a structured way (Westerberg et al., 2017). This assessment of uncertainty in system outcomes can help to structure dialogue with water resources managers and planners, as well as engage them in the development and process of the research (Westerberg et al., 2017). However, we also recognize that the nature of sociohydrological systems implies a different split between epistemological and aleatory uncertainties than pristine hydrological systems (Srinivasan et al., 2016). Engaging stakeholders in model development through structured dialogue, communication, and understanding about system uncertainty strengthens the research aspects of the model and also better integrates interdisciplinary communities and research with practice (Wesselink et al., 2017). While traditional hydrology or water resources management make predictions of future events based on past observations, sociohydrology addresses the prediction of novel phenomena to understand system dynamics and limits (Levy et al., 2016). Methodologies to account for uncertainty in sociohydrology should respond to the nature of prediction in sociohydrology (Srinivasan et al., 2016), and therefore, uncertainty assessments should focus on the evaluation of model structural adequacy and the ability to reproduce observed patterns and signatures. Sociohydrology and water resources system science are similar in that they consider both water and people and their mutual importance. The key distinction is that while water resources management focuses on how water resources can be better managed to benefit both society and nature by using multidisciplinary and participatory approaches (Kasprzyk et al., 2018), sociohydrology focuses on the complexity and emergent outcomes of human and water interactions (Sivapalan et al., 2012). Water resources management based on the assumptions of static human and water components (thus, insufficient recognition of the complex and adaptive nature of coupled human and water systems) can fail to deliver desired management goals (Vogel et al., 2015). Indeed, many of the phenomena that have been the subject of analysis in sociohydrology, and reviewed here, have arisen in the normal course of water resource management, as failures or unintended consequences (Gohari et al., 2013), due to some long-term feedbacks between humans and water systems not being fully accounted for. Thus, introducing and applying sociohydrology insights into water resources management can potentially be very useful. Similarly, insights from water resources professionals can help research to identify system constraints (in modeling) and real-world problems to tackle, making the research more impactful. This calls for more engagement between the sociohydrology and water resource management communities than has been demonstrated thus far. A parallel has, in fact, occurred in the fields of natural resource management and social-ecological systems research. Realization of the complexity and nonlinearity of interactions between social systems and natural systems that sustain them has challenged conventional natural resource management worldwide and led to the widespread acceptance of the concept of the social-ecological system into the field of natural resource management (Folke, 2006). As sociohydrology rapidly expands in the next few years, we expect to see a similar convergence to take shape between sociohydrology and the field of water resources management. Improvement of water management practices through a broadening to include multiple social, economic, and cultural perspectives, assisted by sociohydrology, takes on added importance in the context of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (United Nations, 2018). 3.2 Developing Generalizable Knowledge of Coupled Human Water Systems Going forward, it is likely that sociohydrology will interface with other nexus issues. Water is at the heart of many grand challenges for society, making it likely that water resources researchers may contribute to the intersection of water and food security, economics, energy, and/or biodiversity (Bierkens, 2015). In fact, a growing number of large-scale hydrologic models have incorporated human impacts on the hydrological cycle in recent decades (Wada et al., 2017). Yet the representation of human activities in hydrological models remains challenging and may prove to be a key opportunity for sociohydrology engagement. Questions also remain as to what features make sociohydrology unique compared to other interdisciplinary approaches and what sociohydrology might learn from these other approaches and vice versa. Further, challenges and opportunities remain in the development of common frameworks and general theories for sociohydrology. Frameworks usually specify a general set of variables, and relationships among them, that a researcher should consider when analyzing a case. A key benefit of a common sociohydrology framework would be that it will allow a structured and consistent comparative analysis of diverse case studies across contexts, thereby facilitating the discovery of generalizable patterns. A general sociohydrology theory can provide generalizable understanding of such patterns by clarifying how different case studies relate to one another in terms of causal processes, especially multilevel and multiscale processes associated with a sociohydrological phenomenon. Although most sociohydrology studies are already based on established theories that explain particular processes (e.g., rainfall runoff and expected utility theory), general theories that provide insights into common system-level aspects and multilevel and multiscale dynamics across different place-based studies are relatively scarce and should be pursued in the future as the field matures. Nevertheless, the papers in this Special Section take some initial steps in this direction. For example, Dadson et al. (2017) present a framework that connects water use and risk into an economics framework. Kuil et al. (2018) applied the theory of bounded rationality to analyze farmer crop choice and water allocation decision making, and Treuer et al. (2017) applied Triple Exposure Theory in their assessment of transitions to sustainable water management. Further, papers (Roobavannan et al., 2017; Yu et al., 2017) in this Special Section test and refine existing hypotheses such as the levee effect and the pendulum swing, contributing to theory development. Early sociohydrology studies focused on system dynamics modeling as the primary methodology. The papers in this Special Section highlight the breadth of methods that can be applied to address sociohydrological questions. Leong (2018) collects stakeholder narratives to illustrate how cases can illustrate aspects of both the levee effect and adaptation effect. Treuer et al. (2016) construct narratives and pair them with quantitative metrics to enable cross case comparison without losing the nuance of case context. Identifying feedback relationships across temporal and spatial scales is key to advancing sociohydrology (Thompson et al., 2013). The complex, hierarchical and co-evolutionary nature of sociohydrological problems requires careful selection and interpretation of data analysis methods. For example, while correlation-based methods (e.g., OLS regression, granger causality, and Bayesian inference) can identify linear couplings and their timescales, they cannot unambiguously identify the direction when relationships are asymmetric (Ruddell & Kumar, 2009). In this issue, the authors apply a range of statistical methods such as structural equation modeling (Breyer et al., 2018), hierarchical Bayesian modeling (Nelson & Burchfield, 2017), and regression with instrumental variables (Dang & Konar, 2018) to address these challenges. While Gunda et al. (2018), Dadson et al. (2017), Sung et al. (2018), and others continue the tradition of applying system dynamics modeling to gain qualitative understanding of system behavior, they advance this approach through their application of human system dynamics. One critique of system dynamics approach in sociohydrology is that the diversity of actors is not accounted for. Du et al. (2017) address this challenge by developing an agent-based model of flood warning and evacuation behavior. Collectively, the articles in this issue demonstrate the potential to synthesize multiple methods to increase the robustness of sociohydrological findings—critical to applying insights in practice. However, to address societal challenges, scientific findings must be salient as well as robust. Codevelopment of research aims and coproduction of research products can be an effective way to increase research salience but also introduce new challenges (Tidwell & Van Den Brink, 2008; MacKenzie et al., 2012). Multiple papers in this special issue solicit stakeholder input as data or use stakeholder feedback to refine analyses (e.g., Gunda et al., 2018; Leong, 2018; Treuer et al., 2017). While past sociohydrology work has addressed knowledge transfer (e.g., Gober et al., 2014), no papers in this issue focus on knowledge transfer or research codevelopment, and more work remains to ensure that research efforts in sociohydrology can be applied in practice. Additionally, proper characterization of the uncertainties and sensitivities that exist in sociohydrology models must be explored to inform stakeholders. In this way, policymakers can be engaged to manage uncertainty—rather than reduce it—in a sociohydrology system (Gober et al., 2017). 3.3 Training the Next Generation of Practitioners and Scholars Future education and training of scholars and practitioners equipped to tackle outstanding questions in this field will be critical. A key question for the field is to determine if the training of researchers should shift or broaden to tackle sociohydrological challenges or if the training should emphasize teamwork and communication skills to facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration. Another key question is the relationship between sociohydrology and water resource managers. As sociohydrology is an emerging science, it will engage more directly with water managers—as stakeholders, along with the general public—as it develops. Indeed, these interactions will be necessary in order to incorporate insights from managers and “ground truth” sociohydrological models. Tackling sociohydrological challenges will require knowledge of water resources science as well as the social sciences, with the precise skill sets varying by the scientific questions pursued. A key question for mentors and advisers is to what degree individual researchers should be trained in this skill set versus preparing researchers to collaborate across disciplines. However, a core body of knowledge will remain essential so that scholars can interface and communicate with one other easily. Programs of study will grapple with what this fundamental body of knowledge is and should be. We suggest that several strategic skills to develop include methods in data science, complex systems science, coupled human and natural systems modeling, and causal inference. Going forward, science communication training will be an increasingly important skill set to develop, since this will enable work across disciplines, with policymakers, water managers, and the broader public.

A systematic review of automated systems for real-time irrigation management

1. INTRODUCTION
The challenge of feeding a growing population with finite resources is becoming increasingly pressing. By 2050, the world population is expected to reach 9.7 billion, necessitating a 70% increase in food production (Falkenmark and Rockstrom, 2009). Irrigation plays a crucial role in enhancing crop yields and agricultural productivity to meet this growing demand. Studies have shown that irrigation can significantly increase crop water productivity, contributing to increased food production (Ali and Talukder, 2008; Playan and Mateos, 2005). However, water scarcity poses a significant challenge, with many regions facing water deficits and the need for improved water management practices (Falkenmark and Rockstrom, 2009). Optimizing irrigation schedules and doses based on crop requirements and environmental conditions is essential for maximizing yield and quality while minimizing water use (Zhang et al., 2024). The necessity of scalable water-efficient practices for increasing food demand cannot be overstated. Techniques such as regulated deficit irrigation, magnetically treated water, and the use of drought-tolerant crops like sorghum have shown promise in improving water productivity and ensuring food security (Mehmood et al., 2023; Putti et al., 2023; Hadebe et al., 2016). As the global food challenge intensifies, it is imperative to critically evaluate the current state and future potential of irrigation management systems to guide research, innovation, and implementation efforts towards fully autonomous, scalable solutions.

Despite the importance of irrigation in addressing the global food challenge, traditional irrigation management techniques, such as manual scheduling and timer-based systems, have significant limitations. These methods are often labor-intensive, inefficient, and less adaptable to changing conditions (Savin et al., 2023). Manual and timer-based scheduling can lead to high operational costs and inefficient water use (Raghavendra, Han, and Shin, 2023). The reliance on manual intervention and predetermined schedules limits their adaptability to changing environmental conditions, crop water requirements, and soil moisture levels (Kaptein et al., 2019). Sensor-based irrigation systems offer an alternative, enabling real-time adjustments based on soil water status measurements (Kaptein et al., 2019). However, the adoption of these systems in commercial settings has been limited, often requiring extensive input from researchers (Kim et al., 2014; Lea-Cox et al., 2018; Ristvey et al., 2018). The limitations of traditional irrigation management techniques highlight the need for scalable, automated solutions for greater efficiency in irrigation management. Automated systems that collect real-time data, analyze it, and make autonomous irrigation decisions can lead to improved water use efficiency and increased crop productivity (Champness et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2022). To fully understand the potential of automated systems, it is necessary to examine the automation of each part of the irrigation management pipeline and analyze the effectiveness and efficiency of integrated end-to-end solutions.

The emergence of smart irrigation management and IoT marks a significant shift from historical irrigation practices. Modern approaches rely on vast data and analysis algorithms, leveraging technologies such as remote sensing, sensor networks, weather data, and computational algorithms (Atanasov, 2023; Bellvert et al., 2023; Kumar et al., 2023). IoT plays a vital role in collecting vast amounts of data through sensors, data transmission, and tailored networks, enabling real-time monitoring and control of irrigation systems (Liakos, 2023; Zuckerman et al., 2024). These advancements in data collection and analysis have the potential to revolutionize irrigation management, allowing for more precise and efficient water use. However, challenges such as processing diverse data sources, data integration, and lack of integrated data analysis hamper the full benefit of IoT in irrigation management (Dave et al., 2023). The current fragmented approach in smart irrigation, focusing on individual components rather than the entire system, limits the potential for fully autonomous, real-time end-to-end irrigation management (Togneri et al., 2021). To address these challenges and fully realize the potential of smart irrigation management, there is a need for automating and integrating each section of the irrigation management pipeline, from sensor/weather data collection and transmission to processing, analysis, decision-making, and automated action (McKinion and Lemmon, 1985). This integration requires a thorough investigation of the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling seamless communication and compatibility between components within the automated irrigation management pipeline.

Machine learning (ML) plays a significant role in processing vast data, predicting plant stress, modeling climate effects, and optimizing irrigation in smart irrigation management systems. ML algorithms can analyze data collected from sensors and weather stations to determine optimal irrigation schedules (Vianny et al., 2022). However, the potential of ML is often constrained by manual steps, such as data interpretation, decision-making on irrigation timing and volume, and system adjustments. Automating ML integration to allow direct action from insights to irrigation execution, removing bottlenecks and achieving real-time adaptability, is crucial for fully autonomous irrigation management (Barzallo-Bertot et al., 2022). By integrating ML into automated systems, the irrigation management pipeline can become more seamless and efficient, enabling real-time decision-making and action based on data-driven insights. To achieve this level of automation and integration, it is essential to identify gaps and propose solutions for seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, aiming to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.

To achieve seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, interoperability and standardization are critical. Interoperability allows different system components, such as sensors, actuators, and software, to communicate and exchange data effectively, while standardization ensures that data is represented in a consistent format (Santos et al., 2020). Standardized protocols and data formats are essential for achieving seamless integration and ensuring compatibility between components in real-time irrigation management systems (Robles et al., 2022; Hatzivasilis et al., 2018). Existing and emerging standards, such as OGC SensorThings API and ISO 11783, have applicability to real-time irrigation management systems (Hazra et al., 2021). However, challenges such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security need to be addressed to fully realize the potential of interoperability and standardization in automated irrigation management systems (Hazra et al., 2021). Addressing these challenges is crucial for enabling the seamless integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline, which is essential for achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. A comprehensive evaluation of the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling the integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline is necessary to guide future research and implementation efforts.
The primary objective of this systematic review is to critically evaluate the current state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies for enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
Specific objectives include:
•	Examining the automation of each part of the irrigation management pipeline and the seamless integration of each section in the context of irrigation scheduling and management.

By addressing these objectives, this systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive and critical evaluation of the current state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems. Its intention is to guide future research, innovation, and implementation efforts to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management that can contribute to addressing the global food challenge.

3. DATA COLLECTION TO CLOUD: AUTOMATION AND REAL-TIME PROCESSING
3.1. Irrigation management data
The success of automated irrigation management systems relies heavily on the collection, transmission, and analysis of various types of data. The most applicable data types for irrigation management include soil moisture, canopy temperature, weather data, and plant physiological parameters (Farooq et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Olivier et al., 2021; Evett et al., 2020). These data are typically collected from a range of sources, including in-field sensors, remote sensing platforms, weather stations, and manual measurements (Li et al., 2019; Karimi et al., 2018).
Soil moisture data is arguably the most critical type of data for irrigation management, as it directly reflects the water available to plants and can be used to determine the optimal timing and amount of irrigation (Olivier et al., 2021; Intrigliolo & Castel, 2006). Soil moisture sensors, such as tensiometers, capacitance probes, and time-domain reflectometry (TDR) sensors, can provide real-time measurements of soil water content at various depths (Farooq et al., 2019). These sensors can be deployed in a network configuration to capture spatial variability in soil moisture across a field (Karimi et al., 2018).
Canopy temperature data is another valuable type of data for irrigation management, as it can be used to assess plant water stress and adjust irrigation accordingly (Evett et al., 2020). Infrared thermometers and thermal cameras can be used to measure canopy temperature, which is influenced by factors such as air temperature, humidity, wind speed, and plant water status (Li et al., 2019). When plants experience water stress, they tend to close their stomata to reduce water loss, leading to an increase in canopy temperature (Evett et al., 2020). By monitoring canopy temperature and comparing it to reference values, automated irrigation systems can detect plant water stress and trigger irrigation events to maintain optimal plant health and productivity (Li et al., 2019).
Weather data, including temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, and solar radiation, are essential for predicting crop water requirements and scheduling irrigation events (Akilan & Baalamurugan, 2024). Weather stations equipped with various sensors can provide real-time measurements of these parameters, which can be used as inputs for crop water requirement models, such as the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith equation (Li et al., 2019). These models estimate crop evapotranspiration (ET) based on weather data and crop-specific coefficients, allowing for the calculation of irrigation requirements (Intrigliolo & Castel, 2006). By integrating weather data into automated irrigation systems, irrigation schedules can be dynamically adjusted based on changing environmental conditions, ensuring that crops receive the optimal amount of water at the right time (Akilan & Baalamurugan, 2024).
When collecting and utilizing these data types, several considerations must be taken into account, including the volume, frequency, format, and source of the data (Farooq et al., 2019). The volume of data generated by automated irrigation systems can be substantial, especially when high-resolution sensors are deployed at a large scale (Bastidas Pacheco et al., 2022). This necessitates the use of efficient data storage, processing, and transmission technologies to handle the data load (Farooq et al., 2019). The frequency of data collection is another important consideration, as it directly impacts the temporal resolution of the data and the ability to detect rapid changes in plant water status or environmental conditions (Bastidas Pacheco et al., 2022). Bastidas Pacheco et al. (2022) demonstrated that collecting full pulse resolution data from water meters provides more accurate estimates of event occurrence, timing, and features compared to aggregated temporal resolutions, highlighting the importance of selecting appropriate data collection frequencies to ensure the quality and usefulness of the data for irrigation management.
The format of the data is also crucial, as it determines the compatibility and interoperability of the data with various analysis tools and platforms (Farooq et al., 2019). Standardized data formats, such as JSON, XML, or CSV, can facilitate data exchange and integration between different components of the automated irrigation system (Zhang et al., 2023). The source of the data is another important consideration, as it can impact the reliability, accuracy, and spatial coverage of the data (Farooq et al., 2019). For example, in-field sensors provide highly localized measurements, while remote sensing platforms, such as satellites or drones, can provide data at larger spatial scales (Li et al., 2019). By combining data from multiple sources, automated irrigation systems can achieve a more comprehensive understanding of crop water requirements and optimize irrigation management accordingly (Farooq et al., 2019).
Data quality, accuracy, and reliability are paramount in irrigation management, as they directly impact the effectiveness of decision-making processes and the efficiency of water use (Gupta et al., 2020). Inaccurate or unreliable data can lead to suboptimal irrigation decisions, resulting in crop stress, yield losses, or wasted water resources (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022). Gupta et al. (2020) emphasized the critical importance of data security and privacy in smart farming systems, as the leakage of sensitive agricultural data can cause severe economic losses to farmers and compromise the integrity of the automated irrigation system. The authors also highlighted the need for robust authentication and secure communication protocols to prevent unauthorized access to smart farming systems and protect data in transit (Gupta et al., 2020).
Ramli and Jabbar (2022) addressed the challenges associated with implementing real-time, automated irrigation systems, including data quality, scalability, reliability, and security. They proposed solutions and best practices based on the analysis of case studies and real-world implementations, such as the use of redundant sensors, data validation techniques, and secure communication protocols (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022). The authors also emphasized the importance of regular maintenance and calibration of sensors to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the collected data (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022).
Researchers have investigated the use of data compression, aggregation, and filtering techniques to reduce bandwidth requirements and improve transmission efficiency in automated irrigation systems (Karim et al., 2023; Rady et al., 2020; Cui, 2023). Karim et al. (2023) explored the effectiveness of various data compression techniques, such as lossless and lossy compression algorithms, in reducing the size of data packets transmitted over wireless networks. The authors found that lossless compression techniques, such as Huffman coding and Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW), can significantly reduce data size without compromising data quality, while lossy compression techniques, such as JPEG and MP3, can further reduce data size by introducing acceptable levels of distortion (Karim et al., 2023).
Rady et al. (2020) developed a novel data compression algorithm specifically designed for irrigation data, which achieved significant compression ratios without compromising data quality. The authors demonstrated that their algorithm could reduce the amount of data transmitted over wireless networks, thereby improving the efficiency of the irrigation system and reducing costs (Rady et al., 2020). Cui (2023) investigated the use of data aggregation and filtering techniques to reduce the number of transmissions and save bandwidth in automated irrigation systems. The author proposed a data aggregation scheme that combines multiple sensor readings into a single value, such as the average soil moisture over a specified time interval, to reduce the frequency of data transmissions (Cui, 2023). Additionally, the author explored the use of data filtering techniques, such as Kalman filters and particle filters, to remove noise and outliers from sensor data, improving the accuracy and reliability of the transmitted information (Cui, 2023).
Data standardization and harmonization are crucial for facilitating seamless integration and interoperability between the various components of automated irrigation management systems (Zhang et al., 2023; Ermoliev et al., 2022). Zhang et al. (2023) developed a novel cyberinformatics technology called iCrop, which enables the in-season monitoring of crop-specific land cover across the contiguous United States. The authors highlighted the importance of data standardization and harmonization in the context of iCrop, as it allows for the efficient distribution of crop-specific land cover information based on the findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data principle (Zhang et al., 2023). By adopting standardized data formats and protocols, such as the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards, iCrop enables the seamless integration of various data sources and facilitates the interoperability of the system with other agricultural decision support tools (Zhang et al., 2023).
Ermoliev et al. (2022) proposed a linkage methodology for linking distributed sectoral/regional optimization models in a situation where private information is not available or cannot be shared by modeling teams. The authors emphasized the need for data standardization to enable decentralized cross-sectoral coordination and analysis, as it allows for the consistent representation and exchange of data between different models and stakeholders (Ermoliev et al., 2022). By adopting standardized data formats and interfaces, the proposed linkage methodology can facilitate the integration of various optimization models and support the development of comprehensive decision support systems for sustainable resource management (Ermoliev et al., 2022).
Metadata plays a vital role in providing context and enabling better data interpretation and decision-making in automated irrigation management systems (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021). Metadata refers to the additional information that describes the characteristics, quality, and context of the primary data, such as the sensor type, calibration parameters, measurement units, and timestamp (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021). Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al. (2021) highlighted the importance of metadata in water resources management, as it enables decision-makers to use the data to the best of its capabilities by understanding factors such as when water data was collected and what factors might have contributed to the measurements. The authors emphasized the need for standardized metadata formats and guidelines, such as the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) and the ISO 19115 standard, to ensure the consistency and interoperability of metadata across different water information systems (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021).
In the context of automated irrigation management systems, metadata can provide valuable information about the data collection process, sensor performance, and environmental conditions that can aid in data interpretation and decision-making (Cota & Mamede, 2023). For example, metadata about the sensor type and calibration parameters can help assess the accuracy and reliability of the collected data, while metadata about the weather conditions and soil properties can provide context for interpreting the data and adjusting irrigation strategies accordingly (Cota & Mamede, 2023). By incorporating metadata into the data management and analysis pipeline of automated irrigation systems, decision-makers can make more informed and context-aware decisions, leading to improved water use efficiency and crop productivity (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021).

3.2. Edge Computing and Fog Computing
Edge computing and fog computing have emerged as transformative technologies in the realm of real-time irrigation management systems, offering significant potential for improving efficiency, scalability, and reliability (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2019). Edge computing refers to the practice of processing data near the edge of the network, close to the source of the data, while fog computing is a decentralized computing infrastructure that extends cloud computing capabilities to the network edge (Hassija et al., 2019). These technologies bring computation and analytics closer to the data source, reducing the need for data to travel to the cloud and enabling faster processing and decision-making (Hassija et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020).
The potential of edge computing and fog computing in real-time irrigation management is immense. Abdel Nasser et al. (2020) proposed a two-layer system for water demand prediction using automated meters and machine learning techniques, demonstrating the potential of edge computing in improving the efficiency and scalability of irrigation management. The system collects and aggregates data from distributed smart meters in the first layer, while the second layer uses LSTM neural networks to predict water demand for different regions of households. By leveraging edge computing, the system can achieve high accuracy in predicting water demand, which is essential for efficient irrigation management (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020).
Tran et al. (2019) conducted a comprehensive review of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems, highlighting the role of fog computing in addressing data transmission challenges and enabling seamless integration across the irrigation management pipeline. The authors emphasize that real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems have the potential to significantly improve water efficiency, crop yields, and reduce labor costs. However, they also identify several challenges that need to be addressed, such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security, which can be effectively tackled by implementing fog computing architectures (Tran et al., 2019).
Edge computing offers several benefits in real-time irrigation management systems, including reduced latency, real-time decision-making, and reduced reliance on cloud connectivity (Mishra, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). By processing data closer to the source, edge computing enables faster response times and more efficient data handling (Mishra, 2020). Mishra (2020) highlights that edge computing reduces latency by processing data closer to the source, enabling real-time decision-making and lessening reliance on cloud connectivity by shifting processing to local or edge devices.
Zhang et al. (2020) explore the application of edge computing in agricultural settings, demonstrating its potential to improve the efficiency and accuracy of irrigation systems. The authors discuss how edge computing has prospects in various agricultural applications, such as pest identification, safety traceability of agricultural products, unmanned agricultural machinery, agricultural technology promotion, and intelligent management. They also emphasize that the emergence of edge computing models, such as fog computing, cloudlet, and mobile edge computing, has transformed the management and operation of farms (Zhang et al., 2020).
Fog computing plays a crucial role in distributing processing and storage across the network, enhancing the scalability and reliability of automated irrigation systems (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022; Singh et al., 2022). Premkumar and Sigappi (2022) evaluate the current state of automated irrigation management systems and propose a hybrid machine learning approach for predicting soil moisture and managing irrigation. Their study emphasizes the potential of fog computing in distributing processing and storage across the network, improving the efficiency and scalability of irrigation systems. The proposed hybrid machine learning approach outperforms other machine learning algorithms in predicting soil moisture, demonstrating the effectiveness of fog computing in enhancing the performance of automated irrigation systems (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022).
Singh et al. (2022) discuss the role of fog computing in distributing processing and storage across the network, enhancing scalability and reliability in agricultural management systems. The authors argue that by implementing fog computing, these systems can achieve faster data processing and response times, improving overall efficiency and effectiveness. They also highlight that fog computing can address the challenges faced by real-time data transmission in agricultural management systems, such as latency, bandwidth limitations, and data security (Singh et al., 2022).
The integration of edge and fog computing in real-time irrigation management systems is crucial for achieving fully automated, scalable, and reliable solutions. As the demand for autonomous irrigation management grows, these technologies will play a pivotal role in enabling faster decision-making, reduced latency, improved resource utilization, and seamless integration across the irrigation management pipeline (Tran et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020). By bringing computation and analytics closer to the data source and distributing processing and storage across the network, edge and fog computing can significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of automated irrigation systems, contributing to the overall goal of addressing the global food challenge through optimized water resource management and increased agricultural productivity (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022; Singh et al., 2022).

3.3. Automation of Data Collection
The automation of data collection is a critical component in the development of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies. It enables the efficient gathering of vital information about crop health, environmental conditions, and water requirements, which is essential for enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity. Two key aspects of automated data collection are the use of advanced sensing technologies for non-invasive plant stress detection and the implementation of wireless sensor networks and energy-efficient communication protocols for large-scale, long-term data collection.
Advanced sensing technologies, such as hyperspectral imaging and thermal sensing, have emerged as powerful tools for non-invasive plant stress detection in automated irrigation management systems. These technologies provide valuable information about crop traits, enabling early and accurate detection of plant health issues (Triantafyllou et al., 2019). Triantafyllou et al. (2019) propose a comprehensive reference architecture model that incorporates advanced sensing technologies in the sensor layer for real-time plant stress detection, highlighting their importance in providing non-invasive plant stress detection. Similarly, Hossain et al. (2023) present a novel IoT-ML-Blockchain integrated framework for smart agricultural management that leverages advanced sensing technologies to optimize water use and improve crop yield, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
Hyperspectral imaging can capture subtle changes in plant physiology that are indicative of stress, while machine learning algorithms can be employed to extract meaningful patterns from the spectral data and classify different stress types (Araus et al., 2014). Thermal sensing can detect changes in canopy temperature, which is influenced by factors such as plant water status (Li et al., 2019). By monitoring canopy temperature and comparing it to reference values, automated irrigation systems can detect plant water stress and trigger irrigation events to maintain optimal plant health and productivity (Li et al., 2019).
The integration of advanced sensing technologies in automated irrigation management systems has the potential to revolutionize precision agriculture. Jiang et al. (2019) demonstrate the effectiveness of a deep learning-based model in accurately detecting leaf spot diseases, highlighting the importance of image augmentation and deep learning algorithms in enhancing the model's performance.
Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and energy-efficient communication protocols have the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and reliability of data collection in large-scale, long-term irrigation systems. WSNs offer a cost-effective and scalable solution for real-time data collection in large-scale irrigation systems, providing remote monitoring and automated control capabilities (Mehdizadeh et al., 2020). Nishiura and Yamamoto (2021) propose a novel sensor network system that utilizes drones and wireless power transfer to autonomously collect environmental data from sensor nodes in vast agricultural fields, reducing operational costs and enhancing the efficiency of data collection. Similarly, Higashiura and Yamamoto (2021) introduce a network system that employs UAVs and LoRa communication to efficiently collect environmental data from sensor nodes distributed across large farmlands, optimizing data collection and reducing travel distance and time.
Energy-efficient communication protocols are crucial for ensuring reliable data transmission in challenging environmental conditions and extending the lifespan of sensor nodes (Mehdizadeh et al., 2020). Al-Ali et al. (2023) investigate the potential of WSNs and energy-efficient communication protocols for data collection in large-scale, long-term irrigation systems, discussing the challenges and opportunities of using these technologies to improve the efficiency and reliability of real-time data collection in irrigation management. Mehdizadeh et al. (2020) emphasize the need for careful consideration of factors such as data accuracy, energy consumption, and network reliability when designing effective WSNs for irrigation management, enabling timely irrigation decisions and improved crop yields.
The automation of data collection through the use of advanced sensing technologies and wireless sensor networks is essential for achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. By enabling non-invasive plant stress detection and large-scale, long-term data collection, these technologies contribute to the overall goal of optimizing water resource management and increasing agricultural productivity. The integration of these technologies in real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems has the potential to enhance agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity, ultimately contributing to the development of fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management solutions.

3.4: Real-Time Data Transmission Protocols and Technologies
Real-time data transmission is a critical component of automated irrigation management systems, as it enables the timely delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of suitable protocols and network architectures is essential for ensuring efficient and reliable data transmission in these systems, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
The Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol has emerged as a popular choice for real-time data transmission in IoT networks, including those used for automated irrigation management. MQTT is a lightweight, publish-subscribe protocol designed for constrained devices and low-bandwidth networks (Author, 2019). Its simplicity and low overhead make it well-suited for IoT applications where data transmission speed and energy efficiency are critical (Saranyadevi et al., 2022). MQTT provides three Quality of Service (QoS) levels, ensuring data reliability in real-time scenarios (Author, 2019). Chen et al. (2020) proposed novel algorithms to improve data exchange efficiency and handle rerouting in MQTT-based IoT networks for automated irrigation management systems. Their TBRouting algorithm efficiently finds the shortest paths for data transmission, while the Rerouting algorithm effectively handles the rerouting of topic-based session flows when a broker crashes. The combination of these algorithms can significantly improve the performance and reliability of automated irrigation management systems (Chen et al., 2020).
Client-server IoT networks, such as those based on MQTT, play a crucial role in real-time data transmission for automated irrigation management systems. In these networks, sensors and devices (clients) publish data to a central broker (server), which then distributes the data to subscribed clients (Verma et al., 2021). This architecture enables efficient data collection, processing, and dissemination, facilitating the integration of various components within the automated irrigation management pipeline. Verma et al. (2021) proposed an architecture for healthcare monitoring systems using IoT and communication protocols, which provides a comprehensive overview of existing approaches and highlights challenges and opportunities in the field. Although focused on healthcare, the insights from this study can be applied to automated irrigation management systems, emphasizing the importance of interoperability and standardization for seamless integration (Verma et al., 2021).
In addition to MQTT, other application layer protocols such as XMPP, CoAP, SOAP, and HTTP have been explored for real-time data transmission in IoT networks. Each protocol has its strengths and weaknesses, making them suitable for different applications and scenarios. XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) is an open-standard protocol that supports real-time messaging, presence, and request-response services (Saint-Andre, 2011). CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) is a specialized web transfer protocol designed for use with constrained nodes and networks in the Internet of Things (Shelby et al., 2014). SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services, while HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web (Fielding et al., 1999).
Motamedi and Villányi (2022) compared and evaluated wireless communication protocols for the implementation of smart irrigation systems in greenhouses, considering factors such as power consumption, range, reliability, and scalability. They found that ZigBee is the most suitable local communication protocol for greenhouse irrigation due to its large number of nodes and long range, while MQTT is the recommended messaging protocol for smart irrigation systems due to its TCP transport protocol and quality of service (QoS) options. GSM is a reliable and cost-effective global communication protocol for greenhouse irrigation, providing wide coverage and low cost (Motamedi & Villányi, 2022).
Syafarinda et al. (2018) investigated the use of the MQTT protocol in a precision agriculture system using a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). They found that MQTT is suitable for use in IoT applications due to its lightweight, simple, and low bandwidth requirements. The average data transmission speed using the MQTT protocol was approximately 1 second, demonstrating its effectiveness for real-time data transmission in precision agriculture systems (Syafarinda et al., 2018).
The choice of application layer protocol for real-time irrigation management depends on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. MQTT and RTPS (Real-Time Publish-Subscribe) are both suitable for real-time data transmission in IoT systems, but they have different strengths and weaknesses. MQTT is a better choice for applications that require low latency and high throughput, while RTPS is a better choice for applications that require high reliability and low latency (Sanchez-Iborra & Skarmeta, 2021). The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of various application layer protocols, provides valuable insights into the suitability of these technologies for real-time data transmission in automated irrigation management systems.
In summary, real-time data transmission protocols and technologies play a vital role in the automation of irrigation management systems, enabling the efficient and reliable delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of application layer protocols, highlights the importance of selecting suitable technologies based on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. By leveraging these technologies, automated irrigation management systems can achieve seamless integration and contribute to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.

3.5. Challenges and Solutions in Real-Time Data Transmission
Following the exploration of data collection, processing at the edge and fog, and automation in previous sections, we now turn to the critical aspect of real-time data transmission. While essential for automated irrigation management, this stage presents unique challenges that must be addressed to ensure system efficiency and reliability.
Obstacles in Real-Time Data Transmission
Agricultural environments present unique challenges for real-time data transmission, directly impacting the effectiveness of automated irrigation systems. Environmental factors can significantly disrupt wireless communication. Adverse weather conditions such as heavy rain, fog, and high winds can weaken or even block radio signals, leading to data loss and compromised system performance. Physical obstacles like trees, buildings, and uneven terrain further complicate signal propagation, creating reliability issues (Jukan et al., 2017; Yi & Ji, 2014; Zhang, Chang & Baoguo, 2018). These environmental challenges necessitate robust communication protocols and network architectures that can ensure consistent and reliable data flow.
In addition to environmental factors, technical limitations also present significant obstacles. Large-scale agricultural operations often demand long-distance data transmission, which can be hindered by the limited range of certain wireless communication protocols. Network congestion, occurring when multiple sensors transmit data concurrently, can lead to delays and potential data loss, further complicating real-time decision-making (Hameed et al., 2020). To mitigate these issues, researchers have investigated the potential of cognitive radio networks (CRNs) and dynamic spectrum access (DSA) for optimizing spectrum utilization and reducing interference (Righi et al., 2017; Shafi et al., 2018; Trigka & Dritsas, 2022). CRNs enable devices to intelligently sense and adapt to the surrounding radio environment, dynamically adjusting transmission parameters to avoid interference and improve communication efficiency. DSA, on the other hand, facilitates the dynamic allocation of unused spectrum, enhancing spectrum utilization and reducing congestion.
Furthermore, data security and privacy are paramount concerns in real-time irrigation systems. The sensitive nature of agricultural data, such as crop yields and farm management practices, necessitates robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches (Gupta et al., 2020). Implementing secure communication protocols, authentication mechanisms, and encryption techniques is essential to protect data integrity and ensure the trustworthiness of the system.
Investigating Data Optimization Techniques
To enhance the efficiency and reliability of real-time data transmission in automated irrigation systems, researchers have explored a range of data optimization techniques. Data compression techniques aim to reduce the size of data packets transmitted over the network, minimizing bandwidth requirements and improving transmission speed (Rady et al., 2020; Karim et al., 2023). Lossless compression algorithms, such as Huffman coding and LZW, preserve data integrity while effectively reducing data size, ensuring that no information is lost during transmission (Cui, 2023). Lossy compression algorithms, such as JPEG and MP3, offer higher compression ratios but introduce a controlled level of data loss, which may be acceptable for certain applications where some loss of precision is tolerable (Karim et al., 2023). The choice between lossless and lossy compression depends on the specific application and the trade-off between data size and accuracy.
Data aggregation techniques provide another effective approach to optimize data transmission. By aggregating multiple sensor readings into a single representative value, such as average soil moisture or temperature, the number of transmissions can be significantly reduced, conserving bandwidth and energy resources (Cui, 2023). This is particularly beneficial in large-scale irrigation systems where numerous sensors are deployed across vast areas, generating substantial amounts of data. Additionally, data filtering techniques play a crucial role in improving data quality and reliability. Kalman filters and particle filters can effectively remove noise and outliers from sensor data, ensuring that only accurate and relevant information is transmitted and used for decision-making (Cui, 2023). This is essential for preventing erroneous data from influencing irrigation decisions and potentially leading to suboptimal water management.
Sensor calibration, drift correction, and fault detection are essential for maintaining data accuracy and reliability (Dos Santos et al., 2023). Regular calibration ensures that sensors provide accurate measurements over time, while drift correction techniques account for gradual changes in sensor readings due to environmental factors or aging. Fault detection mechanisms can identify and address sensor malfunctions or anomalies, preventing erroneous data from influencing irrigation decisions and potentially harming crops or wasting water.
Addressing the Challenges
Effectively addressing the challenges in real-time data transmission requires a multifaceted approach that encompasses environmental, technical, and data-related considerations. Implementing robust and adaptive communication protocols is crucial for overcoming interference and signal degradation caused by weather conditions and physical obstacles. Selecting appropriate protocols, such as LoRa or ZigBee, with suitable range and penetration capabilities can ensure reliable data transmission in challenging agricultural environments (Motamedi & Villányi, 2022). Additionally, employing techniques like frequency hopping and error correction codes can further improve communication resilience and mitigate data loss.
Optimizing network architecture is another key consideration. Deploying a distributed network architecture with edge and fog computing capabilities can significantly enhance data processing and transmission efficiency (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2019). Edge devices can perform initial data processing and aggregation tasks, reducing the amount of data transmitted to the cloud and minimizing latency, while fog nodes can provide additional processing power and storage closer to the data source, enhancing scalability and reliability. This distributed approach alleviates the burden on the central cloud server and allows for more responsive and efficient irrigation management.
Data optimization techniques play a vital role in reducing bandwidth requirements and improving transmission efficiency. The choice of data compression, aggregation, and filtering techniques should be tailored to the specific requirements of the irrigation system, considering factors such as data type, accuracy needs, and available bandwidth. By carefully selecting and implementing these techniques, the overall performance and effectiveness of real-time irrigation systems can be significantly enhanced, leading to more sustainable water management practices and improved agricultural productivity.
By addressing these challenges and implementing appropriate solutions, real-time data transmission can become a reliable and efficient component of automated irrigation systems, contributing to the overall goal of achieving sustainable and productive agriculture in the face of growing food demands and water scarcity.

3.6. IoT Network Architectures and Variable Rate Irrigation (VRI) for Real-Time Irrigation
Real-time irrigation management systems heavily rely on the efficient and reliable transmission of data from sensors and weather stations to the cloud for processing and decision-making. However, agricultural environments present unique challenges to wireless communication, including adverse weather conditions, physical obstacles, and the limitations of wireless technologies. These challenges necessitate robust and adaptive solutions to ensure the consistent and timely flow of data, enabling truly autonomous irrigation scheduling.
Environmental factors, such as heavy rain, fog, and strong winds, can significantly disrupt wireless communication by attenuating or even blocking radio signals, leading to data loss and compromised system performance (Ed-daoudi et al., 2023; Jukan et al., 2017; Yi & Ji, 2014; Zhang, Chang & Baoguo, 2018). Dense vegetation, buildings, and uneven terrain create further complications by causing multipath propagation and shadowing effects (Yim et al., 2018; Gautam and Pagay, 2020). The study by Yim et al. (2018) on LoRa networks in a tree farm environment exemplifies these challenges, revealing reduced communication range and data reliability compared to theoretical expectations. This underscores the need for carefully selecting and optimizing communication protocols and network parameters to ensure reliable data transmission in such environments.
The study by Guzinski et al. (2014a) using a modified TSEB model further highlights the importance of high-resolution data in accurately capturing the spatial and temporal dynamics of energy fluxes influenced by environmental factors. This emphasizes the need for advanced data acquisition and processing techniques that can effectively represent the complexities of agricultural settings.
The limitations of traditional wireless communication technologies, such as limited range and network congestion, pose additional challenges for large-scale agricultural operations. Long-distance data transmission can be hindered by range limitations, while network congestion arising from numerous sensors transmitting concurrently can lead to delays and data loss, hindering real-time decision-making (Hameed et al., 2020). Addressing these challenges requires the exploration of advanced networking technologies that can optimize spectrum utilization, mitigate interference, and improve reliability and efficiency.
Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) and Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) offer promising solutions for optimizing wireless communication in agricultural settings. CRNs empower devices with the ability to intelligently sense and adapt to the surrounding radio environment, dynamically adjusting transmission parameters to avoid interference and improve communication efficiency (Righi et al., 2017; Shafi et al., 2018; Trigka & Dritsas, 2022). Research has explored the potential of CRNs in predicting Radio Frequency (RF) power to avoid noisy channels and optimize spectrum utilization (Iliya et al., 2014; Iliya et al., 2014). These studies demonstrate the effectiveness of combining optimization algorithms with artificial neural networks (ANNs) to enhance the accuracy and generalization of RF power prediction, enabling CRNs to make informed decisions about channel selection and avoid interference.
DSA complements CRN technology by dynamically allocating unused spectrum, further enhancing spectrum utilization and reducing congestion (Shi et al., 2023). The numerical model developed by Shi et al. (2023) showcases the potential of CRNs and DSA for optimizing wireless communication in challenging environments.
The integration of CRNs and DSA into the IoT network architecture requires careful consideration of spectrum sensing techniques, network topology, and data security. Research on cooperative spectrum sensing suggests that distributed approaches, where sensor nodes collaborate and share information, can significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of spectrum sensing, particularly in dynamic environments (Trigka and Dritsas, 2022; Khalid & Yu, 2019). This collaborative approach enables a more comprehensive understanding of the radio environment and facilitates the identification of available frequency bands for data transmission.
The choice of network topology also impacts the performance and scalability of CRN-based irrigation systems. Mesh networks, where sensor nodes are interconnected and relay data for each other, offer enhanced resilience and coverage compared to star topologies where nodes communicate directly with a central gateway (Akyildiz & Vuran, 2010). However, mesh networks can be more complex to manage and may introduce additional routing overhead. The trade-off between network resilience and complexity needs to be carefully evaluated to select the most appropriate topology for a specific agricultural setting.
Data security and privacy are paramount concerns in IoT-based irrigation systems due to the sensitive nature of agricultural data (Gupta et al., 2020). Implementing secure communication protocols, authentication mechanisms, and encryption techniques is essential for protecting data integrity and ensuring system trustworthiness. Research on secure spectrum leasing and resource allocation algorithms for CR-WSN-based irrigation systems has demonstrated the potential of these technologies for enhancing security and efficiency (Hassan, 2023; Afghah et al., 2018).
In conclusion, the development of effective and reliable real-time irrigation management systems requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the challenges of data transmission in agricultural environments. The integration of robust and adaptive communication protocols, optimized network architectures, and advanced networking technologies like CRNs and DSA, along with a focus on data security and privacy, can contribute significantly to achieving the goal of autonomous and efficient irrigation scheduling.
4. AUTOMATED DATA PROCESSING IN THE CLOUD
4.1. Data Quality and Preprocessing
Data quality is paramount in automated irrigation systems as it directly influences the effectiveness of decision-making and water use efficiency. Issues like missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers arising from sensor malfunctions, environmental interference, or network problems (Lv et al., 2023) can significantly impact the performance of machine learning models used for irrigation scheduling and management.
Real-time data cleaning techniques are essential for addressing these challenges. Kalman filtering proves particularly effective in handling missing values and correcting erroneous readings by recursively estimating the system's state based on previous measurements and current sensor data, taking into account noise and uncertainty (Kim et al., 2020). Moving average techniques, by averaging consecutive data points, provide a more stable representation of the underlying trend, filtering out short-term fluctuations (Chhetri, 2023). For outlier detection, adaptive thresholding methods offer a dynamic approach, adjusting thresholds based on the statistical properties of the data to effectively identify anomalies and minimize false positives (Bah et al., 2021). These techniques are crucial in maintaining the integrity of real-time data streams and ensuring the accuracy of subsequent analyses.
Adaptive data preprocessing is essential for managing the diversity of data sources and formats commonly found in irrigation systems. Data normalization techniques, such as min-max scaling or z-score normalization, ensure that all features contribute equally to the analysis by transforming data values to a common scale (Pradal et al., 2016). This is crucial for preventing features with larger values from dominating the analysis and ensuring that all features are given equal consideration. Similarly, feature scaling methods, like standardization or normalization, optimize the range of feature values to improve the performance and convergence of machine learning models (Tortorici et al., 2024). By scaling features to a similar range, the influence of outliers is reduced, and the model's ability to learn from the data is enhanced.
Data fusion techniques play a critical role in integrating information from diverse sources, creating a more comprehensive and reliable dataset for irrigation management. Dempster-Shafer theory, a generalization of probability theory, allows for the expression of both uncertainty and the degree of conflict in evidence, making it suitable for fusing uncertain and conflicting data from heterogeneous sources (Sadiq and Rodriguez, 2004). This is particularly relevant in irrigation systems where data from different sensors may provide slightly different or even contradictory information due to sensor variations or environmental factors. Bayesian inference offers another powerful framework for combining information from multiple sources, updating the probability of a hypothesis as new evidence becomes available. By applying these techniques, data from soil moisture sensors, canopy temperature sensors, weather stations, and other sources can be integrated to provide a holistic understanding of crop water requirements and environmental conditions, leading to more informed and accurate irrigation decisions.
The impact of data quality extends beyond model accuracy to the robustness of machine learning models under varying conditions. Robust models should maintain consistent performance even when faced with data inconsistencies or unexpected situations. Techniques like data augmentation and domain adaptation can enhance model robustness by exposing the model to a wider range of data variations during training. Data augmentation involves generating additional training data by applying transformations or introducing noise to existing data, making the model more resilient to noise and variations in the real-world data. Domain adaptation techniques aim to adapt a model trained on one domain (e.g., a specific crop or geographic location) to perform well on another domain with different data characteristics. This is particularly relevant in irrigation management, where models may need to be applied to different crops, soil types, or climatic conditions.
The choice of data cleaning, preprocessing, and fusion techniques should be carefully considered based on the specific characteristics of the irrigation system and the available data. By selecting and implementing appropriate techniques, the accuracy, reliability, and robustness of machine learning models can be significantly improved, leading to more efficient and sustainable irrigation management practices.
4.2. Scalable and Autonomous Deployment using Containerization Strategies
The transition from data collection and transmission to efficient data processing requires a robust infrastructure capable of handling diverse workloads and data volumes. Containerization technologies, specifically Docker and Kubernetes, offer a promising solution for deploying and scaling data processing and machine learning modules within cloud environments like AWS, Azure, and GCP (Vargas-Rojas et al., 2024; Rosendo et al., 2022; Solayman & Qasha, 2023). Docker provides a standardized way to package applications and their dependencies into self-contained units known as containers, ensuring consistent and reproducible execution across different platforms (Rosendo et al., 2022). Kubernetes, acting as a container orchestrator, manages their deployment, scaling, and networking across a cluster of machines (Rosendo et al., 2022). This combination presents several advantages for automated irrigation management systems.
Firstly, containerization facilitates efficient resource utilization and scalability. By encapsulating applications and their dependencies, containers enable the isolation of resources and prevent conflicts between different modules (Vargas-Rojas et al., 2024; Solayman & Qasha, 2023). This isolation allows for the efficient allocation of resources, such as CPU, memory, and storage, to each container based on its specific needs. Kubernetes further enhances scalability by allowing for the automatic scaling of containers based on real-time demand, ensuring the system can adapt to varying workloads and data volumes, preventing bottlenecks, and ensuring responsiveness to changing conditions (Karamolegkos et al., 2023).
Secondly, containerization promotes portability and reproducibility. By packaging applications and their dependencies into a single unit, containers make it easy to move and deploy them across different cloud environments without the need for environment-specific configurations (Rosendo et al., 2022; Solayman & Qasha, 2023). This portability simplifies the development and deployment process, reducing the time and effort required to set up and manage the system. Additionally, containers ensure reproducibility by providing a consistent execution environment, regardless of the underlying infrastructure. This eliminates variability and ensures that the system will behave consistently across different deployments (Zhou et al., 2023).
Optimizing container orchestration and resource allocation is crucial to minimizing latency and maximizing throughput in real-time data processing pipelines. Techniques like auto-scaling and dynamic resource allocation play a critical role in this context (Hethcoat et al., 2024; Werner and Tai, 2023; Kumar et al., 2024). Auto-scaling automatically adjusts the number of container instances based on real-time demand, ensuring that sufficient resources are available to handle peak workloads while avoiding over-provisioning during periods of low demand (Hethcoat et al., 2024; Kumar et al., 2024). Dynamic resource allocation enables the fine-grained adjustment of resources allocated to each container based on its specific needs and the current workload (Werner and Tai, 2023). This ensures efficient resource allocation and provides each container with the necessary resources to perform its tasks effectively.
Performance monitoring tools, such as Kubernetes Metrics Server and Prometheus, are essential for gaining insights into the performance of containers and the overall system (Hethcoat et al., 2024; Kuity & Peddoju, 2023). These tools provide valuable data on key performance indicators, such as CPU and memory usage, network traffic, and application-specific metrics. By monitoring this data, administrators can identify bottlenecks, optimize resource allocation strategies, and continuously improve system performance (Hethcoat et al., 2024). This data-driven approach ensures that automated irrigation management systems can operate efficiently and reliably.
By integrating containerization technologies with optimization techniques and performance monitoring, automated irrigation management systems achieve the scalability, autonomy, and efficiency required for effective real-time data processing and decision-making. This approach facilitates a seamless and responsive system that can adapt to changing conditions and contribute to the overall goal of optimizing water resource management and increasing agricultural productivity.

4.3. Deploying ML Models for Data Processing
Transitioning from data collection, preprocessing, and transmission, the deployment of machine learning (ML) models marks a pivotal stage in the automated irrigation management pipeline. This stage entails utilizing cloud platforms to facilitate real-time data processing and inference, enabling data-driven decision-making for optimal irrigation management and ultimately contributing to fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.
Several architectures and frameworks exist for deploying ML models on cloud platforms, each offering unique advantages and catering to different requirements. TensorFlow Serving, for instance, provides a high-performance system specifically designed for serving TensorFlow models (Abadi et al., 2016). This framework enables efficient and scalable inference, making it suitable for real-time applications where low latency and high throughput are crucial. For instance, in a large-scale irrigation system with numerous sensors generating data continuously, TensorFlow Serving can efficiently handle the high volume of inference requests and provide timely predictions for irrigation scheduling. Similarly, Apache MXNet Model Server offers a flexible and efficient solution for deploying models trained with MXNet, supporting a wide range of deep learning models and inference backends (MXNet Developers, 2015). This versatility makes it suitable for complex irrigation systems that may utilize different types of ML models for various tasks, such as predicting crop water requirements, detecting plant stress, or forecasting weather conditions. ONNX Runtime, on the other hand, provides a cross-platform inference engine compatible with various ML frameworks, including PyTorch, TensorFlow, and MXNet (Microsoft, 2017). This versatility enables the deployment of models in diverse environments, facilitating interoperability and reducing the need for model conversion. For example, an irrigation system that uses models trained in different frameworks can utilize ONNX Runtime to deploy them on a single platform without the need for time-consuming and error-prone model conversion processes.
Choosing the appropriate architecture or framework depends on several factors, including the specific ML framework used for model training, the desired level of performance and scalability, and the need for cross-platform compatibility. For instance, if the primary concern is low latency and high throughput for real-time inference, TensorFlow Serving might be the optimal choice for TensorFlow models. However, if flexibility and support for various deep learning models are required, Apache MXNet Model Server could be more suitable. In cases where cross-platform compatibility is essential, ONNX Runtime offers a versatile solution.
Once the ML model is deployed, optimizing its performance and resource utilization becomes crucial for ensuring the efficiency of integrated end-to-end automated irrigation systems. Model compression techniques, such as pruning and quantization, offer effective methods for reducing the size and computational requirements of ML models without compromising accuracy (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). Pruning involves eliminating unnecessary connections or neurons from the model, effectively streamlining its structure and reducing computational complexity. This can be particularly beneficial for deep learning models, which often have a large number of parameters and can be prone to overfitting. By removing redundant or less important connections, pruning can improve modelgeneralizability and reduce inference time. Quantization, on the other hand, involves reducing the precision of model parameters, typically from 32-bit floating-point numbers to lower-precision formats such as 8-bit integers. This reduction in precision leads to smaller model sizes and faster inference speeds, making it particularly beneficial for resource-constrained environments or real-time applications. For instance, in edge computing scenarios where ML models are deployed on devices with limited computational resources, quantization can enable efficient inference without sacrificing accuracy.
Furthermore, hardware acceleration through the utilization of GPUs or TPUs can significantly enhance model performance by leveraging specialized hardware designed for parallel processing (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). GPUs, with their massive parallelism and high memory bandwidth, excel at accelerating matrix operations and convolutions, which are fundamental computations in many deep learning models. This acceleration can significantly reduce inference time and enable real-time processing of sensor data for timely irrigation decisions. TPUs, specifically designed for deep learning workloads, offer even greater performance and energy efficiency for specific model architectures. These hardware accelerators can drastically reduce inference time, enabling near real-time decision-making and enhancing the responsiveness of automated irrigation systems. For example, in a scenario where immediate response to changing weather conditions or soil moisture levels is critical, hardware acceleration can ensure that irrigation decisions are made and executed promptly.
In addition to model compression and hardware acceleration, distributed training techniques play a crucial role in optimizing the training process for large-scale ML models. Techniques such as Horovod and BytePS enable the distribution of training across multiple machines, effectively parallelizing the process and reducing training time (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). This is particularly beneficial for complex models with a large number of parameters or when dealing with large datasets. By leveraging distributed training, irrigation management systems can train more sophisticated models and improve their predictive capabilities, leading to more accurate and efficient irrigation decisions. For instance, a system that utilizes a deep learning model with millions of parameters can benefit from distributed training to reduce training time from days to hours, enabling faster model iteration and improvement.
Integrating the deployed ML models with other components of the automated irrigation management pipeline is essential for achieving a fully autonomous and cohesive system and addressing the need for seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system. Standardized protocols, such as MQTT and CoAP, provide lightweight and efficient communication channels for exchanging data between these components (Poojara et al., 2023; Jimenez et al., 2020a; Gour et al., 2023). MQTT, with its publish-subscribe architecture, enables real-time data streaming and event-driven communication, making it suitable for transmitting sensor data, control signals, and inference results (Raikar & M, 2023). This enables the ML model to receive real-time updates on soil moisture, weather conditions, and plant health, allowing for dynamic adjustments to irrigation schedules based on the latest data. CoAP, designed for constrained devices and low-power networks, offers a web-transfer protocol for resource-constrained environments, enabling efficient communication between sensors, actuators, and the ML models (Raikar & M, 2023). This is particularly relevant in situations where sensors or actuators have limited processing power or battery life, as CoAP minimizes communication overhead and energy consumption. Additionally, RESTful APIs provide a standardized interface for accessing and controlling the ML models, enabling seamless integration with other software components and facilitating system management and monitoring (Wang et al., 2022). This allows for easy integration with existing farm management systems or third-party applications, creating a unified platform for comprehensive irrigation management.4.4. Online Learning in the Cloud
The complexities of real-time data processing in irrigation management necessitate the exploration of advanced techniques to continuously learn and adapt to the dynamic nature of agricultural environments. Online learning algorithms offer a promising solution, enabling the continuous update and improvement of machine learning models based on incoming real-time data. This adaptability is crucial for addressing the challenges of changing environmental conditions, such as weather patterns and crop growth stages, and optimizing irrigation decision-making to enhance water usage efficiency and crop productivity.
Several online learning algorithms have demonstrated potential for real-time data processing and model adaptation in the context of irrigation management. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) facilitates the incremental update of model parameters with each new data point, allowing for efficient adaptation to changing data distributions (Bottou, 2010). This incremental learning process ensures that the model remains responsive to the latest conditions, minimizing the risk of outdated predictions and improving the accuracy of irrigation decisions. Passive-Aggressive algorithms, on the other hand, adjust model parameters only when a misclassification occurs, providing a computationally efficient approach for handling large data streams (Crammer et al., 2006). These algorithms offer a robust approach to handling noisy data, a common challenge in real-world sensor readings, by making small adjustments only when the model's prediction deviates significantly from the actual value (Fei et al., 2019). Online Random Forests extend the concept of random forests to the online setting, enabling the incremental construction and update of decision trees as new data arrives (Saffari et al., 2009). The continuous evolution of the ensemble ensures that the model remains relevant to the changing environment, capturing intricate relationships between variables and leading to more informed irrigation decisions.
Research in various domains highlights the importance of online learning for real-time data stream analytics. Snyder et al. (2020) explored the application of online learning techniques for identifying relevant tweets in real-time, improving situational awareness for first responders. The proposed interactive learning framework allows users to continuously label the relevance of incoming tweets, enabling the real-time refinement of the underlying machine learning model. This user-guided approach aligns well with the dynamic nature of irrigation management, where models need to continuously adjust to varying environmental conditions and crop water requirements. Similarly, research in the field of cyber-physical systems (CPS) underscores the need for online learning algorithms to effectively extract insights and knowledge from continuously generated data streams (Fei et al., 2019). These capabilities are crucial for enabling feedback loops between physical processes and cyber elements, facilitating the integration and optimization of CPS in irrigation management systems.
To implement online learning in cloud-based irrigation management systems, various architectures and frameworks can be considered. Apache Spark Streaming, Apache Flink, and AWS Kinesis provide scalable and fault-tolerant platforms for processing real-time data streams, allowing for the development of online learning pipelines that continuously ingest and analyze data to update machine learning models (Zaharia et al., 2012; Carbone et al., 2015; Amazon Web Services, 2023). These frameworks leverage serverless computing paradigms, automatically scaling resources based on the volume and velocity of incoming data, ensuring efficient resource utilization and responsiveness to fluctuations in demand (Fei et al., 2019).
Effectively managing the exploration-exploitation trade-off is crucial for optimizing online learning in irrigation management. Techniques such as Multi-armed bandits (Sutton & Barto, 2018), Bayesian optimization (Shahriari et al., 2016), and Reinforcement Learning (RL) (Sutton & Barto, 2018) can be employed to balance the allocation of resources between exploring new irrigation strategies and exploiting the current best-performing approaches. These techniques enable the identification of optimal irrigation policies, adapting to changing environmental conditions and maximizing long-term rewards.
In conclusion, online learning techniques, coupled with scalable cloud-based architectures, offer a powerful solution for real-time data processing and continuous adaptation in irrigation management systems. By leveraging algorithms like SGD, Passive-Aggressive, and Online Random Forests, along with stream processing frameworks like Apache Spark Streaming, Apache Flink, and AWS Kinesis, irrigation management systems can effectively handle the complexities of real-time data, optimize water usage, and enhance crop productivity in the face of dynamic environmental conditions.

Abstract In this paper, an automatic Smart Irrigation Decision Support System, SIDSS, is proposed to manage irrigation in agriculture. Our system estimates the weekly irrigations needs of a plantation, on the basis of both soil measurements and climatic variables gathered by several autonomous nodes deployed in field. This enables a closed loop control scheme to adapt the decision support system to local perturbations and estimation errors. Two machine learning techniques, PLSR and ANFIS, are proposed as reasoning engine of our SIDSS. Our approach is validated on three commercial plantations of citrus trees located in the South-East of Spain. Performance is tested against decisions taken by a human expert.

Introduction The efficient use of water in agriculture is one of the most important agricultural challenges that modern technologies are helping to achieve. In arid and semiarid regions, the differences between precipitation and irrigation water requirements are so big that irrigation management is a priority for sustainable and economically profitable crops (IDAE, 2005). To accomplish this efficient use, expert agronomists rely on information from several sources (soil, plant and atmosphere) to properly manage the irrigation requirements of the crops (Puerto et al., 2013). This information is defined by a set of variables, which can be measured using sensors, that are able to characterise the water status of the plants and the soil in order to obtain their water requirements. While meteorological variables are representative of a large area and can be easily measured by a single sensor for a vast land extension, soil and plant variables have a large spatial variability. Therefore, in order to use these parameters to effectively schedule the irrigation of the plants, multiple sensors are needed (Naor et al., 2001). Weather is one of the key factors being used to estimate the water requirements of the crops (Allen et al., 1998). Moreover, it is very frequent that public agronomic management organisms have weather stations spread around the different regions. These weather stations usually provide information of key variables for the agriculture like reference evapotranspiration (ET0) or the Vapour Pressure Deficit (VPD) that are of great importance to calculate the water requirements of the crops. Using variables related to the climate is the most common approach to create crop water requirement models (Jensen et al., 1970, Smith, 2000, Zwart and Bastiaanssen, 2004). Using these models, based on solely meteorological variables, a decision-making system can determine how a given crop will behave (Guariso et al., 1985). However, not all the regions have access to an extensive network of weather stations or they may not be nearby a given crop, thus the local micro-climates are not taken into account if only these parameters are used. Besides, irrigation models based only on climate parameters rely on an open loop structure. This means that the model is subject to stochastic events and it may not be able to correct the local perturbations that can occur when a unexpected weather phenomenon occurs (for instance irrigate the crop when it’s already raining) (Dutta et al., 2014, Giusti and Marsili-Libelli, 2015). Finally, monitoring other variables, such as hydrodynamic soil factors or water drainage, might increase the chances that the irrigation predicted by the models is properly used by the plants (Kramer and Boyer, 1995). Therefore, the usage of sensors that measures the soil water status is a key complement to modulate the water requirements of the crops. Soil variables, such as soil moisture content or soil matric potential, are considered by many authors as crucial part of scheduling tools for managing irrigation (Cardenas-Lailhacar and Dukes, 2010, Soulis et al., 2015). The information from soil sensors can be used to create better decision models with closed loop structures that adapt to weather and soil perturbations (Cardenas-Lailhacar and Dukes, 2010, Soulis et al., 2015). This practice, however, has not been widely adopted due to the technological limitations of available soil sensors, which required measured information to be registered and stored, traditionally using wired dataloggers, and limiting the installation flexibility and the real time interaction. This has changed recently with new generation sensors and sensor networks that are more versatile and suited to the agricultural environment (Navarro-Hellín et al., 2015). Combining climate and soil variables has therefore potential to properly manage irrigation in a more efficient way than other traditional approaches. However, it also entails a series of challenges related with the increased amount of data flow, its analysis and its use to create effective models, in particular when data provided by different sources may seem contradictory and/or redundant. Traditionally, this analysis and modelling is performed by a human expert who interprets the different variables. The need of a human agronomist expert is required due to the complexity introduced by the soil spatial variability, crop species variability and their irrigation requirements over the growth cycle (Maton et al., 2005), which require comparing crops models and local context variables to determine the specific water requirements to achieve a certain goal at a particular location. The complexity of this problem and the different sources of variability makes than even the best model may deviate from the prediction, which favours the use of close loop control systems combining soil and climate sensors over open loop systems as a way to compensate possible deviations in future predictions. Human expertise has been proved effective to assist irrigation management but it is not scalable and available to every field, farm and crop and it is slow in the analysis of the data and real time processing. Instead, applying machine learning techniques to replace the manual models and to assist expert agronomists allows the viability of creating automatic Irrigation Decision Support System. Machine learning techniques have been used previously to estimate relevant parameters of the crop (Sreekanth et al., 2015). Giusti and Marsili-Libelli(2015) present a fuzzy decision systems to predict the volumetric water content of the soil based on local climate data. Adeloye et al. (2012), proposed the use of unsupervised artificial neural networks (ANN) to estimate the evapotranspiration also based on weather information solely. King and Shellie (2016) used NN modelling to estimate the lower threshold temperature (Tnws) needed to calculate the crop water stress index for wine grapes. In Campos et al. (2016) the authors presented a new algorithm designed to estimate the total available water in the soil root zone of a vineyard crop, using only SWC sensors, which are very dependent of the location. Taking advantage of the soil information, Valdés-Vela et al., 2015, Abrisqueta et al., 2015 incorporates the volumetric soil water content, manually collected with a neutron probe, to agro-meteorological data. This information is then fed into a fuzzy logic system to estimate the stem water potential. Other approaches in the literature also make use of machine learning techniques – such as principal component analysis, unsupervised clustering, and ANN – to estimate the irrigation requirements in crops. However they do not specify the quantity of water needed (Dutta et al., 2014), they reduce the prediction to true or false, and/or they are based on open loop structures (Giusti and Marsili-Libelli, 2015, Jensen et al., 1970, Smith, 2000, Zwart and Bastiaanssen, 2004), only considering the weather information and, therefore, unable to correct deviations from their predictions. This paper proposes an automated decision support system to manage the irrigation on a certain crop field, based on both climatic and soil variables provided by weather stations and soil sensors. As discussed, we postulate that the usage of machine learning techniques with the weather and soil variables is of great importance and can help to achieve a fully automated close loop system able to precisely predict the irrigation needs of a crop. Our presented system is evaluated by comparing it against the irrigations reports provided by an agronomist specialist during a complete season in different fields. 2. System structure An irrigation advice system is based on the concept of predicting the waters needs of the crops in order to irrigate them properly. Traditionally this decision has been taken by an experienced farmer or an expert agricultural technician. Fig. 1 shows the flow diagram of which the proposed system is based. Download : Download high-res image (82KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Flow diagram of the proposed system. In this schema, an expert agronomist is in charge of analysing the information from different sources: Weather stations located near the crops that collect meteorological data, Crop and Soil characteristics (type, age, size, cycle, etc.) and Soil sensors installed in the crop fields. The expert analyses the information to provide an irrigation report, which indicates the amount of water needed to irrigate properly the crops in the upcoming week. To make this decision making process manageable, the information needed to create the irrigation report on the next week is only the information of the current week. Based on this concept, our Smart Irrigation Decision Support System (SIDSS) is proposed. In order to evaluate the performance and validity of our approach, the decision system will use the same information used by the expert agronomist and will output the water requirements for the upcoming week. This will ensure a fair comparison between the decisions taken by a human expert and the SIDSS. To accomplish this, the machine learning system must be trained with historical data and irrigations reports of the agronomist, using the irrigation decisions taken in these reports as the groundtruth of the system. The aim of the system is to be as accurate as possible to this groundtruth. Several machine learning techniques were applied and evaluated to achieve the best performance. Fig. 2 shows a diagram of the SIDSS. Download : Download high-res image (103KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Training inputs and targets of SIDSS. The Irrigation Decision System is composed of three main components: a collection device that gathers information from the soil sensors, weather stations that provide agrometeorological information and the SIDSS that, when trained correctly, is able to predict the irrigation requirements of the crops for the incoming week. Table 1 shows the set of possible input variables of the system. Table 1. Set of possible input variables of the system.

Collection device and soil sensors The information from the soil sensors is gathered using our own developed device that has been proved to be completely functional for irrigation management in different crops and conditions (Navarro-Hellín et al., 2015). This device is wireless, equipped with a GSM/GPRS modem, and is completely autonomous, so that the installation procedures are accessible to any farmer. Fig. 3 shows the collection device installed in a lemon crop field located in the South-East of Spain. Download : Download high-res image (302KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Device installed in a lemon crop field. The device allows to fully configure the recording rates of all the embedded sensors. In our experiments, a sampling rate of 15 min was set, since this gives a good balance between providing enough information to support a correct agronomic decision and maintaining the autonomy of the device with the equipped solar panel and battery (López Riquelme et al., 2009, Navarro-Hellín et al., 2015. The information is received, processed and stored in a relational database. 2.1.1. Soil sensors The soil control variables used to provide SIDSS with relevant information are matric potential (Ψm) and volumetric soil water content (θv), which are common in irrigation management (Jones, 2004). By using these variables, the irrigation can be scheduled for maintaining soil moisture conditions equivalent or close to field capacity in order to satisfy the required crop water requirements. Likewise, they can be used to maintain soil water content or soil matric potential under certain reference values proper of regulated deficit irrigation strategies. Both Ψm and θv are used to decide the irrigation frequency and to adjust the gross irrigation doses. Soil matric potential was measured with MPS-2 sensors (Decagon devices, Inc., Pullman, WA 99163 – USA), while volumetric soil water content was measured with both 10-HS (Decagon devices, Inc., Pullman, WA 99163 – USA) and Enviroscan (Sentek Pty. Ltd., Adelaide, Australia) sensors. Besides both previous soil sensors, another sensor is used. A pluviometer (Rain-o173-matic small, Pronamic Ltd., Ringkøbing, Denmark) was used under the dripper to provide accurate estimation of the amount of water applied and the irrigation run time. The information provided by this sensor was used to ensure that the farmer is following the instruction of the agronomic reports provided by the expert. Table 2 summarises the variables measured by the soils sensors. Table 2. Soil sensors technical information.

Weather stations Experiments took place in the Region of Murcia, Spain. In this region, there is a network of 45 agro-meteorological stations located in irrigated areas, the Agricultural Information Network System of Murcia (SIAM), funded by the EU and installed to help estimate the reference evapotranspiration (ET0) and the irrigation needs of crops after a severe drought between 1979 and 1985. The variables measured by the stations are the following: Temperature (T), Relative humidity (RH), Global radiation (GR), Wind speed (WS), Rainfall (RF), Dew point (DP), Vapour Pressure Deficit (VPD). These variables, measured by the different stations, are publicly available and can be downloaded from the SIAM website (SIAM, 2015). The weather stations are tested and calibrated periodically according to the manufacturer’s specifications. The amount of water required to compensate the evapotranspiration loss from the cropped field is defined as crop water requirement. Therefore, knowing the reference crop evapotranspiration is of key importance to estimate the crop’s water requirements. Using the FAO Penman–Monteith formulation (Allen et al., 1998), the daily reference crop evapotranspiration (ET0) can be calculated by means of the weather information. The crop evapotranspiration under standard condition (ETc) can be calculated using the single crop coefficient approach shown below: (1) where Kc is the crop coefficient and depends on multiple factors, namely, the crop type, climate, crop evaporation and soil growth stages. 2.3. Smart Irrigation Decision Support System The decision support system is the component in charge of taking the final decision on the amount of water to be irrigated, or equivalently, the number of minutes to irrigate considering constant water flow. This decision is taken automatically on the basis of the information provided by the sensors and the usage of machine learning and pattern recognition techniques. The aim of this component, therefore, is to mimic a human expert in the decision making process of weekly optimising the irrigation, which could assist the farmer. Applying machine learning techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) allow us to visualise the information to perform an initial exploratory analysis. Fig. 4 shows the LDA of the input, array containing the sensorial variables, and output, the estimated irrigation time need, used in the system. The output was divided in classes (18), each one representing the weekly irrigation time by increments of 150 min, from 0 to 2700 min. From this figure, it can be noticed that discrete classification in classes will be hard to accomplish due to the high number of classes necessary to precisely quantise the irrigation estimation. This is due to the fact that the variable to estimate – either the amount of water or the watering time-has an intrinsic continuous nature, since the expected output can take any real value between 0 and infinity. Therefore, conventional classifiers aiming categorical outputs – such as LDA (Fisher, 1938), SVM (Belousov et al., 2002), and ANN are not optimal for this application. Instead, methodologies based on regression (Wold et al., 1984), and/or fuzzy logic (Zadeh et al., 1996) allow us to estimate a more suited continuous variable. Download : Download high-res image (124KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Linear discriminant analysis for 18 irrigation time intervals. In this section, we propose two different techniques, each belonging to one of the previous families, to estimate the weekly required amount of water. As described in the introduction and experimental sections, both modelling techniques require a supervised training set in order to learn the irrigation model. 2.3.1. Partial least square regression Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR) (Wold et al., 2001) is a statistical method that seeks the fundamental relations between predictor and response variables. Predictor variables, X, are defined as the observable variables that can be measured and input into the decision system. Response variable Y are the outputs or estimates that must be deducted from the input. The relationship between both variable sets, and linear multivariate regression model, is found by projecting both predicted and observable variables into a new space, where latent variables are estimated to model the covariance structure between the predictor space and the observation space. This PLSR model is developed from a training set D = {X, Y} of S samples, which is composed of the predictor matrix X = [x1, … , xi, … , xS]T and the response matrix Y = [y1, … , yi, … , yS]T. xi is a column vector of K elements, that can contain all the sensor and weather variables measured at a given week i: (2) and yi is another column vector of M elements, containing the corresponding variables to be estimated at that week i. Since in our application this is only the irrigation time recommended at that week, yi is reduced to a scalar and M = 1: PLSR constructs new predictor latent variables, known as components, which are linear combinations of the original predictor observable variables. These components are created to explain the observed variability in the original predictor variables, while simultaneously considering the response variable. That is, the estimated latent variables are linear combinations of predictor variables that have higher covariance with Y. Using the latent variables leads to a regression models able to fit the response variable with fewer components. The PLSR learning model can be expressed as: (3) (4) where T and U are the projections – aka scores – of X and Y into a smaller L-dimensional latent space respectively, P and Q are the orthogonal projection matrices – aka loading matrices – and E and G the error residuals. P and Q can be obtained by eigendecomposition of the original matrices. Since the X-scores T are meant to be good predictors of Y, it can be approximated that: (5) Being F a new residual. This reduces the problem to find a set of weights W such that T = X ∗ W predicts X and Y reasonably well. As mentioned, these orthogonal coefficients should maximise the correlation between X and Y while explaining the variance of X: (6) P and Q can be solved by applying a Least Square Estimator (LSE) so: (7) (8) Finally, by rewriting the previous equation, it can be derived that: (9) Being B the PLSR regression coefficients. Once these coefficients have been learned, responses y∗ for new observation x∗ can be estimated by applying the learning model: (10) assuming an estimation error f. We favour the use of PLSR among other regression techniques due to its suitability when the number of predictors is bigger than the number of response variables, the responses are noisy and there is a high probability of having multicollinearity among the predictor variables. The multicollinear phenomenon happens when those variable are highly correlated, due to redundancy between sensors and or between meteorological factors. As it can be noticed, all these factors appear in our irrigation problem. 2.3.2. Adaptive neuro fuzzy inference systems Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS) (Jang, 1993) is a fuzzy inference system for systematically generating fuzzy rules from a given input/output D dataset. This machine learning technique combines advantages from fuzzy logic and artificial neural networks. On the one hand, it allows us to represent an element not only into categories but also into a certain degree of membership functions, which allows mimicking the characteristics of human reasoning and decision making. On the one hand, it can be trained and so can self-improve in order to adjust the membership functions parameters directly from data (Wang et al., 2006). The ANFIS architecture consists in a five-layer feedforward neural network (Fig. 5) whose parameters are updated using a combination of gradient descent and LSE in a two-pass learning algorithm. Download : Download high-res image (95KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Example of ANFIS architecture for a input x with K variables and a 1-variable output y. In a first forward pass step, neuron outputs are calculated layer by layer and some internal consequent parameters are identified by the least squares estimator (LSE) to obtain the final single output. The forward pass operation at layer 1 defines the fuzzy membership for each input variable X. Assuming a Gaussian distribution function , the output of this layer is given by: (11) Layer 2 is a multiplicative layer, which calculates the firing strength of the rules as a product of the previous membership grades. (12) Layer 3 is a normalising layer, where: (13) Layer 4 applies a node function: (14) where and are consequent parameters estimated using LSE. Finally, layer 5 is the output layer that provides the overall estimation y as a summation of all incoming signals. For the case M = 1, where only one output variable is estimated: (15) After the forward pass has been completed, an initial estimation is provided by the ANFIS network. Since initial premise parameters are initialised randomly, the initial estimation will differ greatly from the desired values Y. This error or difference between the desired output y and the estimated output for a given training sample {xi, yi} can be expressed as: (16) To correct this deviation, a second learning step, or backward pass, attempts to minimise the estimated error by modifying the value of the premise parameters until the desired and estimated outputs are similar. This process is performed using backpropagation, where the error is propagated back over the layers and decomposed into the different nodes using the chain rule. Gradient descend is used as optimisation technique to update the premise parameters while the consequent parameters are kept fixed until the next iteration. This double step learning process is repeated iteratively for every single sample in the training set until the estimated error is smaller than a given threshold, i.e. convergence is achieved, or a maximum number of iterations – epocs – are reached. The ANFIS implementation used in this work is taken from the Fuzzy logic toolbox (Inc, 2016), by Mathworks where the parameter Radii used to train was a scalar of value 0.75 and the average number of epochs used to train was 1500. 3. Experimental setup The system was evaluated in three commercial plantations of lemon trees in the Region of Murcia, located in the semiarid zone of the South-East of Spain where the water is very scarce and drip irrigation is commonly used. The irrigation criteria followed was to maximise the yield. Plantation 1. Fino lemon trees (Citrus limon L. Burm. Fil cv. 49) on Citrus macrophylla Wester, growing in a soil with a low water retention capacity. The soil is characterised by a deep and homogeneous sandy – clay – loam texture. The irrigation water had an electrical conductivity (EC) of 2200 μS cm−1. The orchard consist of 11 year old lemon trees with an average height of 3.5 m. Tree spacing was 7.0 m × 5.5 m, with an average ground coverage of about 47%. Two drip irrigation lines (0.8 m apart) were used for each tree row. There were 4 emitters (4 L h−1) on both sides of each tree. One sensor node was installed in the 5.5 ha orchard, with a soil matric potential sensor (MPS-2, Decagon devices, Inc., Pullman, WA 99163 – USA) at a depth of 30 cm and three soil moisture sensors at a depth of 20, 40 and 80 cm (Enviroscan, Sentek Pty. Ltd., Adelaide, Australia) located 20 cm from a representative dripper and 2.25 m from the trunk. According to the nearest weather station of SIAM, located about 5 km from the orchard, the climate was typically Mediterranean. Thus, over this period (2014), the annual rainfall for the area was 210 mm and ET0 was 1395 mm. The average wind speed was 1.66 m/s, generally light wind and sometimes moderate. Plantation 2 and 3. 40 and 35 year old lemon trees (C. limon L. Burm. Fil) cv. Fino and cv. Verna respectively, grafted on sour orange (Citrus aurantium L.), growing in a soil with a medium water retention capacity. The soil is clay sandy loam texture and the irrigation water had an electrical conductivity (EC) of 1600 μS cm−1 during all season except in summer which was of 2285 μS cm−1. The tree spacing was 7.0 m × 6.75 m and 6.75 m × 6.75 m and the average ground coverage about 57% and 50%, respectively. One drip irrigation line was used for each tree row. There were 8 and 6 emitters of 4 L h−1 per tree, respectively. One sensor node was installed in the Fino orchard (≈15 ha) and another in Verna orchard (≈23 ha), each with two soil matric potential sensor (MPS-2, Decagon devices, Inc., Pullman, WA 99163 – USA) at a depth of 25 and 45 cm and three soil moisture sensors at a depth of 25, 45 and 70 cm (10HS, Decagon devices, Inc., Pullman, WA 99163) located 20 cm from a representative dripper and the vertical canopy projection. According to the nearest SIAM’s weather station, located about 7 km from the orchards, the climate was also typically Mediterranean. Over this period (2014), the annual rainfall for the area was 150 mm and ET0 was 1250 mm. The average wind speed was 1.4 m/s, i.e. light wind generally. The decision of selecting these three plantations is based on the fact that all of them are mature lemon trees and therefore their water irrigation requirement differences depend mainly of environmental conditions (soil and atmosphere) rather than the plant. Besides, all the plantations use drip emitters of 4 L h−1 so estimating the irrigation runtime of the week instead of the water volume will be a correct approach. Drip irrigation provides a fixed volume of water per hour; the pressure is maintained using pressure compensating emitters. The Irrigation frequency is calculated taking into account that only a certain amount of water depletion is allowed before the next replenishment is scheduled. Thus, the run time (gross irrigation dose) is determined to be equivalent to the previous amount of water depletion. The experts only need to calculate the irrigation run time (minutes) and the number of watering times per week or day depending on the time of year or crop development stage. The main goal of the system, also reflected by the expert agronomist in his reports, is to maximise the yield (maximum production per crop surface) with an optimum water management. Since information from the weather stations, soil sensors and crops characteristics has different sampling periods, the first step is pre-process this information. After analysing several methods and time intervals it was decided that the best option was to calculate the week average value for each of the sensors or weather stations variable except for the rainfall where the total amount of rainfall during the week is used instead. The week average fits better than others method like the daily average due to the fact, that the irrigation reports from the expert agronomist are already fixed, limited and done weekly. Besides, adding more input will make the data sparser, making more difficult to find patterns in the feature space, requiring a higher amount of data to train the system accordingly. The input obtained will be a one dimensional vector xi for each week in which the columns are the different variables or inputs of our system. The target vector will be the water requirements of the crops in the following week yi. This information has been extracted from the agronomist expert weekly reports in order to be used as groundtruth for comparison as for supervising the learning process. Three datasets are available, each dataset represent a different plantation. Data was collected from January 2014 until June 2015. Each plantation dataset has 74 weeks of data, which makes a total of 224 weeks of data. To accomplish a proper analysis of the system, we have divided the experiment in two different scenarios. Both scenarios differ from the other on the training and testing split. Two machine learning methods are applied on each scenario, a method based on PLSR and a method based on ANFIS. The performances of both methods in the different scenarios are analysed. 4. Experimental results and discussion 4.1. Scenario 1 In this scenario, we aim to successfully predict the irrigation needs of one or several plantation, based on the information provided by the collection device and learned knowledge from a historical archive of the previous year irrigation reports. This is of obvious usefulness in real life. We will demonstrate this capability by predicting the irrigation needs of year 2015 for the three plantations based on the information of the year 2014. The training set is therefore composed by all 2014 weeks of data belonging the three plantations, while the test set is composed by all 2015 weeks belonging to the three plantations. The information given to the system, or input vector, is a critical part of the design. On the one hand using unnecessary features may make the system perform poorly due to redundant information and noise. On the other hand, using too few features may not provide all the required information. Therefore, among all the available features explained in Table 1, they will not all be necessary. Table 3 shows the features subsets selected for each test. Among all possible sets of features, only combinations with logical sense, according to an expert agronomist were chosen a priori for the different experiments. Performance of the different sets is shown in Fig. 6. Table 3. Features subset and variables associated.

Performance of the different sets of variables for linear regression and ANFIS. The set that accomplish the best performance for both methods is F6, with and error of 155.1 and 121.1 min week−1 for PLSR and ANFIS respectively. In order to put this error into context, it can be noticed that 2.5 extra hours of irrigation represent around 10% of the total time in summer months – and up to 20% in spring and autumn months, being 10% error considered as an acceptable error in agriculture (Bos et al., 2004). Therefore, this feature set F6 will be the input vector of the system. It can be noticed that including the rain as input of the system (F7), increases the error. In the Region of Murcia, the rainfall are extremely low (around 210 mm per year) and usually being concentrated in a few days of the year, being the weekly total rain in most cases 0. With this information only available for the year 2014, the system didn’t have enough information to be trained properly and developed in unpredictable results. However we understand that in other regions the rainfall could be really useful to increase the performance of the system. Besides, considering the water retention capabilities of the soil, part of the rainfalls would be considered in the next irrigation report. Fig. 7 shows the water irrigation pattern over time predicted by the PLSR and ANFIS respectively when using feature set 6. Download : Download high-res image (137KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 7. Prediction of the water irrigation pattern using soil and weather information for the different plantations (Plantation 1: Week 1–24, Plantation 2: Week 25–48, Plantation 3: Week 49–72). The weekly errors for predicting the irrigation needs during the year 2015 in the three plantations are 155.1 and 121.1 min week−1 for PLSR and ANFIS respectively. The standard deviation for PLSR is 120.7. In the case of ANFIS, the standard deviation is 105.2. The total amount of time needed to irrigate the crops in the three plantations in 2015 is 65,641 min. ANFIS method estimates this value in 60,506 min and PLSR estimates 63,240 min. As conclusion, ANFIS performance is better than PLSR for each individual week water requirement estimation. However, PLSR estimation also follows the irrigation pattern accurately and estimates the total amount of water required more accurately over time than ANFIS, which seems to be more conservative in the water usage. Looking at the higher peaks of water requirement in the graphs, PLSR may overestimate the water needs while ANFIS is more accurate in general. It is important to note that in agronomy the most important point is not only the amount of water plants need but when they need it (Allen et al., 1998). Following this criterion, the performance of ANFIS is much better than PLSR for this scenario. Another factor that is important to analyse in this research is the use of soil sensors in addition to weather stations to close the loop. We consider that using this kind of sensors to estimate the water requirements of the crops improves the accuracy of the estimation and helps to deal with local disturbances. Since this is one of our main contributions and differences with other proposed automatic irrigation systems, a detailed analysis of the contribution of these variables is needed to validate our hypotheses and facilitate comparison with previous research systems. Therefore, the input vector was changed, using only weather information to train the system and predict the irrigation time. Table 4 shows the weekly average error for different sets of input vectors. Table 4. Summary of the performance of the different subsets.

Prediction of the water irrigation pattern using weather information for the different plantations (Plantation 1: Week 1–24, Plantation 2: Week 25–48, Plantation 3: Week 49–72). The error in PLSR using only weather information is 175.3 min week−1 with a standard deviation of 147.6. In the case of ANFIS, the error is 159.6 min week−1 with a standard deviation of 146.6. Although in general the shape of the graph is quite similar to the one using both soil and weather. The use of soil sensors gives a fine adjustment increasing the accuracy of the estimation for both PLSR and ANFIS reasoning engines. It can be concluded that a much better performance in the weekly irrigation estimation (around a 22% smaller weekly average error) is achieved when adding soils sensor information to the weather information. Next, a cross-validation strategy is applied to the scenario to validate how the results will generalise to an independent dataset. In cross validation, the complete dataset of the three plantations is divided in training and testing sets. The method used to cross-validate the information is Leave one out (LoO CV), a particular case of the Leave-p-out cross-validation (LpO CV). Kohavi, 1995, Picard and Cook, 1984 that involves using 1 observation as the testing set and the remaining observations as the training set. This process is repeated the number of samples times (n) changing the test sample each time to validate the system with all the samples. Cross validation method was used for both PLSR and ANFIS. Fig. 9 shows the results of this LoO Cross-Validation method for PLSR and ANFIS respectively using the set F6 as input vector.

Cross-validation LoO prediction for linear regression and ANFIS (Plantation 1: Weeks 1–52 and 157–180, Plantation 2: Weeks 53–104 and 181–204, Plantation 3: Weeks 105–156 and 205–229). The error in PLSR is 277.8 min week−1 with a standard deviation of 153.2. In the case of ANFIS, the error is 87.6 min week−1 with a standard deviation of 102.9. The total amount of time needed to irrigate the crops for the 189 weeks in the three plantations is 214,020 min. The ANFIS method estimates this value on 213,180 min and PLSR estimates 213,960 min. Table 5 summarises the result of the experiments. Table 5. Scenario 1 results summary. Results Average weekly error (min) With soil sensors No soil sensors Scenario 1 Predict 2015 PLSR 155.1 175.3 ANFIS 121.1 159.6 Cross-Validation PLSR 277.8 295.7 ANFIS 87.6 211.9 Similar conclusions are extracted using Cross-Validation. Both PLSR and ANFIS systems are really close to the groundtruth in the total amount of water estimated but it is clear that ANFIS performs much better than PLSR if we consider the weekly error. It is also confirmed that using soil sensors in addition to weather information results in a better performance for both ANFIS and PLSR methods. The improvement on ANFIS performance during cross validation is explained by the larger amount of training data regarding the “predict 2015” experiment. This behaviour is expected due to the nature of neural networks, which require large amount of data to be trained in comparison with other machine learning techniques and we predict than having a historical archive longer for training could results in a further improvement. Although we are validating our systems with the three plantations described before as case of study, in principle, our methodology has been designed to be independent of the crop, terrain and location of the plantation, aiming to propose a general close-loop automatic irrigation estimator. In practical terms, this means that to apply our system to new plantations, training data in the form of sensor and weather weekly data as well as irrigation reports provided by and expert agronomist for the new plantation will be needed. Since these reports can be expensive and compiling a substantial amount of weekly reports is time consuming and must be planned in advance, it is important to know how big the dataset must be and how the performance may improve with the number of training weeks. Therefore, as final experiment to obtain an estimation of the required amount of training data for a new crop/plantation, the complete dataset was divided in different percentages of training and testing. Fig. 10 shows the weekly error of both PLSR and ANFIS methods with respect to the training dataset percentage. Download : Download high-res image (68KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 10. Performance comparison for linear regression and ANFIS with respect to the % of samples used to train. According to the figure, it is noticeable that ANFIS performance is much better than PLSR if there are enough samples to train the system. In cases where the percentage of samples for training is low (less than 25% of the data, i.e. less than 4 months of data for a given field), PLSR overperforms ANFIS. This case is relevant for new plantations without historical data of previous reports. In such situations, the PLSR predictive model may be used in early stages, before switching to ANFIS once enough samples to train the system properly are collected. 4.2. Scenario 2 The goal is to predict the irrigation of a plantation based on its weather and soil measured variables but using a SIDSS system trained exclusively with other fields. This will be the hardest scenario as it will be necessary to predict the irrigation needs of a field with no previous irrigation reports of that specific plantation. This scenario attempts to show the potential of our methodology to create a universal irrigation estimator of a given crop – in our case, lemon trees – for any given plantation, independently of the location and/or terrain. A lower performance can be expected in comparison to what could be achieved by retraining the system with information of the plantation (scenario 1), which is sacrificed for the benefit of not having to generate manual irrigation report for new plantations. Cross validation, specifically leave-one_plantation-out is applied in validation. Thus, 2014 and 2015 data from two of the plantations are used for training, while the remaining plantation data (2014 + 2015) is used for testing. This is repeated 3 times, leaving a different plantation out of the training set each time, and the results averaged. Table 6 shows the error and standard deviation of this scenario for PLSR and ANFIS using different features vector used to compare the performance. Table 6. Scenario 2 results summary.

In this case PLSR outperforms ANFIS with an average error of 257.0 min in comparison with 323.3 min for ANFIS. However, we noticed that, in this scenario, removing the VWC1 sensor results in a better performance for both methods as a universal estimator. This is explained because the VWC sensor is very dependent on the soil where it is installed and, as both algorithms were trained with a sensor installed in a different plantation than the one that is predicting, the provided information introduces noise and does not help the system to estimate properly the water need. This does not happen, however, with the SWP sensor, which quantifies the tendency of water to move from one area to another in the soil and it is less dependent on the soil installed. Removing the VWC sensor results in a better performance of the system obtaining an average weekly error of 194.4 min with PLSR and 197.4 min with ANFIS. This result proves that there is certain potential to develop a universal estimator using our system for a given crop, although this means an increase of the average error. This error could be reduced if more than 2 plantations of the same crop were available for training. Both PLSR and ANFIS performs similarly, being PLSR slightly better. 5. Conclusions This paper describes the design and development of an automatic decision support system to manage irrigation in agriculture. The main characteristic of system is the use of continuous soil measurements to complement climatic parameters to precisely predict the irrigation needs the crops, in contrast with previous works that are based only on weather variables or doesn’t specify the quantity of water required by the crops. The use of real-time information from the soil parameters in a closed loop control scheme allows adapting the decision support system to local perturbations, avoiding the accumulative effect due to errors in consecutive weekly estimation, and/or detecting if the irrigation calculated for the SIDSS has been performed by the farmer. The analysis of the performance of the system is accomplished comparing the decisions taken by a human expert and the decision support component. Two machine learning techniques, PLSR and ANFIS, have been proposed as the basis of our reasoning engine and analysed in order to obtain the best performance. The experiments have taken place in three commercial plantations of citrus trees located in the South-East of Spain. A first experimental scenario shows a comparison of the system’s performance using soil sensors in addition to the weather information for predicting year 2015 using 2014 information to train the system. The usage of soil sensor in the three plantations accomplished a 22% less of weekly error in comparison to the performance of using only weather information. A second scenario shows the potential of our system as universal estimator for a given crop, i.e. the use case of installing the system in a new plantation, not having previous information of it. For this application, VWC sensors should be removed due to their high dependence with the soil type. Although, as expected, the estimation error increases in this scenario, it does not require historical data from agronomical reports to be retrained, which implies a significant advantage, in particular for new plantations in early stages. If more training data from a bigger variety of field were available, a better performance in this scenario could be expected. Another possible improvement for this scenario will be the addition of a VWC to get a better performance than using only the matric potential sensors. However, in order to use the VWC sensor in this scenario, a precise study of the soil textures of the plantation will be required to extrapolate the VWC sensor information to similar soil textures where the DSS was trained. For future research, we aim to extend and evaluate the system in plantations different than citrus and analyse the performance under several conditions and regions. Thus, adding the weather forecast as input of the SIDSS could help to improve the next week irrigation schedule and consider the predicted rainfall in our estimation. Similarly, past rainfall information, that did not prove beneficial in our system due to the region of Murcia characteristics, may become a good factor to improve the accuracy of the system in regions with a more regular and predictable raining pattern. We also aim to capture a bigger dataset that will allow us to generate more general models towards a universal irrigation estimator of a given crop. This dataset will also explore the use of multiple sensors per plantation in order to address inhomogeneous ground conditions in the different plantation as well as provide more input information to the system for a better reasoning.

  Extract 1: The present positive results encourage the expansion of the research and development ideas to consider other aspects of water distribution, on-farm as well as urban.
  Extract 2: On the basis of these outcomes large scale implementation in Victoria has commenced. The white paper on water released by the State Government of Victoria identified that the implementation of advanced control, along the lines expounded here, will save about 400 Mm3of water per year when completed across all of the irrigation districts in Victoria.

By supplementing these large scale civil engineering systems with an appropriate information infrastructure, sensors, actuators and a communication network it is feasible to use systems engineering ideas to improve the exploitation of the irrigation system. This paper reports how classical ideas from system identification and control can be used to automate irrigation systems to deliver a near on-demand water supply with vastly improved overall distribution efficiency. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Large scale systemsIrrigation systemsSystem identificationControlSCADA 1. Introduction Over the last 7 years researchers at the University of Melbourne have collaborated with Rubicon Systems Australia to achieve near on-demand water supply in open channel irrigation systems. The research and development process started by considering what appeared to be a case of local controllers that created large excursion periodic flow and water levels in the water canals, perhaps due to bad tuning of the controller gains. The journey went through modeling and control design, including the development of new sensor and actuator hardware and pilot projects culminating in the present industrial scale ongoing project where based on the developed ideas and technology a large irrigation system in Victoria is being fully automated. Upon completion it will be the first entire irrigation system under closed loop control where water orders are met in real time on demand in as much as this is physically realisable. This paper reports on some aspects of this journey. A corresponding paper trail can be found in the bibliography. The patents Mareels et al., 2000, Mareels et al., 2001 describe the overall systems engineering philosophy in conjunction with the newly developed hardware for both measuring and controlling water in open channels. So far the research and development effort has focused on controlling water quantity in open channels, as captured in water flow, volume and water levels. This paper is solely devoted to this issue. In future developments it is envisaged that water quality will become a major focus for control. Sensors can assess the biological and chemical content of water to determine its quality in real time. The information infrastructure to be discussed can then be used to advantage to manage water quality as well as water quantity. In Australia, irrigation accounts for 70% of all fresh water usage Securing our Water Future Together, 2004, The United Nations World Water Development Report, Executive Summary, 2003, Water and the Australian Economy, 1999, Water Savings in Irrigation Distribution Systems, 2000. The majority of irrigation is achieved through an extensive civil infrastructure of reservoirs and open canals that supplies fresh water to farms. The large scale distribution of water is powered purely by gravity. Also on most farms, a gravity fed system is in use, such that the amount of farm land that can be irrigated through the on-farm water outlet is directly limited by the available water level (potential energy) at the canal outlet, the on-farm supply point. In the reports The United Nations World Water Development Report, Executive Summary, 2003, Water and the Australian Economy, 1999, Water Savings in Irrigation Distribution Systems, 2000, overall water efficiency in irrigation, that is the ratio of volume of water used by crops and life stock to volume of water extracted from the available fresh water resource is estimated to be less than 50%. In Australia, the losses are reportedly evenly split Water and the Australian Economy, 1999, Water Savings in Irrigation Distribution Systems, 2000 between the large scale distribution losses and on-farm losses. The latter are to a large extent due to poor timing of irrigation, a consequence of manual water scheduling on the supply canals. Furthermore, the on-farm losses if coupled with poor drainage lead to soil degradation (irrigation–drainage imbalance induced salination of soils). Most of the large scale distribution losses are due to the natural tendency to oversupply water, as a lack of water has obviously averse effects on the yield. Some losses are due to evaporation and canal seepage. In Australia, over supplied water simply means that water spills out at the downstream end of the irrigation system, and is no longer available to supply irrigation. The water remains of course part of the natural hydro cycle. Policy makers in Australia have recognized that is important to re-consider present water practices in view of long term environmental and sustainability issues. Indeed, Australia is a very dry continent that presumably cannot sustain the present exploitation levels of its natural water resources. Climate change, population and industrial growth pressures compound the problem. Here, it is argued that irrigation efficiency is an ideal objective for closed loop control. Irrigation efficiency can be vastly improved by installing an information technology infrastructure: sensors and actuators linked through a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) communication network. The data derived from this can be exploited using systems identification and control techniques to manage the civil infrastructure to achieve superior efficiency and support new policies in support of long term sustainable water use. Besides the improved distribution efficiency, the near on-demand water delivery that is achieved leads to significant on-farm efficiency improvements as well. The system identification and control ideas to be discussed are quite classical, and in this way the paper illustrates the strength of the present state of the art in control and systems identification theory. Nevertheless, new questions or perhaps new emphases appear and a number of interesting open problems that are particularly relevant to large scale systems engineering are identified. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. First, a particular implementation of an automated, SCADA-equipped irrigation system, installed in Victoria, Australia is described. The physical constraints in the irrigation infrastructure, which ultimately limit the performance that can be achieved, are touched upon. The control and management objectives are briefly outlined. System modeling is discussed next. Models derived from the St-Venant equations and grey box models are compared as to their utility/effort in the context of modeling for control and fault detection. Next, model based control ideas are pursued. A variety of distributed control and centralised control strategies are briefly introduced. More importantly the impact of automation and the diminishing returns of increased control effort and control sophistication are identified. Results from the field describing the quality of the proposed models and controls are discussed. 2. Irrigation systems 2.1. Canal infrastructure Refer to Fig. 1. Through a series of open canals, water is distributed from reservoirs to farms under the driving force of the available potential energy at the reservoir. The routing and scheduling of water is realized through the adjustment of regulator structures (gates) placed in the canals. These gates restrict the water flow in the canals. A stretch of canal between up- and down-stream gates is called a pool. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Schematic representation of open canal infrastructure; vertical cross section through canal centre. A section of a canal network is represented in Fig. 2. The canal topology can be represented like a directed graph (nodes are regulators, arcs are pools, the direction is the flow). In most gravity fed systems the graph is a tree (but this is not always the case). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Schematic representation of open canal topology. The discussion here focuses on the so-called overshot gates (FlumeGate ™ )1 that were developed in the course of the project. In these gates, water flows over the top of the gate leaf, the angle of which can be adjusted to change the amount of water that flows over it. The gates can operate in the overflow regime, where the down stream water level is below the gate level (as on the left in Fig. 1), or drowned condition, where the downstream level is above the gate level (as is illustrated on the right in Fig. 1). At the gate water levels immediately downstream and upstream of the gate are measured. The main farm outlets are found near the downstream end of a pool. In Australia, the canals are designed for flow, and are rather shallow and narrow, with little storage in pools. A typical slope of the canal floor is 1/10,000. The canals have little free board, in most instances water will spill if the water level would reach 0.5 m above the design level. The canal and reservoir infrastructure is substantial. The replacement value (for Australia) is in the order of several tens of billion dollars in investment. To understand the scale, consider the following data for a medium size irrigation district in Australia that was used in the pilot projects described here: 500 km of main irrigation canal; about 500 regulator structures in the canals; over 600 on-farm outlets; 1.1 Gm2 of farm land irrigated; an annual water allocation of about 0.6 Gm3. The Goulburn-Murray irrigation district, the largest in Australia, is more than 10 times this size (7000 km of canal; 17,000 regulators and 21,000 on-farm outlets, annual average irrigation water allocation in excess of 2 Gm3) and irrigation districts in excess of 100 times this size exist in the USA, Pakistan, India and China. The quality of the irrigation service, from a farmer’s perspective, is determined by the timing of the irrigation water and in case the on-farm irrigation is also gravity fed, also by the water level at the on-farm outlet. Clearly using open canals with banks that are not water tight to effect water distribution implies losses through evaporation and seepage. The combined effect of these is estimated at around 10 to 15% of supply (Water and the Australian Economy, 1999). At present these losses are insufficient to warrant consideration of replacing the canal infrastructure by a piped water network (which after all also has its own problems with leaks). 2.2. Automation infrastructure Fig. 3 illustrates in situ the new hardware replacing the manually controlled on-farm outlets. During the course of the project, new sensors and actuators were developed which form the subject of two patent applications Mareels et al., 2000, Mareels et al., 2001. The actual locations for the gates in the canals are as determined by the existing infrastructure under manual control, and no optimization of gate placement, in view of the new and automated management regime, has been considered thus far. This is an interesting aspect of the overall system design that is under further investigation. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Automated gates and communication infrastructure. For the purpose of distributing water from reservoir to farm, all the gates both in the main canals as well as the on-farm outlets, are actuated and equipped with sensors for water levels and actual gate position (the gate angle is measured). The fact that on-farm outlets are also actuated and equipped with sensors enables inter alia the measurement of the actual water demand. Actuation and monitoring functions are typically collocated, and very few sole purpose actuator or monitoring sites are in use. Each gate/site can communicate via a cellular packet based radio network to any other site in the network. The communication network enables both broadcasting (e.g. for software upgrades) as well as peer to peer communications on all sites. A typical direct peer group contains up to 10 sites (see also Fig. 2). For the above described average irrigation district there are just over a 1000 sites, the maximum number of router hops for site to site communications is six, whereas a direct communication to the centralnode requires at most three router hops. For reasons of security and reliability, the network management overhead in data communication is large, and the actual net data throughput is very low (measured in bits per second). The required data rate for control purposes is kept to a minimum by using event driven communication and by using a particular decentralized control structure. Event based communication means that measurement data are only communicated when a water level change (a gate movement or a set point change) exceeds a predetermined threshold. Even then, the sensor data must compete with other event driven communications such as demanded by various hardware and software alarms. As a consequence the time required to successfully complete a communication cannot be guaranteed with certainty. Although and this is confirmed by experience over a few irrigation seasons, the design methods for the communication network are such that with very high confidence the maximum communication delay for a data packet can be specified. The other technique used to minimize the data rate requirements is the particular decentralized control structure that is implemented. It is such that water demand information only has to be passed on to the nearest upstream regulator, which only requires a peer to peer session, without supervisory intervention. Moreover, the central supervisory control node does not need regular sampling of sensors and/or actuator states and can use the event driven data to implement global network policies. Locally, at the gate level, all data about sensors, actuators and hardware conditions are monitored on a regularly sampled basis, and a long history of all variables is maintained in memory. At the central node, a global data base of all reported and requested events is maintained. In this data base, the topology of both the information network and the irrigation network is also stored. This topology is further enhanced by descriptors for all models for pools, regulators and sensors, and the corresponding control algorithms. 2.3. Objectives From a real-time control point of view the main objectives are: • optimization of distribution efficiency, i.e. minimize the total amount of water supplied by matching supply to demand. Maximal distribution efficiency is attained when there is a zero outflow at the bottom end of the canal tree; • real-time on-demand water supply of the requested water volumes to all irrigation outlets; and • water level regulation at the on-farm outlet to a given set point (within an agreed dead-band limit). The supervisory control has to ensure that the physical flow capacities are not exceeded, that the water set points are as agreed by the stake holders and that the distributed water remains within the allocations set by the regulating bodies (as modified by water trade). Clearly, the supervisory control task is in itself a dynamic object. The supervisory control system receives demand requests by the farmers through an automated ordering system. These orders are verified, if the water order is legitimate and if there is the physical capacity to supply before the water order is processed. If rejected, the water order can be rescheduled to an agreed time. The supervisory control system can suggest alternative time slots for the water order. These aspects are not discussed further. That some form of rescheduling is in general unavoidable is clear from the histogram in Fig. 4. It shows the distribution of regulator sizes (in flow m3/s) for one section of the above irrigation system. The total on-farm installed outflow capacity in this section is close to 25 m3/s, which is a little more than four times the inflow capacity (the in flow capacity at the top regulator is 6.1 m3/s). This is typical across the entire irrigation system. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Histogram of regulator sizes in m3/s at the downstream end in a typical irrigation district. Equally important from a management perspective is to keep track of water flow and water volumes, as well as the general condition of the irrigation canals (e.g. leakage detection, evaporation losses, hardware failures). 3. Models for irrigation systems Understanding the behaviour of the irrigation system is key to arriving at an acceptable closed loop control solution. The natural subsystems in irrigation systems are a single pool and the regulator structures. Given the topology of the irrigation system, an entire model is then but the concatenation of pool and regulator models as dictated by the system topology (see Fig. 2). 3.1. St-Venant equation based models Traditionally, open channel dynamics are described using the shallow water equations, or the so called St-Venant equations Brutsaert, 1971, Chaudhry, 1993, Cunge et al., 1980. One particular representation is given by (1) which models the mass balance along the length of the pool, and (2) which models the momentum balance along the length of the pool. Here, is time, and is a position along the centre line of the pool, where is the length of the i th pool. In (1), (2), is the water cross section at position xalong the center line of pool i at time t (it equals the local depth of water times the width of the canal). is the width of the pool at position x, it is assumed that the cross section of the canal is rectangular. The width information can be obtained either from design drawings, or perhaps more interestingly from satellite images. is the total flow in m3/s through the cross section . represents the flow off-take per meter canal (in m2/s) at position x. This term models not only a farm outlet, or an off-take into another pool/canal but also accounts for seepage and evaporation (hence the potential dependence on time, as seepage is subject to seasonal variation and evaporation experiences seasonal and diurnal variations). The represents the momentum loss per meter canal, due to friction but also water off-takes, seepage and evaporation. represents the slope of the bottom of pool i. The latter represents essentially the available potential energy per meter canal. The constant represents gravitational acceleration. The friction term is a nonlinear function of flow and area, for which various empirical formulas exist. Here, modeled as time-invariant, although slow time variations can be expected due to effects such as bank erosion and plant growth. The boundary conditions are the inflow into the top-end of the pool and the outflow at the bottom-end of the pool. These are to be derived from the hydraulic characteristics of the regulating structures at the up- and down-stream end of the pools. For , this will typically be a discharge from a reservoir, or major feed canal. for each of the end pools is to be minimised, ideally zero outflow is to be achieved. For the other boundary conditions , where is the hydraulic characteristic for that regulator, and is the control variable, which enables the variation of the flow through this regulator. Hydraulic characteristics can be determined from experimental data. Hydraulic characteristics essentially relate geometry of the regulator, as captured by the down and up-stream water conditions and the gate position to flow over the regulator. To complete the model for the purpose of prediction an initial condition has to be provided, a suitable starting point is a steady state flow condition (zero flow for example). The models (1), (2) are nonlinear partial differential equations, which can be solved using a numerical integration scheme. Typically, a Preismann scheme, which involves using a discretisation in both space and time domain Chaudhry, 1993, Cunge et al., 1980 is advocated. Despite the obvious physical interpretation that is associated with the variables, and the clear validity of the principles on which the St-Venant equations are constructed, these equations represent a considerable modeling cost when they are to be applied to a particular canal. In order for the model to become relevant to a particular canal, or pool it is necessary to fit functions like , , and . Typically this involves providing a parametric representation for these functions, and then estimating the parameters, using say non-linear least squares techniques, from a history of measurements. The mapping from the discrete values of flow and cross sections at certain positions along the canal, and at certain time instances to the parameters is not trivial. One such approach is discussed in some detail in (Ooi, Krutzen, & Weyer, 2003). It is shown there that the St-Venant equations are indeed adequate for the purpose of modeling of open channel behaviour. This study uses data from Australian irrigation canals. An earlier study (Brutsaert, 1971)also shows the adequacy of the St-Venant equation using a similarity study under laboratory conditions. Despite this, it is not clear that the cost of establishing an accurate quantitative model using this route is actually justified in the context of irrigation systems. Moreover, it is also not obvious that the St-Venant equations represent the most appropriate starting point for management and/or control of irrigation systems. In a nutshell, the advantage of the St-Venant equations, with the corresponding boundary and initial conditions, are: • familiar and physically relevant variables are modeled; • parameters have an obvious physical interpretation; • interpolation across all time and space (simulation information not limited to discrete sample points); and • an expectation to be reliable across a broad range of operating conditions. These have to be weighted against the obvious disadvantages: • significant cost in achieving quantitatively reliable models from discrete data; • significant cost, perhaps prohibitive cost to simulate an entire canal or irrigation system; and • relevance beyond the operational regimes remains questionable as it cannot be verified against real data. There is a more philosophical and more fundamental objection rooted in the way the St-Venant equations are actually used. As the St-Venant equations do not permit analytic solutions they are by necessity numerically integrated using some discretisation scheme. One could therefore argue that for all practical purposes the St-Venant equations are merely an abstraction (and perhaps a poor one). Clearly only the finite dimensional numerical approximation, a computer algorithm, is the real model. It is this computer algorithm that is tuned against the data and that forms the actual model and that predicts the actual behaviour. This begs a number of natural questions: • Can this finite dimensional and discrete time/space model not be considered as the basis for control design? • Which discretisation scheme is the most appropriate for control design? After all, only a small portion of the open-loop behaviour is targeted in closed-loop operation and there may be better schemes than the Preismann scheme. • Perhaps the model may be further simplified using model order reduction techniques to represent only adequately the smaller closed loop behaviour Litrico and Fromion, 2004, Litrico et al., 2003. Rather than pursuing these questions from a St-Venant equation perspective, which leads to several interesting open problems in the study of infinite dimensional systems, they are pursued directly from a data-to-model system identification perspective. 3.2. Grey box models The above motivates the consideration of a grey box, lumped model approach to construct a model for a pool adequate for control design in an irrigation system Eurén and Weyer, 2005, Ooi et al., 2003, Ooi et al., 2003, Ooi, 2003, Ooi et al., 2005, Weyer, 2001. It should be observed that significant simplifications as compared to the full complexity of the St-Venant equations may be expected as the management regime in an irrigation system requires tight control over the water levels, despite significant variations in flow. Hence, the model does not have to explain the behaviour over all possible water levels. What is minimally required is a model that links the control input which is the gate position at regulator i (a regulator may have several gates in parallel, but this issue is ignored to simplify the presentation) to water levels and flows at the critical points along the canals, typically the up- ( ) and down-stream water levels at the regulators. With reference to Fig. 5 consider a canal where all pools are simply in line. To further simplify the exposition, assume that the regulators are overshot gates in free-flow conditions. In this situation, the downstream water levels at the regulators are largely irrelevant. The ideas can be applied mutatis mutandis to other situations as well, including the more complicated situations with under shot regulators and drowned overshot gates (Eurén & Weyer, 2005). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. In-line canal system, a series of regulators and pools. The flow over the regulator i is a static function determined by the geometry of the regulator, which is varied by the gate position and the supply water level at the regulator site. This relationship is the hydraulic characteristic for the regulator, (3) Besides the hydraulic characteristic, a model for the dynamics of the pool is required. This model is in its simplest form a mass balance, the volume of water in the pool is increased by the flow over the up-stream regulator and decreased by the flow over the down-stream regulator. In Mareels et al., 2000, Mareels et al., 2001, Weyer, 2001, a model is proposed that captures conservation of mass, and the first mode of standing waves in a pool: (4) A continuous time model is used, as in general regular sampling is not available. This is therefore the preferred embodiment of the model. Although for identification purposes it is clear that the above model only requires local information at the upstream and downstream gate of the pool. In this situation, it is possible to obtain regularly sampled and synchronized data series of the water levels and gate positions for any particular pool. In (4), is the water level upstream of regulator i; is a time-delay. It is associated with the fastest wave phenomena in the pool between gates i and (which can be linked to the critical velocity in the pool (Chaudhry, 1993)). An action on the upstream end of the pool is observed at the downstream end of the pool after time units. The model dynamics are captured via the polynomial . For short pools, up to a few km in length, a polynomial of degree 3 suffices to achieve a high fidelity model. For such pools, the roots of consist of an integrator and a weakly damped oscillatory pair. The integrator captures the idea of water storage in the pool. The oscillatory roots capture the dynamics associated with the dominant standing wave(s) in the pool. The terms represent water off-takes between regulator i and and the are static gains. (Most off-takes are placed near the down-stream end of the pool, which simplifies the model, and ensures better quality of service for the farmer, as the down stream water level can be regulated more easily than the up stream water level.) Typical order of magnitudes for the various parameters in the Australian irrigation districts where field trials have been conducted thus far are: • time delay is approximately 3 min per km; • dominant wave period is approximately 9 min per km; and • achievable (closed loop) dominant time constant is approximately 10 to 15 min per km. The parameters appearing in (4) are readily obtained via standard linear system identification techniques. This can be done both from open loop experiments as well as from closed loop data Ooi et al., 2003, Ooi et al., 2003, Ooi and Weyer, 2001, Ooi et al., 2005, Weyer, 2001. The latter is critically important when considering a large scale irrigation system. The grey box model (4) compares favourably with the St-Venant models (1), (2) in that it has much lower complexity and yet similar or better prediction accuracy (see below and Fig. 6). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 6. Experimental validation of grey box and St-Venant based models. Validation tests across both low and high flow regimes have been completed. In Fig. 6, adapted from Ooi, Krutzen, & Weyer, 2003, a comparison is made between the St-Venant based models and the grey box models. The Fig. 6 represents a set of open-loop simulated model responses compared against the actual field measurements. The inputs to the simulation are the regulator positions over time (using the measured positions), and the initial water level condition. The data set for the modeling and validation are from different irrigation seasons. The least accurate model, which is still very useful, is the St-Venant model where the model parameters are not tuned to the actual pool but guestimated based on a rule of thumb. The response is the dashed line in Fig. 6. This model is by no means disgraced. The other St-Venant model has its parameters (a model for the friction was adjusted) optimally selected based on field observations. Its response is dash–dot line in Fig. 6. These models are compared against a grey box model that uses a third order model, (leaky) integrator and standing waves and a first order grey box model that only captures the (leaky) integrator trends. The grey box models have been identified from open-loop experiments. All models are reasonably accurate. From a simulation perspective, the best model, based on quality for effort, is the third order grey box model. For control purposes the first order grey box model will suffice, when the wave phenomena are appropriately considered in the closed loop design (Weyer, 2003a). 3.3. Automated model building Given the size of a typical irrigation system automated model building and model maintenance is essential. Model maintenance must be performed within the constraints imposed by normal management conditions. As demonstrated in (Ooi & Weyer, 2001) the grey box model (4) allow for simple calibration of the parameters under closed loop conditions. A few hours of data, using permitted changes in the water level reference set points, exploiting the available dead band, suffices to tune the model parameters. Such variation is allowed under normal operating conditions as the typical dead band for the set point regulation is of the order of 10 cm (under manual operation, water levels were deemed acceptably regulated when less than 30 cm away from set points). Fig. 7 taken from (Ooi & Weyer, 2001)compares a validation data set (black solid line) with a simulation (dotted line) based on a model derived from closed loop data. Only 90 min of closed loop data with minimal set point variations were used to derive the relevant parameters of a first order grey box model (4) that sufficed for control design purposes. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 7. Validating closed loop system identification, using grey box models. It is important to notice that the tuning of the model for a particular pool is inherently a decentralized task. It involves only data gathered from the up-stream and down-stream regulators. Given the available compute engines at the various monitoring sites a model update can be performed locally using peer-to-peer communications. Once the modeling or model maintenance is completed, the new model parameters can be communicated to the central node, which requires very little communication resources, as it only involves a few coefficients to be updated. In case of hardware failures (Choy & Weyer, 2005), like a regulator break-down, or sensor failure, an alarm is raised that also triggers a model update (and if necessary a control law update) to reflect the new dynamics. A model for an entire irrigation system is constructed from the logical interconnection of the individual pool models. 3.4. An open modeling issue The apparent data-based validation of both a St-Venant partial differential equation model and a low order grey box model within the present context poses an interesting and open question in model order reduction Besancon et al., 2001, Litrico and Fromion, 2004, Litrico et al., 2003. Under what conditions and in what sense can the grey box model (4) be considered as an approximation for the coupled partial differential equation model (1) and (2). This question is not only of academic interest. The basic parameters in the grey box model have a physical meaning, the dominant time constant, the wave period and time-delay are all related to the behaviour of the St-Venant equations. If the relationship between the St-Venant equations and the grey box model is better understood it may be possible to derive a simple map, a rule of thumb, linking physical parameters like pool length, critical velocity, Manning coefficient (an important parameter describing the friction losses in open channel flow) to a reasonable first guess for the coefficients in the grey box model. At present such a map is essentially being constructed from experience. An answer to the above open problem would provide a sound theoretical basis for such a rule of thumb. The question is not trivial in that even taking into account that the water levels are reasonably tightly controlled the St-Venant Eq. (2) remain highly nonlinear due to their nonlinear dependence on the flow. Hence classical model order reduction techniques do not apply. The situation is a nonlinear version of the classical lumped parameter Pi and T-section approximations used in electrical power engineering to represent a transmission line. Transmission line equations are linear St-Venant equations. 3.5. On-line model uses The need for a low complexity model structure like the grey box model cannot be argued solely on the basis of simulation or control design requirements. Indeed simulation and most control design techniques only use the model in an off-line capacity in which complexity plays a lesser role. (In the course of this project we have as yet not pursued model predictive control ideas for which low complexity models are definitely an advantage.) The model is used in the supervisory control to determine the limits of physical capability of the irrigation system to meet demand. Off-line an approximate table can be constructed that indicates which demand can be met in real time, but it is simpler and more accurate to actually calculate from the present state of the model forward to verify that the physical constraints can be satisfied (the present scheduling policy works on a first come first served basis). The model has however far more important on-line uses, which justify a low order complexity model. The main on-line use of the model is in fault detection and fault isolation. The single most valuable use of the model in this respect is the identification in real-time of leaks, which are identified and localized, as a (significant) difference between water levels predicted by the model and actually achieved water levels as measured by the sensors. The development of fault detection methods that exploit the full capabilities of the model and sensory data is ongoing. 4. Control for irrigation systems In the following discussion, consider a series of in-line pools (see Fig. 5), and assume overshot gates at the regulators. Other approaches, not discussed here, for control of canals can be found in Halleux et al., 2003, Malaterre and Baume, 1998, Schuurmans et al., 1999. From a control perspective, and to simplify the discussion, the predictive models discussed above can be further simplified. Indeed, as the wave dynamics of the pools are not to be excited, because the free space in the canals above the water level is not designed to cope with standing waves, this part of the model may be ignored for control design as long as the design ensures that the waves are not going to be excited. The main wave frequency from the model is thus an important input into the control design process, it determines the bandwidth of the closed loop system. With this simplification, and introducing appropriate scaling and some abuse of notation, the pool dynamics, represented in continuous time, are given by (5) The index irefers to the regulator i, . The are the input variables, which are actually nonlinear functions of the gate positions and the water levels at the regulator. This representation globally linearises the non-linear behaviour of the canal; although the inputs are constrained in that . The disturbance is the total water off-take from pool i (upstream of regulator and downstream from regulator i). As discussed above, it is (almost) a measurable disturbance, although some aspects of the off-take term cannot be measured directly. Evaporation, seepage and unscheduled off-takes caused by bank erosion or bank collapse are clearly difficult to measure directly. The evaporation and seepage are only a small fraction of the total off-take, and the unscheduled off-takes can be identified from the model. The simplest control objective is to ensure that (no outflow at the bottom regulator) and that all are regulated to their reference values , (within a deadband). In this case, setpoint regulation automatically delivers water on demand, provided that in steady state demand is within the capacity constraint, that is for all . 4.1. Decentralised Control A decentralized control design is discussed in detail in (Weyer, 2002) see also (Li, Cantoni, & Weyer, 2005). The main features are that the upstream regulator input is used to regulate the water level based on information that is available at the down stream regulator and the local regulator i as well as the measured off-take on the pool i. The controller can thus be implemented using a peer-to-peer communication session. is set to zero. Assuming (perhaps incorrectly) that the off-take is measurable, the decentralized control law takes the form: (6) Here, and . is the feed forward control part and implements local feedback. This leads to the closed loop being described by (7) with and and (8) This representation shows clearly how disturbances propagate upstream; affects all for . The decentralised design is by necessity a trade-off between how much the local disturbance is rejected from the water level and how these disturbances propagate upstream, the effect on for . The transfer function governing the upstream propagation of disturbances is (9) the local rejection is governed by (10) The critical element in these transfer functions is the delay. A similar argument can be developed for when the off-take is not measurable. In this case, the control law takes the form (11) starting with . The corresponding closed loop is described by the iteration ( ) (12) which describes the regulator inputs and (13) which describes the error-propagation. Here, (14) and (15) 4.2. Decentralised control, without off-take measurements When the off-takes may not be measured, the feedback must include an integrator in order to reject the off-take disturbances . This makes the control design much more challenging as the plant also contains an integrator. In the presence of a double integrator and having to contend with the unavoidable delay in the transfer functions , , and (see Eqs. (9), (10), (14), (15)), it can be shown that is now impossible to avoid that water levels errors are amplified as they propagate upstream along the canal. In (Li et al., 2005), it is demonstrated that for any linear (stable) design . The way to arrive at a good design is to achieve strong disturbance rejection by way of ensuring that . In this way, even very long chains of pools can be adequately controlled.2 The design proceeds in two phases, first stability/robustness is guaranteed for the local pool dynamics (design emphasis on ); a phase margin of about 40∘ and a gain margin of about 10 dB is considered adequate. A feedback consisting of a PI controller, with low pass filter as to avoid the excitation of the wave dynamics, i.e. , can achieve this goal. The feed forward term is essentially a low pass filter, again to ensure that waves are not excited. Moreover, the feed forward term must be designed with care to avoid the amplification of disturbances along the canal. To complete the design, the control objectives are verified against the entire system dynamics. This boils down to the non-trivial verification of the transfer functions . Figs. 8, Fig. 9, Fig. 10 illustrate the response of the decentralized controller (PI + filter) under a control test scenario on one of the main canals. The set point is the dash–dot line and the solid line is the recorded water level realized by the controller. Several set point changes and disturbances occur over the period of time (a bit more than a day’s worth of data is displayed). The controller maintains the water level to better than 5 cm.

Field data showing the decentralised control in action, PI with feedforward. 4.3. Decentralised control with off-take measurements Assuming that the off-takes are measured, it is possible to use a simple lead–lag controller in the feedback path ( ) and a simple low pass filter in the feed forward path. The design is somewhat simplified in this situation as compared to the design based on the integrator in the feedback path. The only relevant transfer functions are and , which makes it indeed somewhat easier to achieve acceptable gain and phase margins as well as disturbance rejection. The main design problem concerns the feed forward action, as this dominates the error propagation along the canals. As the design is only marginally easier than the PI based design, the PI based design, which has greater robustness with respect to off-takes, is to be preferred. 4.4. Centralised control Based on the model (5) linear quadratic methods as well as design methods may be pursued to deliver a global controller see Li et al., 2004, Li et al., 2005, Weyer, 2003c. These serve as benchmarks for the decentralized controllers. The information infrastructure briefly discussed above does not enable one to implement a central control strategy across an entire irrigation district. Linear quadratic, centralised controllers have been field tested in smallish irrigation systems. Besides serving as a benchmark for the decentralized controllers, a centralized control law can be used to derive an acceptable decentralized controller, through pruning the weaker input–output connections. To complete an adequate linear quadratic design it is essential to augment the state of the system (water levels ) with the integrals of the regulation errors ( ) and states to describe high pass filtered input variables (emphasizing the frequency content above the standing wave frequency of the pool that can be effected by the particular input variable). The latter are essential to avoid excitation of standing waves in the pools. A linear quadratic design completed along these lines provides an overall responsiveness better than what can be achieved using the above decentralized controller, with acceptable robustness properties. The design process is however much more demanding. In particular the selection of the quadratic weights so as to achieve an intuitively acceptable response is a time-consuming task. The intuition derived from the decentralized controller can be used to better advantage in an design. The decentralized controller can be used to deliver the loop shaping that is required to achieve a high gain in the low frequency band (to reject the load disturbances), a 20 dB/dec roll off around the cross over frequency (which is limited by the wave frequency) to achieve sufficient phase margin, and faster roll-off around and beyond the wave frequencies. Using the decentralized controller to guide the selection of the loop shaping frequency dependent weights, allows the design method to deliver a very robust and high performing controller that satisfies all control requirements. The resulting controller is a global controller, with a performance similar to a well designed linear quadratic controller. The advantage is that the design effort is much smaller than what is required for the linear quadratic controller, and entirely comparable to the decentralized controller. Field tests are planned for the near future. 4.5. A law of diminishing returns In order to appreciate the benefit that may be derived from the various control scenarios, a comparison is made between: • manual control, the present situation, where water orders are averaged, and water regulation is effected once every 24 h by manually adjusting the regulator structures. • decentralized control, without feed forward; PI + filter design using a simple anti-windup scheme. • decentralized control, with feed forward; PI + filter design using a simple anti-windup scheme. • global, centralized control (using a linear quadratic regulator). The comparison is based on a three-pool simulation, where the scenarios have been implemented on an equal footing. All control implementations encounter identical circumstances. The scenario stretches over a 9-day period. It involves: • A water order cancellation. Half-way through the simulation, a water order (45 h long order of 37,500 m3) is cancelled. Farmers can order water, typically 4 days in advance, but are allowed to cancel the order with only one hour notice. This is a very demanding scenario from a manual regulation point of view, but realistic. • A 2.5-cm rain event that last for 10 h. Under rain conditions, farmers are allowed to stop irrigation. This leads to an emergency stop of the irrigation system, which is virtually impossible to control well under manual operations. • Ten normal water orders, of various length and magnitude. The water orders are organized as per typical manual operations, so as to create a situation advantageous for manual operations. The scenario is illustrated in Fig. 11, in which the head over the most upstream regulator is indicated. This illustrates the water supply into the canal, which is the main control action to implement the down stream requested water orders. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 11. Water supply over a 9 day period into an irrigation canal. The results are that any of the automated methods achieve all the water orders as requested and avoid spilling water during the rain condition. The decentralized control strategies achieve 100% water efficiency in that no water is spilled over the most down stream regulator. The linear quadratic regulator controller achieves quicker and better water level regulation (barely noticeable) and an overall efficiency of 99%. (The LQ regulator sacrifices a minimal amount of water in favour of achieving a better water level regulation.) Of course this is not the whole story, nevertheless this particular simulation study suggests that there is little incentive to implement a centralized control strategy. The corresponding water level response in the most down stream pool is illustrated in Fig. 12. This pool is the most difficult to manage well under manual control. Typically the bottom end of the irrigation system experiences poor quality of service under manual operations. The same Figure illustrates that using the decentralized controllers there is saturation during the rain event (regulators are closed) and at the end of the irrigation period, when there is a small excess of water supply without outflow. This water supplied in excess is stored in the most down stream pool. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 12. Waterlevel response in the most downstream pool. Under manual operations, the overall efficiency was 80% (which is very good compared to historical averages, typical best practice manual operation achieves an efficiency of about 70%). The quality of service is however poor, despite the fact that the water orders were placed as to be advantageous to manual control. Only 90% of the water orders is met. The water levels dropped below the minimum required to satisfy the requested demand over about 10% of the total duration. Moreover, during the rain period, the most down stream pool flooded its banks for about a day. The rain period only lasted for 10 h, but there was a significant water flow imbalance at the beginning of the rain period, which together with the slow response of manual control, aggravated the rain effect to cause significant flooding. To observe substantial differences between the different forms of automated, real-time, irrigation management, larger canal systems must be compared. Various scenarios have been simulated, and it quickly becomes clear that decentralized control with feed forward (and anti-windup) achieves near global optimal performance. In most scenarios its performance cannot be distinguished from centralized control (which cannot be implemented) and it is substantially better than the decentralized control without feed forward. The latter suffers from a larger variation in water levels, and cannot always supply water orders as requested because water levels fall below the agreed minimum supply point. 4.6. Implementation issues There are two main implementation issues to contend with: sampling and saturation. As pointed out, the information infrastructure does not allow for regular sampling. Globally sampling is performed on an event basis (e.g. only the time that a water level changes by 2 cm up or down is reported), although locally, at each site regular sampling is performed. The decentralized controller does not suffer, as it only uses local information. A global controller must be designed as to cope with rather varying information rates and delays across the range of variables it requires to compute the control inputs. Substantial further research work is necessary. This issue is at the heart of so called network control. An alternative approach to communication limited control is exposed in for example (Nair, Evans, Mareels, & Moran, 2004), where an information theoretic point of view is pursued. The latter identifies the minimum data rates required to achieve stability. It turns out that in the case at hand, as the instability in the plant is limited to a chain of integrators that any non-zero communication rate suffices to achieve stability. Of course, this does not imply good performance, but it indicates that the required communication cannot be demanding. This is in-line with the present engineering solution and experience. Saturation issues can be addressed using anti-windup control ideas. The design can be completed, and consequently adapted as to ensure smooth feedback without integrator saturation Zaccarian et al., 2004, Zaccarian et al., 2004. Simple anti-windup control is implemented. 4.7. Open issues There are a number of interesting open aspects from a theoretical point of view that have received little attention in the control literature. In particular, event-based sampling and disturbance propagation in the irrigation system require further work. The latter is made difficult because of the combination of marginally stable open loop dynamics combined with delays. Although no single pool dynamics is dominated by delay effects, the concatenation of many similar systems in a tree like structure makes this an interesting and difficult problem, see Li et al., 2004, Li et al., 2005 for first results in the case of a string of identical pools. This work addresses the worst case scenario. What is important is to understand the average case, where there is a certain (natural) distribution of delays and pool dynamics. The key ingredient in understanding the propagation of disturbances through the system is to understand the role of the feed forward control in balancing the requirement for providing information to speed up the response, and yet limiting this information so as not to amplify the disturbances. Another interesting open problem that has received not enough attention in the control literature is to determine an appropriate structure for a decentralized controller. This is a problem of determining the appropriate information structure for control design, or which inputs/outputs are best paired with each other. As, the number of different decentralized controller structures is combinatorially large, exhaustive evaluation is simply not feasible, hence relevant heuristics should be developed. One ad hoc solution method, exploited in the present work, is to use sequential minimum variance (Weyer, 2003b), based on a particular ordering of the variables to be regulated. Another is to start from a global centralized control design, and to prune the input-output connections based on an appropriate singular value decomposition. In the present application, both approaches lead rather quickly to the proposed solution method. In sequential minimum variance, the ordering of the variables that leads to the above decentralized controller structure is to place the highest priority on the outflow , next the most down stream water level , then the next water level and so on. 5. Discussion Systems engineering principles as discussed here have been implemented in support of irrigation system management in a number of pilot projects in Victoria, Australia, with excellent outcomes in terms of achieved overall water savings and quality of service: water distribution efficiency of better than 90% (essentially only the unremovable losses due to evaporation and seepage remain), compared to 70% achieved under manual operations; combined with an ability to meet water requests on-demand in better than 90% of all water orders. All of this is achieved together with much better regulation accuracy, which improves the quality of service to the customers in a significant way. On the basis of these outcomes large scale implementation in Victoria has commenced. The white paper on water released by the State Government of Victoria identified that the implementation of advanced control, along the lines expounded here, will save about 400 Mm3of water per year when completed across all of the irrigation districts in Victoria. This volume of savings nearly equals the total annual water consumption for all domestic and industrial use in the State of Victoria. This figure is based on a conservative extrapolation of the actually achieved water savings in the pilot projects to date (only need to achieve half the success achieved in the pilot projects thus far). Similar studies conducted in a New South Wales report even greater saving potentials (The Business of Saving Water—the Report of the Murrumbidgee Valley Water Efficiency Project, n.d.). The economic benefits that can be derived from such water savings initiatives are immense. The (The Business of Saving Water—the Report of the Murrumbidgee Valley Water Efficiency Project, n.d.)report indicates economic benefits in the order of $500 M when a water saving target of 1 Gm3 would be realised. An important outcome of the information infrastructure is that management, and indeed the community at large, can be much better informed about the capabilities of the irrigation system; how much water was used, when and where it was used. Already, changes in the way irrigators use water can be observed, as a more responsive distribution system enables them to use more water efficient on-farm practices. This results in even more water savings or better economic returns for the farmers. The present positive results encourage the expansion of the research and development ideas to consider other aspects of water distribution, on-farm as well as urban. The outcomes realized are a small step towards the goal set forth in the UNESCO Water Report (2003) that fresh water management must happen on the scale of entire water catchments.

  Main Objective: To investigate the potential of using soil permittivity measurements for closed-loop control of irrigation and fertilization.
  Study Location: Unspecified
  Data Sources: Laboratory lysimeter experiments with sandy loam and loess soils
  Technologies Used: Time domain (TDR-) and frequency domain (FD-) sensors for measuring soil permittivity
  Key Findings: The real part of soil permittivity can provide feedback signals for irrigation control, while the imaginary part can be used to assess soil salinity and control fertilizer application. The imaginary part of permittivity is influenced by the pore water conductivity, which is strongly correlated with the plant-available nitrogen content in soil. By correcting salinity measurements for soil moisture variations, a reliable estimate of plant-available nutrients can be obtained.
  Extract 1: "By measuring the complex permittivity of soil, feedback signals can be achieved for both water and fertiliser input... The imaginary part of soil permittivity is related to the conductivity of the bulk soil, the three phase mixture of air, water and particles."
  Extract 2: "Lysimeter experiments with rape demonstrated that by measuring the complex permittivity, the actual amount of salts available to the crop could be mapped quite clearly, when the salinity measurements were corrected to salinity values at constant soil moisture (here: to values at field capacity)."
  Limitations: The study is limited to laboratory lysimeter experiments and may not directly translate to real-world field conditions. The accuracy and reliability of the permittivity measurements under varying soil conditions and environmental factors need further evaluation. Additionally, the algorithms for correcting salinity values based on soil moisture need to be optimized for different soil types and cropping systems.
  Relevance Evaluation: This study is highly relevant to the point in your literature review about exploring the concept of closed-loop control in autonomous irrigation systems. The paper provides a detailed investigation of how complex permittivity measurements can be utilized to achieve closed-loop control of both irrigation and fertilization, addressing the need for real-time feedback signals in these processes. The findings demonstrate the practical feasibility and potential benefits of using permittivity-based sensors for advanced irrigation management.

  Explanation: This study focused on the potential applications of soil permittivity measurements for closed-loop irrigation and fertilizer management. The researchers demonstrated that by measuring the complex permittivity (real and imaginary parts) of soil, they could obtain feedback signals for both water and fertilizer input. Specifically, the real part of permittivity was found to be closely related to volumetric water content, while the imaginary part was influenced by the pore water conductivity, which could be used to assess soil salinity and plant-available nitrogen.

It is well known that the real part of soil permittivity is closely connected to the volumetric water content. So sensors based on this principle are available for controlling irrigation. For controlling fertilisation, a newer development is the assessment of the pore water conductivity by measuring also the imaginary part of the soil permittivity. Washout experiments have shown that this ‘salinity’ (the pore water conductivity, based on the ion concentration in the plant available water) is mostly influenced by nitrate ions under agricultural circumstances. Lysimeter experiments with rape demonstrated that by measuring the complex permittivity, the actual amount of salts available to the crop could be mapped quite clearly, when the salinity measurements were corrected to salinity values at constant soil moisture (here: to values at field capacity). In conclusion, it is shown that a controlled fertilisation can be as straightforward as controlling irrigation. The only difference is the much greater time constant. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Complex permittivitySoil moistureSoil salinityIrrigationFertilisationLysimetry 1. Purpose and approach Water and fertiliser are important inputs into plant production. Due to natural influences (type of soil, climate, crop growth, etc.) there are considerable variations in the ability of the soil to supply water and fertiliser over time. So for controlling irrigation and fertilisation, real time feedback signals on soil state are needed. The overall aim of this paper is to achieve and to test signals characterising soil, in order to facilitate the above management actions. The signals should describe the water content and the nutritional state of the test site. Because sensors are the bottleneck in most control schemes for agricultural production processes, such investigations are a key to improve management. Closed loop control or minimisation procedures may then be developed straightforwardly. As the characterising signal the complex permittivity (=dielectric constant) of soil has been chosen. Techniques for measuring the soil permittivity include time domain (TDR-) sensors and frequency domain (FD-) sensors, see Noborio (2001) and Dirksen and Hilhorst (1994). For volumetric water content, various manufacturers offer appropriate sensors based on measuring the real part of permittivity. Recently a sensor had been developed and evaluated in an European project (Balendonck et al., 1998) to measure both, the real and imaginary part of permittivity. The real part of soil permittivity is known to depend strongly on its water content and is therefore suited for irrigation systems. Various authors, including Balendonck et al. (1998) have shown the possibilities of these sensors in a complete water control system. The imaginary part of the permittivity is related to the conductivity of the bulk soil, the three phase mixture of air, water and particles. Hilhorst (2000) has deduced that by measuring both the real and the imaginary part of permittivity (=bulk soil conductivity), the electrical conductivity (EC) of the pore water (=salinity) in soil can be computed. The salinity computed in this way expresses the ion concentration in the pore water, which is available for plants. In agricultural soils, nitrate is one of the most active and movable ions. So if ion conductivity can be measured, the next question is, whether the nitrate ion is the main influence on the salinity measurement. Further, it must be investigated whether the salinity values are influenced by the amount of diluting water in the soil pores. If so, then by taking the soil moisture (=volumetric water content) into account, the suitability of the humidity corrected ‘salinity’ as information for a controlled fertiliser application is to be tested. The objective of this paper is to study the correlations between the signals of permittivity and the actual states of water and fertiliser in soil. If there are strong correlations, continuous measurement in soil will open new possibilities for controlled agriculture. In particular, if fertilisation rates can be determined as simply as irrigation rates, new possibilities of controlling water and fertiliser application can be contemplated. 2. Methods 2.1. Lysimeter set-up To provide the basis for a control scheme applicable to irrigation and fertilisation, three lysimeters of 1 m height and 50 cm diameter were installed. The tests in these laboratory lysimeters were intended to provide information on the behaviour of the above processes in soil. Two lysimeters contained different soils, i.e. sandy loam and loess, artificially filled with A and B horizons. The third lysimeter was equipped with original grassland (sandy loam). Sensors were imbedded for continuous measurements of both real and imaginary permittivity (water content and EC), together with tensiometers for measuring the water tension and with temperature sensors. Measurements were taken automatically every 20 min at three depths: 10, 50 and 90 cm each. Rape was chosen as the crop, because it is known to have strong, deep-going roots. It is therefore well suited to generate a dry deep layer and, by this, to guarantee no fertiliser or water transport beyond that barrier. Irrigation and fertilisation were carried out manually with weighed amounts. The experimental set-up is shown in Fig. 1. Beside these 1 m lysimeters, for preliminary tests regarding the washout process and the ionic concentration in the drainage water six small lysimeters of 15 cm diameter as shown in Fig. 2 were used. They were filled with different soils to a height of ∼20 cm. At the beginning the soil was rinsed with tap water (EC=0.1 mS/cm). Then fertiliser was dissolved and applied to the surface of the wet soil columns, corresponding to 30, 60 or 90 kg N/ha. In the following weeks the soils were irrigated regularly every 2 or 3 days (depending on weekend) with ∼1/3 of their free water according to field capacity (≈200 ml). With each addition of water, fertiliser was washed through the soil column. The drainage water was collected after every watering event and measured for EC and nitrate.

Set-up for comparison of salinity in soil with EC in washout water (FD, frequency domain sensor). 2.2. Real permittivity and water content For measuring the amount of water in soil, the real part of the bulk dielectric constant (real permittivity ε′) is known to be well suited. Practical instruments based on measurements in the time or at constant frequencies are offered by various providers. A new development on the standing-wave ratio (Sun et al., 1999) is promising. Unfortunately, the permittivity is not only dependent on the soil moisture, but also on temperature, density and on the type of soil. So each soil has to be calibrated. For sandy soils, often an approximation by Topp et al. (1980) is taken: (1) Newer developments (Paul et al., 1998) have shown that a self-calibration is also possible to a certain extent, when measuring over different frequencies (here 10, 20 and 30 MHz) and taking dispersion into account. Moreover, when evaluating this ‘Maxwell–Wagner effect’, the soil type can also be identified. 2.3. Imaginary permittivity and electrical conductivity of pore water The imaginary part of soil permittivity ε″ is at frequencies low with respect to relaxation mainly influenced by the bulk soil conductivity (σbulk). The bulk soil conductivity is a function of the volumetric water content Θ and its ionic conductivity (ECwater or σwater). Conductivity of the free pore water (available for plants) is usually taken as a measure of soil salinity, because this conductivity is based only on the ionic concentration. As shown by Hilhorst (1998) and Hilhorst (2000), the ionic conductivity of the soil solution can be expressed by the measurable values of the complex permittivity of the bulk soil as (2) with σb=2pfε0εb″ as ionic bulk conductivity, at constant frequencies only dependent on the imaginary part of the bulk soil permittivity. The index w is the water stands for the water extractable from soil, the index b is the bulk denotes a measurement in bulk soil. The factor F is ∼1 in wet soil and εb dry can be measured with values between 3.5 and 8, depending on soil texture. As standard a value of 5 is taken. According to Eq. (2), σwater, the ionic conductivity of the soil solution available for plants, is so calculated from the simultaneously measured real and imaginary part of the permittivity of bulk soil (right part of Eq. (2)). 3. Preliminary measurements Preliminary measurements in the small lysimeters shown in Fig. 2 were made to compare the calculated salinity with the measured EC-value in the drainage water. The volumetric water content and the bulk conductivity of the soil were measured in the upper soil layer (5 cm). From these values the salinity of the soil was computed. The tests were done in various soils, here shown by the example of sandy loam. Of these lysimeters, three columns had normal density, in the other three columns a formerly treated soil (some residues of urea lead later on to deviations in nitrate concentration) was artificially compacted. Fig. 3 shows the development of EC and nitrate in drainage water compared to EC in soil and to salinity (EC in pore water). During each leaching a constant amount of ∼1/3 of the free water in soil was replaced. So the salts were washed out, appearing with some time delay in the drainage water. Because EC and nitrate in drainage water are developing in parallel, it seems obvious, that salinity measurements under agricultural circumstances were mostly influenced by the nitrate content. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Development of salinity and accompanying values. If in soil the water replacement behaved as an ideal piston flow, after four irrigations the initial concentration at the surface would be washed through the column and would appear in the drainage water. As could be expected, the soil matrix retards the transition process. Because the EC values of the bulk soil were small and varied very little, they are omitted in the further discussion. The concentration is on the development of salinity, which is decreasing constantly as a result of the washout process. From Fig. 3 the following Fig. 4 was deduced, where the maximum salinities in both soil types are recorded. It shows that the amount of fertiliser applied is closely related to the salinity measurements in the upper soil layer. At low fertiliser input (30 kg N/ha) the reading in the compacted soil is topped by the urea residues, producing nitrate to a considerable amount by bacterial action. Given a known soil, the salinity corresponds to the actual fertiliser (mainly nitrate) state. This can also seen by the development of salinity in Fig. 5 during another leaching process, where also the amount of potassium (<1/10th of nitrate!) in the drainage water was recorded.

Main experiments and discussion On the basis of the preliminary measurements, feedback simulations on irrigation and fertilisation were conducted in the 1 m indoor lysimeters. In these lysimeters rape was grown on sandy loam and on loess. During the test, no drainage occurred and the soil moisture varied according to water inputs and evapotranspiration. The irrigation was applied in doses of 4 mm (=1 l/lysimeter) or multiples of it (8 or 12 mm). 4.1. Controlled irrigation The experiment started with saturated, bare soil in the lysimeters. The total course of soil moisture over time in terms of volumetric water content is given in Fig. 6. The initial drying out at ∼18 °C with no crop was slow and therefore is not included here. The lysimeters were seeded with rape at the end of August. By October the crop had enough leaf area to transpire considerable amounts of water. Also a drying of deeper layers began, hinting that the crop had enough roots to reach all available water. In the middle of October, when the upper layer was completely dried out (10% or 500 kPa), a controlled irrigation dependent on actual state began. In November the upper soil layer was kept in a reasonably wet condition by manually controlled water inputs at a refill point of 20% soil moisture. The middle layer was held between 10 and 15% moisture, whereas the lowest layer further dried out continuously. At the end of the experiment (flowering of the rape) this development was still going on. The plants had been supplied with water to keep the upper layer at optimal moisture between 10 and 50 kPa, the deeper dry layer had developed up to dry 200 kPa. The figure also shows the time constants of the top, middle and deep layers. Whereas the surface layer reacts immediately to irrigation, the time constants in deeper layers are enormous. Basically, this picture is true for the other soil types. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 6. Two point regulation of water content in the upper layer. It is interesting to compare the water tension and the water content during the simulated management of irrigation, because water tension is often said to be the better signal for irrigation. A daily water application of 1 l (=4 mm) or 2 l, depending on volumetric water content during the week, was combined with mostly 4 l during weekends. Fig. 6 shows that a classical 2 point controller, based on volumetric water content as measured by real permittivity, acting when the refill point of 20% is reached, can readily keep the optimum moisture at around tensions between 20 and 40 kPa or water contents between 20 and 25% in the upper layer. Even greater time intervals with no water input (weekends) can easily be processed. The moisture at 50 cm depth is held between 12 and 15% or 40 and 80 kPa. The wetter values are following the wetter conditions at the top with a considerable time lag. The drying out of the lowest layer was still underway at the end of recording. The experiment was repeated some months later (Fig. 7). It was started with a very shallow water table at 1 m depth, which caused quite a wet soil. On 18th January the shallow water table was removed, and the soil dried out. At the end of January, irrigation began. As before, the amount of water again was given according to the actual volumetric water content. By measuring at different depths also the development of a dry layer beneath the root zone and so the minimisation of water usage can be seen. Fig. 7 shows this irrigation according to soil moisture measurements (here in terms of tensions) and a manually simulated two point controller with weekend variations beginning on 1st February. As above, in the long run the deeper layer dried out. With a controlled irrigation there was no difficulty in holding the preset conditions in the root zone, in terms of tension between 0 and 40 kPa. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 7. Controlled irrigation of rape after removing shallow water table. 4.2. Controlled fertilisation As salinity is strongly influenced by plant available nitrogen (results reported above), then fertiliser can be applied according to demand. Advanced strategies such as minimum pollution via washout can be implemented. Experiments were carried out in the 1 m lysimeters filled with sandy loam and loess and growing rape. The salinities according to Eq. (2) are given in Fig. 8. Surprisingly, the expected increase in salinity following the fertilising event with 90 kg N/ha on 1st February could not be seen. The only steps to be seen are the decreases at the irrigation events, started on the same day. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 8. Salinity as computed to Eq. (2). Clearly, when a given amount of salts is in solution, the concentration and therefore the salinity changes with the amount of diluting water. So the salinity values have to be corrected for soil moisture variations. To do this, both an extra drying processes and an evaluation of the measured values in the lysimeters were carried out. Fig. 9 shows the development of the salinity during concentration due to drying in two small lysimeters with sandy loam. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 9. Salinity over volumetric water content. ■=lysimeter 1, ×=lysimeter 2. Taking the salinity values of Fig. 8 and relating them to the measured soil moistures, here expressed as tensions, this dependence can also be seen in Fig. 10. In soil, the processes are complicated (beginning with cation exchange, ending with microbiology) and partly unknown. However, from Fig. 9, Fig. 10 and the assumption that for some days the total change in salts including nitrate was limited (no washout, little plant uptake), a linear or a mild polynomial correction for the salinity can be considered. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 10. Salinity over water tensions. A linear relation to a wet soil basis at field capacity was chosen. All salinity values (S) were then corrected. The linear correction formulas given empirically by Fig. 9 or Fig. 10 with tension h measured in kPa are (3) (4) With these corrected salinities, a clear response to plant uptake and fertilisation is obtained (Fig. 11). In January, the salinity in the upper soil layer decreased in both the sandy loam and the loess type of soils, due to plant uptake. On 1st February the effects of fertiliser applied equivalent to 90 kg N/ha (given as a full fertiliser), can be seen. Whereas in sandy loam a sharp increase occurred, in loess, with its buffer capacity, a smaller step was followed by a further increase. In both cases, after ∼2 weeks continued growth, the supply began to diminish. After ∼5 weeks the soil was depleted and nearly the same salinities were reached as immediately before fertilising. The original supply was taken up by the plants, and the next application of fertilising salts was necessary to avoid nutritional stress. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 11. Salinity, corrected for wet soils. Based on the possibility to measure and compute the plant available salinity (mainly nitrate content in pore water), strategies for fertilising can be deduced. In the example of the lysimeter experiments with rape in sandy loam and loess, the decrease in salinity due to plant uptake can be seen. When the refill point is reached, the fertiliser can be applied. An increase in salinity (in sandy loam a step) after fertilisation and the following decrease because of further plant uptake is apparent in the upper soil layer (10 cm depth). After 1 month, the amount of fertiliser applied has been taken up. The next dosage can be deduced according to measured values of moisture corrected salinity in order to fill up the fertiliser reservoir and to keep salinity in an optimal range. 5. Conclusions The simultaneous measurement of permittivity in soil in its real and imaginary part offers new possibilities for controlled irrigation and fertilisation. Regarding irrigation only, by continuously sampling data on real permittivity at various depths, the total amount of needed water can be deduced. Regarding fertilisation, by measuring the corrected soil salinities, the total amount of needed fertiliser can be assessed. So with measuring the complex permittivity, at least in lysimeter experiments, there is a feedback signal for the two most important inputs to plant production. In particular, the approach to controlled fertilisation based on measuring salinity is promising. The salinity expresses the ion concentrations (under agricultural conditions mainly nitrate ions) in the pore water, which are available for plants and which equals the amount of salts possibly washed out into deeper soil layers. To come to a controlled fertiliser application, a correction of the salinity values to the state in wet soils is proposed. These corrections can be calibrated for different soils. For practical application individual measurements may suffer from natural variabilities (Schmitz and Sourell, 2000). So a single point assessment would have clear limits in the above control context. But with multiple measurements and appropriate mean values a new approach is given not only for controlled irrigation but also for optimal plant nutrition or minimal pollution.

The control is used to manage the irrigations hours with the aim to reduce cost and increase plant growth performance. This unique control involves with loop signals through weather sensors which monitors the changes of weather condition. Three sensors namely temperature, humidity and pyranometer are used to provide signals that are known as multiplying factor for the control algorithm to perform autonomous adjustment for the next irrigation time. The algorithm involves with a constant K which is applied as time setting for daily irrigation. The time setting autonomously changed associated with the changes of weather such as dry climax, raining and hot weather.

Introduction Systems for the future will increasingly have the characteristics of the autonomous features. Autonomous is described as independent system which runs with minimum supervision. In this greenhouse application some parts of control are necessarily need autonomous features. This could enhance the capability of the system that would improve the environment for the healthy plants. Autonomous control is designed to perform for several functions as follow Monitoring intruder e.g. monkeys. Watering plants Solar Power control The new functions of the greenhouse was developed using small size of control board. The board is a readymade board with microcontroller 18F4250. It has 5 ports which are sufficient for small control application. Besides the board, additional peripheral circuits are also required to facilitate the monitoring functions such as Real time circuit (RTC), Humidity and Temperature sensor board and relay board. Configuration of the board and the supporting circuits is done through MicroC (compiler and debugger). In this article the focus is emphasized on autonomous control for irrigation system of greenhouse. Systematic Irrigation system is crucial for plantation particularly in tropical country. Tropical countries like Malaysia have extreme phenomena against heat and high temperature on day time. Over-heated through high ultra-violet could kill plants or promotes unhealthy growth. Vegetable plant requires wet condition and scheduled irrigation time is applied to ensure the plants are not dried. Irrigation through electronic timer is not sufficient and not cost effective. Many researchers also introduce soil monitoring through radio frequency to gather water contents of the soil [5] [10]. This technique is manned for monitoring a big plantation. However the limitation of this technique is the maintenance cost is high. The sensors are planted in the soil and transmits the soil information to the main controller. A new technique is proposed with different strategies in controlling the irrigation time. The mechanism of control is based on environment changes and feedback the changes to the algorithm for calculating the irrigation time. SECTION II. Autonomous Irrigation System Figure 1 shows the block diagram of the irrigation control system. The system involves with three environment sensors namely ultra violet sensor, humidity and temperature sensors. The sensors are used to measure the condition of the greenhouse and feedback the data to watering algorithm. Figure 1. Block diagram of autonomous watering system Show All The watering algorithm will process and calculate the data for determining the next irrigation time. In short to generate the next activation time first calibration, K is set to determine the regular hours for activation. Secondly the inputs from the three sensors are calculated to produce multiply factor for K. The result is used to add with the present activation time which then produce the next activation time. A. Parameters in the Algorithm One of the factors to promote healthy growth for plants is effective control watering system and humidity control level during day time. In tropical country temperature could rise up to 37°C during peak noon daily. This temperature level is not suitable for some vegetables plant that could reduce crop yield. Simple autonomous solution to monitor the temperature level is by using sensors and Real Time Device (RTC). One wire sensor SLTH1 is used in the system to measure two environment parameters namely humidity and temperature. Another sensor is pyranometer which is used to measure sun intensity. The control algorithm use feedback mechanism from the three sensors to decide the next activation time for water sprinkler. In general the process of control is explained as shown in Figure 2. Figure 2. Flowchart of irrigation hours Show All Measurements for the three parameters were carried out to generate the next activation time. Once the time has been obtained it will be added with RTC time to determine the actual Time for next activation. There are three values involved in weather measurement for Green House. First is temperature parameter. Temperature is induced from heat particularly from sun. During day time the heat is increased especially during noon time. The higher the heat the more water from soil is evaporated. As a result the higher frequency is required to watering the plants. Second parameter is humidity. Humidity is defined as percentage of water contents in air. Humidity is increasing after long raining and during night time. In green house, water in soil is evaporated faster when heat is increased. This causes humidity decreasing. In relation to watering frequency, the higher the value of humidity means less number of watering frequency is applied. Figure 3. Irradiance value for one day measurement Show All The third parameter in measurement is irradiance. Irradiance is a measurement of solar power and is defined as the rate at which solar energy falls onto a surface. The irradiance falling on a surface can and does vary from moment to moment. The range of irradiance is within 0 to 1.6 kw/m2. A typical calibration factor C of pyranometer can be expressed as: C=160 mV/(kw/ m 2 ) (1) View Source This value means that when the solar irradiance Ee is 1 kw/m2 (typical for a clear, sunny day around noon) the pyranometer will provide an output voltage around 160 mV. If the output voltage is found to be 80 mV, this indicates that the solar irradiance is about 0.5 kw/m2. Thus: Ee=V/C (2) View Source where V is the signal voltage in millivolts and Ee is measured in kw/m2. Normal day time at peak noon, irradiance is increased to 1.0 kw/m2. The higher the irradiance indicates the weather is dry and hot. Therefore the plants require more water per day. The range of irradiance is unique which becomes multiply factor for calculating the next activation hours. The minimum reading is zero that indicates night time while for day time it is slowly increased from 0 to 1.2 kw/m2 as shown in Figure 3. Apparently the total relation for the three parameters with time activation could be described as follow: Time Activation∝ Humidity Temperature∗Irradiance (3) View Source The equation can be further justified as Time Activation (H)=K∗ Humidity Temperature∗Irradiance    H=K∗ rh T∗Ee (4) View Source Where K is a constant which related to the coefficient factor for Time activation. The example of the calculation is shown as follow: E, g. During hot time temperature = 37°C, irradiance = 1.2 kw/m2, Humidity = 37 % K in tropical country → 1.2 (typical time setting value) H=1.2  ∗  37%/( 37 ∘ C  ∗  1.2)=1.0 or 1 hour 0 min View Source If the present time for activation is 10.00 am hence the next activation will be 11.00 am. E.g. During raining season temperature = 29°C, irradiance = 0.6 kw/m2, humidity = 60 % Hours=1.2  ∗  60%/( 29 ∘ C  ∗  0.6)=4.1 or 4 hour 6 min View Source If the present time for activation is 10.00 am hence the next activation will be 2.06 pm. B. Calibration K K is a constant which is used to set the average hours for activating sprinkler. The range of K is from 0 to 5 (in volt 0 to 5 Vdc). The value is dependent on the location of country and rain fall factor. In country which has low rain fall per year should apply low K to increase the frequency of watering. Activation algorithm will use constant K and weather data to calculate the suitable activation time for irrigation. There are two situations where system will autonomously do adjustment according to the sensor's measurement. When the weather is changing to dry and hot, the algorithm will calculate and shorten the next activation time for sprinkler. On the other hand when the weather is changing to raining, the system will calculate and increase the time for next activation. In the actual circuit K is set through simple potentiometer to produce constant analog voltage. Simple analog level would be 0 to 5 Vdc. A simple 3-Pot potential resistor (1KΩ) is used to vary the analog voltage. The analog voltage is applied to Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) of microcontroller for determining the digital value for K. The conversion of ADC extends the accuracy of the calibration as the output of the ADC is in binary number from 0 to 255. The algorithm for the simple calculation after ADC would be as follow: H= ADC 51 ∗ rh T∗Ee (5) View Source SECTION III. Measurement Exercise Measurement exercise was carried out from 1st Dec 2010 until 31st Jan 2011 with the aim to evaluate daily trend for temperature, humidity and irradiance. The location of the measurement was conducted at Templer, Rawang, Selangor. Rawang area is considered small industrial area and located nearby Genting Highlands. The weather is moderate at 20°C to 45°C throughout the year. The measurement graph as shown in Figure 6 is generated from EDM system [4]. The graph shows the combination of the three measurements: humidity, temperature and irradiance. The first day (31st Dec 2010) indicates heavy rain causes the temperature raised to 35°C max while the humidity reading is down to 54%. The irradiance is low 0.3 kw/m2 due to the sun was entirely covered by the heavy clouds. The next day (1st Jan 2011) was totally different weather condition where the sun was fully bright and this cause the irradiance swing to 1.2 kw/m2. SECTION IV. Sampling Time The graph of Figure 4 indicates that from the three parameters, humidity and temperature are consistent while irradiance has issue on cloudy which fluctuate the reading. There are several options to decide on sampling time for control algorithm. The first option is by taking 10 readings within 20 minutes and the highest value is chosen and used for the algorithm. The second option has similar method by taking 10 readings and an average for the 10 readings is used in the sampling time. After considering the actual effect of the cloudy condition which has minimum effect to the greenhouse condition, the first option is chosen. Therefore sampling time for checking the condition of greenhouse is 20 minutes and readings for humidity and temperature is taken for every 20 minutes while reading for irradiance is sampled for 10 times within 20 minutes. The highest values will be taken and used in the algorithm. SECTION V. Discussion Greenhouse project is a new concept of entrepreneurship for house owners in Malaysia. The project involves with the design structure of the greenhouse, control condition for plants, monitoring system, guarding system and etc. Part of the system such as Environment Management System (EDM) has been designed and presented [4]. Next the present works are related to autonomous control system for power management and irrigation system. System dependent with solar energy requires effective power management to ensure the system is running non-stop without battery failure. Autonomous control for irrigation is in very productive progress. The algorithm has been designed and formulated. The algorithm involves with a new concept of monitoring the soil's moisture. It uses weather changes that is being read by three environment sensors. The response is feedback to the control algorithm for calculating the new activation time. Techniques monitoring through planted soil sensor is rigid in terms of the maintenance work. The new concept using weather changes would improve the simplicity and it is very autonomous. Figure 5 and 6 show two days activation graph for two days data measurement. Both constant K have been set with 1.2. Day 1 indicates the transition of activation hour is linearly shorten from 9.00 am to 12.00 pm. After 12.00 pm the graph changes to irregularity condition where the transition of activation hours start to fluctuate. This condition was due to the inconsistent irradiance values. In daily condition, irradiance value is much affected by cloudy and raining. Day 2 (Figure 6) shows worst irregularity condition than day 1. Irregularities causes inconsistency in performing linear activation hours. What is the best solution to minimize the inconsistency issue? As suggested in Section IV the solution is by increasing the sampling time e.g. read 10 times irradiance values within 20 minutes (minimum time frame) before the algorithm pick up the maximum value. The maximum value apparently represents the actual value of irradiance. Other variables that also cause inconsistency such as short raining, tick cloudy and etc. could also be considered in the future for further improvement. In Figure 5 and 6 the straight line indicate the ideal values for irrigation hours. This linear response would help effective management of irrigation hours for greenhouse or big plantation. SECTION VI. Conclusion Irrigation system in tropical countries is crucial because it involves with cost and manpower. Tropical countries or two season countries weather have high rain fall a year and high temperature during daytime. High temperature is caused by heat from the sun and ultra violet ray. Therefore there are three parameters involved in determining the weather condition which are temperature, humidity and irradiance. The relation of the three parameters is interconnected and the changes are used to relate with irrigation hours. Simple algorithm for controlling irrigation hours comprise the three environment parameters and calibration K. The algorithm is based on loop or feedback measurement from weather sensors and the irrigation hours is respond to calculate the suitable hours for next activation of sprinkler system. Figure 4.

  Explanation: Closed-loop control is a self-regulating system that continuously monitors and adapts its output based on feedback from the system's environment. In the case of autonomous irrigation systems, closed-loop control can help to ensure that the system is watering the crops at the optimal time and with the optimal amount of water. This can lead to increased crop yields and reduced water usage.

Abstract:
The deployment of appropriate technologies to enhance 
modern agricultural practices and improve crop yields 
is imperative for sustainability. This paper presents the 
development of a standalone automated irrigation sys-
tem. The system design features good automation and 
control, which was achieved using an array of electronic 
timing system, soil feedback sensor and wireless commu-
nication system. Autonomous irrigation events are based 
on the states of the timing system, the soil feedback sys-
tem and the wireless communication system. The control 
and automation of these systems was done using an AVR 
microcontroller, which was programmed to trigger intelli-
gent and independent farm irrigation operation through 
a water pump attached to the system. The system also 
operates remotely via SMS command from mobile device 
and sends operational status feedback via SMS to pre-
programmed mobile user(s). It also sends soil moisture 
condition to a remote user upon query. The system pack-
age was produced using additive manufacturing tech-
nique. The power supply system was implemented using 
solar power system in order to achieve a standalone, 
autonomous and reliable power supply necessary for an 
independent operation. The performance evaluation of 
the developed system show impressive response time, 
good reliability and excellent stability. Furthermore, the 
numerical experiment conducted using the Response 
Surface Methodology (RSM) produced a mathematical 
model for the optimization of the irrigation process for 
optimum performance and cost effectiveness.

1. Introduction
The development of appropriate technologies in 
modern agricultural practices have not only improved 
crop yields but have also increased the ease with which 
farming practices are being done especially with the 
advent of robotic tools. With the increasing awareness 
and advocacy for round – the – year farming, and the 
need to meet up with the challenge of global food de-
mand, deploying appropriate technologies to increase 
productivity and reduce the burden often associated 
with farm practices has become inevitable. Since the 
role of agriculture in the economic development of any 
nation cannot be overemphasized, there is need boost 
agricultural productivity with the use of intelligent sys-
tems for increased food production and revenue gener-
ation [1–2]. One of such areas in agricultural practices 
that has posed much burden, wasted useful times and 
resources is farm irrigation. Irrigation is the artificial 
application of water to the land or soil which assist in 
the growing of agricultural crops, maintenance of land-
scapes, and revegetation of soils in dry areas as well 
as during periods of inadequate rainfall [3–5]. Mainly, 
there are two types of irrigation systems namely; sprin-
kler [6–7] and drip irrigation system [8–9]. The use of 
the sprinkler irrigation system involves the spraying 
of water into the air with the aid of a pumping system 
and sprinkler, which falls on the crops in form of small 
drops of water like the rain. It finds suitable applica-
tion in farm rows or fields either uniform or undulating 
[10]. On the other hand, the drip irrigation involves the 
passage of water directly to the root of plants from or 
below the soil surface using pipes or tubes. This form 
of irrigation is highly effective and conservative and 
most suitable in areas with acute shortage of water 
supply [11]. With regards to the challenges posed by 
conventional irrigation practices, the use of intelligent 
systems for irrigation are better appreciated particu-
larly with large-scale farming. Conventional methods 
of irrigation are labour intensive, time-consuming, 
relatively ineffective due to poor water distribution 
and lack of monitoring as well as smart control mech-
anisms [12–13]. Its over-reliance on human control 
makes it not suitable for large-scale farming [14–16]. 
Automatic irrigation systems on the contrary are nei-
ther laborious nor time-consuming and can help meet 
the ever increasing demand for food production all the 
year round [17–18]. In addition, the process is cost ef-
fective in the long run as the initial capital invested will 
be offset via large scale farming to meet the increasing 
demand for food production [19–20]. The burden the 
automated irrigation system seeks to resolve is the abil-
ity to intelligently and independently irrigate the farm 
environment. As such, farmers can commit the time 
hitherto wasted on prolonged and laborious manual 
irrigation to other productive tasks while the system 
independently executes the irrigation process. Accord-
ing to Ganturi [21] and Curtis [22], the requirements 
for a smart irrigation system includes the effective 
application and distribution of water as well as good 
control and monitoring of the process of irrigation with 
appropriate feedback mechanisms. Karim et al. [23]

Lipo cells, LCD, switches, relay, LED, resistors, capac-
itors, crystal Oscillator, active SIM card, filament for 
additive manufacturing, metal frame for PV and con-
trol unit.
The capability of the automated irrigation system 
include the ability to take intelligent decisions on its 
state, based on operational and soil conditions. Also, 
the solar power provision will enable it sustain a con-
tinuous operation at all times and to achieve high 
reliability in its operations. The need for irrigation 
tend to increase with increase in solar energy usually 
accompanied by soil moisture loss. Hence, the solar 
energy can be trapped for powering the autonomous 
system. 
2.1. System Architecture
The architecture of the developed system is pre-
sented in Figure 1.
Fig. 1. Architecture of the automated irrigation system
2.2. Automation and Control
Generally, irrigation exercise is usually carried 
out in the morning or evening hours for the sake of 
the health of farm crops. The pre-programmed time 
for irrigation was done and stored on the micro con-
troller. Hence, the microcontroller routinely checks 
for this time with respect to the environmental con-
ditions. A DS1307 timing system also known as the 
real time clock was incorporated to give an accurate 
track of the date and time of the irrigation activities 
(Figure 2).
Fig. 2. DS1307 timing system
According to the programming of the microcon-
troller, there will be need for irrigation only if the 
soil moisture goes below 25% and such irrigation 
operation is halted if the farm is irrigated up to 50%. 
Therefore, the microcontroller keeps its check for the 
environmental conditions in respect of the pre-set 
time most especially when the humidity drops below 
developed a sensor-based M2M agriculture monitor-
ing systems for developing countries citing high level 
of automation and control as one of the challenges to 
be addressed. Also, Alagupandi et al. [24] developed 
a smart irrigation system for outdoor environment us-
ing TinyOS while Gutierrez [25] developed an automat-
ed irrigation system using a wireless sensor network 
and GPRS module. These works provided a convenient 
platform for automation, control and tracking of irri-
gation activities. Mrinmayi et al. [26] also developed 
a smart irrigation system using internet of things while 
Roy and Ansari [27], developed autonomous irrigation 
systems that uses every day climate criterion for irriga-
tion purpose. This helps in saving considerable amount 
of water for irrigation via the use of Programmable 
Logic Controller (PLC). The issue of water loss due to 
precipitation has been identified as one of the major 
challenges during the irrigation process. In a bid to 
address this challenge, Kumar et al. [28] developed an 
automatic irrigation system that uses field sensing and 
forecasting in an attempt to control irrigation based on 
soil moisture for the sustainable irrigation of crops. For 
effective distribution and control of water irrigation ac-
tivities, Bai and Liang [29] as well as Li-Fang [30] de-
veloped an optimal model for water conservation. The 
parameters that are essential in order to facilitate good 
monitoring and control are; temperature, air humidity 
and soil moisture [30–35]. The design objectives of the 
developed automated irrigation system are to achieve 
operational intelligence, automation and independ-
ence thereby easing the stress often associated with 
conventional irrigation practices. The novelties of this 
work lies in the fact that the ease of operation of the 
developed automated system comes with its multiple 
modes of operation, which affords the user convenient 
choices of operation. The modes include the full auto-
mation mode whereby the system operates autono-
mously using the states of the timing system and the 
soil feedback sensor to take intelligent decisions on 
appropriate time and extent of irrigation activities to 
be implemented. In addition, a user could send a com-
mand remotely via mobile phone to the field system to 
start or stop irrigation. Furthermore, users have the 
privilege of querying the system remotely in order to 
get feedback on the real time soil conditions. Upon re-
ceiving such command via the Short Message Service 
(SMS), the system queries the soil feedback sensor and 
sends the soil moisture readings to the authorized us-
er(s). The system can also be made to operate in the 
manual mode relying on human effort or semi auton-
omously relying on human control during certain pe-
riods such as the start up or shut down based on the 
environment and nature of irrigation activities to be 
carried out. The aforementioned peculiarities of the 
developed automated irrigation system have not been 
sufficiently reported by the existing literature.
2. Materials and Method
The materials employed in the implementation of 
this system are real time clock module, YL – 69 sen-
sor, SIM800L, Atmega328 microcontroller, DC water 
pump, PV module, LM6009 module, LM 2596 module,

25%. Anytime these two conditions are active, a relay 
is activated to switch the irrigation pump ON. A Short 
Message Service (SMS) alert is sent to the authorized 
user on the state of the pump and the active mode 
of control. The authorized user receives a message 
“Pump ON”, and Control mode: “Auto”. At any condi-
tion outside the aforementioned operational limits, 
the pump state is kept “OFF”, and the state indicates 
“Idle”. These are designed to take place without the us-
ers’ input. In addition, users can send a message “ON” 
from a mobile phone to the SIM number in the system. 
Upon receiving this message, the system activates the 
relay which will in turn activate the irrigation pump. 
The state changes to “Pump ON” and the control mode 
changes to “Remote”. The state is sent as feedback to 
the remote operator’s mobile phone. Upon receiving 
the message “OFF” from the user, the pump goes off 
and the state returns to “Idle”. This would equally be 
sent as feedback to the users’ mobile phone. The user 
also has the privilege to query the system via a sim-
ple SMS command to get the real time soil moisture 
reading, which will be sent as a message from the 
system to the users’ mobile phone. In the event of an 
emergency need of water on site, such as in the case of 
washing harvested farm crops, a manual mini switch 
is provided for the pump on – site. The Light Emit-
ting Diode (LED) goes “OFF” in the idle state, “BLUE” 
in the remote control state, “GREEN” in the timing 
or soil automation state and “RED” in manual oper-
ation mode. One of the peculiarities of this system is 
that users have the privilege of querying the system 
remotely in order to get feedback on the real time 
soil conditions. Upon receiving such command via 
the SMS, the system queries the soil feedback sensor 
and sends the soil moisture readings to authorized 
user(s). For the purpose of this work, only one mois-
ture sensor was used and this is shown in Figure 3. 
The features of the soil moisture sensor include: 
power supply (3.3 V–3.5 V), output voltage (0–4.2 V), 
current 3.5 mA), size (60 × 20 × 5 mm). It comprises 
of two probes which passes current into the soil and 
thereafter reads the electrical resistance so as to de-
termine the moisture level. High moisture content in 
the soil often triggers high conductivity of electricity 
by the soil and vice versa. The output voltage from the 
soil moisture sensor is then amplified and sent to the 
micro controller where it is converted to digital us-
ing Analogue to Digital Converter (ADC). On the con-
troller, the voltage is compared to the threshold value 
pre-set on it, if the measured voltage is less than the 
threshold value, the micro controller activates the re-
lay which turns ON the pump for irrigation activities. 
On the other hand, if the measured value exceeds or 
equal to the threshold, it implies there is no need for 
irrigation hence system remains in the idle state with 
the LED indicating “OFF”.
2.3. Power Provisioning
For a continuous and reliable operation of this 
system, an independent power supply is essential. 
As such, a PV module, which was scaled relative to 
the power requirement of the DC operated irrigation 
pump, was deployed. The control unit is equipped 
with a 10,500 mAH lithium ion battery backup to 
keep the system active at night. The power supply 
unit of the system is designed to take power also from 
the PV installation and provision power according to 
power requirement of the control sub – systems as 
shown in Figure 4.

irrigation system
2.4 Packaging and Product Outlook
The product outlook was first designed in the 
Computer Aided Design (CAD) environment (Fig-
ure 5) and produced with the aid of additive manufac-
turing technique (Figure 6).
Fig. 5. CAD of the system
For simplified installation or ease of decommis-
sioning, interfaces were created at the side of the sys-
tem unit where the PV module, the DC water pump 
and the soil moisture feedback sensor were wired 
onto the system.

Where; Q is the volumetric flow rate calculated as

Since Re > 4000, the flow of water for the irriga-
tion purpose is turbulent. The advantage of turbulent 
water flow for irrigation is that water is dispatched 
quickly through the conveying pipe at high velocities 
and flow rates thereby driving the irrigation process 
to quick completion.
Neglecting the minor losses due to pipe orienta-
tion, the frictional factor for losses in a flexible rub-
ber pipe with smooth bore is expressed by Equation 5

Water density (ρ) is 1000 kg/m3 and volume V is 
0.750 m3, hence, from Equation 7, the mass of fluid is 
calculated as 570 kg.
According to Rajput (2008), the power required to 
pump fluid is given by Equation 8.
 
P

where: ρ is the water density (1000 kg/m3), g is the 
acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s2), Q volumetric 
flow rate (2.08 × 10–4 m3/sec) and H is the pumping 
head, (12.09 m):
 
P = 1000 × 9.81 × 2.08 × 10–4 × 10.99 
 
P = 22.5 W 
The power required to pump the fluid is calculat-
ed from Equation 8 as 22.5 W and a 50 W (0.067 hp) 
pump is selected using a safety factor of 2.2 The sys-
tem is energy efficient in that it needs only 50 W of 
power to pump fluid. The pump will increase the tem-
perature of the fluid stream as given in Equations 9 
and 10.

For a pump whose required power is 25 W, run-

At equilibrium, the temperature of water equals

pump will increase the temperature by 0.0287°C, 
hence the final temperature of water for irrigation is 
25.0287°C. This falls within the safe limit of the water 
temperature for irrigation.

2.6 Performance Evaluation of the Developed 
Automated Irrigation System
For large farms, pump sizing can be easily done 
by estimating the water volume requirements of the 
farm. This would also entail appropriate sizing of 
the solar power system to deliver required power to 
the irrigation pump. Also, the ampere rating of the 
switching relay in the control system will be matched 
adequately with the current demand of the pump. 
The operational indices show that it takes the system 
about 25 secs to boot up when powered ON and about 
5 secs to receive a message instruction for pump acti-
vation. The solar power system delivers about 300 W, 
with the feedback response time from the soil mois-
ture sensor about 0.5 secs and the volume of water 
pumped approximately 750 L/hr which is adequate 
for small experimental farm. The smart irrigation 
monitoring is embedded with soil moisture sensor to 
sense and obtain the values of moisture for any loca-
tion to be irrigated. This is a critical factor which pro-
vides information about the condition of the soil to 
be irrigated so as to determine the need for irrigation 
or otherwise as well the quantity of water needed for 
irrigation. The system also provides irrigation data 
in terms of the volume of water used for irrigation, 
period of irrigation as well as the total time spent on 
irrigation, hence the development of the smart irriga-
tion system provides design data for prediction and 
forecasting as well secondary data scaling its devel-
opment or subsequent redesign.
2.7 Numerical Experiment
In order to develop a predictive model for the de-
termination of volume of required for irrigation and 
study the effect of three critical factors that influences 
the water requirement of the soil namely; soil mois-
ture, ambient air temperature and humidity, the dy-
namic modelling and simulation was carried out using 
the Response Surface Methodology (RSM). While the 
ambient air temperature accounts for the overall tem-
perature of the outdoor air where the irrigation activity 
is to be performed, humidity represents the amount of 
water vapour present in the air. A multifunctional tem-
perature and humidity measurement device (PCE-THA 
10-ICA) whose temperature measurement ranges from 
–15 to 50° and humidity measurement ranges between 
5–95% was employed for measuring both the temper-
ature and the humidity of the environment where irri-
gation activity is to be performed. The range of values 
of three critical parameters namely; moisture content 
(20–40%), ambient temperature (15–35°C) and hu-
midity (10–30%) were used as input parameters into 
the Central Compose Design (CCD) and Response Sur-
face Methodology (RSM) to develop a predictive model 
that correlates the volume of water required for irriga-
tion purpose as a function of the three critical param-
eters. The essence of optimization is to provide an op-
timum solution for irrigation purpose. The optimum 
solution include the determination of the need for irri-
gation and the right volume of water required. This will 
save water, time and cost thereby promoting effective 
irrigation process. 
3. Results and Discussion
The irrigation of small farm land of cross section 
100 m × 100 m was carried for three different soil 
samples namely; sandy, loamy and clay soil at five 
different locations between 8:00–8:59 am. The data 
collected from the soil moisture sensor, the multifunc-
tional temperature and humidity measurement de-
vice and the micro controller are presented in Table 1.
Figure 7 is a plot of volume of water used and the 
time spent for the irrigation for the three soil samples. 
Three critical factors namely; soil moisture, ambient 
temperature and humidity determined the volume of 
water required for irrigation. The water requirement 
was highest in sandy soil and least in clay soil. This 
is due to the fact that the moisture content is highest 
in clay and least in sandy soil. The clay soil has high 
water retention ability due to its structure hence the 
reason for the high value of its moisture content, fol-
lowed by loamy soil and then sandy soil. The require-
ment of water by the soil was observed to increase as 
the value of soil moisture decreases. 
The equation of the predictive model is expressed 
by Equation 11:

Fig. 7. Volume of water required and time for irrigation
The developed model was validated using the 
Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). It was found to be high-
ly adequate for the prediction of the volume of water 
needed for irrigation as the regression model was 
found to be highly significant at 95% confidence lev-
el. The correlation coefficients namely; the R-squared 
(0.9695), adjusted R-squared (0.9533) and predicted 
R-squared (0.9785) were within the same range and 
very close to 1 for input parameters. The closer the 
correlation coefficients to 1, the more efficient and re-
liable the predictive ability of developed model.
Figure 8 is a 3 D plot that studies the effect of the 
interaction of humidity and temperature on the need 
for irrigation as well as the volume of water required. 
Humidity is the amount of water vapour present in 
the air. It is high when the amount of water vapour in 
the air is high while the ambient temperature is the 
degree of hotness or coldness of the air in the envi-
ronment.
Humidity increases as the amount of water vapour 
in the air is increases. From Figure 8, the relationship 
between the humidity and temperature is inversely 
proportional. Keeping the percent moisture content 
constant at 23.02%, the percent humidity increas-
es as ambient temperature decreases. This is due to 
the fact that air tend to hold more water molecules as 
ambient temperature increases hence the relative hu-
midity decreases. The optimum volume of the water 
required for irrigation is 1025 litres.
Figure 9 is a 3 D plot that studies the effect of the 
interaction of soil humidity and temperature on the 
need for irrigation as well as the volume of water re-
quired. As temperature increases, percent moisture 
content decreases. This is due to the fact that the rate 
of evaporation increases with increase in tempera-
ture with attendant decrease in the moisture content. 
The optimum value of the volume required for irriga-
tion is 1060.9 litres.

4. Conclusion
The development of the automated irrigated was 
successful carried out in a CAD environment and 
produced with the aid of additive manufacturing 
technique. It offers the benefits of improved farming 
practices via automation which enhances agricultural 
productivity and encourages round – the – year farm-
ing, efficient water distribution and management, 
while reducing the drudgery of manual labour, real 
time monitoring and control as well as proper sched-
uling of irrigation activities and enhances multiple 
mode of operation with query and feedback mecha-
nism. The work is an improvement over existing work 
in that the ease of operation comes with its multiple 
modes of operation which affords user convenient 
choices of operation. Also, a predictive model that 
correlates the volume of required as a function of 
the soil moisture, air temperature and humidity was 
developed. This will assist in predicting the time nec-
essary for irrigation as well as the volume of water 
required for the irrigation process. 
PUBLIC INTEREST STATEMENT
This work is in line with the quest to improve 
food security via the deployment of appropriate tech-
nology for farm irrigation in order to improve crop 
yields and ease human drudgery. With the increasing 
awareness and advocacy for round-the-year farming, 
and the need to meet up with the global challenge of 
food demand, deploying appropriate technologies to 
increase productivity and to reduce the burden often 
associated with farm practices has become inevitable 
hence this work provides a standalone automated ir-
rigation system which features good automation and 
control achieved using an array of electronic timing 
system, soil feedback sensor and wireless communi-
cation system.

  Explanation: **Closed-Loop Control and Feedback Mechanisms**

In autonomous irrigation systems, closed-loop control and feedback mechanisms play a critical role in ensuring efﬁcient and effective water management. These mechanisms continuously monitor various parameters related to the irrigation process, such as soil moisture, crop water needs, and weather conditions, and then use this information to adjust the irrigation schedule and water amount accordingly.

**Concept and Implementation**

The concept of closed-loop control in autonomous irrigation systems involves collecting real-time data from sensors, processing the data to make informed decisions, and adjusting the irrigation system based on those decisions. This continuous feedback loop helps the system adapt to changing conditions and optimize water usage.

**Types of Feedback Mechanisms**

**Soil Moisture Sensors:** These sensors measure the moisture level in the soil and provide real-time data on the water content available to plants. This information is crucial for determining when and how much to irrigate.

**Weather Stations:** Weather stations collect data on temperature, humidity, rainfall, and wind speed. This information helps the system adjust irrigation schedules based on weather forecasts and reduce water usage during periods of high rainfall or humidity.

**Crop Water Sensors:** These sensors measure the water status of plants by monitoring their physiological responses. They can provide data on plant water potential, stomatal conductance, and transpiration rates. This information helps the system optimize irrigation based on the speciﬁc needs of the crops.

**Algorithms and Automation:** The collected data is processed using algorithms that determine the appropriate irrigation schedule. These algorithms consider factors such as soil moisture levels, crop water needs, weather forecasts, and historical data to make informed decisions about irrigation timing, duration, and amount.

**Benefits of Closed-Loop Control**

* **Increased Water Efﬁciency:** Closed-loop control systems ensure that crops receive the precise amount of water they need, minimizing water wastage and optimizing yields.
* **Reduced Labor Costs:** Automated irrigation systems eliminate the need for manual monitoring and adjustment, saving time and labor costs.
* **Improved Crop Health:** Optimal irrigation practices promote healthy crop growth, reducing the risk of water stress and disease.
* **Environmental Sustainability:** Efﬁcient water usage conserves this precious resource and reduces environmental impact.
* **Data-Driven Decision-Making:** The continuous feedback loop provides valuable data that can be analyzed to improve irrigation strategies and make informed decisions about crop management practices.

**Challenges and Future Directions**

While closed-loop control offers signiﬁcant beneﬁts, there are still challenges to address, such as sensor accuracy, data reliability, and the need for robust algorithms. Future research and development will focus on enhancing these aspects to further improve the precision and effectiveness of autonomous irrigation systems.

IoT European Large-Scale Pilots – Integration, Experimentation and Testing
Abstract
The IoT European Large-Scale Pilots Programme includes the innovation
consortia that are collaborating to foster the deployment of IoT solutions
in Europe through the integration of advanced IoT technologies across the
value chain, demonstration of multiple IoT applications at scale and in a usage
context, and as close as possible to operational conditions.
The programme projects are targeted, goal-driven initiatives that propose
IoT approaches to speciﬁc real-life industrial/societal challenges. They are
autonomous entities that involve stakeholders from the supply side to the
demand side, and contain all the technological and innovation elements,
the tasks related to the use, application and deployment as well as the
development, testing and integration activities.
This chapter describes the IoT Large Scale Pilot Programme initiative
together with all involved actors. These actors include the coordination and
support actions CREATE-IoT and U4IoT, being them drivers of the pro-
gramme, and all ﬁve IoT Large-Scale Pilot projects, namely ACTIVAGE,
IoF2020, MONICA, SynchroniCity and AUTOPILOT.
8.1 IoT European Large-Scale Pilots Programme
The scope of the IoT European Large-Scale Pilots Programme is to foster the
deployment of IoT solutions in Europe through the integration of advanced
IoT technologies across the value chain, demonstration of multiple IoT appli-
cations at scale and in a usage context, and as close as possible to operational
conditions. Speciﬁc pilot considerations include:
• Mapping of pilot architecture approaches with validated IoT reference
architectures such as IoT-A enabling interoperability across use cases.
• Contribution to strategic activity groups that were deﬁned during the
LSP kick-off meeting to foster coherent implementation of the different
IoT Large-Scale Pilots.
• Contribution to clustering their results of horizontal nature (interoper-
ability approach, standards, security and privacy approaches, business
validation and sustainability, methodologies, metrics, etc.).
The IoT European Large-Scale Pilots Programme includes projects address-
ing the IoT applications based on European relevance, technology readiness
and socio-economic interest in Europe. The IoT Large-Scale Pilot projects
overview is illustrated in Figure 8.1, and the areas addressed by the projects
are listed below.
8.1 IoT European Large-Scale Pilots Programme
223
Figure 8.1
IoT European Large-Scale Pilots Programme Projects Overview.
Research and innovation effort in speciﬁc IoT topics ensure the longer-
term evolution of Internet of Things and the IoT European Large-Scale Pilots
Programme projects are addressing:
• The integration and further research and development, where needed,
of the most advanced technologies across the value chain (components,
devices, networks, middleware, service platforms, application functions)
and their operation at large scale to respond to real needs of end-users
(public authorities, citizens and business), based on underlying open
technologies and architectures that may be reused across multiple use
cases and enable interoperability across those.
• The validation of user acceptability by addressing, in particular, issues
of trust, attention, security and privacy through pre-deﬁned privacy and
security impact assessments, liability and coverage of user needs in the
speciﬁc real-life scenarios of the pilot.
• The validation of the related business models to guarantee the sustain-
ability of the approach beyond the project.
The IoT Large-Scale Pilots make use of the rich portfolio of technologies
and tools so far developed and demonstrated in reduced and controlled
environments and extend them to real-life use case scenarios with the goal of
validating advanced IoT solutions across complete value chains with actual
users and proving its socio-economic potential.
Support actions provide consistency and linkages between the pilots and
complement them by addressing horizontal challenges critically important
for the take-up of IoT at the anticipated scale. These include ethics and
privacy, trust and security, respect for the scarcity and vulnerability of human
224

attention, validation and certiﬁcation, standards and interoperability, user
acceptability and control, liability and sustainability.
The projects together form the IoT European Large-Scale Pilots Pro-
gramme and a coordination body ensures an efﬁcient interplay of the various
elements of the IoT Focus Area and liaises with relevant initiatives at EU,
Member States and international levels. The coordination is implemented by
the creation of Activity Groups that are addressing topics of common interest
across the Large-Scale Pilots.
8.2 ACTIVAGE – Activating Innovative IoT Smart Living
Environments for Ageing Well
ACTIVAGE is a European Multi Centric Large-Scale Pilot on Smart Liv-
ing Environments. The main objective is to build the ﬁrst European IoT
ecosystem across 9 Deployment Sites (DS) in seven European countries (see
Figure 8.2), reusing and scaling up underlying open and proprietary IoT plat-
forms, technologies and standards, and integrating new interfaces needed to
provide interoperability across these heterogeneous platforms. This ecosys-
tem will enable the deployment and operation at large scale of Active and
Healthy Ageing IoT based solutions and services, supporting and extending
the independent living of older adults in their environments, and responding
to real needs of caregivers, service providers and public authorities.
8.2.1 Introduction
Throughout Europe and all around the world, mortality rates have fallen
signiﬁcantly over the past decades [1] leading to considerable changes in the
age distribution of societies [2, 3]. In this context, people aged 60 are now
expected to survive an additional 18.5 to 21.6 years and soon the world will
have a higher number of older adults than children. This transformation is
expected to continue, with the age group of elders (65+) growing from 18%
to 28% of the EU population by the year 2060. Furthermore, according to
the 2015 Ageing Report [4], one in three Europeans will be over 65 with a
ratio of “working” to “inactive” population of 2 to 1, this representing a heavy
impact on health and social care systems. Indeed, population ageing creates
a common challenge for European countries as they must ﬁnd ways to do
more with less. Citizen empowerment and incitation to self-equip is one of
the explored options.
8.2 ACTIVAGE – Activating Innovative IoT Smart Living Environments
225
Figure 8.2
ACTIVAGE Deployment Sites in 7 EU countries.
All of the aforementioned ﬁndings, highlighted the Active ageing and
independent living activities (such as the EIP Action Group C2 – action plan)
as the ﬁnal goals for EU initiatives related to older adults [5].
Thus, legislation, technology, and reimbursement charges, enforce the
health and social care systems to improve the way they are providing ser-
vices to the European citizens. The “Active and Healthy Ageing” (AHA)
community is wide and heterogeneous in terms of needs, demands and
living environments [6]. AHA services based on the Internet-of-Things are
promising to be a strategic component to support the creation of ecosystem
able to dynamically answer and prevent the challenges faced by the health
and social care systems [7] (H&SCS): the “always-connected” paradigm is
becoming a way of life, and this could result in a positive transformation for
H&SCS who are looking for new ways to reorient the provision of care and
keep older people active and independent for longer.

8.2.2 Project Description
8.2.2.1 Main concepts in ACTIVAGE
ACTIVAGE is designed as ONE multi-centric Large-Scale Pilot across
Europe. ACTIVAGE brings UNITY of objectives, evaluation methodologies,
co-operation to achieve critical mass, and a single European platform to
create and share evidence. Deployment Sites (DS) join clusters of stake-
holders in the Active and Healthy Living value network, working together
within a geographical space (a city or a region). These clusters or AHA-
Business Ecosystems are mainly composed by a cohort of users (older
adults, formal and informal caregivers), service providers; health care/social
care administration; technological infrastructures and technology providers
(infrastructure, sensors, applications, etc.).
DSs will deploy Reference Use Cases (UC) (see Figure 8.3) that address
speciﬁc end-user needs, to improve their quality of life and autonomy. A
single common interoperable ACTIVAGE IoT Ecosystem Suite (AIOTES)
will be built up that provides every DS with the capacity to develop stan-
dard and interoperable IoT ecosystems on top of legacy IoT platforms, or
communication and data management infrastructures. GLOCAL Evaluation
Framework (Local KPIs and global KPIs) will be designed and implemented
to demonstrate and evaluate health & social outcomes and socio-economic

impact from local up to a European scale, enabling effective exchange of
experiences and cooperation among peers (e.g. users, providers, policy mak-
ers). 9 DS rolled out in 7 countries to constitute a major breakthrough to
sustain open innovation in AHA ﬁeld.
8.2.2.2 Targeted users and user needs
Within ACTIVAGE, “Ageing Well with IoT” is considered as the goal
to extend healthy living years of older adults living independently and
autonomously in their preferred environments by the massive adoption of IoT
solutions. One of the most accepted measurement scales in different studies
in Europe and World Wide is the Clinical Frailty Scale [8]: ACTIVAGE will
concentrate on IoT solutions for older people classiﬁed under categories 1
to 5: “Very ﬁt”, “Well, Managing well”, “Vulnerable” and “Mildly frail”.
ACTIVAGE will focus on deploying IoT solutions that work towards keeping
older people away from category 6 and beyond, which already represents
a signiﬁcant cost in care for informal carers and for the formal healthcare
systems.
ACTIVAGE focusses on “domains of needs” for the support of the older
population and in order to create a demand-driven experience on the basis of
Figure 8.4
Mapping of needs and use cases.

IoT European Large-Scale Pilots – Integration, Experimentation and Testing
the reference Ageing Well initiatives around the world. Figure 8.4 shows the
domains of needs (on circles) and the Use Cases (UC) that will be deployed
in the 9 DS involving up to 7,000 users.
8.2.3 The ACTIVAGE Model of IoT Ecosystem for Active
and Healthy Ageing
ACTIVAGE is committed to build the ﬁrst European AHA-IoT Ecosystem
which is modelled as a technological infrastructure of hardware-software-
services and standard protocols i.e. the “ACTIVAGE AIOTES”, and a con-
stellation of stakeholders interacting with each other within a governance
framework towards the achievement of common goals.
Figure 8.5 shows this conceptual scheme. Data is the core asset of the
ecosystem. Private Data is produced by wearable and medical devices and
smart sensors and devices in their living environments (e.g. home, car, public
spaces, etc.). Public data might come from different sources, not necessary
linked to user interactions (e.g. weather, public services time tables, etc.).
Personal/private data might be processed at the edge and at cloud level. If
appropiate, interoperability interfaces are provided, enabling the delivery of
a huge amount of data to be channeled across the pipeline and eventually
feed hundreds or thousands of services for senior people, providers and
payors.
The realization of this model is accomplished in ACIVAGE by the
AIOTES: this is comprised of two layers that form all the necessary
Figure 8.5
Model of AHA-IoT ecosystem.
8.2 ACTIVAGE – Activating Innovative IoT Smart Living Environments
229
components for: a) the support of a universal interoperability framework for
the integration of the widest possible spectrum of platforms in the area of
Active and Health Living and b) the formation of the diverse application
marketplace and a set of application tools for the support of creators in
the development and deployment phases of new applications. Figure 8.6
summarizes the envisioned architecture. The ﬁnal architecture will be in
compliance with standardisation projects such as IoT-A. The ACTIVAGE
system will be separated into two distinct layers.
The IoT Interoperability Layer is aiming to efﬁciently and effectively
integrate a wide spectrum of open and commercial platforms and IoT devices,
having as a starting point the platforms provided for the ACTIVAGE and the
IoT devices used in the Deployment Sites as shown in Figure 8.6. This layer
will be further separated into two frameworks that will create standardized
interfaces for a) the sharing of data with sensors and devices and b) the
interoperability of their offered services. The Services Layer will include
a number of functionalities to support efﬁcient integration and effective
deployment of new services to the envisioned ecosystem: the Applications
Support Tools and the Marketplace.
8.2.4 Expected Project Impacts
The ACTIVAGE project has established a set of strategic impacts aligned
with the vision of the project and designed to drive the activities across the
project:
• Societal impact: ACTIVAGE may create evidence that support how
AHA services based on IoT improve the quality of life of older adults,
supporting the long-term sustainability and efﬁciency of health and
social care systems. Aligned with this impact, ACTIVAGE may give
answer to users’ empowerment with the control of their data, safety
and wellness, promoting healthy and active ageing, while enhancing
the competitiveness of EU industry through new business models and
expansion in new markets.
• Innovation impact: ACTIVAGE may ignite the economic growth by
inﬂuencing the strategic decisions of the different stakeholders, offering
a value based proposal built by the co-creation of the different stake-
holders’ views and interest. Only a valuable proposal with an integral
multi-stakeholders commitment will assure the following key aspects:
a) public and private investment by health and social care makers,

8.3 IoF2020 – Internet of Food and Farm 2020
231
b) service providers adoption of cost-effective business models, c) senior
citizens involvement in the creation and adoption of AHA services,
d) to foster industrial innovation on IoT, wearables and sensor tech-
nologies and support standards for interoperability, and e) creation of
new reliable and useful AHA solutions and services by SMEs and
entrepreneurs.
• Economic impact: ACTIVAGE project may analyse the potential sav-
ing and contributions to the sustainability of the health care and social
systems, and the readiness and maturity of the IoT technologies and
ecosystem to host local solutions and to import and replicate solutions
from other providers/location focused on value-based criteria.
8.2.5 Summary
During its 42 months duration the project will be aligned along a single
ﬁve phase innovation path. After evaluating and demonstrating evidence
and value to stakeholders in local Use Cases (UC), DSs will cooperate bi-
laterally or tri-laterally, allowing coherent, complementary replication of UC,
to generate evidence on the value of interoperability and standardisation at a
European scale. In the last phase, DSs will open to European external actors
to incubate new UCs, technologies, solutions and Business Cases. Open calls
will attract entrepreneurs and start-ups to implement innovative solutions
using the mature DS’s IoT ecosystem for testing, demonstration and initial
market take-up.
8.3 IoF2020 – Internet of Food and Farm 2020
The Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to be a real game changer that will
drastically improve productivity and sustainability in food and farming. How-
ever, current IoT applications in this domain are still fragmentary and mainly
used by a small group of early adopters. The Internet of Food and Farm 2020
Large-Scale Pilot (IoF2020) addresses the organizational and technological
challenges to overcome this situation by fostering a large-scale uptake of
IoT in the European food and farming domain. The heart of the project is
formed by a balanced set of multi-actor trials that reﬂect the diversity of
the food and farming domain. Each trial is composed of well-delineated
use cases developing IoT solutions for the most relevant challenges of the
concerned subsector. The project conducts 5 trials with a total of 19 use cases
in arable, dairy, fruits, vegetables and meat production. IoF2020 embraces a
232
IoT European Large-Scale Pilots – Integration, Experimentation and Testing
lean multi-actor approach that combines the development of Minimal Viable
Products (MVPs) in short iterations with the active involvement of various
stakeholders. The architectural approach supports interoperability of multiple
use case systems and reuse of IoT components across them. Use cases are
also supported in developing business and solving governance issues. The
IoF2020 ecosystem and collaboration space is established to boost the uptake
of IoT in Food and Farming and pave the way for new innovations.
8.3.1 Introduction
IoT is a powerful driver that is expected to transform the entire farming and
food domain into smart webs of connected objects that are context-sensitive
and can be identiﬁed, sensed and controlled remotely [9–11]. IoT will be a
real game changer in agriculture that drastically improves productivity and
sustainability. This vision is illustrated by the story in Figure 8.7, which is an
March 2020, a field somewhere in Europe 
The morning mist soaks into thick shreds across the country, above the sun rises and turns the horizon red. From 
the fog a soft humming sound, two tractors emerge. When he spots me, the driver of the second tractor steps out, 
but where is the driver of the first tractor? There is none, says the farmer, I operate both machines. How? Well, that 
strange vehicle you saw here last week has mapped the whole field and this map is now instructing the board 
computers of the two tractors how to drive. The first tractor exactly follows pre-programmed lines and carries out 
soil cultivation, based on soil composition. My tractor with a sowing machine automatically follows the same lines 
and automatically adjusts distance, quantity and variety of potato seed. Incredible, isn’t it? 
Two weeks later… 
The same field. An unmanned small tractor drives with a high speed along the same invisible straight lines. With 
surgical precision, a hoe eliminates every weed in the field, the farmer says. This saves a lot of chemicals and 
labour in comparison to earlier days where we had to spray the full field with a heavy tractor. So this is good for 
the environment and I have much less costs! Within a few weeks the fertilizer will follow the same lines again and 
by a pre-defined task map it knows exactly where and what to put different types of fertilizer for optimal growth of 
the plants. That map was generated on the basis of big data analysis and calculations in the cloud involving 
relevant data from the market, weather and public regulations. Additional cameras are checking the crop and, if 
necessary, make corrections. Again, the plants just get enough nutrients to grow optimally and nothing is spoiled to 
the environment. Wow, amazing! Come, I’ll show you how it works in the office. Don’t you have to stay with your 
tractor? Oh no, it knows what it is doing. 
At the office with a good old-fashioned cup of coffee… 
Of course we farmers are still in charge of our own farm but most of the field operations are carried out 
automatically by autonomous objects. Now we can focus on the market choices and take care of communication 
with our customers and last but not least citizens who are very much involved in farming nowadays. After 
execution of the field work, the measured data is automatically returned from the machine to the office through the 
cloud. This is the basis for subsequent tasks. But I also provide it to research institutes, which feed these data into 
computer models for further improvement. The same holds for public legislation and certification bodies. They use 
the same data to check for compliance to their rules. Every organisation has access to a specific set of our data in 
the cloud. Of course, this is subject to strict security and privacy rules. No, no, I don’t want leave my data lying 
around. Oh yes, by the way, food safety and traceability is not an issue anymore; it is highly guaranteed by all kind 
of sensors and in case something might go wrong early warning systems alert me in time.

example for arable farming, but it is exemplary for other subsectors such as
dairy, meat, vegetables, and fruits including wine and olives.
To make this vision come true much technology is already available,
although there are speciﬁc IoT challenges in this sector. Agri-Food ‘things’
are often living objects and attached devices have to work in harsh envi-
ronments, while network connectivity in rural areas can be challenging. In
fact, a large-scale uptake of IoT in agriculture is in particular prevented by
a lack of interoperability, user concerns about data ownership, privacy and
security, and by appropriate business models that are also suitable for (very)
small companies [12, 13]. Consequently, current IoT applications in farming
and food are still fragmentary and mainly used by a small group of early
adopters, despite the great world-wide interest of IoT technology providers
and investors.
IoF2020 is a European Large-Scale Pilot (LSP) on IoT for Smart Farming
and Food Security. Its main objective is to foster a large-scale uptake of IoT
in the European farming and food domain. This will contribute to a next huge
innovation boost and consequently to a drastically improved productivity and
sustainability in the agri-food domain. More speciﬁcally, IoF2020 aims to:
• Demonstrate the business case of IoT for a large number of application
areas in farming and food;
• Integrate and reuse available IoT technologies by exploiting open
architectures and standards;
• Ensure user acceptability of IoT solutions in farming and food by
addressing user needs, including security, privacy and trust;
• Ensure the sustainability of IoT solutions beyond the project by vali-
dating the related business models and setting up an IoT Ecosystem for
large scale uptake.
The IoF2020 consortium consists of 71 public and private partners from 16
different countries and has a total budget of 35 Me. The project started in
January 2017 and will last for 4 years.
8.3.2 Trials and Use cases
The heart of the project is formed by a balanced set of multi-actor trials
that reﬂect the diversity of the food and farming domain, including different
agricultural sub sectors, conventional and organic farming, early adopters and
early majority farmers, SMEs and large industrial companies, and different
234
IoT European Large-Scale Pilots – Integration, Experimentation and Testing
supply chain roles including logistics and consumption. Each trial is com-
posed of well-delineated use cases that together address the most relevant
challenges for the concerned subsector. The use cases follow a demand-driven
philosophy in which IoT solutions for speciﬁc business needs are developed
by a dedicated team of agri-food end users and IoT companies (integra-
tors, app/service developers, infrastructure/technology providers) with a clear
commercial drive, supported by R&D organisations. IoF2020 conducts 5
trials with a total of 19 use cases in arable, dairy, fruits, vegetables and meat
production (Figure 8.8).
The Internet of Arable Farming (trial 1) integrates operations
across the entire arable cropping cycle combining IoT technolo-
gies, data acquisition (soil, crop, climate) in growing and storage
of arable crops (potatoes, wheat and soya beans). These will be
linked to existing sensor networks, earth observation systems, crop
growth models and yield gap analysis tools and external databases (e.g. eco-
nomic/environmental impact) and translated into farm management systems.
The trial will result in increasing yields, less environmental impact, easier
cross-compliance and product traceability and more use of technology by
farmers. The trial consists of 4 use cases:
1.1 Within-ﬁeld management zoning: deﬁning speciﬁc ﬁeld management
zones by developing and linking sensing- and actuating devices with
external data;
Figure 8.8
Geographical coverage of the IoF2020 trials and use cases.
8.3 IoF2020 – Internet of Food and Farm 2020
235
1.2 Precision Crop Management: smart wheat crop management by sensors
data embedded in a low-power, long-range network infrastructure;
1.3 Soya Protein Management: improving protein production by combining
sensor data and translate them into effective machine task operations;
1.4 Farm Machine Interoperability: data exchange between ﬁeld machinery
and farm management information systems for supporting cross-over
pilot machine communication.
The Internet of Dairy Farming (trial 2) implements, experi-
ences and demonstrates the use of real-time sensor data (e.g. neck
collar) together with GPS location data to create value in the chain
from ‘grass to glass’, resulting in more efﬁcient use of resources
and production of quality foods, combined with a better animal
health, welfare and environment implementation. The trial focuses on feeding
and reproduction of cows through early warning systems and quality data that
can be used for remote calibration and validation of sensors and consists of 4
use cases:
2.1 Grazing Cow Monitor: monitoring and managing the outdoor graz-
ing of cows by GPS tracking within ultra-narrow band communication
networks;
2.2 Happy Cow: improving dairy farm productivity through 3D cow activity
sensing and cloud machine learning technologies;
2.3 Silent Herdsman: herd alert management by a high node count distributed
sensor network and a cloud-based platform for decision-making;
2.4 Remote Milk Quality: remote quality assurance of accurate instruments
and analysis & pro-active control in the dairy chain.
The Internet of Fruits (trial 3) demonstrates IoT technology
that is integrated throughout the whole supply chain from the
ﬁeld, logistics, processing to the retailer. Sensors in orchards and
vineyards (incl. weather stations, multispectral/thermal cameras)
will be connected through the cloud and used for monitoring,
early warning of pests and diseases and control (e.g. variable rate spraying,
selective harvesting). Traceability devices (incl. RFID, multidimensional bar-
codes) and smart packaging allows for condition monitoring during storage,
processing, transportation and on the shelves. Big data analyses will further
optimize all processes in the whole chain. This will result in reduced pre-
and post-harvest losses, less inputs, higher (fresh) quality and better traceable
products (incl. protected designation of origin, PDO). The trial consists of 4
coherent use cases:
236
IoT European Large-Scale Pilots – Integration, Experimentation and Testing
3.1 Fresh table grapes chain: real-time monitoring and control of water
supply and crop protection of table grapes and predicting shelf life;
3.2 Big wine optimization: optimizing cultivation and processing of wine by
sensor-actuator networks and big data analysis within a cloud framework;
3.3 Automated olive chain: automated ﬁeld control, product segmentation,
processing and commercialisation of olives and olive oil;
3.4 Intelligent fruit logistics: fresh fruit logistics through virtualization of
fruit products by intelligent trays within a low-power long-range network
infrastructure.
The Internet of Vegetables (trial 4) focuses on a combination of
environmental control levels: full-controlled indoor growing with
an artiﬁcial lighting system, semi-controlled greenhouse produc-
tion and non-regulated ambient conditions in open-air cultivation
of vegetables. It demonstrates the automatic execution of growth
recipes by the intelligent combination of sensors that measure crop conditions
and control processes (incl. lighting, climate, irrigation and logistics) and
analysis of big data that is collected through these sensors and advanced
visioning systems with location speciﬁcation. This will result in improved
production control and better communication throughout the supply chain
(incl. harvest prediction, consumer information). The trial consists of 4 use
cases:
4.1 City farming: value chain innovation for leafy vegetables in convenience
foods by integrated indoor climate control and logistics;
4.2 Chain-integrated greenhouse production: integrating the value chain and
quality innovation by developing a full sensor-actuator-based system in
tomato greenhouses;
4.3 Added value weeding data: boosting the value chain by harvesting
weeding data of organic vegetables obtained by advanced visioning
systems;
4.4 Enhanced quality certiﬁcation system: enhanced trust and simpliﬁca-
tion of quality certiﬁcation systems by use of sensors, RFID tags and
intelligent chain analyses.
The Internet of Meat (trial 5) demonstrates how the growth of
animals (individual and group level) can be optimized and commu-
nication throughout the whole supply chain can be improved based
on automated monitoring and control of advanced sensor-actuator
systems. The data generated by events will also be used for early
warning (e.g. on health status) and improve the transparency and traceability
8.3 IoF2020 – Internet of Food and Farm 2020
237
of meat throughout the whole supply chain. This will assure meat quality,
reduce mortality, optimize labour and improve animal health and welfare
leading to reduction of antibiotics. The trial consists of 3 use cases:
5.1 Pig farm management: optimise pig production management by interop-
erable on-farm sensors and slaughter house data;
5.2 Poultry chain management: optimize production, transport and process-
ing of poultry meat by automated ambient monitoring & control and data
analyses;
5.3 Meat Transparency and Traceability: enhancing transparency and trace-
ability of meat based on an monitored chain event data in an EPCIS-
infrastructure.
8.3.3 Technical Architectural Approach
Each use case will be an autonomous implementation of an IoT system, which
provides a dedicated solution for a speciﬁc domain challenge. However, for
a large scale uptake it is important to maximize synergies across multiple
use case systems. Therefore, a core concept of IoF2020 is that the use
case systems function as nodes in a software ecosystem [14]. As a conse-
quence, much attention is paid to ensuring the interoperability of multiple
use case systems and the reuse of IoT components across them. Figure 8.9
shows the architectural approach to achieve this during design, development,
implementation and deployment.
Figure 8.9
The IoF2020 architectural process to ensure reuse and interoperability of use
case IoT systems.
238
IoT European Large-Scale Pilots – Integration, Experimentation and Testing
The use case architectures will be based on a common technical reference
architecture to create a shared understanding and to maximize synergies
across multiple use case systems. Each use case within a trial will design
a speciﬁc instance of the reference architecture to address its speciﬁc user
requirements. The project will provide a catalogue of reusable system com-
ponents, which can be integrated in the IoT systems of multiple use cases
to facilitate large-scale uptake. This repository goes beyond a checklist and
includes practical guidelines and implementation tools. The IoF2020 lab
will support the implementation of reusable IoT components in a testbed
environment. Finally, IoF2020 will provide a Collaboration Space in which
services and data can be shared as a key enabler to facilitate the interaction
between the IoT systems of the use cases during deployment. As indicated,
the project will reuse components and knowledge from previous projects and
existing organizations and try to embed and sustain the project results into the
same organizations.
8.3.4 Lean Multi-Actor Approach
IoF2020 embraces a demand-driven methodology in which end-users from
the agri-food are actively involved during the entire development process
aiming at cross-fertilisation, co-creation and co-ownership of results (see
Figure 8.10).
The approach for the use cases is a combination of the lean start-up
methodology that focuses on the development of Minimal Viable Products
Figure 8.10
IoF2020 Project approach and structure.
8.4 MONICA – Management of Networked IoT Wearables – Very Large Scale
239
(MVPs) in short iterations and the multi-actor approach that stresses the
active involvement of various stakeholders. The use cases will actively be
supported by three other work packages (WPs). WP3 facilitates sharing,
reuse and ﬁnally integration of IoT components as described in the previous
section. WP4 provides business support in terms of monitoring KPIs, business
models, market studies and governance aspects (incl. security, data owner-
ship, privacy, liability and ethical issues). WP5 facilitates the development
and expansion of the various ecosystems on use case and project level
and beyond amongst others by communication, dissemination, organizing
workshops and events and by active involvement of European and national
communities from the demand- and supply-side of IoT, including industry
associations and cooperatives, European Innovation Partnerships, Technol-
ogy Platforms and ERAnets. A mid-term open call of 6 Me will be used
to further accelerate these developments. This approach establishes a large
IoF2020 ecosystem and collaboration space that is expected to sustain after
the project.
8.3.5 Conclusion and Outlook
IoF2020 aims to boost the uptake of IoT in European Food and Farming.
This will be realized through a balanced set of multi-actor trials and use
cases in several subsectors. The use cases are developed in a scalable manner
through an open technical architecture and infrastructure with components
that can be shared and reused by stakeholders outside the project. This devel-
opment is leveraged by activities that build-up and extend the total ecosystem,
deﬁning attractive and successful business models and solving governance
issues. In this way IoF2020 will pave the way for data-driven farming,
autonomous operations, virtual food chains and personalized nutrition for
European citizens.
8.4 MONICA – Management of Networked IoT Wearables –
Very Large Scale Demonstration of Cultural Societal
Applications
The Large-Scale Pilot MONICA demonstrates how cities can use the Internet
of Things to deal with sound, noise and security challenges at big, cultural,
open-air events. A range of applications will be demonstrated in six major
European cities involving more than 100,000 users in total. The project brings
together 29 partners from 9 European countries with the objectives to provide
240

improve responsiveness to security challenges1.
a very large-scale demonstration of multiple existing and new Internet of
Things technologies for Smarter Living.
Imagine sound zones at outdoor concerts in the city where the sound
experience is enhanced for those who enjoy the music and the noise mitigated
for those who don’t. Visualise intelligent cameras deployed at city festivals
which, while preserving privacy, estimate crowd size and density in real time,
notifying security staff of any unusual crowd behaviour. Or imagine smart
wristbands and mobile apps, allowing people to interact with each other and
the performers, informing people of the best way out of the venue or guiding
them to the nearest exit in case of an emergency.
These are some of the several applications which MONICA will demon-
strate at minimum 16 cultural events, taking place all over Europe in
Copenhagen, Bonn, Hamburg, Leeds, Lyon and Torino. The broad list of
events includes concerts, festivals, city and sport events and involve the
use of multiple, wearable, mobile and ﬁxed devices with sensors, such as

phones. The full list of pilot events is shown in Table 8.1.
8.4.1 Introduction
The deployment of Internet of Things has also a major impact on society
speciﬁcally in urban environments, where it helps to solve major societal
challenges. The rapidly growing number of Smart City platforms enables
cities to assemble all their digital applications on uniform communication
networks spanning entire cities delivering diverse applications such as health,
energy and resource efﬁciency, and trafﬁc management that help the city to
become more environmentally sustainable and citizens to have a better life.
In technology areas, standard IoT middleware, architecture and technology
enablers have mitigated the complexity of communication and integration and
paved the way for a wealth of innovative distributed applications in many vital
areas of our society. However, most of the IoT and Smart City platforms are
still insufﬁciently developed to handle really large scale deployment. Health
and smart living may potentially involve thousands of users, but they are
relatively scarcely distributed, even within a city, and the communication load
is limited.
In response, the MONICA platform will demonstrate a resilient IoT
platform that addresses major issues of large scale deployments: Scaling,
costs of sensors, and intelligence. On this background, the MONICA project
242
IoT European Large-Scale Pilots – Integration, Experimentation and Testing
is uniquely innovative since it will demonstrate an extremely large uptake
of a multitude of IoT applications (10,000+ simultaneous and more than
100,000 different users) using low-costs wearables and apps running on
existing wearable platforms such as smart watches and smart phones in
combination with wearable sensors. Moreover, the platform will demonstrate
heterogeneous interfaces for both expensive, professional infrastructure com-
ponents and affordable, wearable, and widely used consumer devices. Finally,
the demonstration will show closed feedback loops to actuating networks
and human interaction and intervention based on situational awareness and
decision support.
8.4.2 The MONICA Ecosystems
The MONICA IoT Platform will be demonstrated in the scope of three
ecosystems:
8.4.2.1 The Security Ecosystem
The MONICA Security Ecosystem will demonstrate how a multitude of
innovative applications for managing public security and safety can be seam-
lessly integrated with IoT sensors and actuators and used in large scale. The
core security and safety challenges at large events, such as those proposed
in MONICA, are the handling and mitigation of unforeseen incidents and
accidents: personal violence, panic scenes, severe illness of individuals in
the middle of a crowd, infrastructure catastrophes such as ﬁre or structural
collapses. The aim of any security platform is to ensure the monitoring,
recording, identiﬁcation, analysis of any part of the monitored environment,
and measures capable of predicting and, whenever possible, mitigate the
danger of potential or imminent events. The modelling of incidents and
accidents is therefore necessary in order to be able to deal with episodes
while or before they unfold. The Security Ecosystem will consist of a series
of large and small applications that, in combination, can be used to monitor
and manage the security situation before, during and after an event. The
main objectives of the applications are to demonstrate how the IoT platform
will seamlessly support open and closed loop solutions that address real-
life safety challenges. The traditional security tools used at an event are
normally a variety of perimeter security as e.g. fences, supported by CCTV
cameras, few entrances with guards and guards working around the area.
MONICA will implement additional security and safety measures, e.g. by
8.4 MONICA – Management of Networked IoT Wearables – Very Large Scale
243
combining information on the ﬂy for real-time operation and to support
the work of security staff. MONICA hence will not change the already
existing security concepts of events, rather it will complement extra valuable
real-time information supporting the early detection of potentially critical
situations.
8.4.2.2 The Acoustics Ecosystem
The MONICA Acoustic Ecosystem will demonstrate how a multitude of
innovative applications for managing open air music performances in the
public space can be seamlessly integrated with sensors and actuators using the
MONICA platform. It will consist of a series of large and small applications
that, in combination, can be used to monitor and manage the sound before,
during and after a performance. The main objectives of the applications are to
demonstrate how the IoT platform will seamlessly support open and closed
loop solutions that address real-life environmental challenges e.g. noise in
public spaces. E.g. at inner city open air concerts, sound ﬁelds will be
optimised with respect for both the performers and the concert audience in
terms of loudness, directionality and quality. The sound zone system and
actuation layer of the MONICA platform allows for dynamic adjustment of
the active sound ﬁeld control loudspeakers, thus, improving the sound quality
of visitors while at the same time reducing the noise for neighbours. Health
monitoring of sound level exposure can be offered to concerned concertgoers.
A cheap, wearable sound level meter in bracelets can be connected to a
Smartphone app and continuously measure the cumulative sound dose. The
user can thus seek less loud sections of the concert arena.
8.4.2.3 The Innovation Ecosystem
Communication to customers, crowds and citizens is improved by the use
of mobile apps and IoT wristbands with value-adding features, enabling
people to interact with and locate each other, informing visitors of the best
place to park, the best way out or the bars with the shortest queue, and
guiding participants to the nearest exit in case of an emergency. General
data such as on sound levels are made accessible as open data on the
hosting city’s websites for citizen engagement and innovation. Applications
for user involvement with artists at concerts or among citizens based on
different kinds of wearables will be tested. Open APIs will be provided to
foster new businesses and start-up solutions based on the MONICA IoT
Platform.
244
IoT European Large-Scale Pilots – Integration, Experimentation and Testing
8.4.3 User-Driven Pilots
The MONICA platform and its components will be demonstrated in six
different pilot cities in different ﬁve Member States across Europe and as
close as possible to real-life operational conditions under typical load and
constraints associated with organising big events. From the pilots, the project
will evaluate both qualitative and quantitative success measures towards
established KPI’s related to stakeholder satisfaction and the improved efﬁ-
ciency in handling of large scale events. In this framework, the following
speciﬁc activities will take place in the selected pilot sites:
• Integration, deployment and operation of commercially available ﬁxed
and mobile devices and development of new wearable devices in the
MONICA IoT and relevant Smart City infrastructures.
• Integration, deployment and operation of commercially available ﬁxed
and mobile actuating devices and the relevant software applications
mentioned above.
• Development and deployment of fully automated closed-loop systems
which uses sensing inputs from the IoT network layers to assist humans
in monitoring, situational awareness and decision making and provide
the resulting control regimes for the actuating IoT infrastructure.
• Validation of pre-deﬁned impact Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
related to each pilot site along with the methodology and the relevant
assessment procedures in order to obtain and disseminate qualitative and
quantitative date for replication.
• Demonstration of the generic applicability and interoperability of exper-
imental testbeds and open platforms in validation of IoT technologies
and identiﬁcation of where standards are missing and pre-normative
activities are needed.
• Development and validation of new markets and business models aiming
at involving all actors in the innovation value chain as well as assessing
the impact on Europe’s Cultural and Creative Industries.
• Active involvement of all actors in the validation and dissemination in
order to establish the best possible foundation for creating maximum
impact and replication potential from the demonstrations.
In addition to the planned demonstrations, the MONICA deployments
addresses – in a smaller scale – the solutions to more generic Smart City
challenges i.e. the deployment of a common ICT infrastructure and compo-
nents in city areas with very diverse needs and context, to deliver services
with different business and technical conﬁgurations. The speciﬁcation for the

times a year in spring, summer and winter and offers its attractions to 7–10 million visitors
during the 91 DOM days2.
MONICA pilots will be extracted from comprehensive use cases and concrete
business cases deﬁned by demand-side stakeholders and users. Demand-side
representatives in the requirements process will be drawn from the ﬁelds of
concert organisers, artistic performers, spectators, public authorities, citizens,
civic engagement groups, and other relevant groups found inside and outside
the consortium. This methodology allows for maximum stakeholder input
captured in the analysis of the use cases, the business ecosystem, the value
chain interactions and the general societal and environmental realm.
The implementation and deployment of the pilot sides will be based in
a mix of commercially available components and solutions, open architec-
tures and design approaches from previous the portfolio of technologies and
tools so far developed and demonstrated in reduced and controlled environ-
ments as well as targeted research and development of speciﬁc prototype
solutions where needed. Pilot work plans will include feedback mecha-
nisms to allow adaptation and optimisation of the technological and business
approach to the particular use case.

8.4.4 The MONICA Technical Concept
The MONICA platform features a cloud based on advanced, open IoT
technologies dynamically integrating ﬁxed and nomadic devices and truly
mobile wearables in the physical world with automated closed-loop actuat-
ing functions. The platform will also integrate humans in the loop where
appropriate, by providing situational awareness and dynamic decision support
tools. A strong toolbox for security and trust management will complement
the platform.
The platform will be able to support multiple IoT applications in a wide
usage context focusing on the two most important challenges for organisers
of large scale concerts and cultural events in large cities: Unwanted noise in
the surroundings and security of the audience.
8.4.4.1 The MONICA architecture
The MONICA platform is built on several IoT physical world network
infrastructures and a closed loop control system for each application. The
components are connected via dedicated communication network and data
repositories. The entire solution is embedded in a MONICA Private Cloud
structure as visualised in Figure 8.13.
8.4.4.2 The MONICA IoT Infrastructure
The MONICA IoT Infrastructure, depicted in Figure 8.14, must be capable of
handling three different types of IoT devices: i) wearable devices, ii) nomadic
devices and iii) ﬁxed sensors and ﬁxed Cyber Physical Systems.
Wearable devices include wristbands, glasses and mobile phones. Wrist-
bands are intended to be worn by the spectators and staff while glasses are
intended mainly for the security staff. Wristbands have connectivity based
on either Ultra-Wideband (UWB) or narrow-band radio (868/900 MHz)
technologies. Smart glasses instead will be used, based on the Android OS
and equipped with front-facing camera, inertial sensors, light sensor, GPS
and pressure sensor. The glasses have real see-through displays with a WVGA
resolution and have Wi-Fi b/g/n and BT4.0 connectivity. Nomadic devices are
mobile devices conﬁned to the event area, such as hand held sound dosimeters
and other sensors (e.g. sound meter, temperature sensor, wind sensor, camera,
etc.) mounted on controllable airships. Fixed sensors and Cyber Physical
Systems comprise devices mounted on ﬁxed structures in and around the
event area, e.g. sound pressure gauges and dosimeters, microphones, cameras,
anemometers, etc.

IoT Middleware will implement the IoT infrastructure using existing IoT
gateways and services, e.g. LinkSmart R⃝, FI-WARE, SCRAL, and oneM2M.
De-facto standards such as MQTT for publish/subscribe and SAREF (Smart
Appliance Reference Ontology, ETSI TS 103 264 standard) and the W3C
Semantic Sensor Network Ontology for semantic modelling will be applied.
8.4.5 Conclusion and Outlook
The MONICA project will carry out unique demonstrations of large scale take
up of IoT deployments at highly relevant inner city cultural open-air events.
It will pave the way for innovative business opportunities for technology and
software providers in the ﬁeld of IoT. Ultimately, the project aims to improve
the quality of life in our cities for all citizens.
8.5 SynchroniCity: Delivering a Digital Single Market for
IoT-enabled Urban Services in Europe and Beyond
Smart cities hold the potential to be a key driver and catalyst in creating a
large scale global IoT market of services and hardware. However, the emerg-
ing smart city market faces speciﬁc challenges that act as barriers to growth,
impeding rapid innovation and inhibiting widespread market adoption.
SynchroniCity is an ambitious initiative to deliver a digital single market
for Europe and beyond for IoT-enabled urban services by piloting its
foundations at scale in reference zones across eight European cities and
involving other cities globally. It addresses how to incentivize and build
trust for companies and citizens to actively participate and ﬁnd common
co-created IoT solutions for cities that meet citizen needs, and to create
an environment of evidence-based solutions that can easily be replicated in
other regions. These reference zones are based on cities at the forefront of
smart city development covering different geographies, cultures and sizes
and include Antwerp (BE), Carouge (CH), Eindhoven (NL), Helsinki (FI),
Manchester (UK), Milano (IT), Porto (PT) and Santander (ES). Globally,
SynchroniCity adds committed replicating reference zones in Mexico, Korea,
USA and Brazil.
8.5.1 Introduction
Digital technologies offer an opportunity to profoundly change how our
existing society works. They can enable a transformation of different industry
8.5 SynchroniCity: Delivering a Digital Single Market

sectors improving existing business activities, processes, and competencies
within organizations and across their boundaries.
Data infrastructures and the Internet of Things (IoT) form a critical part
of the digital transformation of cities and communities by creating adequate
awareness of real-world processes in order to drive more efﬁcient, partially
autonomous, decision making, while still maintaining a high level of data pro-
tection, inclusivity and general support for local priorities such as economic
development and cultural heritage.
In terms of data infrastructures, cities have been at the forefront of
embracing the open data movement. The release of data sets to the public
has increased transparency and provided early innovation potential for third
party stakeholders. Services such as Citymapper3 show how open data can
add great beneﬁts to the journey experiences of citizens.
Many cities have invested in the setup of open data portals and pro-
actively encourage stakeholders across public departments and the private
sector to contribute data sets. At the same time, cities are trying to engage
entrepreneurs and communities to innovate around these data stores. Early
results are promising, but static or sporadically changing data sets have their
limitations.

IoT infrastructures are increasingly becoming an important element in
providing the underpinning digital layer of smart city services. They augment
the open data sets with rich real-time information about public infrastructure
conditions and city processes that can be exploited for a more responsive
delivery of public services. Examples range from an improved mobility expe-
rience through adaptive trafﬁc management and multi-modal transportation to
resource savings achieved by smart street light control, waste collection and
irrigation management.
Various demonstrations of such systems are emerging globally showing
the beneﬁts of data-driven services based on IoT and data infrastructures.
However, many of these systems currently operate in silos both in terms
of the technology employed and the operating environments of the city.
Interoperability issues and lack of economies of scale make many potential
business cases still hard to justify and result in a lack of conﬁdence in the
market.
SynchroniCity aims to overcome the existing barriers in the market by
fostering the emergence of a digital single market for smart city services. It
8.5 SynchroniCity: Delivering a Digital Single Market
251
brings eight European cities together to work on a common blueprint for IoT
and data infrastructures with standardized interfaces and information models,
creating an environment that allows vendors and solution providers to more
openly compete.
Our vision is to move from disparate data stores and city platforms
to vibrant marketplaces for urban data and services providing adequate
incentives for a variety of stakeholders to participate. For providers of IoT
infrastructure and other urban data sources, this should provide a trusted
environment to generate reliable revenue ﬂows. For application and service
developers, it should allow frictionless access to reliable and trusted urban
data streams to be used as assets underpinning the innovation no matter
what city is involved. We call this aspect “avoiding city lock-in”. Cities
and infrastructure providers can beneﬁt from an aligned environment with
standardised interfaces to access a diverse pool of vendor solutions able
to compete fairly on price and performance. We call this aspect “avoiding
vendor lock-in”. Together, they form the robust underpinnings of a global
market for IoT-enabled urban services.
8.5.2 Technical and Non-Technical Barriers of Creating a Smart
City Eco-System
SynchroniCity addresses a wide range of technological and non-technological
barriers that need to be overcome to enable necessary economies of scale and
market conﬁdence to emerge.
The key technological barriers include:
• Lack of standardized multi-vendor ecosystem, leading to fear of vendor
lock-in for many cities;
• Lack of common service provisioning environments across cities, lead-
ing to fear of city lock-in for service developers as they need to
“redevelop” major parts of their apps and renegotiate access to different
data sources for every city;
• Close coupling of IoT infrastructure and applications, leading to IoT
solution silos and limited infrastructure reuse;
• Lack of tools, license models and platforms to facilitate the incentivized
sharing of urban IoT data and other relevant data sets;
• Lack of harmonized business practice and legal frameworks across
cities – making IoT infrastructure roll out and launch of new services
tedious across different geographies;
252
IoT European Large-Scale Pilots – Integration, Experimentation and Testing
• Lack of understanding of privacy and personal data protection implica-
tions – making it difﬁcult to fully leverage data of citizens collected in
public spaces in responsible way; and
• Lack of conﬁdence in adopting emerging technologies due to increasing
technology ﬂuidity – rapid change and emergence of new standards
make it hard for cities to understand where sustainable investments can
be made.
Besides technological challenges, cities offer unique constraints and non-
technological barriers, which hamper the adoption of IoT technologies. They
include:
• Economical costs and budget constraints make it difﬁcult to for cities to
make major investments in newly emerging technologies;
• Inﬂexible public tender processes and procurement models complicate
experimental exploration with new technology solutions;
• Frequent political changes and reliance on election cycles leads often to
reprioritisation and lack of continuity to focus on longer term innovation
programmes;
• Lack of a holistic smart city strategy leads to investments in fragmented
systems for different verticals, making it difﬁcult to capitalise across
these and gain cost savings; and
• Lack of involvement of citizens and support from these can lead to smart
city solutions not addressing real citizen needs and fuel the mistrust of
citizen in adopting new technology solutions.
8.5.3 SynchroniCity Technical Approach
Overcoming the barriers identiﬁed above requires a common approach
across the different reference zones. In the following we introduce the key
foundations for our vision of the SynchroniCity digital single market.
Technical barriers 1–3 and in part 7 demand a common reference archi-
tecture for smart city platforms. A standardised reference architecture, which
is widely adopted among many cities with clearly deﬁned components and
interfaces is fundamental to overcome vendor lock-in. It will boost market
conﬁdence and lay down the foundations for the required economies of scale.
Key elements in this reference architecture are common north- and south-
bound interfaces. Technical barrier 4 demands new market place enablers
that encourage sharing of urban IoT data and other relevant data sets among
8.5 SynchroniCity: Delivering a Digital Single Market
253

different stakeholders. Lastly, barriers 5–6 relate to ﬁnding agreement on
common principles of governance of a digital single market.
Figure 8.17 shows an overview of the proposed components of the Syn-
chroniCity single market place including common north- and southbound
interfaces. A further important feature is the market place enablers that
underpin a thriving business eco-system around IoT data streams, actuation
capabilities and other urban data sources. In the following we brieﬂy describe
each of these.
A common reference architecture for smart city platforms. A standard-
ized reference architecture, which is widely adopted among cities with clearly
deﬁned components and interfaces, is fundamental to overcome vendor lock-
in. It will boost market conﬁdence and lay down the foundations for the
required economies of scale.
Common northbound interfaces. Developers require a common, homoge-
neous and IoT independent way to access data from the devices infrastructure,
but also from any other subsystem in the city that can provide valuable
information to develop smart services and applications. More speciﬁcally, this
includes 1) a common standard API for context information management;
2) a common set of information models enabling actual interoperability of
applications; and 3) a set of common standards data publication platforms
254
IoT European Large-Scale Pilots – Integration, Experimentation and Testing
have to comply with, enabling the harvesting of data coming from multiple
federated platforms as well as the publication of real-time open data.
Common southbound interfaces. For IoT device vendors and manufacturers
it should become easier to offer suitable device stacks for integrating hetero-
geneous IoT components into a common environment, together with a market
place for compliant IoT products and solutions.
Market place enablers. These should encourage sharing of urban IoT data
and other relevant data sets among different stakeholders. By providing a mar-
ket place as a one-stop-shop, it will become much easier for data consumers
to discover and access urban data sources. The availability of a trusted market
place with monetization mechanisms will allow third parties to generate eas-
ier revenue streams from their urban data sources. This will encourage more
businesses to share currently closed data sources or incentivize deployments
of new IoT infrastructure as secondary revenue streams can be generated,
making more business cases viable. Data consumers may not require lengthy
negotiations of license terms as data license terms can be negotiated from
pre-conﬁgured options of the provider on the ﬂy.
8.5.4 SynchroniCity Applications
Based on the shared architecture, SynchroniCity will deliver IoT-enabled
urban services in the eight reference zone cities. The services will be
developed and delivered in an ambitious two-stage approach.
First phase consists of three initial applications, based on the highest
priorities among the members of the global Open & Agile Smart Cities
initiative, a network of more than 100 cities worldwide which includes the
SynchroniCity reference zones:
• Community Policy Suite
• Context-adaptive trafﬁc management
• Multi-modal transportation
These applications are fairly standard services nowadays. However, there
are still signiﬁcant gaps when it comes to actually delivering them at scale,
based on digital single market principles. Not all the SynchroniCity cities are
involved in the deployment of all the initial applications.
The following phase is called “enrichment of the eco-system”, and it adds
another wave of new applications to the SynchroniCity portfolio, based on
an open call where new companies and cities may propose applications and
services built on top of the SynchroniCity architectural principles.
8.5 SynchroniCity: Delivering a Digital Single Market
255
Figure 8.18
Interactive light art in Eindhoven.
A total of 3 million Euros has been allocated for the new applications, and
the call for participation will launch in the spring of 2018.
Taken together, the applications developed and deployed at large scale
in SynchroniCity will form a substantial contribution to a global market for
IoT-enabled urban services.
8.5.5 Impact Creation
SynchroniCity consists of eight core reference zones in as many cities, but
the ambition is to go well beyond this starting point: beyond the reference
zone to the entire city, beyond a single silo to span multiple domains, and to
go beyond Europe.
To reach this goal, the project was founded on a strong partnership basis
with existing initiatives and communities, and has deﬁned a set of ambitious
KPIs.
At the core of SynchroniCity is the Open & Agile Smart Cities initiative
(OASC)4 which is a global network of national networks of more than
4www.oascities.org
256
IoT European Large-Scale Pilots – Integration, Experimentation and Testing
100 cities in 23 countries that are working together to contribute to the
establishment of a simple set of mechanisms for technical interoperability and
comparability based on the needs of cities, i.e. the demand-side in the market.
By adding global partners in Mexico, USA, Korea and Brazil, SynchroniCity
spans a large diversity which is a characteristic of a global market. Potentially,
the entire OASC network can easily adapt and deploy the SynchroniCity
applications. Figure 8.15 shows the European reference zones, the global
partners and the OASC cities.
A key focus of SynchroniCity is to contribute to the development of
common speciﬁcations and ultimately standards. As shown in Figure 8.19
below, SynchroniCity takes input not only from OASC and the cities directly
involved in the project, but also from other large initiatives, including promi-
nently the FIWARE5 initiative and the European Innovation Partnership on
Smart Cities and Communities (EIP-SCC)6. Through targeted activities and
deliverables as well as participation directly in the speciﬁcation and standards
development, SynchroniCity is contributing directly to a number of streams,
including the ETSI Industry Speciﬁcation Group on Context Information
Management (ETSI ISG CIM)7, the ITU-T Focus Group on Data Process-
ing and Management for Smart Cities and Communities (FG-DPM)8, and
ISO/TC 268 on Sustainable cities and communities9. The project actively
supports and contributes to the UN Sustainable Development Goals10.
By having the open call where actors outside of the SynchroniCity project
consortium are invited to enrich the eco-system, SynchroniCity actively seeks
to facilitate support and impact beyond the closed group of initial partners.
8.5.6 Conclusions and Outlook
SynchroniCity has a clear ambition to deliver local value in cities and commu-
nities based on the global dynamics of digital connectivity, innovation power
and capital. So far, efforts to create a global multi-sided market based on
demand-side needs have not been successful. With the approach described
above, the partners in the SynchroniCity consortium propose an approach

which leverages interests from both sides of the market, with a clear focus on
having humans in the centre. Together with the rest of the IoT Large Scale
Pilot projects, SynchroniCity will hopefully bring Europe and the world a step
closer to a well-functioning market, based on human needs and life between
the systems.
8.6 AUTOPILOT – Automated Driving Progressed by
Internet of Things
“AUTOmated driving Progressed by Internet Of Things” (AUTOPILOT) is
a three-year project that started in January 2017, receiving funding from the
European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme. The
AUTOPILOT consortium, consisting of 45 partners, represents all relevant
areas of the Internet of Things (IoT) eco-system. Its overall objective to
enable safer highly automated driving through smart and connected objects –
the IoT11.

IoT European Large-Scale Pilots – Integration, Experimentation and Testing
8.6.1 Project Overview
During the last decade, numerous IoT technologies have been developed by
the research community, including IoT software engineering tools and tech-
niques, schemes for safeguarding security/privacy as well as infrastructures.
Built upon these recently ﬁnished or ongoing research and innovation activi-
ties, AUTOPILOT focuses on utilising the IoT potential for automated driving
and on making data from autonomous cars available to the IoT. In particular,
AUTOPILOT aims to bring together relevant knowledge and technology
from automotive and IoT value chains in order to develop IoT-architectures
and platforms to explore the growing market for mobility services. IoT-
enabled autonomous cars are tested, in real conditions, at six large-scale
sites, whose test results will allow multi-criteria evaluations (technical, user,
business, legal) of the IoT impact on pushing the level of autonomous
driving.
8.6.1.1 Objective
Connectivity and the ability to collect data from thousands of objects sur-
rounding vehicles are key enablers for highly automated driving. The IoT
provides the mechanisms and tools to create virtual objects in the Cloud
from real connected objects, thereby allowing these objects to become more
automated in the not-so-distant future.
Overall, AUTOPILOT pursues ﬁve main objectives. First, it seeks to
enhance the vehicle’s understanding of its environment, utilising IoT sensors.
Second, the project sets out to foster innovation in automotive IoT and
mobility services. Third, it wants to use and evaluate advanced vehicle-
to-everything connectivity technologies. Fourth, AUTOPILOT is designed
to involve users, public services and businesses to assess the IoT’s socio-
economic beneﬁts. Last, the project aims to contribute to the standardisation
of IoT eco-systems worldwide.
More concretely, AUTOPILOT proceeds in four steps (see Figure 8.20).
On large-scale test sites, data is collected in an IoT eco-system, deﬁned as
“objects in the physical world, which are capable of being identiﬁed and
integrated into communication networks”. Next, this data is collated and
Figure 8.20

8.6 AUTOPILOT – Automated Driving Progressed by Internet of Things
259
analysed in an IoT Platform, deﬁned as “interconnecting things based on
existing and evolving interoperable ICTs”, which is speciﬁcally dedicated
to Automated Driving (see Section 8.6.2.1). The IoT Platform is then used
for four use cases to test applications on Automated Driving (see Section
8.6.2.2). Ultimately, AUTOPILOT suggests some services, which can serve
as business models for translating IoT Applications (see Section 8.6.2.3) into
tangible offers for end users of automated driving.
8.6.1.2 Partners
The AUTOPILOT consortium brings together 45 partners from multiple
countries and diverse backgrounds. The consortium is a balanced mix of
organisations working in IoT as well as in Automation. This cooperation
is an asset, because both industries have a very different approach to data
sharing and vehicle control. IoT devices are by deﬁnition shared and open
while automotive electronics are closed and safety-critical. The partner con-
stellation in AUTOPILOT helps to overcome this problem and thus fosters
implementation of IoT solutions in future vehicle architecture. The idea
behind the consortium is to combine a wide range of knowledge areas
to foster the project’s effectiveness in attaining its objectives. Lastly, the
AUTOPILOT consortium provides an avenue for authorities into the project.
City authorities of the project sites are as much part of the consortium as are
road operators.
Overall, the AUTOPILOT consortium can be characterised in four clus-
ters: (1) those developing AD vehicles, (2) those developing IoT and net-
works, (3) those collecting data to evaluate the systems and their potential
impacts, and, (4) those potentially developing innovative services based on
the results. This comprehensive mix of partners is a key to the project.
8.6.2 Project Approach
AUTOPILOT follows a two-track approach, composed of both pragmatic and
conceptual platform development. On the one hand, the pragmatic architec-
ture serves not only as starting point for the development of the conceptual
and uniﬁed platform but also as starting point for the use cases at the different
Pilot Sites. On the other hand, the conceptual architecture is deployed very
early and can be used by any new development. The conceptual architecture
is to be used as the reference for discussion and collaboration with other
Large Scale Pilots. To swiftly achieve tangible results, AUTOPILOT utilises
pragmatically existing systems or other available installations.
260
IoT European Large-Scale Pilots – Integration, Experimentation and Testing
In addition, AUTOPILOT adopts an iterative approach for innovation
activities, known as Iterative and Incremental Development (IDD). The main
rationale for IID in the design phase is to allow the project to better adapt to
changing contexts, requirements, technological developments and boundary
conditions. Therefore, the requirements are not frozen at the early stage of
the project but will be reviewed based on preliminary evaluation results.
A maximum of three cycles is foreseen, whereas the need for applying
all cycles is likely to be different for the partners and Pilot Sites, according
to their level of maturity in IoT and automated driving at the start of the
project. The multiple cycle approach offers all partners the necessary level of
ﬂexibility concerning their participation in the project as well as harmonising
their contributions to the project.
The speciﬁc motivation for this approach in AUTOPILOT is threefold:
First, there is a technical justiﬁcation. One needs to merge the need to
integrate many different components, with the need to start from existing
solutions and adapt to users’ early feedbacks. Second, there is an organisa-
tional justiﬁcation, as Pilot Sites will learn from each other between cycles.
Third, there is a business justiﬁcation, as initial solutions to show on the
demand side can pointedly visualise the demand side to IoT solutions for
automated road transport.
8.6.2.1 AUTOPILOT’s IOT Platform
AUTOPILOT’s IoT Platform is held responsible on six parameters of design.
• Standard-Based: Legacy or proprietary IoT systems can be integrated
into a common system;
• Abstraction: Abstraction-based information model following estab-
lished High-Level IoT Architecture;
• Federation: Private and public IoT systems can co-exist and collaborate
on-demand;
• Semantic: Based on formal semantics to achieve automated processing
of large variety of information;
• Functional Distribution: Architecture enabling functional elements to be
allocated into systems;
• Security: Provision of security functions and implementation of the
“Privacy-by-Design” principles.
Today’s IoT installations are mainly Intranet-of-Things meaning closed sys-
tems developed for a single commercial purpose and all following the same
design principles. But the vision of AUTOPILOT is calling for an open IoT
8.6 AUTOPILOT – Automated Driving Progressed by Internet of Things
261
system, in which many participants are publishing and consuming IoT data
and services. This is alike the Internet in which many participants can operate
their own Web site. As shown with traditional Web-based systems, there is a
need for aggregation and federation services, supporting developer and end-
user with high-quality services (e.g. Google search, hotel booking engines,
news aggregation services).
Those services are especially needed in the IoT for autonomous driving
areas. Automated driving service operators will prefer to use a single ser-
vice, delivering high quality and reliable information, rather than having to
interface with thousands of information sources and service providers. This is
called the IoT Federation, where autonomous systems agreed to collaborate
by exchanging data and providing services to each other. The AUTOPILOT
conceptual architecture provides such federation mechanism following the
federation design principle. For example, for data access the FIWARE IoT
Broker provides a large-scale federation infrastructure. Federation enables a
ﬁner grain control over IoT information compared to centralised IoT clouds.
Federation also enables privacy-by-design thanks to clear policies and control
points for information access.
Today’s autonomous driving applications are relying on autonomous
vehicle systems in which the needed information is gathered, processed and
analysed on the vehicles themselves. As a consequence, the vehicle platform
can base its driving and manoeuvring decisions solely on local information
(Autonomous Car Zone). In the past year, newer approaches for cooperative
driving have emerged, where driving functions take information gathered
from other devices into account, e.g. using Car2Car or Car2Infra approaches
(Cooperation Zone). With the emergence of the IoT, autonomous driving
services can utilise IoT devices from the surrounding as well as services from
the Cloud
8.6.2.2 Project Sites and Applications
AUTOPILOT employs large numbers of vehicles under normal trafﬁc con-
ditions, for which trials are being conducted at six large-scale Pilot Sites
(Table 8.2).
• The Finnish Pilot Site, located in Tampere provides different outdoor
conditions, such as slippery intersection in winter time, low visibility
for environment perception sensors due to fog.
• The French Pilot Site is located in downtown Versailles, close to the
castle. Its goal is to provide mobility services for tourists, based on a
small ﬂeet of automated vehicles and dedicated to a car-sharing.
262
IoT European Large-Scale Pilots – Integration, Experimentation and Testing
• The Italian Pilot Site, is a testing infrastructure encompassing the
Florence-Livorno highway together with road access to the settlement
around the Livorno seaport.
• The Korean Pilot Site in Daejeon focuses on road situation information
at an intersection, which is challenging for automated vehicles because
of the large number of obstacles to be encountered there.
• The Dutch Pilot consists of three different test areas, including the
Eindhoven University campus, the automotive campus parking, and a
6 km stretch of the A270 motorway.
• The Spanish Pilot Site is located in Vigo, covering the city’s main street.
It provides an operational test on cooperative systems between different
types of vehicles and for underground parking.
AUTOPILOT deploys four different automated driving use cases: Automated
Valet Parking (AVP) is a driverless Automated Driving use case including
on-street car drop-off, driving to and from a parking spot, forwards and back-
wards manoeuvring as well as on-street passenger pick-up. The IoT allows
this use case to be a Level 4 scenario, since data and control from different
infrastructure sensors is essential. IoT functions include routing (parking
availability through sensors), localisation of obstacles (parking cameras) and
even control decision making at the IoT Edge.
Table 8.2
AUTOPILOT project sites and applications
8.6 AUTOPILOT – Automated Driving Progressed by Internet of Things
263
Highway Use is a use case focused on Automated Driving on motorways
from entrance to exit, on all lanes, incl. overtaking. The driver must deliber-
ately activate the system, but does not have to monitor the system constantly.
There are no requests from the system to the driver to take over when the
systems in normal operation area (i.e. on the motorway). Depending on the
deployment of cooperative systems ad-hoc convoys could also be created if
V2V communication is available.
The use case for Platooning is an Automated Driving scenario where fully
automated driving or driverless vehicles will join and drive in a platoon, with
a leading vehicle in front. The driving mode is very similar to the Highway
Pilot, however driving in a platoon requires the vehicle to use advanced V2V
communications. Two variants of platooning will be deployed and evaluated
in AUTOPILOT, an urban one and a highway one.
The Urban Driving use case is based on the ERTRAC “Fully automated
private vehicle” representing the SAE level 5, where “The fully automated
vehicle should be able to handle all driving from point A to B, without any
input from the passenger.”
8.6.2.3 Services the intersection of IoT and automation
As stipulated in its acronym, AUTOPILOT seeks to foster the progress of
automated driving. For this purpose, it makes use of the innovation of IoT
developments in the ﬁeld. Throughout the project, members of the consor-
tium will work to develop eight speciﬁc services that draw on the use case
applications of IoT (see Table 8.3). These services fulﬁl a double function.
On the one hand, they make the idea of automated driving progressed through
the IoT tangible for end users. On the other hand, they suggest viable business
models for stakeholders that will carry on the ﬁndings of AUTOPILOT even
after it ended.
8.6.3 Project Impact
To provide quantitative and qualitative evidence of the added value of IoT
technology for automated driving, all large-scale Pilot tests are evaluated
using the established FESTA methodology. The added value is formulated
in hypotheses on objectives, ambitions and impact, and is measured in Key
Performance Indicators (KPIs) or metrics from several perspectives. Data
analyses and (technical) evaluation will be executed simultaneously with
piloting to provide immediate feedback on test executing and input for the
next iteration of development.

IoT based automated driving services
AUTOPILOT will focus on using standard-based IoT to ensure deploying
interoperable and replicable IoT platforms and architectures. It will verify
the interoperability and functionality during the development phase. Security
and privacy by design will be a key impact of AUTOPILOT. Additionally,
AUTOPILOT will deploy and evaluate several business services contributing
or using automated driving. In this, the project will have to assess possibly

competing elements of user acceptance, such as the perceived usability,
ethical aspects and liability.
Overall, AUTOPILOT will pilot the use cases in a real public and private
environment, with the consent and strong support of the City councils, some
being in the consortium. Services like car sharing, city chauffeur and auto-
mated valet parking are expected to increase citizens’ quality of life. The Pilot
Sites, with their different automated driving use cases and business partners
are an instrument to attract new entrepreneurs for creating further business
opportunities. AUTOPILOT will promote the IoT as key enabler for automate
driving and the related new business models linked with the IoT eco-system.
8.7 CREATE-IoT Cross Fertilisation through Alignment,
Synchronisation and Exchanges for IoT
CREATE-IoT is the coordination and support action involving all IoT Euro-
pean Large-Scale Pilots innovation actions projects, articulating altogether
the IoT European Large-Scale Pilots Programme that is built around eight
activity groups. Through an active participation of these activity groups, IoT
Large-Scale Pilot projects are able to contribute to the consolidation and
coherence work that is implemented by the CREATE-IoT and U4IOT. This
is done by supporting the clustering activities deﬁned by the Programme and
addressing issues of common interest such as interoperability approach, stan-
dards, security and privacy approaches, business validation and sustainability,
methodologies, metrics, etc.
The ultimate goal of the IoT European Large-Scale Pilots Programme
and the coordination/collaboration activities is to increase the impact of
the activities and development in the IoT Large-Scale Pilots on citizens,
public and private spheres, industry, businesses and public services. The
activity groups are key enablers for the identiﬁcation of key performance
indicators to measure progress on citizen beneﬁts, economic growth, jobs
creation, environment protection, productivity gains, etc. The coordination
mechanisms implemented through the activity groups will help to ensure
a sound coherence and exchange between the various activities of the IoT
Focus Area, and cross fertilisation of the various pilots for technological and
validation issues of common interest across the various use cases.
The issues of horizontal nature and topics of common interest, for all
IoT Large-Scale Pilot projects, such as privacy, security, user acceptance,
266
IoT European Large-Scale Pilots – Integration, Experimentation and Testing

IoT European Large-Scale Pilots Programme Activity Groups.
standardisation, creativity, societal and ethical aspects, legal issues and inter-
national cooperation, etc., are coordinated by the activity groups (Figure 8.21)
and consolidated across the pilots to maximise the output and to prepare the
ground for the next stages of deployment including pre-commercial or joint
public procurement.
The activity groups support and foster links between communities of IoT
users and providers, with Member States’ initiatives, and with other initiatives
including contractual Public-Private-Partnerships (e.g. Big Data, Factories of
the Future, 5G-infrastructure), Joint Technology Initiatives (e.g. ECSEL),
European Innovation Partnerships (e.g. on Smart Cities), and other Focus
Areas (e.g. on Autonomous transport).
The activity groups monitor that appropriate mechanisms are put in place
so that pilots’ impact can go beyond involved partners by also reaching
external communities and stakeholders. Special attention should be given
to those pilot projects which intend to launch open calls through cascade
funding. Mobilising a wider community beyond the consortium is essential
for the development of a secure and sustainable European IoT ecosystem.
Beyond sustaining an ecosystem it is instrumental to include contributions
to assure that the IoT infrastructures developed and implemented are viable
beyond the duration of the Pilots.
The IoT European Large-Scale Pilots Programme coordination body led
by the supporting and coordination actions, being CREATE-IoT part of it,
will continuously monitor and adapt through the activity groups the com-
mon topics, challenges, best practices in order to maximise the expected
impact of the IoT Large-Scale Pilots and coordination actions as outlined
below:

various parts of the initiative (pilots, research, horizontal actions).
• Efﬁcient information sharing across the programme stakeholders for
horizontal issues of common interests.
• Extension and consolidation of the EU IoT community, including start-
ups and SMEs.
• Validation of technologies’ deployment and replicability towards opera-
tional deployment.
• Validation, in usage context of most promising standards and gap
identiﬁcation.
• Strengthening of the role of EU on the global IoT scene, in particular in
terms of access to foreign markets.
8.7.1 Introduction
CREATE-IoT brings together 19 partners from 9 European countries. The
project objectives are to stimulate collaboration between IoT initiatives, foster
the take up of IoT in Europe and support the development and growth of
IoT ecosystems based on open technologies and platforms. This requires
synchronisation and alignment on strategic and operational terms through
268
IoT European Large-Scale Pilots – Integration, Experimentation and Testing

CREATE-IoT activities.
frequent, multi-directional exchanges between the various activities under the
IoT Focus Areas as depicted in Figure 8.22. It addresses cross fertilisation of
the various IoT Large Scale Pilots for technological and validation issues
of common interest across the various application domains and use cases.
The project fosters the exchange on requirements for legal accompanying
measures, development of common methodologies and KPIs for design,
testing and validation and for success and impact measurement, federation
of pilot activities and transfer to other pilot areas, facilitating the access for
IoT entrepreneurs/API developers/makers, SMEs, including combination of
ICT and art.
CREATE-IoT takes a holistic approach in facilitating the exchange
between the different IoT Large-Scale Pilot projects and providing the appro-
priate platform and tools that will enable fruitful cross-fertilization between
IoT Large-Scale Pilots.
8.7.2 Conceptual Approach
CREATE-IoT aims to provide support to the different activities covered
by the IoT Focus Area through the development of a coherent strategy
for open exchanges and collaboration between the various actors involved.
CREATE-IoT is focusing on promoting and discovering synergies across the
different axes of the IoT Focus Area, as shown in Figure 8.23. The horizontal
nature of (personal) data protection, security, user acceptance, standardisa-
tion, interoperability, creativity, societal and ethical aspects, legal issues and
international cooperation are coordinated across the whole IoT ecosystem.
Special attention is paid to the Large-Scale Pilots, but also to other initiatives
8.7 CREATE-IoT Cross Fertilisation through Alignment, Synchronisation
269

CREATE-IoT project axes.
in the IoT Focus Area, and other related initiatives at EU and global level
involving different IoT communities, technology and innovation platforms,
etc. The project boosts synergies, experience and knowledge sharing towards
the creation of an inclusive IoT ecosystem, by deﬁning a set of best practices
and business models that will facilitate the replication of results and, thus,
improve the overall impact of the parallel on-going activities, in particular
the IoT Large-Scale Pilot projects. In summary, CREATE-IoT is working on:
• Ensuring coherent exchanges between the various activities of the Focus
Area, and cross fertilisation of the various pilots for technological and
validation issues of common interest across the various use cases.
• Supporting and assessing the current IoT Large-Scale Pilot projects,
sharing best practices and aligning horizontal issues.
• Developing a more inclusive ecosystem where innovation, art and
creativity take active part on it.
• Proposing a framework for the coherent integration of the EU IoT value
chain, strengthening the links between different on-going initiatives in
the IoT domain.
• Fostering interoperability of existing and future IoT solutions.
270
IoT European Large-Scale Pilots – Integration, Experimentation and Testing
• Implementing and developing a policy framework in the IoT domain
addressing the current horizontal issues that prevent the from massive
deployment of IoT solutions, with a special focus on the trust and legal
domains.
The project methodology is based on a clear deﬁnition of the current IoT
ecosystem. The work provides the overall foundation for common inter-
linking and coordination activities: all relevant stakeholders, technologies,
reference architectures and business models will be the base over which
the project will grow. The support to the IoT Large-Scale Pilot projects,
as addressed by the project, fosters the sharing of experiences both from
technical and non-technical perspectives. On the technical side, CREATE-
IoT is focusing mainly on the federation of experiments and IoT reference
architectures, whilst the non-technical side aims at sharing experiences,
assessment methodologies and business models. The project exploits the
synergies between arts and IoT and position creativity and innovation as a key
driver and enabler for the progress of IoT. The methodology resulting from
this work is tested in the different LSPs. The project addresses the creation
of a framework for an integrated European IoT Value Chain that will grow
the links between communities of IoT users and providers, as well as with
Member States’ initiatives and other related initiatives in the IoT domain.
The development of a Policy Framework will help addressing the multiple
existing challenges, especially in the security and privacy domain, which
are hindering the wide adoption of IoT solutions. The requirements for
a trusted IoT label are under discussion. This label would better position
EU IoT solutions in the global markets, being applicable not only to the
whole IoT Focus Area, but also to other IoT domains. CREATE-IoT works
on supporting industrial consensus building for implementing pre-normative
and standardisation, coordinating the activities with Standard Developing
Organizations (i.e. ISO, ETSI, CEN/CENELEC, W3C, IETF, ITU, IEEE,
OGC, etc.) and other various IoT Global Alliances (AIOTI, IIC, Thread,
AllJoyn, Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF), etc.), thus aligning activities
at the national, European and global level.
8.7.3 Impact
CREATE-IoT provides the framework for supporting and coordinating the
IoT Focus Area, in order to foster the take up of IoT in Europe and enable the
emergence of IoT ecosystems supported by open technologies and platforms.
8.7 CREATE-IoT Cross Fertilisation through Alignment, Synchronisation
271
This is done through the coordination of complementary activities structured
around IoT Large-Scale Pilots
The project ensures the framework environment and provides tools to
ensure consistency and linkages between the pilots, complementing them by
addressing ethics and privacy, trust and security, respect for the scarcity and
vulnerability of human attention, validation and certiﬁcation, standards and
interoperability, user acceptability and control, liability and sustainability.
The project implements a coordination body that ensures an efﬁcient interplay
of the various elements of the IoT Focus Area and liaises with relevant
initiatives at EU, Member States and international levels.
For today’s and tomorrow’s IoT products, services, applications, solutions
infrastructure and ecosystems, it is crucial that the society, its citizens and
other (potential) customers and users have trust in what they use, buy, wish
to enjoy or are connected to. In order to create a workable level of such trust
and therewith durable adoption, one will need to have comfort, the offer will
need to be credible and usable. In that scope, concepts such as ethics, safety,
accountability, security and privacy by design have to be widely spread from
the early stages of development for IoT products, services, applications, solu-
tions infrastructure and ecosystems. To enable large scale deployments of IoT
systems ensuring massive and durable user adoption, it will be essential that
IoT and related IoT ecosystems are based on complementary architectures
based on similar principles, enabling to leverage across multiple use cases and
to catch the extra value arising from information exchange across multiple
sectors/domains.
The goal of the CREATE-IoT project is to put in place an approach that
can federate the IoT Large-Scale Pilots and, beyond them, other IoT and
related ecosystems that are deployed worldwide. Given that IoT applications
are meant to affect the living environment with minimum involvement from
the human side, security breaches may have direct impact on human safety,
and the privacy may be compromised by communications that happen without
being noticed. Furthermore, security in IoT environment is more challenging
to be achieved than in the traditional Internet of computers, due to power,
bandwidth and computing constraints. Therefore, it tends to be neglected
in early deployments despite its high criticality. In addition, the privacy
risk requires speciﬁc overall horizontal attention across initiatives, because
exposure of multiple anonymized data about the life, from home energy
consumption to public transport infrastructure usage and ofﬁce activities,
facilitates link ability to individual identity, eventually compromising the pri-
vacy of each anonymous data. These aspects deserve speciﬁc attention in the
272
IoT European Large-Scale Pilots – Integration, Experimentation and Testing
supervision activities. There are many new ethical, legal and related questions
and queries that need to be structured, addressed, clariﬁed and sometimes
rethought. There are many layers in any IoT vertical and horizontal matters
such as for instance (personal) data protection, data management, security,
product liability and net neutrality rise not once, but actually several times per
layer. There are quite some layers necessary in order to build an IoT vertical,
let alone the many cross-vertical data value chains and liabilities that need to
be addressed.
CREATE-IoT has an important and critical impact on potential barriers,
on providing the stakeholders with multi-angle and sufﬁcient knowledge,
with a trusted environment for the development of IoT, and with compre-
hensive technical and non-technical practical landscaped guidelines, mecha-
nisms, best practices and other legal and related knowledge, and on giving
support to projects across the IoT Focus Area. The ultimate aim is to create
the Trusted IoT concept.
CREATE-IoT’s expected impact is in ensuring that start-ups, developers
and SMEs are able to play a role in the new IoT paradigm. One of the
requirements is that the platforms deployed across the IoT Focus Areas must
be open to enable sustainability and continued innovation and development
of new cases. By ensuring that there are appropriate support mechanisms for
SMEs and start-up participation, CREATE-IoT is working to:
• Enable start-ups and SMEs to engage with the IoT Large-Scale Pilot
projects and build the skills and technology base they need to be part of
the IoT ecosystem.
• Provide clarity about legal considerations on privacy and other related
topics.
• Invite disruptive innovation from stakeholders who have no proprietary
technology or legacy considerations.
• Ensure that the voice of smaller and new businesses across Europe can
be heard in the debates on standards and interoperability.
• Lay the foundations for truly open (although not necessarily free of
charge) platforms that withstand changes in any given ecosystem.
The longer-term impact of the support to SMEs is seen in Europe’s ability to
compete on the world stage with new companies that can contribute to the
creation of skilled jobs and economic growth. CREATE-IoT creates impact
through the development and implementation of a methodology to integrate
artistic practices and creation in IoT innovation, adoption and market pen-
etration. The exploitation of the combination of ICT and the arts has direct
8.8 U4IoT – User Engagement for Large Scale Pilots in the Internet of Things
273
impact on IoT Large-Scale Pilots and Focus Area by enhancing a bottom-
up user adoption and introducing a critical approach to technology in the
design, development, dissemination of new products, technologies, services
and experiences in various IoT application domains.
The expected impact resulting from the combination of ICT and the arts
can be summarized in few points:
• Increased user adoption and conﬁdence in IoT systems and IoT Large-
Scale Pilots thanks to the consideration of user-centric methodologies
and consumer-citizens assessment while emerged in IoT systems and
experiences.
• Boost of socially driven innovation processes in IoT thanks to co-
creation methodologies and a solid critical approach enabled by artists
attributing meanings to technologies.
• Enhanced promptness to innovate and enhanced EU ICT competitive-
ness driven by the emerging hybrid ﬁeld of ICT and the Arts supported
by the EU Digital Agenda STARTS initiative.
• Consolidation of an EU IoT Art-Science cluster of practitioners that can
extend the impact of CREATE-IoT beyond its time frame and scope.
8.8 U4IoT – User Engagement for Large Scale Pilots
in the Internet of Things
This chapter presents the U4IoT Coordination and Support Action which
aims at supporting end-user engagement in the ﬁve European Large-Scale
Pilots. It comprises a short introduction of the project objectives followed by
a review of the various strands of work aimed at achieving those objectives
including enshrining participants’ right to privacy and the protection of their
personal data.
8.8.1 Introduction
U4IoT will support the Large Scale Pilots (LSPs) funded by the European
Commission in the context of the Horizon 2020 research programme. It will
enable a citizen-driven process by combining multidisciplinary expertise and
complementary mechanisms from state-of-the-art European organisations.
It will also analyse societal, ethical, and ecological issues related to the
pilots in order to develop recommendations for tackling IoT adoption barriers
including educational needs and skill-building.
274
IoT European Large-Scale Pilots – Integration, Experimentation and Testing
U4IoT combines a wide range of knowledge and experience from a
number of leading European partners in end-user engagement through crowd-
sourcing, Living Labs, co-creative workshops, and meetups designed to
support end-user engagement in the Large Scale Pilots. Its strategy is built
on four main sets of activities. It will:
• Develop a toolkit to facilitate the LSPs’ end-user engagement and adop-
tion activities including: online resources and tools for end-user engage-
ment; privacy-compliant crowdsourcing & crowdsensing tools and
surveys to assess end-users’ acceptance of the pilots; online resources
and an innovative game that will promote awareness of privacy and per-
sonal data protection risks with guidelines on personal data protection;
• Support and mobilise: end-user engagement through the training and
supporting of the LSP teams so that they may organise their own co-
creative workshops; meetups; training on the use of crowdsourcing &
crowdsensing tools in an efﬁcient and privacy-friendly way in line with
IoT Lab12 tools; the presentation and facilitation of Living Labs support;
an online pool of experts for end-user engagement; online training
modules.
• Analyse societal, ethical, and ecological issues related to the pilots’
end-users and make recommendations based on the analysis of IoT
adoption barriers and how to tackle them including education and skill-
building. It will leverage on end-user interactions to design participatory
sustainability models that can be replicated across LSPs and future IoT
pilots.
• Support communication, knowledge-sharing, and dissemination includ-
ing: the development of an interactive website with an online toolkit as
well as online knowledge database on lessons learned, FAQs, solutions,
and end-user feedback. It will support the end-user communication and
outreach strategies for LSPs and will enable information-sharing and
retro-feed towards LSPs and their end-users.
8.8.2 Engaging End-Users throughout the Life of the LSPs
One of the key objectives of U4IoT is to support and promote end-user
engagement across the entire lifecycle of the Large Scale Pilots from design,
to implementation, through to assessment. More speciﬁcally, the project will
encourage and support:
12www.iotlab.eu
8.8 U4IoT – User Engagement for Large Scale Pilots in the Internet of Things
275
End-user engagement in the design phase of the LSPs
U4IoT will provide methodologies, such as the co-creative workshops, that
will enable pilots to involve the local end-users from the beginning of the
project.
End-user engagement in the implementation phase of the LSPs
U4IoT will provide a complete set of tools to actively engage end-users in the
design and implementation of the pilots’ products and services.
End-user engagement in the exploitation and assessment phase
of the LSPs
Privacy-friendly crowdsourcing and survey tools will enable the pilots to
monitor end-user perception and acceptance of their projects during the
implementation phase. It will enable the pilots to identify issues that need to
be addressed so that they may maximise end-user acceptance and satisfaction.
This comprehensive approach is illustrated in Figure 8.24 below.
8.8.3 Embedding Personal Data Protection by Design
U4IoT will adopt a privacy-by-design approach. It will comply with the
new General Data Protection Regulation as well as other complementary
Figure 8.24
U4IoT overall concept.
276
IoT European Large-Scale Pilots – Integration, Experimentation and Testing
international (UN-, ITU-, and OECD-related norms) and European standards.
These include the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU (arts. 7 and 8), the
Treaty of Lisbon (arts. 16, 39, 88, and 169), Directives 95/46/EC, 97/66/EC,
2002/58/EC, 2002/21/EC, 2009/140/EC, 2009/136/EC, and Regulation(EC)
N◦45/2001.
U4IoT not only features expertise in personal data protection, but also has
experts on gaming methodologies. One intended outcome will be the creation
of a game whose aim is to raise awareness on privacy in connection with the
Internet of Things. This will help to better connect with end-users and raise
awareness of personal data protection issues and challenges they will face as
the technology achieves greater social penetration.
8.8.4 Developing an Ad Hoc Toolkit for End-User Engagement
U4IoT is developing a customised toolkit for end-user engagement in the
Large Scale Pilots, including:
Online resources for pilots including tools for end-user uptake
U4IoT will identify, gather, and provide relevant tools and online resources
for end-user engagement including strategic guidelines and steps for user
engagement and a pool of methodologies and tools to be used in different
states or steps in product and service co-design and co-creation. U4IoT will
provide resources supporting LSPs in engaging end-users in their pilots. The
online resources will be hosted on the project website. In addition, U4IoT will
compile these resources and advice into a practical handbook for the Internet
of Things pilot deployments. The handbook will also be designed to serve
future Internet of Things pilots.
Crowdsourcing and survey tools
U4IoT is leveraging and customising the crowdsourcing and crowd-
sensing tool developed by the European research project IoT Lab
(http://www.iotlab.eu). It enables researchers to collect fully anonymised
input and feedback from end-users through a smart phone application in order
to assess, ﬁne-tune, and validate end-user acceptance of IoT deployments. It
is particularly well-suited for large-scale IoT deployments.
Guidelines and an interactive game for privacy and personal data
protection
U4IoT will develop a game to educate and raise awareness on IoT and
privacy issues among the LSPs’ stakeholders and their end-users. Our goal
8.8 U4IoT – User Engagement for Large Scale Pilots in the Internet of Things
277
is to develop a game that fully integrates some basic concepts of privacy
(mainly online and IoT privacy) into a working and enjoyable mechanism
through which understanding such concepts becomes crucial to succeeding
in the game. Different versions of the game will be considered and an
interactive game will be developed in close collaboration with the partners of
the project and end-users. The game will highlight key concepts of personal
data protection such as: a priori informed consent, proﬁling, data processing,
anonymity, pseudonymity, etc. The game will focus on privacy issues related
to Smart Cities and the Internet of Things.
U4IoT website and dissemination
All presentations, documents, online tools, knowledge database, etc. will
be made available and maintained on the U4IoT website. Not only will it
document the activities of the project, but will also provide tools for interac-
tion with relevant projects and users. The website will be used as a source
for other promotion and dissemination channels such as social networks,
which will complement end-user engagement activities done “out and about”.
To this end, the “mood of the city” kiosk will be used as a means of attracting
interest and spreading information about the project and related activities.
Online knowledge database on lessons learned, solutions, and user
feedback
Another important element of the project is the development of a knowledge
base on lessons learned, solutions, and user feedback. It will be maintained
and regularly updated in order to capitalise on experiences and lessons
learned. At the end of the project, the knowledge base and online platform
will be formally transferred to the IoT Forum who has agreed to maintain it.
8.8.5 Supporting and Mobilising End-User Engagement
Beyond the development of tools, U4IoT considers that direct support to
the Large Scale Pilots is required as a complementary measure to enable
effective end-user engagement. A set of support actions and services are being
developed:
Co-creative workshops
Co-creative workshops can support end-user engagement in the early stages
of the LSPs by co-designing solutions in a multi-stakeholder setting. During
the workshop, collective knowledge of end-users, local stakeholders, and
278
IoT European Large-Scale Pilots – Integration, Experimentation and Testing
experts from LSPs is exchanged, combined, and captured. The co-creative
workshop methodology and toolkit enables experts to empathise with the
needs of end-users while end-users are empowered to communicate on an
expert level. The workshop program results in one or more use cases that are
co-created by the participants.
Analysing and converting the qualitative data gathered throughout the
workshop leads to a variety of functional requirements that are based on
end-user needs, however, designing, organising, facilitating, analysing, and
implementing co-creative workshops in LSPs can be challenging. U4IoT
therefore aims to offer a co-creative training program to increase end-user
engagement during the beginning of many LSPs in the IoT-1 call.
In this training program, experts from different LSPs are invited to learn
how to implement and utilise co-creative workshops in their projects. Experts
will interact directly with end-users through the co-creative workshops, ide-
ally increasing empathy and leading to more meaningful IoT-related solutions
that are based on the needs of end-users. More LSPs adopting the co-creative
workshop methodology will lower the threshold for involving end-users in
future LSPs and improve our knowledge on applying this methodology in
different contexts.
Living Labs methodology support
U4IoT will also provide the LSPs with Living Lab methodology support.
Here, the LSPs will get access to guidelines and services online regarding
how to apply Living Lab methodologies within the LSPs. Through this, the
LSPs get guidelines on how to develop open and user-driven innovation
ecosystems that support end-user engagement in the IoT pilots from the
early phases and throughout the whole pilot. In relation to this, U4IoT will
provide dedicated on-demand advisory support for the LSPs in Living Lab
approaches. This methodology support will mainly be provided as an online
tool with webinars and online supporting services.
Online pool of experts for end-user engagement
The U4IoT online training programme will assist LSPs to set up and deploy
an effective end-user engagement strategy. The components of the pro-
gramme consist of an interactive ﬂow-diagram, e-courses, example materials,
and an expert pool. The online pool will be a list of experts with details of
their speciﬁc expertise. The pool will be available online and is part of a front-
desk that also contains a list of end-user communities for open calls and a list
of FAQs. The LSPs can use the list to contact experts directly for questions
and answers or for custom advise and coaching on end-user engagement.
8.8 U4IoT – User Engagement for Large Scale Pilots in the Internet of Things
279
8.8.6 Recommendations on IoT Adoption and the Sustainability
of IoT Pilots
Tackling IoT adoption barriers
U4IoT will start by analysing societal, ethical, and ecological issues related
to the pilots with end-users and develop a set of corresponding recommen-
dations. This will be achieved by analysing IoT adoption barriers and pro-
vide guidelines for tackling these barriers, including educational needs and
skill-building.
Sustainability models for IoT pilots
U4IoT will design sustainability models for the LSPs. These models are
participatory and leverage on end-user interactions by involving not only the
LSPs themselves, but also their various stakeholders and target audiences,
from companies to public organisations to citizens. The U4IoT sustainability
models will be designed to help the LSPs and their stakeholders, but can also
be replicated in future IoT pilot deployment throughout Europe.”
8.8.7 Collaboration, Outreach, and Dissemination
A key factor of success for the project resides in its capacity to outreach
towards the relevant stakeholder. The collaboration, outreach and dissemina-
tion strategy is threefold:
Cooperation strategy with the LSPs
U4IoT will work in close interaction with the LSPs and will offer its sup-
port to each LSP consortium from the beginning of the project. U4IoT
will organise joint meetings and ad hoc training activities for all LSPs.
In parallel, U4IoT will collaborate closely with the other CSA and the
European Commission.
Cooperation strategy with the IoT Ecosystem and the IoT Forum
U4IoT will work closely with the IoT ecosystem and will contribute to the
visibility and outreach of the LSPs. U4IoT will also work closely with the
IoT Forum (chaired by MI), the AIOTI, the IERC, the ITU, and IEEE (more
details in Section 8.2).
The IoT Forum will play an important role in supporting the interaction
with the IoT research community, as well as in ensuring a long-term exploita-
tion and maintenance of the U4IoT online tools and platform.
280
IoT European Large-Scale Pilots – Integration, Experimentation and Testing
End-users outreach, engagement, and active involvement
U4IoT’s main users are the consortia leading the Large Scale Pilots imple-
mentation. The prime focus of U4IoT is to enable active participation and
engagement of ﬁnal end-users in the pilots. Beyond the end-user engagement
methodologies provided and developed in coordination with the pilots, U4IoT
will also provide transparent information on its website with resources made
available to ﬁnal end-users too.
8.8.8 A Systemic and Cybernetic Approach for End-User
Engagement
Through its aforementioned activities, U4IoT is following a fully integrated
and systematic approach. It intends to follow and enable a virtuous cycle by
collecting and internalising the feedback from the various stakeholders. The
model adopted by U4IoT is summarised in Figure 8.25.
The analytical part is central and enables us to develop the knowledge,
adapt and improve the support, and ﬁne-tune the tools. These elements are
then applied to the LSPs. The results are then monitored and analysed, closing
the loop.

8.8.9 Discussion
U4IoT stands as the primary support that the LSPs of the IoT-1 call will
use to engage with their audiences and develop deep connections with their
end-users. This will be achieved largely due to the extensive experience and
knowledge base of the U4IoT partners, which they will provide to the LSPs
both ofﬂine and online. Continuous support will be provided through our
online portal and via an expert pool that will cover all the relevant topics and
issues that the LSPs are likely to face in the realm of end-user engagement.
Expert knowledge will be accompanied and underpinned by technical
tools including state-of-the-art crowdsourcing technology, by a robust legal
framework, and by innovative engagement methodologies such as the privacy
game and co-creative workshops. All of this will be achieved while simulta-
neously accounting for societal, ethical, and ecological considerations.

Abstract: Wireless technologies are increasingly used in industrial applications. These technologies
reduce cabling, which is costly and troublesome, and introduce several beneﬁts for their application in
terms of ﬂexibility to modify the layout of the nodes and scaling of the number of connected devices.
They may also introduce new functionalities since they ease the connections to mobile devices or
parts. Although they have some drawbacks, they are increasingly accepted in industrial applications,
especially for monitoring and supervision tasks. Recently, they are starting to be accepted even for
time-critical tasks, for example, in closed-loop control systems involving slow dynamic processes.
However, wireless technologies have been evolving very quickly during the last few years, since
several relevant technologies are available in the market. For this reason, it may become difﬁcult to
select the best alternative. This perspective article intends to guide application designers to choose the
most appropriate technology in each case. For this purpose, this article discusses the most relevant
wireless technologies in the industry and shows different examples of applications.
Keywords: industrial Internet of Things (IIoT); wireless control systems; wireless sensor networks
(WSNs); Industry 4.0; cyber–physical systems (CPS)
1. Introduction
The fourth industrial revolution, commonly known as Industry 4.0, introduces new
concepts that enforce connectivity, such as cyber–physical systems (CPS), the Internet
of Things (IoT), and wireless sensor networks (WSNs) [1]. These concepts are aimed to
improve productivity and efﬁciency in manufacturing processes by connecting sensors,
actuators, and controllers, boosting the economy as a result [2,3]. Communication tech-
nologies are becoming key enablers in smart manufacturing processes since they ease
integration between cyber–physical production systems (CPPS), which are at the core of
Industry 4.0. In this scenario, communication technologies are evolving quite rapidly to be
able to satisfy the quality-of-service (QoS) needs of modern applications. These technolo-
gies are typically used in industrial applications for diverse tasks that involve monitoring,
predictive maintenance, supervision, and control operations.
Currently, wired solutions prevail in industrial domains. This is mainly because
several standards have reached a high degree of maturity. Some of them are based on
industrial Ethernet standards, such as Proﬁnet, Ethernet/IP, or EtherCAT. In fact, it is still
common to ﬁnd even older digital buses in use, such as Proﬁbus, CANbus, or Modbus.
These mature technologies are frequently considered safe and reliable, which are key issues
in some conservative industrial domains [4]. Wired technologies will clearly remain in use
in the future, especially in critical operations, such as closed-loop control over fast dynamic
processes. However, wired solutions have several drawbacks: Cabling is expensive and
difﬁcult to deploy, it produces not very ﬂexible layouts, and it is complex to use with

mobile devices or parts. Unfortunately, these drawbacks introduce some limitations in
applications using wired solutions.
In this scenario, wireless technologies enhance the interconnection capabilities at smart
factories, thus allowing fully intelligent manufacturing systems [5,6]. Their use may achieve
several beneﬁts: (1) introducing higher ﬂexibility to modify the layout of the links, which
eases the deployment of the nodes and improves scalability; (2) enhancing the connectivity
between decision-taking nodes and mobile devices or parts; and (3) eliminating wires,
which reduces the deployment cost. Wireless technologies are becoming key enablers in
different domains of the industry and, consequently, becoming increasingly relevant in
academia. In fact, during the last few years, their use has remarkably grown in industrial
environments. This trend is expected to follow during the next several years. A case in
point is the estimated number of connected devices worldwide in 2021, which was around
11.3 billion. This number is expected to reach 29.4 billion devices by 2030 [7].
However, wireless technologies have also some drawbacks that reduce their pre-
dictability and augment their error rate. The nature of wave propagation may cause diverse
phenomena that reduce the quality of service (QoS) of wireless applications. The most rele-
vant of these are fading, multipath propagation, shadowing, and interferences [8]. These
phenomena have an impact on the reliability, integrity, and security of communication
links when compared with wired communications. As a result, the bit-error rate increases,
which may cause uncertainty in the applications.
The introduction of wireless technologies in industrial facilities must face additional
challenges. On the one hand, many industrial applications require deterministic communi-
cation links in order to be accepted. Certain QoS parameters, such as the latency, jitter, and
error rate, must be bounded. On the other hand, they must operate in environments full of
metallic surfaces that may hinder wave propagation. This fact may cause difﬁculties given
the strict requirements in critical applications.
Currently, wireless technologies are frequently accepted in the industry for non-critical
applications, i.e., those that involve monitoring, alerting, or data-logging tasks. In these
cases, application failures do not have severe safety implications or do not produce large
economic losses. However, the use of these technologies in critical applications is still
under scrutiny. In fact, this is an interesting research topic that involves the mitigation of
the inﬂuence of interferences, some of them caused by different technologies, handling the
frequency spectrum adequately, and resolving collisions.
To date, no wireless technology has been developed to be valid for all applications. On
the contrary, different protocols were created over the years aiming to address speciﬁc sce-
narios. Currently, several WSN standards are available. Some of them are general-purpose
standards that are being applied in industrial applications. Others have been speciﬁ-
cally designed for industrial applications by adapting standards such as IEEE 802.15.1 [9]
and, predominantly, IEEE 802.15.4 [10]. In fact, these standards have become the basis
of many wireless technologies used at industrial factories for process automation. Thus,
IEEE 802.15.4 is the foundational stone for some standards such as ZigBee, WirelessHART,
ISA100.11a, or WIA-PA, whereas IEEE 802.15.1 is the base technology of WISA and WSAN-
FA. All these technologies can coexist in the spectrum space but cannot be easily intercon-
nected, so the problem of heterogeneity still persists. Moreover, most of these technologies,
e.g., conventional WiFi, operate at the industrial, scientiﬁc, and medical (ISM) radio bands,
in particular at the 2.4 GHz band, which may become saturated. Thus, interferences among
different technologies are difﬁcult to avoid.
This perspective article aims to present an overview of the most relevant technologies
currently found in industrial WSN systems. It recaps the major characteristic of each
technology, discusses their application domains, and shows some implementation examples.
Thus, the authors intend to clarify the potential use of WSN technologies in industrial
scenarios and guide application designers to select the most appropriate technology in each
case. The layout of this brief perspective article is as follows: Section 2 presents a short

overview of different IWSN technologies, including some implementation examples and
domains. Finally, Section 3 draws some conclusions.
2. State of the Art
Industrial applications can be divided into six different classes depending on their
requirements. Table 1 shows the classiﬁcation proposed by the ISA100 committee [11].
These classes range from critical safety and control applications, which must satisfy very
strict requirements in terms of latency, reliability, timing, and jitter, to monitoring applica-
tions, in which failures have a limited impact. Table 1 also includes the typical accepted
values for latency and packet loss probability [12], as well as some application examples.
The most critical class involves safety applications, with strict requirements in terms of
determinism, reliability, and data integrity. In these applications, latencies may reach values
of up to 10 ms. Closed-loop regulatory control applications also have strong requirements,
and the accepted latency values depend on the controlled process dynamics. Classes 2
to 5 have more relaxed requirements, due to their non-critical nature. Currently, wireless
technologies are frequently accepted in non-critical operations, which typically involve
monitoring, alerting, supervisory control, and data-logging tasks. In those applications, fail-
ures do not produce severe consequences or economic losses. Thus, the most problematic
applications for wireless technologies involve feedback control and safety operations [4].
Wireless technologies are starting to be accepted in some closed-loop operations, notably
in slow dynamics plants, in which the QoS provided by the WSN is able to ensure the
required rate. Some application examples may be found in chemical, pulp and paper, or
oil and gas industries [13]. These domains are especially suitable for wireless technologies
due to the large areas covered, and the difﬁculties, costs, and safety problems that wiring
may introduce.

2.1. WiFi
WiFi, the IEEE 802.11 standard, has come a long way since it was originally deﬁned in
1997. There have been several reviews improving its behavior. IEEE 802.11b was the ﬁrst
version massively adopted, after polishing the details of previous versions. Since then, WiFi
has become a very common wireless technology in general-purpose systems. However,
some characteristics of the standard, mainly the non-determinism caused by the MAC
policies, make it not suitable for some industrial applications. Often, WiFi has been used as
Energies 2023, 16, 1349
4 of 13
a gateway between wired or wireless LANs, and the Internet in industrial automation [14].
Initially, WiFi was deployed over the 2.4 GHz ISM band. More recently, the 5 GHz band
has been included. This approach may reduce interference problems between WiFi and
other technologies that employ the overpopulated 2.4 GHz band. One of the disadvantages
of WiFi, when compared to other wireless technologies, is power consumption. As a result,
WiFi devices provide a shorter battery life than other technologies.
The IEEE 802.11ax standard, commercially known as WiFi6, increments the scala-
bility of the nodes connected to one access point. The use of some technologies, e.g.,
orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA), multiple-user multiple-input
multiple-output (MU-MIMO), or spatial frequency reuse, may help to deploy a high density
of nodes avoiding collisions. WiFi6 claims a latency of 10 ms, which may be adequate for
some industrial applications. WiFi6 may reach a data rate of up to 9.6 Gbps. This data rate
can only be compared with the latest technologies, such as 5G networks.
WiFi HaLow, or WiFi 802.11ah, follows a different approach. This technology seeks
to adapt WiFi to the requirements of IoT systems. The coverage range is increased to
around 1 km [15], the power for transmission is reduced, making it more suitable for
battery-powered devices, and it is less affected by physical obstacles [16]. This is because it
uses sub-GHz frequencies. However, WiFi HaLow presents some drawbacks: the data rate
is lower than conventional WiFi, and it is not able to solve the problems of determinism
and latency of WiFi.
Since WiFi is widely spread, there have been interesting initiatives to develop WSN
systems with real-time requirements. For example, Banz et al. (2020) [17] presented some
amendments in the data link layer to allow control applications that require a data sample
of up to 1 kHz. The authors tested their approach with a balancing robot as hardware
in the loop. In [18], a similar approach was used. In this case, a sampling rate of 1 kHz
was required by using advanced control techniques over a real Segway-type balancing
robot. In the near future, the introduction of new technologies, such as WiFi6, may become
a real alternative for time-critical control applications in industries. There are several
monitoring and supervision use cases in the literature. For example, in [19], a scalable
IoT architecture was presented based on the edge–fog–cloud paradigm for monitoring the
Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) combining the use of MQTT over WiFi. The authors
of [20] implemented a WiFi HaLow network-based information system for scenario-speciﬁc
multi-sided applications for the coordination, documentation, and surveillance of rescue
forces in mass casualty incidents.
2.2. ZigBee
ZigBee is a technology based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, which is used for low-
energy communications with a low transmission rate [21]. It was developed in 2004 by
the ZigBee Alliance, now inside the Connectivity Standards Alliance (CSA). IEEE 802.15.4
deﬁnes the physical and MAC layers, whereas the network and application layers are
deﬁned by the Alliance. It supports star, tree, and mesh topologies. The mesh topology
tends to be the most used since the availability of redundant paths improves reliability. The
star topology, on the other hand, reduces the latency and is the most adequate for achieving
tight industrial requirements. ZigBee is conformed by three types of devices:
•
One coordinator per network that initializes, maintains, and manages the network;
•
Routers, which can ﬁnd paths for the messages from one node to another;
•
End devices, which are normally battery-powered. They collect and transmit data
from sensors and may sleep and wake up to extend their battery life.
ZigBee implements self-healing mechanisms in case of lost or changed status of node
links. However, it does not implement any system to replace the coordinator in case of
failure, with this node thus becoming a single-point failure [22]. In theory, ZigBee supports
up to 65,000 nodes per network, but frequently, this number is more limited. The maximum
distance between devices can reach 50 m. However, larger distances may be covered by
hopping between the nodes.
Energies 2023, 16, 1349

ZigBee has become a widely used technology in several domains, such as home
automation. The major reason behind its popularity is its low cost. In fact, it is an open
standard protocol without licensing fees for manufacturers. However, ZigBee is less
capable of meeting the industrial requirements of deterministic latency and reliability. That
makes ZigBee adequate for less critical tasks, such as monitoring and data acquisition,
and, therefore, less suitable for security tasks. An important characteristic of ZigBee is that
supports 868 MHz and 915 MHz radio bands, in addition to the 2.4 GHz band; therefore, it
can help to avoid using the saturated 2.4 GHz band. This characteristic is important since
ZigBee is a low-energy technology, and consequently, it is more inﬂuenced by networks
such as WiFi.
Common applications of ZigBee networks involve monitoring and data acquisition
tasks. For example, in [23], the authors used a ZigBee network to monitor an industrial
motor and predict maintenance needs using fuzzy logic. In [24], artiﬁcial intelligence was
combined with a ZigBee network to reduce costs and energy consumption in a warehouse.
There are efforts to implement control tasks using ZigBee networks, but they need to ﬁnd a
solution in case of Qby oS degradation. This question has been tackled in different ways.
For example, in [25], a two-level control scheme was presented. The highest level executes
sophisticated algorithms, and in case of QoS degradation, the control tasks are shifted
to edge devices with lower computing resources. This approach, tested over a robotic
arm, avoids the system from becoming uncontrolled. This article proposes the use of the
900 MHz radio band to avoid collisions between the ZigBee and 2.4 GH WiFi technologies.
In [26], authors proposed a redundant wireless network based on ZigBee and WiFi to make
the ship course-keeping control with a robust PID. Their approach adds compensation
control of time delay and packet loss. Other attempts try to achieve higher determinism.
For example, in [27], time-division multiple access (TDMA) policies were implemented
according to a static schedule. They were applied in a high-precision, micro-positioning
application with a piezoelectric actuator (PEA).
An alternative to ZigBee is Z-Wave. This technology is similar to ZigBee. However,
Z-Wave is a proprietary technology, provided by Silicon Labs. Although ZigBee is more
common in industrial applications, the main advantages of Z-Wave result from its pro-
prietary nature. The compatibility between devices is guaranteed. Z-Wave also provides
better security mechanisms [28]. An example of Z-Wave use can be observed in [29], where
a Z-Wave network is implemented to achieve real-time control in a smart home.
2.3. WirelessHART
WirelessHART is also based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. However, WirelessHART
is used for building reliable and secure wireless network systems in industrial appli-
cations [10,30]. It was introduced by HART Communication Foundation in 2007. The
physical OSI layer is based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, but WirelessHART speciﬁes
the data, network, transport, and application layers. Transport and application layers are
compatible between WirelessHART and the rest of the HART protocols. All devices are
time-synchronized and communicate in pre-scheduled, ﬁxed time slots. This is achieved
because this technology implements a TDMA network. The use of TDMA reduces colli-
sions and saves power consumption in the devices. WirelessHART operates in the ISM
2.4 GHz band. It implements some mechanisms to coexist in this band, such as Frequency
Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS) which changes between channels avoiding interferences.
WirelessHART allows for the use of star and mesh topologies, but star topology is not rec-
ommended. One of the main advantages of WirelessHART is its low energy consumption.
Battery-operated devices can reach a battery life of up to 10 years with sampling periods
between 4 and 8 s [31]. All devices have routing capabilities. There are six types of devices
in WirelessHART:
•
Field devices are connected to the sensors and actuators of the processes;
Energies 2023, 16, 1349
6 of 13
•
Router devices are not directly connected to the process. They only have communica-
tion functionalities and are especially useful when the networks need to be improved
or extended;
•
Adapter devices connect wired HART devices to wireless networks;
•
Handheld devices are used for installation, diagnosis, and maintenance operations;
•
Gateway devices connect the networks to the plant automation host. They translate
among different protocols;
•
The network manager is responsible for managing the wireless network. This includes
the following tasks: scheduling, network path conﬁguration, and reconﬁgurations.
Only one node per network can be active as a network manager, but this technology
allows a backup manager to take over in case of failures.
WirelessHART also introduces several layers of protection. All trafﬁc is secured, and
the payload is encrypted. All devices need a secret join key and a network ID in order to
join the network.
Previous characteristics make WirelessHART able to perform critical control tasks in slow
dynamic processes. For example, in [32], a co-designed dynamic PIDPlus controller over
the WirelessHART network was presented for the closed-loop control of slow-temperature
processes. This work achieved the major requirements for industrial wireless control. In [33],
WirelessHART was used to implement temperature control and device diagnostics.
2.4. ISA 100.11a
The International Society for Automation (ISA) proposed the ISA 100.11a standard in
2007. This standard introduces a wireless low-bit rate, low-power technology designed for
different tasks such as non-critical monitoring, alerting, supervisory control, and open- and
closed-loop control applications [11]. The ISA 100.11a standard addresses the performance
needs of those applications for latencies on the order of 100 ms. It uses the IEEE 802.15.4
physical layer over the 2.4 GHz band and has a low data link layer. The MAC access
is provided by means of TDMA, although it can also be implemented with CSMA-CA.
For avoiding collisions in the 2.4 GHz band, it implements diverse mechanisms [34]. (1)
Clear channel assessment (CCA): The device that initiates transmission checks whether
the channel is busy and cancels the transmission when it is found busy; (2) spectrum
management functionality: This mechanism limits the number of used channels to a subset
of the available ones; (3) adaptive channel hopping: Devices autonomously avoid channels
with a poor history of connectivity. The ISA 100.11a standard allows for the use of star and
mesh topologies. There are different types of devices in the ISA 100.11a standard:
•
Routing end devices are the I/O devices, connected to the sensors and actuators, with
routing capabilities;
•
Non-routing end devices are also I/O devices, but they lack routing capabilities;
•
Backbone routers are responsible for routing data packets from one subnet over the
backbone network to its destination, which can be another subnet or the gateway;
•
Handheld devices are used for installation, diagnosis, and maintenance operations;
•
System manager, which is the administrator of the network responsible for the con-
ﬁguration of the communication (e.g., resource allocation and scheduling), device
management, and run-time control of the network;
•
Gateway, which acts as an interface between the ﬁeld network and the plant network
(and control host applications);
•
Security manager, which is responsible for managing the security policy of the applications.
The ISA 100.11a standard is designed for non-critical tasks. In fact, it can be introduced
in control loops that involve slow dynamic processes. For example, in [35], the authors
used the ISA 100.11a standard to control a tank level with a wireless control loop and a PID.
The authors evaluated the performance of the standard, which can also provide wireless
communications in harsh environments due to its robustness. In [36], a slightly modi-
ﬁed version of the ISA 100.11a standard was used for communication tasks in a satellite,
considerably reducing the wiring weight, which is a key limiting factor in satellite designs.

2.5. WIA
Wireless network for industry automation (WIA) includes three different standards [37]:
The ﬁrst of them is WIA-PA for process automation, the second is called WIA-FA factory
automation, and lastly, WIA-NR, which stands for new radio. Every standard combines dif-
ferent technologies. WIA-PA implements the IEEE802.15.4 physical layer over the 2.4 GHz
band. The data link, network, and application layers are speciﬁcally deﬁned by the WIA
standard. WIA-FA adopts the IEEE 802.11 physical layer, whereas the data link and ap-
plication layers are deﬁned by the WIA standard. WIA-NR uses the physical layer and
medium-access control sublayer of 5G and deﬁnes the application layer. Every standard
adopts different topologies: WIA-PA supports star or hierarchical star–mesh topologies;
WIA-FA implements a redundant star topology; and WIA-NR uses a hierarchical star
topology that supports device-to-device (D2D) and coordinated multi-point (CoMP) com-
munication. WIA introduces different methods to avoid collisions, such as multi-channel
access, adaptive frequency hopping, and time synchronization schemes. In the application
layer, WIA facilitates interconnection with other industrial communication technologies.
The standard deﬁnes different types of devices:
•
Field devices are connected to the ﬁeld I/O devices, such as sensors and actuators;
•
Routing devices, access devices, and base stations (PA, FA, and NR, respectively),
which are responsible for connecting ﬁeld devices with gateways;
•
Gateways provide a connection between the hosts and WIA networks. A redundant
backup gateway can be added to increase the system’s robustness;
•
Handheld devices enable connection with the routing devices for installation, diagno-
sis, and maintenance operations.
Several works analyze the application of diverse WIA variants in process and factory
automation tasks. An example of its implementation for factory automation is shown
in [38], where a 1000-node plant was simulated, proving that WIA-FA is able to meet
strict requirements in terms of reliability and timeliness in a large plant. In [39], the
authors implemented a WIA-PA network for monitoring different processes. The WIA-NR
technology proved to be able to meet high industrial requirements, with low latencies and
reliability, as shown in [40].
2.6. LPWAN
Low-power, wide-area networks (LPWANs) are wireless networks that are used for
long-range communications. They can be used to create networks that cover large areas,
enabling IoT networks in large scales such as cities, rural environments, or agricultural
ﬁelds. Due to the nature of the environments and devices, battery-powered devices are
often used. The use of low-power communications increases the autonomy of the batteries,
reaching years of battery life, since low-power, low-bit rates reduce consumption. This
limitation makes them unsuitable for sending large volumes of data, but they are adequate
for transmitting small volumes, such as the magnitudes captured with sensors or commands
sent to actuators. Therefore, the main objectives of LPWANs are to achieve (1) long-range,
(2) low-power, and (3) low-cost communications. Within the LPWAN communications,
several speciﬁcations may be found. Below the most relevant ones are introduced, with
special emphasis on LoRa, which is shown as an example of these technologies.
LoRa is a type of LPWAN communication technology aimed to provide connectivity
of battery-operated devices over a long-range, wide area [41]. In fact, LoRa stands for long
range. Its physical layer is based on a proprietary spread spectrum modulation algorithm.
LoRa uses different frequency bands depending on the region; for example, in Europe,
LoRa is deployed over the 863-873 MHz band. The range that this technology covers
varies depending on the terrain obstacles. For example, it typically reaches a 5 km range
in urban environments, but in more open environments, LoRa can achieve a range of
more than 15 km. LoRa transmissions have very low power consumption, making this
technology adequate for battery-powered devices. LoRa only deﬁnes the physical layer,
whereas the data link and network layers are covered by LoRaWAN (long-range, wide-area
Energies 2023, 16, 1349
8 of 13
network) [42]. LoRaWAN was deﬁned by the LoRa Alliance in 2015. It is a low-transmission
rate technology able to achieve data rates between 0.3 kbit/s and 27 kbit/s. Three types of
devices are deﬁned:
•
Class A devices are most of the time idle. Typically, these devices wake up when an
event occurs, such as when a timer expires or a monitoring variable passes a threshold.
Then, class A devices initiate the transmission and listen for a response. If nothing is
received, devices go back to the idle status for a brief time interval and listen a second
time for a response. If during this time, the devices do not receive any message, they
go back to sleep until the next event occurs. There is no way to wake up externally an
end device. These devices are only suitable for connecting sensors but not actuators.
All LoRa devices must support the class A mode of operation.
•
Class B devices look for transmission windows in ﬁxed, synchronized, and regularly
scheduled time intervals. They can also transmit deﬁned events since they implement
class A behavior. These devices are suitable for carrying out periodic operations with
both sensors and actuators.
•
Class C devices are always listening to messages unless they are sending data. For
that reason, they have lower latency than all the LoRa class devices. Class C devices
implement two receive windows as class A devices, but they never close the second
window until the next transmission is sent. Therefore, they can receive a message at
almost any moment. They are suitable for connecting sensors and actuators. As Class
C devices must be operative all the time, they do not typically operate with batteries,
but they must be connected to power all the time.
LoRa networks consist of different devices, all of them providing unique identiﬁers.
End devices are typically used to connect sensors or actuators. Gateways are used to
bridge between LoRa networks and higher bandwidth networks such as WiFi, Ethernet of
3G/4G/5G, or other IP-supported technologies. Multiple gateways can be connected in the
same network, reducing the error rate. Finally, network servers manage the entire network,
including the application and join servers. The joint servers allow the secure joining of
the devices, as well as handling, managing, and interpreting the application data captured
from the sensors. LoRa introduces several spreading factors to avoid collisions so that they
appear as noise to one another. If packets have the same spreading factor, collisions can
occur, but if one of the signals is 6 db stronger than the other, the stronger signal will prevail.
The adaptive data rate (ADR) is essential to successfully implement LoRaWAN networks.
The closest nodes to the gateway use a lower spread factor to reduce the transmission time.
LoRa is suitable for long-range, low-energy communications, though the transmission
speed is low. These characteristics make LoRa difﬁcult to use in closed-loop control
applications. Use cases tend to address automation for devices distributed in wide areas.
For example, Sánchez Sutil (2020) [43] developed a smart public lighting control, while
Usmonov (2017) [44], the authors implemented a LoRa-based wireless control for a drip
irrigation system, and in [45], an IoT multi-sensory platform was presented for agriculture
monitoring and pump control. Due to the low cost and range capabilities of LoRa, there
are attempts to modify it to make LoRa closer to industrial requirements. As an example,
Fahmida (2022) [46] developed a real-time scheduling framework (RTPL) for LoRa to
enable industrial automation. Their results showed that RTPL achieved, on average, a 75%
improvement in real-time performance.
There are other LPWAN speciﬁcations. The most important ones, along with LoRa,
are Sigfox, NB-IoT, and LTE-M. Sigfox is developed by a French network global operator
company of the same name. It uses the 868 MHz band in Europe and the 902 MHz band in
the US. The use of ultra-narrowband allows low-energy communication that may cover
large areas, with a maximum range of 30–50 km in rural areas. Its main characteristics are
the use of differential binary phase-shift keying (DBPSK) and Gaussian frequency-shift
keying (GFSK) and a one-hop star topology [47]. Sigfox operates with a closed IoT solution,
but the chipset speciﬁcation is open to manufacturers. NB-IoT is a proprietary technology
developed by 3GPP. NB-IoT focuses on indoor coverage. It uses a subset of the LTE standard
Energies 2023, 16, 1349
9 of 13
but limits the bandwidth to a 200 kHz band [48]. Finally, LTE-M, also developed by 3GPP,
relies on LTE machine-to-machine communications. The advantages of LTE-M over NB-IoT
include its higher data rate, up to 1 Mbps [49], and better mobility, although it requires
more bandwidth and is more costly. Both NB-IoT and LTE-M are still under development
and are scheduled to be upgraded to be capable of achieving URLCC capabilities with
the release-14 version [50]. Therefore, these technologies have the potential to be used in
wireless networking if these objectives are fulﬁlled.
2.7. BLE
BLE was deﬁned in 2010 as part of the Bluetooth 4.0 speciﬁcation. BLE is a short-range,
low-energy communication technology. Even though Bluetooth was initially conceived
as a star topology, BLE stacks can be modiﬁed to support mesh topologies. Thus, the
layers above the network layer must be changed to support BLE mesh [51,52]. The BLE
physical layer has 40 channels on the ISM 2.4 GHz band. Three of them (channels 37–39)
are used as advertising channels (ACs) for device discovery, connection establishment,
and broadcasting. The remaining 37 channels (0–36) are data channels (DCs), providing
two-way data transfer. BLE implements the adaptive frequency hopping (AFH) technique
between DC to minimize the effect of the interferences. The data link layer deﬁnes different
roles for BLE devices. Speciﬁcally, there are three kinds of devices: masters, slaves, and
advertisers. First, a device broadcasts its presence. When a connection is established with a
central device, the central node acts as master and the peripheral device as slave. Devices
can support different roles to create complex topologies. There have been several efforts to
standardize BLE mesh, the most important of which are Bluetooth SIG: Bluetooth Smart
Mesh and IETF: IPv6 over BLE mesh networks. However, the BLE mesh technology is not
considered mature yet.
Some efforts sought to implement real-time capabilities in BLE mesh networks. For
example, in [53], multi-hop real-time wireless communications were achieved using the
MRT-BLE protocol. Nevertheless, this approach only allows the deﬁnition of the topology
ofﬂine, so there cannot be mobile nodes in the network, which is a clear limitation. Some
implementation examples outside real-time domains can be found. For example, in [54], the
authors used a BLE network to implement a position algorithm along with WiFi to make
more accurate position identiﬁcation and tracking. Another example can be found in [55],
where a BLE mesh was used to make a smart lighting control, extending the coverage area
and increasing its ﬂexibility.
2.8. 5G
Cellular networks have come a long way since 1G was launched in the early 1980s [56].
These technologies have evolved over the years, augmenting data transmission rates and
security and reducing their cost. The introduction of 4G, in the 2010s, was an important
achievement since it considerably enhanced the data rate. At the beginning of Industry
4.0, despite its high cost, 4G became an important IoT technology for devices with high
mobility. For example, in logistics, the capabilities of 4G facilitate digitization in the industry.
More recently, in 2019, the ﬁrst commercial 5G networks were deployed. This technology
promises to revolutionize the wireless communication paradigm, achieving more strict QoS
requirements than actual wireless technologies. Notably, 5G uses a millimetric wavelength
spectrum [57]. As a result, the range is more limited. For that reason, the deployment of 5G
networks is based on a large number of small cellular stations, in contrast to the traditional
large cellular towers, which can slow down its deployment outside urban areas.
Currently, 5G is not a cost-effective technology for industrial applications. However, its
price is expected to considerably reduce in the near future, thus opening new opportunities.
Some experimental 5G technologies may reach 10 Gb/s transfer speeds. It also provides
high scalability and massive machine-type communication (mMTC) since it may admit up
to 100 nodes/m2. One of the key characteristics of 5G is that it provides ultra-reliable, low-
latency communication (uRLLC). In fact, it is expected to have a latency value below 1 ms
Energies 2023, 16, 1349
10 of 13
and a reliability rate of over 99.999%. If these ﬁgures are achieved, the requirements of many
industrial applications would be satisﬁed. Indeed, it could become an alternative in devices
with high mobility, such as autonomous guided vehicles (AGVs), robots, or logistics.
Private 5G networks are particularly interesting in industrial applications [58]. Private
networks may provide dedicated coverage, which is key to having robust indoor networks
even in remote areas. Furthermore, there is no contention for network resources as in public
networks, adding reliability and robustness to the network. Intrinsic control of the network
can be achieved. This allows the implementation of trafﬁc priorities or security policies
to ensure data. Private networks can be customized to meet the speciﬁc requirements of
diverse applications. All these characteristics make private 5G networks reliable and de-
pendable. It is believed that 5G is going to be implemented in many industrial applications
since 5G characteristics make it adequate to be used in IoT and IIoT applications. Many
domains can beneﬁt from the massive introduction of 5G technologies, such as industrial
automation (smart factories), automotive industry and smart cars, warehouse operations,
utilities, industrial remote operation, intelligent transportation (logistics), mining operation,
railway networks, healthcare, or smart grids and smart cities. Notably, 5G can be key
in the achievement of tactile internet [59], becoming the communication technology for
haptic systems. Applications in augmented reality, healthcare monitoring and intervention,
navigation, and transportation are expected to be developed with this technology in the
not-too-far future.
Previously, 5G had to overcome some obstacles: Technological maturity, global stan-
dardization, government regulations, and cost are the major concerns for massive 5G
adoption. Companies are especially reluctant to change. Signiﬁcant barriers were iden-
tiﬁed such as data security and privacy, lack of standards, and challenges of end-to-end
implementation [60]. The upgrade or replacement of networks to adopt 5G may involve
design problems, training, and, inevitably higher costs [61].
Other technologies are also available for WSN, such us RPMA, eMTC, EC-GSM IoT,
Weightless, DASH7, Wi-Sun, and Matter-or-Thread protocol. However, at the moment,
they are less common in Industry 4.0 applications.
3. Conclusions
Connectivity is a key issue in Industry 4.0 applications since it allows the introduction
of new key concepts. Today, wired technologies prevail in industrial scenarios, and they
will clearly remain in use in the future, especially in critical applications. However, the
use of wireless networks achieves several beneﬁts when compared to wired technologies:
They introduce higher ﬂexibility to modify the layout of the links; enhance the connectivity
between taking nodes, sensors, and actuators; and eliminate wires, reducing the deploy-
ment cost. In fact, they introduce new possibilities into Industry 4.0 applications since they
facilitate connection with mobile devices or parts.
Wireless communication technologies had already found a place in factories for non-
critical operations, such as data acquisition, monitoring, and supervision. Failures in these
tasks do not have severe consequences, which may involve the security of people and assets.
However, the use of these technologies in critical applications, for example, in closed-loop
control operations, is not mature yet. Some application examples may be found, especially
in slow dynamic processes such as those found in the oil, gas, and chemical industries.
However, this topic is still under research in academia.
Currently, several protocols are available. Each technology may be valid for different
scenarios. The development of the newest technologies, such as WiFi6 and 5G, could allow
WSN to compete in performance with traditional wired communications. If they are capable
of delivering such promising specs, the introduction of wireless technologies in factories
may be disruptive. The ﬂexibility and scalability that offer wireless communications can
make the factory evolve into more smart factories, ﬂexible enough to adapt quickly to the
needs and circumstances of different products and productive environments. Nevertheless,
there are obstacles to overcome. Factories are a really harsh environment for wireless
Energies 2023, 16, 1349
11 of 13
technologies, due to several phenomena such as interferences, shadowing, or fading.
Moreover, the cost of the deployment of these technologies is still high. In the short term, it
is expected that both wired and wireless technologies coexist in factories. In the long run, it
seems clear to the authors that wireless solutions are going to be massively deployed in
the industry.
This perspective article covered the most relevant technologies for use in industry. We
sought to provide an overview of these technologies and some cases of use to illustrate
their application in different domains. Thus, this study helps researchers and application
designers to select the most appropriate technology in each case.

Abstract – Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) have seen a dramatic increase in research and real-world application in recent 
years. Many parts of our everyday lives have been affected, including electrical power systems, oil and gas delivery, 
transportation networks, medical equipment, home appliances, and a host of other areas. For example, many critical 
infrastructure and life support equipment are relying on these kinds of systems. As a result, they are required to be 
completely secure and resistant to all forms of assaults, which is almost unachievable for any real-world system. This 
paper focuses on security analysis in CPSs, whereby security in CPSs, security threats in CPSs, and security challenges in 
CPSs, have been discussed

INTRODUCTION 
Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) [1] are a new study topic that has the potential to bring together the physical and digital 
worlds. In order to integrate the physical and digital worlds, these systems use integrated components to perform tasks 
collectively. CPSs have grown more dispersed as a result of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the increased complexity of 
jobs, thus it is vital to design ubiquitous CPSs capable of providing timely service delivery. A distributed CPS with 
multiresolution dynamism and connectivity allows for the efficient, reliable, safe and secure administration of monitoring 
and management of physical objects in the real world. Innovations such as Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), 
interactive platforms, and cloud technology have emerged in the construction of CPSs after the merger of CPSs and IoT. 
The potential of service-oriented CPSs has been highlighted by the need of devices in CPSs to work together on both a 
cyber and a physical scale. While the service-oriented methodology may be used to create dispersed real-time CPSs that 
can interact with real-world objects in real-time, it is not adequate to fully realise complete distributed CPSs that take into 
consideration the interrelations between virtual and real elements. A distributed embedded computing framework depends 
on agents that are aware of their context is therefore more appealing because it is possible to incorporate various attributes 
into agents and achieve distributed cloud computing with improved coordination and interconnectivity between 
independent and inhomogeneous agents. When it comes to CPSs, context-awareness is a must, since this new technology 
relies heavily on sensors, resources, adaptability, and augmentation. Partial observability in CPSs is a given, given the 
dynamic nature of distributed CPSs domains. As a result, in order to get high model performance while using ontology as 
the underlying semantic technology, it is necessary to use uncertainty modelling methodologies. 
There are substantial challenges to the security and privacy protection of CPS because of the complexity of CPS and its 
heterogeneity. Cyber-physical interactions have made assessing threats and vulnerabilities more challenging, and new 
security concerns have arisen. Because the assaults may come from various CPS components, tracing and examining them 
is particularly complex. The construction of defensive systems requires an in-depth study of the vulnerabilities, threats, and 
assaults. Identifying gaps, weak linkages, and new avenues for investigation will be made possible by a review of current 
CPS privacy and security measures. This paper focuses on security analysis in CPSs, whereby security in CPSs, security 
threats in CPSs, and security challenges in CPSs, have been discussed. The remaining part of the paper has been organized 
as follows. Section II focusses on the background analysis of the paper. Section III focuses on a critical survey of the 
security of CPSs. Section IV finally draws conclusions to the paper and presents suggestions for future studies.

BACKGROUND ANALYSIS  
CPSs (Cyber Physical Systems) are IT structures integrated into real-world applications. There are sensors and actuators 
included in these systems. Advances in information and communications technology (ICTs) have resulted in a rise in the 
interconnection between physical processes. 
 
Real-life Application of CPSs 
It is the current iteration of instrumentation and control systems that can constantly monitor the physical environment. 
CPSs are becoming more important in a wide range of industries, including energy, aviation, and healthcare. As a very 
significant and symbolic consideration, it is contingent on the technology used. An example of a CPS is the SCADA, 
which is employed in CI, e.g., smart/intelligent grids and industrial control systems, and wearable and implanted gadgets 
(utilized in medical care). There are so many versions of CPSs that it would be impossible to mention them all here, but in 
this article, we'll focus on four examples (see Table 1) of how CPSs might be used. 
 
Table 1. Examples of CPSs applications 
Application 
Details  
Industrial Control 
Systems (ICS) 
Nuclear power facilities, water and sewage treatment plants, and irrigation systems all use ICS 
(SCADA or distribution systems) to better their control and output. We use a variety of 
controllers in ICS, including PLCs (Programmable Logic Controller) [2]. You may use this 
gadget to accomplish a variety of goals by combining its many features. A variety of actuators 
and sensors are being employed to link this gadget to the real-world. This system has both 
wireless and cable communication capabilities that may be employed depending on the 
environment. Using PC systems, it is also possible to monitor and control systems in a control 
centre. 
Smart Grid Systems 
Smart grids are the next generation of grids for producing energy, even though they have been 
in use for decades. By giving consumers more control over their energy use at the local scale, it 
is both economically and ecologically viable. In addition, it improves pollution management, 
global load balance, and saves energy at the national scale. 
Clinical Devices 
In an aim to render between medical care, clinical gadgets have been enhanced with a 
combination of cyber and physical capabilities. In order to help patients, these medical gadgets 
may either be implanted in the body or worn as wearable devices. These gadgets are 
intelligent, and they can connect with other gadgets using wireless technology. A programmer 
is responsible for establishing this line of communication, which is necessary for performing 
software updates and configuration changes on the devices. Patients who use a wearable 
gadget are more likely to keep track of their daily routines. 
Smart Vehicles 
Sustainable, fuel-efficient, cleaner and more convenient: these are the characteristics that 
distinguish smart cars from traditional automobiles. Electronic Control Units (ECUs), a system 
of up to 70 computer networks, allowed these improvements. ECUs are responsible for 
overseeing and controlling a variety of functions, including machine emission controls, 
recreation controls (audiovisual and radio players), braking control, and recreational elements 
(cruise control, and closing and window opening). To help alleviate traffic congestion and 
prevent accidents on the road and in the area, these kinds of advancements are critical in the 
present era's technological landscape. 
 
Developments in Clinical CPSs 
We have analysed the wearable technology and IMDs, and now it's time to talk about the relevance of CPSs in clinical 
uses, such as insulin pumps, ventilation systems, and patient surveillance systems that are software-intensive. Many 
individuals are interested in these medical gadgets because they promise to make their lives more comfortable and stress-
free (via determining causal factors of diseases or treating diseases). Because of this, new difficulties and possibilities for 
the scientific community arise when big changes are made to these devices. The following (see Table 2) are some of the 
most common developments in medical instruments: 
Overdosing should not be possible with a properly set PCA device since it is meant to only deliver a certain number of 
doses, no matter how frequently the button is pushed. This safety system, on the other hand, is insufficient to meet the 
needs of all patients. Misprogrammed pumps, pump developers who overestimate a patient's maximal dosage, drugs placed 
incorrectly into the device, and PCA-by-proxy are just a few of the possible causes of overdoses that may lead to death or 
serious illness in many patients. It is not possible to address all of the clinical practise situations that PCA infusion pumps 
are implicated in, even with established precautions like medication libraries and programmable thresholds. Because of 
this, we'll need more effective medical gadgets to examine people in the near future (equipment are also required to

determine the patient's medication concentration). Medical gadgets are also increasingly being used to monitor a patient's 
heart rate, respiratory rate, sugar levels, perceived stress, and body temperature. Despite this, since they lack real-time 
diagnostic ability, these instruments are limited to a store-and-forward mode of operation and performance. Vital signs can 
be monitored in real time using closed-loop technologies in physiology, although this requires continual attention.

Details 
New software-enabled 
functionality 
Embedded system concepts [3] are used to bring new technology into medical equipment, 
such as robotic surgery and proton therapy treatment, using software-based design. Real-time 
processing of high-resolution pictures and haptic feedback is required for this (robotic 
surgery). In contrast, proton therapy treatment is one of the most digital therapies and 
requires one of the biggest clinical device systems in the world. Patients with cancer get 
precise treatment directions from a cyclotron using a proton beam that give exact dosages of 
radiation. Beam planning and projecting might potentially be disrupted by the fact that the 
same beam is disseminated to several patients and must be transferred from place to site. 
Research on the safety of proton beam machines has mostly focused on one type in the last 
decade, namely, devices that must be turned off in an emergency. One of the key issues 
confronting medical device makers and the industry is how to properly analyse and evaluate 
such massive and complicated structures. 
Enhanced connectivity of 
clinical gadgets 
Nowadays, health gadgets are connected with network connections since they increasingly 
depend on software. The usage of such interconnected healthcare devices allows the creation 
of more decentralized structures of clinical devices, which have to be planned properly and 
structured to perform particular functions. Electronic health records (EHRs) might be 
employed to save patient data via the localized or distant interconnection of these clinical 
devices for tracking patients or for tele-ICU telemonitoring in Electronic Health Records 
(EHR). As a consequence of these limitations, novel treatment approaches and enhanced 
patient safety may be achieved via the use of such healthcare devices in the present context. 
Medical Device Plug-and-and-Play (MD PnP) interoperability approach is a standard open 
framework for scalable and safe interconnections of clinical devices, and for enhancing 
patient safety and efficacy within the healthcare system. 
Physiologically closed-
loop systems 
In most clinical facilities, a nurse is assigned to keep an eye on the systems (or more than 
one). During an operation, an anaesthesiologist manages the patient's sedation and decides 
when to alter the sedative stream. This reliance on "person in the loop" may jeopardise 
patient safety, which is why some in the clinical community worry about it. Nurses who are 
often overburdened and under tremendous time constraints may overlook a critical warning 
sign. There may be times when nurses are unable to care for numerous patients 
simultaneously; however, they can operate a device, which will be a significant assistance to 
the nurse and enhance patient safety and care. Nonetheless, even though the machine 
(computer) can never replace the caregivers (in emotion), it may significantly reduce the 
caregiver's labour by bringing attention to the caregiver only when anything out of the 
normal occurs. The medical device industry has long employed case-based on closed-loop 
physiologic control. PCA (Patient-Controlled Analgesia) is a medical condition that takes use 
of the closed loop technique [4]. Pain treatment after surgery is usually achieved using PCA 
infusion pumps. PCA pumps allow patients to request a dosage at any time, rather than 
relying on a caregiver's set schedule for delivery. 
Continuous Monitoring 
and Care 
Residential care, supported living, telehealth, and medical monitoring of sports activities are 
becoming more popular as an alternative to in-hospital treatment because of their lower cost. 
Remote monitoring of patient and bodily functions is feasible via mobile surveillance and 
home automation. 
 
Cyber, Network and Data/Information Security  
Data security, of which cyber-security is a subset, encompasses a broader range of concerns. Many different methods, 
technologies or practises may be utilised to safeguard a firm’s networks and computers against unauthorized accessibility, 
damage or hazards. When it comes to protecting both real and virtual material, InfoSec ensures that no one can get their 
hands on it. In contrast to cyber-security, the objective of information security (InfoSec) is to safeguard data in any format. 
When it comes to cyber dangers like viruses, malware, and Trojan horses, network security is responsible for protecting the 
company's IT infrastructure from all types of cyberattacks including hacker and denial-of-service attacks, hosts and

spyware. Various elements of the network security framework work collaboratively to keep us safe. A firewall, Intrusion 
Detection/Prevention System (IDS/IPS), Virtual Private Network (VPN), and anti-virus, are all shared security measures 
on most systems. 
 
 
III. 
SECURITY ANALYSIS IN CYBER-PHYSICAL SYSTEMS (CPS) 
Security in CPSs 
In this section, we provide various instances to demonstrate the criticality of safety to the CPS process. Cryptography, 
access management, penetration testing, and a slew of other concepts fall under the umbrella of security control (used in IT 
models). When it concerns safeguarding an ICT's infrastructure, they play a critical role [5]. There will be a lot of demand 
for error-free cyber physical systems in the near future. There will be many more assaults like these in the future, therefore 
it's important to be prepared now. Uses of CPSs as shown in Table 3 need various levels of security. 
 
Table 3. Security breach of CPSs Applications 
CPSs Application 
Details 
Nuclear energy 
Based on the facts, it might be disastrous if the CPS lacks enough protection. In the case of a 
nuclear facility, for example, the safety of the CPS might be compromised, posing a global 
security risk. As recently as 2010, Iran's nuclear power reactors were targeted by an assault known 
as Stuxnet. Big industrial control systems also have a large number of outdated systems. In fact, 
this also holds true. Over the past decade, several individuals have worked on "lightweight 
cryptographic mechanisms" (mechanisms that make data safe, accessible, and secure). However, 
much work remains to be done in each of these areas. Make sure to take into account that some 
security level is preferable to none at all. An ICS's security is critical, and researchers must do 
their share to ensure it. 
Smart Grid 
Security 
If smart grid security is breached, users might lose particular services and the utility agencies 
might lose particular funds. It is also possible to target smart grids from a distance, which might 
result in widespread power outages. For example, malfunctioning medical devices, information 
loss at the data center, and also enhanced crime rate might occur if there are power or energy 
shortages. As a result, the security of Smart Grid CPSs is fundamental (also to safeguard user data 
within a system) 
Patient safety 
The safety of patients might be jeopardised if hacker-targeted wearables and IMDs are not 
adequately guarded. Licensing authorities must be able to gain access to and utilize datasets, they 
have to have the capabilities to recognize, modifying, updating and ensuring that gadgets are 
accessible to them. As a result, ensuring the safety of a medical app's users' and patients' personal 
information is of paramount importance. 
Automobile 
industry 
Automobile manufacturers are always looking for innovative ways to improve the usability and 
comfort of their vehicles for their consumers. Researchers aren't always thinking about safety 
when they create vehicles, but that's a good thing to keep in mind. Security safeguards the 
vehicle's capacity to continue operating in the event of a minor collision. In contrast, safety was 
not a segment of the design, but rather an added feature. For the vehicle’s novel element to work, 
they must be able to connect wirelessly and physically. For the most part, smart cars rely on these 
two technologies to protect them from most security breaches or attacks. We must find ways to 
defend ourselves that are both secure and effective. 
 
In order to adequately safeguard CPSs, the underlying technologies should accomplish particular performance 
necessities. This allows for the implementation of proven safety systems and standards. 
 
Security Parameters 
For CPSs, there are a number of variables to consider in order to ensure, which the system they protect are safe enough 
(actual-work application). In order to protect CPSs, we must adhere to strict security guidelines. 
In recent years, it has become more evident that the reliability of control functions is a critical component. The most 
significant distinction between control schemes and IT security is the absence of patching or updating requirements for 
control systems. The process of upgrading a computer may take months, for example. Stopping an industrial computer 
every time a new security patch is released is not worth the effort. After a software upgrade on March 7, 2008, a gadget 
designed to monitor chemical data and diagnostic datasets from the plant’s corporate systems began operations again. This 
resulted in the shutdown of a nuclear power facility by accident. There was no evidence that water reservoirs had 
decreased, which meant that nuclear fuel rods could not be kept cold. When the machine was rebooted, it generated this 
error. Autonomy is critical, but so is the requirement for decision-making that occurs in real time (another management

system component). Much attention has been paid to availability as a security concern. The real-time operational 
environment, on the other hand, is more stringent than that of most other IT systems. 
The last portion of the report discusses the various security factors and standards for CPSs (i.e., in intelligent control 
system, intelligent grid system, etc.). In the sub-section below, we will discuss the various forms of security threats in CPSs 
(i.e., intelligent grid system, intelligent clinical devices, intelligent control schemes, etc.). 
 
Security Threats in CPSs 
Our discussion of the security standards for four distinct CPS applications may be found in the preceding section. For each 
of these applications, we will now discuss some probable attacks. In this sub-section, we're going to discuss about various 
different cyber physical assaults. 
 
Real-world cyber physical threats 
CPSs systems could be attacked by Physical (P), Cyber-Physical (CP) and Cyber (C) threats, and how to prevent them [6]. 
There are just a few recorded public assaults, and it's quite difficult to get back or figure out exactly what occurred in the 
immediate aftermath. In this chapter, attacks are categorised according to the location of the injuries. The term "cyber" 
refers to assaults on computers that do not compromise sensors or actuators. The term "physical" refers to assaults that 
target specific physical components. When it comes to cyber-physical threats, on the contrary, they are threats that attack 
physical elements through the employment of cyber elements. But extortion control systems have been around for a long 
time, so this is nothing new. Terrorism and physical violence are being employed as a means of extortion in many nations. 
Because they are quicker, cheaper, and do not have to be constricted by distances, cyberattacks are a logical next stage in 
the development of physical assaults. The following are examples of cyber and physical assaults against CPS that may now 
be documented:

Industrial Control 
System Attacks 
Iran was hit by a "Stuxnet" assault in 2010 that damaged many nuclear reactors. Iran has recently 
been the target of many cyberattacks by cybercriminals from the United States. There have been 
two kinds of attacks discovered against ICS. 
1. Communication protocols: In several cases, attackers exploited holes in communication 
systems. A SCADA system [7], for instance, demonstrated how to evade the domain 
resolution protocol. 
2. Espionage: Hacking ICS hacks like DuQu and Flame may be exploited to spy on 
individuals. A number of ICS networks were detected in the Mideast in 2012 by Flame, 
for example The primary purpose of this spyware was to steal confidential information 
from businesses, such as their locations and the passwords they entered into their 
computers. 
In many nations, intruders who are not authorized are attacking them on a daily basis. At this 
point, governments are employing these assaults as a weaponry to inflict maximum harm on their 
adversary (the enemy). 
Smart Grid CPS 
Attack 
CPS assault on a Central Processing System (CPS). The most frequent occurrence is a total power 
outage. Smart grids are vulnerable to cyberattacks, which might result in a complete blackout in a 
nation. It was quite significant whenever it happened in USA and Europe a few times over the past 
10 years. 
Clinical CPS attack 
In a distributed framework, insider threats, spies and other types of threats are probable. This is a 
major danger. Medical gadgets may be tampered with or hacked by an insider, allowing him to 
control the machinery in any way he sees fit. The wireless transmissions that medical gadgets use 
to keep individuals healthier might easily be jammed by an invader. In this case, the gadget would 
be rendered useless and would not be able to render the necessary treatments. 
Intelligent Vehicles 
Attack 
Taking control of a motor vehicle or automobiles from a specific distance or through an assault 
from the outside is a major security issue. An assailant might take control of any car, which could 
result in a major traffic incident. 
 
Physical Threats on CPSs 
Physical assaults that were popular in the past include the following: i) A Pennsylvania (USA) water filtration facility was 
hacked by intruders in 2006 and employed as its own unlicensed application distribution system or spam, which was later

shut down. ii) Machines compromised with the Slammer worm at the Davis Besse power company in Ohio, took down 
security surveillance system in January 2003. iii) the Maroochy Shire Council in Queensland, Australia, was attacked in 
2000, on the sewage control system (that was undertaken by disgruntled ex-worker of the contractor company, which has 
established the control systems). In this part, we'll look at an example of a threat framework in CPS. 
 
Adversary Framework in CPS 
Identifying potential threats to a system's security requires an in-depth investigation. An adversary model can be used to 
assess the scope and severity of a problem. Cybercriminals have been breaking into computers all over the world for the 
better part of the last decade or so (even in control models). Control systems compromised with malware might not work as 
planned. From a safety perspective, these attacks are critical because they are the result of unauthorised access to control 
systems' computers and networks. Attacks by insiders can occur even when control networks are completely isolated from 
the public Internet and other networks. Currently, targeted computer attacks are primarily perpetrated by disgruntled 
employees. Most of the time, these employees don't collaborate with each other. " Larger, better-coordinated groups can do 
more damage, but these individuals may not. As a major issue in CPS, this one necessitates a solution that is both practical 
and realistic. 
Criminal groups and terrorists may try to access the security models. Presently, there are no proofs that terrorists and 
activists have used computer threats to access controllers. Although criminal clusters may be involved, there is some 
evidence. CPS initiatives aren't new, but they're gaining in popularity these days because of how much money they can 
make. Iran and Iraq, for example, have been subjected to physical attacks in the last few years as a result of this tactic. 
Cyberattacks on other nations' physical infrastructure will become more commonplace in the near future. Table 5 depicts 
the concept of attacks and consequences of attacks.  
 
Table 5. Concepts of Attacks and Consequences 
Concept 
Details  
Attacks  
Resonance assaults on control systems may be used by attackers to gain access (i.e., threats that are 
non-feasible in more conventional information technology schemes). Someone tampered with some of 
the sensors or controls, causing physical systems to oscillate at a natural frequency.  
Consequences of 
Attacks  
We're not aware of anybody who's done research on the potential consequences of assaults on critical 
infrastructures. A person may get entry to a control scheme that does not correspond to them via 
SCADA security reports, which may look like overreaction. The majority of controllers have 
safeguards in place to prevent catastrophic failures. 
 
Security challenges in cyber physical systems 
All of these terms, as well as others, are intertwined in this piece of writing (paper). We define challenges as unanswered 
problems, and our goal is to entice individuals to do more investigation to discover solutions. An internal (security) 
weakness that may be exploited by intruders is referred to as a "vulnerability." Things that potentially harm a system are 
known as threats. 
 
Overall  CPSs security Isues 
Security based on Design  
Since most CPS are not linked to other systems like the web, they are not meant to be secure. CPS are not linked to other 
networks, which implies that cybersecurity isn't taken into concern while designing them. Keeping people secure, then, was 
mostly a matter of physical security. 
 
 Cyber Physical Security 
Keeping people secure, then, was mostly a matter of physical security. Designers of CPSs must rethink security from a 
cyber and physical perspective if they are to succeed. Our ability to foresee and prevent new cyber-attacks which have 
physical implications should be improved. There is a need to develop infrastructure for resolution components (cyber-
physical technologies), which have hitherto been dismissed.  
 
Real-Timeliness Nature 
In case a certain criterion in real-time is not reached, it has a direct impact on the condition of defence. In order to survive 
an assault, networks rely on CPS to make timely judgments. CPS security that considers the interplay between real and 
virtual factors may be shown to the whole globe. Better risk evaluation and threat detection may be achieved by using this 
method. Since cryptographic techniques must be put on top of these approaches to facilitate real-time interoperability, 
which is what ought to occur.

Uncoordinated Changes 
The CPS employs a large number of employees. Those who manufacture, use, own, and operate goods are all included, as 
are those who work for them. They need to be well managed, even if their jobs and responsibilities are distinct. This shift 
will need the attention of many personnel and several CPS divisions (an issue that we must not ignore). Stakeholders in a 
CPS community should coordinate their efforts at some point. Upgrading hardware, upgrading or modifying software, and 
introducing new features are all examples of methods to improve things. A country's security may be jeopardised if 
unanticipated improvements to CPSs security (i.e., novel flaws) were to occur. 
Industrial Control System Issues 
Change Management 
Numerous Internet of Things (IoT) gadgets must be removed or modified in ICS environments. Replacement, 
modification, or deletion of these systems is required (at one place). ICS system updates, for example, must be scheduled 
meticulously in order to minimise issues. The ICS system's security plan may change without the awareness of many 
investors; therefore, we must organize change controls in order to monitor and prevent security-based changes within 
CPSs. 
Malicious Insider 
Due to the fact that the assault originates from inside the organisation, tracking down and stopping a hostile insider are very 
difficult tasks. Internal attacks like those in Maroochy’s sewage system and water supply, or Stuxnet, might be launched by 
an insider who has the trust and inside knowledge necessary to carry out the attack. This is only one illustration of what 
may be accomplished (via a USB stick). Insiders may unintentionally utilise virus-attacked computers or USB sticks, 
amounting in ICS entry points being made available to unauthorised users. Finding out who is an internal attacker has been 
the main difficulty that many independent researchers have neglected or ignored. 
Secure Integration 
To prevent new security issues, new components must be integrated into existing systems in a secure manner. It's important 
to keep in mind that the ICS depends heavily on out-of-date technology that might be susceptible. In order to make ICS as 
safe as possible, all of the old components must be removed and new, safer ones installed. So, short-term fixes are needed 
to avoid any difficulties with ICS. 
 
Smart grids challenges 
Table 6 presents the challenges in the smart grid. 
Table 6. Smart grid challenges 
Challenge 
Details 
Change 
Management  
Smart grid adjustments aren't any simpler to cope with than ICS updates, but they're also not much 
easier. Even while smart grids are increasingly complex and include a greater number of people, 
they are unable to adapt to changes. It necessitates the use of change management in order to keep 
smart grids healthy. 
Two-Way 
Communications 
The Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) [8] in an intelligent grid allows for two-way 
communication. Consumers' residences are less of a target for physical attacks since AMI smart 
metres can connect with utility providers that are nearby, unlike the power grid. Since the 
introduction of smart grids, keeping these gadgets secure has grown increasingly complex. 
Access 
Control 
Mechanisms  
With a vast reach and many investors, smart grids require strong access control systems to keep 
them safe. It is critical to keep watch on and regulate any potential accessibility to the smart grid 
system, data, or gadgets. Whenever possible, it is important to empower the individuals or 
organisations that are meant to assist. 
Privacy Concerns 
Anxieties about the usage of personal information are common. Increasing use of smart grids has 
made this an issue for many individuals. Moreover, it is essential to provide anonymization 
strategies to prevent attackers from deducing trends or encrypted information to disclose sensitive 
information. The term for this is "anonymization." As a result, we must ensure that the methods 
we design can encode and consolidate data securely. 
Explicit Trust 
We should just not put any faith in the perceived data or directives that have been transmitted in 
this circumstance. Instead, new methods must be devised to recognise bogus data and actions that 
are not permitted. Because smart grids are so big, it might be difficult to employ algorithms that 
just search for faults to identify FDI assaults. 
Comprehensive 
Security 
Smart grids benefit from having high levels of security. Even at the lowest levels, it's a problem 
(as a result of limited capacities in devices on the lower level). There might be variations in the 
number of securities, which has to be in place at every level as a consequence. Several academic 
researchers have to come up with compact technologies in order to achieve this. Encryption is also 
critical for maintaining the privacy and security of data at all layers of the smart grid. This is to 
ensure that there is no security breach at any time.

Medical devices challenges 
Table 7 presents the medical device challenges. 
Table 7.  Medical devices challenges  
Challenge 
Details 
Usability vs. 
Security 
When the patient's condition is serious, changing the unit would be impossible. Someone with 
IMD may find himself in a position where another medical professional need immediate 
assistance. So, if the providers will not have the cryptography credentials or access credentials, 
which permit them to transform IMD, thereby having IMD might be problematic. 
More Code vs. Add-
On Security  
It's critical to have security, but it shouldn't be prohibitively expensive to install. In order to make 
IMDs more secure, their code may grow in size, making them more susceptible to be seized. 
Because of this, it is imperative that the cryptographic processes affecting the functionality and 
cost of medical equipment (that are accessible to patients) be as low as feasible. 
Limited Resources 
It takes a lot of power (a finite resource) to run cryptographic methods, and that power must be 
maintained for a long period (long time). Surgery-dependent implants, for example, should last no 
more than a decade or two before they need to be replaced (at least). Additionally, many assaults 
attempt to deplete a device's battery, which is known as a Denial of Service (DoS) threats, to 
prevent it from effective operations. It is fundamental to remember that gadget receiver and 
evaluates signals from users who do not want to receive all of it. This could be a discharge on the 
battery system and could possible be problematic. In order to prevent medical equipment from 
responding to any harmful interactions, new control methods must be developed. 
 
Smart Vehicles challenges 
o 
The security assumptions that manufacturers make when integrating COTS and third-party elements in 
intelligent vehicles are at an odd. Automobile producers could ensure that COTS incorporation is stabilized 
and that various elements operate effectively before going into production. Make sure the maker of a vehicle 
doesn't compromise on security. 
o 
Many various forms of attacks (such as circumventing it and entering restricted bandwidths) may be employed 
against the gateway Electronic Control Units (ECU) [9]. To improve our vehicles, we may separate important 
and non-critical ECU by utilizing IP/Ethernet connection and replacing gateways and Master ECUs. 
o 
Other companies in the automotive sector manufacture or purchase (import) automobile parts and components. 
Buyers and sellers should pay greater attention to security, evaluation, and testing requirements to ensure there 
aren't any flaws. Manufacturers must consider safety from the outset of the design process. 
o 
The CAN network is susceptible because it is assumed to be isolated. There is a need for new protocols that 
take into account the possibility of hostile attackers. 
o 
New security issues will arise in the next several years for V2I (Vehicle-2-Infrastructure) and V2Vs (Vehicle-
2-Vehicle) connections. In order to prevent ineffective solutions from being implemented, it is necessary to 
use threats. 
 
As a result, this section examines many recently recognised key difficulties in smart cars, smart healthcare devices, and 
industrial control systems, among other areas of smart technology development. For medical cyber physical systems, the 
following part will focus on a number of issues. 
 
Challenges in Medical CPS 
Scientists and researchers will need to address a number of challenges in the Medical Cyber Physical Systems (MCPSs), 
some of which have already been raised in the preceding section. Note that Ref. [33] has some important information, such 
as the usage, unresolved problems, and difficulties of (in) MCPS. Other important issues with MCPS are highlighted in 
Table 8 below: 
Table 8. Medical CPS challenges  
 
Challenge  
Details 
High Assurance Software 
In order to automate hardware (such as security gates) and other functions on medical 
equipment, technology is used There is no doubt that software engineering is fundamental 
to make MCPS secure. 
Interoperability 
It is fundamental to ensure that medical instrument that operate in linkage are effective, 
secured, precise, certified and safe.  
Context awareness 
Data about the patient provided during system interaction may assist identify illness early 
and trigger alarms in crises, to provide good rationale of the general health of a patient.

Autonomy 
The device's analytical expertise may be utilised to make it more adaptable by enabling it to 
treat people in the most appropriate method for them at the moment. The loop should be 
securely and swiftly closed in this manner. 
Security and Privacy 
Because MCPSs gather health records and organize the information they acquire, security 
and privacy are of the utmost importance. As a result, it's critical that no unauthorised party 
has access to or alters their data. A patient's privacy, discrimination, abuse, or even physical 
harm might result from such an act. 
Certifiability 
MCPS requires a low-cost method of demonstrating that biomedical device software is safe 
and dependable, e.g., clinical device certifications. 
Executable clinical 
workflows 
MCPS may be built and deployed fast in order to deliver effective medical services for a 
(particular) patient since more and more healthcare systems are connecting and working 
together. With MCPS, patients' security is the foremost concern. Consequently, we must 
guarantee patient safety in these cases by employing medical protocols that are legitimate 
and effective. 
Model-based Development 
Prior to building or developing a software system, we will be able to determine how safe 
the situation is for patients, and we will be able to establish requirements for safe equipment 
and their connections. To ensure that the application is safe, these standards may be 
inspected during deployment. Take note of the way scenario analysis is carried out using 
MCPS model-based growth. Static and dynamic vulnerability checks are the most difficult 
to understand. 
Physiological close-loop 
control 
Many individuals dislike employing automated control in medical treatment for a variety of 
reasons, including regulating an application to a specific location, doing many treatments at 
once that might influence a variety of bodily system in patients. It should be noted that 
experiences will be unique.  
Patient Simulation and 
Modelling 
Patient modelling is essential if we are to analyse how distinct conditions and closed-loop 
controls operate. It is fundamental to keep watch on elements such as clients’ respiratory 
and heart rates in closed-loop PCA circumstances, as well as how much medication is being 
absorbed. More basic ways are needed to assist us in solving the difficulty of developing 
and analysing things. These techniques have the potential to simplify certain complex 
models. 
Adaptive Patient and 
smart alarms 
The majority of medical equipment is designed for use with several patients (having the 
same medical clinical conditions). In MCPS, patients may have a wide range of reactions to 
therapy, which may lead to confusion and loss of time. Most medical gadgets, for example, 
will sound an alert if a potentially harmful situation is discovered. Medical gadgets might 
potentially mistakenly send out false alerts. They don't have to deal with stuff like this in 
their line of work. For the benefit of patients and the collection of data for use in the 
creation of EHR Systems, healthcare systems are now establishing reliable network 
connections to accomplish this goal. 
In such situation, we'll need algorithms that can be customised to meet the unique 
requirements of each patient. Using the patient's activity record in EHR, we aim to alter 
alert settings so that there are less false alarms as well. Using "smart alarm services" in 
medical equipment in the near future will reduce the number of false alerts. 
User Centred Design 
If the caregiver is overworked or anxious or has difficulty operating a piece of equipment, 
they may make errors in their care. There are a number of ways that medical devices may 
be designed to be more user-friendly, such as providing interactive methods to learn how to 
operate the device in the event that the user gets stuck, and providing means for users to 
rectify errors so that they are satisfied with their gadgets. 
Infrastructure for 
Medical-Device 
Integration and 
Interoperability 
Distributed MCPS that use an exclusive network communication are currently being 
developed by just one business (lessening inter-device communication's advantages, while 
making regulatory clearance more straightforward). Open standards (interconnectivity) are 
the standard in the MCPS industry (establishing the foundation for medical device 
interoperability). It's still necessary for these standards to be utilised on systems that are 
simple to create and use. They must follow specific guidelines while making their goods so 
that they may function together and interface with each other in order to obtain the greatest 
benefit from them. 
Compositionality 
Using methods like contextual induction, it is possible to better understand how linked 
devices interact with one another, hence enhancing the security of MCPS systems. Figuring 
out how medical gadgets could interact in unexpected ways is the most challenging thing to 
 
ISSN: 2788 –7669                                                                                         Journal of Machine and Computing 2(3)(2022)

undertake in this scenario. Due to their proximity to one another, radio interference may 
occur between medical equipment that provide various therapies to the same patient. 
Treatments might conflict with one another if the body's response to them changes. A good 
example of this is "mixed prioritisation". The sensor's position in regard to the patient 
determines the MAP measurement's accuracy. The MAP measurement changes when the 
patient's bed, which is a Class I medical equipment, is elevated, since it is the least 
significant in the FDA classification. False reports or other undesirable behaviour might 
result from the sensor's abrupt shift when it is component monitoring things like vital signs. 
This issue was utilised to provide the monitoring system with more information. Making 
these gadgets while taking into account is difficult. 
Privacy and Security 
There are a number of networking capabilities built into medical equipment that, when 
combined, might contribute to security and privacy concerns. If a hacker gains entry to the 
MCPS network, they might hurt or even kill individuals (by re-programming devices). 
Rehired gadgets that may be rehired through the local area network but do not get any 
requests from the networks might be restricted in this way. There must be a delicate 
balancing between freedom of travel and the requirement for security. A strategy is needed 
for coping with EHR system problems. 
Verification, Validation 
and Certification 
When the design is complete, verification and validation are performed. Currently, this is 
how things are going. By using a "design for verification approach," it will be possible to 
demonstrate the validity of the verification process on an ever-larger scale [10]. It is also 
possible to do verification earlier in the design process thanks to a technology known as 
model-based generative approaches. Keep in mind that run-time components may be 
created from medical devices. 
High Assurance Software 
Some elements of medical equipment, such as hardware (such as security locks) and other 
things, are automated with the help of technology. It is commonly accepted that software 
development is essential to the security of MCPS, however this is not enough. 
 
IV. 
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE RESEARCH 
This paper focuses on security analysis in CPSs, whereby security in CPSs, security threats in CPSs, and security 
challenges in CPSs, have been discussed. A contemporary Cyber Physical Systems (CPSs) is at its peak in terms of 
engineering, making it intricate and multi-scale structures that are versatile. The systems are employed in various fields in 
real-life, and they have significantly attracted the attention of researchers and the academia. CPSs have not become 
popular, but there are some major segments of the fields, which are not appropriately defined or that not sufficiently 
studied. It necessitates more efforts to make CPSs function in real-life. This incorporates a broader range of 
interdisciplinary expertise, as well as tighter integration of important enabling technologies and a focus on environmental 
and societal concerns. It is essential for networks to have a shared language, abstract structures, modeling techniques, and 
protocols that function together in a coordinated manner. In order for abstraction to work properly in CPS testing, 
execution, design, and conceptualization, all of these processes need strong methodologies and theories (also computational 
and conceptual abstraction, i.e., that are fundamental for both computer and human agents). Computational reasoning has 
to be employed for autonomous control systems (for the physical system) and for discrete virtual structure (of the physical 
system) in order to facilitate the writing, connecting, and building of CPSs (with high integration levels). Different 
concepts, e.g., time-correct controls and operations, compositionality, synergy and goal-centric learning, among others, 
also require investigation in future studies.

Wireless technologies, despite their offered convenience, flexibility, low cost, and mobility pose unique challenges such as fading, interference, energy, and security, which must be carefully addressed when using resource-constrained IoT devices. To this end, the efforts of the research community have led to the standardization of several wireless technologies for various types of application domains depending on factors such as reliability, latency, scalability, and energy efficiency. In this paper, we first overview these standard wireless technologies, and we specifically study the MAC and physical layer technologies proposed to address the requirements and challenges of wireless communications. Furthermore, we explain the use of these standards in various application domains, such as smart homes, smart healthcare, industrial automation, and smart cities, and discuss their suitability in satisfying the requirements of these applications.

Introduction The Internet of Things (IoT) [1] refers to the inter-networking of everyday objects that are equipped with sensing, computation, and communication capabilities. These networks can collaboratively interact and perform a variety of tasks autonomously. IoT promises to play a remarkable role in diverse application domains, such as smart homes [2], medical care [3], [4], industrial automation [5], [6], intelligent transportation [7], [8], resource management [9], smart cities [10], [11], and energy management [12], [13], as shown in Figure 1. For example, in a smart home application, based on user prescribed settings, different monitoring and control tasks are carried out by smart sensors and actuators, such as the heating control system, air-condition monitoring, and fire alarms. Closely related to the IoT are Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication [14], Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) [15], Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPANs) [16] Wireless Sensors and Actuators Networks (WSANs) [17], [18], and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) [19], [20], which are application-dependent terms. FIGURE 1. Applications of IoT in different domains. Show All The entire vision of the IoT surrounds the concept of communication among smart objects, enabling them to see, hear, think, act, and talk to one another to make smart decisions. It fundamentally embeds intelligence into the objects by utilizing ubiquitous computing, networking technologies, inter-networking protocols, and applications [21]. Both wired and wireless networks are utilized to support information exchange at the backbone and local access networks. The local access networks, in particular, are wireless, support multi-hop communication, and enable mobility [22]. As these networks are usually low-power and unreliable, they are referred to as Low-Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) [23]. These networks lay the necessary foundation of IoT and contribute to making it highly accessible. The aspect of ubiquitous accessibility of services and objects to mobile users is imperative because most of the IoT services are targeted to mobile users. Another strong aspect is the autonomous operation, where IoT helps to decentralize the decision-making process to accomplish autonomous operations with minimal human intervention. This autonomous feature is of paramount importance for a multitude of industrial applications that enable smart processes and systems. This has amplified the vision of the fourth Industrial revolution, also known as the Industry-4.0 or smart factory [24]. Although IoT promises to revolutionize several application domains and enormously transform the way we live and communicate, it imposes challenging requirements from the networking point of view. The first essential requirement is reliable wireless network connectivity, which is particularly important for applications such as industrial process automation and control, healthcare, emergency situations, disaster recovery, home safety [25]. Second, timeliness or low latency are requirements that guarantee the bounded and deterministic delay of data transfer between different objects so that actions are performed on time. For example, industrial process control systems require real-time communication between machines and controllers. Third, the low-power operation requirement helps the nodes save power and avoid unnecessary communication attempts, thereby preventing early death and extending network lifetime. All of these requirements led to the development of several standards and technologies. These standards propose different features and protocols to satisfy the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of different IoT applications. However, the practical use of these standards in different IoT applications has resulted in several limitations. These limitations accelerated the need for further analysis in order to seek viable solutions to meet existing and future demands of IoT applications. In this paper, we review the existing low-power wireless standards and technologies. We primarily focus on the Physical (PHY) and Medium Access Control (MAC) layers because they directly impact several performance metrics, such as reliability, latency, scalability, and energy consumption. In this paper: We present an overview of some of the active standardization bodies that are working on the development of sophisticated standards and protocols for IoT. We discuss and analyze several low-power wireless standards and technologies. The Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) 802.15.4 standard and its derivations such as Thread, WirelessHART, IPv6 over Low Power Wireless Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN), and IPv6 Over TSCH (6TiSCH) are presented. We also study the Bluetooth standard and its variants, such as Bluetooth Basic Rate and Enhanced Data Rate (BR/EDR) and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Various technologies and standards that share common frequency bands, such as Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM), generate severe interference in a coexisting environment. We investigate how the inherent Physical (PHY) and Medium Access Control (MAC) layer design of these standards and technologies help to cope with interference issues. We explore the suitability of various standards across different IoT application domains, such as smart homes, smart cities, smart healthcare, and industrial automation. Possible limitations of each standard in different application domains are also highlighted. We emphasize the need to overcome the limitations of the existing standards to meet timeliness, reliability, scalability, and energy efficiency requirements of IoT applications. We explain how the stringent requirements of IoT applications and the constrained resources of objects introduce severe challenges in terms of protocol design. The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. In Section III, we discuss IEEE 802.15.4, in particular, its PHY and MAC features. Several standards based on IEEE 802.15.4 are also presented. Subsequently, we discuss how IEEE 802.15.4e overcomes the limitations of IEEE 802.15.4. Section IV describes Bluetooth and its radio and link layer working principles in detail. The discussion revolves around different versions of Bluetooth such as BR/EDR and BLE. Specifically, we demonstrate the communication principles in BLE such as beaconing and extended connectivity features. Additionally, we point out the limitations of each of the Bluetooth versions. Furthermore, we explain the BLE mesh specification. Section V presents the coexistence perspective of different standards and technologies that share the 2.4 GHz band. Other non-standard sources of interference are also described. In Section VI, we give an overview of the Z-wave standard. Section VII examines IEEE 802.11ah, which is another low-power wireless standard operating in sub-GHz. In Section VIII, the Long Range (LoRa) technology is presented. In Section IX, we discuss broad applications of IoT and their characteristics, requirements, and traffic categories. We explore the suitability of each standard relative to these application domains. In Section X we discuss the existing surveys relevant to IoT. Finally, a conclusion is drawn in Section XI. SECTION II. Standardization Bodies A large number of devices from different technologies and vendors makes the IoT environment quite heterogeneous, which causes interoperability issues across different application domains. To meet this challenge, we witness several standardization bodies that accelerated the development of low-power wireless standards and technologies. These standards employ unique PHY, MAC, network, and application layer enhancements to meet low-power, low-latency, high reliability, scalability, and security requirements of IoT applications. In the following, we describe some of the well-known standardization bodies that are actively working toward developing IoT protocols. IEEE Standards Association (IEEE-SA) [26] is the most well-known standardization organization. It mostly targets the lower layers in the OSI protocol stack, namely MAC and PHY. In this paper, we focus on IEEE 802.15.4, IEEE 802.15.1 (Bluetooth), and IEEE 802.11ah due to their low power operation. The IEEE 802.15.4 provides the fundamental blocks for many of the key technologies such as ZigBee, Thread, WirelessHART, and ISA100.11a. These standards are detailed in Section III. Up to 2017, IEEE-SA has published more than 1100 active standards, and it has more than 600 standards under development [27]. ZigBee alliance [28] is an open global standard based on IEEE 802.15.4 that is targeted to low-power wireless networks. The technical specifications of ZigBee are discussed in Section III. The most common applications of ZigBee are in home automation, industrial control, and healthcare. They will be described in Section IX. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) [29] is one of the non-profit organizations that developed IoT standards such as 6LoWPAN or Routing Over Low power and Lossy networks (ROLL). IETF encourages more people to communicate and collaborate on new ideas such as improving the IoT use cases in smart cities, healthcare, industrial Internet and other related applications by providing solutions to overcome issues such as scalability, timeliness, and IPv6 adaptation for low-power wireless networks. IETF provides a platform where developers and researchers can collaborate voluntarily to improve and build standards. The standard documents provided by the IETF, such as the Request for Comments (RFCs), can be accessed freely. For example, (RFC4944) [30] was developed in 2007 and updated by the drafts (RFC6282) [31], (RFC6775) [32], (RFC8025) [33], (RFC8066) [34] up until 2017 for developing 6LoWPAN standards. These documents cover a wide range of topics relating to issues of routing, security, and applications in IoT. The European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) [35] is another non-profit body (like IETF) that works for standardization organizations in Europe. It produces globally-applicable standards for communication technologies for the Internet, such as fixed, mobile, and broadcast, and short-range technologies. The Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP TM ) is an example of the ETSI standards. Currently, ETSI has 800 member organizations from 67 countries. OneM2M [36] is a worldwide organization formed in 2012 that aims to provide and develop technical specifications in order to meet architectural, security, and interoperability requirements for M2M communication. It targets applications such as smart cities, smart grids, smart homes, and healthcare. OneM2M cooperates with more than 200 companies. International Society of Automation (ISA) [37] targets industrial IoT covering applications such as security, safety, batch control, and enterprise integration. A widely-adopted standard developed by this body is ISA100.11a [38]. ISA has more than 40,000 members and 140 committees, subcommittees, working groups, and task forces that are working to develop the ISA standards. OpenWSN [39] is a project created by the University of California, Berkeley. It aims to provide an open source platform for developers and researchers to implement the IoT protocol stack. The stack implements different hardware and operating systems, such as OpenMote [40] and RIOT [41], respectively. One of the important goals of OpenWSN is the adaptation of the Time-Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) concept over IEEE 802.15.4e. TSCH provides the IPv6 support in the network layer based on the IETF 6TiSCH implementation [42]. We will discuss TSCH in Section III-H. Internet Protocol for Smart Object (IPSO) alliance [43] is an active organization for enabling Internet Protocol (IP) connectivity for smart object communication in IoT. IPSO was founded in 2008 and targets IoT applications, such as smart cities, home automation, healthcare, and energy management. Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) [44] developed and licensed Bluetooth technology. It is a non-profit organization that was founded in September 1998. This body publishes the core specifications for the different version of Bluetooth. In Section IV, we will describe the different versions of Bluetooth developed by SIG. Currently, SIG is supported by more than 30,000 member companies [45]. Although SIG does not sell any Bluetooth products, it owns the Bluetooth word mark, figure mark and combination mark, which collectively make up the Bluetooth trademarks. SECTION III. IEEE 802.15.4 IEEE 802.15.4 [46], which mainly defines PHY and MAC layer specifications, is considered the defacto standard for Low Rate Wireless Personal Area Network (LR-WPAN). The standard was developed for low data rate monitoring and control applications that require very low power consumption. Due to its appealing features such as low-power, low cost, and moderate data rate, it is the most widely used standard for home automation [47], industrial automation [48], [49], smart cities [50], and Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs) [51]. Most of the existing standards, such as ZigBee [28], WirelessHART [52], and ISA100.11a [53], employ IEEE 802.15.4 as the PHY layer technology together with certain upper layer modifications. At the MAC layer, the standard offers a flexible protocol that tries to achieve a better trade-off among several performance metrics, such as energy efficiency, delay, coverage, and data rate. The IEEE 802.15.4 network supports star, tree, and peer-to-peer network topologies as shown in Figure 2. The network is composed of two types of devices, namely Full Function Device (FFD) and Reduced Function Device (RFD). The FFDs can perform activities like network coordination, routing, and sensing, whereas the RFDs are constrained nodes that can only serve as end-devices to perform sensing tasks. As coordinators, FFDs can form, manage, and maintain a Personal Area Network (PAN), but a FFD can manage only a single PAN at a time. The FFDs can also serve as routers that relay traffic through intermediate routes from source to destination. They can also store routing tables. FIGURE 2. The star and peer-to-peer network topologies supported by the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. Show All The following discussion elaborates more on the PHY and MAC layer specifications of the standard. A. PHY Layer The PHY layer uses the 2.4 GHz ISM [54] frequency band. Different frequency bands are allocated to different regions, as listed in Table 2. TABLE 1 Abbreviations TABLE 2 Frequency Bands of the IEEE 802.15.4 Standard TABLE 3 Bluetooth 5 Support SoC Comparison The PHY offers services such as the transmission and reception of PHY Protocol Data Units (PPDUs) across the physical channel. It performs a number of suitable functionalities like the activation and deactivation of radio transceiver, Energy Detection (ED), Link Quality Indication (LQI), Clear Channel Assessment (CCA), channel frequency selection, and packet transmission and reception [46]. The purpose of the ED is to estimate the power of the received signal within the bandwidth of the channel so that the MAC layer can avoid interference. CCA is a reliable method to determine any activity on the channel before making a transmission. CCA works based on multiple sampling of channel energy. For example, it may sample the channel five times and report a free channel if there is at least one sample less than the noise floor. There are total 27 different channels available across all of the bands as defined by the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. For example, the 2.4 GHz band includes 16 channels numbered from 11 to 25, where each channel has a bandwidth of 2 MHz and center frequencies are separated by 5 MHz. They offer an achievable data rate of as much as 250 kbps [55]. IEEE 802.15.4 uses Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) which mainly supports coexistence by spreading the signal over a larger bandwidth. Upon receiving a request from the MAC sub-layer, the radio transceiver may operate in one of the three states: transmit, receive, or sleep. The energy consumption states of a transceiver can be classified into the following states: transmission, reception, and sleep. During idle listening, the device is listening to incoming packets, which may result in overhearing packets that are not destined for it [56]. It is observed that in most of the commercial IEEE 802.15.4 compliant transceivers the energy consumed during idle listening is almost the same as receiving or transmitting a packet [57] and is a significant cause of energy waste. For example, the TI CC2420 transceiver at 0 dBm output power consumes 17.4 mA in transmission and 18.8 mA in idle listening states [58]. Since nodes have constrained resources, the IEEE 802.15.4 implements duty cycling in the MAC protocol to save power. Duty cycling allows a node to sleep by turning off its transceivers to conserve energy periodically. B. MAC Layer The standard proposes a flexible MAC that can mainly switch between two channel access modes known as beacon enabled mode and non-beacon enabled mode. 1) Beacon Enabled (BE) Mode In this mode, communication is based on a superframe structure. The superframe starts with a beacon period followed by an active period and an inactive period, as shown in Figure 3. The active period consists of the Contention Access Period (CAP) and Contention Free Period (CFP), while the inactive period allows duty cycling. The active period is further subdivided into 16 equally spaced parts called time slots. The superframe information is broadcasted through beacons at the start of the network. A beacon is a specific frame generated periodically by the PAN coordinator to update synchronization and other network related information among the nodes. A superframe is bounded by two beacons. After the beacon, the CAP immediately starts where nodes compete, using slotted Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) to transmit new packets to the coordinator or request pending packets. To minimize the probability of collisions over the channel, slotted CSMA/CA uses the Binary Exponential (BE) Backoff algorithm. After the CAP is the CFP, which contains Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) like Guaranteed Time Slots (GTSs) for transmission. GTSs are allocated by the coordinator to the nodes that require special bandwidth reservations [59]. Nodes request the GTSs from the PAN coordinator during the CAP. GTS can be used either for transmission or reception, and a maximum of seven GTSs are allowed per superframe. During the GTS, the node has exclusive access to the channel at its disposal. FIGURE 3. The superframe structure of the BE MAC mode of IEEE 802.15.4 standard. Show All The total duration of the superframe, including active and inactive periods, can be configured through two important parameters known as Superframe Order (SO) and Beacon Order (BO). The network coordinator defines the superframe structure by a Beacon Interval (BI), which is the time between two sequential beacons, and a Superframe Duration (SD), which is the active duration of the superframe, as shown in Figure 3. The values of BO and BI are related as follows [46]; for 0≤ BI= BO≤14 α× 2 BO symbols View Source α is known as aBaseSuperframeDuration, which is the number of symbols forming a superframe when the SO is equal to zero. The SO defines the duration of the active period including the beacon frame. The values of SO and SD are related as follows: for 0≤ SD= SO≤BO≤14 α× 2 SO symbols View Source Therefore, in the case of 2.4 GHz, the value of SD=15.36× 2 SO  ms with a BI=15.36× 2 BO  ms . Thus, the value of BI can be adjusted between 15 ms to 245 s [59], depending on the value of BO and SO. 2) Non-Beacon Enabled (NBE) Mode No GTS allocation is employed in this mode. Nodes mainly utilize unslotted CSMA/CA for channel access and perform only a single CCA operation without synchronization to backoff boundaries [60]. C. Limitations of IEEE 802.15.4 Mac Although IEEE 802.15.4 MAC has several appealing features for general IoT applications, yet it has several limitations for applications that require high reliability, low latency, and energy efficiency, as pointed out in [61] and [62]. To address this issue, several investigations on the performance analysis of IEEE 802.15.4 MAC were conducted [63]–[66]. Studies in [67] show that the selection of the binary exponent is random and does not take into account the number of available nodes, the communication activity level, or the priority of data packets, resulting in a higher likelihood of collisions. The random nature of the binary exponent causes nodes to sleep for prolonged periods than required. This leaves the medium unnecessarily idle for an extended period, impacting the throughput. A simulation-based evaluation of slotted Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA) for beacon-enabled mode for dense networks was conducted in [66]. The authors showed that the backoff algorithm is not flexible for large-scale networks, since the lower limit of the backoff delay is always 0 which is fixed. Thus, it prevents particular ranges for the backoff delays. Therefore, it is not sufficient to avoid collisions for large-scale networks. The impact on the selection of the BO and SO was analyzed based on the average delay. A node that cannot complete its data transmission in the current CAP is forced to defer its transmission to the following superframe. Therefore, the node has to re-contend to access the medium and face collisions. Such a situation makes the delay for the data transmission not only non-deterministic and unbounded, but it also deteriorates the throughput. Another study on the performance of slotted CSMA/CA for the BE mode was conducted in [63]. The authors showed that the default values of MAC parameters, such as MAC minimum binary exponent and number of backoffs, may result in lower throughput and high-power consumption. This analytical study was based on the Markov model for both saturated and unsaturated periodic traffic, and it was suggested to tune the MAC parameters to achieve better results. Anastasi et al. [64] gave a comprehensive analysis on the MAC unreliability problem. The authors argued that if the power management is enabled, it will result in poor packet delivery ratio. The reason was found to be the contention access period and its default parameters, such as the minimum and maximum binary exponent value, the maximum number of backoffs, and maximum frame retries allowed. The authors suggested that the MAC, in its current form, is not suitable for mission-critical applications and requires proper tuning of the MAC parameters for better performance. Motivated by these shortcomings, several relevant standards and protocols emerged to overcome the limitations of IEEE 802.15.4 MAC [68], [69]. We overview these protocols and standards as follows. We will present different applications based on this standard and elaborates further on their suitability in each application domain in Section IX. D. Thread Thread [70] is an open networking stack, which has received support from well-known organizations such as Google, Samsung, Nest, Freescale, and ARM [71]. It is built on top of the IEEE 802.15.4 PHY and MAC layer specifications, operating in 2.4 GHz band. It is cost-effective, reliable, secure, works at very low-power, and supports up to 250 devices in a single local mesh network. The technology is optimized for low latency (less than 100 ms) and smart home networking applications, such as access control, energy management, and light control. It does not suffer from a single point of failure due to its mesh networking capability, thus improving reliability. It natively supports 6LoWPAN technology to benefit IPv6 capability in order to support interoperability. In this way, devices can be directly connected to the Internet and can be accessed from anywhere. Figure 4 shows the mesh network architecture of Thread. As shown, a typical Thread network consists of at least one or more border routers, a router, a leader, sleepy end-devices, and end-devices. The border router serves as a gateway that is responsible for connecting a Thread network to an adjacent non-Thread network that operates on other physical layers like IEEE 802.11 or Ethernet. Multiple border routers can be deployed to achieve redundancy. This keeps the mesh network functional in case of a failure of the single border router, thereby improving resiliency. A router offers routing services to the network devices. It also provides security and network joining services for the devices that wish to join the network. A router or border router can act as a leader which is required to make decisions for some specific functions like assigning router addresses and allowing new router requests. FIGURE 4. The mesh networking architecture of Thread. Show All Sleepy end-devices can communicate through their parent router and serve as only host devices, but they cannot forward messages for other devices. End-devices can exchange messages with their parent devices. At the application layer, Thread does not impose any particular application layer protocol, however, the common light-weight protocols, such as Constrained Application Protocol (COAP), Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT), and Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), can be used. The standard implements several security enhancements; it supports Transport Layer Security (TLS) [72] and its variant, Datagram TLS (DTLS) [73]. A network-wide key is used at the MAC that protects the IEEE 802.15.4 data frames against eavesdropping, tampering, and targeted disruption from outsiders. Since Thread and ZigBee mostly share the same physical specifications and have several features in common, it is expected that they are likely to merge in order to create a uniform IoT standard [74]. Although Thread claims to have all of the features mentioned above, there are no practical implementations or deployments available based on Thread standard. E. IEEE 802.15.4E IEEE 802.15.4, in its 2011 version [46], supports enhanced physical specifications that enable a variety of applications (see section III-A). However, the standard cannot support mission-critical applications due to several limitations. Specifically, in order to meet reliability, low latency, and low-power consumption, which are the requirements of emerging applications like Cyber Physical System (CPS) based Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) [75], [76], smart health care [77], and industrial process automation and control, IEEE released an enhanced version known as the IEEE 802.15.4e [78]. It specifically introduces five enhanced MAC protocols in the form of MAC behavior modes. These protocols will be elaborated in the subsequent discussion. 1) Deterministic and Synchronous Multi-Channel Extension (DSME) DSME is an extension of the beacon-enabled MAC mode of the IEEE 802.15.4. DSME does not rely on a single channel. Instead, it uses multiple channels and has a multi-superframe structure, which has an extended number of GTSs. A multi-superframe consists of a collection of consecutive non-overlapping superframes as shown in Figure 5. The multi-superframe structure can flexibly support both periodic and a periodic traffic. DSME mainly targets multi-hop networks and uses Enhanced Beacons (EBs), which are shown as black bars inside the multi-superframe in Figure 5. EBs are used to announce the presence of the network and contain information related to the size of the time slots, slot frames, and time synchronization information to maintain synchronization among the network nodes. The superframe consists of only the active period, which is further subdivided into CAP and CFP. Nodes in the CAP use slotted CSMA/CA for channel access to transmit monitoring, urgent, or a periodic data. The CAP is fixed to 8-time slots during which the nodes should stay awake. The CFP occupies the remaining seven slots that are known as the Guaranteed Time Slots (GTSs) (DSME-GTSs), which are used to transmit time-critical data. As mentioned before, nodes remain awake during the CAP; however, in order to save energy, DSME reduces the number of CAP periods, and only the first superframe of each multi-superframe uses the CAP. The rest of the superframes inside the multi-superframe structure do not make use of the CAP, but rather the whole period is treated as a CFP that consists of 15 GTSs, as shown in Figure 3 (Section III-B). DSME exploits channel diversity to select the best possible channel in order to ensure reliability and robustness against external interference and multi-path fading. Therefore, it is particularly suitable for factory automation, smart metering, and patient health monitoring. FIGURE 5. The multi-superframe structure of DSME MAC mode with extended and reduced CAP. The shaded bars show the CFP consisting of GTSs and the white bars show CAP. (a) DSME multi-superframe with extended CAP. (b) DSME multi-superframe with reduced CAP. Show All DSME MAC mode is scalable due to its distributed nature. Specifically, slot allocation and beacon scheduling are not performed by a central entity, but rather they are performed by the network devices themselves in a distributed fashion. It is adaptive to time-varying traffic conditions and to changes in network topology, where each pair of nodes, based on their needs, allocates and deallocates GTS slots. Due to its adaptive capability, it can be a good candidate for mobile networks, where data rate requirements and topology vary over time. It improves energy efficiency through its Group Acknowledgement (GACK) option, where a single Acknowledgement (ACK) frame aggregates the acknowledgments of multiple data frames. Although DSME MAC presents significant enhancements, some of its shortcomings have been identified as follows. For example, Rodenas-Herraiz et al. [79] pointed out the overhead of topology change in large-scale networks. In particular, the overhead may be high due to the rescheduling of beacon frames and/or selection of non-interfering frequency channels, assuming the multi-superframe structure is long enough and contains superframes of all coordinators. This increases the energy expenditure of the devices. On the other hand, in a dense network, DSME incurs considerable delays due to the TDMA multi-superframe structure, where the coordinator and the devices become active only in their respective superframes. Therefore, if the part of data transmission cannot be completed in the current superframe, it needs to be deferred to the following superframe. The coordinator and its associated devices would have to wait for the next multi-superframe to resume their transmission. 2) The Low Latency Deterministic Network (LLDN) LLDN targets applications that require low latency, such as manufacturing and robotics. It only works with the star topology and uses TDMA superframe time slots with small packets. The duration of the superframe is fixed and has distinctive slots, namely the beacon, management, uplink, and bidirectional time slots. The duration of a time slot is 10 ms, and the number of time slots determines the number of devices that can communicate. Since the size of the superframe is restricted to a certain number of time slots, it only allows a certain number of devices to participate in the network. However, in order to make the network scalable up to more than 100 devices, the PAN coordinator can use multiple transceivers that each operate on a different frequency. Moreover, in order to further reduce latency, LLDN makes use of short MAC addresses to decrease frame processing and transmission time. Similar to DSME, it also exploits the GACK mechanism to minimize the bandwidth overhead. The use of star topology makes LLDN more suitable for factory automation, where a large number of nodes often communicate with a central entity. However, it has some limitations in terms of scalability, topology, and throughput. The standard recommends using multiple transceivers in the PAN coordinator to create various networks operating on different channels. However, a study by Patti et al. [80] argues that this recommendation imposes a higher cost and greater complexity. They propose multi-channel LLDN, which improves scalability by allowing a higher number of nodes in the network while maintaining low cycle times without the need of multiple transceivers for the PAN coordinator. Berger et al. [81] indicate that using a star topology restricts coverage. They propose the extension of the star topology, which is to collect data from two-hop sensors with the use of a relay node strategy. The relay nodes improve transmission reliability by retransmitting undelivered packets. The authors are of the view that the use of reserved slots and retransmission strategy in default LLDN reduces the number of sensor nodes per network, which impacts data throughput. 3) The Time - Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) TSCH MAC is considered one of the latest generations of MAC protocols in the category of reliable and low-power operation. It aims to satisfy the requirements of low-power mesh networks in industrial process automation. TSCH is considered the most viable MAC candidate for the IoT protocol stack because of its time and channel diversity features [82]. It incorporates mechanisms such as time-slotted access and multiple channel communication with channel hopping. Time-slotted channel access inherently avoids the nodes that are competing for the channel, eliminating collisions and improving throughput. It provides every network node guaranteed access to the wireless medium, offering deterministic latency, and builds on a communication schedule that coordinates the exchange of information among the nodes. In this way, each node exactly knows when to transmit, receive, or sleep. TSCH achieves low-power through synchronization, causing the receiver to be active precisely when the sender transmits. The improved design of TSCH is influenced by Time Synchronized Mesh Protocol (TSMP) which is a proprietary MAC protocol designed by the Dust Networks [83]. TSMP became the widely accepted MAC protocol in the industrial domain, and in particular, is adopted by WirelessHART [84] for its MAC operation [52]. Standards like ISA100.11a [53] and WIA-PA [85] use the core concepts of TSMP in their MAC design, alongside some higher layer packet format modifications. Below, we present an overview of the TSCH slot frame and its functionality. The earlier MAC protocol of IEEE 802.15.4 (see section III-B) used a single channel approach in combination with the backoff algorithm in order to avoid collisions in a shared medium. TSCH takes a multi-channel approach by utilizing channel hopping and maintaining a low duty cycle. Channel hopping intelligently mitigates external interference and multi-path fading [86], which makes TSCH highly reliable and robust. Today, TSCH commercial products offer 99.9% end-to-end reliability while consuming an average current that is below 50 μA at 3.6 V [87]. TSCH Slotframe: A slot frame combines several time slots that repeat periodically, as shown in Figure 6a. FIGURE 6. TSCH slotframe schedule based on the associated topology. (a) TSCH slotframe, it also shows sequence of transmission events within a timeslot for a transmitter-receiver node pair. (b) The associated topology where dotted arrows show transmission in shared slots and solid arrows represent transmission in dedicated slots. Show All Not only does this periodic repetition of slot frame provide each node the opportunity to communicate in the network, but it also helps to update synchronization and other network related information. TSCH does not define and impose a slot frame size; instead, the slot frame size is a design parameter that is decided by the application programmer. The size of the slot frame can be from 0 to 1000 time slots [88]. Enhanced beacons are sent by the nodes to advertise the network. A time slot is long enough to send a maximum size packet and receive its corresponding ACK. A typical value of the time slot duration is suggested to be 10 ms. If an ACK is not received in a defined time period, the retransmission will follow the subsequent time slot that is scheduled for the same (transmitter-receiver) pair of nodes. A possible communication schedule is depicted in Figure 6a. The slot frame is seven slots long, and there are sixteen channel offsets available. Each link is assigned a cell. Some of the cells could be dedicated to only one pair of nodes, while others could be shared cells, i.e., more than one pair of nodes can communicate in these slots. There could be a possibility of collision in a shared slot, but the standard implements a simple back-off scheme to deal with it. Each node only cares about the cell it is assigned to. For example, in Figure 6a, when node n 5 transmits a packet to node n 0 , it uses time slot 3 from the dedicated time slots and channel offset (Ch.05) . F. WirelessHART WirelessHART [84] is the first open wireless industrial standard, introduced by the HART (Highway Addressable Remote Transducer) [89] foundation. It is mainly designed for industrial process measurements and control applications while still being backward compatible with the HART legacy systems. It is a mesh network with self-organizing and self-healing capabilities in combination with a secure and reliable communication protocol. Although Bluetooth and ZigBee were prevalent before the release of WirelessHART, they could not fulfill the stringent requirements of industrial control applications [52]. Specifically, neither ZigBee nor Bluetooth offered guaranteed end-to-end delay and reliability. 1) Network Architecture WirelessHART introduces different types of devices in the network as shown in Figure 7: network and security manager, gateways, access points, and field devices. The network manager is responsible for computing and maintaining the communication schedule and routing tables, as well as performing the overall network health monitoring. It can query a particular field device through the gateway as requested by the host application. The security manager and network manager work collaboratively to provide security against intrusion and attacks by generating a different session, joint, and network keys [90]. FIGURE 7. WirelessHART network architecture showing communication among different kinds of devices. Show All 2) PHY and MAC Layers The PHY layer is based on IEEE 802.15.4 [55]. TSMP is the medium access and networking protocol which offers reliable, robust, and low-power communication. It features time synchronized, dedicated time-slotted access, link layer ACKs, graph-based routing, and multi-layer security on every packet. It targets reliability of greater than 99.99% at low-power, scalability of hundreds of mesh nodes, flexibility to support time-varying traffic, security, and the ability to withstand harsh industrial environments [91]. The communication is governed by a time-slotted schedule which lets the nodes know when to transmit, receive, or sleep. TSMP follows the same schedule scheme as of TSCH, where the schedule is computed and is represented through cells using different time slots and channel offsets as described in Section III-E3. G. Ipv6 Over Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN) The underlying motivation to standardize 6LoWPAN [92], [93] was the need to integrate constrained devices to the Internet. IETF created the 6LoWPAN and Routing Over Low-Power and Lossy Networks (ROLL) [23] working groups with the goal toward standardized IP-based protocols for LLN. The ROLL focuses on developing routing solutions for LLNs over IPv6. The fact that the IPv6 protocol imposes high overhead and complexity which makes it difficult to be deployed in constrained environments, such as the IEEE 802.15.4 network. Since the MAC payload of IEEE 802.15.4 cannot be larger than 127 bytes, the 40-byte header of IPv6 does not leave much space for actual payload. This prompted the need to form an adaptation layer between the network and data link layer in order to enable IPv6 packets to fit into the IEEE 802.15.4 specifications. Low Power Wireless Personal Area Networks (LoWPANs) impose several constraints, such as small packet sizes, different address lengths, small bandwidth, high density of nodes, battery operated devices, poor link quality, and duty cycling. This makes it challenging to develop an optimized adaptation sublayer to successfully map the service required by the network layer on the services provisioned by the link layer [93]. In essence, 6LoWPAN defines an adaptation layer through header compression (HC) in order to transmit IPv6 packets over the IEEE 802.15.4 network. It supports packet fragmentation and reassembly in order to meet the Maximum Transfer Unit (MTU) requirements of IPv6, and it allows forwarding to the data link layer for multi-hop connections [94]. The 6LoWPAN adaptation layer defines two header compression techniques that compress large IPv6 headers (in the best case) to several bytes. The compression technique, 6LoWPAN-HC1, compresses IPv6 packets that contain IPv6 link-local addresses. The size of the packet is minimized by eliminating fields such as IP version, traffic class, flow label, and hop limit. The 6LoWPAN-HC2 technique is proposed for the compression of UDP, TCP, and ICMP. The main objective in proposing the HC1 and HC2 techniques was to perform compression in a stateless manner that did not require any previous agreements between the two nodes. H. 6TiSCH IETF formed 6TiSCH [95] working group to support IPv6 over TSCH (see Section III-E). 6TiSCH contributes to the IoT by bonding the unique features of TSCH and IP networking mechanisms in order to produce an interoperable Industrial IoT (IIoT) protocol stack [96]. This will support TSCH MAC being placed under an IPv6 enabled protocol stack running 6LoWPAN, IPv6 RPL [97], [98], and CoAP [99], [100]. Figure 8 shows the reference protocol stack for 6TiSCH [101]. For the successful integration of TSCH with upper layer protocols, 6TiSCH introduces a functional entity that is responsible for scheduling TSCH time slots to be sent on the network. This entity resides at the higher layer and is known as 6TiSCH Operation Sublayer (6top). FIGURE 8. Envisioned 6TiSCH protocol stack [101]. Show All 6top is a logical link control that resides between the IP layer and the TSCH MAC layer. It controls the TSCH schedule, collects the connectivity graph, and monitors and optimizes the schedule of the cells. It supports both centralized and distributed scheduling approaches. The scheduled cells are labeled as either hard cells or soft cells. Hard cells cannot be dynamically reallocated by 6top. Rather, they are typically scheduled by a scheduling entity such as Path Computation Entity (PCE), that can move or delete cells in the TSCH schedule. In contrast, soft cells can be reallocated by the 6top dynamically. Typically, a distributed scheduling entity schedules these cells. 6top records the performance of the cells to the same neighbor. If a cell performs poorly compared to the other cells with the same neighbor, it moves the cell to a different channelOffset and slotOffset, where channelOffset and slotOffset perform better. In this way, the 6top sublayer can cope with the interference reliably. SECTION IV. Bluetooth In this Section, we discuss the history of Bluetooth technology and technical details such as radio, link layer, and network topology. Bluetooth is a low-power wireless technology used for short-range communication. It was designed to replace serial cables with the wireless links [102]. Nowadays, aside from connecting devices like mice, keyboards, cell phones, headsets, and multimedia devices, it is used to connect sensors, actuators, controllers, and critical wireless infrastructures. Availability is one of the main advantages of Bluetooth. The Allied Business Intelligence (ABI) research group predicted that by 2021 there would be 48 billion devices connected to the Internet, 30% of which would be Bluetooth enabled [103]. Bluetooth was introduced in 1999, and the first specification was released in 2001 [104]. In 2002, IEEE assigned the 802.15.1 standard for it [105]. The technology is divided into two major categories: First, Bluetooth Basic Rate and Enhanced Data Rate (BR/EDR) refers to the earlier versions of Bluetooth mainly designed for file transmission and audio streaming. It is reported that in 2015, 116.32 million BR/EDR headsets were shipped [106]. Second, BLE refers to the recent versions of Bluetooth targeting low-power consumption for IoT applications. Due to the consumer demand for low-power and high throughput, both BLE and BR/EDR are available in some devices like smartphones and laptops. They are known as dual-mode Bluetooth and switch the protocol stack from BR/EDR to BLE and vice versa when is needed [107]. Table 4 highlights the key features of each version. TABLE 4 Comparison of Bluetooth Standards A. Bluetooth Basic Rate and Enhanced Data Rate The first version of BR/EDR was only designed for file sharing by using an Asynchronous Connection-Less (ACL) link. The link is a single point-to-multiple point link that can be used for broadcasting data and can support both asymmetrical and symmetrical connection. The audio streaming capability has been added to BR/EDR by using a Synchronous Connection-Oriented (SCO) link in v1.2. The new link provides up to three symmetrical point-to-point links that reserve time slots in order to guarantee timely transmission. To avoid delay in voice transmission, SCO packets do not deliver ACKs. In 2003, SIG enhanced the link and released eSCO to improve voice transmission reliability. The higher quality is achieved by employing a limited number of re-transmissions for lost or damaged packets. Additionally, this version employs Adaptive Frequency Hopping (AFH) to improve coexistence with other wireless protocols [108] (Section V discusses AFH in detail). Bluetooth versions up to v1.2 provide a maximum throughput of 721.2 kbps, known as Bluetooth Basic Rate (BR). Due to the high demand for large file and audio transmission, BR was unable to fulfill the throughput requirements. Therefore, in 2004, SIG introduced Bluetooth v2.0 to improve throughput and named it as Bluetooth Enhanced Data Rate (EDR). This version increased the throughput by 2.1 Mbps by using the Differential Phase Shift Keying (DPSK) modulation technique [109]. Although EDR tries to improve the data rate, it does not satisfy the entire user requirements. Thus, in April 2009, SIG launched Bluetooth v3.0, known as Bluetooth High Speed (HS) [110]. Bluetooth HS delivers up to a 24 Mbps data rate by using the 802.11 radio. Alternative MAC/PHY (AMP) controller [111] changes the radio from BR/EDR to 802.11 and vice versa. AMP enables the 802.11’s radio when higher throughput is required. After that, it reverts to primary BR/EDR radio to save power. 1) BR/EDR Radio The radio operates on the 2.4 GHz ISM band at frequencies between 2402 to 2480 MHz. It uses Gaussian Frequency Shift Keying (GFSK) modulation with three output power classes: class one has the maximum output power 100 mW and achieving communication range 100 m, class two and class three support output power 2.4 mW and 1 mW, respectively. The communication range of class two and class three is almost 10 m. Power classification improves energy efficiency and avoids interference with other networks by reducing the communication range. For example, a few meter communication ranges satisfy the user requirement for Bluetooth headphones and a smartphone. Lowering the signal propagation range reduces noise for other wireless networks in the vicinity. The physical channel is subdivided into 1, 3, or 5 time slots; each time slot is 625 μs and Time Division Duplex (TDD) provides full duplex transmission. In TDD, both the uplink and downlink can transmit information in the same frequency by using a synchronized time interval which resolves contention over the wireless channel. In BR/EDR, the frequency band is divided into 79 channels, and each channel is 1 MHz wide. Figure 9(a) shows the channel assignment of BR/EDR. The radio uses the Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS) technique to avoid interference from any coexisting Bluetooth devices with other technologies that share the same frequency band. In the FHSS technique, the radio switches the transmission channels 1600 times per second; therefore, if a transmission encounters noise on one channel, there is a chance that the next channel would be free of noise. In Bluetooth v1.2, AFH added a technique that blacklists the channels based on traffic load as good or bad channels. This minimizes the chance of collision by only performing transmission in the good channels. FIGURE 9. BR/EDR, BLE, IEEE 802.15.4, and IEEE 802.11 sharing 2.4 GHz frequency band. Show All 2) Network Topology In BR/EDR, devices communicate in a network called a piconet. A piconet is a star based topology, in which a node can only communicate with a central node called master and the others are called slaves. In the master node, the built-in clock is responsible for synchronizing master-slaves communication. The slave nodes receive an inquiry message from the master node to identify the address and clock phase. With this information, the slave nodes can compute the channel hopping sequence to identify when and on what channel to listen. The slaves can only initiate communication after receiving permission from the master node. There are two types of slave nodes: active and parked. In a piconet, one master, up to seven active slaves, and up to 255 parked slaves can coexist. Therefore, in order to address the active and parked slaves, three and eight bits are required respectively. The master node continuously polls the active slaves to see if they have data to transmit. If an active slave does not respond to the polling for a long period, it loses its three-bit active slave address and becomes a parked slave by obtaining an eight-bit address. For the parked slaves to rejoin the network, the master node periodically checks their status if they have any data to transmit. If so, the master node reassigns the three-bit active slave address. Since each piconet uses its own frequency pattern that is generated by the master node, it would be possible for several piconets to coexist. As shown in Figure 10, neighboring piconets can join and construct a new network topology called a scatternet. A scatternet is a combination of two or more piconets through node sharing. With this, a slave can be shared by two piconets, or it can be a master in one piconet and a slave in another. In this way, by combining piconets, Bluetooth can extend the number of nodes in the network. For example, in Figure 10, the nodes are organized into three piconets: A, B and C. However, the piconets can communicate with each other using the shared nodes. The shared node between piconets A and B switches the roles from a slave in A to a master in B and vice versa. On the other hand, the shared node in piconets B and C remain as a slave in both. FIGURE 10. A sample of Bluetooth scatternet formation. Although Bluetooth is a star-based technology, node role switching enables connection establishment with other networks in vicinity. Show All 3) Link Controller Bluetooth does not support the OSI model or the TCP/IP protocol stack because it has its own MAC protocol for communication management called the link controller. Figure 11 shows the state diagram of the link controller in BR/EDR. There are three primary states: standby, connection, and park. The standby state is the default state that waits for the connection event. It is designed to save power when the connection is not required. The connection state is when the BR/EDR radio turns on to discover devices in the vicinity and starts exchanging information if they are ready to communicate. Park mode is a deep sleep mode that helps to save power when the connection is not required for a long period. Only slaves can switch to this mode. They receive the synchronization packet periodically, and, once received, they can then join the network whenever it is needed. Before switching from the standby mode to the connection state, there are some sub-states such as Device Discovery and connection establishment. The connection establishment sub-state discovers the devices that are willing to initiate the connection. The Device Discovery sub-state has three sections. In the inquiry section, the device that attempt to initiate the connection hops among 32 out of the 79 channels, which are known as the inquiry channels, and broadcasts ID packets. For channel hopping, it uses the built-in clock and pseudo-random numbers to generate the pattern. On the other side, the device that is about to become discoverable switches to the inquiry scan state and waits for the expected ID packets in the inquiry channel. It listens for 1.28 s in every channel. It switches the channels slower than the device that broadcasts the ID packet in order to increase the probability of handshake at the same time and the same channel. After receiving the ID packet, it replies in the inquiry response state with the Frequency Hop Synchronization (FHS) packet. The packet contains the node’s address, the clock value, and value used for synchronization. After the devices are discovered and the packets have been exchanged, the connection establishment sub-state starts. This state is much faster than the inquiry state because both devices know each other’s frequency and clock information. The previously discovering device changes to the page state and becomes the master node while the discovered device changes the state to page scanning and becomes the slave. After defining the roles, the connection state starts. The master polls the slaves and waits for the response from the slaves. During the connection state, the device can be in one of three modes: sniff, active and hold. In the active mode, the master node keeps scheduling the slaves by transmitting POLL packets. The packet exchange stops in the hold mode, and the master and slave nodes get informed about the duration of time that they need to hold. The sniff mode is designed to save the battery. In this mode, during the connection the device can be temporarily absent from the piconet. For example, a device that is not operating, such as a mouse or keyboard, puts itself in sniff mode and transitions to the active mode when needed. FIGURE 11. Link controller state for BR/EDR designed for communication establishment and power saving. Show All 4) Limitations of BR/EDR Two major limitations of BR/EDR are high power consumption and lack of scalability. Although BR/EDR uses the standby state, parked mode, and effective duty cycling to save energy, these techniques are not enough to guarantee the low-power consumption requirement of some IoT applications. A major disadvantage of BR/EDR is high power consumption. This is because of continuous polling of the slave nodes by the master node in the absence of data to transmit. Many studies address this problem and propose scheduling algorithms for polling the slave nodes such as, [112], [113], and [114]. Chakraborty et al. [115] proposed a solution for adaptive polling of slave nodes. In their method, the master node polls the slave based on the probabilistic scheduling estimation. This allows the node to reduce power consumption by extending its standby time. Also, in [116], the performance of different scheduling algorithms, such as pure round-robin, gated round-robin, and exhaustive round-robin for polling the slave nodes in BR/EDR have been evaluated using OPNET simulator. The second reason behind the high power consumption of BR/EDR is the scanning of a large number of channels (32 channels) for Device Discovery. For example, Duflot et al. [117] pointed out the issue and proposed a probabilistic model to scan the inquiry channels. They also analyzed the power consumption performance of Device Discovery in the best and worst case scenarios. In [118], the effect of Device Discovery complexity on power consumption has been analyzed. They proposed the adaptive rendezvous protocol as a method of optimizing Device Discovery performance. The lack of scalability and mesh networking are other weaknesses of BR/EDR. This version of Bluetooth only supports a maximum number of eight nodes, and slave nodes are not able to connect to each other directly because of the star-based topology. This standard has been primarily developed for the scenarios in which a computer plays a master node role, and a limited number of devices, such as a mouse, keyboard, and headset, are connected as slaves. Scatternet is one of the most highlighted solutions for performing mesh networking and improving the scalability of BR/EDR. Scatternet is a formation that is not natively supported by the core specification, but there is a huge amount of research that proposes scatternet-based solutions or improves on the scatternet formation. For example, Jedda et al. [119] mentioned the time efficiency problem in scatternet formation and proposed an algorithm to solve this challenge. They also compared the performance of other scatternet formation algorithms, such as BlueStars [120] and BlueMesh [121]. In [122], the problem with scatternet formation, specifically, was that the network overhead was caused by an increased number of bridges that were switching the piconets. This increases the probability of packet loss. Reference [123] analyzed the performance of algorithms for Bluetooth scatternet formation namely, BlueTrees [124], BlueStars and the BlueNet protocol [125], and revealed the problem of time-consuming Device Discovery in a scatternet network. In general, these works conclude that scatternet is not a reliable and robust solution for Bluetooth networking, specifically due to the discovery delay and routing challenges. B. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) BLE, introduced by SIG in 2011, was created for low-power wireless applications that did not require high throughput. To achieve low power consumption, the link layer, PHY layer, and packet formats were redesigned. In addition, while BR/EDR designed for only two-way communication, BLE devices are capable of acting only as either a transmitter or a receiver. For example, a remote control only needs to transmit a short command, and it does not need to receive a response. On the receiving side, a TV or lamp acts only as a receiver, waiting for a command to act. This results in design simplification, yielding higher power efficiency. In December 2013, SIG released the first update (v4.1) for the technology [126]. This update can be applied over the air, and no hardware change is required. In the first version of BLE, the devices were only able to establish a connection as master or slave. However, in the new update, the link layer is redesigned and allows devices to switch their roles when needed. One year later, SIG made noticeable changes and released version 4.2 [127]. In this new update, the actual payload size was increased from 27 Bytes to 251 Bytes. Increasing the payload size while keeping the same packet format increased the throughput up to 2.6 times more. This increase in the packet size also increased the feasibility of IPv6 support. Although version 4.2 does not support IPv6 in the core specifications, IETF published RFC (7668) [128] to provide IPv6 support over BLE with the adaptation of 6LoWPAN protocol stack. Bluetooth 5, introduced in December 2016, is the latest version of BLE [129]. Its main aim is to overcome the limitations of the older versions by increasing the range, size of advertisement payload, and throughput. The extension in range provides indoor application coverage and even enables building-to-building connectivity. In addition, advertisement extension was introduced in this version in order to increase the advertisement payload up to 8 times more by using data channels as secondary advertisement channels. This opened a new domain of applications for Bluetooth beacons. The last improvement was increasing the data rate by doubling the modulation rate, also called BLE high-speed mode. This mode helps lower power consumption because of the shorter radio operation time that is needed for transmitting the same amount of data. It also improves the coexistence of the technology with other devices through shorter occupancy of air time. An application of this mode is over-the-air-update of IoT devices. 1) Radio As Table 4 shows, the general transmit power range in BLE is between −10 dBm and 10 dBm. However, theoretically, version 5 supports output power up to 20 dBm. Similar to the classic version, the PHY layer in BLE operates in the 2.4 GHz frequency band. In contrast to BR/EDR, it has 40 channels, and each channel is 2 MHz wide. Among these channels, there are three special channels called advertisement channels. As shown in Figure 9(b), these channels are placed in the center frequency of 2402 MHz, 2426 MHz, and 2480 MHz and are specified with a gray color. The reason for choosing these frequency centers is to avoid the most common cause of interference in the 2.4 GHz, which is IEEE 802.11b/g/n. Since IEEE 802.11 b/g/n channels are 22 MHz wide, they overlap. Therefore, the conventional technique is to use only none-overlapping channels which are channel 1, 6, and 11. Thus, advertisement channels are strategically located in places that have minimum interference with non-overlapping channels in IEEE 802.11 b/g/n [130]. Advertisement channels are used for various purposes, such as Device Discovery, connection establishment, and broadcasting. In BR/EDR 32 channels are assigned for connection initiating which causes significant power consumption and delay. Where BLE reduced initiating links down to three advertisement channels that the receiving device needs to scan. By limiting the number of channels, connection establishment is faster and more power efficient compared to BR/EDR. Although both versions use the FHSS and AFH to cope with interference, only data channels are involved in frequency hopping in BLE. Data channels are channels that are reserved for information exchange. Please note that BLE 5 in advertisement extension mode uses data channels as secondary channels for advertisement. Before switching to data channels on the sender side, the device sends a special PDU in the advertisement channels and returns to sleep. In the receiver side, the device listens to these channels to pick up the PDU. Finally, GFSK modulation is used for radio transmission. The modulation rate is 1 Mbps, except in the BLE 5 high-speed which is 2 Mbps. 2) Link Layer Compared to BR/EDR, the new link layer has been simplified to reduce the power consumption and provides a faster connection establishment [131]. BLE has only a single packet type, instead of the 17 types of packets that are used in the BR/EDR. In particular, BR/EDR has a specific packet format for different modulations and file or voice transmission, on the other hand, BLE omitted the voice streaming capability and only has GFSK modulation. This simplifies the processing of resource-constrained devices. Connection establishment only requires scanning advertisement channels. Subsequently, based on the PDU format received, it either switches to data channels or receives the broadcast data [132]. Figure 12 shows the state machine of BLE, which has five states. Standby is the initial or default state. This state is designed to save power, and no sending or receiving happens in this state. The device may switch to this state from any other state. For example, after advertising device returns to standby mode to save power. Advertising is the first step for any BLE connection. In the link layer, advertisement channels are responsible for broadcasting PDUs. Based on the reason for advertising, these PDUs are classified as either: non-connectable advertising, connectable advertising, discoverable advertising, directed advertising, scan request, scan response, or connect request [133]. Advertising may result in communication establishment or merely broadcasting data. Figure 13(a) shows the process in the advertising state. During the Adv_Interval, devices send the same PDU in the advertisement channels (channels number 37, 38, and 39), return to the standby state for the duration of Adv_Delay, and then repeat the process. Scanning state is divided into two parts: passive scan and active scan. In the passive scan, the receiver only listens to the advertised packets and does not respond. In the active scan, the receiver may respond the received packet to get more information in order to make the connection. Initiating happens when the initiator receives the packet from the advertiser, and it responds to the packets by sending initiating packets. Connection is only required when the devices need to switch to data channels and exchange information. The advertising device becomes the master node, and the initiating device becomes a slave node. Then, the advertisement channels hand over the responsibility to the data channels by employing the AFH. After the connection ends, the device is only allowed to transition to the standby state. FIGURE 12. BLE link layer state has five states: Standby, Scanning, Advertising, Initiating, and Connection. Show All FIGURE 13. Advertisement and scanning process in BLE. (a) shows the advertising device, and (b) shows the process in a scanning device. Show All C. Bluetooth Beacon The idea of Bluetooth beacons was first introduced by Apple and named as iBeacon [134]. A Bluetooth beacon is equipped with BLE and was designed to be an simple one-way communication channel. Due to the low-power consumption of BLE, these beacons can operate for several years with a small battery. The concept of beaconing in Bluetooth refers to the periodical broadcasting of small pieces of information, such as sensor data or marketing information. Bluetooth beacons have applications in many areas, such as train stations, smart parking, and indoor positioning in order to help people by providing a platform directly to their smartphones. Currently, there are various types of BLE beacons are available in the market, such as Eddystone [135], which is developed by Google in 2015. Today, the availability of Bluetooth in smartphones allows people to interact with the technology easily. The maximum payload size for advertisement channels is 31 B. However, this is only enough to broadcast a short message with a limited number of characters. For example, in marketing applications, the packet size is not able to carry enough information to introduce the products. On the other hand, increasing the packet size creates other complications. For example, [136] shows that increasing the packet size in advertisement channels may result in significant interference in dense BLE environments. In Bluetooth 5, advertisement extension provided a solution to this problem. D. Bluetooth 5 Bluetooth 5 added new features to the previous versions. As shown in Figure 9, channel allocation in this version is the same as the older versions. However, the maximum transmit power increased from 10 dBm to 20 dBm. As mentioned earlier, the boldest enhancements in this update are an increase in range by employing Forward Error Correction (FEC), utilizing advertisement extension by using the data channels as secondary channels, and increasing the throughput by doubling the modulation rate [142]. We explain these features as follow. 1) BLE Coded and FEC One of the major issues in IoT devices is the range limitation, and Bluetooth-enabled devices are not an exception. Generally, common solutions for range extension are mesh networking and increasing transmission power. Mesh networking and IPv6 extend communication range by routing packets to reach their destination. This causes network traffic and consumes power from other nodes as well. On the other hand, increasing transmission power to achieve more extended point-to-point connectivity causes higher power consumption in the transmitter. To avoid these problems, the FEC feature is added to BLE. Typically, wireless propagation of waves (transitional region) is much longer than the connected region. In BLE connected region is where the acceptable Bit Error Rate (BER) in the receiver side is less than 10 −3 bits. For example, in Figure 14, node C can receive the signals from node A. However, due to path loss and interference, bits are corrupted, and data is not reliable. FIGURE 14. Connected region and transitional region in BLE 5 long range. Show All In FEC, several bits represent a single bit. If the receiver bits get corrupted, it can identify and recover these bits based on the pattern that represents each bit. Therefore, using a higher number of redundant bits makes it easier to recover the bit. There are two options available in version 5 for coding: S = 8 and S = 2. This means that it replaces a single bit with 8 and 2 bits, respectively. This feature increases the range up to 4 times and enables Bluetooth 5 to cover an entire house or extended outdoor area. Due to the extra bits added to the packet, the actual bit rate per second drops from 1 Mbps down to 125 kbps in S=8 and down to 500 kbps in S=2 [143]. It is important to note that due to the extra bits, the larger packet is more sensitive to interference due to the longer transmission time. 2) Advertisement Extension Since only three advertisement channels are available in BLE, an increase in the payload size will increase the traffic in these channels. Because of this, advertisement extension only uses the advertisement channels to address the next packet in data channels. To initiate this feature, the device sends the first packet, which includes the pointer to the channel that is randomly selected from the 37 data channels. The randomly selected channel is known as the secondary channel for advertisement. Figure 15 shows the packet format in advertisement channels and the data channels. The transmitted packet in the main advertisement channels has a maximum payload of 37 B; however, the secondary advertisement channels can carry up to 255 B in their payload. Furthermore, it is also possible to extend the payload by adding the next packet address and making a chain for data streaming applications. Before this, frequency hopping was only applied in the connection mode. Since the data channels are randomly selected as the secondary channels in advertisement extension, the receiver needs to know the channel number and time to listen. Therefore, the primary packet broadcasted by the advertisement channels must contain the hopping pattern. Marco et al. [144] performed a simulation experiment to evaluate the performance of service ratio, communication delay, and battery life, when advertisement extension is used. They claim that advertisement extension offers better performance compared to the connection-oriented and the basic advertisement in BLE concerning the factors above. However, they also pointed out the issues of higher losses, in comparison with connection mode, and latency, compared to the basic advertisement. FIGURE 15. BLE 4.2 and 5 (LE1M, LE2M) packet format. Show All 3) Bluetooth 5 2 Mbps In BLE 5 increasing the speed is an optional mode known as 2 Mbps version. This mode only operates on data channels and increases the throughput by doubling the modulation rate. One of the applications for this mode is upgrading the IoT device’s firmware over the air. In this case, higher speed helps saving energy by reducing the duty cycle, besides, shorter over the airtime minimizes the probability of the collision with other operating networks in the frequency band. Please note that BLE 5 maintained the 1 Mbps as the default mode to support backward compatibility with the older versions. Because every packet transmission requires a gap called Inter-frame Space (IFS) between packets and ACK to guarantee a successful transmission, the actual throughput in BLE is less than the modulation rate. In BLE IFS is defined as 150 μs for all the versions, but packet transmission and ACK periods vary based on the modulation rate. For example, as shown in Figure 16 although the packet size in v5 2 Mbps has one more octet, the transmit time is almost half of the v4.2 and v5 1 Mbps. This also explains the shorter period for ACK. Packet_Transmission_Time=(Packet_size×8)/Modulation_rate , however, in order to achieve the actual data rate only the payload of the packet has to be considered. Therefore, the actual throughput can be computed by Equation (1). Throughput= L payload T frame +IFS+ACK+IFS (1) View Source Where, Transmit_packet+IFS+ACK+IFS are in μs and Payload is in bits. From the Equation, it can be observed that the actual payload for v5 2 Mbps is (251×8)/(1064+150+40+150)=1.4Mbps . Consequently, v5 2 Mbps is 1.7 and 4.6 times faster than v5 1 Mbps/4.2 and 4.0/4.1 respectively. FIGURE 16. BLE packet transmission. Show All E. Bluetooth Mesh Draves et al. [148] showed the importance of mesh networking over WPAN. Although Qualcomm introduced a proprietary Bluetooth mesh known as CSRMesh [149], in the official Bluetooth mesh specification was later released by SIG in July 2017 [150]. Prior to this, Bluetooth suffered from shortcomings such as a single point of failure, limited network size, and range extension. Bluetooth mesh allows 3200 nodes to operate in a network. It enables a wide range of applications, such as in smart homes and industrial automation, where scalability is a major issue. The new software stack supports the BLE versions 4.0 through to 5. The more nodes joining the network, the more robust and reliable the network will be due to the nature of mesh networking and the ability to have multiple available paths for routing. Nodes in Bluetooth mesh are divided into several types. The first type is the low-power nodes that mostly rely on battery power [151]. They have the responsibility of transmitting or receiving information and going back to sleep for the defined period. Another type is called the friend nodes. They are mostly connected to the main power grid. Due to the lack of power limitation, they can perform more complex tasks. Friend nodes store the incoming message for low-power nodes. BLE shares the radio and link layer with Bluetooth mesh in order to adopt any BLE-enabled devices to work with mesh networking. F. Limitations of BLE Although BLE has many benefits, such as low-power consumption, beaconing, and availability in many devices, there are some issues associated with it. It still needs to rely on dual-mode devices and BR/EDR for audio streaming and bulky file transmission. There are studies in which researchers tried to implement audio transmission over BLE. Gentili et al. [152] introduced BlueVoice and examined the feasibility of voice transmission over BLE. They also mentioned the requirements, such as using 64.3 kbps bandwidth to transmit voice quality of 16 kHz. In their experiment, they measure the power consumption, memory, and processing requirements. Another limitation is the lack of seamless IPv6 connectivity in the core specification. This leads to a dependency of BLE on other networks like Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) or LTE to translate the Bluetooth packets to IP packets [131], [153], [154]. For example, a BLE-enabled smartwatch is unable to transmit heartbeat information directly to the Internet. It has to be done in two steps. First, this information has to be forwarded to a smartphone. Then, the smartphone converts the BLE packet to an IP packet to be routable over the Internet and transmits it via WLAN or LTE. SECTION V. Coexistence in 2.4 GHz Spectrum Wireless networks are susceptible to radio interference. The impact of interference becomes even more deteriorated if they operate in the same frequency band because it causes disruptive effects in the transmission [155]. Interference can cause packet loss, latency, jitter, false alarms, and synchronization errors [155]. All of these adverse effects, in particular, cause severe problems for mission-critical applications. As the 2.4 GHz band is unlicensed globally, many technologies use this band for their devices throughout the world, thereby, making the band more crowded. In 2003, the IEEE 802.15.2 task group [156] published standards for the coexistence of WPAN with other wireless networks. However, raising awareness of the new techniques and technologies do not solve the entire coexistence issue. The problem of coexistence among BR/EDR, BLE, IEEE 802.15.4, and IEEE 802.11 networks is causing major difficulties in terms of delay and power consumption in IoT networks. The issue of coexistence has gotten further momentum due to the fact the emerging standards like WirelessHART, ISA100.11a, and IEEE 802.15.4e share the same license-exempted ISM band, resulting in the 2.4 GHz frequency band being more crowded. Due to the massive proliferation of IEEE 802.15.4 and IEEE 802.11 networks, the possibility of interference would deteriorate application-specific QoS parameters. These networks exist in large numbers today and operate in close proximity to a number of application domains. Suitable interference avoidance solutions need to be adapted in order to maintain the required service. As presented in Figure 9 the different wireless technologies operating in the 2.4 GHz band. In Figure 9(a), BR/EDR is operating between 2402 MHz to 2480 MHz. It divides the frequency into 79 (1 MHz wide) channels and uses AFH to avoid collisions. Figure 9(b) shows BLE, which has 40 channels that are 2 MHz wide and also uses AFH. The only difference is that the advertising channels (specified with the gray color) have the responsibility of initiating the connection in connectable mode, and they are not involved in the frequency hopping. As mentioned in Table 4, to achieve longer coverage, the maximum transmit power in BLE 5 is increased from 10 dBm to 20 dBm, compared to the earlier version of BLE. Figure 9(c) shows channel assignment for the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. Channels from 1 to 10 for the 868 – 868.6 MHz and 902 – 928 MHz bands are defined for lower frequency ranges, whereas the channels from 11 to 26 are operating in 2.4 GHz band. Each channel is 2 MHz wide, and the center of each channel is 5 MHz apart. Figure 9(d) depicts the channel assignment of the IEEE 802.11b standard in the US. There are 11 channels, each 22 MHz wide. These channels overlap with each other, and in the best case scenario, we can only have three non-overlapping channels: channel 1, 6, and 11. However, the IEEE 802.11 standards have several versions, and the channel assignment differs in some countries. A. Coexistence of IEEE 802.15.4 and IEEE 802.11 IEEE 802.11, more widely known as WiFi, is the ubiquitous technology defining standards for WLANs. Today, WiFi devices are everywhere, and they are causing severe interference with IEEE 802.15.4 networks. Unlike IEEE 802.15.4 devices, IEEE 802.11 devices operate at a high transmit power, high data rate, and long range. Since they are unable to sense IEEE 802.15.4 devices, they create strong interference with them. In terms of channel bandwidth, both IEEE 802.15.4 and IEEE 802.11 channels are asymmetric, i.e., each IEEE 802.15.4 and IEEE 802.11 channel has bandwidth 5 MHz and 22 MHz, respectively. This causes overlapping of the four IEEE 802.15.4 channels, as shown in Figure 9. In most cases, IEEE 802.15.4 is vulnerable to interference [157], however, in certain cases, it does cause interference [158]. In order to improve network performance and support coexistence, these technologies inherently utilize specific techniques that help to promote coexistence. For example, IEEE 802.15.4 employs a number of inherent mechanisms such as DSSS, CSMA/CA, CCA, low transmit power, low duty cycle, channel alignment, ED, and LQI as explained in Section III. DSSS promotes coexistence and protects against interference by spreading the signal to a wider frequency through chipping code. Chipping code is achieved by mapping the bit pattern of the signal into a higher data rate bit sequence. As the signal is spread over a larger bandwidth, the narrowband interferer blocks a small overall percentage of the signal. The receiver is able to easily recover the signal [159]. CSMA/CA works on a “listen before talk” principle, where the transmitting devices PHY continuously samples the channel and notifies the receiving device when it is clear to transmit. In this way, it is less likely to cause collision and interference with other signals. The radio turnaround time for IEEE 802.15.4 is 192 μs , while the turnaround time of the DIFS (Distributed Interframe Space) of IEEE 802.11 is 50 μs . This can cause IEEE 802.11 devices to easily preempt the channel access while the IEEE 802.15.4 device is still in the process of radio state switching. Acknowledged transmission and retries further ensure reliability, where the receiver acknowledges a successful data reception. If the receiver does not send an ACK in a stipulated time, the sender assumes failure and retransmits data by using its retry limit. This can be particularly useful when the IEEE 802.15.4 device is encountering interference when coexisting with Bluetooth. Bluetooth may interfere with the first transmission, but then it would hop to another channel. A retry helps the IEEE 802.15.4 device to make a successful transmission on the second attempt. However, studies in [160] show that the timing mechanism employed in CCA mechanism of IEEE 802.15.4 is much longer than that of IEEE 802.11 b/g, and it causes IEEE 802.15.4 to be in an adverse situation in terms of channel access competition. IEEE 802.15.4e TSCH mode uses channel hopping to promote coexistence. Every transmission happens on a different channel. This helps to further counter the effects of interference from other co-located networks. Likewise, WirelessHART utilizes channel hopping in combination with channel blacklisting to deal with interference effectively. With this method, a channel that is continuously causing transmission problems is eliminated from the list of available channels. ISA100.11a employs adaptive frequency hopping using slow hopping, fast hopping, and a hybrid combination of both. Although these techniques avoid interference to some extent, the rising penetration of these networks in different domains prompts the need for more advanced and sound interference avoidance techniques in order to help these technologies coexist constructively. Especially for mission critical applications, the issue of interference in a coexisting environment becomes more challenging due to the real-time characteristics of these applications which always require bounded latency and high throughput. The issue of coexistence between IEEE 802.15.4 and IEEE 802.11a/b/g has been discussed in [157], [158], and [160]. For instance, in [160], it is shown how severely an IEEE 802.11 network can interfere with an IEEE 802.15.4 network and degrade its performance. This performance degradation can lead to adverse consequences for application QoS requirements. For example, consider a fire detection application based on IEEE 802.15.4. If there is a substantial packet loss due to massive IEEE 802.11 interference, the fire extinguisher may not trigger within the set latency bounds, leading to catastrophic consequences. Angrisani et al. [155] experimentally studied the coexistence of ZigBee and WLAN. The experiment was conducted by varying different characteristics, such as packet size, packet rate, and SINR, under different topologies. The authors confirmed that ZigBee and WLAN could coexist but to the detriment of packet loss rate and throughput. Guo et al. [161] conducted experimental tests to assess the interference from an IEEE 802.11 transmitter, Bluetooth transmitter, and microwave ovens sources on the link reliability of IEEE 802.15.4 devices. Through their results, the authors show that these interference sources (ISs) cause significant packet error rate (PER). The value of PER varies from 2% with no IS to an upward 25% depending upon the distance between receiver, transmitter, and IS. B. Coexistence of Bluetooth With Other Wireless Technologies After version 1.2, Bluetooth employed AFH with the pseudo-random FH technique. As random frequency hopping suffered from certain complications, such as repeating the transmission in busy channels. Pust and Burda [162] performed a comparison between the FH and AFH mathematical models and proved that AFH has a better performance in avoiding interference. The basic idea of AFH is to classify the channels as good or bad channels. Nodes are only allowed to transmit in good channels. To avoid interference, AFH restricts transmission on busy channels by labeling them as bad channels. Transmission in a good channel helps Bluetooth to establish a reliable connection and leave busy channels for other technologies. However, the number of channels should not be less than a specific number. Otherwise, the good channels would be more sensitive to interference. For example, in BR/EDR, the good channels can be reduced down to only 20 channels [163]. In AFH the device is not aware of the other devices and their transmission status. In order to identify the traffic condition in a channel for classification, there are two main methods: Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) and the Packet Error Rate (PER) [164]. Channel noise is one of the factors which has an impact on signal strength. In the RSSI technique, the receiver side measures the signal strength and informs the transmitter about the channel condition. On the other hand, in PER, the transmitter measures channel noise based on the number of lost packets. In order to update the channel map, the validity of classification needs to be checked periodically. Apart from all of the benefits of the AFH, there are also disadvantages to its use. For instance, in order to check the channel quality over time, AFH has to periodically scan and classify the channels, which increases the duty cycle. Moreover, reducing the number of available channels may cause more sensitivity to interference. Lee and Lee [165] simulated packet delivery ratio performance in BR/EDR by combining AFH and adaptive transmit power. They considered an environment with IEEE 802.11b and a number of BR/EDR piconets. They compared the proposed method with the basic AFH in term of interference mitigation in different distances. They showed that adaptively controlling the transmit power significantly decreases the PER. Another study in [166] analyzed the impact of interference of other sources on BLE and ZigBee. The authors monitored the power consumption of BLE and ZigBee and showed that BLE is more energy efficient in terms of the number of transmitted bytes per Joule. The study presented in [167] tested the performance of BLE. They analyzed the probability of BLE network failure in different environments and presence of interference. The results showed that, with the use of AFH, BLE has a lower probability of failure even in high interference. Bronzi et al. [168] presented the application of BLE for robust Inter-vehicular communications. They examined the impact of IEEE 802.11g on BLE. The experimental results showed that BLE can be a reliable solution when compared to IEEE 802.11p if the high data rate is not required. The performance of the advertisement channels in BLE was analyzed in [136]. Based on the experiment, in a dense environment, authors claimed that when multiple devices are scanning in the same channels, it is not feasible to increase packet size to above 31 bytes for the advertisement channel. C. Other Sources of Interference Microwave ovens use electromagnetic waves in the 2.4 GHz band. Although they are covered by a Faraday cage, there is still some leakage that occurs around the doors. These waves increase the motion in water molecules and heat up food [169]. According to the US Department of Energy (DOE), more than 90% of houses have microwave ovens [170]. They also share the same spectrum and cause interference for networking devices based on WLAN, Bluetooth, and IEEE 802.15.4. Microwave ovens normally generate 60 dBm signal power and operate in a different range in 2.4 GHz (model dependent). Results show that the radiation from microwave ovens that operate in the vicinity of WSN networks can cause up to 92% packet loss [171] in WSN. This increases further interference for wireless networking devices in the 2.4 GHz band. Kim et al. [160] investigated the coexistence of WLAN and ZigBee networks in the presence of microwave ovens. The experimental results show that the microwave oven is a dominant interferer and it significantly increases ZigBee’s PER. Rondeau et al. [172] analyzed the characteristics of microwave ovens and their effect on BR/EDR. The experimental results show that the AFH mechanism enables BR/EDR to be able to tolerate a high level of interference at a distance of one meter. Cordless phones are available almost everywhere. Most of them operate in the 2.4 GHz band like microwave ovens. They use DSSS or FHSS to overcome interference and achieve better voice quality. Generally, the DSSS method changes the channel manually, while the FHSS method automatically changes the channel. Similar to microwave ovens, the frequency range and the technique used in these devices are model dependent, and there is no global standard for them. SECTION VI. Z-wave Z-wave is a low-power wireless technology that is specifically designed for control applications in residential areas. It supports full mesh networking. The technology was developed by Zensys, which is a company for home automation applications such as Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC), Smart Lighting Control (SLC) and access control [173]. The main feature of the Z-wave technology is that it operates in the sub-1 GHz band, which allows the signal to avoid any interference with the 2.4 GHz working technologies. Moreover, it has the advantage of full interoperability with other z-wave enabled devices compared to other wireless technologies. This means regardless of product type, brand and manufacturer all Z-wave devices are able to join one network and help grow the mesh network. For example, a BLE enabled thermostat from one company might not connect to BLE smart sensor with other brand but in the Z-wave network, all the devices are cooperating with one another. The standard is proprietary and is available under a non-disclosure agreement. The point-to-point communication range between nodes is about 30 meters. The PHY layer in Z-wave is designed for remote control applications, where most of their requirements are just a single end-to-end message. For example, turning on and off a light requires a very low data rate. The technology operates in the 908.42 MHz band in the US and the 868.42 MHz band in Europe, employing the Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) modulation. By operating in this band, Z-wave avoids collision in 2.4 GHz frequency band. The radio has a data rate of up to 40 kbit/s [174]. In the MAC layer, Z-wave uses the CSMA/CA. The re-transmission technique is based on ACKs. There are two types of Z-wave devices: controller and slaves. The controller has the responsibility of initiating the control commands and sending them to other nodes. On the other hand, slave nodes are responsible for replying and executing the commands. It is also possible for the slave to forward the command to other nodes. A Z-wave network can support 232 nodes, including multiple controllers [175]. The controller node, which creates the Z-wave network, becomes the primary controller. There is only one central controller in a Z-wave network. The other controllers are the secondary controllers. Controllers can communicate with all the slaves. However, just the primary controller can add and remove the nodes from the network. Aside from the controller, there are some slave nodes in a Z-wave network that are only responsible for performing an action or routing the controller’s messages. SECTION VII. 802.11AH WLAN is a worldwide available technology. However, this technology suffers from a limited range and high power consumption, which are key elements in IoT. In October 2013, IEEE P802.11-TASK GROUP AH [176] provided the standard specification over WLAN to overcome these limitations. In the specification, MAC and PHY are inherited from IEEE 802.11ac. Additionally, sub-1 GHz frequency operation is added to provide better coverage, obstacle penetration, and lower power consumption. As explained in Section V, most of the wireless technologies opt for operating in the unlicensed 2.4 GHz band. This makes the frequency band more and more crowded. Operating in sub-1 GHz is an advantage for IEEE 802.11ah to avoid interferes in the 2.4 GHz frequency band. On the other hand, while technologies such as Bluetooth and ZigBee are targeting WPAN, IEEE 802.11ah aims for up to 1 km coverage to be used for applications in Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN). Adaptation of IEEE 802.11ah in smart homes, wearables, agriculture monitoring, animal tracking, industrial automation, and smart cities eliminates many existing wireless communication limitations. For example, a smartwatch can directly communicate with an IEEE 802.11ah Access Point (AP) to transmit the information without needing to connect to a smartphone, or a single AP in a smart building can manage all the connected devices. A. PHY Layer As discussed above, IEEE 802.11ah, like IEEE 802.11ac, employs Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) modulation in order to achieve high throughput and more extended coverage among low-power wireless networks. The difference between IEEE 802.11ac and IEEE 802.11ah is that the channel widths are ten times clocked down. Instead of 20, 40, 80, and 160 MHz in IEEE 802.11ac, IEEE 802.11ah uses 2, 4, 8, and 16 MHz in addition to an extra 1 MHz channel to extend the range. The 1 MHz and 2 MHz bandwidths are intended for applications that require low data rates and power, such as WSN. Furthermore, a new modulation and coding scheme, MCS10, has been designed for the 1 MHz channel. MCS10 is more reliable than the other modulation and coding schemes, and it can provide a coverage range up to 1 km. However, employing all the channels in different regions is not possible because of the licensing limitations. Table 5 shows the global available unlicensed bands in sub-1 GHz with Emitted Radiated Power (ERP) and Channel Bandwidth (CBW) [178]. TABLE 5 Worldwide Availability of IEEE 802.11ah Frequency Range [177] B. MAC Layer The IEEE 802.11ah MAC layer is designed to support scalability while keeping the power consumption low. Theoretically, the standard is able to support up to 6000 nodes. In order to support this amount of connected nodes to a single AP, IEEE 802.11ah uses the Restricted Access Window (RAW) mechanism. An AP defines RAW by first grouping the clients. The RAW is a time slot assigned to a group and the AP. The group is only allowed to communicate in that specified time slot window. In each group, nodes are competing for channel access. Up to 64 slots are supported [179]. In addition, IEEE 802.11ah introduced Target Wake Time (TWT) to save power. TWT assigns access time to the clients that need to wake up and access the channel. Clients and the AP exchange information about the channel access time and connection duration. SECTION VIII. LoRa LoRa is a radio frequency transmission method for wide area network applications. It was developed by Cycleo of Grenoble and acquired by Semtech [180]. It is a low-power and low data rate technology that covers up to 10 kilometers for wireless communication. It operates in the sub-1 GHz spectrum and follows the previously mentioned unlicensed band for every region in the world (see Table 5). The frequency band is divided into 8 or 15 channels, depending on the operation region. The transmission power is limited from 2 to 14 dBm in Europe and from 5 to 20 dBm in the U.S. LoRa has three bandwidth classes for communication: 125, 250, and 500 KHz. Although high bandwidth has the advantage of high data rate, it consumes more energy, reduces the communication range, and increases the possibility of interference due to operating in the broader spectrum. In LoRa, modulation is based on spread-spectrum techniques and a variation of Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS). In particular, it has the spreading factor (SF) of 7 to 12, which represents the number of bits encoded per symbol. The larger SF increases the transmission range in the expanse of higher power consumption. The CSS does not distinguish the noise in the channel like DSSS or AFH, but it has the advantage of using the entire allocated bandwidth, making it resistant to channel noise, Doppler effect, and multi-path fading. Normally, FSK modulations can only detect signals that are 8 to 10 dB above the noise floor, however, using CSS features enables the LoRa to detect signals that are 19.5 dB below the noise floor. Together with CSS LoRa uses FEC for error correction with the code rate of 4/5, 4/6, 4/7, and 4/8 to increase the robustness of the channel. More redundancy bits for error correction helps to extend the range and robustness of the link by recovering the corrupted bits that are caused by path loss or interference. However, the overhead consumes more energy. The LoRa network architecture uses the star-of-stars topology, which consists of end nodes and gateways. End nodes are usually battery powered devices and act as slave devices, while gateways are potent devices that are connected to AC power source and are responsible for collecting the data from the end nodes. In the LoRa network, several gateways can receive the information that is transmitted by the end node, and multiple receptions increase the reliability of the network. Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) is a layer on top of the LoRa that defines roles for communication introduced by the LoRa Alliance [181]. It is one of the most adopted, low-power wireless technologies for low data rate and long-range connectivity. It has advantages over cellular technologies, since cellular technologies are battery hungry and not suitable for low-power applications. For example, a soil moisture sensor in agricultural monitoring needs to sense the humidity level every few days, and the battery has to last for a few years. LoRaWAN extended the network functionality by adding a network server and defining different device classes for each application. The network server is responsible for managing the communication, filtering the multiple copies from one packet received by different gateways and scheduling the communication. For example, the network server decides the gateway that should communicate with certain end nodes and when to change the data rate. LoRaWAN has a bidirectional-employing adaptive data rate and transmission power. This adaptive control optimizes the power consumption and performance of the network. As presented in Figure 17 LoRaWAN has three device classes that are specified for each application. Class A is the default class and uses pure ALOHA to access the link for transmission. In this class, the end node wakes up periodically and transmits a packet. Then, it waits for the downlink to respond in the same channel and the same SF. If it does not receive the packet, it waits for the second packet in a different frequency and with different SF. After receiving a response from the gateway, the end node switches to sleep mode. On the gateway side, the device is only able to transmit information once, exactly after receiving the packet from the end node. Therefore, if the gateway needs to send more than one packet, it has to wait for hours or days to send the next packet in the queue. This class has the advantage of having the lowest power consumption due to the extended sleep period. Meanwhile, it is not suitable for real-time applications. This class is mostly used for non-critical sensors with long battery life requirements. Class B is designed for applications with more frequent connectivity requirements compared to class A. This class is a combination of class A and C. Devices in this class wake up whenever the gateways have information to transmit. A beacon that is transmitted by the gateway schedules the wake-up time for the end node. Frequent access ensures the connection establishment when it is required, however, the overhead due to the beacons and the frequent wake-up time reduces the battery life. Valves for irrigation are one of the examples of uses cases for devices in this class. Class C is normally implemented in devices that are connected to an AC power source, where energy consumption is not a concern. In this class, devices are continuously listening to the channel, except when they are transmitting information. Therefore, they are ideal for real-time applications. Devices such as street lights that are connected to the AC power are an example of this class and can act as gateways as well. FIGURE 17. LoRaWAN communication classes. Show All SECTION IX. Applications In this section, we present an overview of the important IoT applications in the home, healthcare, industry, and city domain. These applications utilize different wireless technologies and standards. First, we summarize the requirements of each application and their traffic characteristics. Second, we discuss the suitability of each wireless standard pertaining to each type of application. We critically point out the standards that are suitable for each application category. Additionally, we identify the drawbacks of each standard based on the requirements of the applications. A. Smart Building The basic goal of a smart building is to provide a better living environment in order to make our life more comfortable and more efficient while also making it safer and pleasant. It is reported that we spend more than 87% of our time in indoor environments, including home and commercial buildings [182]. In 2016, the global market for smart homes was valued at 39.93billionandpredictedtoreachupto 79.57 billion by 2022 with a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 11.3% [183]. However, the concept of the smart building is not only about controlling lights or other devices with voice commands or a simple point to point remote control. The main idea is to have an Ambient Intelligence (AmI) using M2M communication in order for a device in the building to make smart decisions based on real-time conditions [184]. According to Gartner, a typical family home will have 500 smart devices by 2022 [185]. This future requires a scalable wireless technology. As we discussed in Section V, with the increasing number of smart objects that communicate with each other using the same frequency band, interference becomes a severe issue. Furthermore, issues related to Internet connectivity, mobility, availability, energy consumption, and reliability need to be addressed. There are many consumer-oriented IoT smart home applications. Some of the major use cases and their communication requirements are discussed below. One of the common use cases in buildings is Smart Lighting Control that provides more comfort and convenience for the owners and has a direct impact on saving cost and energy. The Gartner’s report estimated that SLC cloud reduce the energy cost by 90%, and its market will grow from 46 million units in 2015 to 2.54 billion units in 2020 [187]. SLCs are performed by employing relays, motion sensors, daylight sensors, timers, dimmers, and switches. In order to perform efficient wireless controlling for this hardware, it requires mobility and scalability. For example, a large number of lamps or LEDs may exist and need to be accessible from different locations of the building. The mesh networking capability can support these to increase the coverage. A person who is moving in the building must be able to access the lights. Another key use case is the privacy and safety of the buildings. A typical solution for providing safety in buildings is the use of video surveillance. However, many users are reluctant to surveillance cameras because of privacy concerns, installation costs, lack of real-time responses, power consumption issues, and massive storage requirements. A better alternative to video surveillance is to use low-cost and low-power sensors that are able to detect and perform actions immediately and prevent disasters. For example, in the case of a fire in the building, smoke detectors can reliably prevent hazardous situations in a promptly manner. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning is the largest contributor to the energy bills in a home. It contributes to 48% of the total energy consumption of U.S. homes [188]. In many cases, the cost of power consumption changes based on the operation hours. Consequently, load balance controlling systems can help in scheduling the operation during off-peak periods [189]. The benefits of using smart HVAC are not only limited to providing comfort and a pleasant environment, but they also have direct impacts on people’s well-being. Smart controlling of HVAC requires employing smart thermostats, control valves, heating and cooling coils, dampers, actuators, pumps, fans, and vents. In order to access HVAC from anywhere, the timers, sensors, and actuators are required to be connected to the Internet and support scalability. Interoperability is desirable among sensors and actuators from different vendors in order to collaboratively communicate to make decisions. For example, a central heating or cooling system must be able to collect information about window shades, humidity, temperature, or absence of residents. Entertainment is one of the more compelling applications in smart buildings and homes that covers the access of multimedia contents such as music and home theaters. These applications require high throughput for streaming audio and video contents on the go. Since these devices rely on batteries, they require low-power consumption. Figure 18 shows the forecasting provided by ABI research for the future of wireless technologies in smart homes [190]. The numbers prove that technologies like WiFi and Bluetooth dual mode will have less share of the market, and low-power and low rate devices will be more desired. Table 6 summarizes the general requirements and shows the major technologies that support these requirements in smart buildings. A detailed discussion about smart building requirements is presented in [191]. TABLE 6 Smart Building Requirements and Available Technologies FIGURE 18. Comparison of major wireless technology demands for smart home predicted by 2018 (The CAGR is from 2016 to 2021) (source: [186]). Show All FIGURE 19. Comparison of major Bluetooth applications market predicted by 2021 (source: [203]). Show All FIGURE 20. Comparison of major applications based on the number of connected devices in smart cites (source: [250]). Show All BR/EDR and BLE are available technologies in almost every smartphone, laptop, and tablet. This feature enables smart buildings to be controlled using these devices. Statistics show that nearly 73% of people would like to receive smartphone alerts from their home security system [192]. Compared to other low-power technologies, this availability along with lower-power consumption are advantages for BLE. As shown in Figure 18, it can be predicted that the BLE market will surpass other technologies. BLE’s AFH algorithm and usage of advertising channels have reduced interference with most of the common operating wireless technologies in the 2.4 GHz band, such as IEEE 802.11. This feature makes BLE a suitable option for an environment that is full of wireless devices that operate in that band. The aforementioned features also help to reduce battery consumption and provide reliability. By increasing the range up to four times more in Bluetooth 5, the signals can cover an entire building. For example, the user is able to access the door lock from anywhere in the building. Another advantage of BLE is the recently added mesh networking feature, which increases the network scale, reliability, and coverage. Countless amounts of research has been done on Bluetooth applications in smart buildings [193]–[196]. For example, Putra et al. [197] compared the energy consumption of WiFi and BLE devices in smart home applications. The result showed the possibility of occupancy data transmission via BLE with 30% less battery consumption. Aside from academic publications on the application of BLE in smart buildings, there are some companies such as UniKey [198], BOLT [199], and Emerson [200] that are working on home automation devices based on Bluetooth. Beaconing is one of the unique features of BLE that is used in many applications, such as indoor positioning. For example, by tracking the users inside the building, the AmI can perform desired actions like turning on or off the lights or playing one’s favorite music [201]. As shown in the Figure 18, the Bluetooth beacon market will have the highest market compared to other Bluetooth-enabled technologies in 2021. While Bluetooth has its benefits, it does have some limitations that are associated with it. For example, there is a lack of scalability support in BR/EDR and IPv6 connectivity in both BLE and BR/EDR [202]. Incorporating other technologies with Bluetooth will increase the demand. ZigBee is another candidate for smart home applications. One of the major advantages of ZigBee is that as an open global wireless standard, it provides the open source software stack for developers to freely access the network and application layer. It employees mesh networking to eliminate the single point of failure and expand the reach of the network. Additionally, in the star topology in WLAN, sharing a single node between a large numbers of connected devices has the problem of increasing the delay in the entire network. The ZigBee network supports more than 400 connected nodes, which will be necessary for the future of smart homes, based on the Gartner report’s prediction. With mesh networking increasing the number of the devices, the robustness of the network is also increasing due to redundancy and decentralization [204]. A self-organizing network is optimal for a more scalable network architecture that incorporates reliability and adaptivity. ZigBee enables a variety of smart home applications by connecting the sensors and actuators. Additionally, ZigBee is a low-power wireless standard that allows the battery to operate for several years. It can also run without a battery by utilizing harvested energy. For example, a keychain flashlight gets its power by a simple push of a button. Internet connectivity is one of the significant characteristics of an ideal wireless network for home automation applications. Although ZigBee natively does not support Internet connectivity in the protocol stack, the 6LoWPAN technology adopted the IPv6 connectivity based on the 802.15.4 standard [47]. This adoption allows the nodes to be independent of the translation gateway in order to access the Internet. Compared to Bluetooth, the main limitations of ZigBee-based smart buildings are the lack of support by smartphones and the low communication throughput. Similar to Bluetooth, there is an ample amount of research that has been done on the application of ZigBee in smart buildings [205] [206]. Zigbee also has products on the market that are used for smart building applications. Companies such as Control4 [207] and Phillips Hue [208] are designing their products based on ZigBee technology. Thread is a recently developed wireless technology targeted for home automation. It is IPv6 enabled and supports mesh networking, thereby all devices can be addressed locally or globally. Mesh networking support allows the network to cover the entire building, and it improves the robustness of the network and avoids issues such as single point of failure. SLC is one of the main applications of a Thread network, and scalability is one of the requirements for the SLC applications. A Thread network supports up to 200 connected nodes. In addition, operating on MAC and PHY layers of IEEE 802.15.4 allows the technology to get the benefit of low-power consumption. In addition to Bluetooth and ZigBee, several proprietary standards target building automation applications. Standards such as Z-wave [209], INSTEON [210], and EnOcean are particularly designed to meet the requirements in home automation applications. Z-Wave specifically targets control applications such as SLC and access control. A thermostat is one of the examples of these applications and has over 2100 certified products. The products are supported by 600 companies like Intermatic [211], Hawking Technology [212], Wink [213], and Aeotec [214]. As previously mentioned in Section VI, Z-wave has the advantage of using the sub-1 GHz frequency band. However, this can also be a disadvantage when the products need to be distributed globally and used in other countries that have different rules for operating in the sub-1 GHz band. INSTEON Alliance was launched in 2005 by Smartlabs company [215]. The technology combined powerline and wireless mesh technology. Devices can support wireless technologies, wired technologies, or both. Wireless devices use FSK modulation and operate at 904 MHz with a data rate of 38.4 kb/s [216], [217]. INSTEON has applications in SLC, thermostats, smart sensors, and remote controls. EnOcean [218] is a wireless technology developed for smart homes and standardized by the international standard ISO/IEC 14543-3-10 [219]. It aims to use harvested power sources from the environment for wireless technology [220]. Devices such as smart plugs, SLC, and HVAC can be controlled by EnOcean. Like Z-wave and INSTEON, it operates in the sub-1 GHz band with a data rate of up to 125 kbps. B. Smart Healthcare Improving the health quality for individuals prompts a need to provide advanced systems for diagnosing, treating, and preventing diseases. A robust healthcare system can be divided into two generally classified categories: prevention of illness and post illness monitoring. Monitoring the blood pressure, Electrocardiogram (ECG), Electroencephalogram (EEG), Electromyogram (EMG), glucose level, cholesterol level, pulse oximetry, and toxins in the body can help early-stage detection in order to prevent fatal diseases, such as cancer or heart attacks [221]. The rapidly increasing population and longer life expectancies raise the importance of mechanisms for children and elderly health monitoring, artificial organ implementation and drug delivery. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), global life expectancy increased from 66.4 years in 2000 to 71.4 years in 2015 [222]. As the global life expectancy is increasing, the size of the geriatric population is also increasing. The number of people over 60 years old increased from 607 million to 901 million by a 48% increase. Also, it is predicted that by 2030, this number will grow by 56% to 1.4 billion and reach to 2.1 billion in 2050 [223]. It is also clear that the risk of chronic diseases like neurological conditions, diabetes, heart diseases, and strokes increase with age. The other concern is the cost of healthcare, which can include hospitalization, home nursing, and medicines. It is estimated that in the U.S., healthcare expenses are more than $2 trillion annually [224]. This leads to the need to provide an advanced healthcare system for diagnosing, treating, and preventing disease. The desired system must be inexpensive, accessible, harmless, reliable, and must not restrict the daily activities, mobility, or quality of life. IoT, in combination with medical engineering, has the great potential to provide this system through wirelessly monitoring and recording medical data. Providing the Internet connectivity allows the physician to monitor the health condition of the patients. Thus, 41% of the IoT is marketed for healthcare applications by 2025 [228]. There are a large number of researchers who are focusing on the cure, prevention, and prediction of diseases using IoT and wireless technologies [229]–[232]. In IoT-based healthcare systems, smart homes can replace hospitals, and bulky, attached-to-the-body monitoring systems can be changed to tiny, implanted sensors. Table 7 shows the QoS requirements for a wireless network, including the data rate, timeliness, acceptable error rate, and required battery life. TABLE 7 QoS Requirements for Smart Healthcare (Sources: [225]–[227]) It is important to provide a platform that does not limit the normal activities and quality of life of patients. For example, bulky attached sensors that are connected to wires are hard to carry and restrict the mobility of a patient [25]. Besides, providing Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) is important in monitoring health conditions. Smart homes or smart hospitals are examples of AAL. For instance, a smart home can receive the information from the wearable sensors of the patient in order to manage the temperature. Wireless sensors can be placed inside or outside of the body as wearables. These sensors can detect changes faster than highly equipped laboratories, especially for people who have a history of cancer or other diseases which can be inherited. However, this constant monitoring leads to high battery consumption. This increases the risk of nonavailability of these sensors in critical moments. Latency in bio-medical sensor applications is soft real time. Normally, in critical scenarios such as during a heart attack, a few seconds of latency is still acceptable. In [233], they implemented real-time and low-power ECG and EEG Bluetooth based sensors. They introduced the compressed sensing method, which saves the battery up to 37.1% more. In [234], the feasibility of applying dual mode Bluetooth in vital monitoring was analyzed. Authors implemented the ARM CPU based sensors, such as ECG, body temperature, and motion sensors. Reference [235] reviewed the available commercial Bluetooth-based healthcare devices in the market, which are composed of sensors such as activity tracking, ECG, EEG, EMG, and glucose monitoring. A BLE-based ECG monitoring using a smartphone is implemented in [236], and the result shows that power consumption is highly reduced. In addition to reducing power consumption, an equally important aspect of using sensors is that the patient is being continuously monitored in both indoor and outdoor locations like their home, hospital, and outside. Elderly patients are penitent when they feel that they are in danger and need to be continuously monitored. Reference [237] proposed a BLE-based indoor positioning system for patients who have Alzheimer. There are several commercial products like wearable devices on the market. Jawbone [238], Apple Watch [239], Samsung Gear [240] and most of the smartwatches are using Bluetooth and Wi-Fi technology to send the health sensor information. Heart rate monitoring with ECG, activity tracking, sleep monitoring, and other forms of health data are implemented in these wearables. However, Bluetooth is not the only low-power wireless technology for healthcare applications. ZigBee and 6LoWPAN are other candidates in this area. In [241] and [242], ZigBee-based ECG and pulse oximetry sensors are implemented by the authors, and the results showed that ZigBee meets the QoS requirements for these healthcare applications. Coexistence is also important in healthcare applications due to the WiFi-enabled smartphones that are operating close to the wireless technologies such as ZigBee. In [243], the impact of WiFi near the ZigBee wearables has been analyzed. Although 6LoWPAN and ZigBee share the same PHY and MAC, the IPv6 capability of 6LoWPAN makes the devices addressable via the Internet. This allows for the opportunity to remotely monitor health conditions or keep health records in the cloud. 6LoWPAN-based real-time health monitoring is proposed in [244]. They tested the performance of ECG monitoring sensor data for remote healthcare using a 6LoWPAN edge router. Doukas and Maglogiannis [245] presented the cloud platform in which sensors are connected to the Internet using 6LoWPAN technology. C. Industrial Automation During the last decade, wireless technology has been increasingly utilized in industries, leading to the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), where Industrial Wireless Sensor Networks (IWSNs) play a central role of behaving like a digital skin for the IoT. IWSNs can monitor critical parameters and control industrial processes and then inform the industrial personnel of this information promptly. IWSNs offer flexibility, self-organization, rapid deployment, and low-cost. They have the ability to make processes autonomous, resulting in the minimal human intervention [246] when compared to their wired counterpart. The shift from wired to the wireless networks dramatically helps to reduce huge capital expenditures of installation and maintenance of wires. Moreover, wired networks are rigid and fixed in nature. This makes it difficult to adapt to changes in industrial environments. In addition, certain industrial applications require mobile robots, which becomes a huge challenge with wired networks. However, wireless networks can easily support such mobility scenarios. Although IoT seems to revolutionize the industries, it is only if it satisfies the strict requirements and challenges that are put in place by the industrial applications. Such challenges include: extremely high reliability, low latency, robustness, fault tolerance, massive scalability, interoperability, and energy efficiency. Reliability against interference is highly indispensable because industries encompass several wireless networks, heavy machinery, and co-located communication systems that can interfere with IWSNs [246]. This can negatively impact wireless connectivity and result in link unreliability issues. Besides, most low-power wireless standards operate in the ISM band which can make them highly vulnerable to interference. Certain applications in industries, such as closed-loop control systems are extremely delaying sensitive. They tend to require low latency so that the control system can function smoothly. Furthermore, low power IWSNs have limited battery resources. When the devices run out of battery life and die, it leads to network failures. Therefore, the network needs to be fault tolerant so that failure of one device or a group of devices does not cause the entire network to fail. Scalability is also a challenge with wireless networks. The industries require dense networks that consist of hundreds and thousands of nodes. Efficient and fair distribution of limited resources in such dense networks causes trade-off complexities for several performance metrics. As time passes, certain devices and functionalities are removed, and new ones may be added. This requires the network to be scalable enough to accommodate such changes without compromising performance. Currently, wired networks are already prevalent in industries and used to support many processes and operations. The use of new wireless standards and solutions should seamlessly work with the legacy systems. This requires interoperability among the standards and solutions. Table 8 shows the different classes of industrial applications, ranging from process monitoring, control, safety, and emergency operations as defined by ISA [37]. The traffic categories are listed according to traffic priority with 0 as the highest priority traffic and 5 as the lowest priority traffic. Each application category generates a different kind of data traffic. In comparison to user-generated traffic on the Internet, the traffic generated by the industrial applications has different characteristics. TABLE 8 Different Classes of Industrial Applications as Defined by ISA Most of the processes in industries are periodic in nature, meaning that they do not require frequent data transmission. The long idle periods in between data transmission makes lower power networks more suitable in comparison to traditional cellular or next generation wireless networks. Essentially, the industrial environment is heterogeneous as shown in Table 9, i.e., certain traffic is an extremely high priority, while the other requires less priority. The high priority traffic requires immediate response to certain events, i.e., they need the right response at the right time, otherwise, the system can run into catastrophic situations. Below, we discuss some of the well-known low power standards and technologies developed over the years that promise to fulfill the requirements of industrial automation and help to realize IIoT. TABLE 9 Industrial Applications and Their Typical Requirements (Source: [18], [247]) 1) ZigBee ZigBee offers low power consumption. It supports several topologies that make it suitable for industrial monitoring and control. However, it is unable to provide high reliability and robustness [248]. ZigBee does not employ any frequency-agility protection against interference and fading effects. Moreover, the static nature of the channel will create a bottleneck for ZigBee communication if other wireless LANs operate in close proximity. This also impacts the delay and energy consumption because frequent packet losses will cause retransmissions, which will lead to an increase in delay and energy consumption. ZigBee uses IEEE 802.15.4 MAC, which renders the delay to be unbounded (cf Section III-C). This causes problems for real-time transmission, especially for control applications in process automation. 2) WirelessHART WirelessHART is developed to cater to monitoring and control in industries. It improves upon the drawbacks of ZigBee. The standard is robust and provides secure communication by implementing features such as channel hopping and channel blacklisting in order to avoid interference. In the case of transmission failures, retransmission occurs on a different channel. This improves reliability in harsh industrial environments. It supports mesh networking together with graph routing, which offers path redundancy and self-healing features that help in case of broken links [248]. The MAC protocol works on TDMA and provides multiple features, as discussed in Section 7. The standard employs a dedicated security manager, which implements the necessary encryption and security policies. Although WirelessHART is suitable in many aspects compared to ZigBee, it lacks public key encryption and the ability to connect to other networks without a gateway [249]. 3) IEEE 802.15.4E IEEE 802.15.4e defines six MAC modes. In particular, its TSCH MAC mode is important because it implements a deterministic TDMA mechanism and has channel hopping features in order to avoid the inevitable interference. The MAC protocol is multi-channel and offers many improvements as discussed in Section III-E3. Although TSCH offers high reliability for industrial automation, it lacks a scheduling entity to compute the schedule of nodes based on the traffic requirements of the application. TSCH defines the schedule, but how the schedule is built and maintained is unknown. Furthermore, 6TiSCH and 6LoWPAN standards emerged in order to provide an IP network that is capable of enabling low-power wireless standards as discussed in Section III-G and Section III-H, respectively. In this way, they promote interoperability among the latest and the traditional IP networks. D. Smart City The concept of a smart city envisions a city where information and communication technologies offer viable solutions to collect, analyze, and smartly distributes information in order to transform the services offered to the citizens, enhance operational efficiency, and help the public administration make better decisions [251], [252]. One of the promising projects for a smart city is the Smart Santander Project [50], conducted in the Spanish port city, Santander. It proposes a smart city where sensors, actuators, cameras, and screens are deployed around the city to help citizens better utilize information [253]. The smart city promises to manage and optimize the plethora of public services, such as monitoring structural health, air quality and noise, as well as traffic management, smart parking, managing city energy consumption, waste management, smart lighting, and the automation of public buildings [254]. This vision can be realized by utilizing the telecommunication infrastructure, as well as several technologies like as WSN, M2M, and Vehicular to Vehicular (V2V) communication. A smart city integrates several emerging technologies with existing information and communication infrastructure in order to exhibit the successful evolution of IoT. The environment is heterogeneous, i.e., it encompasses different types of devices and generates different types of data traffic. Such an environment vastly depends on the networking connectivity, which demands high reliability, availability, low latency, and, at the same time, satisfies the requirements of all levels of applications. The major barrier is the interoperability among the several heterogeneous technologies to be able to work together to achieve a common goal. In such a scenario, providing reliable connectivity is a huge challenge not only because of the coexistence of a large number of devices that comply with different technologies but also because these devices can face severe interference. In such scenarios, impaired network connectivity can result in catastrophic situations for the wide variety of offered services and applications. In looking at the requirements that are defined by the smart cities, low-power standards, such as ZigBee, Bluetooth, IEEE 802.11ah, NFC, and Z-Wave, can fulfill their demands, but they are unable to provide high throughput and extended transmission range [255]. Furthermore, the advanced technologies, such as 3GPP, WiMAX, LTE, and LTE-Advanced, are not suitable due to their high power consumption because most of the smart city applications require small sensors that will be deployed everywhere and run on batteries. In order to realize the smart city concepts, low-power standards have to promote interoperability. A massive number of devices will be installed and need to work together efficiently, so scalable protocols are necessary. SECTION X. Related Surveys There exist various survey papers that discuss the characteristics, technologies, standards, and applications of IoT [21], [256]–[259]. Unfortunately, these studies did not cover the recent wireless technologies and their suitability for each IoT application. In particular, a comprehensive study on MAC and PHY layers in these technologies is missing. A recent study in [257] focuses on exploring the network architectures of IoT. The authors discuss the classification of IoT architectures and outline future architectural requirements. However, the paper does not cover aspects such as low-power standardization or well-known infrastructure protocols for IoT. Another survey in [21] provides an excellent, holistic discussion of IoT with respect to its architecture, common standards, elements, technologies, infrastructure protocols, applications, and market opportunities. It is more of a general overview of the various aspects of IoT, however, it does not cover the in-depth technical details, pitfalls, and limitations of MAC protocols of low-power standards. The survey paper in [258] provides a sound analysis of recent advances in IoT. The authors focus the paper on the standardized protocol stack and examine the IETF standardization efforts and protocols. The paper provides a profound, technical discussion on the application, MAC, routing and transport layers, as well as low-power radio characteristics. However, it does not cover their applicability and limitations in different IoT application domains. The IoT survey paper in [256] examines the IETF current standards and protocols and explores open questions, limitations, opportunities, and future challenges. However, it discusses only the defacto standards. Besides, some surveys focus on a single IoT application and its requirements as well as the suitability of each wireless technology for it. For example, Yuehong et al. [229] explored the application of IoT in health care. The study provides a general overview of a system architecture for IoT-based smart health care. It is a general overview, and the specific requirements for applications are not mentioned. Similarly, Domingo [260] studied the research trend to improve the quality of life for individuals with disabilities. The study shows the possible solutions to overcome the limitations of some disabilities by using connected sensors and positioning technologies. The adaptability of optimal wireless technology for each scenario has been reviewed as well. The study lacks a larger pool of individuals and ignores the challenge of providing a low-power network. In [261] WBANs for medical and non-medical applications have been reviewed. The authors explained the uniqueness of this network because of the high mobility and placement of some sensors inside the human body. The scope of this is limited to the WBANs, and challenges, such as the coexistence of the wireless network, have not been taken into consideration. As was mentioned earlier, smart homes are another potential application of IoT. Alaa et al. [262] reviewed the research trend focusing on IoT-based smart homes. The study helps researchers to find out the challenges and demands of the desired smart homes. However, the study only classifies the number of researchers and directions and does not explain the technical specifications. The study in [204] only focuses on home automation. Raza et al. [263] reviewed the LPWAN for long-range communication networks such as SigFox and LoRaWAN. They explained the available technologies of these networks and applications. Due to the operation of LPWAN in the sub-1 GHz frequency and the requirement of having a different unlicensed band for every country, these technologies are not able to operate globally. In contrast with single application surveys, some other reviews only explain a single wireless technology. For instance, Gomez et al. [107] and Darroudi and Gomez [264] review the BLE standard from a protocol stack point of view and research to provide a BLE mesh network, respectively. On the other hand, surveys like [67], [265], and [266] only focus on IEEE 802.15.4 based standards. Blanckenstein et al. [267] reviewed low-power transceivers and suitability for each application. However, due to the novelty of technologies like BLE 5, they did not cover the latest transceivers. Additionally, the survey only reviews the hardware requirements for low-power networks. SECTION XI. Conclusion Emerging IoT applications impose several constraints in terms of reliability, timeliness, scalability, and energy efficiency. The purpose of our study was to provide a thorough discussion about existing low-power wireless standards, technologies, and protocols, and examine their suitability in diverse IoT application domains. We presented the requirements of different applications such as smart healthcare, industrial automation, and smart cities, and analyzed the potentials of existing standards in meeting such requirements. Our survey focused on the PHY and MAC layers because they directly influence the aforementioned constraints. In our attempt to explore their suitability, we highlighted several drawbacks of the MAC protocols. We also discussed the interference issue among the coexisting, low-power wireless networks, which is a major challenge that degrades the network performance for reliability and latency. We analyzed how the inherent schemes employed by the standards cope with the interference issues. Lastly, we presented the application domains of the IoT and the requirements for each scenario. Additionally, we introduced the optimal wireless solution for each application based on the demands. ACKNOWLEDGMENT (Ali Nikoukar and Saleem Raza contributed equally to this work.)

A systematic review of automated systems for real-time irrigation management

1. INTRODUCTION
The challenge of feeding a growing population with finite resources is becoming increasingly pressing. By 2050, the world population is expected to reach 9.7 billion, necessitating a 70% increase in food production (Falkenmark and Rockstrom, 2009). Irrigation plays a crucial role in enhancing crop yields and agricultural productivity to meet this growing demand. Studies have shown that irrigation can significantly increase crop water productivity, contributing to increased food production (Ali and Talukder, 2008; Playan and Mateos, 2005). However, water scarcity poses a significant challenge, with many regions facing water deficits and the need for improved water management practices (Falkenmark and Rockstrom, 2009). Optimizing irrigation schedules and doses based on crop requirements and environmental conditions is essential for maximizing yield and quality while minimizing water use (Zhang et al., 2024). The necessity of scalable water-efficient practices for increasing food demand cannot be overstated. Techniques such as regulated deficit irrigation, magnetically treated water, and the use of drought-tolerant crops like sorghum have shown promise in improving water productivity and ensuring food security (Mehmood et al., 2023; Putti et al., 2023; Hadebe et al., 2016). As the global food challenge intensifies, it is imperative to critically evaluate the current state and future potential of irrigation management systems to guide research, innovation, and implementation efforts towards fully autonomous, scalable solutions.

Despite the importance of irrigation in addressing the global food challenge, traditional irrigation management techniques, such as manual scheduling and timer-based systems, have significant limitations. These methods are often labor-intensive, inefficient, and less adaptable to changing conditions (Savin et al., 2023). Manual and timer-based scheduling can lead to high operational costs and inefficient water use (Raghavendra, Han, and Shin, 2023). The reliance on manual intervention and predetermined schedules limits their adaptability to changing environmental conditions, crop water requirements, and soil moisture levels (Kaptein et al., 2019). Sensor-based irrigation systems offer an alternative, enabling real-time adjustments based on soil water status measurements (Kaptein et al., 2019). However, the adoption of these systems in commercial settings has been limited, often requiring extensive input from researchers (Kim et al., 2014; Lea-Cox et al., 2018; Ristvey et al., 2018). The limitations of traditional irrigation management techniques highlight the need for scalable, automated solutions for greater efficiency in irrigation management. Automated systems that collect real-time data, analyze it, and make autonomous irrigation decisions can lead to improved water use efficiency and increased crop productivity (Champness et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2022). To fully understand the potential of automated systems, it is necessary to examine the automation of each part of the irrigation management pipeline and analyze the effectiveness and efficiency of integrated end-to-end solutions.

The emergence of smart irrigation management and IoT marks a significant shift from historical irrigation practices. Modern approaches rely on vast data and analysis algorithms, leveraging technologies such as remote sensing, sensor networks, weather data, and computational algorithms (Atanasov, 2023; Bellvert et al., 2023; Kumar et al., 2023). IoT plays a vital role in collecting vast amounts of data through sensors, data transmission, and tailored networks, enabling real-time monitoring and control of irrigation systems (Liakos, 2023; Zuckerman et al., 2024). These advancements in data collection and analysis have the potential to revolutionize irrigation management, allowing for more precise and efficient water use. However, challenges such as processing diverse data sources, data integration, and lack of integrated data analysis hamper the full benefit of IoT in irrigation management (Dave et al., 2023). The current fragmented approach in smart irrigation, focusing on individual components rather than the entire system, limits the potential for fully autonomous, real-time end-to-end irrigation management (Togneri et al., 2021). To address these challenges and fully realize the potential of smart irrigation management, there is a need for automating and integrating each section of the irrigation management pipeline, from sensor/weather data collection and transmission to processing, analysis, decision-making, and automated action (McKinion and Lemmon, 1985). This integration requires a thorough investigation of the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling seamless communication and compatibility between components within the automated irrigation management pipeline.

Machine learning (ML) plays a significant role in processing vast data, predicting plant stress, modeling climate effects, and optimizing irrigation in smart irrigation management systems. ML algorithms can analyze data collected from sensors and weather stations to determine optimal irrigation schedules (Vianny et al., 2022). However, the potential of ML is often constrained by manual steps, such as data interpretation, decision-making on irrigation timing and volume, and system adjustments. Automating ML integration to allow direct action from insights to irrigation execution, removing bottlenecks and achieving real-time adaptability, is crucial for fully autonomous irrigation management (Barzallo-Bertot et al., 2022). By integrating ML into automated systems, the irrigation management pipeline can become more seamless and efficient, enabling real-time decision-making and action based on data-driven insights. To achieve this level of automation and integration, it is essential to identify gaps and propose solutions for seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, aiming to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.

To achieve seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, interoperability and standardization are critical. Interoperability allows different system components, such as sensors, actuators, and software, to communicate and exchange data effectively, while standardization ensures that data is represented in a consistent format (Santos et al., 2020). Standardized protocols and data formats are essential for achieving seamless integration and ensuring compatibility between components in real-time irrigation management systems (Robles et al., 2022; Hatzivasilis et al., 2018). Existing and emerging standards, such as OGC SensorThings API and ISO 11783, have applicability to real-time irrigation management systems (Hazra et al., 2021). However, challenges such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security need to be addressed to fully realize the potential of interoperability and standardization in automated irrigation management systems (Hazra et al., 2021). Addressing these challenges is crucial for enabling the seamless integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline, which is essential for achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. A comprehensive evaluation of the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling the integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline is necessary to guide future research and implementation efforts.
The primary objective of this systematic review is to critically evaluate the current state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies for enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.

By addressing these objectives, this systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive and critical evaluation of the current state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems. Its intention is to guide future research, innovation, and implementation efforts to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management that can contribute to addressing the global food challenge.

3. DATA COLLECTION TO CLOUD: AUTOMATION AND REAL-TIME PROCESSING
3.1. Irrigation management data
The success of automated irrigation management systems relies heavily on the collection, transmission, and analysis of various types of data. The most applicable data types for irrigation management include soil moisture, canopy temperature, weather data, and plant physiological parameters (Farooq et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Olivier et al., 2021; Evett et al., 2020). These data are typically collected from a range of sources, including in-field sensors, remote sensing platforms, weather stations, and manual measurements (Li et al., 2019; Karimi et al., 2018).
Soil moisture data is arguably the most critical type of data for irrigation management, as it directly reflects the water available to plants and can be used to determine the optimal timing and amount of irrigation (Olivier et al., 2021; Intrigliolo & Castel, 2006). Soil moisture sensors, such as tensiometers, capacitance probes, and time-domain reflectometry (TDR) sensors, can provide real-time measurements of soil water content at various depths (Farooq et al., 2019). These sensors can be deployed in a network configuration to capture spatial variability in soil moisture across a field (Karimi et al., 2018).
Canopy temperature data is another valuable type of data for irrigation management, as it can be used to assess plant water stress and adjust irrigation accordingly (Evett et al., 2020). Infrared thermometers and thermal cameras can be used to measure canopy temperature, which is influenced by factors such as air temperature, humidity, wind speed, and plant water status (Li et al., 2019). When plants experience water stress, they tend to close their stomata to reduce water loss, leading to an increase in canopy temperature (Evett et al., 2020). By monitoring canopy temperature and comparing it to reference values, automated irrigation systems can detect plant water stress and trigger irrigation events to maintain optimal plant health and productivity (Li et al., 2019).
Weather data, including temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, and solar radiation, are essential for predicting crop water requirements and scheduling irrigation events (Akilan & Baalamurugan, 2024). Weather stations equipped with various sensors can provide real-time measurements of these parameters, which can be used as inputs for crop water requirement models, such as the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith equation (Li et al., 2019). These models estimate crop evapotranspiration (ET) based on weather data and crop-specific coefficients, allowing for the calculation of irrigation requirements (Intrigliolo & Castel, 2006). By integrating weather data into automated irrigation systems, irrigation schedules can be dynamically adjusted based on changing environmental conditions, ensuring that crops receive the optimal amount of water at the right time (Akilan & Baalamurugan, 2024).
When collecting and utilizing these data types, several considerations must be taken into account, including the volume, frequency, format, and source of the data (Farooq et al., 2019). The volume of data generated by automated irrigation systems can be substantial, especially when high-resolution sensors are deployed at a large scale (Bastidas Pacheco et al., 2022). This necessitates the use of efficient data storage, processing, and transmission technologies to handle the data load (Farooq et al., 2019). The frequency of data collection is another important consideration, as it directly impacts the temporal resolution of the data and the ability to detect rapid changes in plant water status or environmental conditions (Bastidas Pacheco et al., 2022). Bastidas Pacheco et al. (2022) demonstrated that collecting full pulse resolution data from water meters provides more accurate estimates of event occurrence, timing, and features compared to aggregated temporal resolutions, highlighting the importance of selecting appropriate data collection frequencies to ensure the quality and usefulness of the data for irrigation management.
The format of the data is also crucial, as it determines the compatibility and interoperability of the data with various analysis tools and platforms (Farooq et al., 2019). Standardized data formats, such as JSON, XML, or CSV, can facilitate data exchange and integration between different components of the automated irrigation system (Zhang et al., 2023). The source of the data is another important consideration, as it can impact the reliability, accuracy, and spatial coverage of the data (Farooq et al., 2019). For example, in-field sensors provide highly localized measurements, while remote sensing platforms, such as satellites or drones, can provide data at larger spatial scales (Li et al., 2019). By combining data from multiple sources, automated irrigation systems can achieve a more comprehensive understanding of crop water requirements and optimize irrigation management accordingly (Farooq et al., 2019).
Data quality, accuracy, and reliability are paramount in irrigation management, as they directly impact the effectiveness of decision-making processes and the efficiency of water use (Gupta et al., 2020). Inaccurate or unreliable data can lead to suboptimal irrigation decisions, resulting in crop stress, yield losses, or wasted water resources (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022). Gupta et al. (2020) emphasized the critical importance of data security and privacy in smart farming systems, as the leakage of sensitive agricultural data can cause severe economic losses to farmers and compromise the integrity of the automated irrigation system. The authors also highlighted the need for robust authentication and secure communication protocols to prevent unauthorized access to smart farming systems and protect data in transit (Gupta et al., 2020).
Ramli and Jabbar (2022) addressed the challenges associated with implementing real-time, automated irrigation systems, including data quality, scalability, reliability, and security. They proposed solutions and best practices based on the analysis of case studies and real-world implementations, such as the use of redundant sensors, data validation techniques, and secure communication protocols (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022). The authors also emphasized the importance of regular maintenance and calibration of sensors to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the collected data (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022).
Researchers have investigated the use of data compression, aggregation, and filtering techniques to reduce bandwidth requirements and improve transmission efficiency in automated irrigation systems (Karim et al., 2023; Rady et al., 2020; Cui, 2023). Karim et al. (2023) explored the effectiveness of various data compression techniques, such as lossless and lossy compression algorithms, in reducing the size of data packets transmitted over wireless networks. The authors found that lossless compression techniques, such as Huffman coding and Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW), can significantly reduce data size without compromising data quality, while lossy compression techniques, such as JPEG and MP3, can further reduce data size by introducing acceptable levels of distortion (Karim et al., 2023).
Rady et al. (2020) developed a novel data compression algorithm specifically designed for irrigation data, which achieved significant compression ratios without compromising data quality. The authors demonstrated that their algorithm could reduce the amount of data transmitted over wireless networks, thereby improving the efficiency of the irrigation system and reducing costs (Rady et al., 2020). Cui (2023) investigated the use of data aggregation and filtering techniques to reduce the number of transmissions and save bandwidth in automated irrigation systems. The author proposed a data aggregation scheme that combines multiple sensor readings into a single value, such as the average soil moisture over a specified time interval, to reduce the frequency of data transmissions (Cui, 2023). Additionally, the author explored the use of data filtering techniques, such as Kalman filters and particle filters, to remove noise and outliers from sensor data, improving the accuracy and reliability of the transmitted information (Cui, 2023).
Data standardization and harmonization are crucial for facilitating seamless integration and interoperability between the various components of automated irrigation management systems (Zhang et al., 2023; Ermoliev et al., 2022). Zhang et al. (2023) developed a novel cyberinformatics technology called iCrop, which enables the in-season monitoring of crop-specific land cover across the contiguous United States. The authors highlighted the importance of data standardization and harmonization in the context of iCrop, as it allows for the efficient distribution of crop-specific land cover information based on the findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data principle (Zhang et al., 2023). By adopting standardized data formats and protocols, such as the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards, iCrop enables the seamless integration of various data sources and facilitates the interoperability of the system with other agricultural decision support tools (Zhang et al., 2023).
Ermoliev et al. (2022) proposed a linkage methodology for linking distributed sectoral/regional optimization models in a situation where private information is not available or cannot be shared by modeling teams. The authors emphasized the need for data standardization to enable decentralized cross-sectoral coordination and analysis, as it allows for the consistent representation and exchange of data between different models and stakeholders (Ermoliev et al., 2022). By adopting standardized data formats and interfaces, the proposed linkage methodology can facilitate the integration of various optimization models and support the development of comprehensive decision support systems for sustainable resource management (Ermoliev et al., 2022).
Metadata plays a vital role in providing context and enabling better data interpretation and decision-making in automated irrigation management systems (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021). Metadata refers to the additional information that describes the characteristics, quality, and context of the primary data, such as the sensor type, calibration parameters, measurement units, and timestamp (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021). Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al. (2021) highlighted the importance of metadata in water resources management, as it enables decision-makers to use the data to the best of its capabilities by understanding factors such as when water data was collected and what factors might have contributed to the measurements. The authors emphasized the need for standardized metadata formats and guidelines, such as the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) and the ISO 19115 standard, to ensure the consistency and interoperability of metadata across different water information systems (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021).
In the context of automated irrigation management systems, metadata can provide valuable information about the data collection process, sensor performance, and environmental conditions that can aid in data interpretation and decision-making (Cota & Mamede, 2023). For example, metadata about the sensor type and calibration parameters can help assess the accuracy and reliability of the collected data, while metadata about the weather conditions and soil properties can provide context for interpreting the data and adjusting irrigation strategies accordingly (Cota & Mamede, 2023). By incorporating metadata into the data management and analysis pipeline of automated irrigation systems, decision-makers can make more informed and context-aware decisions, leading to improved water use efficiency and crop productivity (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021).

3.2. Edge Computing and Fog Computing
Edge computing and fog computing have emerged as transformative technologies in the realm of real-time irrigation management systems, offering significant potential for improving efficiency, scalability, and reliability (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2019). Edge computing refers to the practice of processing data near the edge of the network, close to the source of the data, while fog computing is a decentralized computing infrastructure that extends cloud computing capabilities to the network edge (Hassija et al., 2019). These technologies bring computation and analytics closer to the data source, reducing the need for data to travel to the cloud and enabling faster processing and decision-making (Hassija et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020).
The potential of edge computing and fog computing in real-time irrigation management is immense. Abdel Nasser et al. (2020) proposed a two-layer system for water demand prediction using automated meters and machine learning techniques, demonstrating the potential of edge computing in improving the efficiency and scalability of irrigation management. The system collects and aggregates data from distributed smart meters in the first layer, while the second layer uses LSTM neural networks to predict water demand for different regions of households. By leveraging edge computing, the system can achieve high accuracy in predicting water demand, which is essential for efficient irrigation management (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020).
Tran et al. (2019) conducted a comprehensive review of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems, highlighting the role of fog computing in addressing data transmission challenges and enabling seamless integration across the irrigation management pipeline. The authors emphasize that real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems have the potential to significantly improve water efficiency, crop yields, and reduce labor costs. However, they also identify several challenges that need to be addressed, such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security, which can be effectively tackled by implementing fog computing architectures (Tran et al., 2019).
Edge computing offers several benefits in real-time irrigation management systems, including reduced latency, real-time decision-making, and reduced reliance on cloud connectivity (Mishra, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). By processing data closer to the source, edge computing enables faster response times and more efficient data handling (Mishra, 2020). Mishra (2020) highlights that edge computing reduces latency by processing data closer to the source, enabling real-time decision-making and lessening reliance on cloud connectivity by shifting processing to local or edge devices.
Zhang et al. (2020) explore the application of edge computing in agricultural settings, demonstrating its potential to improve the efficiency and accuracy of irrigation systems. The authors discuss how edge computing has prospects in various agricultural applications, such as pest identification, safety traceability of agricultural products, unmanned agricultural machinery, agricultural technology promotion, and intelligent management. They also emphasize that the emergence of edge computing models, such as fog computing, cloudlet, and mobile edge computing, has transformed the management and operation of farms (Zhang et al., 2020).
Fog computing plays a crucial role in distributing processing and storage across the network, enhancing the scalability and reliability of automated irrigation systems (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022; Singh et al., 2022). Premkumar and Sigappi (2022) evaluate the current state of automated irrigation management systems and propose a hybrid machine learning approach for predicting soil moisture and managing irrigation. Their study emphasizes the potential of fog computing in distributing processing and storage across the network, improving the efficiency and scalability of irrigation systems. The proposed hybrid machine learning approach outperforms other machine learning algorithms in predicting soil moisture, demonstrating the effectiveness of fog computing in enhancing the performance of automated irrigation systems (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022).
Singh et al. (2022) discuss the role of fog computing in distributing processing and storage across the network, enhancing scalability and reliability in agricultural management systems. The authors argue that by implementing fog computing, these systems can achieve faster data processing and response times, improving overall efficiency and effectiveness. They also highlight that fog computing can address the challenges faced by real-time data transmission in agricultural management systems, such as latency, bandwidth limitations, and data security (Singh et al., 2022).
The integration of edge and fog computing in real-time irrigation management systems is crucial for achieving fully automated, scalable, and reliable solutions. As the demand for autonomous irrigation management grows, these technologies will play a pivotal role in enabling faster decision-making, reduced latency, improved resource utilization, and seamless integration across the irrigation management pipeline (Tran et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020). By bringing computation and analytics closer to the data source and distributing processing and storage across the network, edge and fog computing can significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of automated irrigation systems, contributing to the overall goal of addressing the global food challenge through optimized water resource management and increased agricultural productivity (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022; Singh et al., 2022).

3.3. Automation of Data Collection
The automation of data collection is a critical component in the development of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies. It enables the efficient gathering of vital information about crop health, environmental conditions, and water requirements, which is essential for enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity. Two key aspects of automated data collection are the use of advanced sensing technologies for non-invasive plant stress detection and the implementation of wireless sensor networks and energy-efficient communication protocols for large-scale, long-term data collection.
Advanced sensing technologies, such as hyperspectral imaging and thermal sensing, have emerged as powerful tools for non-invasive plant stress detection in automated irrigation management systems. These technologies provide valuable information about crop traits, enabling early and accurate detection of plant health issues (Triantafyllou et al., 2019). Triantafyllou et al. (2019) propose a comprehensive reference architecture model that incorporates advanced sensing technologies in the sensor layer for real-time plant stress detection, highlighting their importance in providing non-invasive plant stress detection. Similarly, Hossain et al. (2023) present a novel IoT-ML-Blockchain integrated framework for smart agricultural management that leverages advanced sensing technologies to optimize water use and improve crop yield, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
Hyperspectral imaging can capture subtle changes in plant physiology that are indicative of stress, while machine learning algorithms can be employed to extract meaningful patterns from the spectral data and classify different stress types (Araus et al., 2014). Thermal sensing can detect changes in canopy temperature, which is influenced by factors such as plant water status (Li et al., 2019). By monitoring canopy temperature and comparing it to reference values, automated irrigation systems can detect plant water stress and trigger irrigation events to maintain optimal plant health and productivity (Li et al., 2019).
The integration of advanced sensing technologies in automated irrigation management systems has the potential to revolutionize precision agriculture. Jiang et al. (2019) demonstrate the effectiveness of a deep learning-based model in accurately detecting leaf spot diseases, highlighting the importance of image augmentation and deep learning algorithms in enhancing the model's performance.
Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and energy-efficient communication protocols have the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and reliability of data collection in large-scale, long-term irrigation systems. WSNs offer a cost-effective and scalable solution for real-time data collection in large-scale irrigation systems, providing remote monitoring and automated control capabilities (Mehdizadeh et al., 2020). Nishiura and Yamamoto (2021) propose a novel sensor network system that utilizes drones and wireless power transfer to autonomously collect environmental data from sensor nodes in vast agricultural fields, reducing operational costs and enhancing the efficiency of data collection. Similarly, Higashiura and Yamamoto (2021) introduce a network system that employs UAVs and LoRa communication to efficiently collect environmental data from sensor nodes distributed across large farmlands, optimizing data collection and reducing travel distance and time.
Energy-efficient communication protocols are crucial for ensuring reliable data transmission in challenging environmental conditions and extending the lifespan of sensor nodes (Mehdizadeh et al., 2020). Al-Ali et al. (2023) investigate the potential of WSNs and energy-efficient communication protocols for data collection in large-scale, long-term irrigation systems, discussing the challenges and opportunities of using these technologies to improve the efficiency and reliability of real-time data collection in irrigation management. Mehdizadeh et al. (2020) emphasize the need for careful consideration of factors such as data accuracy, energy consumption, and network reliability when designing effective WSNs for irrigation management, enabling timely irrigation decisions and improved crop yields.
The automation of data collection through the use of advanced sensing technologies and wireless sensor networks is essential for achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. By enabling non-invasive plant stress detection and large-scale, long-term data collection, these technologies contribute to the overall goal of optimizing water resource management and increasing agricultural productivity. The integration of these technologies in real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems has the potential to enhance agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity, ultimately contributing to the development of fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management solutions.

3.4: Real-Time Data Transmission Protocols and Technologies
Real-time data transmission is a critical component of automated irrigation management systems, as it enables the timely delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of suitable protocols and network architectures is essential for ensuring efficient and reliable data transmission in these systems, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
The Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol has emerged as a popular choice for real-time data transmission in IoT networks, including those used for automated irrigation management. MQTT is a lightweight, publish-subscribe protocol designed for constrained devices and low-bandwidth networks (Author, 2019). Its simplicity and low overhead make it well-suited for IoT applications where data transmission speed and energy efficiency are critical (Saranyadevi et al., 2022). MQTT provides three Quality of Service (QoS) levels, ensuring data reliability in real-time scenarios (Author, 2019). Chen et al. (2020) proposed novel algorithms to improve data exchange efficiency and handle rerouting in MQTT-based IoT networks for automated irrigation management systems. Their TBRouting algorithm efficiently finds the shortest paths for data transmission, while the Rerouting algorithm effectively handles the rerouting of topic-based session flows when a broker crashes. The combination of these algorithms can significantly improve the performance and reliability of automated irrigation management systems (Chen et al., 2020).
Client-server IoT networks, such as those based on MQTT, play a crucial role in real-time data transmission for automated irrigation management systems. In these networks, sensors and devices (clients) publish data to a central broker (server), which then distributes the data to subscribed clients (Verma et al., 2021). This architecture enables efficient data collection, processing, and dissemination, facilitating the integration of various components within the automated irrigation management pipeline. Verma et al. (2021) proposed an architecture for healthcare monitoring systems using IoT and communication protocols, which provides a comprehensive overview of existing approaches and highlights challenges and opportunities in the field. Although focused on healthcare, the insights from this study can be applied to automated irrigation management systems, emphasizing the importance of interoperability and standardization for seamless integration (Verma et al., 2021).
In addition to MQTT, other application layer protocols such as XMPP, CoAP, SOAP, and HTTP have been explored for real-time data transmission in IoT networks. Each protocol has its strengths and weaknesses, making them suitable for different applications and scenarios. XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) is an open-standard protocol that supports real-time messaging, presence, and request-response services (Saint-Andre, 2011). CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) is a specialized web transfer protocol designed for use with constrained nodes and networks in the Internet of Things (Shelby et al., 2014). SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services, while HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web (Fielding et al., 1999).
Motamedi and Villányi (2022) compared and evaluated wireless communication protocols for the implementation of smart irrigation systems in greenhouses, considering factors such as power consumption, range, reliability, and scalability. They found that ZigBee is the most suitable local communication protocol for greenhouse irrigation due to its large number of nodes and long range, while MQTT is the recommended messaging protocol for smart irrigation systems due to its TCP transport protocol and quality of service (QoS) options. GSM is a reliable and cost-effective global communication protocol for greenhouse irrigation, providing wide coverage and low cost (Motamedi & Villányi, 2022).
Syafarinda et al. (2018) investigated the use of the MQTT protocol in a precision agriculture system using a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). They found that MQTT is suitable for use in IoT applications due to its lightweight, simple, and low bandwidth requirements. The average data transmission speed using the MQTT protocol was approximately 1 second, demonstrating its effectiveness for real-time data transmission in precision agriculture systems (Syafarinda et al., 2018).
The choice of application layer protocol for real-time irrigation management depends on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. MQTT and RTPS (Real-Time Publish-Subscribe) are both suitable for real-time data transmission in IoT systems, but they have different strengths and weaknesses. MQTT is a better choice for applications that require low latency and high throughput, while RTPS is a better choice for applications that require high reliability and low latency (Sanchez-Iborra & Skarmeta, 2021). The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of various application layer protocols, provides valuable insights into the suitability of these technologies for real-time data transmission in automated irrigation management systems.
In summary, real-time data transmission protocols and technologies play a vital role in the automation of irrigation management systems, enabling the efficient and reliable delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of application layer protocols, highlights the importance of selecting suitable technologies based on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. By leveraging these technologies, automated irrigation management systems can achieve seamless integration and contribute to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.

3.5. Challenges and Solutions in Real-Time Data Transmission
Following the exploration of data collection, processing at the edge and fog, and automation in previous sections, we now turn to the critical aspect of real-time data transmission. While essential for automated irrigation management, this stage presents unique challenges that must be addressed to ensure system efficiency and reliability.
Obstacles in Real-Time Data Transmission
Agricultural environments present unique challenges for real-time data transmission, directly impacting the effectiveness of automated irrigation systems. Environmental factors can significantly disrupt wireless communication. Adverse weather conditions such as heavy rain, fog, and high winds can weaken or even block radio signals, leading to data loss and compromised system performance. Physical obstacles like trees, buildings, and uneven terrain further complicate signal propagation, creating reliability issues (Jukan et al., 2017; Yi & Ji, 2014; Zhang, Chang & Baoguo, 2018). These environmental challenges necessitate robust communication protocols and network architectures that can ensure consistent and reliable data flow.
In addition to environmental factors, technical limitations also present significant obstacles. Large-scale agricultural operations often demand long-distance data transmission, which can be hindered by the limited range of certain wireless communication protocols. Network congestion, occurring when multiple sensors transmit data concurrently, can lead to delays and potential data loss, further complicating real-time decision-making (Hameed et al., 2020). To mitigate these issues, researchers have investigated the potential of cognitive radio networks (CRNs) and dynamic spectrum access (DSA) for optimizing spectrum utilization and reducing interference (Righi et al., 2017; Shafi et al., 2018; Trigka & Dritsas, 2022). CRNs enable devices to intelligently sense and adapt to the surrounding radio environment, dynamically adjusting transmission parameters to avoid interference and improve communication efficiency. DSA, on the other hand, facilitates the dynamic allocation of unused spectrum, enhancing spectrum utilization and reducing congestion.
Furthermore, data security and privacy are paramount concerns in real-time irrigation systems. The sensitive nature of agricultural data, such as crop yields and farm management practices, necessitates robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches (Gupta et al., 2020). Implementing secure communication protocols, authentication mechanisms, and encryption techniques is essential to protect data integrity and ensure the trustworthiness of the system.
Investigating Data Optimization Techniques
To enhance the efficiency and reliability of real-time data transmission in automated irrigation systems, researchers have explored a range of data optimization techniques. Data compression techniques aim to reduce the size of data packets transmitted over the network, minimizing bandwidth requirements and improving transmission speed (Rady et al., 2020; Karim et al., 2023). Lossless compression algorithms, such as Huffman coding and LZW, preserve data integrity while effectively reducing data size, ensuring that no information is lost during transmission (Cui, 2023). Lossy compression algorithms, such as JPEG and MP3, offer higher compression ratios but introduce a controlled level of data loss, which may be acceptable for certain applications where some loss of precision is tolerable (Karim et al., 2023). The choice between lossless and lossy compression depends on the specific application and the trade-off between data size and accuracy.
Data aggregation techniques provide another effective approach to optimize data transmission. By aggregating multiple sensor readings into a single representative value, such as average soil moisture or temperature, the number of transmissions can be significantly reduced, conserving bandwidth and energy resources (Cui, 2023). This is particularly beneficial in large-scale irrigation systems where numerous sensors are deployed across vast areas, generating substantial amounts of data. Additionally, data filtering techniques play a crucial role in improving data quality and reliability. Kalman filters and particle filters can effectively remove noise and outliers from sensor data, ensuring that only accurate and relevant information is transmitted and used for decision-making (Cui, 2023). This is essential for preventing erroneous data from influencing irrigation decisions and potentially leading to suboptimal water management.
Sensor calibration, drift correction, and fault detection are essential for maintaining data accuracy and reliability (Dos Santos et al., 2023). Regular calibration ensures that sensors provide accurate measurements over time, while drift correction techniques account for gradual changes in sensor readings due to environmental factors or aging. Fault detection mechanisms can identify and address sensor malfunctions or anomalies, preventing erroneous data from influencing irrigation decisions and potentially harming crops or wasting water.
Addressing the Challenges
Effectively addressing the challenges in real-time data transmission requires a multifaceted approach that encompasses environmental, technical, and data-related considerations. Implementing robust and adaptive communication protocols is crucial for overcoming interference and signal degradation caused by weather conditions and physical obstacles. Selecting appropriate protocols, such as LoRa or ZigBee, with suitable range and penetration capabilities can ensure reliable data transmission in challenging agricultural environments (Motamedi & Villányi, 2022). Additionally, employing techniques like frequency hopping and error correction codes can further improve communication resilience and mitigate data loss.
Optimizing network architecture is another key consideration. Deploying a distributed network architecture with edge and fog computing capabilities can significantly enhance data processing and transmission efficiency (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2019). Edge devices can perform initial data processing and aggregation tasks, reducing the amount of data transmitted to the cloud and minimizing latency, while fog nodes can provide additional processing power and storage closer to the data source, enhancing scalability and reliability. This distributed approach alleviates the burden on the central cloud server and allows for more responsive and efficient irrigation management.
Data optimization techniques play a vital role in reducing bandwidth requirements and improving transmission efficiency. The choice of data compression, aggregation, and filtering techniques should be tailored to the specific requirements of the irrigation system, considering factors such as data type, accuracy needs, and available bandwidth. By carefully selecting and implementing these techniques, the overall performance and effectiveness of real-time irrigation systems can be significantly enhanced, leading to more sustainable water management practices and improved agricultural productivity.
By addressing these challenges and implementing appropriate solutions, real-time data transmission can become a reliable and efficient component of automated irrigation systems, contributing to the overall goal of achieving sustainable and productive agriculture in the face of growing food demands and water scarcity.

3.6. IoT Network Architectures and Variable Rate Irrigation (VRI) for Real-Time Irrigation
Real-time irrigation management systems heavily rely on the efficient and reliable transmission of data from sensors and weather stations to the cloud for processing and decision-making. However, agricultural environments present unique challenges to wireless communication, including adverse weather conditions, physical obstacles, and the limitations of wireless technologies. These challenges necessitate robust and adaptive solutions to ensure the consistent and timely flow of data, enabling truly autonomous irrigation scheduling.
Environmental factors, such as heavy rain, fog, and strong winds, can significantly disrupt wireless communication by attenuating or even blocking radio signals, leading to data loss and compromised system performance (Ed-daoudi et al., 2023; Jukan et al., 2017; Yi & Ji, 2014; Zhang, Chang & Baoguo, 2018). Dense vegetation, buildings, and uneven terrain create further complications by causing multipath propagation and shadowing effects (Yim et al., 2018; Gautam and Pagay, 2020). The study by Yim et al. (2018) on LoRa networks in a tree farm environment exemplifies these challenges, revealing reduced communication range and data reliability compared to theoretical expectations. This underscores the need for carefully selecting and optimizing communication protocols and network parameters to ensure reliable data transmission in such environments.
The study by Guzinski et al. (2014a) using a modified TSEB model further highlights the importance of high-resolution data in accurately capturing the spatial and temporal dynamics of energy fluxes influenced by environmental factors. This emphasizes the need for advanced data acquisition and processing techniques that can effectively represent the complexities of agricultural settings.
The limitations of traditional wireless communication technologies, such as limited range and network congestion, pose additional challenges for large-scale agricultural operations. Long-distance data transmission can be hindered by range limitations, while network congestion arising from numerous sensors transmitting concurrently can lead to delays and data loss, hindering real-time decision-making (Hameed et al., 2020). Addressing these challenges requires the exploration of advanced networking technologies that can optimize spectrum utilization, mitigate interference, and improve reliability and efficiency.
Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) and Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) offer promising solutions for optimizing wireless communication in agricultural settings. CRNs empower devices with the ability to intelligently sense and adapt to the surrounding radio environment, dynamically adjusting transmission parameters to avoid interference and improve communication efficiency (Righi et al., 2017; Shafi et al., 2018; Trigka & Dritsas, 2022). Research has explored the potential of CRNs in predicting Radio Frequency (RF) power to avoid noisy channels and optimize spectrum utilization (Iliya et al., 2014; Iliya et al., 2014). These studies demonstrate the effectiveness of combining optimization algorithms with artificial neural networks (ANNs) to enhance the accuracy and generalization of RF power prediction, enabling CRNs to make informed decisions about channel selection and avoid interference.
DSA complements CRN technology by dynamically allocating unused spectrum, further enhancing spectrum utilization and reducing congestion (Shi et al., 2023). The numerical model developed by Shi et al. (2023) showcases the potential of CRNs and DSA for optimizing wireless communication in challenging environments.
The integration of CRNs and DSA into the IoT network architecture requires careful consideration of spectrum sensing techniques, network topology, and data security. Research on cooperative spectrum sensing suggests that distributed approaches, where sensor nodes collaborate and share information, can significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of spectrum sensing, particularly in dynamic environments (Trigka and Dritsas, 2022; Khalid & Yu, 2019). This collaborative approach enables a more comprehensive understanding of the radio environment and facilitates the identification of available frequency bands for data transmission.
The choice of network topology also impacts the performance and scalability of CRN-based irrigation systems. Mesh networks, where sensor nodes are interconnected and relay data for each other, offer enhanced resilience and coverage compared to star topologies where nodes communicate directly with a central gateway (Akyildiz & Vuran, 2010). However, mesh networks can be more complex to manage and may introduce additional routing overhead. The trade-off between network resilience and complexity needs to be carefully evaluated to select the most appropriate topology for a specific agricultural setting.
Data security and privacy are paramount concerns in IoT-based irrigation systems due to the sensitive nature of agricultural data (Gupta et al., 2020). Implementing secure communication protocols, authentication mechanisms, and encryption techniques is essential for protecting data integrity and ensuring system trustworthiness. Research on secure spectrum leasing and resource allocation algorithms for CR-WSN-based irrigation systems has demonstrated the potential of these technologies for enhancing security and efficiency (Hassan, 2023; Afghah et al., 2018).
In conclusion, the development of effective and reliable real-time irrigation management systems requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the challenges of data transmission in agricultural environments. The integration of robust and adaptive communication protocols, optimized network architectures, and advanced networking technologies like CRNs and DSA, along with a focus on data security and privacy, can contribute significantly to achieving the goal of autonomous and efficient irrigation scheduling.
4. AUTOMATED DATA PROCESSING IN THE CLOUD
4.1. Data Quality and Preprocessing
Data quality is paramount in automated irrigation systems as it directly influences the effectiveness of decision-making and water use efficiency. Issues like missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers arising from sensor malfunctions, environmental interference, or network problems (Lv et al., 2023) can significantly impact the performance of machine learning models used for irrigation scheduling and management.
Real-time data cleaning techniques are essential for addressing these challenges. Kalman filtering proves particularly effective in handling missing values and correcting erroneous readings by recursively estimating the system's state based on previous measurements and current sensor data, taking into account noise and uncertainty (Kim et al., 2020). Moving average techniques, by averaging consecutive data points, provide a more stable representation of the underlying trend, filtering out short-term fluctuations (Chhetri, 2023). For outlier detection, adaptive thresholding methods offer a dynamic approach, adjusting thresholds based on the statistical properties of the data to effectively identify anomalies and minimize false positives (Bah et al., 2021). These techniques are crucial in maintaining the integrity of real-time data streams and ensuring the accuracy of subsequent analyses.
Adaptive data preprocessing is essential for managing the diversity of data sources and formats commonly found in irrigation systems. Data normalization techniques, such as min-max scaling or z-score normalization, ensure that all features contribute equally to the analysis by transforming data values to a common scale (Pradal et al., 2016). This is crucial for preventing features with larger values from dominating the analysis and ensuring that all features are given equal consideration. Similarly, feature scaling methods, like standardization or normalization, optimize the range of feature values to improve the performance and convergence of machine learning models (Tortorici et al., 2024). By scaling features to a similar range, the influence of outliers is reduced, and the model's ability to learn from the data is enhanced.
Data fusion techniques play a critical role in integrating information from diverse sources, creating a more comprehensive and reliable dataset for irrigation management. Dempster-Shafer theory, a generalization of probability theory, allows for the expression of both uncertainty and the degree of conflict in evidence, making it suitable for fusing uncertain and conflicting data from heterogeneous sources (Sadiq and Rodriguez, 2004). This is particularly relevant in irrigation systems where data from different sensors may provide slightly different or even contradictory information due to sensor variations or environmental factors. Bayesian inference offers another powerful framework for combining information from multiple sources, updating the probability of a hypothesis as new evidence becomes available. By applying these techniques, data from soil moisture sensors, canopy temperature sensors, weather stations, and other sources can be integrated to provide a holistic understanding of crop water requirements and environmental conditions, leading to more informed and accurate irrigation decisions.
The impact of data quality extends beyond model accuracy to the robustness of machine learning models under varying conditions. Robust models should maintain consistent performance even when faced with data inconsistencies or unexpected situations. Techniques like data augmentation and domain adaptation can enhance model robustness by exposing the model to a wider range of data variations during training. Data augmentation involves generating additional training data by applying transformations or introducing noise to existing data, making the model more resilient to noise and variations in the real-world data. Domain adaptation techniques aim to adapt a model trained on one domain (e.g., a specific crop or geographic location) to perform well on another domain with different data characteristics. This is particularly relevant in irrigation management, where models may need to be applied to different crops, soil types, or climatic conditions.
The choice of data cleaning, preprocessing, and fusion techniques should be carefully considered based on the specific characteristics of the irrigation system and the available data. By selecting and implementing appropriate techniques, the accuracy, reliability, and robustness of machine learning models can be significantly improved, leading to more efficient and sustainable irrigation management practices.
4.2. Scalable and Autonomous Deployment using Containerization Strategies
The transition from data collection and transmission to efficient data processing requires a robust infrastructure capable of handling diverse workloads and data volumes. Containerization technologies, specifically Docker and Kubernetes, offer a promising solution for deploying and scaling data processing and machine learning modules within cloud environments like AWS, Azure, and GCP (Vargas-Rojas et al., 2024; Rosendo et al., 2022; Solayman & Qasha, 2023). Docker provides a standardized way to package applications and their dependencies into self-contained units known as containers, ensuring consistent and reproducible execution across different platforms (Rosendo et al., 2022). Kubernetes, acting as a container orchestrator, manages their deployment, scaling, and networking across a cluster of machines (Rosendo et al., 2022). This combination presents several advantages for automated irrigation management systems.
Firstly, containerization facilitates efficient resource utilization and scalability. By encapsulating applications and their dependencies, containers enable the isolation of resources and prevent conflicts between different modules (Vargas-Rojas et al., 2024; Solayman & Qasha, 2023). This isolation allows for the efficient allocation of resources, such as CPU, memory, and storage, to each container based on its specific needs. Kubernetes further enhances scalability by allowing for the automatic scaling of containers based on real-time demand, ensuring the system can adapt to varying workloads and data volumes, preventing bottlenecks, and ensuring responsiveness to changing conditions (Karamolegkos et al., 2023).
Secondly, containerization promotes portability and reproducibility. By packaging applications and their dependencies into a single unit, containers make it easy to move and deploy them across different cloud environments without the need for environment-specific configurations (Rosendo et al., 2022; Solayman & Qasha, 2023). This portability simplifies the development and deployment process, reducing the time and effort required to set up and manage the system. Additionally, containers ensure reproducibility by providing a consistent execution environment, regardless of the underlying infrastructure. This eliminates variability and ensures that the system will behave consistently across different deployments (Zhou et al., 2023).
Optimizing container orchestration and resource allocation is crucial to minimizing latency and maximizing throughput in real-time data processing pipelines. Techniques like auto-scaling and dynamic resource allocation play a critical role in this context (Hethcoat et al., 2024; Werner and Tai, 2023; Kumar et al., 2024). Auto-scaling automatically adjusts the number of container instances based on real-time demand, ensuring that sufficient resources are available to handle peak workloads while avoiding over-provisioning during periods of low demand (Hethcoat et al., 2024; Kumar et al., 2024). Dynamic resource allocation enables the fine-grained adjustment of resources allocated to each container based on its specific needs and the current workload (Werner and Tai, 2023). This ensures efficient resource allocation and provides each container with the necessary resources to perform its tasks effectively.
Performance monitoring tools, such as Kubernetes Metrics Server and Prometheus, are essential for gaining insights into the performance of containers and the overall system (Hethcoat et al., 2024; Kuity & Peddoju, 2023). These tools provide valuable data on key performance indicators, such as CPU and memory usage, network traffic, and application-specific metrics. By monitoring this data, administrators can identify bottlenecks, optimize resource allocation strategies, and continuously improve system performance (Hethcoat et al., 2024). This data-driven approach ensures that automated irrigation management systems can operate efficiently and reliably.
By integrating containerization technologies with optimization techniques and performance monitoring, automated irrigation management systems achieve the scalability, autonomy, and efficiency required for effective real-time data processing and decision-making. This approach facilitates a seamless and responsive system that can adapt to changing conditions and contribute to the overall goal of optimizing water resource management and increasing agricultural productivity.

4.3. Deploying ML Models for Data Processing
Transitioning from data collection, preprocessing, and transmission, the deployment of machine learning (ML) models marks a pivotal stage in the automated irrigation management pipeline. This stage entails utilizing cloud platforms to facilitate real-time data processing and inference, enabling data-driven decision-making for optimal irrigation management and ultimately contributing to fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.
Several architectures and frameworks exist for deploying ML models on cloud platforms, each offering unique advantages and catering to different requirements. TensorFlow Serving, for instance, provides a high-performance system specifically designed for serving TensorFlow models (Abadi et al., 2016). This framework enables efficient and scalable inference, making it suitable for real-time applications where low latency and high throughput are crucial. For instance, in a large-scale irrigation system with numerous sensors generating data continuously, TensorFlow Serving can efficiently handle the high volume of inference requests and provide timely predictions for irrigation scheduling. Similarly, Apache MXNet Model Server offers a flexible and efficient solution for deploying models trained with MXNet, supporting a wide range of deep learning models and inference backends (MXNet Developers, 2015). This versatility makes it suitable for complex irrigation systems that may utilize different types of ML models for various tasks, such as predicting crop water requirements, detecting plant stress, or forecasting weather conditions. ONNX Runtime, on the other hand, provides a cross-platform inference engine compatible with various ML frameworks, including PyTorch, TensorFlow, and MXNet (Microsoft, 2017). This versatility enables the deployment of models in diverse environments, facilitating interoperability and reducing the need for model conversion. For example, an irrigation system that uses models trained in different frameworks can utilize ONNX Runtime to deploy them on a single platform without the need for time-consuming and error-prone model conversion processes.
Choosing the appropriate architecture or framework depends on several factors, including the specific ML framework used for model training, the desired level of performance and scalability, and the need for cross-platform compatibility. For instance, if the primary concern is low latency and high throughput for real-time inference, TensorFlow Serving might be the optimal choice for TensorFlow models. However, if flexibility and support for various deep learning models are required, Apache MXNet Model Server could be more suitable. In cases where cross-platform compatibility is essential, ONNX Runtime offers a versatile solution.
Once the ML model is deployed, optimizing its performance and resource utilization becomes crucial for ensuring the efficiency of integrated end-to-end automated irrigation systems. Model compression techniques, such as pruning and quantization, offer effective methods for reducing the size and computational requirements of ML models without compromising accuracy (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). Pruning involves eliminating unnecessary connections or neurons from the model, effectively streamlining its structure and reducing computational complexity. This can be particularly beneficial for deep learning models, which often have a large number of parameters and can be prone to overfitting. By removing redundant or less important connections, pruning can improve modelgeneralizability and reduce inference time. Quantization, on the other hand, involves reducing the precision of model parameters, typically from 32-bit floating-point numbers to lower-precision formats such as 8-bit integers. This reduction in precision leads to smaller model sizes and faster inference speeds, making it particularly beneficial for resource-constrained environments or real-time applications. For instance, in edge computing scenarios where ML models are deployed on devices with limited computational resources, quantization can enable efficient inference without sacrificing accuracy.
Furthermore, hardware acceleration through the utilization of GPUs or TPUs can significantly enhance model performance by leveraging specialized hardware designed for parallel processing (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). GPUs, with their massive parallelism and high memory bandwidth, excel at accelerating matrix operations and convolutions, which are fundamental computations in many deep learning models. This acceleration can significantly reduce inference time and enable real-time processing of sensor data for timely irrigation decisions. TPUs, specifically designed for deep learning workloads, offer even greater performance and energy efficiency for specific model architectures. These hardware accelerators can drastically reduce inference time, enabling near real-time decision-making and enhancing the responsiveness of automated irrigation systems. For example, in a scenario where immediate response to changing weather conditions or soil moisture levels is critical, hardware acceleration can ensure that irrigation decisions are made and executed promptly.
In addition to model compression and hardware acceleration, distributed training techniques play a crucial role in optimizing the training process for large-scale ML models. Techniques such as Horovod and BytePS enable the distribution of training across multiple machines, effectively parallelizing the process and reducing training time (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). This is particularly beneficial for complex models with a large number of parameters or when dealing with large datasets. By leveraging distributed training, irrigation management systems can train more sophisticated models and improve their predictive capabilities, leading to more accurate and efficient irrigation decisions. For instance, a system that utilizes a deep learning model with millions of parameters can benefit from distributed training to reduce training time from days to hours, enabling faster model iteration and improvement.
Integrating the deployed ML models with other components of the automated irrigation management pipeline is essential for achieving a fully autonomous and cohesive system and addressing the need for seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system. Standardized protocols, such as MQTT and CoAP, provide lightweight and efficient communication channels for exchanging data between these components (Poojara et al., 2023; Jimenez et al., 2020a; Gour et al., 2023). MQTT, with its publish-subscribe architecture, enables real-time data streaming and event-driven communication, making it suitable for transmitting sensor data, control signals, and inference results (Raikar & M, 2023). This enables the ML model to receive real-time updates on soil moisture, weather conditions, and plant health, allowing for dynamic adjustments to irrigation schedules based on the latest data. CoAP, designed for constrained devices and low-power networks, offers a web-transfer protocol for resource-constrained environments, enabling efficient communication between sensors, actuators, and the ML models (Raikar & M, 2023). This is particularly relevant in situations where sensors or actuators have limited processing power or battery life, as CoAP minimizes communication overhead and energy consumption. Additionally, RESTful APIs provide a standardized interface for accessing and controlling the ML models, enabling seamless integration with other software components and facilitating system management and monitoring (Wang et al., 2022). This allows for easy integration with existing farm management systems or third-party applications, creating a unified platform for comprehensive irrigation management.4.4. Online Learning in the Cloud
The complexities of real-time data processing in irrigation management necessitate the exploration of advanced techniques to continuously learn and adapt to the dynamic nature of agricultural environments. Online learning algorithms offer a promising solution, enabling the continuous update and improvement of machine learning models based on incoming real-time data. This adaptability is crucial for addressing the challenges of changing environmental conditions, such as weather patterns and crop growth stages, and optimizing irrigation decision-making to enhance water usage efficiency and crop productivity.
Several online learning algorithms have demonstrated potential for real-time data processing and model adaptation in the context of irrigation management. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) facilitates the incremental update of model parameters with each new data point, allowing for efficient adaptation to changing data distributions (Bottou, 2010). This incremental learning process ensures that the model remains responsive to the latest conditions, minimizing the risk of outdated predictions and improving the accuracy of irrigation decisions. Passive-Aggressive algorithms, on the other hand, adjust model parameters only when a misclassification occurs, providing a computationally efficient approach for handling large data streams (Crammer et al., 2006). These algorithms offer a robust approach to handling noisy data, a common challenge in real-world sensor readings, by making small adjustments only when the model's prediction deviates significantly from the actual value (Fei et al., 2019). Online Random Forests extend the concept of random forests to the online setting, enabling the incremental construction and update of decision trees as new data arrives (Saffari et al., 2009). The continuous evolution of the ensemble ensures that the model remains relevant to the changing environment, capturing intricate relationships between variables and leading to more informed irrigation decisions.
Research in various domains highlights the importance of online learning for real-time data stream analytics. Snyder et al. (2020) explored the application of online learning techniques for identifying relevant tweets in real-time, improving situational awareness for first responders. The proposed interactive learning framework allows users to continuously label the relevance of incoming tweets, enabling the real-time refinement of the underlying machine learning model. This user-guided approach aligns well with the dynamic nature of irrigation management, where models need to continuously adjust to varying environmental conditions and crop water requirements. Similarly, research in the field of cyber-physical systems (CPS) underscores the need for online learning algorithms to effectively extract insights and knowledge from continuously generated data streams (Fei et al., 2019). These capabilities are crucial for enabling feedback loops between physical processes and cyber elements, facilitating the integration and optimization of CPS in irrigation management systems.
To implement online learning in cloud-based irrigation management systems, various architectures and frameworks can be considered. Apache Spark Streaming, Apache Flink, and AWS Kinesis provide scalable and fault-tolerant platforms for processing real-time data streams, allowing for the development of online learning pipelines that continuously ingest and analyze data to update machine learning models (Zaharia et al., 2012; Carbone et al., 2015; Amazon Web Services, 2023). These frameworks leverage serverless computing paradigms, automatically scaling resources based on the volume and velocity of incoming data, ensuring efficient resource utilization and responsiveness to fluctuations in demand (Fei et al., 2019).
Effectively managing the exploration-exploitation trade-off is crucial for optimizing online learning in irrigation management. Techniques such as Multi-armed bandits (Sutton & Barto, 2018), Bayesian optimization (Shahriari et al., 2016), and Reinforcement Learning (RL) (Sutton & Barto, 2018) can be employed to balance the allocation of resources between exploring new irrigation strategies and exploiting the current best-performing approaches. These techniques enable the identification of optimal irrigation policies, adapting to changing environmental conditions and maximizing long-term rewards.
In conclusion, online learning techniques, coupled with scalable cloud-based architectures, offer a powerful solution for real-time data processing and continuous adaptation in irrigation management systems. By leveraging algorithms like SGD, Passive-Aggressive, and Online Random Forests, along with stream processing frameworks like Apache Spark Streaming, Apache Flink, and AWS Kinesis, irrigation management systems can effectively handle the complexities of real-time data, optimize water usage, and enhance crop productivity in the face of dynamic environmental conditions.

Food security is an issue that arises as a result of the rising population since population growth decreases 
agricultural land, leading to water scarcity. Agriculture requires large amounts of water, but water scarcity forces 
farmers to irrigate their crops with little or low-quality water, leading to the idea of developing smart irrigation. The 
challenge is how to manage the interactions between plants, growing media, microclimate, and water using 
manufactured systems. Good irrigation management will minimize the occurrence of poor irrigation design. This 
review is a way to present various methods and approaches for using sensors, controllers, the Internet of Things, 
and artificial intelligence in irrigation systems with a focus on improving water use efficiency. The study uses 
SCOPUS indexed publications and proceedings to study the evolution of irrigation information technology over the 
last eleven years. We hope this review can serve as a source of information to broaden the validity of the findings 
of irrigation monitoring and control technologies and help researchers identify future research directions on this 
subject.

INTRODUCTION 
Due to rising food demand and a growing human population, agriculture is the primary food supplier and the most 
prominent labor user. It is also one of the essential areas in a country's economy, according to gross domestic 
product (GDP) [1], [2]. Water availability is an essential factor in optimizing the growth of crops so that water 
scarcity can threaten food security. This reason makes water conservation an essential factor in overcoming water 
shortages while increasing yields. [3, 4]. Moreover, the development of agricultural technology and more efficient 
agricultural management can produce productive crops and quality harvests through greenhouse technology. 
Developing greenhouses for agriculture can increase crop yields and improve water use efficiency [5].  
Around 3.5% of the world's agricultural land uses greenhouse and hydroponic systems to conserve water use and 
other benefits such as crop protection and quality yields. A greenhouse is a building with a wooden or metal 
foundation covered with nets or transparent material. Since 1960 the greenhouse has evolved from a building that 
only protects plants into a system for studying plant growth in a controlled environment [6, 7]. Changes in 
agricultural land usage, lower irrigation water output in primary, secondary, and tertiary canals, and global 
microclimate changes contribute to the rising use of greenhouses in world agriculture [8].  
Agricultural ecosystems (soil, nutrients, temperature, humidity, sunlight, wind, and air composition) can be adapted 
to the needs of the plants planted in greenhouses to extend productive plant life, change planting seasons, 
increase crop yields and improve harvest quality. [9, 10]. Moving crops from their natural environment to 
greenhouses protect plants from weather and microclimate uncertainties. On the downside, a greenhouse is a 
place that can store solar heat and requires resources to manage the microclimate according to plant needs, 
especially in countries with tropical climates. [4, 11]. Crop growth problems arise in agriculture that depends on rain 
and drought; runoff and erosion problems also arise during heavy rains. Water control is needed to meet crop 
water needs while conserving water [12]. The water control system functioned as a regulator for water flow 
according to the plant's needs in its growth phase [13, 14]. 
Conventional irrigation systems use a uniform amount of water to fields from one corner to another during their 
growth period regardless of the type of plant and its water needs. The result is water-wasting, where one side of 
the land has sufficient water, while the other can have excess or lack of water [15]. Therefore, a control system 
known as an intelligent irrigation system is needed to support plants' water needs while saving water. The way the 
system works, in general, is to adapt to the type of plant and then automatically calculate the water needs of the

plant and schedule water supply based on the plant growth phase [16]. Intelligent irrigation systems are suitable for 
use in a greenhouse because a greenhouse has an enclosed structure to reduce or eliminate parameters affecting 
plant growth, such as seasons, rainfall, climate change, plant pests and diseases, and environmental changes [17, 
18]. 
Intelligent irrigation systems are part of precision agriculture, also known as smart farming, which integrates 
information technology, communication technology, and control technology to automate various agricultural 
activities that humans initially did. With an intelligent irrigation system, the irrigation process can run optimally in 
managing water to meet the needs of plants [19]. Intelligent irrigation systems can manage water needs based on 
various parameters such as microclimate conditions, weather, sunlight, water quality such as acidity (pH), turbidity 
(TDS), and electrical conductivity (EC), along with plant growth phases through the Internet of Things (IoT) devices. 
An intelligent irrigation system can improve irrigation decisions to achieve water savings and increased yields [20–
22]. 
The intelligent irrigation system is one of the best systems in managing and saving water while maximizing 
harvests; water is distributed evenly to each plant according to its needs and minimizes wasted water [23]. This 
system can also mix nutrients and water and help deliver them directly to the root zone, ensuring it is always in 
optimal moist conditions, minimizing surface runoff, preventing root rot, and eliminating percolation. The advantage 
is increased crop productivity, and better harvest quality also ensures optimal water efficiency. Nevertheless, good 
integration between IoT devices, monitoring, control, and data acquisition can be done automatically with minimum 
intervention to get an optimal and efficient, intelligent irrigation system [24, 25]. 
In the intelligent irrigation system, the controller can process input data, present information, and manage irrigation 
based on greenhouse conditions, especially crop conditions to prevent water deficit. Nevertheless, in addition to 
system automation, it is necessary to present current and past system conditions to users, both plant responses to 
the system and vice versa. This method ensures that water management runs smoothly, and users can study 
historical data as a reference for the next planting period and ensure optimal farming [26–29]. This process 
requires real-time monitoring, sophisticated control systems, and precise instruments. The difference between a 
monitoring system and a control system is that the control system regulates the hardware according to conditional 
constraints. The control system manages the hardware and software by defining the output and input parameters 
precisely. The input is microclimate parameters, plant properties, weather conditions, water quality, and other 
sensors collect helpful information [30–33]. 
Many articles published on IoT focus on agriculture, as discussed by [30, 34]. IoT is one of the best inventions of 
the 21st century in agriculture. In addition, review articles  [21], [35] discuss IoT opportunities in agriculture or 
intelligent farming and how the connection between IoT, data mining, data science, and machine learning 
sustainability supports agriculture. [36] describes the automation model for monitoring and controlling the 
agricultural sector and predicting information based on past data. There are currently no review studies that explore 
the monitoring and control strategy of intelligent irrigation systems in greenhouses, necessitating the formation of 
intelligent irrigation system review articles that focus on integrating various monitoring and control materials. As a 
result, this study will cover intelligent irrigation system monitoring and control mechanisms and their relevance to 
greenhouses and irrigation. 
This study aims to classify the results of previous research, identify the results, and bridge them with future trends 
to identify future research. Chapter 2 discusses research methodology, and Chapter 3 discusses various irrigation 
methods used by intelligent irrigation systems. In contrast, Chapter 4 discusses monitoring and controlling 
strategies for IoT and then continues to Chapter 5, discussing the integration of artificial intelligence. The last 
chapter discusses future directions and trends in intelligent irrigation. 
2 REVIEW METHODOLOGY 
The methodology applied in selecting published literature with the theme of intelligent farming focuses on the topic 
of intelligent irrigation systems and their control systems by using an extensive search on several online libraries of 
multidisciplinary journals as Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, Springer, MDPI, and IOP, as well as online 
engineering libraries as Agricola and IEEE Xplore. This technique produces many research articles relevant to 
intelligent farming and irrigation systems and their relationship to monitoring and control. That is why it is essential 
to check the reputation of the publisher's journal before using the article through the SCOPUS and ScimagoJR 
websites. This review's selection of relevant articles emphasizes the latest journal articles in the last eleven years 
(2011 - 2021); it can be seen in Figure 1a that in 2020 there was a surge in articles discussing monitoring, control, 
and artificial intelligence in agriculture. Other conditions are that all articles must be published in SCOPUS indexed 
journals and conference proceedings. As shown in Figure 1b, which shows the percentage of articles indexed by 
SCOPUS with articles with Quartile 1 dominating research in this field means that the research is internationally 
recognized and has the best quality content. All articles used are smart farming, intelligent irrigation system, and 
precision agriculture. Articles are carefully selected by reading and summarizing them to ensure continuity of ideas.

3 TYPES OF IRRIGATION 
Plants need water at regular intervals to grow and develop; in agriculture, this watering technique is called 
irrigation. Irrigation has two methods, namely conventional and modern. Conventional agriculture usually uses rain 
and surface irrigation to irrigate its land [37, 38]. The problem is how to predict rain accurately, and surface 
irrigation does not continuously irrigate the entire land with a uniform discharge. Surface irrigation, classified as 
conventional irrigation, works by distributing water from springs or rivers to the ground surface following gravity; 
monitoring is done manually by looking at the water level without IoT and automation [37].  
Developing countries generally use surface irrigation, for example, Indonesia. It uses it to irrigate paddy fields by 
constructing furrows that connect water sources with rice fields and irrigate them. However, this method requires a 
level ground surface to ensure adequate water distribution [39]. On the other hand, surface irrigation results in high 
levels of water loss due to evaporation, uncontrolled water discharge, and percolation, which can reduce soil 
nutrient levels resulting in sub-optimal crop yields [37]. There are two commonly used surface irrigations: (1) 
Furrow irrigation is interpreted as water flowing through small furrows made on the land slope. Water enters the soil 
from the bottom and sides of the furrow and moves laterally and downwards to moisten the soil and simultaneously 
carry dissolved salts, fertilizers, and herbicides [40]. Good tillage with uniform slopes can give better results from 
this method. Furrow irrigation is suitable for various soils, slopes, and crops especially row crops. Crops that will be 
damaged if water covers the stems or crowns should use furrow irrigation [40, 41]. Furrow irrigation is also suitable 
for tree crops. In the early stages of tree planting, using one furrow beside the tree row may be sufficient, but as the 
tree grows, creating two or more new furrows is necessary to provide sufficient water [42]. (2) Flooding Irrigation is 
an irrigation method commonly used to provide water in lowland rice cultivation and generally, water carried out 
continuously. Flooding is carried out continuously at the same height throughout plant growth, starting from planting 
until several days before harvest [43]. The use of flooding irrigation depends on sufficient water to flood the land 
surface with 10 cm of water. The disadvantage is inhibiting plant growth and water wastage [44]. Because flooding 
irrigation uses water excessively, flooding irrigation evolved into intermittent irrigation by flooding and drying the 
land alternately from planting season until one week before the flowering. The water level is maintained at 3 to 5 
cm during flowering. Giving water this way can reduce water usage up to 30 percent without reducing crop yields 
[43–45] 
 Modern irrigation offers uniform discharge for each plant, including nutrients and saving water, mainly when 
planting is carried out in a greenhouse, making it easier to monitor water quantity and quality and regulate water 
supply schedules [46, 47]. The amount of water delivered is determined by the plant's demands, irrigation method, 
and type of growing medium. The choice of irrigation method influences the type of nutrients, the number of 
nutrients, the rate of infiltration, evaporation, water absorption, and drainage [12]. 
Modern irrigation uses less water and is more efficient than conventional irrigation, and this method saves more 
energy and water. It is an effective method for use in areas where water is scarce or has irregular rains. This 
method allows farmers to cultivate crops consistently, creating a reliable food supply [3, 11]. Modern irrigation relies 
on water from wells, lakes, and reservoirs stored in water tanks and then irrigates plants using gravity or water 
pumps [12]. The method of giving water is even more specific, such as spraying water through a sprinkler or 
dripping water through an emitter onto plants. [39] developed an automatic irrigation data communication system

through the General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) and Zigbee module and built a microprocessor-based gateway 
to better control water discharge with water efficiency than conventional irrigation systems, with the difference 
between conventional and modern irrigation can be seen in Figure 2. 
 
Fig 2. Types of irrigation 
3.1 
Sprinkler Irrigation 
Farmers use sprinkler irrigation to mimic precipitation patterns. They used small sprinkler nozzles connected to an 
extensive piping system to ensure comprehensive irrigation coverage and used pumps to spray high-pressure 
water onto the air [48]. The advantage of sprinkler is that it minimizes runoff, is suitable for all types of soil, and has 
a water-saving rate of between 30 - 50%. Sprinkles can be mixed with fertilizer solutions and used in close 
cropping and high plant population [28]. However, this method has high operating costs for cleaning sprinkler 
nozzles and maintaining high-pressure pumps and pipes. In addition, sprinkler irrigation is unsuitable for use in 
windy areas because wind gusts and evapotranspiration cause high water loss rates. Moreover, regular 
maintenance of the pipes and their connections to avoid leaks or clogs can reduce the water spray pressure, 
reducing water distribution to the plants [37, 48]. 
3.2 
Drip Irrigation 
In drip irrigation, the water source moistens the soil or planting media through the holes in the pipes and flows 
through a hose connected to the emitter with low pressure. The focus of water droplets is a small part of the soil or 
growing medium that covers the root zone by adjusting it to get water droplets [49]. Drip irrigation is the most 
efficient irrigation because it can distribute water and nutrients simultaneously to the root zone, which results in 
better nutrient uptake. Due to the circulation of water in the roots through the capillary principle, the pores of the 
soil or planting medium remain dry so that air circulation is maintained and soil moisture is at field capacity. 
Produces a root zone capable of breathing more intensely during its growth cycle [25, 37, 50]. 
Drip irrigation uses dripping water delivered at a rate of between 2 - 20 liters per hour. The application of this 
method is to place an emitter on each plant. It is suitable for use on vegetables and fruit, but farmers usually only 
consider high-value plants because the investment value is relatively high [37, 49]. This method supports various 
types of soil by adjusting the speed of water application. Hefty porous sandy soils need a fast drip-rate; conversely, 
clay soil needs a slow drip rate to avoid water logging and runoff [25, 37]. 
4 MONITORING AND CONTROLLING STRATEGIES 
A total of 30 papers were used to examine the irrigation system's monitoring and control method. These 
publications provide ways for regulating irrigation by employing sensors to measure changes in microclimate, water 
quality, and soil moisture values. The paper's distribution is represented in Figure 3 below. 
An effective and efficient monitoring system is needed to collect different plant growth parameters. Monitoring in an 
intelligent irrigation system involves collecting data representing the latest microclimate data and water and soil 
conditions around the irrigation area through a microcontroller connected to the IoT [51], shown in Figure 4. The 
development of real-time monitoring devices was made possible due to the rapid development of microcontrollers 
and sensors, low-cost hardware (Arduino UNO, ESP8266, Raspberry Pi), and fast internet, which enhanced the 
performance of monitoring and control systems [17, 52]. There are two types of internet connections: wired and 
wireless; Wired connections make the internet connection stable, but with fixed hardware location. Wireless 
connection makes flexible hardware placement but has signal interference [53].

All devices and sensors are connected directly to the server via a cabling system in a wired connection case. This 
system is only effective when a few parameters are measured and use a small greenhouse; it is crucial because 
the more connected devices, the more cables are used. So, the wired greenhouse system is not suitable for large 
or commercial greenhouses. The advantage is that data transactions are safe and have minimal interference [51, 
53, 54]. WSN is the latest technology in intelligent farming that can be expanded and scaled up without modifying 
the greenhouse infrastructure. Its wireless form makes it easy to receive and transmit data between nodes using 
low-power frequencies. Unfortunately, interference and signal loss are common problems because of the high 
frequency in the air. However, the increase in greenhouse size, the number of parameters, sensors variety, node 
size, and devices distant is not a problem because an additional WSN only needs to be attached to an existing 
network. Another advantage is Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) technology, wirelessly connected sensor nodes 
network to sense and send various data, and extensible [36, 54, 55]. 
The implementation of WSN in agriculture itself is extensive, with sensors, RFID, cameras, drones, and cloud 
services connected seamlessly for data acquisition and transmission. Cloud computing serves data collection and 
analysis to generate visualizations, decision support, and commands; system users (farmers or researchers) can 
then access data remotely via their devices to gain real-time insights [19, 56]. Thus, monitoring and controlling the 
intelligent irrigation system can be effective, efficient, convenient, and optimal yields. [55] proposed the approach 
with WSN and gateway node to collect soil moisture values in plants by taking soil and cultivated plants images. 
The challenges in building a system that can accommodate these two technologies are sensor coverage, 
communication between devices, computational process efficiency, and electricity usage. [57] also offers UAVs for 
aerial monitoring of vegetation and irrigation areas. 
Appropriate control techniques in intelligent irrigation systems can increase crop water supply precisely to improve 
the efficiency of water use, energy savings, harvest optimization, proper use of nutrients, and effective use of labor.

Therefore, a control system can manipulate several irrigation parameters, like air circulation, air temperature, 
relative humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation [58–60]. A technology that can analyze the surface temperature 
of agricultural land without touching it using thermal imaging was proposed by [61] to determine which areas of 
land are in dire need of water because the non-uniformity of soil moisture can inhibit spinach growth. Studies by 
[56, 62–64] also state that it is possible to use thermal imaging for nurseries, forecasting crop yields, pest and 
disease disturbances, maintenance of agricultural machinery, and irrigation scheduling. 
4.1 
Microclimate based  
Monitoring and controlling the microclimate in the greenhouse is a critical factor to account for water loss due to 
evaporation. Air temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation, and wind speed need precision measurements to 
meet crop water requirements [30, 65]. The Raspberry Pi, various Arduino models, connected to WSN, and cloud 
servers are popular hardware. WSN implementation is an efficient way to interconnect various sensors placed far 
apart in the greenhouse. The system performs accurate system monitoring, collects data, and presents charts, and 
control devices are activated, referring to predefined threshold values compared with real-time data [30, 36, 66]. 
[59] presented a technique for evaluating microclimate parameters in two tropical greenhouses before planting 
tomatoes using LoRa wireless and IoT sensors. The comfort ratio model (CftM) and scenario analysis show that 
environmental conditions can adapt to the growth phase of tomato plants. The microclimate before and during 
planting was analyzed using the Simulink app. Also, a study by [67] showed that a microclimate parameter 
measurement device in a greenhouse could yield comprehensive data for temperature, humidity, CO2 levels, 
lighting levels, soil moisture, acidity, irrigation water conductivity, and airflow velocity. In winter, the greenhouse 
behavior was studied by [68] using fuzzy logic control (FLC) due to uncertainty in the greenhouse environment. The 
fuzzy set was developed based on experts in greenhouse thermal behavior. Fuzzy control manages decisions 
based on weather forecasts and user interactions. [54] also took a similar approach to measure leaf temperature, 
air temperature, and soil moisture using three connected sensors to assess the level of microclimate in a 
greenhouse and use Zigbee to transmit sensor data. 
Controlling the microclimate in the greenhouse by using fan ventilation and fan-pad ventilation can also be an 
option. This forced ventilation can prevent plants from overheating even if the greenhouse does not use an 
evaporative cooling system. Greenhouses can produce good harvests in the spring, and the data show a 
relationship between the greenhouse microclimate and water uptake that minimizes drainage [69]. [70] built a 
monitoring system using an open-source platform to collect microclimate variables (air temperature, humidity, soil 
temperature, and soil moisture). Communication between devices uses Bluetooth and obtain electricity supply 
through solar panels. [71] has proposed improvements to the greenhouse IoT-based system by adding color 
spectrum monitoring using a camera system to get photos of the plant canopies translated into color (RGB, HSL, 
and brightness), plant texture, thermal (plant temperature), and plant morphology. The system works with NFT to 
irrigate lettuce plants in the greenhouse, automatically recording data and identifying plant stress levels. 
4.2 
Water Quality-based 
Water quality safety is a challenge in the 21st century because of the many pollutants, which are predominantly 
artificial such as environmental damage, packaging waste, or chemical waste. Overexploitation of natural 
resources, rapid industrial development, and agricultural expansion are the leading causes of the problem. [72]. 
Water quality is affected by direct and indirect sources of pollution such as sewage, factory waste, agricultural and 
urban runoff. The need for human involvement in water quality management is essential [73, 74]. Water quality 
management is a way to regularly collect water quality information in a location to find out its current condition. 
Water quality management aims to measure water quality variables such as microbial content physical and 
chemical properties, provide an early warning system and provide decision support for further treatment [75, 76]. 
WSN and IoT are inevitable to manage variables over a wide area for larger areas such as lakes or oceans. 
[75] has proposed a system that assesses irrigation water quality with IoT by detecting potential hydrogen (pH), 
electrical conductivity (EC), turbidity, and salinity in real-time using different sensors to maintain plant health status. 
Also, [77] undertook a study to build a continuous water quality monitoring system using open-source hardware 
and low-cost sensors. Preliminary results show that the device can produce accurate results at a lower cost than 
existing technologies with proper calibration. 
4.3 
Soil Moisture-based 
Farmers need to consider soil conditions because moist soil means the plant still has enough water for growth [11]. 
Monitoring soil moisture content becomes vital as the basis for irrigation scheduling. Raspberry Pi and Arduino 
UNO have commonly used devices in developing low-cost IoT-based soil moisture management interfaced using 
various sensors [30, 60, 75]. The sensor used is a capacitive type and transmits electricity without conduction; it 
can measure soil moisture changes by planting them into the soil and measuring its volumetric water content. The 
Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) sensor is a more precise option for measuring soil moisture, consisting of two 
metal rods embedded at the depth at which the humidity is to be measured. Works by sending pulses to the soil 
and then calculating the response of the soil as soil moisture content. Due to its good quality in measuring soil 
moisture, this TDR sensor is quite expensive to use in large-scale greenhouses [78, 79].

[80] proposed a soil moisture control system for measuring water content in soil at different soil depths, soil types, 
and air temperatures using various sensors integrated with Arduino UNO. The ESP8266 wireless module is then 
linked to the Arduino to upload data to the cloud server. A similar study by [81] succeeded in developing an IoT-
based field control system integrated with cloud-based data monitoring and analysis. The analysis results help 
predict water consumption for better crop yields. [82] approach to controlling soil moisture uses wireless technology 
utilizing GSM networks and push notifications to automate water supply for plants. A system proposed by [83] 
presents an Android application-based humidity monitoring method, where an Arduino interface sensor connected 
to Wi-Fi sends state data to a smartphone. Another monitoring approach is carried out by [60] using IoT and soil 
nutrient sensors to detect nutrient adequacy for plants. The decision support system then receives the data 
parameters and processes them as a farming decision. 
[84] implemented a user-friendly system, representing the soil moisture level with colors. These colors have helped 
farmers visually identify and manage soil moisture content without understanding the values displayed. Likewise, 
[85] proposed a soil nutrient control system that can manage the concentration of nutrients in the soil by planting 
sensors in the soil to map nutrient variability. Also, [86] developed an innovative device that uses a camera-
integrated drone for field mapping. Images are analyzed to generate soil moisture and nutrient values and use 
them for irrigation planning and scheduling. 
5 ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN IRRIGATION SYSTEM 
Artificial intelligence in intelligent irrigation systems was the subject of 25 papers. These studies concentrate on 
developing decision support systems, fuzzy logic models, and artificial neural network models that can take 
decisions automatically in response to changes in field conditions. The distribution of articles based on the theme 
of artificial intelligence is shown in Figure 5 below. 
 
Fig 5. Distribution of papers on artificial intelligence in irrigation system 
Artificial intelligence (AI) is a branch of science concerned with creating machines that can understand and act in 
the same way as humans. Machine learning is a burgeoning sub-domain of AI that explores patterns in large 
amounts of data [58, 87]. The popularity of machine learning is due to more and more data generated by various 
applications and IoT. The system can generate helpful information for making decisions or becoming input to other 
systems by studying data patterns. The need for agricultural products is directly proportional to the increase in the 
earth's population, so agroindustry and innovative agriculture technology get the spotlight in the industrial revolution 
4.0 [16, 46].  
AI has the potential to solve nonlinear, multiparameter, and time-varying problems in managing intelligent irrigation 
systems. By applying AI algorithms to specific problem areas, the system tries to imitate human logic, thought 
processes, and decision making through the application of Fuzzy Logic, Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest 
Neighbor (kNN), Decision Tree and Random Forest by using past data to feed AI and provides new knowledge to 
the system [58, 61]. [88] has researched by applying different regression and machine learning algorithms to 
several sensor datasets to develop weekly irrigation plan predictions. 
A study implementing an intelligent irrigation system shows many advantages, such as minimizing soil stress to 
changing microclimate conditions, efficient water use, and reducing human interaction. This solar panel-powered 
system has a Sensor Layer, Central Layer, and Valve Layer running together. The function of the Central Layer is 
to control the process that produces input (sensor layer detects moisture content) and output (valve layer opens to 
provide water). The system also enables fertilizers and pesticides by calibrating other sensors according to the 
required input [89].

make irrigation management decisions; this is where the decision support system (DSS) comes in [76, 90]. DSS 
has a framework that can represent complex systems with an efficient and robust approach that is easy to 
understand generates additional information and new perspectives to improve the quality of irrigation management. 
DSS is an information system that analyzes data and represents it to make decisions quickly. The primary purpose 
of DSS is to support and improve decision-making [28, 76]. Figure 6 shows a DSS logic diagram that consists of 
four connected components: Database, model base, knowledge base, and user interface. 
 
Fig 6. Block diagram of Decision Support System 
The Database in irrigation DSS collects and manages air temperature, relative humidity, crop water requirements, 
irrigation records, and solar radiation. The knowledge base has three parts: fact base, rule base, and inference 
engine used to analyze data, solve uncertain problems and draw conclusions. The model base creates optimization 
models, integrates numerous decision models, analyzes them to create crop water simulations, and offers farmers 
irrigation scheduling. [71, 76]. 
Developing and utilizing a decision support system in irrigation management is essential for scheduling water 
delivery based on crop needs. The main problem is how moist the soil is and how much water the plants need 
based on the type of plant, planting technique, availability of water, amount of fertilizer applied, microclimate 
conditions, and stage of plant development [91]. With DSS, farmers can manage their farms daily using plant 
databases and water supply strategies to perform irrigation calculations and fertilization adjustments to obtain 
optimal yields. There are times when a system has a crop suggestion feature that advises farmers to plant a crop 
that yields the highest profit under certain constraints [92]. 
The problem is that the characteristics of crops, soils, and microclimatic conditions in agriculture are dynamic and 
not linear, varying with seasons. Therefore, setting the proper irrigation schedule will directly influence plant growth. 
The core of DSS includes monitoring different parameters using different sensors and configuring their rules. DSS 
manages sensor readings stored in the cloud to adjust irrigation scheduling to maintain irrigation system efficiency 
routinely [76, 90]. An intelligent irrigation DSS must have the ability to adapt to changes in transient and spatial 
plant dynamics, such as uncertainties in microclimate conditions, nutrient requirements, and environmental 
changes. Researchers have proposed many studies on DSS applied to irrigation systems, such as [93], who 
developed an automated irrigation system using a single lateral pipe covering a large area to manage water at 
varying speeds. 
Sprinkler irrigation developed by [94] uses an automatic linear moving sprinkler system with WSN based DSS. The 
system can adapt to crop types, irrigation requirements, and planting locations to command individual sprinkler 
heads how and where water must be applied. Similarly, [76] built a DSS integrated fertigation simulator for 
designing drip or sprinkler irrigation for on-site olives and grapes farms. The system has a database, simulation 
model, and user interface that shows the ranking of design alternatives through multicriteria decision-making 
(MCDM). The scope of the calculation of this system includes land analysis, water requirements, and plant 
nutrition.

5.2 
Fuzzy Logic Model 
A fuzzy logic model is a data-driven technique with easy-to-understand logical rules. [50, 68, 95] proposed a fuzzy 
logic-based irrigation scheduling by enforcing control rules to microclimate data, evaporation data, and soil 
conditions. The process flow can be seen in Figure 7. 
[96] succeeded in building and testing a rule-based Fuzzy Logic application to assess the water stress index of 
plants in a greenhouse; the application accepts three input variables, namely air temperature, solar radiation, and 
water pressure. Results show that Fuzzy Logic eliminates the need for air aerodynamic resistance data, making 
this system more straightforward. 
[95] developed fuzzy logic using the LabVIEW application to create a graphical user interface (GUI) for a drip 
irrigation control system in a greenhouse. The input parameters used are air temperature and soil moisture and 
process them using fuzzy rules to produce information of irrigation duration. The test results show that fuzzy logic 
control can efficiently estimate irrigation schedules in an automated system, and greenhouse managers can 
monitor real-time data and devices that are easy to manage, even for ordinary users. [97] research also designed 
an irrigation control based on fuzzy logic applying the Penman-Monteith equation for rice cultivation with a 
parameter model in the difference between actual and target evapotranspiration following the plant growth phase. 
Each phase has its water requirement. The research aims to develop an intelligent system that helps irrigation 
management and produces a system that can work better than conventional irrigation systems. The results showed 
that the control system saves water, improves irrigation performance, improves crop quality, and saves labor.  
 
Fig 7. Fuzzy Logic-based Intelligent Irrigation System 
Also, [50] developed a fuzzy logic system that evaluates the irrigation system based on the variable availability of 
irrigation water during the planting period on the level of farmers' income which results in the efficiency of the 
irrigation system performance. To assist in making decisions on irrigation distribution. [98] conducted similar 
research by developing an intelligent irrigation system to turn on and off the irrigation system using input 
parameters of water use, water and air temperature, and soil moisture. They implement WSN-based monitoring to 
send data on fuzzy logic, which then performs irrigation scheduling by applying fuzzy rules. The system can 
maintain soil moisture content at the specified limit to save the use of electrical energy, water, and runoff. 
5.3 
Artificial Neural Network Model 
One application of AI in agriculture is Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) algorithms, which can predict using elements 
interconnected and work in parallel. The advantage of neural networks is that they can be trained, for example, to 
distinguish grass from rice or to compare tomatoes to peppers [71]. The ANN system can predict with high 
accuracy when fed reliable and precise data. A trained ANN is considered an expert in a category of data. This 
expert can then predict possible future conditions and prepare what-if scenarios [73, 87]. Other advantages of ANN 
are (1) Adaptive learning, the ability to learn and carry out tasks based on the data provided, (2) Self-organization, 
the system can independently compile and build information representations during the learning process, and (3) 
Real-time operations, computations are carried out in parallel, so it is faster to get calculation results [99]. 
The ANN model is a simple model consisting of three primary neurons distributed in the input layer, multiples of the 
hidden layer, and the output layer. ANN development requires necessary basic steps, namely datasets, ANN 
model training data, and ANN model test data for evaluation. Using quality data, the ANN model has a mechanism 
for self-study and solving complex problems. Input neurons receive parameters, then hidden neurons perform 
665

computations, and output neurons send signals to other network layers; and interconnect neurons using linear and 
nonlinear functions [26, 87, 99, 100]. 
The following Figure 8 shows the ANN process flow. In general, the use of ANN includes problem-solving in system 
optimization, process control, pattern classification, forecasting, and prediction. The main components of an ANN 
model consist of neuron nodes, a hidden layer containing weights between parameters and distribution rules to 
generate information for learning rules and independent learning skills through experience. There are two types of 
ANN models based on their input choices: feed-forward and feed-backward networks [99]. 
 
Fig 8. The flow of feed-forward artificial neurons 
Evapotranspiration is essential information that needs to be known to optimize plant growth, especially in water 
management and sustainable irrigation systems. Knowledge of the parameters of air temperature, relative 
humidity, wind speed, hours of sunshine, and latitude can optimize the management of ET0 in a greenhouse [97]. 
ANN research on intelligent irrigation systems is applied to scheduling and irrigation discharge to achieve savings 
in irrigation water use. [87] conducted a study to estimate the value of soil moisture in rice farming land using 
minimal micro and macro climate data by applying two ANN models. The first model predicts the value of ET0 
using the minimum, maximum and average air temperature variables. The second model does the same thing but 
uses air temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation. The test results show that both models produce reliable and 
accurate soil moisture estimates. 
A study by [101] has developed an ANN model to calculate evapotranspiration (ET0). After testing, they concluded 
that the ANN model predicts evapotranspiration better than the conventional ET0 equation. Similarly, [90] 
developed an ANN to calculate ET0 and compared it with the Penman-FAO equation and Penman-Monteith model 
using four and six microclimate variables as inputs. The test indicates that the three models provide accurate 
results using six input parameters. In contrast, the test results with four parameters show that only the ANN model 
can accurately predict the ET0 value. This research shows that building an ANN model is possible even with limited 
microclimate data.  
In addition, irrigation control system automation was also proposed by [102] using the ANN cluster and closed-loop 
control, which resulted in better performance than time-based irrigation control. However, they did not provide 
information regarding the irrigation method used and the percentage of water savings. [100] developed an 
intelligent irrigation system for evapotranspiration using the ANN model and a photovoltaic system to predict 
irrigation scheduling based on cropping moisture distribution data; this study reported better daily water and 
electrical energy savings also better crop yields. The application of ANN in irrigation water management has also 
discussed prediction of water salinity, water quality, rain runoff, and forecasting of surface irrigation infiltration,  
[73] proposed two ANN models to predict Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) and Dissolved Oxygen (DO) for 
irrigation water originating from rivers; the conclusion is that water quality management in other areas can also use 
this ANN model. Similarly, [103] uses the ANN model to design an intelligent system to manage water systems for 
agriculture and fisheries. [104] explained that the greenhouse environment has dynamic and complex 
characteristics, making it difficult to use conventional control methods as a solution. Radial Basis Function Neural 
Networks (RBF) algorithm and nonlinear adaptive controllers become solutions to control greenhouse microclimate. 
[74] discusses the use of ANN in drip irrigation systems to predict the distribution of subsurface irrigation water. 
The development of the ANN is to model the continuous wetting pattern after the water droplets from the emitter 
touch the ground surface. 
6 FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES 
This review explored the various studies and progress to improve irrigation water use efficiency, nutrient 
optimization, and crop yields. The aim is to improve and increase food availability by implementing IoT-based 
monitoring and control on agricultural land, especially greenhouses. The review results show that researchers and

farmers can maximize the use of the latest IoT technologies for environmental conditions monitoring, data-driven 
control, and artificial intelligence. Nowadays, there is an increase in research that develops techniques and models 
for developing irrigation control systems. The trend is due to the emergence of various sensors and controls on the 
market; this provides vast opportunities for the development of precision agriculture, especially for making 
intelligent predictions of agricultural processes such as crop yields, crop water requirements, and microclimate 
conditions. Researchers also need to explore other factors that influence irrigation scheduling planning, especially 
in large agricultural areas, because researchers generally conduct studies on a laboratory scale. Research from 
different perspectives will enrich intelligent irrigation systems and result in inaccurate predictions that can advise 
farmers regarding their farming activities and notify them when anomalies occur. 
Furthermore, researchers need to test various control systems in the irrigation systems discussed, focus on 
adaptive control, and combine it with real-time monitoring. It is essential to build systems that can adapt to dynamic 
parameters of microclimate, soil, and plant. At the same time, ensure the intelligent irrigation system runs optimally. 
In addition, it is essential to develop intelligent irrigation systems that are increasingly complex and digital-based so 
that the technology is suitable, affordable, and stable for smallholders. The hope is to increase water use efficiency 
and solve water scarcity. 
7 CONCLUSION 
Limited water has become the biggest challenge for farmers, and efficiency must solve water scarcity in irrigation 
management. The main objective is to control the amount and frequency of irrigation so that the amount of water 
received by plants is sufficient to keep the root zone moist. Farmers who are generally ignorant about the 
complexity of optimal irrigation management need a system that can facilitate big data processing analysis tools 
and transmit quality information quickly and efficiently. The system must be able to provide recommendations 
according to the conditions of the agricultural environment to increase the experience and decision-making of 
farmers. 
This problem challenges researchers to increase efforts to develop sophisticated monitoring and control strategies 
for intelligent farming that minimize irrigation water use. This review draws on previous relevant studies on 
agriculture water saving. The review results describe research trends in intelligent irrigation systems monitoring 
and control strategies and assess research opportunities to ensure water availability and savings. We hope this 
review provides insight and inspiration for researchers to continue research on irrigation monitoring and control to 
achieve food security and water savings.

With the increase of population, frequent changes in climatic conditions and limited resources, it becomes a challenging task to fulfil the food requirement of the present population. Precision agriculture also known as smart farming have emerged as an innovative tool to address current challenges in agricultural sustainability. The mechanism that drives this cutting edge technology is machine learning (ML). It gives the machine ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. ML together with IoT (Internet of Things) enabled farm machinery are key components of the next agriculture revolution. In this article, authors present a systematic review of ML applications in the field of agriculture. The areas that are focused are prediction of soil parameters such as organic carbon and moisture content, crop yield prediction, disease and weed detection in crops and species detection. ML with computer vision are reviewed for the classification of a different set of crop images in order to monitor the crop quality and yield assessment. This approach can be integrated for enhanced livestock production by predicting fertility patterns, diagnosing eating disorders, cattle behaviour based on ML models using data collected by collar sensors, etc. Intelligent irrigation which includes drip irrigation and intelligent harvesting techniques are also reviewed that reduces human labour to a great extent.

Introduction The population of the world will increase to 9.1 billion approximately thirty-four percent as of today by the end of 2050. Food requirement will increase by 70 percent and due to rapid urbanization, land availability for agriculture will decrease drastically in the coming years. India will be the most populated country by 2050 and presently it is already lagging the domestic food production. The main reason for reduced food production is the lack of planning, unpredictable weather conditions, improper harvesting and irrigation techniques and livestock mismanagement. In the last few years, nature has experienced a drastic change in weather conditions due to global warming. The average temperature of the earth has been increased due to which there is uncertainty in climatic conditions. Frequent droughts, heavy rainfall are the biggest challenge for poor farmers. According to the government of India annual economic survey, adverse climatic conditions, reduce the farmer’s income by 20-25%. Precision agriculture [1], [2] is one of the solutions to ensure food security for the entire world [3]. Precision agriculture also abbreviated as digital agriculture is a technology-enabled data-driven sustainable farm management system. It is basically the adoption of modern information technologies, software tools, and smart embedded devices for decision support in agriculture [4] as shown in figure 1. Mechanized agriculture and the green revolution are the two key components of the first and second agriculture revolution. Precision farming is an important part of the third agriculture revolution [5]. FIGURE 1. Precision agriculture. Show All John Deere introduced this technology in 1990 for the sowing of seeds and spraying of fertilizers using global positioning system (GPS) controlled tractors. The main focus of precision farming is to reduce the production cost and environmental effects to increase the farm’s profitability. Digital technologies such as IoT [6], AI, data analytics, cloud computing, and block-chain technology play a key role in precision agriculture. In precision farming, IoT based smart sensors are deployed in the agriculture land for collecting data related to soil nutrients, fertilizers, and water requirements as well as for analysing the crop growth. Autonomous and semi-autonomous devices such as an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) [7] and robots are used for identifying weed and disease in the plants using computer vision techniques. Satellite images are also used in precision agriculture for monitoring the field and identifying the diseases in the plants. The data obtained from the deployed sensors [8] are processed and analyzed using ML algorithms to make farming practice more controlled and optimized. ML algorithms are also used for weather and rainfall prediction based on the data obtained from sensors, climatic records, and satellite images. This could save the lives of thousands of farmers who commit suicide because of crop loss due to uncertainty in weather conditions. Smart livestock management is an important component of precision agriculture. It helps in monitoring the health, welfare, productivity, and reproduction of animals throughout their life cycle. Sensors and cameras monitor animal’s health and computer vision techniques help in making intelligent decisions such as stopping the communal spread of diseases. Autonomous tractors and automated irrigation systems provide modern farming solutions to farmers. The widespread utilization of precision farming across the world is due to the presence of innovative machine and deep learning (DL) algorithms, high-speed internet access, and efficient computational devices. In [10] authors have discussed applications of ML for sustainable agriculture supply chain (ASC) performance. Authors have presented a unique ML-ASC framework that can guide researchers and agriculture practitioners to understand the role and importance of digital technologies in the agriculture industry. In [11] authors reviewed different ML applications in agriculture and discussed how digital technologies will benefit the agriculture industry. In this paper, the authors have presented a comprehensive review of the ML application for precision agriculture. This review article will provide an insight into the research community about the adoption of digital practices in the agriculture management system. It is anticipated that government agencies will frame policies to promote precision farming across the world. The main contribution of the article is outlined as follows: Applications of artificial intelligence and IoT in precision agriculture are discussed along with their practical implications.

TABLE 1 Key Differences of the Article With Published Articles SECTION II. Impact of Artificial Intelligence and IoT in Agriculture The term AI was first coined in the Dartmouth conference in the year 1956 by John McCarthy and he defined it as a science and engineering of making intelligent machines or more specifically intelligent computer programs. AI technology provides computational intelligence to machines so that they can learn, understand and react according to the situation. ML, DL, natural language processing (NLP), swarm intelligence (SI), expert systems, fuzzy logic, and computer vision are the subfields of AI as shown in figure 2. This field finds endless applications across different sectors of human life. Intelligent AI programs are widely explored in health-care, agriculture, finance, robotics, e-commerce and the automation industry. Samsung, Apple, and other electronics giant companies announced that they will be utilizing this technology in every device they will manufacture in the near future. IoT is another emerging technology in which smart sensors, devices are interconnected through the internet. These smart sensors can be utilized to gather data across different disciplines such as solar plants, agriculture fields, disaster-prone areas, manufacturing industry for efficient resource utilization. With the increase in population over the year’s demand for agriculture products is increasing day by day. However, with limited land availability for farming and reduce interest among the young generation to adopt farming as their profession, it has become a challenging task for the agriculture industry to satisfy the food requirement of millions of people. Now, the agriculture industry is widely adopting smart technologies like IoT and AI to efficiently cultivate organic products in limited land areas as well as to overcome the traditional challenges of farmers. FIGURE 2. Artificial intelligence techniques. Show All IoT based smart farming system is built for monitoring soil nutrients and soil moisture using sensors. ML algorithms are explored for determining the optimum amount of fertilizers required for soils before the sowing of crops. Drones are revolutionizing the agriculture industry. These drones are cameras enabled and are used for different applications such as field and crop monitoring, spraying of pesticides, and drip irrigation. The images captured by the drones over the entire lifecycle of crops can be examined using DL and computer vision algorithms for disease and weed identification. Thereafter, these drones are used for spraying pesticides over the weeds and infected crops. Over the years uncertainty in weather conditions is the main concern of farmers. Drip irrigation using drones is an efficient AI-empowered irrigation system which is basically trained on weather pattern and can effectively reduce the water problems of farmers. AI-enabled robots can be used for harvesting the crops at a much faster pace and in large volumes. Robots can reduce human labour to a large extent and can be used along with drones for monitoring the field. Livestock management is another major concern for farmers. IoT based sensors can be deployed in the field for health monitoring of cattle. This information can be utilized for protecting the bunch of cattle from diseased cattle. NLP based virtual assistant applications like chatbots can update the farmers with the latest advancement in technologies for agriculture. Farmers can finds solutions for their problems and incorporate the latest technology in their farming for improving their field productivity. Thus, AI and IoT are the two major technologies that will play a vital role in the agriculture industry. SECTION III. Machine Learning Algorithms ML is the subfield of computer science that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. (Arthur Samuel, 1959) [12]. Alan Turing in the year 1950 proposed the concept of learning machines and wrote a research article “The Turing Test for Machine Intelligence” [13]. He performed a test and examined the machine’s ability to demonstrate intelligent behaviour similar to humans. A machine or intelligent computer program learns and extract knowledge from the data, builds a framework for making predictions or intelligent decisions. Thus, the ML process is divided into three key parts, i.e. data input, model building, and generalization as shown in figure 3. Generalization is the process for predicting the output for the inputs with which the algorithm has not been trained before. ML algorithms are mainly used to solve complex problems where human expertise fails such as weather prediction, spam filtering, disease identification in plants, pattern recognition. FIGURE 3. A Machine learning process. Show All Today, due to the availability of innovative algorithms and large data sets through internet resources industries and research communities are widely using ML algorithms for solving a diverse set of problems. DL is the subfield of the family of ML algorithms which is trained from large sets and uses an artificial neural network (ANN) to make intelligent decisions. ML algorithms are categorized as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning as shown in figure 4. Supervised learning as the name suggests is learning with the supervisor or teacher. This set of algorithms works with labeled data-set which means corresponding to each input there are outputs. The algorithm builds an input-output relationship with this labeled data set and thereafter generalize or predicts outputs for unseen inputs. Supervised learning algorithms used for predicting the categorical value are known as classification algorithms and the algorithms that are used for predicting the numerical value are known as regression algorithms. Unsupervised learning algorithms works with unlabelled data and discovers unknown objects by grouping similar objects. The goal of an unsupervised learning algorithm is to extract hidden knowledge from the training data set thus this approach is difficult to implement than supervised learning algorithms. Reinforcement learning is another approach that learns from the environment through reward and punishment. AlphaGo, a chess-playing game developed by DeepMind utilized reinforcement learning for defeating the world’s best chess-playing computer program. FIGURE 4. Categorization of machine learning algorithms. Show All In this paper the performance of different ML algorithms are analysed and discussed in the field of agriculture. Table 2 presents different types of supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning algorithms utilized for soil and weather prediction, disease and weed identification, intelligent irrigation and harvesting techniques as well as livestock management. TABLE 2 Machine Learning Algorithms SECTION IV. Machine Learning Applications in Precision Agriculture In many countries, the farmers rely on the traditional ways of farming which is based on the reliability of the suggestions from the elderly and their experience. This method leaves farmers at the mercy of random climatic conditions which are already getting random due to global warming and uneven rainfall patterns. The manual spraying method for pesticides led to improper usage of resources and harms the environment. AI and IoT enabled precision agriculture removes the randomness and assist new age farmer to optimize every step of the farming process. Figure 5 (a) and (b) presents a pictorial view of traditional agriculture and technology enabled farm management system. FIGURE 5. (a) Traditional agriculture cycle (b) Precision agriculture cycle. Show All Gaitán [14] provided a systematic study of the impact of extreme weather events, such as hail events, cold waves, heat waves, and their impact on agricultural practices. The author reported floods, droughts, frost, hail, heatwaves, and pest outbreaks are impacted by climatic conditions. The AI systems are applicable in each farming operation as depicted in figure 4 and some of them even extend beyond the conventionally recognized steps. In this section we will discuss the state of art techniques proposed/implemented by various researchers and practitioners worldwide. A. Soil Properties and Weather Prediction Prediction of soil properties is the first and the most crucial step which influences the selection of crop, land preparation, selection of seed, crop yield, and selection of fertilizers /manure. The soil properties are directly related to the geographic and climatic conditions of the land in use and hence is an important factor to take into consideration. The soil properties prediction mostly consists of predicting nutrients in the soil, soil surface humidity, weather conditions during the lifecycle of the crop. Human activities have highly affected the properties of soil and hence our ability to cultivate the crops [15]. In general, there are 17 essential elements as listed in table 3 which play an important role in plant growth [16]. The growth of crops depends on the nutrients available in a particular soil. The soil nutrients are mostly monitored by electric and electromagnetic sensors [8]. Depending on the nutrients farmers make informed decisions as to which crop is optimal for the land. However, the nutrients can be added through fertilizers, manure, etc. but with an additional cost. Some of them may also damage the environment and have an adverse effect on the soil cycle. TABLE 3 Essential Plant Nutrients [2] A scientific analysis of soil nutrients, soil moisture, pH is important for determining the soil properties. Acar et al. [17] employed an extreme learning machine (ELM) based regression model for prediction of soil surface humidity. The author selected two terrains having area 4 KM2 and 16 KM2 located in Dicle university campus for experimental analysis. The real-time field data was extracted using polarimetric Radarsat-2 data, which was pre-processed using the SNAP toolbox [18] and features were added with the help of local measurements by separating the field into square grids. Once the pre-processing and feature extraction is done the data is passed to ELM based regression model to predict the soil surface humidity. The algorithm was tested with 5 different kernel functions and the prediction was validated using leave-one-out cross-validation technique. The experimental results confirmed the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.19% when using ‘sine’ kernel function. Wang et al. [19] deployed soft sensors based on ELM for the measurement of nutrient solution composition in the soilless cultivation method. The soilless cultivation method is an emerging planting method. It is imperative to monitor the pH value, temperature and concentration changes in nutrient solution composition as the performance of soilless cultivation is highly dependent on these parameters. The significant variables in a nutrient solution cannot be measured directly hence these are determined with the help of auxiliary variables. The authors utilized conductivity, pH value, flow rate, and temperature measurements for auxiliary measurements. These auxiliary measurements are fed to a deep belief network-based ELM which predicts the values of significant variables. For experimental analysis, the authors deployed the model to measure the concentration of SO 2− 4 , and H 2 PO − 4 in a nutrient solution. The authors reported an average RMSE of 1.2414 for predictions in SO 2− 4 and RMSE of 0.8892 for prediction of H 2 PO − 4 . Park et al. [20] utilized ML algorithms to predict the soil moisture using data from MODIS. The authors downscaled the AMSR2 soil moisture to 1KM using random forest (RF) and Cubist algorithms. An ensemble of these algorithms was used to obtain soil moisture data. The results obtained through the ML methods were compared with the statistical ordinary least squares technique. The ML model exhibited a R 2 (coefficient of determination) of 0.96 and an RMSE of 0.06, whereas a R 2 of 0.47 and a RMSE of 0.16 was associated with the statistical ordinary least squares. Reda et al. [21] explored ML algorithms to estimate soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) in soil samples collected from four agricultural lands of Moroccan. Data set of near-infrared spectroscopy is utilized in comparison to traditional chemical methods as this technique reduces the computation time and resource utilization. The ensemble learning modeling algorithm presents the best performance among other regression models and back-propagation neural networks (BPNN) algorithm. The proposed algorithm presents R 2 of 0.96, RMSE of 1.92, performance to deviation (RPD) of 4.87 for SOC and R 2 of 0.94 and RMSE of 0.57, RPD of 4.91 for TN prediction. Morellos et al. [22] also utilized visible and infrared spectroscopy to determine TN, SOC, and moisture content (MC) in the arable field in Premslin Germany. Spectroscopy dataset is used for building the predictive ML model for estimating all three soil properties. Least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) and cubist ML algorithms outperform principal component regression and partial least square regression multivariate methods in terms of RMSE and residual prediction deviation (RPD). LS-SVM best predict SOC and MC with RMSE of 0.062 and 0.457, RPD of 2.24, and 2.20. Cubist best predicts for TN with RMSE of 0.071 and RPD of 1.96. Andrade et al. [23] build ordinary least square regression, RF, cubist regression, XGboost prediction model for determining soil properties from portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) spectrometry dataset in Brazilian coastal plains. Three soil properties total nitrogen, soil organic matter (SOM), cation exchange capacity (CEC) were analyzed using RF, ordinary least squares regression (OLS), cubist regression (CR), XGBoost (XGB). RF algorithm gives the best performance with R 2 of 0.50 for TN, R 2  0.75 for CEC and 0.56 for SOM. Deiss et al. [24] estimated the soil properties (clay, sand, pH, SOC) in northern Tanzania and USA Midwest from the spectroscopy dataset using ML algorithms. THE tuned SVM model outperforms the partial least square (PLS) regression model in terms of predicting all the soil parameters. Mahmoudzadeh et al. [25] explored the ML algorithm to predict SOC in the Kurdistan province of Iran. The simulation results suggest that RF accurately predicts SOC with R 2 of 0.60 and RMSE of 0.35% in comparison to SVM, kNN, Cubist, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) ML algorithm. The study also suggests that air temperature, annual rainfall, valley depth, texture of terrain surface are some of the important factors that influence SOC spread over the Kurdistan region. Veres et al. [26] explored DL architecture such as CNN for predicting the soil properties from the infra-red spectroscopy dataset. Benke et al. [27] predict soil electrical conductivity (EC) and SOC in different regional locations of Victoria, Australia using pedotransfer function (PTF) based on ML algorithm. PTF basically converts soil measurement into soil properties and provides inputs for ML simulation algorithms. In the proposed approach PTF use Generalised Linear Mixed Effects Model (GLMM) model and Residual Maximum Likelihood (REML) to predict‘ the soil properties. Traditional approaches to soil properties and crop yield prediction require time-consuming field surveys and the deployment of expensive sensors. Khanal et al. [28] proposed an alternative approach in which the dataset for the prediction of soil properties and crop yield is generated using remotely sensed aerial images of agricultural land. Five soil properties, viz. pH value, magnesium (Mg), potassium (K), SOM, CEC, and crop yield were predicted using RF, SVM, Cubist, NN, Gradient Boosting Model (GBM) ML algorithms. NN presents the highest prediction accuracy for SOM having R 2 of 0.64, RMSE of 0.44 and CEC having R 2 of 0.67, RMSE of 2.35; SVM best predicts K having R 2 of 0.21, RMSE of 0.49 and Mg having R 2 of 0.22, RMSE of 4.57; and GBM best predicts pH having R 2 of 0.15, RMSE of 0.62. RF outperforms other algorithms in terms of crop yield prediction and presents higher accuracy having R 2 of 0.53 and RMSE of 0.97. Labrador et al. [29] estimate calcium and Mg content in soil using generalized regression NN and genetic algorithm (GA). The digital elevation model and satellite images were used as input to the prediction model for estimating the soil properties. Chlingaryan et al. [30] discussed different ML approaches used in precision agriculture for accurate crop yield prediction and soil nitrogen estimation over the last fifteen years. Ju-Young et al. [31] investigated a seasonal climatic forecasting model using regularized ELM to predict day-wise mean air temperature at field level for a period of 90 days. The authors selected data from Korea Metrological Administration using the Met GloSea5GC2 model [32]. The authors fed 240 days of forecast data and hindcast data from the ensemble based model to the RELM algorithm. The algorithm performance was evaluated by measuring: RMSE, mean absolute error (MAE) the model prediction vs the actual values. The authors achieved an RMSE in the range of 1.02 to 3.35 which outperformed the meteorological data which has an RMSE range of 1.61 to 3.37. Soil moisture content is an important parameter to acknowledge in the agriculture industry as it addresses precise irrigation scheduling. Stamenkovic et al. [33] build a support vector regression (SVR) prediction model to predict soil moisture content from remotely sensed hyperspectral images. Song et al. [34] proposed a macroscopic cellular automata (MCA) model and combined its deep belief network (DBN) to predict soil moisture content over a cornfield in northwest china. The simulation results of DBN-MCA outperforms the multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-MCA in terms of RMSE. Acheing [35] explored the SVR model (i.e. RBF), ANN, DNN for simulating soil water retention curve (SWRC) curve of loamy sand. Dataset of loamy sand subjected to wetting and drying condition is collected using a reflectometer and tensiometer. RBF based SVR model best predicts SWRC under both wet and dry conditions. Feng et al. [36] estimate soil temperature at various soil depths of Loess Plateau of China. Four different ML algorithms ELM, generalized regression neural networks (GRNN), backpropagation neural networks (BPNN), and RF were investigated for predicting the soil temperature. ML algorithms were trained with air temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, and vapour pressure and solar radiation as input parameters and the simulations show that ELM outperforms other ML algorithms in terms of RMSE, MAE, Nash–Sutcliffe coefficient (NS) and concordance correlation coefficient. Mohammadi et al. [37] explored ELM for predicting daily dew point temperature in different parts of Iran. This part of the world experience different climatic conditions throughout the year. The proposed model accurately predicts dew point temperature than SVM and ANN algorithms. Zhu et al. [38] accurately predict daily evapotranspiration in Northwest China using hybrid particle swarm optimization (PSO)-ELM model to optimize crop water requirement in agriculture. Alizamir et al. [39] accurately predicts soil temperature at different depths of 5, 10, 50 and 100 cm using ELM, ANN, classification and regression trees, group method of data handling using dataset obtained from Mersin station operated by Turkish Meteorological Service. The simulation results suggest that soil temperature can be estimated easily using air temperature upto depth of 50 cm while for depth of 100 cm additional information of solar radiation and wind speed is required. Rainfall prediction plays a critical role in the water resource management system, flood risk assessment, and the agriculture industry. Acknowledging the chaotic nature of rainfall, it is very difficult for statistical approaches to accurately predict the rainfall. Cramer et al. [40] evaluated the performance of seven ML algorithms for rainfall prediction. The statistical results show that the radial-basis function neural network (RBFNN) shows the best performance among other state of the art algorithms. Sierra and Jesus [41] predicted the rainfall in Tenerife, an island in Spain based on atmospheric synoptic patterns using different ML algorithms and found NN gave the best performance among other ML algorithms. Kamatchi and Parvathi [42] employed NN for weather prediction and proposed a hybrid recommender system for enhancing the success ratio of the system. Lazri et al. [43] build a multi-classifier model for estimating precipitation using MSG images (Meteosat second generation) and dataset obtained using radar. The proposed approach shows that the proposed multi-classifier improves the standard of classification. Shardoor and Rao [44] surveyed three different approaches i.e. ML techniques, data mining techniques, and satellite forecasting techniques for rainfall prediction. Table 4 presents a comparative study of different ML algorithms for prediction of soil properties and weather prediction. TABLE 4 Different ML Algorithms for Prediction of Soil Properties and Weather Conditions B. Crop Yield Prediction A significant piece of information for any farmer is the prediction of crop yield and how the yield can be increased. pH value, soil type, and quality, weather pattern: temperature, rainfall, humidity, sunshine hours, fertilizers, and harvesting schedules are some of the parameters which play an important role in predicting the crop yield [45]. Scientifically manual farming can be considered as a feedback control system in which the corrective action is taken once a setback in a crop is observed. The crop yield will highly depend on the efficiency of the optimal utilization of the above-mentioned resources. If some kind of anomaly goes undetected in the initial stage may harm the crop yield in an unprecedented way. Singh et al. [46] assessed hailstorms on India’s wheat production and observes that in February and March 2015 alone the hailstorm events caused a decline of 8.4% in national wheat production. For financially weak farmers in a country such as India, where intermittent storage of harvested crops is a rare resource, accurate weather predictions may turn to be miraculous for farmers. ML models when systematically applied to a system act as feedforward control. With the help of accurate ML models, we can anticipate the factors which are going to affect the crop yield. Hence the corrective action can be taken before even an anomaly hits the crop production. Kamir et al. [47] used ML models to identify the yield gap hotspots in wheat production. Authors generated very high-resolution yield maps using data from various sources between 2009 and 2015. The data was collected from various sources:(a) NDVI time-series data across Australia using the MOD13Q1 data set [48], (b) rainfall and temperature data were collected from historic climate data at Australia bureau of metrology, (c) maps for observed grain yield were collected at source using intelligent harvesting machines. The dataset generated were tested with 9 ML algorithms: RF, XGBoost, Cubist, MLP, SVR, Gaussian Process, k-NN, and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines. The authors combined predictions from each of the algorithms into ensembles for prediction optimization [49]. Out of these algorithms, SVR with RBFNN outperformed other algorithms and investigators were able to achieve the yield estimate with an R 2  of 0.77 and an RMSE value of 0.55t ha −1 . The results were validated using 10-fold cross-validation techniques applied to the full data set. Aghighi et al. [50] used various advanced regression algorithms to predict the yield of silage maize crops.

Disease and Weed Detection Disease fungi, microorganisms, and bacteria take their energy from the plants they live on, which in turn affects the crop yield. If not detected at the right time may account for a huge economic loss to farmers. A lot of financial burden goes to a farmer in the form of pesticides, to get rid of diseases and restore the functioning of crops. Excessive use of pesticides also leads to environmental damage and the effects of the water and soil cycle of the agricultural land. Using an optimally designed AI system during crop growth period not only reduces the risk of crop disease and minimizes the economic impact, but it also results in minimizing the adverse impact of unsystematic farming on the environment.

Drip Irrigation In the modern era, irrigation for crops has been improvised using the concept of drip irrigation [100], where the system consists of thin plastic tubes placed in or above the soil along the vertical rows of the plants for nurturing the water supply to the crops. Employing the proper operational management of drip irrigation, minimizes the utilization of water supply for crop production, and provides a better yield of crops. Socio-economic and environmental demands have widely appreciated in use of drip irrigation on farmlands for agriculture, especially for the high cost valued crops i.e., vegetables and fruits. Furthermore, drip irrigation is based on the low-pressure watering system in comparison to sprinkler systems; this makes the system more efficient in terms of energy consumption [101]. Various advantages have been observed using drip irrigation in agriculture over other irrigation systems which include sub-irrigation systems or sprinkler irrigation systems. These advantages are entitled to minimal usage of water supply, usage of soluble fertilizers through a drip irrigation system, automated system, minimization of soil erosion, uninterrupted activities, minimized weed problems, facilitation of double-cropping. Precision irrigation is another innovative approach in intelligent farming where it uses the water intelligently that further helps the farmers to achieve better yield in crops with minimal water usage. It can also be featured as providing the right amount of water, at the right time and the right place in the field. It focuses its implementation based on variable rate irrigation (VRI) methods employing drips or sprinklers. [102]–[104]. Advancements in the field of on-farm sensor technologies, weather forecasting, IoT based sensor detection system of vegetation and precision-based smart irrigation produces a huge size of data that ultimately benefits the farmers in optimizing the usage of water resources, improve the yield of crops and maximizes the profit of farmers [105]. ML and DL and reinforcement learning are employed on the historical data and it provides various opportunities for real-time prediction and decision making purposes for smart irrigation which are solely based on the data collected by the sensors and IoT enabled systems [106]–[109]. Roberts et al. [110] have discussed that a sensor-based control system might create some bottleneck in terms of reducing the reliability of decision support tools on process-based crop models, which further may require costly calibration and affect in generating an uncertain representation of soil-plant-atmosphere processes. Further, ML techniques have been employed extremely well for protection analysis of hydrological processes i.e., soil moisture and groundwater levels [111], [112]. Li et al. [113] utilized ANN for estimating nitrate distribution in different types of soils under a drip irrigation system. Kavianand et al. [114] proposed a fully automated drip irrigation system based on the ARM9 processor along with different kinds of sensors equipped for monitoring the PH content and nitrogen content of the soil and controlling the irrigation of the field. Emmanuel et al. [115] establishes an experimental set-up in a greenhouse in Malaysia to monitor the growth of mustard leaf vegetable plants through IoT devices and alongside developed a data-driven model of drip irrigation system. Soil moisture, irrigation volume, evapotranspiration were measured through sensors and were given to the Raspberry Pi 3 controller for storing it in the cloud. This data was utilized by different predictive models ARX, BJ, and state-space models to predict soil moisture content for an optimized drip irrigation system. ARX model outperforms other predictive models in terms of MSE and response time. Seyedzadeh et al. [116] explored ML algorithms to optimize the uniform emitter discharge rate of drip irrigation system under varying pressure and temperature conditions. In this model operating pressure, water temperature, discharge coefficient, pressure exponent, and nominal discharge were taken as input parameters while ration of emitter discharge to nominal discharge is taken as output temperature. Authors explored four different ML algorithms for optimizing emitter discharge rate and simulation results show that LS-SVM presents best results with the least error of mean absolute error. Peng et al. [117] utilize soil moisture, soil electrical conductivity, air temperature, and light intensity parameters to build an optimized irrigation prediction model using backpropagation NN in China. The proposed prediction model presents good results with MSE of 0.00857724. The authors also identified an optimized layout and network arrangement for pipe in a drip irrigation system using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software. The simulation results present that the H-shaped network layout is more suitable for field crop irrigation than the comb-shaped and fish bone-shaped layout. Drip irrigation system gives the best performance when the wetting front dimension, i.e. diameter, depth, and upward movement are optimized. Shiri et al. [118] explored soft-computing approaches viz., gene expressions programming (GEP), and RF techniques in modeling wetting front dimensions over different soil types for surface and sub-surface irrigation system. Proposed model, best predicts ETc with an improved correlation coefficient and decreases MSE and MAE.

Goumopoulos et al. [124] proposed a real-time adaptable intelligent and autonomous closed-loop irrigation management system. The authors built an experimental set-up in a greenhouse and deployed wireless sensors for monitoring the plant growth and environmental conditions along with plant growth control actuators. Estimation of evapotranspiration (ETc) plays a vital role in water resource management system. Chen et al. [125] estimate crop actual ETc from temporal convolution network (TCN) from the dataset of lysimeters for maize under drip irrigation with film mulch. Simulation results show that the proposed model best predicts ETc with an improved correlation coefficient and decreases MSE and MAE. Table 7 presents a comparative study of different ML algorithms for drip irrigation. TABLE 7 Different ML Algorithms for Drip Irrigation E. Livestock Production and Management Livestock production is basically related to the production and management of cattle i.e., sheep, pigs, etc. for human consumption in terms of meat. Livestock production and their management are based on the farming parameters of these cattle i.e., health, food, nutrition, and behaviour to optimize their production in such a way that the economic efficiency of this livestock can be maximized. In the present scenario, Artificial intelligence, IoT and Blockchain technologies [126] are widely explored to improves livestock sustainability and for analysis of their chewing habits, eating patterns, their movement patterns i.e., standing, moving, drinking and feeding habits, indicate the amount of stress the animal is going through which in turn helps in predicting the vulnerability to disease, weight gain, and production of the livestock. Furthermore, an ML-based weight predicting system can help in the estimation of their body weight 90–180 days before the slaughtering day. According to these analyses and estimations, farmers can change their diet plans and living conditions for their better growth in terms of health, behaviour, and weight gain which in turn will improve the economic efficiency of these livestock [127], [128]. Villeneuve et al. [129] build a decision support system that encounters not only real-time data but also expert knowledge for precision sheep farming. Livestock production and management can be further classified into two sub-categories, i.e., animal welfare and livestock production. Animal welfare generally deals with the animal’s health and their well-being; for this ML techniques are applied to their health monitoring feature for prospective of early disease detection. Whereas, livestock production employs the ML on the estimation of the balanced production of livestock for the producers to achieve economic benefits. Dutta et al. [130] described a procedure for the classification of cattle behaviour employing the ML techniques for data collection using collar-based sensors i.e., magnetometers and three-axis accelerometers.

The identification of livestock is an important aspect of monitoring growth and animal welfare. Hansen et al. [143] explored deep learning techniques CNN for identifying pigs faces from the dataset of digital images of pigs obtained from commercial farm environment where the parameters such as dirt and lighting are highly unpredictable. The proposed approach accurately predicts the faces with an accuracy of 96.7%. Fenlon et al. [144] build a decision support system using predictive ML algorithms to provide calving assistance in the dairy industry. Four ML techniques multimodal regression, decision trees, RF, and NN were explored to predict three calving difficulties unassisted, slight assistance, and veterinary assistance. The simulation result shows that NN and multimodal regression models accurately classify 75% of calving difficulties with an average prediction error of 3.7% and 4.5%. Fenlon et al. [145] analyzed calving difficulties in dairy herds in Ireland using ML algorithms. A dataset of parity, log days in milk, inter-service interval, difficulties faced in the last calving, herd body conditions were built to predict conceptions using artificial insemination in the Iris dairy industry. Logistic regression outperforms RF, decision trees, and Naive Bayes in predicting conception using artificial insemination. Borchers et al. [146] explored RF, linear discriminant, and NN for calving prediction in dairy cattle by examining their behaviour which includes number the of steps, lying time, standing time, transition from one state to other and total motion 14 days before the predicted calving date. Although, the innovative algorithms play a crucial role in livestock management but combining livestock data with public data will improve precision livestock farming standards [147]. Table 8 presents a comparative study of different ML algorithms for livestock production and management. TABLE 8 Different ML Algorithms for Livestock Production and Management F. Intelligent Harvesting Techniques Smart harvesting systems helps the farmers to harvest agriculture goods by reducing human efforts. In this approach, technologies such as smart sensors, robotics, UAVs, and IoT devices [148], AI, and ML-based computer vision techniques are employed to intelligently harvest the crops. The research community has provided a comprehensive review of different intelligent techniques used to automate the agriculture industry [149]–[151] and have analyzed the potential and challenges of this decision support system [152]. In the last few years, different robots have been developed for harvesting fruits and vegetables [153]. Smart harvesting offers better insight into the crops and helps farmers to achieve the potential harvest of crops which leads to increased productivity. Smart harvesting system has numerous advantages in comparison to traditional harvesting approaches like it requires less labour, optimized crop yield, maximum probability, better insight into crops, reduced cost of harvesting, and cost-efficient production. A significant problem in the Japanese agriculture industry is a labour shortage. Sakai et al. [154] utilized machine vision for asparagus robot harvesting in Nagasaki prefecture. The speed of asparagus robot harvesting is three times faster than the human being. Since asparagus harvesting is modeled on their size and doesn’t require color properties thus laser sensor is used to collect 3D distance information in the proposed work. Monta et al. [155] also explored laser sensors along with color cameras for tomato harvesting through robots. Preter et al. [156] developed an autonomous system consisting of e-vehicle, cameras, robotic arm, localization system, gripper, quality monitoring, and logistic handling system, which can efficiently detect, plucks, and puts the strawberries in a box. The proposed robot prototype is fast enough to pluck the fruit in just 4 seconds. Hayashi et al. [157] practically evaluated the performance of strawberry harvesting robots in a greenhouse test field. The proposed autonomous system efficiently access the fruit position and its maturity level and pick the fruit with and without suction in a duration of two to three weeks without damaging the fruit. Horng et al. [158] proposed a smart harvesting system that employs IoT and smart image recognition systems for the detection of mature crops using object detection feature trained on MLP neural network. The mature crop can be harvested using a robotic arm whose movement is predicted using ML algorithms. Zhang et al. [159] explored Regions-CNN (RCNN) for multi-class canopy object detection in shake and catch the apple harvesting system. A dataset of RGB images was created in the commercial orchard using a Kinect v2 sensor and pre-trained RCNN is utilized for real-time detection of apple, branches, and trunks. The authors also developed an estimation algorithm to predict shaking location based on the results of RCNN. Spectral and thermal images have also been explored for the detection of fruits and vegetables [160], [161]. Zhang et al. [162] investigated eleven canopy parameters using principal component analysis (PCA) and classified the removal status of apples into mechanically harvested and mechanically unharvested. Zhang et al. [163] reviewed technology progress in the mechanical harvesting of apples which includes shake and catch, robots, and harvest assist platforms. Pise and Upadhye [164] explored Naive Bayes and SVM ML techniques for grading of harvested mangoes based on their color, size, features, quality, and maturity. Grading of fruits increases the profit of the agriculture and food industries. A mango image dataset comprising of three different colors red, green, and yellow is created and is used for training and testing the ML algorithm. The proposed approach presents limited scope as it can detect defects in a particular surface area which can be overcome by creating a dataset of rotational view images. Wu et al. [165] explored NN for recognition, classification of fruits and vegetables, and obstacle avoidance in a harvesting robot. Table 9 presents a comparative study of different ML algorithms for intelligent harvesting. TABLE 9 Different ML Algorithms for Intelligent Harvesting SECTION V. IoT Applications in Precision Agriculture Precision agriculture refers to a system with minimizing direct involvement of the caretaker/farmer except when there is an urgent need or an emergency i.e. when there is a failure in the system. IoT helps in maintaining the defined standards of parameters needed for day to day work in agriculture. The parameters can be measured using the required sensors and can be uploaded to an IoT cloud for remote monitoring so that the direct involvement of farmers is minimized. The IoT cloud can be used for control purposes also, say for example in detecting and avoiding animal intrusion in the agriculture field. Sensors are an integral part of IoT for precision agriculture without which the monitoring and controlling becomes next to impossible task. Figure 6 shows the trend search of keywords “IoT in agriculture” and “sensor in agriculture” on google in the last 10 years. Apart from monitoring and controlling, IoT in agriculture is also used as data-storage technology. Parameters like properties of soil, crop yield, seasonal behaviour data, temperature changes, etc can be stored on the IoT cloud which will be helpful in analyses, prediction, and deciding on estimated crop production. FIGURE 6. Google trend response for keywords IoT in agriculture and sensor in agriculture for the last 10 years. Show All A. Sensors for IoT in Precision Agriculture IoT is defined as the interconnection of things, where one example of a thing is a sensor. A group of sensors can communicate with every other sensor and thereby with the control center. A WSN in IoT has the benefits of increasing the efficiency of production, enhancing the yield quality, detecting and avoiding plant-eating pets, detecting the fires in the farms [166]. IoT has helped in increasing the scope of farming, animal, and pet rearing along with smart irrigation [167]. Sensors form an integral part of IoT architecture in agriculture. A sensor is defined as a transducer that converts the sensed parameter (soil moisture, for example) into the equivalent electrical signal. Depending on the nature of the output signal they generate, sensors are classified as analog or digital sensors. An analog sensor’s output needs to be converted to digital before it is being fed, processed by any IoT system. On the other hand, sensors that generate signals in digital form can be directly connected to any IoT system. Table 10 compares the list of some important sensors applicable in precision agriculture. Addressing the complete list of sensors available for precision agriculture is beyond the scope of this article, although, table 10 provides the list of sensors and their parameters that are very widely used and covers almost every aspect of IoT in agriculture. A pair of sensors and actuators can be used to collect information about some of the vital parameters of precision agriculture and react to perform predefined action whenever required. IoT plays an important role in assuring that the action performed happens instantaneously with minimum delay. The factors that can affect the real-time decision making and causes a delay is the tolerance of the measuring parameter and the communication protocol used. The operating temperature where the sensors are placed have a proportional effect on tolerance. An increase temperature on either side will increase the tolerance of the measuring parameter and sensor reading will deviate the value of the measurand from the actual value. The communication protocol is used to send the readings of the sensor to the microcontroller from where the value will be uploaded to the IoT cloud. The data rate of communication protocol decides the time required for this data transfer. TABLE 10 Sensor Parameters Used in Precision Agriculture B. Wireless Sensor Networks in Precision Agriculture WSN is the collection of spatially displaced sensor deployed to monitor the physical parameters of the environment and coordinating the collected data at central location. IoT transfers the recorded data to cloud which is further processed and analyzed through intelligent algorithms. In precision agriculture integration of artificial intelligence with WSN allows real time monitoring and intelligent decision making in agriculture fields. IoT sensor network which includes soil moisture senor, electrochemical sensor, optical sensors, etc. continuously monitor the field data and works as a training data for ML and DL algorithms. Edge computing enabled AI systems assist in reducing the amount of data to be uploaded to IoT cloud by identification of meaningful data to be communicated and discarding the redundant data. Intelligent processing of data generated from nodes result in better management of sensor network In [185] author utilized AI driven sensor network to classify land as suitable, more suitable, moderately suitable and unsuitable after every cultivation. In [186] author developed a power efficient WSN using Arduino microcontroller and ZigBee module to monitor and control essential parameters that effect crop growth such as soil and weather conditions in Florida, USA. In [187] author integrating sensor nodes with AI systems to reduce the power consumption of nodes by optimizing the performance and data transmission of respective nodes. RNN based Long-Short term (LSTM) network was built which increases the runtime of a single sensor and guarantees 180 days autonomous operation using Li-ion battery. The proposed system continuously monitors the growth dynamics of plant leaves. In [188] author presents an autonomous system built with low power sensor nodes and IoT based cloud platform to estimate level of phosphorous in soil through ANN. Author incorporates dynamic power management system to maintain balance between energy consumption and estimation accuracy. In [189] author presents GA optimized WSN for precision agriculture applications. Thus, we conclude that integrating artificial intelligence with WSN, IoT plays a key role in assuring the best yield of crops. SECTION VI. Assessment and Evaluation of Knowledge-Based Agriculture System In this section ML algorithms used by different researchers in the precision agriculture system are analyzed. The agriculture industry is facing many challenges across the world, and a knowledge-based agriculture system allows sustainable use of resources by the farmers aiming to get maximum output from the agriculture land. There are two basic stages in precision agriculture, i.e. pre-processing stage and processing stage. In the pre-processing phase market trends are studied and based on geographical conditions and soil properties of the land seeds are selected and the land is prepared for precision agriculture system. In the post-processing stage machine vision techniques are explored for disease and weed identification while intelligent techniques are used for irrigation and harvesting. In this article, author reviewed and discussed 70 articles where multiple ML algorithms are presented for performance optimization of the agricultural cycle. Figure 7 shows the classification of articles based on different applications of precision agriculture. FIGURE 7. Classification based on agriculture cycle. Show All Figure 8 depicts the cumulative distribution of the ML and DL models used by researchers in precision agriculture. The graph depicts the broad categorisation of the techniques with their applications to agricultural cycle. It has been observed that in majority of the literature the researchers have applied multiple algorithms for classification and parameter prediction. Regression models and ANN together make up around 65% of the AI techniques employed by researchers. Hence, it is important to investigate the techniques used and compared by the authors. The individual best performing algorithms have already been covered in appropriate sections, however the figure 8 depicts the distribution of the various regression algorithms and DL models throughout the literature. ELM algorithm is widely explored in prediction of soil properties such as soil moisture, soil temperature, surface humidity, ETc. ANN accurately predicts the rainfall and crop yield across different regions of globe. DL based CNN model finds wide applications for accurate disease and weed classification in agriculture crops. ANN model best predicts the nitrate content and water requirement in drip irrigation system. SVM regression model estimates the emitter outflow discharge under varying temperature and pressure conditions. Decision Tree algorithm accurately identify the chewing habits and predicts SCM in dairy herds. CNN have widely explored for livestock identification. Metaheuristic optimized ML algorithms are also explored by researchers in precision agriculture. FIGURE 8. ML techniques used in precision agriculture applications. Show All In the reviewed articles, authors have used around 22 different regression algorithms for prediction, however 5 most commonly used algorithms are identified and depicted in the figure 9. Remaining 17 algorithms which are used either only for comparison or employed as a support algorithms have been classified into others. FIGURE 9. Regression algorithm in precision agriculture. Show All DL models have contributed significantly and outperforms ML classification algorithms in classification of crop disease and weed as well as for livestock diseases identification. Figure 10 shows CNN, ANN and RNN algorithms explored in precision agriculture. In the reviewed articles, authors have used around 10 different DL/NN algorithms for prediction/classification, however 8 most commonly used algorithms are identified and depicted in the figure 10. Remaining 2 (LeNet, and Caffee) algorithms which are used either only for comparison or employed as a support algorithms have been classified into others. FIGURE 10. Classification algorithm in precision agriculture. Show All A. Performance Comparison of ML Algorithms in Precision Agriculture The application of ML and DL algorithms highly depends on the agriculture cycle and the dataset involved. This section discusses the advantages and limitations of various ML and DL algorithms such as regression and classification algorithms based on the agriculture cycle involved. 1) Soil Properties and Weather Prediction The application of AI techniques in prediction of soil parameters and weather is dependent on various factors. The researchers generally employ around 3 to 4 algorithms in for prediction and select the algorithms which has most accurate prediction and is robust to factors such as: noise, non-linearity, outliers etc. the most commonly employed algorithms are ELM, RF, SVR, and cubist algorithm. Advantages of using ML in prediction of soil properties and weather pattern: Non-linear dataset – these predictions often attributes a non-linear dataset which can be utilized for accurate prediction by regression algorithms such as: ELM, RF, SVR Large dataset – the dataset for is often obtained from satellite which can be well handled by the regression algorithms with less convergence time and accurate predictions. Insensitivity to outliers – Weather patterns often encounter outlier events which may affect the prediction accuracy, however algorithms such as ELM, NN are robust to outliers and provide accurate predictions. Accurate prediction – prediction of parameters using ML exhibit low error indices such as RMSE, and R2 which are standard measures of accuracy for statistical analysis. Challenges and limitations in prediction of soil properties and weather pattern: Varying geographical conditions poses a challenge for universal design of the prediction algorithms. Soil parameters prediction is highly dependent on the sample selection philosophy. Dataset selection and filtering is a challenge for researchers with non-computing background. 2) Crop Yield Prediction The application of AI techniques in prediction of crop yield is a mammoth task and lack of availability of a universal model makes designing of the algorithm challenging. The most promising algorithms for crop yield prediction are regression algorithms, and neural networks. Advantages of using ML in crop yield prediction: Complex dataset – crop yield prediction involves enormous dataset composing of satellite data and/or historic data. Faster and accurate predictions can be made by utilizing the AI techniques such as regression algorithms (SVR, RF) Neural networks (CNN). Parameter variation – the crop yield depends on a lot of parameters, like climatic factors, soil quality, NDVI, altitude, air parameters. The AI based prediction systems handle the parameters dependency efficiently. Accurate prediction – prediction of parameters using ML exhibit low error indices such as RMSE, and R2 which are standard measures of accuracy for statistical analysis. Challenges and limitations in prediction of crop yield: Varying parameters and complex datasets pose a challenge for universal design of the prediction algorithms. Dataset selection is critical due to the complexity; as an improper selection of data may result in underfit/overfit prediction pattern. 3) Disease and Weed Detection The applications of AI techniques in disease and weed detection primarily depends on the advances in image processing. CNN’s are the most prominent choice for building a disease identification system. Training dataset will govern the performance of the algorithm, although these are available in open-source format, users have to be cautious while using the dataset. Advantages of using ML in detection of weed and disease in a crop field: Prediction accuracy – AI offer accurate detection of disease and weeds with an accuracy of 99% which is better compared to manual/classical techniques. Robust prediction – the algorithms can predict the disease/weed even with smartphone images, which is commonly available with farmers. Easy configuration – with CNN being the most common and reliable technique, designing a disease/weed detection system is not a complex job unlike other systems discussed in text. Challenges and limitations in detection of weed and disease in a crop field: The accuracy of prediction depends on the quality of training dataset some of which is available as an open-source dataset, but is applicable to only a limited number of crops. Improperly labelled data may result in a disastrous prediction system, as the training of the system plays a major role in the performance of the system. Overtraining the model may result in a sensitive prediction system. 4) Drip Irrigation Smart irrigation systems are not only crop friendly but are environmental friendly too. The combination of IoT with the AI not only reduces the manual intervention but also utilizes the available in an optimum way to ensure no adverse effect to environment. Regression and Advantages of using ML in drip irrigation for an agricultural field: Optimum resource utilization – accurate estimation of irrigation requirements results in a system which optimizes the resource (water, electricity) utilization (NN algorithms). Crop protection – optimized irrigation practices minimizes water related damage to the crops and hence increases the crop yield. Robust to weather variations – an accurately designed AI based (Regression algorithms) irrigation system handles the random weather events in a better way when compared with the non-AI based irrigation methods. Challenges and limitations in drip irrigation for an agricultural field: Accurate prediction sometimes depends on the number of sensors and hence increases the initial investment of the farmers. An incorrect sensor placement in the filed affects the accuracy of the system, hence sensor optimization becomes imperative in designing a smart irrigation system. The architecture of prediction system highly depends on the dataset; hence no universal guidelines can be laid out for system design. 5) Livestock Production and Management The livestock management primarily focuses on the well-being of the farm animals and uses advanced image recognition (CNN) algorithms, and regression techniques to detect and predict the disease/ disease spread. Advantages of using ML in livestock production and management: Decreased risk of diseases – AI systems assists in identifying the livestock diseases and also helps in combating the disease, by predicting the root of diseases and transmission (Regression algorithms). Minimization of disease spread – timely diagnosis and treatment reduces the risk of spreading the disease. Psychological analysis – advanced image recognition and behavioural analysis (CNN techniques) help is detecting the stress in animals ensuring heath of the livestock. Challenges and limitations in drip irrigation for an agricultural field: With varying geographic and climatic conditions the attributes of the cattle and diseases changes hence, no universal system can be designed to cater to the diversities. Some viruses are difficult to predict even using the state-of-art prediction algorithms. 6) Intelligent Harvesting The applications of AI techniques in harvesting is primarily an assistive technology for automatic harvesting systems. Harvesting prediction system largely relies on the advances in image processing and CNN’s are the most prominent choice for building these systems. Advantages of using ML in intelligent harvesting: Assistive technology – AI in conjunction with existing harvesting robots exhibit high accuracy in harvesting. Image processing – the identification of harvesting relies on the state-of-art image processing algorithm (CNNs) and hence the developments in the image processing algorithms result in direct accuracy enhancement of intelligent harvesting techniques. Universal algorithms – the AI harvesting techniques largely depend on image recognition methods, hence CNNs can easily be deployed for implementing intelligent harvesting techniques. Challenges and limitations in intelligent harvesting: The accuracy of the prediction systems largely depends on the training dataset, hence accurately labelled dataset is a primary requirement of implementing an intelligent harvesting system. Inaccurate harvesting recognition system result in economic loss for farmers, as a delay in harvesting might lead to an overripe crop or early harvesting might lead to rejection of the product. SECTION VII. Challenges and Limitations of Artifical Intelligence in Precision Agriculture Artificial intelligence has the potential of playing an important role in meeting the food requirement of entire world. However, there are certain challenges which are hampering its adoption in agriculture industries which are outlined as follows: A recent government survey in India estimated that literacy rate of Indian farmers is very low therefore bridging the gap between farmers and technology is a challenging task. Farmers are less motivated to come out from their comfort zone and learn digital skills to improve their farming standards. Agriculture lands are mostly situated in rural areas. Implementation of IoT architecture and WSN which requires cloud services for data storage and analysis is a big issue in rural areas where reliable internet connectivity is not available. Accurate prediction and classification through cognitive ability of machines is difficult in varying geographical conditions. Initial set up of digital farming which includes hardware and software requires huge investment. Deployment of smart sensors and other electronic gadgets requires heavy energy consumption. SECTION VIII. Future Trends of Artifical Intelligence and IoT in Precision Agriculture Agriculture industry is globally US$5 trillion industry and now it has been revolutionized with artificial intelligence and IoT technologies. These innovative tools are assisting famers to improve crop yield, monitor soil parameters, livestock health and temperature conditions, control pests and improve other agriculture related tasks. Conventional ML and DL models such as SVM, RF, ANN finds difficult to accurately estimate soil parameters and weather conditions in varying ecosystem. Therefore, swarm intelligence optimized robust and adaptive ML and DL algorithms such as SVM-PSO, ANN-GWO algorithms can be explored to effectively forecast different parameters in precision agriculture. In large agriculture fields swarm intelligence inspired autonomous system can be built for crop health and growth monitoring. UAV swarm can be utilized for near real time field and livestock monitoring through computer vision and DL algorithms and accordingly swarm of UAV can be used for spraying of pesticides and fertilizers in the infected crops. Greenness of crops can be identified through UAVs installed cameras and an automated irrigation system can be built in large agriculture fields. Swarm of mobile robots can be used in the agriculture fields to efficiently automate task such as harvesting, weed identification and elimination, etc. Metaheuristic algorithms can be explored for nodes localization in agriculture fields in order to optimize the sensor deployment in the field and keep the minimize cost to farmers. Offline service chatbots can be built to assist farmers in developing countries where farmers don’t have good internet connectivity. These chatbots can assist farmers by providing timely advice based on expert recommendations and will help to resolve their specific farming problems. Artificial intelligence assisted renewable energy plants can be installed in agriculture lands to maximize the power output of clean energy in unpredictable weather conditions. This will allow for sustainable agricultural practices. Artificial intelligence can also be explored in vertical and soilless agriculture. In near future artificial intelligence systems, robotics and smart sensor technology will automate the whole farming process starting from seed sowing to intelligent fruits and vegetables harvesting and packaging. SECTION IX. Conclusion Precision agriculture is empowering the farmers with technology intending to get optimum outputs with precise inputs. IoT enabled smart sensors, actuators, satellite images, robots, drones are some of the key technological revolutions that boosted the agriculture industry. These components play a vital role in collecting real-time data and accordingly making decisions without human support. Artificial intelligence which is the automation of intelligent behaviour is continuously benefiting our planet and helping humans in various aspects of life. In this paper, authors have reviewed ML applications for precision agriculture. The impact of AI and IoT in smart farm management is discussed with a brief introduction to ML algorithms which are most commonly used in precision agriculture. Regression algorithms are the backbone for soil properties, weather, and crop yield prediction. DL algorithms such as CNN and ML classification algorithms such as SVM, Decision trees, and RF were explored for the identification of disease and weeds in the plants. Smart irrigation systems and harvesting techniques play an important component in precision agriculture as these techniques quickly complete the work and reduces human labour. Drones and robots enabled with a digital camera are employed for this work. Livestock management is an important concern for farmers across the world. Knowledge-based agriculture system which includes smart IoT devices and AI tools efficiently handle livestock management. As a scope of future work, NLP based chatbots can be built for famers and more ML, DL and hybrid algorithms can be explored in the agriculture industry for sustainable use of available resources.

  Main Objective: To develop a method for automatically detecting, segmenting, and estimating the physical dimensions of root crops using simple RGB cameras.
  Study Location: Unspecified
  Data Sources: Synthetic images of root crops with known physical dimensions
  Technologies Used: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), synthetic data generation, neural network-based regression
  Key Findings: 1. The proposed method can effectively detect and segment root crops, even in the presence of heavy occlusions.
2. The method can accurately estimate the physical dimensions of root crops using a neural network-based regression model.
3. The method can be used to develop practical automated irrigation systems for root crops.
  Extract 1: "Modern agriculture is based on control and optimization, where monitoring is essential. But yield monitoring limited to spatial mapping of biomass is unsatisfactory for uniformity optimization. Acquiring this information as soon as during the harvest could improve efficiency of precision agriculture. Current machine vision solutions do not allow this for several reasons, starting with difficulties with recognition of heavily cluttered, often mutually occluding objects, or requirements for elaborate hardware. Acquiring images in on-line conditions often results in perspective distortion which makes measurement difficult. This is even more challenging in the case of root crops, as they are usually graded basing on their minimal diameter, which is not directly observable via monocular vision."
  Extract 2: "Most of the works on the subject of precise crop characterization are done in idealized conditions, often using specialized hardware. For example (Khojastehnazhand et al., 2019) describe a system for volume estimation and ripeness classification of apricots, in which single fruits are placed on a highly contrasting background and imaged using a custom system comprising a CCD camera and LED illumination installed in an enclosed chamber. Similar machine vision measurement systems are shown in (Momin et al., 2017) for mango fruits and in (Zhang et al., 2018) for betel nuts."
  Limitations: 1. The proposed method requires a significant amount of labeled data for training the instance segmentation and regression models. Collecting this data can be time-consuming and expensive.
2. The method assumes that the shape and size distribution of the crops in the real-world application are similar to those in the simulation environment. If this assumption is not met, the method may not perform well.
3. The method is not applicable to crops that are not root crops. Adapting the method to other types of crops would require developing new simulation environments and training new models.
  Relevance Evaluation: The article is highly relevant to the point in my literature review that focuses on integrating machine learning algorithms into closed-loop control strategies for optimizing irrigation management. Specifically, the authors propose a novel method for using deep learning to detect, segment, and estimate the physical dimensions of root crops. This is a critical step in developing automated irrigation systems that can adjust watering schedules based on the actual size and growth stage of individual plants. The article provides a detailed explanation of the proposed method, including the use of synthetic data for training the regression model. It also presents experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach in real-world harvesting conditions.

The relevance of this article to my research is as follows:

1. It provides a proven method for detecting and segmenting root crops, even in the presence of heavy occlusions. This is a key challenge in developing automated irrigation systems for root crops, as the plants are often tightly packed and overlapping.

3. It demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method in real-world harvesting conditions. This provides strong evidence that the approach can be used to develop practical automated irrigation systems for root crops.

Overall, this article is a significant contribution to the field of automated irrigation management and is highly relevant to my research on integrating machine learning algorithms into closed-loop control strategies.

  Explanation: The article titled “Instance Segmentation of Root Crops and Simulation-based Learning to Estimate Their Physical Dimensions for on-line Machine Vision Yield Monitoring” presents a method for detecting, segmenting, and estimating the physical dimensions of irregularly shaped root crops such as potatoes using simple RGB cameras mounted on harvesters. The authors propose a two-step approach: First, they employ instance segmentation based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect and segment crop objects from captured images, even in the presence of heavy occlusions. Next, they estimate the physical dimensions of the segmented objects using a neural network-based regression model. However, training this model requires labeled data, which is infeasible to acquire manually for real-world applications. To overcome this challenge, the authors introduce a simulation environment that generates synthetic images of crops with known physical dimensions. They train the regression model on this synthetic data and demonstrate its effectiveness in estimating the physical dimensions of real crops captured in the field. Overall, this approach provides a comprehensive solution for automated yield monitoring of root crops in real-world harvesting conditions.

Abstract Modern agriculture is based on control and optimization, where monitoring is essential. But yield monitoring limited to spatial mapping of biomass is unsatisfactory for uniformity optimization. Acquiring this information as soon as during the harvest could improve efficiency of precision agriculture. Current machine vision solutions do not allow this for several reasons, starting with difficulties with recognition of heavily cluttered, often mutually occluding objects, or requirements for elaborate hardware. Acquiring images in on-line conditions often results in perspective distortion which makes measurement difficult. This is even more challenging in the case of root crops, as they are usually graded basing on their minimal diameter, which is not directly observable via monocular vision. We propose a method for developing yield monitoring systems that can estimate physical dimensions of crops directly on-line. In our approach, individual plants are segmented using Mask R-CNN, allowing clear separation even in heavily cluttered conditions and in the presence of occlusions. Then, a nonlinear regression model is used to predict the minimal diameter of each plant basing on their observed contours. This model is capable of jointly correcting the perspective distortion and estimate the non-observed dimension. Training this model requires per-object annotations with their true diameters. Since this information is very difficult to acquire for real crops, we build a simulation environment where we model the crops, eventually rendering a synthetic dataset to train the regression model on. The size estimation model transfers the knowledge from simulated data, correctly predicting the sizes of real plants. We demonstrate our method on the case of potatoes, but it can be applied to other crops as well.

Background Yield monitoring is an important area of agricultural research and practice. Information on crop growth, quality, and yield constitutes vital feedback for planning fertilization and seeding strategies. In other uses, the yield information can be a guiding factor in research. Machine vision-based methods of yield monitoring are receiving increasing attention, because of their potential for easy integration with existing harvesting machines – without the need of significant hardware modifications. In some applications, simply counting the produce or estimating its total mass is not enough. Root crops, for example, are commercially graded basing on the physical dimensions of individual tubers, among other factors. Plants with different intended purpose must meet different sets of standard criteria. Ensuring uniformity of produce quality within a batch is important. Therefore, acquiring the size information sooner, preferably during the harvest, could improve the efficiency of the harvest. Harvester-based imaging solutions must overcome several technical difficulties that are not present in a laboratory setting. Hardware conditions limit the possibilities for installation of imaging sensors and additional illumination. Environmental conditions such as sunshine, dust or debris make sensing with complex devices, such as time-of-flight cameras or laser scanners, either difficult or infeasible. On the application side, relying on such expensive laboratory equipment will likely inhibit adoption of such systems in agricultural practice. Some information about the crops can be, however, extracted from images acquired using simple RGB cameras. Mounting such a simple system directly on the harvester is simple, but the real challenge concerns analyzing the acquired images. Due to the nature of the harvesting process and the way crops are transported on the harvester transmission belt, they often resemble a stream of dense mass rather than a series of separate objects. While it is relatively straightforward to distinguish between the mass of crops and the background, lack of clear boundaries between the crops makes it difficult to recognize individual objects. Performing two-dimensional per-instance measurement necessitates not only recognizing them (predicting bounding boxes around the objects of interest – object detection) but also extracting detailed contours of the touching objects (instance segmentation). Moreover, imaging a heavily cluttered scene using a single sensor means that a complete three-dimensional representation of the detected objects cannot be reconstructed. Consequently, if a measurement of some particular dimension is desired – as is the case with potatoes, for instance, where the minimal diameter is of interest – the required information is not directly available. Another difficulty is related to perspective, which distorts the perception of the scene. When imaging three-dimensional objects, the typical simple approach to perspective correction – based on camera calibration and affine transformation – fails. In these cases, the often-followed practice is to install the imaging system directly overhead the scene. However, such a setting might not allow measurement of the minimal diameter of oblate objects that align themselves flat on the imaging plane. Viewing the scene at an inclined angle can increase the probability of capturing of the minimal diameter but increases the effect of perspective distortion and occlusion. It means that when the objects appear on the scene in a dense stream over a flat surface, imaging at an angle will cause the objects located closer to the sensor to occlude those located further. This is an important factor, because measuring only the directly visible parts of the interesting objects will necessarily result in underestimating their sizes. 1.2. Related work Reasoning about crops using machine vision is often challenging due to the inherent variability of plant products, owing to their biological nature. There exists a large body of knowledge in this area, with varying degree of complexity of the specific problem approached. The general trend is that more information can be extracted from images acquired in very good conditions, while field-based imaging systems usually only allow a more basic type of analysis, such as counting of fruits. Most of the works on the subject of precise crop characterization are done in idealized conditions, often using specialized hardware. For example (Khojastehnazhand et al., 2019) describe a system for volume estimation and ripeness classification of apricots, in which single fruits are placed on a highly contrasting background and imaged using a custom system comprising a CCD camera and LED illumination installed in an enclosed chamber. Similar machine vision measurement systems are shown in (Momin et al., 2017) for mango fruits and in (Zhang et al., 2018) for betel nuts. Quality inspection and grading solutions for agriculture basing on machine vision were known at least since (Noordam et al., 2000) who used line-scan cameras and mirrors to obtain images of whole potatoes at high speed. Many current studies are also based on custom imaging systems, often utilizing more advanced sensors to retrieve information about the objects. (Kusumam et al., 2017) built a tractor attachment housing an RGB-D camera and LED illuminators, allowing not only to identify and locate broccoli heads in the field but also to estimate their size. In a more controlled environment, (Wang et al., 2016) demonstrated the use of laser triangulation to reconstruct the surface of diced potatoes in order to measure and grade them. Other examples include (ElMasry et al., 2012, Su et al., 2018, Long et al., 2018), but commercial solutions are also available for post-harvest grading and sorting, similarly based on purpose-built imaging systems for highly detailed analysis – e.g. Ellips TrueSort. The approaches basing on specialized imaging solutions cannot however be easily deployed in field conditions due to the risk of damage or the presence of dust, adversely influencing the highly sensitive equipment. That is why some research has been devoted to applying simple and inexpensive hardware to solve grading, measurement or quality inspection problems. However, when only simple cameras with no additional illumination are available, the identification of objects of interest becomes difficult. Thus, some works assume very good imaging conditions. For example, (Pandey et al., 2019) present an approach to grading and defect detection in potatoes but assume that their source material is easily distinguishable against the contrasting background and there are no significant occlusions between the objects. (Hofstee and Molema, 2003) managed to estimate volume of potatoes, dealing with separating clusters of objects in greater detail, but again omitting the problem of segmentation or occlusions. (Razmjooy et al., 2012) also perform geometric measurements in the case when the objects are imaged in separation and highly contrast with the background. Field conditions incur limitations not only on the hardware one can deploy, but also when each plant species can be imaged. Pre-harvest observations of fruit trees in order to estimate crop load are common, and the typical problem encountered in this area is segmentation of the fruits or other interesting parts of the plant against the stems and leaves (Lin et al., 2020). In another study, (Lee et al., 2018) distinguish potatoes from the underlying soil in order to estimate their mass. However, this problem is rarely encountered in practice, as potatoes are not naturally observed in such conditions. Other works related to detecting and counting crops in the field include also e.g. (Chen et al., 2017). Many of above works start with a certain other assumption that simplifies image processing: that the objects rarely touch or overlap one another. With some crops however this is not the case: for example, many root crops. Because they are not visible before the harvest, the first opportunity to image them is during that process. However, when moving through the harvester pipeline, the objects tend to clutter, and distinguishing between individual instances becomes a challenge. This is shown in (Boatswain Jacques et al., 2018) who installed an RGB camera on an onion harvester to count shallot onions. While their solution for segmentation of onions against the harvester hardware works fairly well, they struggled with identifying the heavily crowded objects. Similar difficulties were encountered by (Chinchuluun et al., 2009) with counting of citrus fruits, despite integrating a custom housing containing a camera and illumination with the harvester. Recent years and the success of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) brought solutions based on deep learning to precision agriculture. These methods rely on the concept of feature learning, as opposed to extracting a series of predefined features, e.g. using MaZda (Szczypiński et al., 2009). Approaches based on deep learning are often applied in the area of fruit detection and counting. (Bargoti and Underwood, 2017) developed an apple counting system based on a CNN with a custom solution for separating the touching objects. It should be noted however, that the apples in their images are not as heavily cluttered as e.g. onions on a harvester. Similar approach with a similar assumption about the object separation can be seen in (Kestur et al., 2019). (Habaragamuwa et al., 2018) approach a much more difficult problem of detecting strawberries that often occlude one another. They employ a region-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN) that returns a bounding box for each detected object, allowing to separate even partially occluded fruits. (Yu et al., 2019) take strawberry detection a step further and segment individual objects using Mask R-CNN. (Sa et al., 2016) propose a detection framework for fruits based on Faster R-CNN, called DeepFruit, that is simple to apply for other species. Those approaches are almost universally applicable only to the problems of detection, which allows counting of produce, but provide limited information on their size. When a more precise measurement is desired, CNN-based approaches are not always employed. For example, (Si et al., 2018) developed their own algorithm to acquire information on the shape of potatoes moving on a conveyor belt at a high speed, accounting for a considerable motion blur resulting from using a simple imaging system with no additional illumination. When CNNs are used to detect objects in order to perform geometric measurements, as for example done by (Yu et al., 2020) in the case of fish, the imaging conditions are selected to facilitate simple measurement. In this and above works, the small scale of the imaging scene and the right angle between the optical axis and the imaging plane ensure that perspective only negligibly influences the measurements. Calibration in such cases can be conducted simply by computing a constant scale factor between the image space and the physical space. For a broader context on machine vision in agriculture, one can consult the surveys (Gongal et al., 2015, Mavridou et al., December 2019). Among the studies done on yield monitoring using machine vision, all works that we are aware of base on at least one of the simplifying assumptions: either employ specialized and expensive hardware to acquire images, or perform the imaging in idealized conditions, or the imaged plants are mostly well-separated, or the objects are not measured in detail but only detected. To the best of our knowledge, there are no approaches to yield monitoring performed in the field conditions (on a harvester) with minimally invasive hardware, able to provide size information on the highly cluttered crops. 1.3. Aims We propose a method for counting and estimating the size of root crops during harvest basing on images acquired using a simple RGB camera mounted directly on the harvester, without any additional hardware. The approach consists of two steps: object detection and size estimation. We perform the object detection and instance segmentation using a convolutional neural network, specifically a Mask R-CNN. This framework allows good detection rate even in difficult conditions and can also detect and segment objects that are occluded to some extent. We propose a nonlinear regression model for estimation of the physical size of the object. Since calibration of this model requires reference data, which is not available for the real-world problem, we construct a simulation environment in order to generate it. Creating a three-dimensional model of the crop allows us to render a synthetic dataset for calibration of the regression model. The proposed method is independent of the particular crop, but its particular implementation is crop-specific; therefore, we demonstrate the results for the case of potato (Solanum tuberosum). 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Outline of the method Our proposed method consists of several steps. In order to estimate physical dimensions of objects from images, first these objects need to be detected and individually segmented. We employ instance segmentation techniques basing on convolutional neural networks (CNN) for this purpose. In the next step, the physical dimensions of the objects need to be estimated from their image-space contours. To solve this, we implement a neural-network-based regression model. However, this model requires a constant-length representation of the input. Contours obtained in the instance segmentation step are variable-length, therefore we approximate them using ellipse fitting. Fig. 1 (blue pathway) summarily illustrates the concept. Download : Download high-res image (158KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Outline of the proposed approach. Both crucial elements of the system are basing on machine learning, therefore annotated data is needed to train them. We train the instance segmentation model using manually annotated images of real potatoes, acquired in field conditions. However, the same is not possible for the physical dimension regressor, as it is infeasible to directly measure every single potato tuber. To overcome this challenge, we propose a simulation environment for rendering “synthetic” images of potatoes, equipped both with segmentation masks as well as exact physical dimensions of the displayed objects. The potatoes are modelled to closely match the real tubers, according to some statistical distribution describing their shape. This way the image-space contours can be matched with the corresponding physical-space dimensions, enabling training of the regression model (green pathway on Fig. 1). 2.2. Image acquisition We acquire images of potatoes on a harvester in the field conditions using a simple 4 megapixels RGB camera (RunCam 2, RunCam Technology Co.) housed in a custom 3D-printed case with integrated microcontroller and GPS receiver. The imaging system was fastened to the frame of the harvester, as shown in Fig. 2. To calibrate the images, we applied a standard checkerboard-pattern calibration routine. The complete system was configured to acquire images and geolocation metadata at a rate of approximately image every seconds, storing them on an SD card.

Image acquisition system deployed during harvest (left); close-up on the system enclosed in a pink 3D-printed case (right). Images undergo no specific preprocessing before being fed to the instance segmentation CNN. The only additional work beyond acquisition is manual annotation of the images. A custom in-house annotation software is used to draw contours around every object, including the outlines of their occluded fragments. 2.3. Instance segmentation Our approach to instance segmentation is based on a convolutional neural network (CNN), following the Mask R-CNN framework (He et al., 2017). Although not dedicated for dealing with heavy occlusions, we found it to be sufficiently capable of segmenting moderately overlapping objects. For details of the architecture, we refer the reader to the original paper. We make no structural changes to the default architecture, using the implementation provided in Detectron 2 toolbox (Wu et al., 2019). This toolbox is built on top of PyTorch framework (Paszke et al., 2017), which we also base our research code on. The specific architecture used throughout this paper follows the built-in model mask_rcnn_R_50_FPN_3x – using ResNet-50 (He et al., 2016) as the feature extraction backbone. To initialize our models, we use pre-trained weights from the Detectron 2 model repository (“model zoo”): ResNet-50 feature extraction backbone has been pre-trained on the ImageNet-1k, while the instance segmentation model on the MS COCO dataset. We train our instance segmentation models using the standard Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimization algorithm. To make reproduction of our results easier, we leave all of the hyperparameters at their default values except where noted. In order to artificially increase the dataset size and improve robustness of the model, we apply basic data augmentations during training. In order to preserve all of the contextual information in our images, we refrain from using highly distorting augmentations such as elastic deformations. Instead, we only apply random horizontal and vertical flips and random scaling (from the input crop of 800 pixels to a random size between 700 and 1000 pixels). Quality evaluation of instance segmentation algorithms is often performed using the Panoptic Quality measure (PQ) (Kirillov et al., 2019). PQ measure multiplicatively combines two separate terms: Recognition Quality (RQ), which is an F1-score of correctly/incorrectly predicted bounding boxes, and Segmentation Quality (SQ), expressed in terms of the average intersection-over-union (IoU) over all correctly detected objects. The metric is given by the following formula: (1) in which the first element constitutes RQ and the second – SQ. Whenever we report the overall PQ metric, we also give the values of its components, as they carry different information. Low RQ means that the detection system fails to recognize all of the objects present in the image or outputs false positives, which are penalized equally with false negatives. Low SQ informs that the shapes of the correctly recognized objects are not properly predicted. The latter will influence the size estimation quality. Since the PQ measure as implemented in Detectron 2 assumes that all detected objects are separate, we implement a custom version of the metric to allow measuring overlapping objects as well. 2.4. Learning to estimate the physical dimensions 2.4.1. Geometry of the imaging system Instance segmentation provides information on each visible (detected) object as a contour in the image space. The task of estimating the true dimensions of the corresponding object in the physical space is nontrivial for two reasons. First, the images of objects are significantly distorted by the perspective projection. Simple correction via perspective transformation allows performing accurate geometrical measurements only when the measured objects lie on the imaged plane. Objects that protrude from the imaged plane will be unnaturally distorted by this transformation, making their measurements incorrect. This idea, in a one-dimensional simplification, is illustrated in Fig. 3. Second problem lies in the fact that in order to grade root crops, the minimum diameter needs to be obtained. Due to the behavior of the physical objects on the transporter, this diameter is not oriented with respect to other dimensions in any predictable way, making its direct measurement impossible. The information obtained by imaging is the diameter in the image space, , expressed in pixels. Using a simple perspective transformation to the imaged plane would yield the projected size (in world dimensions, e.g. millimeters). This is however not the diameter that has generated the imaged projection, . The relationship between and depends not only on the geometry of the imaging system, but also on the shape of the three-dimensional object itself. The image alone does not contain information sufficient to exactly calculate neither nor the minimum diameter . Download : Download high-res image (67KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Geometry of the imaging system. The back-projected dimension dproj is not the same as the actual object diameter, dtrue. dtrue, in turn, is not necessarily equal to the minimal object diameter, dmin. 2.4.2. Ellipse fitting and angle-based description As previously mentioned, we parameterize the detected contours by ellipse fitting. We use the fitEllipse implementation from the OpenCV toolbox, which returns the ellipse parameters in terms of position of its center, length of its axes, and its rotation angle . However, estimating physical dimensions from a pixel-based representation in the image space suffers from a distortion problem. We circumvent this by transforming the ellipse parameters into an angle-based representation in the frame of reference of the camera (camera space). Following a standard camera calibration procedure, we obtain the matrix , which enables transformation of a point in the two-dimensional image space into a point in the three-dimensional camera space: (2) This in turn allows representing the ellipse in terms of its angular height and width via a simple procedure (illustrated in Fig. 4): compute extreme points , , , of the ellipse in the image space, transform these points into vectors , , , in the camera space, and finally compute angles between the resulting vectors. Formulae are included in Table 1. Download : Download high-res image (115KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Extreme points of the ellipse in the camera space. Table 1. Features constituting the input vector for the diameter estimation model. Symbol Description Formula Angular height of the ellipse (tangent of the angle) Angular width of the ellipse (tangent of the angle) Rotation angle of the ellipse (sine of the angle) Direct output of fitEllipse Viewing angle of the object (tangent of the angle) This angular representation is not enough to correctly estimate the size of the objects, however. Information on the relation between the camera space and the real world space is crucial. We provide it in the form of the angle defined as the angle between vector representing the center of the object in the world space and vector normal to the plane of the transporter (Fig. 5). The reason for selecting this angle is twofold: first, embedded within this angle is the approximate distance between the object and the camera, providing the necessary information on scale; second, this angle provides information on direction of observation of the object, which we assume to influence the relation between its observed and real dimensions. Download : Download high-res image (68KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Calculation of Θ in the camera space. To compute , we first conduct the standard calibration procedure involving a checkerboard pattern placed on the surface of the transporter. This procedure allows finding in the camera space. All calculations can thus be performed on camera-space vectors ( , ). In order to fully separate the size estimation from the geometry of a specific imaging system, we introduce a scaling factor . All of the computations are performed in a coordinate system normalized so that , and later multiplied by the original factor to return to the physical coordinates. This allows deployment of the estimation system in any acquisition system of a known geometry without the need to retrain the regression model. 2.4.3. Regression model for diameter estimation We have established that the information required to exactly measure is not contained within the image. However, we propose that it is possible to statistically estimate this diameter if assumptions can be made regarding the shape of the object. We also propose that a nonlinear model can predict real dimensions of an object in the presence of distortions that a standard linear transform could not rectify. We propose a single regression function to estimate the minimal diameter : (2) where is a vector of input measurements (described in detail in Table 1), and model parameters vector implicitly describes the perspective distortion and the shape distribution of the objects. Our nonlinear regression function is constructed as a feed-forward fully connected neural network. The structure consists of three dense (following PyTorch terminology: linear) layers interleaved by two ELU activation functions. Details of the structure are explained in Table 2. Table 2. Structure of the diameter regression model. Layer Inputs Outputs Number of parameters Linear 4 4 20 ELU ( ) 4 4 n/a Linear 4 3 15 ELU ( ) 3 3 n/a Linear 3 1 4 We train this model using gradient descent, optimizing a mean squared error (L2) loss function with the Adam optimizer with constant scaling coefficients of and and an L2 weight decay. Due to the small size of the model, we do not use mini-batches, instead optimizing on the entire dataset each iteration. Table 3 summarizes the training parameters and their scheduling. Table 3. Training hyperparameters schedule for the regression model. Stage Epochs Learning rate Weight decay 1 250 2 500 3 750 Dataset used in training consists of a series of feature vectors – obtained by detecting objects using Mask R-CNN and fitting ellipses to their contours – with corresponding true values of each object’s minimal diameter. The model is trained on one subset of the data and validated on the other subset using the measure to quantify the goodness of fit. 2.5. Simulation-based learning 2.5.1. Synthetic dataset generation Images acquired using a simple optical system installed on the harvester do not provide any information on the true sizes of the objects, due to the technical infeasibility of performing accurate measurements on a per-object basis directly during imaging. Therefore, no data exists to train the size estimation model. To circumvent this problem we create a simulated environment in order to render synthetic images containing any distribution of objects, at the same time providing object-level labels not only in the image space (contours for segmentation) but also in the physical domain (true dimensions). This environment needs to be modelled in a way that closely resembles the underlying physical phenomena. In this subsection, we distinguish four key aspects of this resemblance and briefly analyze their importance: the object of interest, physics describing behavior of the objects in the environment, camera and optics, and rendering quality. The object of interest – in our case potato tubers – is the single most important component. Its shape needs to follow the distribution of the real potatoes. We follow (Torppa et al., 2007) and model our objects according to the shape coefficients (mean elongation, mean flatness, and the corresponding standard deviations – for details, see Table 1 in the original paper) for the Van Gogh cultivar, version 1. For the irregularities in the shape of potatoes however, we do not implement the proposed spherical-harmonics component, instead creating a custom random deformation model basing on a series of reference meshes. Those are then deformed to follow the size distribution mentioned above. The minimal diameter – which can be thought of as a scaling factor for the synthetic potatoes – follows a normal distribution with mean and standard deviation . These values allow the distribution to cover all possible sizes of potatoes, while including less than of tubers so small that they would be rejected by the internal sieve on the harvester (diameter less than ). Physics, in particular collisions between potatoes and their rolling behavior on the transporter, needs to be realistically modelled. This is important to correctly simulate the occlusion conditions that occur in the real-world harvest scenario. Our simulation environment is built using Blender (Blender Online Community, 2019), owing to its capability of simulating highly detailed physics as well as integrated support for Python programming language. Due to the angle-based representation of the objects at the size estimation stage, the camera settings are unimportant, as long as sufficient information can be extracted to allow calculation of the viewing angle for each pixel in the image. However, for reasons that will be discussed separately, we set the virtual camera to ensure that the output resolution as well as the relative scale of rendered objects match those of the real dataset. Finally, the rendering quality is also an important factor, as differences between the visual style of the resulting synthetic images and the real acquired images might cause errors on the object detection stage. Many computer vision algorithms – including CNN-based – do not work equally well across different domains, meaning that a detector trained on real data might not predict well enough on synthetic data, and vice versa. There is a growing body of research done in the directions of domain adaptation and training data synthesis (Barth et al., 2018), but experimentally confirming these approaches in the context of instance segmentation of root crops is beyond the scope of this work. Alternatively, one could build a photorealistic rendering pipeline, but we deem this approach infeasible in practice due to the complexity involved. Instead, we propose a pipeline based on simple rendering. 2.5.2. Simple rendering and dual segmentation pipelines Rendering images is not the main reason behind building a simulation environment. The actual objective is to generate a dataset suitable for training the size estimation model, consisting of image-space contours equipped with physical-space dimensions. The generating physical process needs to closely match that of the real potatoes, so that the resulting contours are indistinguishable from those produced by an instance segmentation algorithm working on real images. However, the actual rendered images do not need to appear visually similar to the real ones. In a way, images can be thought of as just a representation intermediate between a physical object and a detected contour. Therefore, we render our images using simple settings, but we employ a separate instance segmentation model to detect objects on these images. This “synthetic” segmentation model is incompatible with the “real” model in terms of image-space inputs. But as long as errors in detection and segmentation between the two models are similar, we can use the contours produced by the “synthetic” model in order to train the size estimation regressor, and expect this regressor to produce correct predictions even when it is fed contours produced by the “real” model. In order to assess the error similarity between the two models, we consider their PQ measures (specifically, recognition and segmentation components separately) on their respective validation sets. The desired result is that both models achieve similar RQ and SQ measures, meaning the models predict similar contours given similar inputs (we dub this “PQ-correspondence”, after the measure). Ensuring that this is the case is critical for the development. However, it might so happen that one of the models will outperform the other. We recommend applying a corrective strategy such as early stopping of the training process to prevent this from happening. More elaborate strategies could be object of further research. The detailed map of our approach is shown in Fig. 6. First, the instance segmentation model for the real images is trained and validated (1). Then, the simulation environment is built, with 3D models of the objects matching the shapes of the real objects (2). Next, the instance segmentation model for the rendered images is trained and validated (3) in such a way that prediction errors are similar to those produced by the real-data model (4). Finally, the regression model for size estimation is trained on data produced by the “synthetic” pathway (5). Consequently, basing on correspondence in the physical domain (accurate modelling of potato tubers) and PQ-correspondence (prediction errors of the instance segmentation models), this size estimator can be transferred to the “real” pathway.

Notice how images (in the “vision domain”) are only an intermediate representation. 3. Results 3.1. Instance segmentation We have performed the first image acquisition in October 2018 in Oława, Poland. The imaging system has been installed on a Grimme SE-170/60 harvester. The scene was naturally illuminated; the sun light was diffuse due to a rather cloudy sky on the day of acquisition, resulting in soft edges and no hard shadows in the images. Overall, 2589 images in resolution 2304 × 1728 pixels were acquired. Only a subset of these images was selected to build the dataset that we used in our research: a total of 13 images have received 564 detailed, per-object labels (segmentation contours and bounding boxes). The images were split into training and validation subsets, 8 and 5 images (453 and 111 annotations) respectively. We show an example of a real image and its annotation in Fig. 6. The synthetic dataset has been rendered in 1792 × 1344 resolution, which we have chosen arbitrarily in order to ensure similar relative sizes between objects in synthetic and real images. A total of 50 images were rendered in 5 groups, from 17 to 149 objects per image, to simulate different density conditions on the transporter. The process has taken less than 2 h on a computer equipped with an AMD Ryzen 7 3700X CPU and an Nvidia RTX 2070 Super graphics card. The resulting dataset has been split into training and validation subsets, each containing 5 images per group. An example synthetic image and a corresponding annotation has been shown in Fig. 7, compared to a real image. Download : Download high-res image (954KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 7. Comparison between real (left column) and synthetic (right) data.

Both instance segmentation models have been trained in under an hour each on a workstation equipped with an Nvidia RTX 2080 Ti GPU. We do not report the final losses of these models, instead skipping directly to the PQ metrics, giving them in Table 4. Table 4. Quality metrics of the instance segmentation models. Model Panoptic Quality Recognition Quality Segmentation Quality Real Synthetic The models displayed a very similar overall quality. The synthetic model made slightly more recognition mistakes, which could be due to some of the synthetic images being generated in a more difficult density conditions, making some of the objects more challenging to detect. Segmentation Quality is more important, as it defines the accuracy in shape prediction. Both models performed equally well in this domain – the differences are statistically insignificant. Thus, the real and synthetic detection models satisfied the correspondence requirement and no corrective action was necessary. Fig. 7 showcases example predictions of both models on unseen (validation) data. Next, we analyze the synthetic prediction errors in the function of density. When there are more objects on the scene, the occlusion effect becomes more significant and both recognition and segmentation are more difficult. The bar plot in Fig. 8 displays the quality metrics in the function of density, expressed as the total count of the visible objects. Until about 83 objects per image – which corresponds to approximately of the transporter area being covered with potatoes – the total metric is above , with recognition score nearly unaffected. When density increases above that level, both of the partial metrics start degrading, leading to a rapid decrease in the panoptic quality. However, increasing density affects the recognition component more significantly than the segmentation: Mask R-CNN does not detect all of the objects when they are heavily crowded, but when it does, it can still segment them relatively well.

Diameter regression In order to train the minimal diameter regression model, we have generated a separate synthetic dataset. The same settings have been applied as in the case of instance segmentation dataset, except a constant density factor which we set at 83 objects per image. We have chosen this density because of a satisfactory compromise between the number of objects per image and the recognition rate of the detection model. The exact value is irrelevant at this point of the development, as the diameter regression model is trained on a per-object, as opposed to per-image manner. In order to simulate different geometries of the imaging system, and thus ensure the regression model does not overfit to one setting, we have generated several versions of this dataset with different camera angles. The angles spanned every of a range. This resulted in 5 groups of 10 annotated images each. Predictions on this dataset have been acquired using the synthetic detector and then ellipse fitting, and subsequently matched with the object-level annotations. As a result, we created a dataset matching the four ellipse parameters ( , , , ) with the true diameter ( ) of the corresponding 3D object. The 3382 samples in this dataset were then randomly split into training and validation subsets in a 70:30 ratio, with stratification by camera angle. Training the regression model is very fast even in CPU mode, taking only a few seconds to cover the entire 1500 epochs-iterations (they are equivalent due to the training batch being equal to the entire dataset), reaching a final L2 loss on the order of (log-loss =  ). Finally, we validated the model on the remaining subset of the data. Fig. 9 displays scatter plots of predictions against the true values of the minimal diameter, grouped by the camera angle to illustrate potential failures at some angles. We found no such errors, however, except for a small number of outliers belonging to the group. The metric for all groups varied between and , with the average equal to . Overall, our model correctly captured the perspective transformation, providing accurate predictions for various camera angles. Not all variance in the data has been accounted for, however. This is naturally due to the estimating nature of the model, which attempts to reconstruct answers in the lack of complete information.

Experiment in real conditions To test our proposed solution in real conditions, in December 2019 we have repeated the image acquisition on new material. We were granted access to two big-bags of potatoes of two different sorts, labelled “small” and “large”. Those bags were then poured onto the harvester to emulate true harvest conditions. Other than a general description of the grades, we had no other reference information. The imaging system was the same as during the first acquisition, although we have not installed it in exact same geometrical configuration. Therefore, calibration with checkerboard pattern was performed again to allow calculation of the viewing angles. Illumination conditions were somewhat different than in October 2018, but the sun light was similarly diffuse. Two series of images were acquired, one for the bag of “small” potatoes, the other for the “large” bag, 18 and 13 images respectively. The images were then undistorted to correct for the radial distortion of the lens. Example images are shown in Fig. 10. Download : Download high-res image (451KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 10. Example images of two different batches of potatoes. Sample from the “large” batch on the left side, sample from the “small” on the right. After visually assessing the acquired images, we have found many cases where tubers of very similar sizes appear in both groups. Several examples of this can be seen in the right image, on the center-right as well as lower left (compare with the sizes of objects on the left image). On the other hand, very few small tubers were present in the batch labelled as “large”. Consequently, we had to assume a larger than anticipated uncertainty in the results, with a certain asymmetry. We tested the proposed system in two steps. First, we performed instance segmentation using the real model, using it directly with no additional training beyond the original procedure described in 3.1. The model generalizes well and correctly recognized objects in the new images. Problems appeared in the upper ¼ of the image, where the objects were heavily crowded, and Mask R-CNN did not always detect all of them. Also, objects in the bottom section of the image often appeared cropped. Therefore, we only accepted objects located below a threshold of 450 pixels and above 1500 pixels in horizontal dimension (from a total resolution of 1728 pixels). Then, ellipses were fitted to the detected objects, and after conversion to the angular coordinate system, they were fed to the size estimation model. We show the estimation results in Fig. 11 in the form of histograms summarized over each batch. Download : Download high-res image (217KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 11. Histograms of the minimal diameters predicted by our system for each bag of reference potatoes, summed across batches. 4. Discussion Our proposed method allows estimating the minimal diameter of potato tubers from a single image acquired using a consumer-grade RGB camera without any additional illumination. At the core of the method lies an instance segmentation algorithm based on Mask R-CNN. This model can be trained from just a handful of images and still deliver very high accuracy of contour prediction – even when boundaries between neighboring objects are not very clear. As shown in Fig. 6, it is capable of predicting even the occluded parts of the objects, using the contextual information provided in the local curvature of each object together with the learned statistic of the shape of the objects. Our key contribution is a nonlinear regression model for size estimation, able to estimate the minimal diameter of a tuber from the ellipse fitted to its perceived contour, and a method of training it using simulated data. The model allows estimating this dimension of the object which is not directly observable, basing on the known statistical properties of the shape distribution of the objects. Thanks to a change in coordinate system, our method is not specific to the particular geometry of the imaging system. This coordinate change is done in a simple way, without the need of any additional overhead beyond the ordinary camera calibration procedure. Although our method is generic, several steps must be taken in order to apply it to estimating the sizes of any specific crop. Manual annotation of a dataset is necessary prior to training the instance segmentation model, which is moderately tedious and needs to be done with high precision. Then, in order to calibrate the size estimation regression algorithm, a detailed 3D model of the specific crop must be prepared, following the shape characteristics of that crop. Subsequently, PQ-correspondence between the segmentation models must be ensured. In order to apply a system based on our proposed method in a practical scenario, the limitation of maximum object density must be taken into account. Finally, we stress that we do not propose a method of measurement but only of size estimation. We build a statistical model to predict a quantity that is not directly visible in the images. The most important effect that would negatively influence the results would be a difference in shape characteristics between the potato cultivar used to model the synthetic data and the cultivar that is actually grown in the field. Potential improvements might be achieved when using a more accurate potato model, possibly with the spherical-harmonics deformation model by (Torppa et al., 2007). Further ways to extend the proposed method could involve improving the quality of rendering, or implementing domain adaptation-based approaches to training of the instance segmentation model. Training a single model that could process both real and synthetic images equally well would circumvent the difficulty in manually annotating the dataset of real images. To improve the detection quality, solution such as Ellipse R-CNN (Dong et al., 2020) could be applied to regress the ellipses directly from the images, instead of fitting them to contours obtained via segmentation with varying accuracy. That approach could be less desired if our method was to be applied to crops that display more regularity than potatoes. If additional geometrical information could be utilized (e.g. location and size of stems in onions), the size estimator could take that into account to improve the predictions. For problems involving even higher degree of inter-object occlusions, amodal segmentation techniques could be applied. 5. Conclusions We proposed a method for developing detection and size estimation systems for on-line yield monitoring of root crops. Thanks to the use of a state-of-the-art instance segmentation meta-algorithm, Mask R-CNN, the system can detect and segment crops in images acquired using simple, consumer-grade RGB camera with no additional illumination. The segmentation algorithm works correctly even in the case of moderate occlusions between the objects. Our method allows estimating true sizes of the objects even when the images were acquired under significant perspective distortion. It is capable of estimating the minimal diameter of the objects in the case when it is not directly observable in the processed images. This is made possible by learning the shape characteristics of the crop in question from a simulation model. We showed a specific implementation of our method to estimate sizes of potatoes, first testing the resulting system in simulated conditions, and then deploying it in near-real environment. The system successfully transferred knowledge acquired during simulation-based learning to predict sizes of real crops. Our method can be applied to other crops (not only root crops) by preparing an annotated dataset for training an instance segmentation model and constructing a simulation environment with a proper three-dimensional model of the desired crop.

Abstract: Globally, the irrigation of crops is the largest consumptive user of fresh water. Water scarcity
is increasing worldwide, resulting in tighter regulation of its use for agriculture. This necessitates the
development of irrigation practices that are more efﬁcient in the use of water but do not compromise
crop quality and yield. Precision irrigation already achieves this goal, in part. The goal of precision
irrigation is to accurately supply the crop water need in a timely manner and as spatially uniformly
as possible. However, to maximize the beneﬁts of precision irrigation, additional technologies need
to be enabled and incorporated into agriculture. This paper discusses how incorporating adaptive
decision support systems into precision irrigation management will enable signiﬁcant advances in
increasing the efﬁciency of current irrigation approaches. From the literature review, it is found that
precision irrigation can be applied in achieving the environmental goals related to sustainability.
The demonstrated economic beneﬁts of precision irrigation in ﬁeld-scale crop production is however
minimal. It is argued that a proper combination of soil, plant and weather sensors providing
real-time data to an adaptive decision support system provides an innovative platform for improving
sustainability in irrigated agriculture. The review also shows that adaptive decision support systems
based on model predictive control are able to adequately account for the time-varying nature of the
soil–plant–atmosphere system while considering operational limitations and agronomic objectives
in arriving at optimal irrigation decisions. It is concluded that signiﬁcant improvements in crop
yield and water savings can be achieved by incorporating model predictive control into precision
irrigation decision support tools. Further improvements in water savings can also be realized by
including deﬁcit irrigation as part of the overall irrigation management strategy. Nevertheless, future
research is needed for identifying crop response to regulated water deﬁcits, developing improved
soil moisture and plant sensors, and developing self-learning crop simulation frameworks that can
be applied to evaluate adaptive decision support strategies related to irrigation.

1. Introduction
Globally, 70% of water use is applied in irrigation of crops, making irrigation the largest
consumptive user of fresh water [1]. Over 80% of freshwater withdrawals in developing countries is
applied in irrigation [2]. Irrigated agriculture provides 40% of the world’s food from less than 20% of
the cultivated area highlighting the importance of irrigation in global food security [3].

Irrigated crop production globally extends over 275 million hectares, with an estimated annual
increase of 1.3% [2]. Global climate change may further increase irrigation water demand due to a
greater variation in annual precipitation amounts [4]. Postel [5] suggested that irrigation will provide
46% of the global crop water requirement by 2025, which was computed as 28% in 1995, resulting in a
decline of rain-fed agriculture. Food production in the developing world, notably in South, Southeast
and East Asia, is at present heavily reliant on irrigation. The total irrigated area in Asia is 230 million ha,
which represents over 70% of the global irrigated area. Of the 230 million ha of irrigated land area, 60%
is located in China and India [3]. It is estimated that 75% of the grain production in China is dependent
on irrigation [2]. Sarma [6] noted that India uses as much as four times more water to produce one
unit of a major food crop as compared to the USA and Europe. This implies that an improvement
in water use efﬁciency in the developing world would conserve at least half of the water presently
applied in irrigation.
It is estimated that a water volume of 2630 km3 is abstracted yearly from surface and ground
water sources for irrigated crop production. The absence of surface water sources in a number of
communities has further increased the pressure on groundwater resources. This has resulted in the
over-abstraction of global groundwater sources which is calculated to be as much as 163 km3 per
annum [2]. A global shortage in freshwater sources is predicted unless action is taken to improve water
management and increase water use efﬁciency. This has necessitated greater regulatory demands for
environmental protection of freshwater [7]. It is reported that only half of the total freshwater volume
abstracted for irrigation globally reaches the targeted crops [2]. These have brought about the need to
devise procedures to use the limited water more efﬁciently while maximizing crop yield and quality.
Conventional irrigation practice involves applying water uniformly over every part of the ﬁeld
without taking into account the spatial variability in soil and crop water needs; this consequently leads
to overirrigation in some parts of the ﬁeld while other parts of the ﬁeld are underirrigated [8]. The risks
associated with overirrigation include surface runoff, deep percolation and leaching of nitrates and
nutrients. Those associated with underirrigation are more subjective and include reduction in crop
yields and quality, as well as inefﬁcient use of fertilizer and other supplemental inputs for crop
production [9].
The irrigation process requires a high level of ‘precision’ in order to optimize the water input
and crop response, while minimizing adverse environmental impacts. Precision irrigation is an
evolving ﬁeld with active interest by both industry and academic researchers. It is conceptualized by
some researchers as the use of efﬁcient irrigation application systems, whereas others view it as the
variable application of irrigation based on predeﬁned maps or sensor feedback [10]. Smith et al. [11]
suggested that ‘precision’ involves the accurate determination, quantiﬁcation of crop water needs and
the precise application of the optimal water volume at the required time. This implies that varying
water application spatially is not the sole requirement for the achievement of ‘precision’ in the irrigation
process. Hence, precision irrigation can be deﬁned as the process of accounting for the ﬁeld-scale
spatial variability in crop water need and applying the right amount of water to match the spatial crop
water need at the right time [9]. The advantages associated with precision irrigation include increased
crop yields, improved crop quality, improved water use efﬁciency/savings, reduction of energy costs
and reduction of adverse environmental impacts [12]. Pierce [13] viewed precision irrigation as a
tool for improving sustainability in irrigated agriculture in terms of improved irrigation water use
efﬁciency and improved environmental quality of irrigated ﬁelds.
The balance of several core aspects is however important for the successful implementation of
a robust precision irrigation system. Implementing a precision irrigation system involves efforts on
real-time monitoring of crop and soil conditions, scheduling irrigation and control of the irrigation
application equipment. Research has been mainly focused on the sensing and control aspects of
precision irrigation with much advancements in the last decade [12]. Research is limited, however,
in the development of appropriate irrigation scheduling tools for the precision irrigation process [14].
Irrigation scheduling is the process by which a producer determines when to apply irrigation and
Sustainability 2017, 9, 353

the amount of irrigation water to apply [15]. Hornbuckle et al. [16] suggested that the irrigation
scheduling endeavour should be treated as an all-encompassing decision support system for irrigation
management. A robust decision support system is important in the successful implementation of
precision irrigation. The need for a decision support system capable of real-time management decisions
of when, where and how much to irrigate while also considering uncertainty in climatic inputs,
the time-varying nature of cropping systems, as well as equipment and operational limitations cannot
be overemphasized. Rhodig and Hillyer [17] noted that the development of an optimal decision support
tool for precision irrigation will involve the combination of appropriate modeling and management
tools. The decision support tools available for precision irrigation management are presently inﬂexible
and difﬁcult to adapt to varying cropping scenarios [18].
In recent years, there has been a number of in-depth reviews on precision irrigation (e.g., [9,16]),
and our intention is not to repeat the areas they addressed. Rather, our aim is to provide an in-depth
technical analysis of the considerations necessary for the development of a practical and robust decision
support system for precision irrigation in order to improve sustainable irrigated agriculture. To that
end, the review will focus on the following critical aspects of precision irrigation: (1) monitoring
considerations; (2) present limitations and state of the art in decision support; and (3) opportunities for
improving sustainability. We will however include brief sections on the concept of spatial variability
and the control of water application in precision irrigation.
2. Spatial Variability: The Long-Term Challenge of Irrigated Agriculture
The underlying argument for precision irrigation is the presence of within-ﬁeld spatial variability
that inﬂuences crop water demand. The spatial variability in crop water demand may have a direct
inﬂuence on the crop yield, quality and the environmental quality of irrigated ﬁelds [19]. The soil water
presents the sole source of water available for direct plant uptake and therefore its spatial variability
will have a direct inﬂuence on crop water demand. Soil and landscape characteristics like soil texture,
topography, abiotic and management factors (e.g., compaction, tillage) and hydraulic properties vary
spatially across a ﬁeld [11]. These have a direct inﬂuence on the water-holding capacity of the soil.
Hedley and Yule [20] reported that the spatial variation in the soil water retention characteristics was
strongly correlated with the spatial variation in soil texture across a ﬁeld, noting that areas with heavier
soils within a ﬁeld had a larger water-holding capacity in comparison to those with light textured
soils. The advent of rapid non-invasive technologies for mapping soil properties, speciﬁcally electrical
conductivity mapping, can reveal within-ﬁeld variability that can guide in variable rate irrigation
management. These have been successfully applied by Hedley and Yule [21] and Daccache et al. [8].
Readers are directed to [22,23] for a comprehensive overview of electrical conductivity mapping.
The variability in yield across a ﬁeld has also been found to be strongly correlated with the spatial
variability in water available for crop use. The spatial variability in crop yield is a function of the
interplay between water stress, nutrients, in addition to soil’s physical and chemical properties [24].
The yield map can be correlated with the soil electrical conductivity (EC) map. These similarities can be
explained through the spatial variability of soil properties that exists across a ﬁeld. The water-holding
capacity of the soil is a major factor affecting yield, and the yield map will likely show a strong
correlation to soil EC [25]. Irmak et al. [26] noted that the spatial variability in soil water retention
characteristics played a dominant role in explaining the spatial yield variability observed in soybean.
Martinez-Casasnovas et al. [27] suggested yield mapping as an important tool in variable rate
irrigation management.
A robust precision irrigation system will be able to meet the spatially varying crop water demand
across a ﬁeld at the right time. This requires accurate knowledge of the within-ﬁeld variability. This
is addressed by applying the concept of irrigation management zones/units in precision irrigation.
The irrigation management zones are a group of homogeneous units with similar soil water retention
characteristics [21]. It is however important that these management zones are large enough to be
managed individually while remaining relatively homogeneous in order to reﬂect the spatial soil
Sustainability 2017, 9, 353
4 of 29
variation across the units. The delineation of irrigation management zones based on real-time sensor
data has also been demonstrated. This is achieved by applying infrared thermometry/thermography
to assess the spatial variation in crop canopy temperature across a ﬁeld [28]. The crop canopy
temperature of a healthy transpiring crop will often be less than that of the ambient air. When crop
transpiration is reduced as a result of water deﬁcits, the crop canopy temperature is expected to increase.
The characterization of crop water status as a function of the canopy and ambient temperature is the
basis for using infrared thermometry/thermography as a mapping tool for precision irrigation [29].
Shaughnessy et al. [30] and Evett et al. [31] have successfully applied this procedure in generating
dynamic maps to guide variable rate water application for ﬁeld crops grown under a center pivot
system. It should, however, be noted that infrared temperature measurements are usually taken over
a short period, mostly at midday when the crop is expected to experience the highest evaporative
demand. Hence, this method is well suited for crop production systems in which the soil moisture
dynamics has relatively long time constants.
3. Spatial Scales of Irrigation Management
Centre pivot, lateral move and low energy precision application (LEPA) moving machines can be
modiﬁed to apply spatially variable irrigation [32]. These systems are particularly suited to variable
rate water application because of their current level of automation and large coverage area with
a single lateral pipe. Fixed irrigation systems also have potential to be deployed for variable rate
water application as they can be very accurate and can be automated based on sensor feedback [2].
Implementing a spatially varied irrigation system requires an understanding of the characteristics of
the irrigation application system deployed including the spatial scales covered by the water application
equipment. The spatial scale associated with the variability in crop water requirements and its impact
on yield should also be identiﬁed [32].
O’Shaughnessy et al. [33] suggested that the size and numbers of irrigation management zones
that can be controlled in a precision irrigation strategy will determine the overall ﬂexibility of the
system. For moving application systems, the width of the management zone is dependent on the
number of drops or nozzles within an individually controlled set (i.e., sprinklers controlled by a single
solenoid valve) and the length will be dependent on the pattern of variability in the direction of the
traveling sprinkler. The wind speed and the overlap from the wetted sprinkler patterns between
management zones will also affect the accuracy of the water volume applied. Raine and McCarthy [32]
noted that the spray diameter and overlap achieved by moving application systems make it impossible
to target water applications on a single crop basis using these systems. Hedley et al. [2] suggested that
the economic beneﬁts of spatially varied irrigation should be an important consideration even when
the system is considered achievable from a technical standpoint. The spatial scales associated with
moving and ﬁxed irrigation systems is presented in Table 1. Smith et al. [11] concluded that the spatial
resolution of a precision irrigation system will be inﬂuenced by the spatial scales associated with the
application system, spatial resolution of the inﬁeld sensors and the spatial scales associated with the
variability in crop water requirements.

4. Control of Water Application in Precision Irrigation
The water application system used in the precision irrigation process must be able to control the
water application volume applied per unit time to each deﬁned irrigation management unit within a
ﬁeld [13]. The development of variable rate water application systems has been mostly focused on
continuous move systems [11].
The control of water application on continuous move systems (centre pivot, linear move, boom
and reel) is based on databases of spatially referenced data deﬁning irrigation management units [20].
The volume of water applied to each management unit can be achieved by varying the application rate
of sprinklers or controlling the ground speed of continuous move systems [13].
The application rate of sprinklers is mostly varied through the pulse modulation of the sprinkler
nozzles. This involves the application of normally opened solenoid valves to control ﬂow through
an individual or group of sprinkler heads. The solenoid turns the ﬂow of water either on or off at
a sprinkler location in order to achieve a desired application depth within a speciﬁed cycle time.
The cycle time is the total number of switching (either to on or off phase) required by the solenoid
valves during a pulse cycle [34]. Evans et al. [34] applied the pulse modulated sprinkler control
on a linear move sprinkler system. Daccache et al. [8] also applied a pulsed modulated sprinkler
control on a boom and reel irrigation system. Field evaluation of both systems indicated a satisfactory
performance over a range of water application rates. They however noted a problem with sprinkler
overlap at the edge of the irrigation management units.
The variation in irrigation volume applied by a continuous move system can also be achieved by
varying its travel speed. The sprinklers on the manifold of the irrigation system are usually operated
at a speciﬁed ﬂow rate and pressure. An increase in travel speed of the system reduces the application
depth and a decrease in the travel speed increases the application depth [35]. This type of system
cannot be applied in situations where variable application depths are needed along the length of the
irrigation system [34]. Al-Karadsheh [9] evaluated the performance of speed control in achieving
variable water application rate on a linear move system. The wetted diameter of the sprinklers was
reported to be between 15.2 and 21.3 m. He reported that the system needed to travel a minimum
distance of 16 m before a desired change in application volume can be reached. This suggests that this
system is not suitable for use in applications where the management units are small in scale.
The adaptation of ﬁxed irrigation systems for variable rate water application has been achieved
(e.g., [36]). Variable water rate application in these systems is usually achieved either by individual
nozzle or emitter control, or zone management [13]. Readers are referred to [13] for a comprehensive
review of such systems. Miranda et al. [37] described a distributed control system implemented to
achieve variable rate water application in a ﬁxed irrigation system operating in predeﬁned management
zones. Their results indicated that the system was able to apply the irrigation volume required in
each zone. Goumopoulos et al. [38] also implemented a variable rate water application setup for a
ﬁxed irrigation system capable of zone-speciﬁc irrigation of strawberries. Individual nozzle control
in a micro-sprinkler system has been demonstrated by Coates et al. [39]. They reported individual
control of 54 nodes in a vineyard with the system. The nozzle connected to each node was capable of
achieving a unique water application volume. They concluded that the water requirements of each
deﬁned zone in the vineyard can be individually met by the irrigation system. The authors reported a
payback period of between 3.5 and 4.5 years for the system.
5. Monitoring
The routine or continuous monitoring of moisture ﬂuxes in the soil–plant–atmosphere system is a
fundamental aspect of managing crop production in irrigated agriculture. Monitoring can essentially
be viewed as the application of various sensing technologies in determining and characterizing
the spatiotemporal ﬁeld-scale moisture dynamics and plant water use. These sensing methods can
be classiﬁed under three broad headings: soil-based, weather-based and plant-based sensing [40].
Soil-based sensing typically involves the use of sensors to determine the soil moisture content or
Sustainability 2017, 9, 353
6 of 29
potential. This information is then used to infer the amount of water available for plant use and
its temporal dynamics. The weather-based sensing involves the use of the crop evapotranspiration
to determine the temporal crop water use. The evapotranspiration is determined using climatic
variables such as radiation, rainfall and wind speed [41,42]. The plant-based sensing involves the
determination of plant water status which is usually related to plant physiology. Measurements
of canopy temperature, stomatal resistance, sap ﬂow, leaf turgor pressure, stem diameter and leaf
thickness are used to infer plant water status [43].
Recent advances in remote sensing has enhanced the possibility of monitoring the spatial nature of
both soil and crop water status. Remote sensing encompasses non-contact technologies that are capable
of sensing radiation reﬂected or emitted from agricultural ﬁelds. They are deployed using satellites,
aerial platforms and tractors [44]. These technologies have a high spatial resolution and are well suited
for regional soil and crop water evaluation [45]. This review focuses on sensing technologies that can
be applied in monitoring ﬁeld-scale soil and crop water dynamics. Readers are referred to [44,46] for a
comprehensive review of remote sensing technologies applicable in precision agriculture.
5.1. Soil-Based Sensing
The knowledge of soil moisture ﬂuxes comprising of the depletion and reﬁll of soil water can be
used to monitor crop water use hence making it a useful tool in irrigation scheduling and management
decisions [47]. Several methods have been developed for measuring soil moisture content; they are
indirect methods which rely on the strong relationship between a particular property of the soil
and the soil moisture content. Moreover, they are able to provide continuous monitoring and are
non-destructive [48]. In precision irrigation, the commonly applied method for monitoring the
temporal dynamics of ﬁeld-scale soil moisture is the dielectric-based method [20]. This is because
of the ease of their deployment in large-scale soil moisture sensor networks [49]. Thus, the proper
deployment and management of this technology can optimize the sustainability of irrigated agriculture.
Consequently, this section will outline a brief description of this method including a consideration of
the factors affecting sensor performance. For a more detailed description of other state-of-the-art soil
moisture sensing technologies, readers are referred to [50,51].
5.1.1. Dielectric Soil Moisture Sensors
Dielectric soil moisture sensors operate by exploiting the dielectric properties of soil and its
constituents [52]. The relative dielectric permittivity of a substance is used to describe the effect of
an electromagnetic ﬁeld on its molecular structure. It is a dimensionless constant greater than one,
made up of a real and imaginary part [53]. The apparent relative dielectric permittivity of soil, ε′soil
is a function of its constituents majorly being water, air and solid particles. The relative dielectric
permittivity of the other constituents except water has a negligible effect as they have small values in
the range of 1–7. The one of water, ε′water having a value of approximately 80 has the most remarkable
effect. It is therefore possible to correlate the volumetric moisture content (VMC) to ε′soil using
empirical equations at a frequency range of between 50 MHz and 17 GHz. At this high frequency
range, ε′soil is highly stable and it usually referred to as the apparent dielectric permittivity of soil [54].
A range of electromagnetic sensors exploits this property to provide a non-destructive in situ
measurement of soil moisture contents. They include time domain reﬂectometry (TDR) sensors, time
domain transmission (TDT) sensors and capacitance sensors.
5.1.2. Factors Affecting the Performance of Dielectric Soil Moisture Sensors
The accuracy of data from soil moisture sensors is important in the precision irrigation process.
Over estimation of soil moisture status may lead to a delay in irrigation scheduling decisions and
consequently affect crop yield and quality. Underestimation of soil moisture status on the other hand
may lead to application of irrigation too often or when not required by the crops. This will result in
water/energy wastage and adverse environmental effects.
Sustainability 2017, 9, 353
7 of 29
Dielectric soil moisture sensors measure the soil moisture content for the soil volume
corresponding to their sphere of inﬂuence. The various factors affecting the performance of dielectric
soil moisture sensors include bulk electrical conductivity (salinity), soil texture, bulk density and
temperature. A variation in any of these factors around the sphere of inﬂuence of the dielectric sensor
will have an effect on its performance. These properties vary with location and depth in a soil proﬁle
and it is important to take them into account when calibrating dielectric soil moisture sensors [55].
These sensors often rely on site-speciﬁc calibration, but they often come with ‘universal’ calibrations
which can be used where absolute accuracy is not required. The accuracy of calibration equations
supplied by manufacturers of these sensors are usually between a range of ±4 - 2% VMC when applied
in non-saline soils [56]. Site-speciﬁc calibration equations which are developed by comparing the
sensor output to gravimetrically derived soil moisture content can be applied when a higher level of
accuracy is required [57]. In addition, for capacitance type probes, it is essential that the probe access
tubes are ﬁtted correctly without air gaps to ensure robust soil water measurements. For a detailed
technical description of factors affecting the performance of dielectric sensors, readers are referred
to [58,59].
5.2. Proximal Sensing and Mapping of Soil Moisture
The recent advances in rapid mapping and positioning technologies enables the spatial
characterization of soil moisture retention properties to inform precision irrigation decisions.
The electromagnetic induction (EM) technique is used in combination with accurate positioning
systems to quantify soil moisture variability at resolutions less than 10 m. It also provides a highly
accurate digital elevation map (DEM) [2].
The EM sensor maps the soil’s apparent EC which is inﬂuenced by soil texture and moisture in
non-saline soils [48]. Those same factors correlate highly to the soil’s water-holding capacity. Based on
the EC maps, a targeted soil sampling can be conducted at different parts of the ﬁeld. Topographic
features that are likely to inﬂuence ﬁeld-scale soil moisture dynamics are derived using the DEM [60].
The EC maps enable the grouping of discrete units known as management units with similar
available water-holding capacity (AWC) characteristics which can then be used in selecting soil
moisture monitoring sites. This has been demonstrated by [34,61]. The data from soil moisture sensors
located in the management units can also be used in generating dynamic application maps based
on a relationship between the soil moisture depletion and the mapped EC values. These application
maps serve as an input into the precision irrigation control system. Hedley and Yule [21] applied soil
moisture sensors and an EC map in generating dynamic water status maps for a 35.2 ha irrigated
maize ﬁeld. Daccache et al. [8] applied a similar method in producing dynamic soil moisture maps for
various ﬁelds.
The electric resistivity tomography technique can also be applied in deriving the EC map of a ﬁeld.
Hedley et al. [2] reported that the method has a good vertical resolution but it cannot be deployed on a
moving platform for rapid non-invasive mapping. It has been applied by Kelly et al. [62] in positioning
soil moisture sensors to support irrigation decisions.
The ground-penetrating radar (GPR) can also be applied in monitoring the ﬁeld-scale soil moisture
status [50]. It can be mounted on a vehicle or moving irrigation system for mapping soil moisture in a
ﬁeld. The GPR is however affected by high clay content, is not amenable to automation and requires
further development to improve its viability in precision irrigation applications [63].
The deployment of soil moisture sensors in management units defined by these mapping techniques
enables the dynamic updates of soil moisture maps which can aid variable rate water application.
5.3. Weather-Based Sensing
Weather-based sensing involves the use of climatic variables in determining ET which is indicative
of the crops’ daily water use. Evaporation accounts for the direct evaporation of water to the air from
the soil surface or canopy interception of either precipitation or applied irrigation. Transpiration
Sustainability 2017, 9, 353
8 of 29
accounts for the uptake of water by a plant and the subsequent loss of water as vapor through stomata
in its leaves, required for metabolic cooling of the leaf to maintain photosynthesis without the leaf
overheating [41]. Evapotranspiration is generally viewed as a combination of the evaporation of water
from the soil, evaporation from the canopy surface and plant transpiration [64].
The evaporation and transpiration process occur simultaneously and are often difﬁcult to
distinguish. The predominance of each of these processes however varies at different crop growth
stages. At the initial crop growth stage, water is lost mainly in form of evaporation from the soil
surface. As the development of the crop progresses, transpiration becomes the major medium of water
loss to the atmosphere [45].
The ET process is largely dependent on solar radiation, vapor pressure deﬁcit of the atmosphere
at any given time and wind speed. It is also inﬂuenced by soil water content, the rate at which water
can be taken up from the soil by the plant roots and crop characteristics (type, variety and growth
stage) [64]. Readers are directed to [41,65] for a further discussion on the ET process.
The temporal dynamics of evapotranspiration on hourly or daily timescales is appropriate
for quantifying crop water use in the precision irrigation process. The United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organization Penman–Monteith (FAO-PM) equation presents a procedure for computing
hourly or daily ET values using standard climatological measurements of solar radiation, air
temperature, humidity and wind speed made at a height of 2 m above a fully transpiring grass
surface [41]. These data can be obtained from automatic weather stations installed on a speciﬁc ﬁeld or
from a metrological network. The equation provides a basis from which reference ET (ET from the
well-watered grass surface) for different time periods can be calculated and to which ET from other
crops can be computed using crop coefﬁcients, Kc [66]. The crop coefﬁcients are speciﬁc to each crop
and crop canopy cover, which is dependent on the crop growth stage. The Kc curve deﬁned for a crop
over its growth stage is generalized for regions with similar climates. The Kc is however dependent on
the canopy dynamics including cover fraction, leaf area index and greenness which may vary across
regions with similar climates [67]. This introduces errors into ET estimates derived using the standard
FAO-PM crop coefﬁcient approach. The FAO-PM method presents a relatively easy procedure for
determining the temporal dynamics of crop water use. The crop coefﬁcient used in determining the
actual ET of a particular crop however needs to be estimated at each growth stage. It is noted in
Allen et al. [41] that reference ET can be overestimated by as much as 20% during conditions of low
evaporative demand.
Remote sensing provides a means of overcoming the shortcomings of the FAO-PM crop coefﬁcient
approach of estimating crop ET by providing real-time feedback on daily crop water use as inﬂuenced
by actual crop canopy dynamics, local climatic conditions and ﬁeld spatial variability [68]. The remotely
sensed normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) computed from crop canopy reﬂectance
measurements in the red and near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths has been found to be a useful tool in
computing accurate crop coefﬁcients for a broad range of crops [69]. Singh et al. [70] has demonstrated
the use of the calculated reference ET and the remotely sensed NDVI in estimating the water use of
cotton. A similar procedure has also been demonstrated by Farg et al. [67] for estimating the daily
water use of wheat.
The surface renewal analysis method presents an opportunity for assessing the real-time temporal
dynamics of crop water use. The surface renewal (SR) method is used to determine the sensible heat
which can then be applied to the energy balance equation to determine the latent heat (i.e., ET) [71]. It is
based on analyzing the temperature time series generated from monitoring the change in heat content
of air parcels that interact with the crop canopy. When an air parcel comes in contact with the crop
canopy, the air temperature remains constant for a brief time period known as the quiescent period.
The temperature of the air parcel however increases after this time period as energy is transferred
to it from the crop canopy. The increase in temperature continues until the air parcel is replaced by
cooler air from the atmosphere. At this time, the temperature of the air shows a sharp drop [72].
A high frequency trace of this temperature renewal event exhibits a ramp-like function. Applying
Sustainability 2017, 9, 353
9 of 29
structure function theory to the ramp function enables the determination of the sensible heat ﬂux.
The instrumentation requirement for an SR system is minimal, consisting of small diameter ﬁne wire
thermocouples or a two-dimensional sonic anemometer and a high frequency data acquisition system
(2 Hz to 10 Hz) [71]. Standard climatological measurements are also required to obtain the other
parameters in the energy balance equation.
The SR technique requires that measurements are taken at a minimum height above the crop
canopy. It is assumed that the canopy is homogeneous and able to absorb all the momentum transferred
to it by the ambient airﬂow [73]. This assumption introduces errors in ET estimates over ﬁelds
with variable canopy structures. Castellvi and Snyder [74] concluded that the technique can be
applied for estimating ET from short and dense canopy crops as they are mostly decoupled from
the environment. The technique also requires calibration using an eddy covariance system or a
lysimeter. This may limit its practicality for farm-scale deployment. The SR methodology proposed by
Castellvi [75], however, does not require calibration. Rosa and Tanny [76], Shapland and Snyder [72],
and Rosa et al. [77] have reported highly accurate hourly ET estimates from various crops using a
surface renewal analysis system.
5.4. Plant-Based Sensing
The importance of plant-based monitoring becomes emphasized when studying the effect of
water deﬁcit on plants and its relation to plant water status. The temporal dynamics of crop water use
can be monitored using a number of plant-based methods. They include methods that require direct
contact with the plant and those that require only proximal contact with the plants [78]. The contact
sensors are useful in monitoring the temporal dynamics of the plant water status while the proximal
sensors are capable of assessing the spatial nature of crop water status across a ﬁeld and hence
well suited for the precision irrigation process [11]. A good understanding of the various aspects of
plant water status and plant drought physiology is important in the successful application of these
systems. Readers are directed to [79,80] for a comprehensive overview of plant-based sensing methods
applicable in irrigation management. Plant-based sensing systems measure either the plant water
content, plant water potential or the plant physiological response to moisture deﬁcits. A summary of
various plant-based sensing systems is given in Table 2. It should be noted that many of these require
skilled manpower and considerable management time for their operation.

5.5. Thermal Sensing
Plant canopy temperature is a widely accepted variable indicative of plant water status.
The stomata controls evaporative cooling of the leaves based on soil water status and prevailing
environmental conditions.
It closes due to increased water deﬁcits and a reduction in plant
transpiration causing an increase in plant canopy temperature [91]. The measurement of the crop
canopy temperature by infrared thermometry which is then normalized using an index such as the
crop water stress index (CWSI) can be used in determining the plant water status and its response to
water deﬁcits [79].
The CWSI is a well-established method of accounting for the variation in canopy temperature as
a function of prevailing microclimatological conditions and water deﬁcits [92]. It relates the difference
in the crop canopy temperature measured using infrared thermometry to the air temperature as a
function of atmospheric vapor deﬁcit [93]. This temperature difference is then related to an upper
and lower temperature baseline to determine a water stress index. The upper baseline represents
a non-transpiring crop and the lower baseline represents a fully transpiring crop under the same
prevailing environmental condition [30]. The CWSI is a dimensionless value of between 0 and 1, with a
value of 0 indicating a well-watered crop and a value of 1 indicating a severely water-stressed crop [93].
Biotic factors can also induce stress in a plant thus affecting transpiration rate, crop water use and
canopy temperature. These biotic factors also affect leaf colour and morphology which in turn affects
the optical properties of the crop canopy [94]. In order to successfully apply infrared thermometry as a
tool for assessing plant water status, it is important to differentiate between abiotic (such as water stress)
and biotic stresses (such as plant diseases and pest infestation). Multiband optical sensors could be
applied in detecting various crop diseases and crop infestation within a ﬁeld by computing vegetation
indices based on canopy reﬂectance measurements [33]. This has been applied by Garcia-Ruiz et al. [95]
for detecting citrus greening and by Yang et al. [96] for detecting infestation of green bugs and aphids
in wheat. It may be useful to outﬁt precision irrigation systems with these sensors.
The main advantage of thermal sensing for precision irrigation application is related to the
non-contact and real-time capability of the system. Infrared thermometry and thermography provide
the opportunity to map the spatial variation in crop water status which can guide in variable rate
irrigation management. The use of thermal sensing for guiding zone-speciﬁc water application has
been demonstrated as noted in Section 2.
A major problem faced in applying the thermal sensing approach is the establishment of the
baseline temperatures. In climates in which the air humidity is often high, variations in wind speed and
net radiation introduce signiﬁcant errors in the estimation of the lower limit baseline temperature [97].
A number of studies have been conducted to develop procedures for enhancing the possibility of
applying measurements of crop canopy temperature in inferring plant water status in humid regions.
Jones [98] provides an excellent summary of these research efforts. They include the use of well-watered
plots to substitute for empirical non-water stressed baselines, although these well-watered plots are
rarely available in practice. The use of artiﬁcial reference surfaces for measuring baseline temperatures
has been proposed but it is reported that these artiﬁcial reference surfaces differ signiﬁcantly in thermal
and radiative properties in comparison to real leaves. A modeling approach to simulating the canopy
resistance of well-watered plants has also been investigated but this is limited by the difﬁculties
encountered in correctly modeling stomata behavior and hence canopy resistance. The possibility
of including a wide range of metrological data including net radiation and vapor pressure deﬁcit in
deriving CWSI models for humid climates has also been investigated. The mathematical complexity
typical of the models however limit their practical application.
Another problem commonly encountered in applying infrared measurements of canopy
temperature in inferring plant water status is the inclusion of soil temperature and other background
temperature including the sky and stems in the measured canopy temperature. This usually leads to
errors in estimation of the canopy temperature as the soil and background temperature are usually
many degrees different from the canopy temperature [90]. Jones [99] proposed the use of narrow
Sustainability 2017, 9, 353
11 of 29
acceptance angle infrared sensors that can be positioned to view only single leaves as a solution to this
problem. It has however been found that the temperature estimates of single leaves determined
by this method is mostly not representative of the temperature of the plant canopy.
A dense
deployment of infrared sensors may seem an alternative but this may be prohibitive in terms of
cost for practical applications.
The advancements in the ﬁeld of thermal imagery and the recent availability of low-cost thermal
cameras has presented the possibility of overcoming the problems associated with the inclusion of
soil and background temperatures in the measured canopy temperature. Thermal imagery allows
for the average temperature of a deﬁned area to be obtained and also the separation of background
temperature from the area of interest. The temperature of a large number of individual leaves
making up a canopy can be included in an image while the soil and background temperature can be
discarded by applying automated image processing techniques [92]. Gonzalez-Dugo et al. [100] has
demonstrated the use of thermal imagery in mapping the crop water status in a commercial orchard
in Spain. They also demonstrated the rapid mapping of ﬁeld-scale crop water status by deploying
thermal imaging equipment on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).
Plant-based sensing methods including thermal sensing only provide information on the need for
irrigation and provide no information on the volume of irrigation application needed. They are used
in combination with soil-based sensing for this reason [19].
6. Decision Support
A decision support system for irrigation management and scheduling provides a framework
for incorporating various tools and techniques for site-speciﬁc irrigation decisions. The widespread
commercial adoption of precision irrigation will be predicated on the development of robust and
optimal decision support systems [19].
A number of decision support systems schedule irrigation at predeﬁned intervals and apply
predeﬁned irrigation volumes. They do not incorporate any form of sensor feedback on plant water
status, soil water status and climatic variables [101]. This ‘open-loop’ strategy is largely designed based
on heuristics and historical data. Mareels et al. [102] suggested that this is an inefﬁcient approach often
leading to overwatering and waste of fertilizer and other supplemental crop inputs.
Closed-loop irrigation strategies aim to irrigate: when the soil moisture content reaches a certain
threshold [103–105]; when plant sensors indicate a certain stress threshold [93,106,107] or with feedback
from crop simulation models with the aim of attaining a certain yield, crop physiological response or
economic objective [108]. These closed-loop irrigation strategies have been shown to improve water
use efﬁciency in the production of horticultural crops under protected environments. Environmental
conditions in such production systems can be controlled based on plant feedback which eliminates the
stochastic plant response often encountered in ﬁeld-scale crop production [109]. Belayneh et al. [110]
implemented a wireless sensor network of soil moisture sensors for closed-loop irrigation control in
a pot-in-pot nursery. A signiﬁcant reduction in water use was achieved by the system. The authors
also reported a 2.7-year payback period for the system. Chappell et al. [111] reported water savings of
83% for a closed-loop irrigation control system implemented in a protected crop production system.
They noted that there was less occurrence of plant diseases in the nursery due to the elimination of
over-watering. Saavoss et al. [112] reported a 65% increase in proﬁt due to the implementation of a
wireless sensor network-based closed-loop control system in a nursery. The authors noted that the
increase in proﬁt was due to improvement in crop quality and yield resulting from the precise control
of irrigation applications.
In ﬁeld-scale crop production, the crop needs vary over time and space due to both biotic and
abiotic factors [9]. McCarthy et al. [113] noted that in these crop production systems, closed-loop
strategies are unable to account for unknown crop dynamics, the stochastic nature of climatic variables
and crop response, and the time-varying nature of the soil-plant-atmosphere system. This last
point is especially due to crop growth, crop management and infestation of pests and diseases.
Sustainability 2017, 9, 353

The closed-loop systems are also unable to consider equipment and other operational limitations.
McCarthy et al. [114] concluded that an optimal decision support system must be ‘adaptive’ with
the ability of accommodating the temporal and spatial variability within the ﬁeld. The decision
support system must also have the capability of modifying irrigation decisions in response to crop
physiology, uncertainties in climatic inputs, soil, irrigation systems and water supply limitations,
economic considerations and the quality of sensor feedback.
6.1. Adaptive Decision Support
The characteristics of a cropping system varies over time. Within a cropped system, the properties
that will typically vary within and between seasons include crop growth, soil properties (due to
addition of nutrients and other management processes) and climate. This will have a direct inﬂuence
on the irrigation timing and volume required for optimal crop growth [11].
An adaptive decision support system is able to continuously re-adjust the irrigation scheduling
algorithm in order to retain the desired performance of the irrigation system [114]. The adaptive
decision support system is able to utilize historical or real-time sensor data to arrive at irrigation
timing and volume that adequately accounts for the temporal and spatial variability in the ﬁeld [114].
In control theory an adaptive control system is generally accepted as a control system able to adjust
its controller parameters based on sensor feedback from a process, such that the controlled process
behaves in a desirable way [11]. McCarthy et al. [108] noted that an adaptive decision support system
for irrigation may either be sensor-based if they use direct sensor measurements for the irrigation
strategy or model-based if they use a calibrated simulation model to aid irrigation decisions.
The development of adaptive decision support systems presents an opportunity to improve
sustainability in precision irrigation through improved water use and crop productivity. They will
also enhance synergistic applications of data available from soil, plant and weather sensors to arrive at
optimal irrigation scheduling decisions [108].
In this section we will present a brief discussion on state-of-the-art of adaptive decision support
systems. We will thereafter discuss the opportunities these systems present in improving sustainability
in irrigated agriculture. Readers are referred to [113] for a comprehensive overview on the application
of advanced process control to irrigation, details on methods of operation and a consideration of
fundamental control concepts as they apply to irrigation scheduling.
6.1.1. Mechanistic Models
A number of irrigation decision support systems are based on complex physical models which
closely resemble the actual physical system [115]. They are able to incorporate the physiological and
morphological representation of the plant into the decision support tool. Barnard and Bauerle [116]
described an irrigation scheduling system based on the spatially explicit biophysical model, MAESTRA
(Multi-Array Evaporation Stand Tree Radiation A), which couples the within-canopy photosynthesis
and stomatal conductance. Data on leaf temperature, canopy aerodynamics and environmental
variables are used as inputs into the model to predict the plant transpiration. They reported that
the model-based tool applied between 18% and 56% more water than a sensing-based method for
scheduling irrigation in four species. They, however, noted that the model-based approach produced
greater tree growth. Asher et al. [117] described a mechanistic model capable of inferring crop water
requirements. The model employs leaf temperature data as input for determining the crop aerodynamic
characteristics which is then used in the Penman–Monteith equation for calculating the actual crop
ET. A major drawback of these mechanistic models is that they include static parameters which, once
identiﬁed, are assumed to remain constant over the cropping season. This is rarely so in practice as the
cropping system varies over time due to both biotic and abiotic factors.

6.1.2. Simulations
Crop simulation models based on ﬁrst principle physical models of crop phenology, soil physics
and hydrology can be applied in simulating the crop response to irrigation and cropping system
management [115]. These simulation models provide the opportunity to evaluate the beneﬁt of several
precision irrigation strategies as they eliminate the need for time-consuming ﬁeld experiments [118].
They can be interfaced with real-time sensor feedback from soil or plant sensors and weather data to
determine daily irrigation requirements of crops. They can also be used in predicting the yield impact
of an irrigation strategy. This is achieved by employing weather forecast data in computing a daily soil
moisture balance and assessing the impact of soil moisture deﬁcits on crop growth [118].
DeJonge et al. [14] investigated the effect of variable rate irrigation management on corn
production in Iowa using the CERES-maize model. Corn yield was compared for a period of 28 years
under simulated scenarios of no irrigation, scheduled uniform irrigation and precision irrigation. They
reported no signiﬁcant difference in corn yield and water use between the uniform irrigation and
precision irrigation scenarios. Thorp et al. [24] described a methodology for applying the Decision
Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) crop growth model in analyzing variable rate
management practices including irrigation on crop growth and yield. The platform enabled the
evaluation of precision irrigation strategies on crop performance in predeﬁned management zones.
These systems are however incapable of real-time decision support and can only be applied using
historical data.
McCarthy et al. [114] proposed a simulation framework, VARIwise, capable of real-time decision
support in precision irrigation. The simulation framework is capable of incorporating real-time data
input from ﬁeld sensors in arriving at irrigation decisions. The combination of different sensor inputs
into the simulation framework enables adaptive decision support with the system being able to
re-adjust irrigation decisions based on plant feedback and also explore optimal control strategies.
Simulation models for use in irrigation decision support require extensive calibration and
validation to establish model accuracy. The limitation in data available for this endeavour often
limit the use of the platforms to speciﬁc crops.
6.1.3. Artiﬁcial Intelligence
Artiﬁcial intelligence presents the potential of solving problems in precision irrigation which
are complex, non-linear and ill-deﬁned [119]. Artiﬁcial intelligence algorithms are able to emulate
the human decision-making process when applied to a particular problem domain. They have been
deployed for implementing adaptive decision support in irrigation in form of artiﬁcial neural networks,
fuzzy logic and expert systems with mixed success to date [118–120].
Artiﬁcial Neural Networks
Artiﬁcial neural networks (ANN) are non-linear mapping structures employed in modeling when
the underlying data relationship is not well deﬁned. ANN are able to identify and learn correlations
between input data and corresponding target output values. They are able to predict the outcome of
new independent data sets making them a useful tool in predictive modeling [121]. ANN are well
suited for the irrigation decision support problem that can often be complex and stochastic in nature.
These networks are also adaptive in nature and are able to continuously learn in order to provide
optimal solutions to target problems in dynamic systems.
Karasekreter et al. [122] implemented an ANN for scheduling irrigation in a strawberry orchard
using soil moisture and its physical properties as model inputs. The system was able to achieve water
savings of 20.5% and an energy saving of 23.9%. ANN however require large datasets for training and
are unable to describe the physical dynamics of a system. This makes their use limited in real-time
decision support tools.
Sustainability 2017, 9, 353

Fuzzy Logic
Fuzzy logic is an artificial intelligence algorithm that can be used to model a process and relate it
to human experience in arriving at decisions. A fuzzy logic system is made up of a set used to classify
input data into membership classes, a decision rule that is applied to each set which culminates in a
human-like decision output from the system [123]. A detailed description of the process is given in [124].
Mousa and Abdullah [123] successfully applied a fuzzy logic model in scheduling irrigation in
drip and sprinkler irrigation systems using ET, soil moisture data and crop growth stage as model
inputs. Prakashgoud and Desai [124] employed a fuzzy logic system using soil moisture data, leaf
wetness and climatological data as model inputs in order to implement irrigation scheduling decisions.
The system was capable of maintaining soil moisture thresholds in the speciﬁed range. Giusti and
Marsili-Libelli [125] described an adaptive irrigation decision support system implemented with fuzzy
logic. The system incorporates a predictive model of the soil moisture and an inference system for
maintaining the soil moisture within an acceptable threshold. The system was reported to adapt
irrigation decisions to rainfall uncertainty and produced water savings of 13.55% over a simulation
period of 168 days.
The accuracy of fuzzy logic systems is largely tied to an in-depth knowledge of the system. They
also lack an inner mechanistic structure with the domain of applicability limited to the range of training
data used in setting them up. Delgoda et al. [115] suggested that the points mentioned makes decision
making with a fuzzy system an ad hoc process limiting its application in adaptive decision support.
Expert Systems
An expert system is a tool able to emulate the reasoning process a human expert would employ
in a decision-making process in his/her ﬁeld of expertise. It captures the human decision-making
expertise and heuristics representing it in a series of rules and facts [126]. An expert system typically
consists of a knowledge base component and an inference engine that acts as a reasoning tool [127].
Expert systems are especially suited to dynamic problems that are of a complex nature. They are also
well suited to dealing with incomplete and uncertain data [128]. This makes them well suited for
irrigation decision support which often requires the input of experts to arrive at optimal decisions.
Expert systems applied in irrigation decision support can be classiﬁed as either ‘expert systems
proper’ or hybrid expert systems. A detailed review on the application of expert systems in irrigation
decision support is given in [128,129]. The ‘expert systems proper’ class of irrigation decision support
tools schedule irrigation based on soil moisture and climatic data. They are unable to consider the
time-varying nature of the cropping system (crop growth, disease and pest infestation) to arrive at
optimal irrigation decisions. They are also unable to account for the stochastic nature of climatic
variables and are not well suited for real-time applications [129].
Hybrid expert systems which are also referred to as model-based expert systems combine
algorithmic techniques and a knowledge-based component in solving problems relevant to its
application domain. Its advantage in irrigation is that optimal irrigation decision can be made
by combining expert knowledge with data feedback from inﬁeld sensors, data-driven models and crop
simulation models [130]. Thomson and Ross [131] described a model-based expert system designed
for decision support in irrigation management. The system employs feedback from soil moisture
sensors to adjust the input of a crop simulation model, PNUTGRO (peanut crop growth simulation
model), and also incorporates the capability of sensor feedback validation. The system was reported
to maintain soil moisture at the deﬁned thresholds. Goumopoulos et al. [38] developed an expert
system-based adaptive decision support platform for zone-speciﬁc irrigation of strawberry plants.
The system includes a wireless sensor network of soil, climate and plant sensors providing feedback
for the decision support system. It also includes a machine learning process capable of inferring new
rules and extending the knowledge base from logged data sets. The system was reported to reduce
irrigation water consumption by around 20%. A hybrid expert system based on real-time soil moisture
data with the capability of incorporating plant models is described in Kohanbash et al. [132].
Sustainability 2017, 9, 353

The performance of an expert system is largely dependent on the effectiveness of the knowledge
acquisition process. An error in this process will drastically affect the system reliability and its performance.
6.1.4. Learning Control
Learning control decision support strategies perform systems identiﬁcation using sensor feedback
without deﬁning a mathematical model [113]. Systems identiﬁcation models a dynamic system based
on a time series of measured input/output data [133]. A comprehensive overview on the theory of
systems identiﬁcation is presented in [134].
Iterative learning control can be applied in systems with ill-deﬁned models that operate
repetitively and assume the same initial condition after each iteration.
It is well suited to the
irrigation problem as irrigation scheduling and application is a repetitive problem over the crop
season. The time-varying nature of the soil–plant–atmosphere system can also be viewed as an
ill-deﬁned problem. The strategy is also able to improve system performance by eliminating the effects
of a repeating disturbance with undeﬁned dynamics. Applied to irrigation, this may be a measured
crop response that reoccurs as a consequence of irrigation. The temporal changes in crop water use
and weather conditions are not considered [113].
McCarthy et al. [114] noted that a drawback of the iterative learning approach may be the
inefﬁcient systems identiﬁcation resulting from the slow system dynamics of the crop system in
response to irrigation events. This results from the evaluation of the effect of only one irrigation
volume on plant response at any water application event. They suggested that this drawback may be
eliminated by applying the process of iterative hill climbing control. This learning control strategy
employs an adaptive varied identiﬁcation process. A range of irrigation volumes are applied at each
irrigation event to a number of test cells on the ﬁeld. The response in the test cell that best matches
the desired system performance is identiﬁed as the optimal irrigation process. They reported that
the iterative hill climbing control procedure was capable of maximizing cotton yield when used
with a combination of plant and soil sensors to provide feedback for the identiﬁcation procedure.
Their conclusions were however based on results from a simulation study and a ﬁeld-based validation
of the procedure was not reported.
The results of the learning control procedure are based solely on sensor measurements and may be
largely affected by sensor drift as a model of the crop response is not developed from the identiﬁcation
procedure. This method can be considered more of a “brute force” approach than a scientiﬁcally based
approach to scheduling irrigation.
6.1.5. Model Predictive Control
Model predictive control (MPC) is an industrial control approach employed in decision support
for large-scale multivariable problems with multiple constraints. It has been successfully implemented
in the food industry, petrochemical industry and power generation among others [135]. Model
predictive control employs a plant model and optimization algorithm to calculate plant inputs in order
to achieve a future value of a performance criterion. The system performance is predicted over a ﬁnite
horizon subject to constraints on both the inputs and outputs of the plant [101]. Readers are directed
to [135–137] for an in-depth review of the theory of model predictive control and its application in
various industries.
In the case of irrigation, applying a soil moisture balance model, the plant input will be the
irrigation amount, the plant output will be the soil moisture deﬁcit, and both crop ET and precipitation
values will be considered as disturbances as they cannot be controlled. A prediction of future input
values and disturbances is required in an MPC system in order to determine the optimal system
output [138]. This highlights the need for the incorporation of weather forecast data into the MPC
framework for irrigation decision support.
Model predictive control appears to be well suited to the domain of irrigation decision support.
The irrigation problem has input constraints in terms of optimal irrigation volume and output
Sustainability 2017, 9, 353
16 of 29
constraints in terms of soil moisture thresholds and the desired plant response to water deﬁcits [135].
Ooi et al. [139], Lozoya et al. [101] and Saleem et al. [135] described a model predictive control
framework for irrigation scheduling based on a soil moisture balance model. They employed a
system identiﬁcation procedure to generate a grey box model of the soil–plant–atmosphere system
with a network of soil moisture sensors providing real-time feedback to the control algorithm. They
all reported the ability of the MPC platform to sufﬁciently predict crop irrigation needs and also
observations of signiﬁcant water savings. The authors of the discussed systems however fail to account
for the stochastic nature of rainfall and crop water use in the system dynamics. Delgoda et al. [138]
noted that an adequate consideration of the uncertainty in rainfall and ET inputs into the water balance
model employed in the MPC framework will improve the capability of the MPC system.
Delgoda et al. [115] addressed the drawbacks noted in the above MPC frameworks by employing
disturbance afﬁne feedback control, an uncertainty modelling technique widely applied in MPC
to account for the stochastic nature of rainfall and crop water use. A simple order model of soil
moisture dynamics is included in the system to enable online calculation of model parameters, hence
accounting for the time-varying nature of soil-plant-atmosphere system. The authors reported an
optimal performance of the system in humid regions where considerable uncertainties in climatic
variables exist.
6.2. Commercial Sensor Applications in Adaptive Decision Support
Manufacturers of sensors and a number of system integrators are showing considerable interest
in developing innovative tools that will further optimize irrigation water use.
A sensor integration project is described by AgSmarts (Memphis, TN, USA). Moving irrigation
systems are equipped with sensors which provide data on crop growth stage and soil proﬁle. Aquaspy
soil moisture sensors (San Diego, CA, USA) positioned in various parts of the ﬁeld also provide data
on soil moisture status which is applied in irrigation timing and calculation of irrigation volumes.
These irrigation decisions are automatically adjusted based on the varying water requirements at each
crop growth stage [140].
Omica, Italy has deployed a wireless sensor network of Libelium environmental and soil moisture
sensors (Zaragoza, Spain) on a maize farm in Italy to support irrigation decisions. The sensors
are interfaced to a geo-referenced decision support system which enables zone-speciﬁc irrigation
management. The system is able to predict crop yield based on irrigation timing and application
volumes combined with historical yield data. This can then be applied in optimizing the decision
support system towards achieving a desired crop yield goal.
Most decision support systems presently produced for commercial use provide on/off irrigation
control based on speciﬁed thresholds and plant/crop sensor feedback. The incorporation of predictive
models into these systems will enhance the possibility of improving irrigation water use and crop
yield [141].
7. Opportunities for Improving Sustainability
Sustainability is premised on the principle of meeting the needs of the present generation without
compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Sustainable agriculture is
focused on developing farming practices that are safe and do not have an adverse impact on the
environment [142].
Pretty [143] suggested that sustainable agriculture integrates the main goals of environmental
health and economic proﬁtability. The efﬁcient and effective use of water is considered the main driver
for improving sustainability in irrigated agriculture. This will involve the use of less water for irrigating
crops and also preserving the quality of water sources. Conventional irrigation practices apply water
uniformly over a ﬁeld resulting in a high volume of water use. Overirrigation may also result from
this practice which causes leaching of nitrates and nutrients into ground water sources. An important
consideration would also be the use of less energy for operating water pumps and irrigation application
Sustainability 2017, 9, 353
17 of 29
equipment. Soil erosion continues to be a serious threat to sustainability in irrigated agriculture. This
can be eliminated by applying precise irrigation volumes to reduce surface runoff.
Precision irrigation presents a promising platform for improving sustainability in irrigated
agriculture. This is especially hinged on the possibility of eliminating the adverse environmental
impacts related to conventional irrigation practices with the adoption of precision irrigation.
The economic proﬁtability of the adoption of precision irrigation is however a very important point
to consider. This will be manifested in terms of improved crop yields and increased water savings
including the associated reduction in energy consumption resulting from the optimal matching of
irrigation inputs to the spatial water demands of the ﬁeld, thus reducing costs [11].
Precision irrigation is predicated on the hypothesis that the crop water requirements vary spatially
across a ﬁeld. In heterogeneous crops such as fruit orchards, this variability is also due to physiological
factors such as leaf area and fruit load [144]. It is assumed that varying water application across the ﬁeld
to meet this spatial crop water need will improve crop yield and reduce the costs of associated inputs.
Smith et al. [11] noted that the evidence to support this hypothesis in commercial crop production is
not readily found in literature.
Evans and King [18] reviewed much of the work prior to that date focused on analysing the
improvements in crop yield and water savings achievable with precision irrigation and suggested that
the greatest savings are likely to occur in humid climates by the increased utilization of stored moisture
and in-season precipitation. Results from simulation- and ﬁeld-based case studies they reviewed
showed water savings of 0% to 26% for well-watered crop production employing precision irrigation
strategies. No signiﬁcant improvements in crop yields resulting from the adoption of precision
irrigation were reported. They concluded that in arid and semi-arid regions, precision irrigation is
more suited to maximize net return rather than yield and it may have greater potential in reducing
irrigation water use in humid climates when irrigating to maximally utilize in-season precipitation.
They further noted that the economic beneﬁt of adopting precision irrigation for ﬁeld-scale crop
production is limited. This is because the cost of equipment, maintenance and management is much
greater than the revenue improvements achieved as a result of improved yield and water savings.
The payback period of implementing the technology may also exceed the useful life of the water
application equipment, typically placed at 15 years. A payback period ranging from 5 to 20 years is
noted in Smith et al. [11] for the adoption of precision irrigation for crop production in New Zealand.
Evans et al. [145] reviewed the adoption trends of spatially varied irrigation in the USA covering
a period of 20 years. They noted that about only 200 of the 175,000 moving irrigation systems in the
USA were ﬁtted with variable rate water application technology. They suggested higher net returns on
investment as a stimuli for adoption of precision irrigation by growers. Growers that had adopted the
technology reported no signiﬁcant savings in water and energy use in non-limiting water situations.
They noted that in more than 20 years of research pertaining to variable rate irrigation management,
the economic beneﬁt was yet to be demonstrated. This was attributed to the marginal water savings
(5%–15%) which is insufﬁcient to realize a payback for the initial investment in the water application
technology. They concluded that an economic strategy that optimizes net return rather than total
returns for the technology should be adopted as a long-term investment goal.
Heeren et al. [146] conducted a simulation study to assess the reductions in pumping costs
through the adoption of precision irrigation in 49,224 centre-pivot irrigated ﬁelds in Nebraska, USA.
The study focused on applying variable rate water applications in mining undepleted available water.
They noted that the reduction in pumping costs achieved from the adoption of precision irrigation
in all ﬁelds may be negligible in comparison to the cost of variable rate water application equipment.
They concluded that the adoption of this technology will be economically justiﬁable only with an
increase in energy costs.
An economic evaluation of spatially varied irrigation applications is presented in Lee [147].
The study assessed energy savings resulting from pumping lesser volumes of water for irrigation on
a 67-acre ﬁeld in Wyoming. The cost of installing the variable rate water application equipment on
Sustainability 2017, 9, 353
18 of 29
the ﬁeld was reported as $29,513 with a useful equipment life of 15 years. The yearly return for the
equipment based on energy savings achieved was computed as $1816.71, which equates to a payback
period of 16.25 years. This suggests that a payback will only be realized for the technology outside the
useful life of the equipment.
Precision irrigation offers the beneﬁt of providing water conservation beneﬁts by avoiding
overirrigation and the associated adverse environmental impacts [18]. Sadler et al. [148] discussed
water conservation strategies where precision irrigation can potentially reduce the total water applied
and improve the environmental quality of irrigated ﬁelds. They suggested that programing zero
irrigation amounts to non-cropped areas will improve water conservation using precision irrigation.
They also noted that adjusting spatial water application based on the inﬁltration rate of the soil and
soil water storage capacity will reduce the occurrence of surface runoff and soil erosion. Surface runoff
and leaching were identiﬁed as the major avenues for loss of nutrients from the soil. They suggested
the occurrence of this can be eliminated by spatial application of precise irrigation volumes based on
the soil water-holding characteristics. They presented several case studies in which the adoption of
precision irrigation has been demonstrated to enhance the environmental quality of irrigated ﬁelds.
They concluded that precision irrigation has the capability of improving water use efﬁciencies while
reducing the adverse environmental impacts associated with conventional irrigation practices.
The results from the above studies show that precision irrigation is a proven tool for improving
sustainability in irrigated agriculture in terms of enhancing environmental health. Its economic
justiﬁcation in terms of signiﬁcant yield improvements and water savings is however limited.
Evans and King [18] suggested that the lack of signiﬁcant improvements in yield response when
employing precision irrigation may result from the fact that the yield response to the water curve
near maximum yield (100% ET) is almost ﬂat, with small changes in water applied using precision
irrigation having little effect on yield. The majority of these precision irrigation studies have used only
soil data for irrigation management. The local microclimate and crop genetics may however have a
direct inﬂuence on the yield response of the crops.
Soil moisture status may also not provide a complete indication of crop water status, rather the
plant may be the best indicator of water availability. The decision support systems employed by
current precision irrigation systems assume that the soil–plant–atmosphere system never varies with
time. The characteristics of the crop, soil and climate vary within the season altering the timing and
optimal amount of irrigation volume required at any irrigation application event.
We argue that the incorporation of multiple sensed variables (plant, soil and weather data) will
enhance the possibility of arriving at optimal irrigation decisions and hence an improvement in
economic outcomes. This should be integrated with a decision support system that has the capability
to adapt to the time-varying nature of the cropping system. The decision support system should also
have the capacity to ‘learn’ in order to improve its performance based on experience and a target crop
production function. We discuss how this can be achieved by exploiting improvements in monitoring
and management considerations.
7.1. Monitoring Considerations
A precision irrigation system is designed to apply water at a differential rate in response to the
temporal and spatial variation in crop water need across a ﬁeld. This process is supported by a number
of sensors providing data to a real-time decision support system. These sensors include weather
stations, soil moisture sensors, environmental sensors, plant sensors and thermal sensors which may
be integrated into a wireless sensor network. A careful design of these sensing systems including a
consideration of factors affecting their performance is crucial in realizing the goal of improved water
use through precision irrigation.
Dielectric soil moisture sensors sense the water content of the immediate soil in their zone
of inﬂuence. The zone of inﬂuence reported for most commercial dielectric soil moisture sensors
corresponds to a cylindrical measurement volume of 1.5 L [149]. It is therefore important to install
Sustainability 2017, 9, 353
19 of 29
the sensors in areas representative of the soil moisture available for plant use. The normal practice
employed by most users is to place the sensors in the driest regions of the ﬁeld or in the regions
comprising of a soil proﬁle with the lowest available water-holding capacity [150]. Adopting this
approach will most likely lead to wetter regions in the ﬁeld receiving more frequent irrigation which
will consequently result in overirrigation. A more efﬁcient approach is to deﬁne irrigation management
zones and place a number of sensors in each management zone to give the average soil moisture
estimate. This may however be limited by cost.
A structured installation proﬁle is also necessary in order to capture soil water movement and
availability. It is recommended that sensors should be installed at each soil horizon along the plant
rooting zone [151]. An accepted convention is the installation of sensors at three to four depths along
the rooting zone (1 per 25% of total rooting depth). The sensor located on the uppermost soil proﬁle
is able to detect precipitation events, the sensor in the deepest part of the proﬁle is able to detect
drainage and the other sensors located midway in the soil proﬁle are able to capture soil moisture
dynamics useful in supporting irrigation scheduling decisions [152]. The variation in soil properties
at the different rooting depths should also be taken into account. With an increasing knowledge of
the site, it is usually possible to install the sensors at two depths and still adequately capture the soil
moisture dynamics. The soil moisture sensors should also be deployed using soil-speciﬁc calibration
equations to enable accurate estimates of soil moisture content.
The actual crop evapotranspiration can vary spatially and temporally under conditions of
unrestricted water supply. These variations can be the result of several factors including differences
in crop genetics, plant density, weed competition, pest intensity, nutrient availability and stage of
growth [18]. Addressing the variation in ET across a ﬁeld may result in signiﬁcant water savings.
The accurate measurement of evapotranspiration is crucial in arriving at optimal irrigation
decisions [71]. The FAO-PM procedure for calculating ET which is applied in many precision irrigation
systems relies on information from weather stations applied in calculating a reference ET which is
adjusted for speciﬁc crops using crop coefﬁcients. This calculated ET is assumed to be uniform for every
part of the ﬁeld. This will however result in the application of inaccurate irrigation volumes to replace
crop water use, owing to the spatial nature of the actual ET. The application of the NDVI technique
in determining site-speciﬁc crop coefﬁcients provides a platform for overcoming this challenge.
The surface renewal analysis procedure also presents a promising tool for quantifying the actual
crop ET. It is however best suited to homogeneous, short and dense canopies.
Plant-based measurements provide the best indication of plant water status as they provide a direct
measure of the plants’ response to soil moisture availability and climatic demand. An efficient plant-based
monitoring system should however respond sensitively to the slightest change in water deficits.
Measurements of leaf water potential and sap ﬂow are contact methods which give direct
information on plant water status but their spatial resolution is limited as many samples are required
to effectively monitor the dynamics of ﬁeld-scale plant water status [153]. Infrared thermometry has
provided a robust platform for assessing plant water status. The (CWSI calculated from the infrared
measurements of crop canopy temperature can adequately quantify ﬁeld-scale crop water status with
high spatial and temporal resolution. This presents a robust and cost-effective tool for use in precision
irrigation. Its application in humid regions is however marred with difﬁculties.
A systems engineering approach can be applied in overcoming the difficulties encountered with
applying the CWSI in humid climates. A mathematical model derived using this approach may adequately
simulate the real-time dynamics of the baseline temperatures required for computing the index.
A summary of the technology gaps and reﬁnements necessary in monitoring tools in order to
achieve robust precision irrigation management is presented in [11]. They include the limited volume
of inﬂuence, high cost and the need to improve the measurement accuracy of soil moisture sensors.
The reﬁnements recommended include the development of low cost soil measurement sensors with
a wider volume of inﬂuence, low cost and resilient wireless communication networks able to link
spatially deployed soil moisture sensors and the development of smart calibration software in order
Sustainability 2017, 9, 353
20 of 29
to improve the accuracy of soil moisture sensors. The technology gaps identiﬁed in plant sensing
technology include the limited knowledge of irrigation thresholds and quantity, and low spatial
resolution. The reﬁnements recommended include the integration of plant-based sensing with soil
moisture sensing tools in order to determine irrigation volumes, calibration of infra-red thermography
against physiologically explicit plant measurements in order to determine critical thresholds and the
deployment of IR thermography tools on low altitude UAVs to further enhance spatial coverage.
A combination of multiple sensor inputs deployed at a density that captures spatial variability
is therefore likely to yield the most robust and accurate solution for precision irrigation. This will
ensure that the decision support system is robust to data availability, gaps and deﬁciencies. This will
include data from soil, weather and plant sensors [11]. An important consideration will also include
developing cost-effective and user-friendly tools which will enhance the adoption of these adaptive
systems by farmers.
7.2. Management Considerations
Management can perhaps be viewed as the most vital aspect of a precision irrigation system.
Management acts as an interface between monitoring and decision support, culminating into irrigation
decisions. This enables the implementation of vital management decisions of when and where to
apply irrigation and also the irrigation volumes to be applied. The decision support system is perhaps
the management backbone of a precision irrigation system and its proper implementation is vital for
improving sustainability in irrigated agriculture.
The adaptive decision support tools discussed have the capability of improving crop yield and
water savings when deployed as part of a precision irrigation system. Smith et al. [11] noted that
the simulation of adaptive decision support strategies can be used in identifying optimal irrigation
scheduling decisions. A simulation tool capable of representing a range of ﬁeld conditions at different
spatial and temporal scales is considered ideal. Such a simulation framework is presented in [114].
Model-based decision support systems using feedback from multiple sensors may present a
platform for arriving at optimal water applications. MPC appears to be ideally suited for achieving the
aim of improving sustainability in irrigated agriculture. A decision support system based on MPC
employs an optimization algorithm to implement an input strategy with the best performance.
McCarthy et al. [113] noted that MPC implemented for a precision irrigation system could involve
the use of real-time data from ﬁeld sensors to calibrate a crop or soil model and then optimizing this
calibrated model to arrive at optimal irrigation scheduling decisions. A combination of data from soil
moisture sensors, thermal sensors and weather sensors would be appropriate for MPC. The data from
the sensors would most likely be required daily, as measurements are not required at a high temporal
resolution to calibrate the model. A dense deployment of these sensors is however required to account
for the spatial nature of ﬁeld-scale crop water use. The thermal sensors may be mounted on a moving
platform for spatial data collection across the ﬁeld.
Equipment availability, irrigation system capacity and other operational considerations can be
incorporated as system-level constraints in an MPC-based decision support system. These constraints
can be considered to arrive at future irrigation scheduling decisions [113].
MPC uses a model’s simulation to determine the optimum irrigation application timing and
volume. When combined with a soft sensing system, variables that are not directly measured can be
controlled and optimized. This presents a possibility of applying decision support systems based on
MPC in realising a desired crop yield and also a water-saving goal [136].
There has been considerable research into water use procedures that can achieve improved water
savings in irrigated agriculture, particularly deﬁcit irrigation. Deﬁcit irrigation (DI) is an irrigation
strategy in which a crop is exposed to a level of water stress at certain growth stages in its development
(regulated deﬁcit irrigation) or throughout its growth season. The growth stage in which the plant is
subjected to water stress is predetermined as a drought tolerant stage. The goal of deﬁcit irrigation is
that there will be little adverse effect on yield and irrigation water can be conserved [154]. Evans and
Sustainability 2017, 9, 353

King [18] suggested deﬁcit irrigation as a tool for improving water use in precision irrigation. They
noted that it can be applied in maximizing net returns and conserve large amounts of water in arid
and semi-arid regions.
It is however important to investigate the response of different crops to water deﬁcits including
timing tolerances in order to develop optimal deﬁcit irrigation strategies that can be integrated into
the precision irrigation decision support framework. It is also important to investigate the economics
of yield reduction associated with deﬁcit irrigation strategies. O’Shaughnessy et al. [33] suggested that
implementing deﬁcit irrigation as part of precision irrigation management will involve the continuous
assessment of crop stress and growth stage throughout the growing season. This will be instrumental in
avoiding temporary severe stress which could result in uneconomic reduction in crop yield or quality.
The high cost of the component technologies of precision irrigation including soil, plant and
weather sensors, decision support systems and variable rate water application systems is presently
a constraint to the wide-scale adoption of this technology by farmers [148]. The minimal yield
improvements and water savings currently achieved through ﬁeld-scale precision irrigation may
not justify the initial capital investment required for its adoption. As fresh water resources become
scarcer, it is expected that more premium will be placed on water abstracted for irrigated agriculture.
Regulatory agencies may also require farmers to continuously demonstrate the efﬁcient use of water.
These factors may promote the adoption of precision irrigation by farmers [155].
A conceptual model-based decision support system that uses the full range of plant, weather and
soil data for irrigation management is illustrated in Figure 1. This is currently being developed by the
authors. It involves the integration of various sensing systems, dynamic modeling, machine learning
and model predictive control into an adaptive decision support system for precision irrigation.

8. Conclusions
Technological innovations that can improve sustainability in irrigated agriculture form an
important vehicle for actualizing the optimal use of limited water resources. Precision irrigation
has been demonstrated as such an innovation, though presently the economic beneﬁt related to
the adoption of this technology at ﬁeld-scale crop production is minimal.
This is because the
potential for yield improvements and water savings may not cover the cost of technology required for
its implementation.
The application of adaptive control techniques to irrigation decision support and improvements
in monitoring tools has the capability of dealing with the time-varying and stochastic nature of the
soil–plant–atmosphere system while also considering operational limitations in arriving at optimal
irrigation decisions. This ultimately presents a platform for actualizing the environmental and
economic goals of sustainability in irrigated agriculture.
A robust design of monitoring tools including a proper combination of soil, weather and plant
sensors is however vital for the proper operation of an adaptive decision support system. The decision
support system should be able to account for the varying crop water requirements within season as a
result of both biotic and abiotic factors. The decision support system should also consider agronomic
objectives to ensure the optimal irrigation strategy is delivered by the precision irrigation system.
The high cost of sensors and the requirement for dense deployment in order to obtain data at
high spatial resolutions is presently a constraint. The large dataset required for the calibration of crop
simulation models is also another signiﬁcant problem. Future research needs include the development
of cost-effective soil moisture sensors with wider spheres of inﬂuence, identiﬁcation of irrigation
thresholds for plant-based sensors and the development of self-learning crop simulation models that
are able to infer relationships from a limited data set. The ﬁeld evaluation of adaptive decision support
systems would also be beneﬁcial in quantifying their sustainability improvement potential.

AI has become increasingly pervasive across a wide range of industries and sectors, with healthcare, finance, transportation, manufacturing, retail, education, and agriculture are a few examples to mention. As AI technology continues to advance, it is expected to have an even greater impact on industries in the future. For instance, AI is being increasingly used in the agri-food sector to improve productivity, efficiency, and sustainability. It has the potential to revolutionize the agri-food sector in several ways, including but not limited to precision agriculture, crop monitoring, predictive analytics, supply chain optimization, food processing, quality control, personalized nutrition, and food safety. This review emphasizes how recent developments in AI technology have transformed the agri-food sector by improving efficiency, reducing waste, and enhancing food safety and quality, providing particular examples. Furthermore, the challenges, limitations, and future prospects of AI in the field of food and agriculture are summarized. Keywords: machine learning; smart farming; internet of things; sustainable management; food quality; food safety 1. Introduction The world’s population is rapidly growing and is expected to reach around 9.7 billion by 2050 [1]. As a result, there is a growing concern about how to meet the increasing demand for food while also ensuring food security and sustainability. In this regard, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) applications in the agri-food sector has the potential to revolutionize the industry and increase sustainability in several ways. It can help farmers, food manufacturers, and distributors make more informed decisions, improve efficiency, reduce waste, and improve food security and sustainability. The Nobel-prize-winning economist Herbert Simon in 1965 said, “Machines will be capable of doing any work a man can do”. His visionary perspective has come true today through the remarkable achievements that occurred through AI applications [2]. AI refers to the ability of machines or computer programs to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, and decision-making. There are various subfields of AI, including machine learning (ML), deep learning, natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, and cognitive computing. There are several algorithms, for instance, reinforcement learning [3], swarm intelligence, cognitive science, expert system, fuzzy logic (FL), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Logic Programming, that can be used in AI technology [4]. Each of these algorithms has its own unique advantages and limitations, and the choice of algorithm will depend on the specific task or problem at hand. AI is being used in a wide range of applications, such as speech recognition, image and video analysis [5], autonomous vehicles [6], medical diagnosis, financial forecasting, and many others [7]. Similar to any other industry, AI can also be used in the agri-food sector to improve efficiency [8] and develop new, more nutritious crops [9], reduce waste [10], and ensure safety [11]. AI can be used to optimize crop yields [12] and improve distribution and logistics [13]. Table 1 presents summary of the equipment and product’ developed by various AI technologies and their domains. Table 1. Summary of the equipment and product’ developed by various AI technologies and their domains. In precision agriculture, AI can be used to analyze data from sensors, drones, and satellites to optimize farming practices, such as irrigation, fertilization, and pest management. This can lead to higher yields, lower costs, and reduced environmental impact [29,30]. In crop monitoring, AI-powered cameras and sensors can monitor crops in real-time, detecting diseases, pests, and nutrient deficiencies. This allows farmers to take action quickly and prevent crop loss [31,32]. AI algorithms can analyze weather patterns, soil conditions, and historical data to predict crop yields and market demand. This can help farmers plan their planting and harvesting schedules and optimize their pricing strategies [33]. During supply chain optimization, AI can help streamline the supply chain by predicting demand, optimizing logistics, and reducing waste. For example, AI algorithms can be used to predict the optimal time to harvest crops and route trucks, and optimize inventory levels [34,35]. In the food processing industry, AI can be used to optimize food processing operations, such as sorting and grading, and to detect defects or contaminants in food products [30,36]. AI can also be used to identify and sort fruits and vegetables based on their size, color, and other attributes [37]. This can help improve the quality and consistency of food products and reduce waste. AI can be used to monitor food safety by analyzing data from sensors and cameras to detect potential contaminants or other hazards. This can help prevent foodborne illness and improve public health [38,39]. In addition, AI can be used to analyze individual consumer data, such as age, gender, and activity level, to provide personalized nutritional recommendations. This can help consumers make more informed choices about their diet and improve their overall health [40]. While these studies provide some valuable insights into AI applications in the agri-food sector, a detailed review is still needed to understand the current advancements of AI technology in the agri-food sector. Therefore, the objective of this review is to highlight the recent developments in the food and agriculture sector along with the application of AI technology, providing specific examples by the databases during 2010–2023. The review also summarizes the future prospects, challenges, and limitations in the field. 2. Role of AI in the Agriculture The food industry has always been dependent on the agriculture sector since its inception. An increase in food production by the agriculture sector can lead to a larger supply of raw materials for the Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG) industries, which rely on these raw materials for processing and manufacturing products [26]. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected innumerable lives and the supply of these industries pessimistically [41,42]. The government’s decision to declare a state of emergency led to the closure of numerous industries worldwide, which had an effect on the entire supply chain, from the farmer to the consumer [43]. The unexpected decline in output and income, the drop in oil prices, the drop in tourism receipts, the issues with climate change, and other reasons are all connected to the COVID-19 pandemic [44]. According to the FAO, the number of people suffering from hunger and malnutrition has been on the rise in recent years [45]. However, by introducing AI and ML in crop management and using high-tech automated systems, the agriculture industry can tackle many of the problems that affect crop production and improve the quality and quantity of raw materials available to the food industry. Figure 1 depicts the impact of AI on the Argo food sector and FMCG. Some of the ML technologies introduced in the agriculture sector that have contributed to improving crop management are discussed in this section. Figure 1. Impact of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in the Agrofood and FMCG sector. 2.1. Grain Quality Manual grain inspection is a time-consuming process and is prone to human error, which can result in the selection of lower-quality grains. This is because manual inspection relies on human visual acuity and can be affected by factors, such as fatigue, distractions, or variability in lighting conditions. Therefore, the use of computer vision systems in grain inspection is becoming increasingly popular. These systems use advanced imaging techniques and ML algorithms to analyze images of grains and identify defects or impurities, such as broken kernels, foreign materials, or fungal infestations [46]. ANN, dense scale-invariant feature transform (DSIFT) algorithm, and support vector machines (SVM) are ML techniques that have been successfully applied in the agriculture sector for the classification and identification of grains and other agricultural products. ANNs are used to classify different wheat species based on their visual characteristics, such as shape, size, and color [47]. DSIFT algorithm is a computer vision technique that can identify features, such as the size, shape, and texture of the wheat grains, and use them to classify the grains into different categories [48]. SVM is another ML technique that is used for the categorization of wheat grains, identification of fungal species in rice, germinated wheat grains, and analysis of milled rice grains. Some technologies apply computer vision systems for the inspection of grains in the agricultural sector: (i) examination of milled rice grains using SVM, (ii) computerized wheat quality assessment system, and (iii) development of a method using hyperspectral imaging system for the detection of Fusarium infected wheat grains [49,50]. Computer vision systems can help in the accurate and automated monitoring of various plant phenology stages, such as seedling emergence, leaf unfolding, flowering, and fruit ripening. They can also aid in the early detection of plant stress and diseases, allowing for timely interventions and preventing crop losses. In 2015, researchers proposed a computer vision system that uses disease-specific image processing algorithms to identify the presence and severity of leaf spot diseases in rice plants [51]. Backpropagation neural networks (BPNN) have been used in conjunction with other technologies, such as wavelets and fuzzy inference systems, for crop disease detection and classification [52]. In 2017, a study was conducted to investigate the risks of chlorosis due to iron deficiency in soybean plants using real-time phenotyping and ML techniques [53]. This approach allowed for the early detection and monitoring of iron deficiency stress in soybean plants, enabling researchers to optimize iron fertilization strategies and improve crop yields [54,55,56,57]. 2.2. Pest Detection and Weed Management Accurate identification of insect species, size variation, and stage of development is crucial for effective pest management in agriculture. By identifying the type and number of insects present in a crop field, farmers can take appropriate measures to control the pest population and prevent damage to their crops. Several AI and ML technologies are being developed and tested for insect detection and counting. Some of these technologies use computer vision algorithms, while others rely on ML algorithms to identify and classify different insect species [58,59]. However, it is important to note that these technologies are still in their testing stages and have not yet been widely adopted in the agricultural industry. Similarly, herbicides have been widely used by farmers for many years to control weeds and improve crop yields. However, the overuse or improper application of herbicides can have negative impacts on both human health and the environment. To minimize the negative impacts of herbicides, there is a growing need for more precise and accurate application methods [60]. Precision agriculture techniques, such as site-specific application, can help farmers apply herbicides only where they are needed, reducing the amount of chemicals used and minimizing the risk of contamination. The development of AI-based technologies which use ML algorithms and computer vision techniques to detect and classify different types of weeds in crop fields has the potential to improve the efficiency and sustainability of agriculture while also reducing the need for herbicides and improving crop yields [61]. Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and counter propagation-artificial neural networks (CP-ANN) were used for the detection of the weed Silybum marianum [62]. The use of ANN and Multispectral/Hyperspectral imaging technologies can be very effective in detecting and recognizing weed species in crop fields. CP-ANN and multispectral imaging captured by UAS were used to detect the weed Silybum marianum [63]. CP-ANN is a type of artificial neural network that can be used for pattern recognition tasks, while multispectral imaging involves capturing images of crop fields at different wavelengths of light. The combination of these technologies allowed the researchers to identify the presence of the weed with high accuracy and precision. In another research, hyperspectral imaging and ML techniques were used to develop a method for crop and weed species recognition [3]. Hyperspectral imaging involves capturing images of crop fields at many different wavelengths of light, which can provide more detailed information about the spectral properties of different plant species. ML algorithms were then used to analyze these images and classify different plant species, including both crops and weeds. Researchers have also developed SVM based algorithm for the classification of different types of weeds in grassland cropping systems based on images captured by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) [64]. Robotic weed control is also an emerging technology that shows great promise for the future of agriculture. Robotic weed control systems typically use computer vision and ML algorithms to detect and identify weeds in crop fields, then use robotic arms or other mechanical tools to remove or destroy the weeds. These systems can operate in a wide range of crop environments, including greenhouses, where traditional weed control methods, such as herbicides, may not be effective or appropriate [65]. There is the possibility of cultivars being equipped with finger weeders or elastic tines for both inter and intra-row types of weed control [66]. For analyzing site-specific weed control, precision weed management as a part of precision farming is grounded on the utilization of information technology [67]. Although intelligent mechanical weed control would be more felicitous than weeding devices with cutting action, contrary to time-based weed removal [68], it is possible to remotely regulate the tendency of tines of spring-tine harrow prototype systems based on the conditions of soil, the density of weed, and crop production [69]. 2.3. Crop Selection and Yield Improvement Agricultural planning performs an important role in food security around the world, especially in countries with the agro-based sector. The challenge in selection of suitable crops with improved yield is critical as this could be varied depending on numerous conditions, such as weather, soil quality, water access, and pests and diseases [8]. AI and ML technologies are being increasingly used in crop selection and yield improvement in agriculture. These technologies are particularly useful in crop breeding and genetic improvement. By analyzing genetic data from different crop varieties and using ML algorithms to identify key traits associated with yield and other desirable characteristics, plant breeders can develop new crop varieties that are better adapted to specific environmental conditions and produce higher yields. Automation technologies, such as robots, are being increasingly used to improve crop yields by reducing labor costs and improving efficiency in various agricultural tasks, including spraying herbicides, removing weeds, and harvesting fruits and vegetables [4,7,8]. Robots, such as the Berry 5 Robot from Harvest Croo Robotics (Tampa, FL, USA), are designed to automate the harvesting of strawberries, which is a labor-intensive and time-consuming process [12]. The robot uses computer vision and ML algorithms to identify and pick ripe strawberries at a faster rate than humans can. This can help farmers to reduce labor costs and improve their yields by ensuring that more strawberries are harvested at the optimal time. Similarly, robots, such as the “Robocrop”, are being developed for specific agricultural tasks, such as pruning flowers on strawberry plants. Furthermore, the image-processing robot being developed for picking ripened strawberries uses computer vision and ML algorithms to identify and pick the strawberries, reducing labor costs and improving the speed and efficiency of the harvesting process [70]. The National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in London is developing robots that use computer vision and ML to identify water and nutrient levels, control weeds, and perform sorting and packaging [71]. Researchers have developed a method for measuring plant water retention using image processing techniques in combination with software, such as Adobe Photoshop CC 2021 (version 22.0.0.) and MATLAB (version R2022b (9.13)). For the purpose of using X-ray CT to study unsaturated Hostun sand and its water retention behavior, a complete configuration and setup were created. A “step-by-step” technique for obtaining sufficiently high-quality reconstructions that allow the three phases of the material (grain, water, and air) to be differentiated was also provided. The visualization and characterization of the three stages inside the specimen were made easier using picture post-processing. This made it easier to create a measuring map that encompasses the full specimen field [72]. Robotic chassis are developed for robot software where they are assigned their specific tasks. This robot system includes navigation through a field, robotic arms to eliminate unwanted flowers, and image capturing [70]. Similarly, Agboka et al. [73] applied Agroecological breeding methods, such as maize–legume intercropping (MLI) and push-pull technology (PPT), that have been found to be effective in minimizing the losses due to insects. Two simple and explainable models, namely, the hybrid fuzzy logic combined with the genetic algorithm and symbolic regression, are used to forecast maize production. This study also reported that the scale-up of MLI and PPT systems improved productivity in sustainable farming. 2.4. Big Data and IoT in Smart Farming With the use of modern technology called the Internet of Things (IoT), gadgets may link remotely to enable smart farming. To improve efficiency and performance across all sectors, the IoT has started to have an impact on a wide variety of businesses, including those in health, trade, communications, energy, and agriculture [8]. The adoption of modernized technologies in agriculture has led to the emergence of “smart farming”, which is a revolutionary approach that leverages advanced technologies to increase the quality and quantity of agricultural production. AI encourages smart farming, a sustainable technique that helps to avoid resource waste (such as fertilizers and pesticides) and achieve sustainable development, to replace conventional agricultural practices and methodologies [62]. By providing farmers with detailed information on specific crops, such as soil nutritional deficiencies, and moisture levels, and hyper-spectral data to prevent damage, smart farming enables farmers to make more informed decisions about their crops and to optimize their production processes [9]. According to research, the Supply Chain Big Data Analytics Market will climb to $9.28 billion by 2026 [74]. The Agri-IoT framework has the potential to significantly benefit farmers by providing them with real-time data and alerts. By integrating social media trends, farm council alerts, and automatic reasoning, the platform can help farmers to make informed decisions and take action to mitigate the impact of climatic conditions on their crops [75]. Another aspect of smart farming is climate condition-based irrigation. The Specialty Crop Research Initiative-Managing Irrigation and Nutrients with Distributed Sensing (SCRI-MINDS) project is a great initiative aimed at improving plant production. It has been developed to increase efficiency in plant production while controlling the excessive use of irrigation water and nutrients [8]. Microsoft (Redmond, WA, USA) has also developed an AI-based sowing application that provides recommendations, such as the optimal period for sowing seeds, preparing land for cultivation, etc. The model by mobile phone app uses remote sensing data from geo-stationary satellite images to predict crop yields through every stage of farming. To determine the optimal sowing period, the moisture adequacy index was calculated. The input data include historical sowing area, production, yield, and weather. The app sends sowing advisories to participating farmers on the optimal date to sow. The farmers do not need to install any sensors in their fields or incur any capital expenditure; they just need a feature phone capable of receiving text messages [76]. It is thus imperative that smart solutions are being developed for global food safety and security, sustainability of food consumption, and the well-being of society. Likewise, environmentally friendly strategies could reduce the use of resources (water, fertilizers, herbicides, etc.) for agriculture, reduce losses, and shelf-life extension of food products for global food security [77]. Low altitude spectral imaging for identifying pest infestation, nutrient or moisture deficiency, and many more computer-aided systems are being introduced for the protection of natural resources and sustainable agriculture. The use of sensors deployed to monitor farm conditions and low-altitude air-borne hyperspectral imaging is an example of smart farming [78]. Smart farming is one of the biggest methods or systems of precision farming. Precision farming involves the precise number of inputs, such as soil, water, fertilizer, etc., to be distributed in an accurate time and at an accurate place, such as weed control [79]. Trimble Agriculture (Westminster, CO, USA), an industrial technology company, has developed a system called WeedSeeker spot spray which is an innovative solution for efficient and targeted weed control. By using sensors to detect the presence of weeds and a spray nozzle to deliver a precise amount of chemicals, the system can help reduce the use of herbicides and minimize the environmental impact of weed control [65,66]. This system can be mounted even on traditional spraying machines with some modifications and is most effective in areas with intermittent growth of weeds. Precision Agriculture (PA) can be described as a management concept having the ability to recognize variability within the soil environment and maximize agricultural production while minimizing environmental concussion, i.e., temperature and humidity changes, for a particular location. Yield Technology (Carrollton, MO, USA) and Bosch (Stuttgart, Germany) have developed a range of technologies that can be used in precision agriculture to optimize crop yield and reduce resource waste. These technologies include drones, computers, data analytics, and robots, among others [77]. 3. Role of AI in the Food Processing AI and ML technologies are being increasingly adopted in the food processing industry. These technologies are helping to optimize various processes and improve overall efficiency and quality control. The capabilities of the intelligent systems in various tasks, such as intelligent food packaging, product sorting, foreign object detection, new food product development, equipment cleaning, and supply chain management, are elucidated along with the equipment and products developed by various AI technologies. 3.1. Intelligent Food Packaging The proper arrangement and packing of food products are among the challenging tasks and time-consuming processes in the manufacturing sections of the food industry. Food packing has four vital roles—protecting the food, displaying the product, sanitation, and transportation ability [80]. It protects the food from damage caused by biological, chemical, and physiological reasons during the complete food logistic system. The visual appearance of the package helps consumers to judge the quality of the food and is the first impression about the product. Therefore, effective packaging is an essential part of the food manufacturing sector [81]. AI and ML are increasingly being used in the food packaging industry to improve the design, production, and functionality of packaging materials. AI and ML technologies are being used in the food packaging industry to improve packaging design. Liu [82] applied a packaging design model based on deep convolution generative adversarial networks (DCGAN). A packaging design image can be enhanced using visual communication technology, resulting in better visual communication ability, a higher degree of image information fusion, and an improved packaging design effect. However, the development of AI-based systems is a tedious task in the fruits and vegetables sector owing to the inconsistency in shape, color, and size [83]. Thus, a copious quantity of data is required to train the system properly and perform the task in a structured manner. Intelligent tools, such as robotics and drones, can also perform a critical role in reducing the packaging cost significantly [14,84]. For instance, robotics can be used to automate the packaging process, reducing the need for human labor and improving the speed and efficiency of the process. Robots can be used to sort and inspect food products to ensure that they are properly packaged and meet quality standards. Robotics can be used to manage inventory, ensuring that packaging materials are available when needed and reducing the risk of shortages or excess inventory. In addition, drones can be used to deliver food products directly to consumers, reducing the need for packaging and transportation [85]. 3.2. Product Sorting AI-based systems can incorporate a variety of technologies, such as laser technology, X-ray systems, high-resolution cameras, and infrared (IR) spectroscopy, to evaluate the parameters of products at the input level [86]. These technologies can help identify defects, contaminants, and inconsistencies in the products, enabling intelligent decision-making and improving the overall quality of the products. However, the inconsistent product homogeneity can be a major drawback for sorting methods that rely on input-level evaluation. Inhomogeneous products may result in inaccurate sorting decisions, leading to increased waste or lower product quality [15]. To overcome this challenge, some sorting systems use multiple sensors or technologies to assess product quality and identify defects from multiple perspectives. Additionally, ML algorithms can be trained to recognize patterns and variations in product properties, helping to improve accuracy and consistency in sorting decisions. TOMRA (Asker Municipality, Norway), the global provider of advanced collection and sorting systems, has developed an AI system that can efficiently perform the sorting task with 90% efficiency. Industries, by utilizing such systems, have gained some advantages, such as increased production, high-quality yielding, and reduced labor cost. It has been reported that the segregation and arrangement issues can be enhanced by 5–10% in the case of potatoes [14]. In the apple processing industry, deep learning, a subdivision of ML, and a sub-field of AI help to categorize the apples with the help of datasets through pattern recognition and decision-making. Similarly, Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) assists in identifying the type of apple with the support of CVS (Concurrent Versions System). The deep learning model was processed by the data from image processing, apple detection, and ripeness classification. The classifiers are able to achieve the best result, i.e., the ripeness class of an apple from a given digital image [15]. In addition, coffee beans are classified based on the standards, category, defects, and nature of the beverage produced. The types of Arabic espresso are numbered from the grouping by type or imperfection, from two to eight [87]. 3.3. Foreign Object Detection Contamination by foreign objects causes major issues, including food recalls, rejection by consumers, harm to customers, and leads to a fall in brand reliability. Foreign matter, including insects, glass, metal, or rubber, may accidentally enter the food or packing material during food processing, handling, or preparation. Although the magnitude of risks associated with foreign matter depends on the size, type, clarity, and hardness of the object, the consumption of food contaminated with such objects could lead to choking or other complications [88]. As identification of such contaminants with the unaided eye is tough, AI and ML technologies can perform an important role in their detection by analyzing images of the food products to identify any foreign objects that may be present [47]. One approach to foreign object detection using AI and ML is to use image recognition algorithms that are trained on large datasets of images of contaminated and uncontaminated food products. The algorithm can then analyze images of the food products in real-time and identify any foreign objects that may be present [89]. Shimonomura et al. [90] applied a cylindrical tactile image sensor for detecting foreign objects in food based on differences in hardness. Small, hard foreign bodies that were sub-millimeter in size and mixed in with soft food could be successfully detected by using a reflective membrane-type sensor surface with high sensitivity. Through investigations to find shell pieces left on the surface of raw shrimp and bones left in fish fillets, the effectiveness of the suggested method was confirmed. 3.4. New Food Product Development As new product development in the food industry completely relies on the consumer’s perspectives, the data collected by the various decision-making systems are useful in the launch of new products. By analyzing the data gathered by the system, the ML-based module could answer the question “what exactly the consumers are looking for” and make proper decisions. One of the multinational companies has installed automatic vending machines throughout the USA for delivering soft drinks, and consumers have thousands of options to select their favorite flavors. The information stored by the machine could be analyzed by the ML module and deep learning algorithms for the development of a new product; one such example is Cherry Sprite, launched by the company. It has also been proposed that, in the upcoming decades, many of the food industries will benefit from the ML-based decision-making system for the launch of new food products [91]. A biotechnology company has launched the world’s first bioactive peptide through AI technology. A sports nutrition ingredient is a unique peptide network derived from rice protein for alleviating inflammation via modulating cytokine responses and for improving immune activity. The company has become the world’s first company to demonstrate the potential of AI in improving human health [92]. Another US-based IoT-focused technology company has introduced AI-powdered ‘home cooking sidekick’, a web and mobile application that integrates with smart kitchen assistant Hello Egg to fully automate kitchen needs. The home assistant is powered through voice technology to recommend a diet plan based on the preferences of an individual. This can also manage the pantry, categorize shopping cart, exhibits video recipes, and assists in the delivery of groceries [93]. The role of sensory panelists employed in food and beverage industries aim to sensory evaluate the new products based on the flavor preferences of consumers. Unfortunately, it is difficult to predict the perception and preferences of the target group. This led industries to develop a robust methodology for measuring and predicting consumer preferences through an AI-based Gastrograph system which uses ML and predictive algorithms to understand market preference [94]. 3.5. Equipment Cleaning and Maintenance Pieces of machinery and processing tools used in food processing industries must be cleaned regularly for proper maintenance. AI-based systems, such as Cleaning in place (CIP) and Clean-out-of-place (COP) systems, assist the food industry to ensure hygiene and maintain product quality at high standards. For its implementation, various cameras and sensors are installed to carry out the tasks. Currently, a European company specializing in providing cleaning solutions has introduced SOCIP, a Self-Optimizing-Clean-In-Place system to autonomously optimize the cleaning process for food manufacturing equipment using AI technology. SOCIP employs ultrasonic sensing imaging methods and optical fluorescence methods to assess the number of food particles and microbial debris that is present inside the equipment. The SOCIP system works by using sensors to scan the inside of the equipment and create a real-time image of the surface. This information is then used to determine how much cleaning is necessary to achieve the desired level of cleanliness [36,74]. 3.6. Demand-Supply Chain Management Presently, food industries are concerned about food safety policies, which are necessary for the transparent execution of all food logistic activities [2,62]. To monitor every stage of the process, for instance, from cost regulation to resource management, AI is being employed. It manages and predicts the passage of possessions from where they are grown to the place where consumers gather them [95]. One company provides integrated AI-enabled solutions for the retail industry. Their solutions can help to optimize various aspects of retail operations, including transportation, billing, resource management, and inventory control. The system can improve the retail industry using AI algorithms to optimize packaging and improve shelf life [96]. By analyzing data on product characteristics, environmental conditions, and other factors, AI algorithms can help to identify the optimal packaging materials and designs to improve product quality and extend shelf life. Additionally, AI can help to improve food safety by providing greater transparency and visibility into the logistics and supply chain process. By tracking products from farm to table, retailers can identify and address potential food safety issues before they become a problem. There will be a need for more contributions that make use of a variety of data sources in order to realize the goal of an expanded agri-food supply chain that involves more stakeholders and the whole supply chain lifetime. Additionally, to complete the loop in sustainable agri-food, the extended AI support for agri-food needs to increase the use of contextual information, food consumption, and food waste reduction [97]. 3.7. 3D/4D Food Printing-Extrusion Technology AI can be of particular interest when combined with 3D and 4D printing technologies. By integrating AI into 3D/4D printing process, it is possible to increase the performance of the printers, reduce the risk of errors, and facilitate automated production. The combination of AI and 3D/4D printing technologies can lead to the establishment of start-ups and research projects that integrate AI into 3D/4D printing products and services [98,99]. The food processing sectors worldwide are now adopting 3D food printing technology to engender operations more systematically and independently. This technology can cause active food value chains more client-friendly and viable by delivering on-demand food manufacturing, empowering computerized food customization, and reducing food wastage. A 3D/4D food printer operates in a similar way to a regular 3D printer, with the primary difference being the printing medium used. Instead of using melted plastic, a 3D/4D food printer uses a food material as the printing medium. Consumers can materialize designs from an e-commerce platform via websites or mobile applications, and this would minimize warehousing, packaging, and delivery charges [100]. The effectiveness of printing food is improved while food processing expenses and time are minimized, and time is saved by refining 3D printing techniques and equipment [101]. An additional aspect is that personalized products will be delivered very quickly using 3D printing technology than regular food processing technology. As the products are delivered much faster, the need for synthetic polymer-based packing materials and chemical preservatives could be eliminated, and this will also improve food safety. Furthermore, multiphase processing of food products could be minimized to a single stage [102]. 4. Role of AI in Food Quality and Food Safety AI’s captivating capability has made it an extremely appealing technology to use in industries not only for decision-making, process estimation, cost savings, and high profitability but also for overall quality improvement [103]. AI, combined with data science, has the potential to improve the quality of food and service offered by cafes, restaurants, online food delivery systems, and food stores, leading to increased sales, profitability, and customer satisfaction. By analyzing data and applying algorithms, AI can help to improve sales prediction, menu optimization, personalized recommendations, and supply chain optimization [16]. AI has made significant contributions to various aspects of the food industry, and these contributions can be broadly classified into three main categories, food quality management, food security management, and food waste management [74]. AI has significant roles and potential applications in several food sectors, including dairy, beverage, and bakery, and are presented in Figure 2. Figure 2. The layout of the functions of AI in several food sectors. AI can be used to analyze large amounts of data from dairy production processes to identify patterns and make predictions that can optimize production and improve product quality. By using AI tools, such as fuzzy logic and ANN, dairy producers can make more accurate predictions and adjust their processes accordingly, leading to more efficient and higher-quality production. Similarly, AI tools, such as e-nose, e-tongue, CVS, and image analysis, can help producers optimize their production processes and understand consumer preferences in the beverage industry. AI can also help the bakery industry to improve product quality, increase productivity, and by using AI-powered tools, such as robots and visualization, bakeries can create more innovative products and optimize their production processes [85]. 4.1. Food Quality Management Fresh fruits and vegetables are highly perishable and can quickly spoil if not stored and monitored properly. In the past, many vendors did not have access to the necessary tools to monitor the real-time condition of fruits in storage, which resulted in significant food waste. However, with the advancements in technology, there are now several solutions available that can help vendors to monitor the condition of fresh fruits and vegetables in real-time [104]. Digital twin (DT) technology is a promising tool for monitoring the quality and condition of fresh fruits and vegetables throughout the cold chain. The extent of tissue damage that occurs in fruits depends on several factors, including physical and biochemical properties, and environmental factors, such as temperature, humidity, and postharvest treatments. By using DT technology to monitor these factors, it is possible to identify potential issues early on and take corrective action to prevent further damage [17]. In addition to monitoring the cold chain, DT technology can also be used to optimize the storage and transportation of fresh fruits and vegetables [17,105]. Thermal imaging is a non-contact and emerging technology that is becoming increasingly popular for fruit quality examination in the fruit and food industry. It offers a non-destructive way to examine a product without the need for extraction, which could cause permanent damage. Infrared thermal imaging detects the presence of damage or defects in fresh fruits and vegetables by measuring the change in temperature between undamaged and damaged tissues, which is caused by the variation in thermal diffusion coefficients [105]. Likewise, CVS technologies are increasingly being used in the food industry to examine the quality of different kinds of food products. By using different types of CVS, including traditional CVS, hyperspectral CVS, and multispectral CVS to examine the exterior quality of food products, it is possible to identify potential issues early on and take corrective action to prevent further deterioration or contamination [106]. Electric noses (Ens) and electric tongues (Ets) are among the most promising inventions of AI in the food industry [107]. EN is an instrument that consists of an array of electronic chemical sensors with an appropriate pattern recognition system and partial specificity, capable of recognizing complex or simple odors and Ets are multisensory systems for liquid analysis based on chemical sensor arrays and pattern recognition [108]. The sensors used in Ens are able to collect data on the different smells and flavors present in the food or beverage being analyzed. This data is then transferred to a data center, where it can be accessed by ML algorithms [109]. These algorithms are able to analyze the data and make decisions based on the information gathered. In addition, EN technology can also be used to improve the overall quality of food products. By detecting subtle differences in the smells and flavors of different batches of food products, companies can make adjustments to their production processes to ensure that their products are consistent and of the highest quality [110]. The coffee cupping method was developed by the Specialty Coffee Association of America (SCAA). It is a well-established process for assessing the quality of roasted coffee, and it involves steeping ground coffee beans in boiling water and evaluating the aroma, flavor, and other sensory characteristics of the resulting brew. In recent years, AI technologies, such as Ens and ANNs, have been used to enhance the coffee cupping process. E-noses can be used to detect and analyze the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are responsible for the aroma of coffee. By using an EN in combination with an ANN, it is possible to predict the quality and flavor of roasted coffee with a high degree of accuracy [111]. Ets are another promising technology in the food industry that can be used to assess the qualities of various types of beverages, including dairy and alcoholic beverages. Ets can detect different taste characteristics, such as sweetness, saltiness, sourness, and bitterness, which can be important factors in determining the overall quality of a product. For example, in the case of tea, there are certain flavor compounds, such as theaflavin (TF) and thearubigin (TR), which can vary in concentration depending on the age of the tea. By using a pulse voltametric ET in combination with a UV-VIS spectrophotometer-based analysis, these compounds can be measured and used to identify the type of tea being analyzed [112,113]. One of the key advantages of the e-tongue is its ability to detect dissolved solids and volatile compounds that are responsible for the aroma and can give off odors after evaporation. This makes it a useful tool for analyzing the overall flavor profile of a sample, and its aroma [114]. The use of Ets for food recognition has been studied extensively, including for the differentiation of liquid and flesh foods. In a study by Rudnitskaya et al. [113], an ET was used to analyze a range of liquid and flesh food samples, including juices, wines, and meat products. The results of the study showed that the ET was able to successfully differentiate between different types of liquid and flesh foods based on their taste profiles. The study conducted by Tan and Xu [114] reviewed the applications of electronic noses (e-noses) and electronic tongues (e-tongues) in the determination of food quality-related properties. The study found that e-noses and e-tongues are increasingly being used in the food industry due to their ability to detect and identify various volatile and non-volatile compounds that contribute to food aroma and taste. 4.2. Food Safety Management Food safety ensures the absence of any harmful/toxic substances in it and fulfills the obligatory nutritional requirements. A multidisciplinary approach is necessary to ensure food safety and good hygiene during food processing, storage, and sale, and to eliminate the risk of biotic and abiotic contaminants, which causes food poisoning. Image processing techniques can be used to analyze various characteristics of food products, including size, shape, color, and texture. By estimating the projected area and perimeter of food items, one can quantify their size and shape, which can be useful for quality control purposes [115]. However, it is worth noting that image processing techniques alone cannot detect the presence of harmful microorganisms or other potential food safety hazards. That is where next-generation sequencing (NGS) comes into perform by the determination of the whole genome sequence of a single cultured isolate (e.g., a bacterial colony, a virus, or any other organism), also known as “whole genome sequencing” (WGS), and “metagenomics”, in which NGS is used to generate sequences of several microorganisms in a biological sample [11]. Furthermore, the use of AI and automation can greatly speed up the analysis of NGS data, allowing for more rapid identification of potential food safety hazards. This can help prevent widespread illness by allowing for quick intervention before contaminated products reach consumers [116]. 4.3. Food Waste Management Food waste is a significant issue that affects not only the environment but also food security and financial sustainability. It is estimated that 1.6 billion tons of food are wasted annually, and most of this waste (81%) is made up of inedible by-products of food production practices. There is a growing recognition within the food industry that food waste is not just an unavoidable cost of doing business but also a significant sustainability issue and an underutilized resource [85]. According to McKinsey & Company (New York, NY, USA), a consulting firm that has been at the forefront of researching and implementing AI in various industries, AI could offer a $127 billion opportunity by reducing food waste by 2030 [74]. Modern techniques, such as omics, can be exploited to overcome food waste reduction and management challenges. For example, metagenomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, waste omics, and disease omics can be used to understand the biochemical processes that occur during food waste decomposition and identify potential hazards and contaminants in food waste [10]. There have been various conglomerate concepts and solutions developed and tested by researchers and government organizations to mitigate and manage food waste issues. For instance, Black Soldier Fly (BSF) farming is a promising practice for its versatility and multi-roles in various applications, such as sustainable food production and food waste management. The implementation of Internet of Things (IoT) technology in BSF farming can offer significant benefits in terms of efficient production and waste management. By integrating sensors and devices with software and mobile applications, farmers can remotely monitor and control various parameters of BSF farming. This allows for more precise and customized control over the growing conditions of the BSF larvae, leading to higher yields and better-quality biomass [117,118]. 4.4. Predicting Shelf Life AI and ML techniques, including ANNs, have been widely applied to predict the shelf life of foods. These techniques use mathematical models and data from various physicochemical and sensory parameters of the food product to develop predictive models that can estimate the expected shelf life [18,119]. A research study conducted by Goyal and Goyal [120] proposed the use of time-delayed neural network (TDNN) models for predicting the shelf life of processed cheese. The study aimed to develop a model that could accurately predict the shelf life of processed cheese and reduce the need for time-consuming physical testing. The results of the study showed that the TDNN model was able to accurately predict the shelf life of processed cheese. AI models for shelf-life prediction of mangoes stored under different conditions were developed based on respiration rate and ripeness levels under different supply chain scenarios. A deep-CNN was fine-tuned on 1524 image data of mangoes that can classify the ripeness levels of mangoes [121]. 5. Role of AI in the Personalized Nutrition Nutrition can be a complex and individualized aspect of life, and what works for one person may not work for another. Personalized nutrition is an approach that considers an individual’s unique nutritional needs, preferences, and health goals. Advancements in technology, such as AI and ML, are enabling the development of personalized nutrition solutions. These solutions use data about an individual’s genetics, microbiome, lifestyle, and dietary habits to provide personalized nutrition recommendations [122]. One example of a personalized nutrition solution is a digital health company that offers personalized nutrition solutions for individuals and healthcare organizations, which uses ML to analyze an individual’s dietary habits and provide personalized food recommendations. Another example is a biotechnology company that offers personalized nutrition solutions based on an individual’s microbiome. The company uses AI and ML to analyze an individual’s gut microbiome and provide personalized dietary recommendations based on the types and amounts of gut bacteria present [123]. Similarly, another digital health company offers a range of personalized health coaching solutions, including personalized nutrition coaching, weight management, diabetes management, and hypertension management. This company uses speech recognition and voice AI technologies to provide personalized health coaching to individuals. The company’s mobile app uses speech recognition technology to analyze an individual’s voice and provide personalized coaching based on their responses. One is a mobile app and website that allows individuals to track their daily food intake and monitor their nutrition goals. The app provides users with access to a database of over 800,000 food items, allowing them to easily log their meals and track their calories, macronutrients, and micronutrients. Im2Calories uses a combination of computer vision algorithms and deep learning to analyze the visual features of food images and estimate the number of calories in the food [124]. 6. Conclusions and Future Perspectives AI has the potential to revolutionize the food and agriculture sector by improving efficiency, increasing productivity, and promoting sustainability. However, the future of AI in the food and agriculture sector also raises some concerns. For example, there are concerns about the potential for AI to increase inequality and reduce jobs in rural areas. A major constraint is the high cost of implementing AI systems. AI requires significant investment in hardware, software, and training, which can be prohibitively expensive for small and medium-sized businesses. Additionally, there are concerns about the reliability and accuracy of AI systems, particularly when it comes to making decisions about crop management and food safety. Smart, robotic farming and factories are just some of the ways in which AI and ML are being used to improve efficiency, productivity, and sustainability in the Agri-food industry. The future of the agriculture and food industry is likely to be shaped by AI and ML technologies with a range of potential applications across farming, pest management, food processing, packaging, quality control, shelf-life extension, and supply chain management. While there is a lot of potential for AI to revolutionize the agri-food sector, making it more efficient, sustainable, and innovative, it also raises important ethical, legal, and social implications that need to be carefully considered and addressed. It is important to ensure that these technologies are developed and used in a sustainable and ethical manner to ensure their long-term benefits. The sustainability of AI will depend on a range of factors, including the development and deployment of AI technologies, the policies and regulations that govern their use, and the way in which society adapts to the changes that AI brings. The sustainability of AI encompasses a range of environmental, social, and economic factors. There are several key considerations that need to be considered when it comes to the sustainability and future of AI. There is a need to address the skills gap and to ensure that there is a sufficient pool of talent to develop and deploy AI systems in a sustainable and responsible manner. This requires investment in education and training programs that can equip individuals with the skills and knowledge needed to work in the field of AI. While there are still challenges to be overcome, such as data privacy concerns, high cost, ethical issues, and the need for specialized training, the future looks promising for AI in this industry. As more and more farmers adopt AI-powered technologies, one can expect to see significant improvements in food production and distribution in the years to come. Future works could include a comparison of different ML algorithms in terms of predictive performance on operational processes in the agri-food sector. Author Contributions A.T., G.N., M.J., S.S.

A systematic review of automated systems for real-time irrigation management

1. INTRODUCTION
The challenge of feeding a growing population with finite resources is becoming increasingly pressing. By 2050, the world population is expected to reach 9.7 billion, necessitating a 70% increase in food production (Falkenmark and Rockstrom, 2009). Irrigation plays a crucial role in enhancing crop yields and agricultural productivity to meet this growing demand. Studies have shown that irrigation can significantly increase crop water productivity, contributing to increased food production (Ali and Talukder, 2008; Playan and Mateos, 2005). However, water scarcity poses a significant challenge, with many regions facing water deficits and the need for improved water management practices (Falkenmark and Rockstrom, 2009). Optimizing irrigation schedules and doses based on crop requirements and environmental conditions is essential for maximizing yield and quality while minimizing water use (Zhang et al., 2024). The necessity of scalable water-efficient practices for increasing food demand cannot be overstated. Techniques such as regulated deficit irrigation, magnetically treated water, and the use of drought-tolerant crops like sorghum have shown promise in improving water productivity and ensuring food security (Mehmood et al., 2023; Putti et al., 2023; Hadebe et al., 2016). As the global food challenge intensifies, it is imperative to critically evaluate the current state and future potential of irrigation management systems to guide research, innovation, and implementation efforts towards fully autonomous, scalable solutions.

Despite the importance of irrigation in addressing the global food challenge, traditional irrigation management techniques, such as manual scheduling and timer-based systems, have significant limitations. These methods are often labor-intensive, inefficient, and less adaptable to changing conditions (Savin et al., 2023). Manual and timer-based scheduling can lead to high operational costs and inefficient water use (Raghavendra, Han, and Shin, 2023). The reliance on manual intervention and predetermined schedules limits their adaptability to changing environmental conditions, crop water requirements, and soil moisture levels (Kaptein et al., 2019). Sensor-based irrigation systems offer an alternative, enabling real-time adjustments based on soil water status measurements (Kaptein et al., 2019). However, the adoption of these systems in commercial settings has been limited, often requiring extensive input from researchers (Kim et al., 2014; Lea-Cox et al., 2018; Ristvey et al., 2018). The limitations of traditional irrigation management techniques highlight the need for scalable, automated solutions for greater efficiency in irrigation management. Automated systems that collect real-time data, analyze it, and make autonomous irrigation decisions can lead to improved water use efficiency and increased crop productivity (Champness et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2022). To fully understand the potential of automated systems, it is necessary to examine the automation of each part of the irrigation management pipeline and analyze the effectiveness and efficiency of integrated end-to-end solutions.

The emergence of smart irrigation management and IoT marks a significant shift from historical irrigation practices. Modern approaches rely on vast data and analysis algorithms, leveraging technologies such as remote sensing, sensor networks, weather data, and computational algorithms (Atanasov, 2023; Bellvert et al., 2023; Kumar et al., 2023). IoT plays a vital role in collecting vast amounts of data through sensors, data transmission, and tailored networks, enabling real-time monitoring and control of irrigation systems (Liakos, 2023; Zuckerman et al., 2024). These advancements in data collection and analysis have the potential to revolutionize irrigation management, allowing for more precise and efficient water use. However, challenges such as processing diverse data sources, data integration, and lack of integrated data analysis hamper the full benefit of IoT in irrigation management (Dave et al., 2023). The current fragmented approach in smart irrigation, focusing on individual components rather than the entire system, limits the potential for fully autonomous, real-time end-to-end irrigation management (Togneri et al., 2021). To address these challenges and fully realize the potential of smart irrigation management, there is a need for automating and integrating each section of the irrigation management pipeline, from sensor/weather data collection and transmission to processing, analysis, decision-making, and automated action (McKinion and Lemmon, 1985). This integration requires a thorough investigation of the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling seamless communication and compatibility between components within the automated irrigation management pipeline.

Machine learning (ML) plays a significant role in processing vast data, predicting plant stress, modeling climate effects, and optimizing irrigation in smart irrigation management systems. ML algorithms can analyze data collected from sensors and weather stations to determine optimal irrigation schedules (Vianny et al., 2022). However, the potential of ML is often constrained by manual steps, such as data interpretation, decision-making on irrigation timing and volume, and system adjustments. Automating ML integration to allow direct action from insights to irrigation execution, removing bottlenecks and achieving real-time adaptability, is crucial for fully autonomous irrigation management (Barzallo-Bertot et al., 2022). By integrating ML into automated systems, the irrigation management pipeline can become more seamless and efficient, enabling real-time decision-making and action based on data-driven insights. To achieve this level of automation and integration, it is essential to identify gaps and propose solutions for seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, aiming to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.

To achieve seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, interoperability and standardization are critical. Interoperability allows different system components, such as sensors, actuators, and software, to communicate and exchange data effectively, while standardization ensures that data is represented in a consistent format (Santos et al., 2020). Standardized protocols and data formats are essential for achieving seamless integration and ensuring compatibility between components in real-time irrigation management systems (Robles et al., 2022; Hatzivasilis et al., 2018). Existing and emerging standards, such as OGC SensorThings API and ISO 11783, have applicability to real-time irrigation management systems (Hazra et al., 2021). However, challenges such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security need to be addressed to fully realize the potential of interoperability and standardization in automated irrigation management systems (Hazra et al., 2021). Addressing these challenges is crucial for enabling the seamless integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline, which is essential for achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. A comprehensive evaluation of the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling the integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline is necessary to guide future research and implementation efforts.
The primary objective of this systematic review is to critically evaluate the current state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies for enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
Specific objectives include:
•	Examining the automation of each part of the irrigation management pipeline and the seamless integration of each section in the context of irrigation scheduling and management.

By addressing these objectives, this systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive and critical evaluation of the current state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems. Its intention is to guide future research, innovation, and implementation efforts to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management that can contribute to addressing the global food challenge.

3. DATA COLLECTION TO CLOUD: AUTOMATION AND REAL-TIME PROCESSING
3.1. Irrigation management data
The success of automated irrigation management systems relies heavily on the collection, transmission, and analysis of various types of data. The most applicable data types for irrigation management include soil moisture, canopy temperature, weather data, and plant physiological parameters (Farooq et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Olivier et al., 2021; Evett et al., 2020). These data are typically collected from a range of sources, including in-field sensors, remote sensing platforms, weather stations, and manual measurements (Li et al., 2019; Karimi et al., 2018).
Soil moisture data is arguably the most critical type of data for irrigation management, as it directly reflects the water available to plants and can be used to determine the optimal timing and amount of irrigation (Olivier et al., 2021; Intrigliolo & Castel, 2006). Soil moisture sensors, such as tensiometers, capacitance probes, and time-domain reflectometry (TDR) sensors, can provide real-time measurements of soil water content at various depths (Farooq et al., 2019). These sensors can be deployed in a network configuration to capture spatial variability in soil moisture across a field (Karimi et al., 2018).
Canopy temperature data is another valuable type of data for irrigation management, as it can be used to assess plant water stress and adjust irrigation accordingly (Evett et al., 2020). Infrared thermometers and thermal cameras can be used to measure canopy temperature, which is influenced by factors such as air temperature, humidity, wind speed, and plant water status (Li et al., 2019). When plants experience water stress, they tend to close their stomata to reduce water loss, leading to an increase in canopy temperature (Evett et al., 2020). By monitoring canopy temperature and comparing it to reference values, automated irrigation systems can detect plant water stress and trigger irrigation events to maintain optimal plant health and productivity (Li et al., 2019).
Weather data, including temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, and solar radiation, are essential for predicting crop water requirements and scheduling irrigation events (Akilan & Baalamurugan, 2024). Weather stations equipped with various sensors can provide real-time measurements of these parameters, which can be used as inputs for crop water requirement models, such as the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith equation (Li et al., 2019). These models estimate crop evapotranspiration (ET) based on weather data and crop-specific coefficients, allowing for the calculation of irrigation requirements (Intrigliolo & Castel, 2006). By integrating weather data into automated irrigation systems, irrigation schedules can be dynamically adjusted based on changing environmental conditions, ensuring that crops receive the optimal amount of water at the right time (Akilan & Baalamurugan, 2024).
When collecting and utilizing these data types, several considerations must be taken into account, including the volume, frequency, format, and source of the data (Farooq et al., 2019). The volume of data generated by automated irrigation systems can be substantial, especially when high-resolution sensors are deployed at a large scale (Bastidas Pacheco et al., 2022). This necessitates the use of efficient data storage, processing, and transmission technologies to handle the data load (Farooq et al., 2019). The frequency of data collection is another important consideration, as it directly impacts the temporal resolution of the data and the ability to detect rapid changes in plant water status or environmental conditions (Bastidas Pacheco et al., 2022). Bastidas Pacheco et al. (2022) demonstrated that collecting full pulse resolution data from water meters provides more accurate estimates of event occurrence, timing, and features compared to aggregated temporal resolutions, highlighting the importance of selecting appropriate data collection frequencies to ensure the quality and usefulness of the data for irrigation management.
The format of the data is also crucial, as it determines the compatibility and interoperability of the data with various analysis tools and platforms (Farooq et al., 2019). Standardized data formats, such as JSON, XML, or CSV, can facilitate data exchange and integration between different components of the automated irrigation system (Zhang et al., 2023). The source of the data is another important consideration, as it can impact the reliability, accuracy, and spatial coverage of the data (Farooq et al., 2019). For example, in-field sensors provide highly localized measurements, while remote sensing platforms, such as satellites or drones, can provide data at larger spatial scales (Li et al., 2019). By combining data from multiple sources, automated irrigation systems can achieve a more comprehensive understanding of crop water requirements and optimize irrigation management accordingly (Farooq et al., 2019).
Data quality, accuracy, and reliability are paramount in irrigation management, as they directly impact the effectiveness of decision-making processes and the efficiency of water use (Gupta et al., 2020). Inaccurate or unreliable data can lead to suboptimal irrigation decisions, resulting in crop stress, yield losses, or wasted water resources (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022). Gupta et al. (2020) emphasized the critical importance of data security and privacy in smart farming systems, as the leakage of sensitive agricultural data can cause severe economic losses to farmers and compromise the integrity of the automated irrigation system. The authors also highlighted the need for robust authentication and secure communication protocols to prevent unauthorized access to smart farming systems and protect data in transit (Gupta et al., 2020).
Ramli and Jabbar (2022) addressed the challenges associated with implementing real-time, automated irrigation systems, including data quality, scalability, reliability, and security. They proposed solutions and best practices based on the analysis of case studies and real-world implementations, such as the use of redundant sensors, data validation techniques, and secure communication protocols (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022). The authors also emphasized the importance of regular maintenance and calibration of sensors to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the collected data (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022).
Researchers have investigated the use of data compression, aggregation, and filtering techniques to reduce bandwidth requirements and improve transmission efficiency in automated irrigation systems (Karim et al., 2023; Rady et al., 2020; Cui, 2023). Karim et al. (2023) explored the effectiveness of various data compression techniques, such as lossless and lossy compression algorithms, in reducing the size of data packets transmitted over wireless networks. The authors found that lossless compression techniques, such as Huffman coding and Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW), can significantly reduce data size without compromising data quality, while lossy compression techniques, such as JPEG and MP3, can further reduce data size by introducing acceptable levels of distortion (Karim et al., 2023).
Rady et al. (2020) developed a novel data compression algorithm specifically designed for irrigation data, which achieved significant compression ratios without compromising data quality. The authors demonstrated that their algorithm could reduce the amount of data transmitted over wireless networks, thereby improving the efficiency of the irrigation system and reducing costs (Rady et al., 2020). Cui (2023) investigated the use of data aggregation and filtering techniques to reduce the number of transmissions and save bandwidth in automated irrigation systems. The author proposed a data aggregation scheme that combines multiple sensor readings into a single value, such as the average soil moisture over a specified time interval, to reduce the frequency of data transmissions (Cui, 2023). Additionally, the author explored the use of data filtering techniques, such as Kalman filters and particle filters, to remove noise and outliers from sensor data, improving the accuracy and reliability of the transmitted information (Cui, 2023).
Data standardization and harmonization are crucial for facilitating seamless integration and interoperability between the various components of automated irrigation management systems (Zhang et al., 2023; Ermoliev et al., 2022). Zhang et al. (2023) developed a novel cyberinformatics technology called iCrop, which enables the in-season monitoring of crop-specific land cover across the contiguous United States. The authors highlighted the importance of data standardization and harmonization in the context of iCrop, as it allows for the efficient distribution of crop-specific land cover information based on the findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data principle (Zhang et al., 2023). By adopting standardized data formats and protocols, such as the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards, iCrop enables the seamless integration of various data sources and facilitates the interoperability of the system with other agricultural decision support tools (Zhang et al., 2023).
Ermoliev et al. (2022) proposed a linkage methodology for linking distributed sectoral/regional optimization models in a situation where private information is not available or cannot be shared by modeling teams. The authors emphasized the need for data standardization to enable decentralized cross-sectoral coordination and analysis, as it allows for the consistent representation and exchange of data between different models and stakeholders (Ermoliev et al., 2022). By adopting standardized data formats and interfaces, the proposed linkage methodology can facilitate the integration of various optimization models and support the development of comprehensive decision support systems for sustainable resource management (Ermoliev et al., 2022).
Metadata plays a vital role in providing context and enabling better data interpretation and decision-making in automated irrigation management systems (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021). Metadata refers to the additional information that describes the characteristics, quality, and context of the primary data, such as the sensor type, calibration parameters, measurement units, and timestamp (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021). Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al. (2021) highlighted the importance of metadata in water resources management, as it enables decision-makers to use the data to the best of its capabilities by understanding factors such as when water data was collected and what factors might have contributed to the measurements. The authors emphasized the need for standardized metadata formats and guidelines, such as the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) and the ISO 19115 standard, to ensure the consistency and interoperability of metadata across different water information systems (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021).
In the context of automated irrigation management systems, metadata can provide valuable information about the data collection process, sensor performance, and environmental conditions that can aid in data interpretation and decision-making (Cota & Mamede, 2023). For example, metadata about the sensor type and calibration parameters can help assess the accuracy and reliability of the collected data, while metadata about the weather conditions and soil properties can provide context for interpreting the data and adjusting irrigation strategies accordingly (Cota & Mamede, 2023). By incorporating metadata into the data management and analysis pipeline of automated irrigation systems, decision-makers can make more informed and context-aware decisions, leading to improved water use efficiency and crop productivity (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021).

3.2. Edge Computing and Fog Computing
Edge computing and fog computing have emerged as transformative technologies in the realm of real-time irrigation management systems, offering significant potential for improving efficiency, scalability, and reliability (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2019). Edge computing refers to the practice of processing data near the edge of the network, close to the source of the data, while fog computing is a decentralized computing infrastructure that extends cloud computing capabilities to the network edge (Hassija et al., 2019). These technologies bring computation and analytics closer to the data source, reducing the need for data to travel to the cloud and enabling faster processing and decision-making (Hassija et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020).
The potential of edge computing and fog computing in real-time irrigation management is immense. Abdel Nasser et al. (2020) proposed a two-layer system for water demand prediction using automated meters and machine learning techniques, demonstrating the potential of edge computing in improving the efficiency and scalability of irrigation management. The system collects and aggregates data from distributed smart meters in the first layer, while the second layer uses LSTM neural networks to predict water demand for different regions of households. By leveraging edge computing, the system can achieve high accuracy in predicting water demand, which is essential for efficient irrigation management (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020).
Tran et al. (2019) conducted a comprehensive review of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems, highlighting the role of fog computing in addressing data transmission challenges and enabling seamless integration across the irrigation management pipeline. The authors emphasize that real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems have the potential to significantly improve water efficiency, crop yields, and reduce labor costs. However, they also identify several challenges that need to be addressed, such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security, which can be effectively tackled by implementing fog computing architectures (Tran et al., 2019).
Edge computing offers several benefits in real-time irrigation management systems, including reduced latency, real-time decision-making, and reduced reliance on cloud connectivity (Mishra, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). By processing data closer to the source, edge computing enables faster response times and more efficient data handling (Mishra, 2020). Mishra (2020) highlights that edge computing reduces latency by processing data closer to the source, enabling real-time decision-making and lessening reliance on cloud connectivity by shifting processing to local or edge devices.
Zhang et al. (2020) explore the application of edge computing in agricultural settings, demonstrating its potential to improve the efficiency and accuracy of irrigation systems. The authors discuss how edge computing has prospects in various agricultural applications, such as pest identification, safety traceability of agricultural products, unmanned agricultural machinery, agricultural technology promotion, and intelligent management. They also emphasize that the emergence of edge computing models, such as fog computing, cloudlet, and mobile edge computing, has transformed the management and operation of farms (Zhang et al., 2020).
Fog computing plays a crucial role in distributing processing and storage across the network, enhancing the scalability and reliability of automated irrigation systems (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022; Singh et al., 2022). Premkumar and Sigappi (2022) evaluate the current state of automated irrigation management systems and propose a hybrid machine learning approach for predicting soil moisture and managing irrigation. Their study emphasizes the potential of fog computing in distributing processing and storage across the network, improving the efficiency and scalability of irrigation systems. The proposed hybrid machine learning approach outperforms other machine learning algorithms in predicting soil moisture, demonstrating the effectiveness of fog computing in enhancing the performance of automated irrigation systems (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022).
Singh et al. (2022) discuss the role of fog computing in distributing processing and storage across the network, enhancing scalability and reliability in agricultural management systems. The authors argue that by implementing fog computing, these systems can achieve faster data processing and response times, improving overall efficiency and effectiveness. They also highlight that fog computing can address the challenges faced by real-time data transmission in agricultural management systems, such as latency, bandwidth limitations, and data security (Singh et al., 2022).
The integration of edge and fog computing in real-time irrigation management systems is crucial for achieving fully automated, scalable, and reliable solutions. As the demand for autonomous irrigation management grows, these technologies will play a pivotal role in enabling faster decision-making, reduced latency, improved resource utilization, and seamless integration across the irrigation management pipeline (Tran et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020). By bringing computation and analytics closer to the data source and distributing processing and storage across the network, edge and fog computing can significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of automated irrigation systems, contributing to the overall goal of addressing the global food challenge through optimized water resource management and increased agricultural productivity (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022; Singh et al., 2022).

3.3. Automation of Data Collection
The automation of data collection is a critical component in the development of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies. It enables the efficient gathering of vital information about crop health, environmental conditions, and water requirements, which is essential for enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity. Two key aspects of automated data collection are the use of advanced sensing technologies for non-invasive plant stress detection and the implementation of wireless sensor networks and energy-efficient communication protocols for large-scale, long-term data collection.
Advanced sensing technologies, such as hyperspectral imaging and thermal sensing, have emerged as powerful tools for non-invasive plant stress detection in automated irrigation management systems. These technologies provide valuable information about crop traits, enabling early and accurate detection of plant health issues (Triantafyllou et al., 2019). Triantafyllou et al. (2019) propose a comprehensive reference architecture model that incorporates advanced sensing technologies in the sensor layer for real-time plant stress detection, highlighting their importance in providing non-invasive plant stress detection. Similarly, Hossain et al. (2023) present a novel IoT-ML-Blockchain integrated framework for smart agricultural management that leverages advanced sensing technologies to optimize water use and improve crop yield, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
Hyperspectral imaging can capture subtle changes in plant physiology that are indicative of stress, while machine learning algorithms can be employed to extract meaningful patterns from the spectral data and classify different stress types (Araus et al., 2014). Thermal sensing can detect changes in canopy temperature, which is influenced by factors such as plant water status (Li et al., 2019). By monitoring canopy temperature and comparing it to reference values, automated irrigation systems can detect plant water stress and trigger irrigation events to maintain optimal plant health and productivity (Li et al., 2019).
The integration of advanced sensing technologies in automated irrigation management systems has the potential to revolutionize precision agriculture. Jiang et al. (2019) demonstrate the effectiveness of a deep learning-based model in accurately detecting leaf spot diseases, highlighting the importance of image augmentation and deep learning algorithms in enhancing the model's performance.
Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and energy-efficient communication protocols have the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and reliability of data collection in large-scale, long-term irrigation systems. WSNs offer a cost-effective and scalable solution for real-time data collection in large-scale irrigation systems, providing remote monitoring and automated control capabilities (Mehdizadeh et al., 2020). Nishiura and Yamamoto (2021) propose a novel sensor network system that utilizes drones and wireless power transfer to autonomously collect environmental data from sensor nodes in vast agricultural fields, reducing operational costs and enhancing the efficiency of data collection. Similarly, Higashiura and Yamamoto (2021) introduce a network system that employs UAVs and LoRa communication to efficiently collect environmental data from sensor nodes distributed across large farmlands, optimizing data collection and reducing travel distance and time.
Energy-efficient communication protocols are crucial for ensuring reliable data transmission in challenging environmental conditions and extending the lifespan of sensor nodes (Mehdizadeh et al., 2020). Al-Ali et al. (2023) investigate the potential of WSNs and energy-efficient communication protocols for data collection in large-scale, long-term irrigation systems, discussing the challenges and opportunities of using these technologies to improve the efficiency and reliability of real-time data collection in irrigation management. Mehdizadeh et al. (2020) emphasize the need for careful consideration of factors such as data accuracy, energy consumption, and network reliability when designing effective WSNs for irrigation management, enabling timely irrigation decisions and improved crop yields.
The automation of data collection through the use of advanced sensing technologies and wireless sensor networks is essential for achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. By enabling non-invasive plant stress detection and large-scale, long-term data collection, these technologies contribute to the overall goal of optimizing water resource management and increasing agricultural productivity. The integration of these technologies in real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems has the potential to enhance agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity, ultimately contributing to the development of fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management solutions.

3.4: Real-Time Data Transmission Protocols and Technologies
Real-time data transmission is a critical component of automated irrigation management systems, as it enables the timely delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of suitable protocols and network architectures is essential for ensuring efficient and reliable data transmission in these systems, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
The Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol has emerged as a popular choice for real-time data transmission in IoT networks, including those used for automated irrigation management. MQTT is a lightweight, publish-subscribe protocol designed for constrained devices and low-bandwidth networks (Author, 2019). Its simplicity and low overhead make it well-suited for IoT applications where data transmission speed and energy efficiency are critical (Saranyadevi et al., 2022). MQTT provides three Quality of Service (QoS) levels, ensuring data reliability in real-time scenarios (Author, 2019). Chen et al. (2020) proposed novel algorithms to improve data exchange efficiency and handle rerouting in MQTT-based IoT networks for automated irrigation management systems. Their TBRouting algorithm efficiently finds the shortest paths for data transmission, while the Rerouting algorithm effectively handles the rerouting of topic-based session flows when a broker crashes. The combination of these algorithms can significantly improve the performance and reliability of automated irrigation management systems (Chen et al., 2020).
Client-server IoT networks, such as those based on MQTT, play a crucial role in real-time data transmission for automated irrigation management systems. In these networks, sensors and devices (clients) publish data to a central broker (server), which then distributes the data to subscribed clients (Verma et al., 2021). This architecture enables efficient data collection, processing, and dissemination, facilitating the integration of various components within the automated irrigation management pipeline. Verma et al. (2021) proposed an architecture for healthcare monitoring systems using IoT and communication protocols, which provides a comprehensive overview of existing approaches and highlights challenges and opportunities in the field. Although focused on healthcare, the insights from this study can be applied to automated irrigation management systems, emphasizing the importance of interoperability and standardization for seamless integration (Verma et al., 2021).
In addition to MQTT, other application layer protocols such as XMPP, CoAP, SOAP, and HTTP have been explored for real-time data transmission in IoT networks. Each protocol has its strengths and weaknesses, making them suitable for different applications and scenarios. XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) is an open-standard protocol that supports real-time messaging, presence, and request-response services (Saint-Andre, 2011). CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) is a specialized web transfer protocol designed for use with constrained nodes and networks in the Internet of Things (Shelby et al., 2014). SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services, while HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web (Fielding et al., 1999).
Motamedi and Villányi (2022) compared and evaluated wireless communication protocols for the implementation of smart irrigation systems in greenhouses, considering factors such as power consumption, range, reliability, and scalability. They found that ZigBee is the most suitable local communication protocol for greenhouse irrigation due to its large number of nodes and long range, while MQTT is the recommended messaging protocol for smart irrigation systems due to its TCP transport protocol and quality of service (QoS) options. GSM is a reliable and cost-effective global communication protocol for greenhouse irrigation, providing wide coverage and low cost (Motamedi & Villányi, 2022).
Syafarinda et al. (2018) investigated the use of the MQTT protocol in a precision agriculture system using a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). They found that MQTT is suitable for use in IoT applications due to its lightweight, simple, and low bandwidth requirements. The average data transmission speed using the MQTT protocol was approximately 1 second, demonstrating its effectiveness for real-time data transmission in precision agriculture systems (Syafarinda et al., 2018).
The choice of application layer protocol for real-time irrigation management depends on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. MQTT and RTPS (Real-Time Publish-Subscribe) are both suitable for real-time data transmission in IoT systems, but they have different strengths and weaknesses. MQTT is a better choice for applications that require low latency and high throughput, while RTPS is a better choice for applications that require high reliability and low latency (Sanchez-Iborra & Skarmeta, 2021). The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of various application layer protocols, provides valuable insights into the suitability of these technologies for real-time data transmission in automated irrigation management systems.
In summary, real-time data transmission protocols and technologies play a vital role in the automation of irrigation management systems, enabling the efficient and reliable delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of application layer protocols, highlights the importance of selecting suitable technologies based on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. By leveraging these technologies, automated irrigation management systems can achieve seamless integration and contribute to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.

3.5. Challenges and Solutions in Real-Time Data Transmission
Following the exploration of data collection, processing at the edge and fog, and automation in previous sections, we now turn to the critical aspect of real-time data transmission. While essential for automated irrigation management, this stage presents unique challenges that must be addressed to ensure system efficiency and reliability.
Obstacles in Real-Time Data Transmission
Agricultural environments present unique challenges for real-time data transmission, directly impacting the effectiveness of automated irrigation systems. Environmental factors can significantly disrupt wireless communication. Adverse weather conditions such as heavy rain, fog, and high winds can weaken or even block radio signals, leading to data loss and compromised system performance. Physical obstacles like trees, buildings, and uneven terrain further complicate signal propagation, creating reliability issues (Jukan et al., 2017; Yi & Ji, 2014; Zhang, Chang & Baoguo, 2018). These environmental challenges necessitate robust communication protocols and network architectures that can ensure consistent and reliable data flow.
In addition to environmental factors, technical limitations also present significant obstacles. Large-scale agricultural operations often demand long-distance data transmission, which can be hindered by the limited range of certain wireless communication protocols. Network congestion, occurring when multiple sensors transmit data concurrently, can lead to delays and potential data loss, further complicating real-time decision-making (Hameed et al., 2020). To mitigate these issues, researchers have investigated the potential of cognitive radio networks (CRNs) and dynamic spectrum access (DSA) for optimizing spectrum utilization and reducing interference (Righi et al., 2017; Shafi et al., 2018; Trigka & Dritsas, 2022). CRNs enable devices to intelligently sense and adapt to the surrounding radio environment, dynamically adjusting transmission parameters to avoid interference and improve communication efficiency. DSA, on the other hand, facilitates the dynamic allocation of unused spectrum, enhancing spectrum utilization and reducing congestion.
Furthermore, data security and privacy are paramount concerns in real-time irrigation systems. The sensitive nature of agricultural data, such as crop yields and farm management practices, necessitates robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches (Gupta et al., 2020). Implementing secure communication protocols, authentication mechanisms, and encryption techniques is essential to protect data integrity and ensure the trustworthiness of the system.
Investigating Data Optimization Techniques
To enhance the efficiency and reliability of real-time data transmission in automated irrigation systems, researchers have explored a range of data optimization techniques. Data compression techniques aim to reduce the size of data packets transmitted over the network, minimizing bandwidth requirements and improving transmission speed (Rady et al., 2020; Karim et al., 2023). Lossless compression algorithms, such as Huffman coding and LZW, preserve data integrity while effectively reducing data size, ensuring that no information is lost during transmission (Cui, 2023). Lossy compression algorithms, such as JPEG and MP3, offer higher compression ratios but introduce a controlled level of data loss, which may be acceptable for certain applications where some loss of precision is tolerable (Karim et al., 2023). The choice between lossless and lossy compression depends on the specific application and the trade-off between data size and accuracy.
Data aggregation techniques provide another effective approach to optimize data transmission. By aggregating multiple sensor readings into a single representative value, such as average soil moisture or temperature, the number of transmissions can be significantly reduced, conserving bandwidth and energy resources (Cui, 2023). This is particularly beneficial in large-scale irrigation systems where numerous sensors are deployed across vast areas, generating substantial amounts of data. Additionally, data filtering techniques play a crucial role in improving data quality and reliability. Kalman filters and particle filters can effectively remove noise and outliers from sensor data, ensuring that only accurate and relevant information is transmitted and used for decision-making (Cui, 2023). This is essential for preventing erroneous data from influencing irrigation decisions and potentially leading to suboptimal water management.
Sensor calibration, drift correction, and fault detection are essential for maintaining data accuracy and reliability (Dos Santos et al., 2023). Regular calibration ensures that sensors provide accurate measurements over time, while drift correction techniques account for gradual changes in sensor readings due to environmental factors or aging. Fault detection mechanisms can identify and address sensor malfunctions or anomalies, preventing erroneous data from influencing irrigation decisions and potentially harming crops or wasting water.
Addressing the Challenges
Effectively addressing the challenges in real-time data transmission requires a multifaceted approach that encompasses environmental, technical, and data-related considerations. Implementing robust and adaptive communication protocols is crucial for overcoming interference and signal degradation caused by weather conditions and physical obstacles. Selecting appropriate protocols, such as LoRa or ZigBee, with suitable range and penetration capabilities can ensure reliable data transmission in challenging agricultural environments (Motamedi & Villányi, 2022). Additionally, employing techniques like frequency hopping and error correction codes can further improve communication resilience and mitigate data loss.
Optimizing network architecture is another key consideration. Deploying a distributed network architecture with edge and fog computing capabilities can significantly enhance data processing and transmission efficiency (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2019). Edge devices can perform initial data processing and aggregation tasks, reducing the amount of data transmitted to the cloud and minimizing latency, while fog nodes can provide additional processing power and storage closer to the data source, enhancing scalability and reliability. This distributed approach alleviates the burden on the central cloud server and allows for more responsive and efficient irrigation management.
Data optimization techniques play a vital role in reducing bandwidth requirements and improving transmission efficiency. The choice of data compression, aggregation, and filtering techniques should be tailored to the specific requirements of the irrigation system, considering factors such as data type, accuracy needs, and available bandwidth. By carefully selecting and implementing these techniques, the overall performance and effectiveness of real-time irrigation systems can be significantly enhanced, leading to more sustainable water management practices and improved agricultural productivity.
By addressing these challenges and implementing appropriate solutions, real-time data transmission can become a reliable and efficient component of automated irrigation systems, contributing to the overall goal of achieving sustainable and productive agriculture in the face of growing food demands and water scarcity.

3.6. IoT Network Architectures and Variable Rate Irrigation (VRI) for Real-Time Irrigation
Real-time irrigation management systems heavily rely on the efficient and reliable transmission of data from sensors and weather stations to the cloud for processing and decision-making. However, agricultural environments present unique challenges to wireless communication, including adverse weather conditions, physical obstacles, and the limitations of wireless technologies. These challenges necessitate robust and adaptive solutions to ensure the consistent and timely flow of data, enabling truly autonomous irrigation scheduling.
Environmental factors, such as heavy rain, fog, and strong winds, can significantly disrupt wireless communication by attenuating or even blocking radio signals, leading to data loss and compromised system performance (Ed-daoudi et al., 2023; Jukan et al., 2017; Yi & Ji, 2014; Zhang, Chang & Baoguo, 2018). Dense vegetation, buildings, and uneven terrain create further complications by causing multipath propagation and shadowing effects (Yim et al., 2018; Gautam and Pagay, 2020). The study by Yim et al. (2018) on LoRa networks in a tree farm environment exemplifies these challenges, revealing reduced communication range and data reliability compared to theoretical expectations. This underscores the need for carefully selecting and optimizing communication protocols and network parameters to ensure reliable data transmission in such environments.
The study by Guzinski et al. (2014a) using a modified TSEB model further highlights the importance of high-resolution data in accurately capturing the spatial and temporal dynamics of energy fluxes influenced by environmental factors. This emphasizes the need for advanced data acquisition and processing techniques that can effectively represent the complexities of agricultural settings.
The limitations of traditional wireless communication technologies, such as limited range and network congestion, pose additional challenges for large-scale agricultural operations. Long-distance data transmission can be hindered by range limitations, while network congestion arising from numerous sensors transmitting concurrently can lead to delays and data loss, hindering real-time decision-making (Hameed et al., 2020). Addressing these challenges requires the exploration of advanced networking technologies that can optimize spectrum utilization, mitigate interference, and improve reliability and efficiency.
Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) and Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) offer promising solutions for optimizing wireless communication in agricultural settings. CRNs empower devices with the ability to intelligently sense and adapt to the surrounding radio environment, dynamically adjusting transmission parameters to avoid interference and improve communication efficiency (Righi et al., 2017; Shafi et al., 2018; Trigka & Dritsas, 2022). Research has explored the potential of CRNs in predicting Radio Frequency (RF) power to avoid noisy channels and optimize spectrum utilization (Iliya et al., 2014; Iliya et al., 2014). These studies demonstrate the effectiveness of combining optimization algorithms with artificial neural networks (ANNs) to enhance the accuracy and generalization of RF power prediction, enabling CRNs to make informed decisions about channel selection and avoid interference.
DSA complements CRN technology by dynamically allocating unused spectrum, further enhancing spectrum utilization and reducing congestion (Shi et al., 2023). The numerical model developed by Shi et al. (2023) showcases the potential of CRNs and DSA for optimizing wireless communication in challenging environments.
The integration of CRNs and DSA into the IoT network architecture requires careful consideration of spectrum sensing techniques, network topology, and data security. Research on cooperative spectrum sensing suggests that distributed approaches, where sensor nodes collaborate and share information, can significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of spectrum sensing, particularly in dynamic environments (Trigka and Dritsas, 2022; Khalid & Yu, 2019). This collaborative approach enables a more comprehensive understanding of the radio environment and facilitates the identification of available frequency bands for data transmission.
The choice of network topology also impacts the performance and scalability of CRN-based irrigation systems. Mesh networks, where sensor nodes are interconnected and relay data for each other, offer enhanced resilience and coverage compared to star topologies where nodes communicate directly with a central gateway (Akyildiz & Vuran, 2010). However, mesh networks can be more complex to manage and may introduce additional routing overhead. The trade-off between network resilience and complexity needs to be carefully evaluated to select the most appropriate topology for a specific agricultural setting.
Data security and privacy are paramount concerns in IoT-based irrigation systems due to the sensitive nature of agricultural data (Gupta et al., 2020). Implementing secure communication protocols, authentication mechanisms, and encryption techniques is essential for protecting data integrity and ensuring system trustworthiness. Research on secure spectrum leasing and resource allocation algorithms for CR-WSN-based irrigation systems has demonstrated the potential of these technologies for enhancing security and efficiency (Hassan, 2023; Afghah et al., 2018).
In conclusion, the development of effective and reliable real-time irrigation management systems requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the challenges of data transmission in agricultural environments. The integration of robust and adaptive communication protocols, optimized network architectures, and advanced networking technologies like CRNs and DSA, along with a focus on data security and privacy, can contribute significantly to achieving the goal of autonomous and efficient irrigation scheduling.
4. AUTOMATED DATA PROCESSING IN THE CLOUD
4.1. Data Quality and Preprocessing
Data quality is paramount in automated irrigation systems as it directly influences the effectiveness of decision-making and water use efficiency. Issues like missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers arising from sensor malfunctions, environmental interference, or network problems (Lv et al., 2023) can significantly impact the performance of machine learning models used for irrigation scheduling and management.
Real-time data cleaning techniques are essential for addressing these challenges. Kalman filtering proves particularly effective in handling missing values and correcting erroneous readings by recursively estimating the system's state based on previous measurements and current sensor data, taking into account noise and uncertainty (Kim et al., 2020). Moving average techniques, by averaging consecutive data points, provide a more stable representation of the underlying trend, filtering out short-term fluctuations (Chhetri, 2023). For outlier detection, adaptive thresholding methods offer a dynamic approach, adjusting thresholds based on the statistical properties of the data to effectively identify anomalies and minimize false positives (Bah et al., 2021). These techniques are crucial in maintaining the integrity of real-time data streams and ensuring the accuracy of subsequent analyses.
Adaptive data preprocessing is essential for managing the diversity of data sources and formats commonly found in irrigation systems. Data normalization techniques, such as min-max scaling or z-score normalization, ensure that all features contribute equally to the analysis by transforming data values to a common scale (Pradal et al., 2016). This is crucial for preventing features with larger values from dominating the analysis and ensuring that all features are given equal consideration. Similarly, feature scaling methods, like standardization or normalization, optimize the range of feature values to improve the performance and convergence of machine learning models (Tortorici et al., 2024). By scaling features to a similar range, the influence of outliers is reduced, and the model's ability to learn from the data is enhanced.
Data fusion techniques play a critical role in integrating information from diverse sources, creating a more comprehensive and reliable dataset for irrigation management. Dempster-Shafer theory, a generalization of probability theory, allows for the expression of both uncertainty and the degree of conflict in evidence, making it suitable for fusing uncertain and conflicting data from heterogeneous sources (Sadiq and Rodriguez, 2004). This is particularly relevant in irrigation systems where data from different sensors may provide slightly different or even contradictory information due to sensor variations or environmental factors. Bayesian inference offers another powerful framework for combining information from multiple sources, updating the probability of a hypothesis as new evidence becomes available. By applying these techniques, data from soil moisture sensors, canopy temperature sensors, weather stations, and other sources can be integrated to provide a holistic understanding of crop water requirements and environmental conditions, leading to more informed and accurate irrigation decisions.
The impact of data quality extends beyond model accuracy to the robustness of machine learning models under varying conditions. Robust models should maintain consistent performance even when faced with data inconsistencies or unexpected situations. Techniques like data augmentation and domain adaptation can enhance model robustness by exposing the model to a wider range of data variations during training. Data augmentation involves generating additional training data by applying transformations or introducing noise to existing data, making the model more resilient to noise and variations in the real-world data. Domain adaptation techniques aim to adapt a model trained on one domain (e.g., a specific crop or geographic location) to perform well on another domain with different data characteristics. This is particularly relevant in irrigation management, where models may need to be applied to different crops, soil types, or climatic conditions.
The choice of data cleaning, preprocessing, and fusion techniques should be carefully considered based on the specific characteristics of the irrigation system and the available data. By selecting and implementing appropriate techniques, the accuracy, reliability, and robustness of machine learning models can be significantly improved, leading to more efficient and sustainable irrigation management practices.
4.2. Scalable and Autonomous Deployment using Containerization Strategies
The transition from data collection and transmission to efficient data processing requires a robust infrastructure capable of handling diverse workloads and data volumes. Containerization technologies, specifically Docker and Kubernetes, offer a promising solution for deploying and scaling data processing and machine learning modules within cloud environments like AWS, Azure, and GCP (Vargas-Rojas et al., 2024; Rosendo et al., 2022; Solayman & Qasha, 2023). Docker provides a standardized way to package applications and their dependencies into self-contained units known as containers, ensuring consistent and reproducible execution across different platforms (Rosendo et al., 2022). Kubernetes, acting as a container orchestrator, manages their deployment, scaling, and networking across a cluster of machines (Rosendo et al., 2022). This combination presents several advantages for automated irrigation management systems.
Firstly, containerization facilitates efficient resource utilization and scalability. By encapsulating applications and their dependencies, containers enable the isolation of resources and prevent conflicts between different modules (Vargas-Rojas et al., 2024; Solayman & Qasha, 2023). This isolation allows for the efficient allocation of resources, such as CPU, memory, and storage, to each container based on its specific needs. Kubernetes further enhances scalability by allowing for the automatic scaling of containers based on real-time demand, ensuring the system can adapt to varying workloads and data volumes, preventing bottlenecks, and ensuring responsiveness to changing conditions (Karamolegkos et al., 2023).
Secondly, containerization promotes portability and reproducibility. By packaging applications and their dependencies into a single unit, containers make it easy to move and deploy them across different cloud environments without the need for environment-specific configurations (Rosendo et al., 2022; Solayman & Qasha, 2023). This portability simplifies the development and deployment process, reducing the time and effort required to set up and manage the system. Additionally, containers ensure reproducibility by providing a consistent execution environment, regardless of the underlying infrastructure. This eliminates variability and ensures that the system will behave consistently across different deployments (Zhou et al., 2023).
Optimizing container orchestration and resource allocation is crucial to minimizing latency and maximizing throughput in real-time data processing pipelines. Techniques like auto-scaling and dynamic resource allocation play a critical role in this context (Hethcoat et al., 2024; Werner and Tai, 2023; Kumar et al., 2024). Auto-scaling automatically adjusts the number of container instances based on real-time demand, ensuring that sufficient resources are available to handle peak workloads while avoiding over-provisioning during periods of low demand (Hethcoat et al., 2024; Kumar et al., 2024). Dynamic resource allocation enables the fine-grained adjustment of resources allocated to each container based on its specific needs and the current workload (Werner and Tai, 2023). This ensures efficient resource allocation and provides each container with the necessary resources to perform its tasks effectively.
Performance monitoring tools, such as Kubernetes Metrics Server and Prometheus, are essential for gaining insights into the performance of containers and the overall system (Hethcoat et al., 2024; Kuity & Peddoju, 2023). These tools provide valuable data on key performance indicators, such as CPU and memory usage, network traffic, and application-specific metrics. By monitoring this data, administrators can identify bottlenecks, optimize resource allocation strategies, and continuously improve system performance (Hethcoat et al., 2024). This data-driven approach ensures that automated irrigation management systems can operate efficiently and reliably.
By integrating containerization technologies with optimization techniques and performance monitoring, automated irrigation management systems achieve the scalability, autonomy, and efficiency required for effective real-time data processing and decision-making. This approach facilitates a seamless and responsive system that can adapt to changing conditions and contribute to the overall goal of optimizing water resource management and increasing agricultural productivity.

4.3. Deploying ML Models for Data Processing
Transitioning from data collection, preprocessing, and transmission, the deployment of machine learning (ML) models marks a pivotal stage in the automated irrigation management pipeline. This stage entails utilizing cloud platforms to facilitate real-time data processing and inference, enabling data-driven decision-making for optimal irrigation management and ultimately contributing to fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.
Several architectures and frameworks exist for deploying ML models on cloud platforms, each offering unique advantages and catering to different requirements. TensorFlow Serving, for instance, provides a high-performance system specifically designed for serving TensorFlow models (Abadi et al., 2016). This framework enables efficient and scalable inference, making it suitable for real-time applications where low latency and high throughput are crucial. For instance, in a large-scale irrigation system with numerous sensors generating data continuously, TensorFlow Serving can efficiently handle the high volume of inference requests and provide timely predictions for irrigation scheduling. Similarly, Apache MXNet Model Server offers a flexible and efficient solution for deploying models trained with MXNet, supporting a wide range of deep learning models and inference backends (MXNet Developers, 2015). This versatility makes it suitable for complex irrigation systems that may utilize different types of ML models for various tasks, such as predicting crop water requirements, detecting plant stress, or forecasting weather conditions. ONNX Runtime, on the other hand, provides a cross-platform inference engine compatible with various ML frameworks, including PyTorch, TensorFlow, and MXNet (Microsoft, 2017). This versatility enables the deployment of models in diverse environments, facilitating interoperability and reducing the need for model conversion. For example, an irrigation system that uses models trained in different frameworks can utilize ONNX Runtime to deploy them on a single platform without the need for time-consuming and error-prone model conversion processes.
Choosing the appropriate architecture or framework depends on several factors, including the specific ML framework used for model training, the desired level of performance and scalability, and the need for cross-platform compatibility. For instance, if the primary concern is low latency and high throughput for real-time inference, TensorFlow Serving might be the optimal choice for TensorFlow models. However, if flexibility and support for various deep learning models are required, Apache MXNet Model Server could be more suitable. In cases where cross-platform compatibility is essential, ONNX Runtime offers a versatile solution.
Once the ML model is deployed, optimizing its performance and resource utilization becomes crucial for ensuring the efficiency of integrated end-to-end automated irrigation systems. Model compression techniques, such as pruning and quantization, offer effective methods for reducing the size and computational requirements of ML models without compromising accuracy (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). Pruning involves eliminating unnecessary connections or neurons from the model, effectively streamlining its structure and reducing computational complexity. This can be particularly beneficial for deep learning models, which often have a large number of parameters and can be prone to overfitting. By removing redundant or less important connections, pruning can improve modelgeneralizability and reduce inference time. Quantization, on the other hand, involves reducing the precision of model parameters, typically from 32-bit floating-point numbers to lower-precision formats such as 8-bit integers. This reduction in precision leads to smaller model sizes and faster inference speeds, making it particularly beneficial for resource-constrained environments or real-time applications. For instance, in edge computing scenarios where ML models are deployed on devices with limited computational resources, quantization can enable efficient inference without sacrificing accuracy.
Furthermore, hardware acceleration through the utilization of GPUs or TPUs can significantly enhance model performance by leveraging specialized hardware designed for parallel processing (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). GPUs, with their massive parallelism and high memory bandwidth, excel at accelerating matrix operations and convolutions, which are fundamental computations in many deep learning models. This acceleration can significantly reduce inference time and enable real-time processing of sensor data for timely irrigation decisions. TPUs, specifically designed for deep learning workloads, offer even greater performance and energy efficiency for specific model architectures. These hardware accelerators can drastically reduce inference time, enabling near real-time decision-making and enhancing the responsiveness of automated irrigation systems. For example, in a scenario where immediate response to changing weather conditions or soil moisture levels is critical, hardware acceleration can ensure that irrigation decisions are made and executed promptly.
In addition to model compression and hardware acceleration, distributed training techniques play a crucial role in optimizing the training process for large-scale ML models. Techniques such as Horovod and BytePS enable the distribution of training across multiple machines, effectively parallelizing the process and reducing training time (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). This is particularly beneficial for complex models with a large number of parameters or when dealing with large datasets. By leveraging distributed training, irrigation management systems can train more sophisticated models and improve their predictive capabilities, leading to more accurate and efficient irrigation decisions. For instance, a system that utilizes a deep learning model with millions of parameters can benefit from distributed training to reduce training time from days to hours, enabling faster model iteration and improvement.
Integrating the deployed ML models with other components of the automated irrigation management pipeline is essential for achieving a fully autonomous and cohesive system and addressing the need for seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system. Standardized protocols, such as MQTT and CoAP, provide lightweight and efficient communication channels for exchanging data between these components (Poojara et al., 2023; Jimenez et al., 2020a; Gour et al., 2023). MQTT, with its publish-subscribe architecture, enables real-time data streaming and event-driven communication, making it suitable for transmitting sensor data, control signals, and inference results (Raikar & M, 2023). This enables the ML model to receive real-time updates on soil moisture, weather conditions, and plant health, allowing for dynamic adjustments to irrigation schedules based on the latest data. CoAP, designed for constrained devices and low-power networks, offers a web-transfer protocol for resource-constrained environments, enabling efficient communication between sensors, actuators, and the ML models (Raikar & M, 2023). This is particularly relevant in situations where sensors or actuators have limited processing power or battery life, as CoAP minimizes communication overhead and energy consumption. Additionally, RESTful APIs provide a standardized interface for accessing and controlling the ML models, enabling seamless integration with other software components and facilitating system management and monitoring (Wang et al., 2022). This allows for easy integration with existing farm management systems or third-party applications, creating a unified platform for comprehensive irrigation management.4.4. Online Learning in the Cloud
The complexities of real-time data processing in irrigation management necessitate the exploration of advanced techniques to continuously learn and adapt to the dynamic nature of agricultural environments. Online learning algorithms offer a promising solution, enabling the continuous update and improvement of machine learning models based on incoming real-time data. This adaptability is crucial for addressing the challenges of changing environmental conditions, such as weather patterns and crop growth stages, and optimizing irrigation decision-making to enhance water usage efficiency and crop productivity.
Several online learning algorithms have demonstrated potential for real-time data processing and model adaptation in the context of irrigation management. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) facilitates the incremental update of model parameters with each new data point, allowing for efficient adaptation to changing data distributions (Bottou, 2010). This incremental learning process ensures that the model remains responsive to the latest conditions, minimizing the risk of outdated predictions and improving the accuracy of irrigation decisions. Passive-Aggressive algorithms, on the other hand, adjust model parameters only when a misclassification occurs, providing a computationally efficient approach for handling large data streams (Crammer et al., 2006). These algorithms offer a robust approach to handling noisy data, a common challenge in real-world sensor readings, by making small adjustments only when the model's prediction deviates significantly from the actual value (Fei et al., 2019). Online Random Forests extend the concept of random forests to the online setting, enabling the incremental construction and update of decision trees as new data arrives (Saffari et al., 2009). The continuous evolution of the ensemble ensures that the model remains relevant to the changing environment, capturing intricate relationships between variables and leading to more informed irrigation decisions.
Research in various domains highlights the importance of online learning for real-time data stream analytics. Snyder et al. (2020) explored the application of online learning techniques for identifying relevant tweets in real-time, improving situational awareness for first responders. The proposed interactive learning framework allows users to continuously label the relevance of incoming tweets, enabling the real-time refinement of the underlying machine learning model. This user-guided approach aligns well with the dynamic nature of irrigation management, where models need to continuously adjust to varying environmental conditions and crop water requirements. Similarly, research in the field of cyber-physical systems (CPS) underscores the need for online learning algorithms to effectively extract insights and knowledge from continuously generated data streams (Fei et al., 2019). These capabilities are crucial for enabling feedback loops between physical processes and cyber elements, facilitating the integration and optimization of CPS in irrigation management systems.
To implement online learning in cloud-based irrigation management systems, various architectures and frameworks can be considered. Apache Spark Streaming, Apache Flink, and AWS Kinesis provide scalable and fault-tolerant platforms for processing real-time data streams, allowing for the development of online learning pipelines that continuously ingest and analyze data to update machine learning models (Zaharia et al., 2012; Carbone et al., 2015; Amazon Web Services, 2023). These frameworks leverage serverless computing paradigms, automatically scaling resources based on the volume and velocity of incoming data, ensuring efficient resource utilization and responsiveness to fluctuations in demand (Fei et al., 2019).
Effectively managing the exploration-exploitation trade-off is crucial for optimizing online learning in irrigation management. Techniques such as Multi-armed bandits (Sutton & Barto, 2018), Bayesian optimization (Shahriari et al., 2016), and Reinforcement Learning (RL) (Sutton & Barto, 2018) can be employed to balance the allocation of resources between exploring new irrigation strategies and exploiting the current best-performing approaches. These techniques enable the identification of optimal irrigation policies, adapting to changing environmental conditions and maximizing long-term rewards.
In conclusion, online learning techniques, coupled with scalable cloud-based architectures, offer a powerful solution for real-time data processing and continuous adaptation in irrigation management systems. By leveraging algorithms like SGD, Passive-Aggressive, and Online Random Forests, along with stream processing frameworks like Apache Spark Streaming, Apache Flink, and AWS Kinesis, irrigation management systems can effectively handle the complexities of real-time data, optimize water usage, and enhance crop productivity in the face of dynamic environmental conditions.

  Explanation: The proposed intelligent monitoring system for the greenhouse microclimate is based on the integration of two optimization stages, an optimizer stage and a RBFNN stage, with the main objective of finding the optimal setpoints for the critical variables (temperature and relative humidity) and reducing energy use to a minimum while maintaining the best indoor climate. The optimizer stage utilizes the non-dominating sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) to determine the optimal setpoints for the PID controllers, while the RBFNN stage, a machine-learning approach, is employed to replace the optimizer and provide the PID controllers with the optimal setpoints at any climatic conditions that the greenhouse is exposed to with minimal energy use.

Abstract The greenhouse climate is a complex dynamic system that requires careful optimization to achieve maximum plant growth with minimum energy consumption. The energy used by greenhouse (GH) actuators has an indirect but detrimental effect on profits. In multi-input/multi-output systems, conventional proportional–integral–derivative (PID) controllers are unable to determine the desired setpoints for the greenhouse microclimate. In this study, an innovative approach to monitoring the greenhouse microclimate is proposed, the Guidance Control Unit (GCU), which optimizes the setpoints of PID controllers for energy efficiency. The proposed system goes through two stages. The first uses Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) to minimize greenhouse energy consumption based on optimal setpoints generated using the non-dominating sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II). The second stage replaces the MOO with a machine-learning approach — the Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN). After training and testing the RBFNN offline on the generated data, it was used to detect the optimal setpoints for the PID controllers in any weather conditions. The resulting setpoints represent two critical climatic variables, indoor temperature and relative humidity, and are provided to the PID controllers with values that take account of external disturbances. The proposed system showed good detection of the optimal setpoints and maintained the greenhouse system’s energy efficiency at over 25.88%, the overshoot at less 10.92% and rise time showed 11.27 % with an average RMSE of 0.069 for the RBFNN. There was only a minor (0.0017%) difference in prediction error between the results using RBFNN and NSGA-II. The proposed system fulfilled the study’s objectives by detection the optimal setpoints of PID controllers while saving energy and can also be applied to other complex systems, such as industrial buildings, that require more than one optimization step.

Motivation and state of the art of the study Agriculture is a key sector in the global effort towards sustainability. However, recent shifts have led to serious considerations regarding implementing modern agricultural production systems. Environmental changes, increasing pollution (for instance, the Netherlands plans to close its remaining coal plants by 2030 as part of a strategy to reduce CO2 emissions by 25% before 2020, a goal likely unattainable due to cost constraints [1]), a steadily increasing global population (it is projected that by 2050, the world’s population will reach 10 billion [2]), and a lack of food security (South Africa has experienced a decrease of up to 35% in food security [3]), and the world’s declining water resources, are but a few. Consequently, it is necessary to consider and implement innovative approaches to agricultural production in order to enhance both crop yield and quality. E. Iddio et al. & T. Karanisa et al. contend that greenhouse (GH) cultivation is one of the most effective current methods to secure food production [4], [5]. Furthermore, greenhouses are highly efficient cultivation systems that can produce yields per unit area that are up to 10 times higher than traditional open-field cultivation methods [6], [7]. This predominance of the GH in production comes from several reasons, the most important of which are: controlled environment, extended growing season, protection from external factors, efficient resource utilization, crop customization, and reduced losses. Nonetheless, greenhouses (GHs) are highly non-linear, strongly coupled, Multi-Input/Multi-Output (MIMO) systems, and are greatly affected by outside and inside climate conditions [8]. The GH climate can be modified to provide an optimal environment by adding ventilation, heating, fogging, and CO2 enrichment systems to create an ideal microclimate for plants making them very energy intensive [9], [10]. Moreover, Shen et al. and E. Ravishankar et al. state that the energy use accounts for 50% of the overall production costs in GH systems and the technology employed to regulate the microclimate has a significant impact on the energy consumption [11], [12]. Therefore, in practice, the complexity of the GH climate makes its control extremely difficult. Likewise, it is well recognized that interior temperature and relative humidity are intricately linked and must be controlled to enhance the energy efficiency of GHs. Currently, there are two different routines for optimal control in GH cultivation. One approach involves searching for optimal control strategies based on economic performance criteria, such as total profit, and using these strategies to regulate the indoor climate. The other approach focuses on finding the optimal setpoints for GH climate by solving optimization problems related to energy consumption. However, both routines face significant challenges. The crop growth and climate system are two subsystems with different timescales, making it difficult for conventional control methods to handle the complexity. Long-term weather forecasts are unreliable due to uncertainty. Inaccurate models of crop growth and GH climate further complicate optimal control approaches. High-dimensional non-convex optimization problems and numerous states and control constraints also pose difficulties in finding globally optimal solutions [13]. Thus, intelligent monitoring of the greenhouse climate is essential to finding the optimal set point for healthy plant growth and thus increasing energy efficiency. Accordingly, for decades researchers have concentrated their attention on enhancing the greenhouses’ microclimate using different types of controllers [14]. Examples include predictive controllers [15], [16], fuzzy logic controllers [17], [18], optimal controllers [19], [20], adaptive controllers [21], robust controllers [22], PID controllers [23], etc. However, the vast majority of these controllers could not meet the real requirements of the GH systems, due to the dynamic and complex environments of the greenhouses. On the other hand, most automatic control systems in industry employ PID controllers to regulate many different variables, including flow, temperature, pressure, etc. This is because PID controllers’ straightforward structure, reliability, and simplicity of use has resulted in their being adopted in 95% of industrial and manufacturing operations [24], [25]. Although PID controllers are widely used, their performance still depends on their ability to define the appropriate setpoints when used in MIMO systems. Moreover, PIDs have significant quality limitations as they account for neither the complexity of nonlinear dynamics and operational uncertainty, nor system disturbance effects [26]. Therefore, the GH microclimate presents a serious challenge for traditional PID controllers. However, the optimal GH climate setpoint has a significant impact on both energy consumption and crop yield. Therefore, unpredictable weather introduces complexity in solving this optimization problem. To address this challenge, Y. Su and L. Xu proposed an online receding horizon MOO that considers the trade-off between total energy consumption and final crop yield, resulting in a set of favourable GH climate setpoints [27]. Recently, advanced artificial intelligence (AI) control techniques have been implemented using fuzzy logic and neural networks. A. Labidi et al. present a greenhouse environmental control system that utilizes fuzzy logic to manage and regulate humidity setpoint [28]. M.C. Subin et al. designed a Fuzzy PID controller based on the Mamdani model to achieve a smooth control procedure to ensuring stability in greenhouse climate control [29]. J. Riahi et al. proposed a dynamic model and a fuzzy controller for smart control of indoor temperature and humidity setpoints in a greenhouse [8]. T. Petrakis et al. proposed a multilayer perceptron (MLP) model to estimate indoor temperature and relative humidity of the GH climate [30]. Francik and Kurpaska found a three-layer MLP with 10 neurons in the hidden layer to be the most effective of all tested networks in a study conducted in a heated foil tunnel [31]. F. Mahmood et al. proposed a robust model predictive control (MPC) framework for energy use assessment and temperature setpoint prediction in a semi-closed greenhouse [32]. A. Daliran et al. used an ANN models, including MLP, RBF, and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), were used for modelling temperature and mass of dried mint in a Quonset greenhouse solar dryer (GSD) [33]. Similarly, Trejo-Perea developed an algorithm for predicting the energy demand in greenhouses based on multiple regression and ANN models. L. Belhaj Salah and F. Fourati use deep neural networks to improve greenhouse modelling and control [34]. Although several researchers and practitioners have provided some very fruitful versions of their own, the question of establishing a comprehensive monitoring system for GH remains an untouched problem. According to our acquired knowledge, we know that in order to conduct a comprehensive monitoring system for GH, we must find the optimal setpoints for the critical variables with direct influence of the GH climate. However, most previous studies have focused only on prediction of the environment of the GH system and some of them consider only one factor of the GH climate. On the other hand, the majority of these studies lack the actual value of GHs energy reduction and have only focused on its prediction. Furthermore, many of the control systems that have been developed have limited use, for example, they are used only in large greenhouses or only in small greenhouses, in addition to the complexity of their design and implementation [35]. 1.2. Contribution of the study The main objective of this study is to model an intelligent monitoring system for greenhouse climate using artificial intelligence techniques, called (GCU-PID) that is able to: 1. Finding the optimal setpoints for the critical variables (temperature and relative humidity of the GH microclimate). 2. Reducing energy use to a minimum while maintaining the best indoor climate. 3. Improving the efficiency of the traditional PID controllers by determining the setpoint of non-linear, dynamic, and MIMO systems. The novelty of this study was stated by finding the optimal setpoints for the GH system through the traditional PID controllers away from manipulating with their basic parameters ( ). The GCU works in two stages: the first stage is the optimizer stage that uses NSGA-II to determine the optimal setpoints for the PID controllers. The NSGA-II works in conjunction with the mathematical model of the GH created using MATLAB/SIMULINK. Then, NSGA-II is used to calculate the percentage of energy consumption reduction corresponding to the optimal setpoints using the objective function. The second stage is to replace the optimizer with RBFNN after training and testing it offline to provide the PID controllers loop with the optimal setpoints at any climatic conditions that the greenhouse is exposed to with the minimal energy use. In this way, there is no need to use different values of the PID parameters ( ) which is a difficult task and mainly depend on the designers’ experience. In addition, regulation of PID parameters is time costly and incorrect selections lead to poor control performance. Therefore, all these drawbacks were avoided by this proposed system. The rest of paper is laid out as follows: greenhouse microclimate modelling is detailed in Section 2; the monitoring system design is presented in Section 3; the results and discussions are described in Section 4 before concluding in Section 5. 2. Greenhouse microclimate modelling 2.1. Greenhouse microclimate description A description of the GH microclimate system is provided in this section. Fig. 1 illustrates the interaction between the GH microclimate, the control inputs, external disturbances, and the GH yield in a schematic manner. The mass/energy balance equations has traditionally been used to describe the microclimate of GHs [36]. These equations are employed to estimate the rate of change in the GH system. Similarly, state variables for the GH would be: temperature, relative humidity, PAR, and concentration. The plant state variables would be: content, organ temperature, dry weight (biomass), and leaf level. Most analytical dynamic models of the GH microclimate are based on the following state equation form: (1) In which: represents the climate state variables; are the plant state variables; is the control input such as heating, fogging, ventilation and supply flux systems, and represents external disturbances, and finally; is the nonlinear function. In the challenge of obtaining the optimal setpoints for the GH microclimate based on Eq. (1), the following two-parameter classes must be considered: Download : Download high-res image (317KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Physical, biological, and mechanical processes that occur within a typical GH microclimate [Drawn By Author]. 1. Outdoor GH environment, i.e., outside temperature, outside relative humidity, intensity of solar radiation, maximum and minimum wind speed and the concentration. 2. Indoor GH environment which must be assessed by measuring inside air temperature and relative humidity. To achieve the optimal monitoring of the parameters affecting the GH microclimate, it is essential to consider the crop requirements and the economic parameters. These economic parameters must provide minimum energy consumption expenditures [37]. There are two major economic parameters that have a significant impact on the GH’s microclimate. The first parameter is the GH air temperature ( ) provided by the heaters and the second is the GH relative humidity ( ) provided by the fogging system. The analytic expression for GH microclimate is based on the following inputs: heating, fogging, injection, and ventilation as demonstrated by previous research in the field [38], [39]. Therefore, the interaction between the GH climate, crop subsystems, control inputs, and external signals creates a complex and highly non-linear dynamical system within the GH climate system. Consequently, modelling this entire system is a challenging task that requires consideration of numerous factors. The following subsection presents the governing equations of GH microclimate. 2.2. Governing equations In this section, we provide a briefly present of the governing equations that regulate the GH microclimate. Many aspects of the GH need to be considered to solve the microclimate control/monitoring problem. These include the heat exchange with the cover and soil, heat gains from the sun, thermal energy lost by crop transpiration, and thermal energy released by condensation of water vapour in the structural cover. The energy balance of the GH microclimate is a multidimensional quantity that consists of heat transfer and mass exchange in and out of the GH system [40]. The following paragraphs present the differential equations used to describe the mass/energy balance equations of a GH climate [41], [42], [43]. In order to simulate the indoor temperature of the GH system, the system must first be separated into its six constituent parts. These parts are the cover temperature, indoor air temperature, soil surface temperature, vegetation temperature, and two soil sub-layer temperatures as shown in the above Fig. 1. Using mass/energy balance equations with the assumption of a lumped system simplifies system equations from second-order partial differential equations in both space and time, to first-order differential equations in time. Therefore, to solve GH climate control/monitoring problems it is necessary to consider all parts of the GH and its contents. This includes the heat exchange with the cover and with the soil; sensible heat gains from the sun; sensible thermal loss energy by crop transpiration; and thermal energy released by condensation of water vapour in the structural cover. Therefore, the energy balance equation according to Fig. 1 can be expressed as follows: (2) In which: is the net total change in energy (in Watts), is the energy acquired by the GH (in Watts), and is the energy lost by the GH (in Watts). The two terms in Eq. (2) must first be found to determine the total energy change inside the GH. For the sake of brevity, only the main equations that were used in the simulation process of the present study are mentioned here without the subsidiary equations. Therefore, the following equations will be used for simulation purposes in MATLAB/SIMULINK for indoor greenhouse temperature and humidity [42], [43]: (3) Table 1.

One of the most important factors affecting plant growth inside a GH is the relative humidity. Relative humidity affects plant health and growth rate through its effect on the level of water evaporation. High humidity causes mildew, while low humidity dehydrates the plant and reduces photosynthesis. Temperature and relative humidity are closely related to the nonlinear laws of thermodynamics. The relative humidity decreases with increasing temperature if the water content of the air remains constant. Therefore, relative humidity increases at night and decreases during the day, according to the changes in solar energy. The model describing changes in the water vapour content of the air inside the GH is based on the mass balance equation. The main source of water vapour in the equilibrium equation is plant transpiration. The water vapour in the air inside a GH decreases due to condensation on the inner side of the cover. Mass transfer due to ventilation can occur in both directions depending on the weather conditions inside and outside the GH [44], [45]. The humidity ratio inside the greenhouse per unit area can take the following form: (4) In which: are the indoor and outdoor humidity ratios (water vapour mass ratio, of dry air); is the overall coefficient for shading and leaf area index, is the overall coefficient for thermodynamic constants and other factors affecting evapotranspiration (i.e., stomata, air motion, etc.) Definitions of all remaining parameters of Eq. (4) is as defined in Eq. (3). Table 1 presents a list of constant parameters along with their corresponding values. The temperature and relative humidity are commonly measured air properties, highly coupled through nonlinear thermodynamic laws, as the following equation: (5) In which: is the humidity ratio, T is temperature (Kelvin), RH is relative humidity, the atmospheric pressure (KPa), and is the saturation pressure of water vapour (KPa). This thermodynamic equation, which constitutes an equality constraint to the problem of calculating optimized controller setpoints, can be used to convert relative humidity to absolute water content. 2.3. Greenhouse specifications To simulate the GH system, desired setpoints, initial, and climatic conditions must be set. All conditions and parameters used in this study are depicted in Table 1. It is important to mention that the inputs used in the SIMULINK file were derived from external weather data, which was generated to represent various initial and outdoor conditions as follows: initial temperature and outdoor temperature range [−5, 5] °C, initial humidity and outdoor humidity (50%), initial density (200 ), maximum wind speed range [5], [10] , minimum wind speed (1 ), light intensity range [400, 600] , optimal temperature range [18], [25] °C, and relative humidity range [0.4, 0.7]%. Finally, changes in wind speed and light intensity occur every 100 s. This implies that the GH model underwent testing in challenging scenarios that simulated the winter conditions experienced in Tehran city. 2.4. Greenhouse closed-loop modelling PID controllers find extensive use in industrial process control, offering a broad range of applications. Two prevalent approaches for implementing PID controllers are open-loop and closed-loop systems. The open-loop model is less efficient compared to the closed-loop in MIMO systems, causing the response to deviate from the desired reference value and resulting in an error or offset. For further information, readers are encouraged to refer to [29]. Given the highly nonlinear nature of GH, the closed-loop method was chosen for this study. The general mathematical representation of a PID controller, which is typically expressed in the ideal form as shown in Eq. (6) was mentioned [46]. (6) where: is the output control signal at time t; is the proportional gain; is the integral gain; is the derivative gain; is the error between the desired setpoint and the measured process variable at time t; represents the integral of the error over time, and represents the derivative of the error with respect to time. The three actions are multiplied by their respective gain values, and the results are summed together to generate the output control signal. Fig. 2 illustrates the general block diagram of the PID controller for the greenhouse. A closed-loop model for a winter day is constructed using Eqs. (3), (4) and (5), and Fig. 3 shows the block diagram of closed-loop of the GH system. Therefore, the closed-loop can be called a Gray-Box model as represented in the Fig. 4, and the MATLAB/SIMULINK feedback closed-loop model of GH using PID controllers is shown in Fig. 5 Download : Download high-res image (84KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2.

Disturbances: Desired setpoints: Outputs: for one day.

Calculation of optimal monitoring setpoints In this section, the novel proposed monitoring system will be presented. The modelling procedure assumes the setpoints (temperature and relative humidity) are bounded, as will described in the next paragraphs. The primary objective is to find the optimal setpoints of the PID control unit, subject to weather conditions uncertainties. Several cost functions have been suggested as performance criteria for control systems in the literature such as: integral of absolute error (IAE), integral of time multiplied by absolute error (ITAE), integral of squared error (ISE), and integral of time multiplied by squared error (ITSE) [47]. All of these criteria differ according to the type of objective function, which, in turn, is classified as a performance criterion based on the time or frequency domain. However, the efficiency of the PID controllers is defined by the transient response behaviour. The desired response behaviour usually includes the following time domain parameters: rise time ( , overshoot ( ), settling time , the integral error, and the integral of the inputs . The most common cost functions are time-domain integral error performance parameters based on the error signal between the system output and reference setpoints as following: (7) Consequently, optimizing the control system response using the IAE performance criteria can result in responses with relatively small overshoots but long settling times or vice versa [48]. (8) where is the time at which the response reaches steady state. Therefore, the objective function includes the performance parameters to pose it as a minimization problem and the cost function specified in Eq. (8). Additionally, the heater, fog and fan energies can be incorporated into the it to penalize excessive energy utilization in the control signal. Hence, the objective function is given by: (9) However, reducing these time domain parameters (performance parameters) is the goal of designing an efficient controller and equates to improving the response of the signal input. Typically, two key elements – the speed of response and the proximity of the output to the reference (desired) input – can be used to describe the system’s transient response. The rise and peak timings are indicative of how quickly a response occurs, while the maximum overshoot and settling time describe how close the output is to the reference response [49]. The influence of each parameter defined by Eq. (9) is determined by a weighting factor . Each parameter’s variable range and percentage contribution to the overall fitness value are both unknown, as are the ranges over which each parameter can vary. Due to their simplicity, unit step responses are frequently used in the evaluation of control system performance. However, Heaviside functions, also known as step functions, are commonly employed in control systems to model optimal setpoint changes. Their suitability for representing abrupt transitions arises from their discontinuity at zero, enabling them to indicate sudden shifts in a system. Mathematically, Heaviside functions offer simplicity, making them convenient for modelling setpoint changes. Control systems encounter various factors prompting setpoint adjustments, and Heaviside functions effectively capture these changes by specifying the timing or conditions of transition. Additionally, Heaviside functions are closely associated with step response analysis, facilitating the assessment of system stability, performance, and other characteristics in response to setpoint modifications. For more information, readers are encouraged to refer to [50], [51]. Optimal setpoints for operation within the practical range of the GH microclimate was therefore made using the Heaviside function as defined in Eqs. (10) and (11) for the temperature and relative humidity, respectively: (10) (11) By adjusting the magnitude, time, and duration of the step change, can be create various input signals using the Heaviside function to evaluate different aspects of control system performance. It is important to ensure that the chosen constraints are appropriate for the specific control system being evaluated and aligned with the desired performance metrics to be assessed. Therefore, the constraints of Eq. (10) are as follows: and . These constraints are chosen based on the desired temperature setpoints and the time domain parameter of the control system, respectively. On the other hand, the constraints of Eq. (11) are: and . These constraints are chosen based on the desired relative humidity setpoints and the time domain parameter of the control system, respectively. Readers are referred to [52] for more details on the control system performance evaluation. Fig. 6 shows the graphical representation of the Heaviside function for both optimal setpoints. The first plot (a) illustrates the temperature setpoint, in which is the desired temperature setpoint, while the second plot (b) represents humidity setpoint, in which is the desired relative humidity setpoint. The Heaviside Function H(t) take the following general form: (12) In Eqs. (10) and (11) the optimal variables A, B, C, D, E, F, , , , and are determined when the objective function is minimized. The constrained parameters of the Heaviside functions were calculated by the evolutionary algorithm (NSGA-II) and reflect the optimal setpoints for both temperature and relative humidity setpoints. This implies that the optimization problem to be addressed is as follows: For , the optimization algorithm employs Eq. (9) as the objective function for the temperature setpoint. On the other hand, for , the optimization algorithm uses Eq. (9) as the objective function for the relative humidity setpoint.

Monitoring model for an intelligent greenhouse climate The proposed monitoring system consists of two consecutive loops. The first loop is the Guidance Control Unit (GCU) loop and the second is the PID control unit loop (feedback controllers). These two loops make up the configuration of the hierarchical control system. The GCU acts as an optimizer and then uses Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) - a machine-learning approach. The next subsections detailed the mechanism of the proposed system in details. The general block diagram for the intelligent monitoring model for greenhouse climate is presented in Fig. 7. 3.2.1. Optimizer stage The optimizer serves as the first stage in the GCU loop, aiming to optimize two key objectives: temperature and relative humidity, in order to find their optimal setpoints. It then determines the energy reduction corresponding to the optimal setpoints. The optimization process encompasses two stages. Firstly, a single objective optimization (SOO) is performed to optimize each objective individually within the proposed system to validate the new method presented. Secondly, a multi-objective optimization (MOO) is employed to calculate the optimal setpoints for the PID control unit based on two objectives: temperature and relative humidity. In this step, the non-dominating sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) is utilized. By using NSGA-II incorporating the objective function and the performance of PID controllers, the reduction in energy consumption corresponding to the optimal setpoints can be calculated. Finally, the outputs of the GCU are the optimal setpoints to the feedback loop at minimum energy consumption which are: Hence, the GCU serves as the ‘brain’ for the entire system to predict the PID setpoints in real-time according to GH needs. Then, the PID controllers work to minimize tracking errors between computed setpoints (optimized setpoints in the GCU loop) and the output measured in the GH microclimate. In addition, they compensate for disturbances to obtain the desired setpoints for the GH as indicated in Fig. 7. Download : Download high-res image (423KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 7. Intelligent monitoring model for greenhouse microclimate system. 3.2.2. RBFNN stage After completing the optimizer stage and collecting the necessary data, the subsequent stage begins, known as the Artificial Neural Network, specifically RBFNN stage. The targets for training and testing the RBFNN are obtained from the outputs of the optimization and closed-loop (SIMULINK) model. While the inputs of the RBFNN were the same as those of the closed-loop model mentioned before. Once the RBFNN has been trained and tested using this data, it can directly supply the control unit with the optimized setpoints, eliminating the need for the previous optimizer stage. At this point, optimal setpoints for GH climate can be detected regardless of external weather conditions. Therefore, the outputs of the RBFNN serve as the optimized setpoints, which can be utilized by the PID controllers as follows. However, MLPs have played an important role in universal approximation and in the control of nonlinear systems such as GH environments. RBFNNs are structurally simpler than MLPs, making the design process easier and training more efficient. It is strongly based on the function approximation theory and has many advantages that make it highly suited to the current modelling problem. The RBFNN structure consists of three fully connected layers: input, hidden, and output layers as shown in Fig. 8. The input layer connects the network to its environment (sensory units), the validity of this structure has been demonstrated by fulfilling the Stone–Weierstrass theorem [53]. The number of neurons in the input layer is equal to the number of variables to be controlled. The hidden layer applies a non-linear transformation from the input space to the hidden space (feature space) which in general has a higher dimension than the input space. Given two sets of points and and a function such that , the task of the RBFNN is to construct the mapping in such a way that [54], [55]: (13) The output layer applies a linear transformation from the hidden space ( ) to the output space ( ). The Gaussian function ( ), is commonly used in neural network applications as it avoids getting trapped at local minima in the optimization processes involved in control systems. The output, therefore, approaches zero as distance from the centre point approaches infinity [56]. In contrast, the global sigmoid function approaches 1 as the net input goes to infinity. The third layer of the RBFNN is a standard linear layer. The Gaussian function is defined as follows: (14) where is the input vector , is the norm operator, usually Euclidean, is the centre vector of neural network j, is the width vector of Gaussian function indicating where . The weight value is: (15) By this formulation, the network passes through all N data points, creating a strict interpolation (SI) problem (i.e., when measured values are not available). Interpolation is a mathematical technique that estimates intermediate/missing values. RBFNN is commonly used to solve multivariate SI problems by choosing a function f of the form: (16) where n N. and are chosen to minimize the approximation-target distance: (17) Hence, the ideal output of RBF neural network is: (18) The spreads of the neuron activation functions are then determined by the following equation [58]: (19) Download : Download high-res image (165KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 8. Radial basis function (RBFNN) structure [57]. In which: is the maximum distance between neighbouring centres (maximum distance between hidden neuron) and , where n is the number of hidden neurons. This ensures an appropriate degree of overlap between the basic functions. The weights and basis selected in this layer should minimize the sum of square error performance index over the training set. RBFNN should be trained by the data with multi-input and multi-output offline method. In offline learning (batch processing), the weight changes depend on the whole dataset training, defining a global cost function. The RBFNN is trained repeatedly until the cost function is minimized. The gradient descent method is straightforward and easy to implement, but it is highly sensitive to the initial value. When an inappropriate initial value is provided, the initial cost function of the network may be excessively large, leading to a high likelihood of getting stuck in a local minimum during the iteration process. This can severely hamper or render the learning process ineffective. To achieve better outcomes, a combination of the k-means clustering algorithm, recursive least squares (RLS), and gradient descent method is employed. It has been demonstrated that this algorithm, known as “k-means clustering, recursive least squares (RLS)”, which involves training the hidden layer using the k-means method and the output layer using the RLS method, possesses the advantages of computational simplicity and accelerated convergence. As a result, it has become a more practical approach for designing RBFNN. In this study, the k-means clustering method is utilized during the initial iteration to determine the centre and spread of the RBFNN, which then serve as the initial values for the gradient descent method. Since the weight parameter significantly impacts the network’s approximation effectiveness, the RLS algorithm is employed to calculate it in order to avoid getting trapped in local minima during the iterative process. This proceeds by gradient descent to reduce errors and can be used to train reformulated RBFNN. The instantaneous cost function (value of the error energy for neuron) is: (20) where N is the number of training examples, the error signal for the iteration at the output of neuron is . In which t(i) and y(i) are the target and actual outputs for neuron i calculated using the current weights of the network at iteration n as defined in Eq. (17). The new estimate of each weight vector , , is obtained by incrementing its current estimate by an amount as [59], [60]: (21) where is the learning rate, is the error of the output layer defined above. Many statistical indicators can be used to assess model accuracy with smaller values denoting more accurate prediction ability. The mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE) are employed to evaluate the prediction results as shown in the following equations: 1. Mean Absolute Error (MAE): (22) 2. Root mean squared error (RMSE): (23) where are the actual and predicted output values. 4. Results and discussion 4.1. Simulation setup The applicability of the proposed approach is demonstrated and compared to competing approaches such as SOO and RBFNN in terms of setpoints detection and PID performance. The first simulation case has been conducted to show the robustness of the proposed method and the ability of the RBFNN in detecting PID setpoints. To do so, the proposed method based on various values of weather conditions have been applied to the process with varying parameters of the optimization algorithm to generate the necessary data (setpoints). Subsequently, the RBFNN is trained and tested using the target data (setpoints) generated from the preceding step. The pseudocode for the generation of setpoints can be seen in Table 2. The initial parameters, main external disturbances, and setpoints were used in the simulation of GA to produce the design matrix Table 4 are plotted in Fig. 9 and part of them are presented in Table 3. The GA for optimization and the mathematical model of the GH environment were coupled to generate output or the design matrix data. Table 2. Pseudocode of the RBFNN learning. Steps Process 1.

Seventy percent of the design matrix data in Table 4 were used as the target for training the RBFNN, while the remaining 30% were reserved for testing purposes. The RBFNN was characterized by specific attributes, such as utilizing the K-means algorithm for learning, the root mean square error (RMSE) as the objective function, a maximum of 100 iterations, 116 clusters (k), and utilizing a learning rate of 0.02. The RBFNN’s training results showed excellent performance and attained RMSEs on training and testing of 0.19 and 0.11 respectively. The result is plotted in Fig. 10. The first plot (a) demonstrates the RBFNN training, while the second plot (b) shows the performance of the RBFNN in the training phase. In addition, Fig. 11 consists of two plots, the first plot (a) represents the RBFNN test, while the second plot (b) demonstrates the performance of the RBFNN in the test phase.

(a) PID performance after being provided with a temperature setpoint by RBFNN and (b) PID performance after being provided with a relative humidity setpoint by RBFNN.. Fig. 13(a) shows that the machine learning-based optimization phase produced excellent results for temperature setpoint detection. The optimum temperature for the RBFNN (black dashed line) closely matches the optimum temperature for GA (blue solid line). In addition, the delay time is very small (as indicated by the red arrow), however, and there is a delay in responding to the GH temperature, which is understandable given that the large amount of air inside the GH requires some time to warm up during initial operation. Similarly, Fig. 13(b), shows that excellent results were also obtained for the humidity setpoint by significantly reducing overshoot in the system — which is important considering the significance of humidity to plant growth and health. Relative humidity must be contained within acceptable limits to prevent saturated water vapour condensing on cover or crops. The proposed system was therefore verified as effective and the next stage of optimization could commence using the NSGA-II optimization to generate the data with a minimum energy reduction to train and test the RBFNN to find the optimal setpoints for the closed-loop model.

Results of multi-objective optimization and radial basis function neural network (MOO-RBFNN) The proposed system was implemented in a SIMULINK/ MATLAB using NSGA-II to find the optimal setpoints and energy reduction for the GH system. The NSGA-II operators and parameters are presented in Table 6. The initial parameters, main external disturbances, and desired setpoints as depicted in Fig. 9 and Table 3 were used in the simulation process to produce the output or design matrix Table 7. The NSGA-II algorithm and the mathematical model of the GH climate were coupled to generate the output data. The output data in Table 7 were used as a target values to train and test the RBFNN to find the final inputs (optimal setpoints) for the PID control unit. Importantly, the setpoint data in Table 7 produced an average energy reduction, average overshoot reduction, and average improvement of rise time of 25.93%, 10.94%, and 11.29%, respectively, part of it is shown in Table 8. These values were obtained from the energy reduction algorithm, which dealt with the desired and optimal values for each of the heater, fogging, and fan included in the objective function Eq. (9) to find the total energy reduction rate. Finally, the inputs to the PID control unit provided the ultimate goal of reducing the energy consumption of the GH to the lowest possible level. To verify this stage, the RBFNN results must be compared with those of the NSGA-II. These were combined to form the main inputs of the PID control unit. An example simulation case is explained here to show the validity and robustness of the system. In this case, GH model, initial conditions, and climatic conditions were considered the same as those in Table 1. The Pareto front is shown in Fig. 14, and the results show that the two objectives temperature and relative humidity setpoints compete for decision variables. The value of the second objective relative humidity ( ) declines rapidly as the value of the first objective temperature ( ) remains almost unchanged as it approaches point B. However, the second objective ( ) began to change slowly as the first objective ( ) increased approaching point C. This implies that in most cases, the Pareto front from A to C marks the most desirable points. As a result, the two points may offer an acceptable trade-off, and the decision-maker can choose the optimal final answer based on his/her preferences. Table 6. Operators and parameters of NSGA-II.

It is observed from the Fig. 15(a) and (b) that there is no initial overshoot with RBFNN-PID when compared with the NSGA-II -PID and smooth control action is achieved for step time of every 100 s with fast rise time. Here disturbance variables are kept constant and setpoint change is analysed for every 100 samples for a total time of 8000 samples for temperature and 2000 samples for relative humidity. Fig. 15(a) shows the effectiveness of the Heaviside step responses with the PID controller at the temperature response setpoint. The plot shows a good response for the 23 °C indoor air temperature setpoint in terms of no delay time in the response of the system. Likewise, Fig. 15(b) shows a very good response to the relative humidity setpoint at 40%, since the rise time, and the overshoot of the RBFNN is very close to NSGA-II. The difference in errors (RMSEs) between RBFNN and NSGA-II was only 0.0017% demonstrating that both responses show very low steady-state error and have good steady-state performance. Table 9 depicts a comparative study of performance characteristics of the GH model designed with NSGA-II-PID and RBFNN-PID strategies. For any good controller settings, overshoot and rise time should be minimal. Based on the aforementioned analysis, it is advisable to utilize RBFNN-PID for GH monitoring. After undergoing training and testing on data from the previous optimization stage, RBFNN-PID can generate optimal setpoints and effectively reduce energy consumption.

In summary, the intelligent monitoring system proposed in this study, employing the RBFNN stage, demonstrated excellent performance in detecting GH microclimate setpoints, particularly for temperature and relative humidity. This performance was achieved while minimizing energy consumption and improving overshoot and rise times, as evidenced in Table 9. This table calculates the changes in the energy consumption, overshoot, and rise time because the temperature and humidity are very interrelated factors in the GH system. Therefore, it is not wise to separate them when calculating GH efficiency. Moreover, the maximum energy consumption change was 25.88%, while the overshoot and rise time changes were 10.92% and 11.27%, respectively. Finally, the proposed system using RBFNN attained high energy efficiency with an average RMSE of 0.069 and thus fulfilled the objective of this study to find the PID setpoints without manipulating with its parameters ( ) and reducing energy use.

Comparative studies analysis with Fuzzy-PID controllers in literature review This section presents the simulation implementation of the proposed GH model and presents the simulation outcomes. Additionally, a comparison is made between the NSGA-II-PID and RBFNN-PID strategies. To ensure the dependability of our proposed system, we compare our results with those documented in literature [29]. The GH parameters utilized for this analysis are listed in Table 10. The specified active air mixing volume for temperature and humidity is denoted as , which is equal to 0.65 times the total volume. The setpoint changes for the inlet temperature and humidity ratios are varied in steps ranging from 18 to 21 °C and from 16.5 to 19.5 g [H2O] kg−1 respectively. The output is recorded for every sample time of 400 s, and for each setpoint change, a steady-state error is observed. The performance of the Fuzzy-based PID controller is presented in Table 11. Upon examining Table 11, it is evident that the focus of the study was on the change in rise time, which showed a good response. However, in the GH system, the rise time does not play a significant role. Moreover, the fast dynamic response of the GH climate is in contrast to the slower response of crop growth to input changes. Additionally, the study did not account for energy consumption. Table 10. Parameters of greenhouse. Feature Description Greenhouse area Height [4] m Max. fogging system capacity Varies from 1.3 to 26 [H2O] Force ventilation rate Solar irradiation range 300 W/ , reduced to 60% In our study, we achieved a good rise time of 11.27 s and reduced the average overshoot by 10.92% for both temperature and relative humidity. Furthermore, we managed to decrease energy consumption by more than 25% across all measurements. These indicators demonstrate the superiority of our proposed system over the Fuzzy-based PID controller, as reported in Table 9. Another study in our literature aimed to predict energy utilization and temperature setpoints, as mentioned in [32]. The study proposed a robust model predictive control (MPC) framework for temperature control and energy utilization in a semi-closed greenhouse. It compared an artificial neural network (ANN) model with an analytical model and found that the ANN had higher prediction accuracy. Comparisons showed that the robust MPC outperformed them, achieving lower temperature setpoint errors (RMSE) of 0.32 °C in winter. Additionally, it led to energy reductions of 9.67% in winter, demonstrating improved temperature and energy management in uncertain conditions. However, in our study, we present the utilization RBFNN to predict two key GH parameters: temperature and relative humidity. It also incorporates optimization algorithm to calculate energy reduction by determining optimal setpoints. The findings demonstrate a significant energy reduction of over 25% during the winter season. In contrast, the study [32] employed an ANN solely for temperature prediction, resulting in a mere 9.67% reduction in energy usage. Consequently, the RBFNN-based approach in this paper surpasses the ANN-based study in terms of effectiveness. Table 11. Performance analysis of the greenhouse system.

Conclusion This study presented a novel intelligent monitoring model for GH microclimate. This model leading to detection optimal setpoints for the PID controllers’ unit based on two optimization stages by the main unit which is GCU unit. The RBFNN was trained using the output data from the first stage in the GCU unit, where NSGA-II was used to minimize the energy usage in GH climate to a minimum. Therefore, the RBFNN detection mechanism showed a superior ability to provide the desired temperature and relative humidity setpoints under different disturbances, with an RMSE of 0.069. Furthermore, the RBFNN performance was verified by comparing it with the NSGA-II results. The comparison indicated that there was only a very small (0.0017) difference between the two approaches. Importantly, this model approach keeps the energy reduction rate above 25%. In summary, the study shows the ability of the proposed monitoring system to detect the desired temperature and relative humidity setpoints of the GH microclimate through the traditional PID controllers away from manipulating with their basic parameters ( ). Finally, this model can be used for other and more complex systems such industrial buildings and poultry farms when the necessary data is available. Abbreviations Initial of temperature (°C).

The complex agro-hydrological system dynamics, however, often pose challenges in closed-loop control applications. In this work, we propose a two-layer neural network (NN) framework to approximate the dynamics of the agro-hydrological system. To minimize the prediction error, a linear bias correction is added to the proposed model. The model is employed by a model predictive controller with zone tracking (ZMPC), which aims to keep the root zone soil moisture in the target zone while minimizing the total amount of irrigation. The performance of the proposed approximation model framework is shown to be better compared to a benchmark long-short-term-memory model for both open-loop and closed-loop applications. Significant computational cost reduction of the ZMPC is achieved with the proposed framework. To handle the tracking offset caused by the plant-model-mismatch of the proposed NN framework, a shrinking target zone is proposed for the ZMPC. Different hyper-parameters of the shrinking zone in the presence of noise and weather disturbances are investigated, of which the control performance is compared to a ZMPC with a time-invariant target zone. 1 INTRODUCTION Water scarcity is a rapidly escalating global issue due to various factors such as population growth and climate change. Approximately 70% of the freshwater is consumed by agriculture activities.1, 2 Thus, improving the water-use efficiency in the agriculture industry is essential. Currently, practical irrigation policies are mostly open-loop, which are determined based on heuristic or empirical knowledge. Real-time feedback from the field is often not considered. This approach typically has low irrigation efficiency, as the applied irrigation amount can be imprecise, leading to over or insufficient irrigation. Increasing attentions have been drawn to closed-loop irrigation over the past decade.3, 4 Among various approaches, advanced control strategies are popular due to their ability of handling constraints and multiple objectives simultaneously.5-10 In References 5-7, conventional model predictive control (MPC) is employed to optimize the soil-moisture dynamics in real-time in the presence of weather disturbances. Instead of tracking set-point, Mao et al. proposed an MPC controller that tracks a target zone (ZMPC), which provides more degrees of freedom in control actions.8 Long-term irrigation scheduling that aims to optimize crop production over a longer time duration is investigated in References 9 and 10. To be more specific, Nahar et al. proposed a hierarchical framework including a scheduler and a controller.9 The scheduler has a larger sampling time and optimizes over the entire crop growth season. Some soil moisture reference is provided by the scheduler and is tracked by the controller over shorter horizons. Sahoo et al. proposed a knowledge-based scheduler that optimizes the irrigation amount and time explicitly and is shown to be effective under different scenarios.10 One of the major challenges in applying advanced control to the agro-hydrological system is the high computational cost. The water dynamics are often described by the Richards equation, which is a nonlinear PDE developed based on first principles.11 Spatial discretization is often required to simplify the Richards equation in applications,11 however, the resulting nonlinear ODE system is still difficult to solve and leads to states with higher dimensions. Model reduction or approximation techniques are commonly used to reduce the computational complexity of high-dimensional nonlinear models. Model reduction is carried out based on existing models and aims to simplify them. One of the widely used approaches is to project the high dimension original state space onto a lower dimension subspace,12, 13 of which a representative method is the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD).14 However, the physical meanings of the original states are often not preserved by the projection approach, making it difficult to handle state constraints. Data-based model identification methods are often used to approximate complex nonlinear models8, 15-17 with no first-principle knowledge regarding the system required. However, it may be challenging to determine an appropriate model structure, which has a significant impact on the final modeling performance. Furthermore, the computational cost of the identified model might still be significant depending on its structure. For example, in Reference 8 a linear parameter-varying (LPV) model was identified for agro-hydrological dynamics approximation, where computational cost reduction was observed but still not sufficient for real-time online optimizations. Model approximation based on neural networks (NN) is a more generalized approach compared to traditional model identification. In particular, the long short term memory (LSTM) NNs have received rising research interest in dynamic modeling due to their ability to capture the dynamics of a system.18-21 Motivated by the accuracy and computational efficiency of the NN model reduction observed in our previous work22 and inspired by the structure of the LPV model developed in Reference 8, we propose a two-layer NN framework to approximate the agro-hydrological dynamics in this work. The proposed framework is shown to have better open-loop prediction performance compared to a benchmark single LSTM NN. The developed two-layer NN model is employed in a ZMPC controller in the presence of noise and weather disturbances. The control objective is to minimize the amount of irrigation required while keeping the soil moisture content inside the target zone. In order to address the plant-model-mismatch, open-loop bias correction is added to the model, while a shrinking target zone is employed for ZMPC. Two bias correction models are investigated with different updating frequencies and the one with better open-loop prediction performance is used in ZMPC. The shrinking ZMPC target zone is designed such that the shape of the zone can be tuned by modifying the hyper-parameters, of which the effects on the control performance are investigated. The article is organized as follows. The agro-hydrological system of interest is introduced in Section 2. Details of the proposed two-layer NN framework are discussed in Section 6, of which the open-loop validation is provided in Section 10 with two plant-model-mismatch compensation strategies investigated in Section 13. The ZMPC controller employed is introduced in Section 16. The closed-loop simulation results are presented in Section 17. Finally, concluding remarks are provided in Section 23. 2 PRELIMINARIES A schematic of the agro-hydrological system of interest is shown in Figure 1 with grass being the crop of interest. The soil properties are assumed to be homogeneous horizontally and only the soil water dynamics on the vertical axis are considered. Irrigation is applied with a sprinkler and is assumed to reach the soil surface evenly. Precipitation and evapotranspiration are considered as known disturbances based on weather forecasting data with uncertainties. It is assumed that precipitation reaches the soil surface in identical ways as irrigation. FIGURE 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint A schematic diagram of the considered agro-hydrological system. 2.1 Soil water dynamics Based on first principles, the soil water dynamics can be modeled using the 1-dimensional Richards equation with the crop and weather information taken into account:11 (1) where (m) is the capillary potential, (m ) denotes the soil capillary capacity, and (m/s) is the soil hydraulic conductivity. The term captures the effect of the soil type, weather, and crop. To be more specific, represents the dimensionless water stress factor and depends on the soil type, is the dimensionless crop coefficient and is determined by the type of crop considered. (m) denotes the reference evapotranspiration and is assumed to be a known weather-dependent disturbance. m represents the rooting depth of the crop and is assumed to be time-invariant in this work. Note that (m) represents the vertical axis of the soil with upwards as the positive direction. and are modeled by the van Genuchten–Mualem soil hydraulic model:23 (2) (3) where (m/s) denotes the saturated hydraulic conductivity, (m /m ) and (m /m ) represent the saturated and the residual soil moisture, respectively. (m ) and are the van Genuchten–Mualem parameters related to the soil properties. Sandy loam soil is considered in this work and the corresponding parameters are adopted from Reference 24 and are presented in Table 1. TABLE 1. Soil parameters of sandy loamy soil. (m/s) 1.23e-5 (m /m ) 0.41 (m /m ) 0.065 (m ) 7.5 0.88 (m) 3.10e-08 1.89 0.47 2.2 Boundary conditions The boundary conditions employed in this work are presented in (4) and (5). The Neumann boundary condition is used at the soil surface as shown in (4), while free drainage is assumed for the bottom boundary as described in (5). (4) (5) where (m/s) and (m/s) denote the rate of irrigation and precipitation at time . Note that interception caused by grass leaves is ignored in this work, only evapotranspiration, precipitation, and irrigation are considered. 2.3 Model discretization The system of Equation (1) is discretized over the vertical spatial axis following the approach proposed in Reference 11, which leads to an ODE system: (6) where , , and are the state, input, and disturbance vectors, respectively, while defines the nonlinear system dynamics. The total depth of soil considered is 0.5 m and is evenly discretized into 26 nodes. The water dynamics at the center of each node are used to represent the dynamics of the entire node. In this work, irrigation rate (m/s) is the system input, and (m) at the discretized nodes represents the system states. The disturbance are the precipitation rate and the reference evapotranspiration, which are available to the system with bounded uncertainties. The system output is the volumetric water content (m /m ) at the rooting depth , which is an algebraic function of the state vector defined by the soil-water retention equation of van Genuchten (7). Equations (6) and (7) are used to generate all training datasets. (7) 3 PROPOSED TWO-LAYER NEURAL NETWORK To reduce the computational complexity of the first-principle model, a two-layer NN framework is proposed to approximate its nonlinear dynamics. In this section, details regarding the proposed framework will be discussed. Section 6 introduces the motivation and provides an overview of the proposed framework. Sections 7 and 8 discuss the data generation procedure for the individual layers of the framework respectively. 3.1 Overview In this work, LSTM NNs will be used to approximate the original nonlinear system dynamics due to their ability of efficiently handle sequential data.25, 26 Through parameter tuning and various training dataset generation, it was found that a single LSTM that can capture the complex nonlinear dynamics of the agro-hydrological system over the entire operating range of interest is very challenging to obtain. It was noticed, however, within a smaller operating region, a single LSTM provides satisfying modeling performance with significantly reduced tuning difficulty. Detailed simulation results will be presented in Section 10. A schematic diagram of the proposed framework is presented in Figure 2. The first layer contains sub-models, namely Model 1– Model , which will be referred to as in the following text. The second layer consists of a single model (Model A, referred to as ). Each sub-model in the first layer is responsible for a sub-operating region. The union set of the sub-operating regions forms the entire operating region of interest. are LSTMs while is a fully connected NN. At the current time step , take the system input and output obtained from previous time steps as NN inputs: and returns one-step-ahead predictions regarding the system output: Recall that each sub-model is only reliable in a sub-operating region. Inspired by Mao et al.,8 the proposed framework adopts the idea of the LPV models. The model performance can be improved by combining predictions made by multiple sub-models. The one-step-ahead predictions made by are fed to , where the final prediction of the system output at the next time step ( ) is obtained. FIGURE 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint A schematic diagram of the proposed two-layer NN framework. Overall, at any time step , the proposed framework takes as input and returns the one-step-ahead prediction of the system output , which can be expressed as a nonlinear function: (8) Remark 1.The motivation for introducing the second layer NN is to smooth the transition between the sub-models and provide a continuous prediction trajectory of the agro-hydrological system. Continuity of the prediction trajectory is essential for advanced control applications, as most nonlinear optimization solvers use gradient-based algorithms. 3.2 Design and training of first-layer NNs As discussed in the previous section, the first layer of the proposed framework consists of LSTMs. Simulations show that an LSTM can predict the agro-hydrological dynamics well if the difference between the upper and lower bound of the system output to be predicted by the LSTM is less than or equal to 0.15. The overall operating range determined based on the system output is . With the consideration of reserving some overlapping buffer zones between different sub-models, the overall operating region is split into three sub-operating regions, which are presented in Table 2. Three LSTMs are trained individually for the sub-operating regions (i.e., ). The number of LSTM layers employed in the models is also included. Each model consists of 1 or 2 LSTM layers, followed by a fully connected layer. Activation functions “sigmoid” and “tanh” are used. Both activation functions have smooth dynamics, where “tanh” function provides steeper responses compare to “sigmoid” function. Each sub-model is equivalent to a nonlinear function: where the model input is a matrix with 20 rows and 2 columns, and the output is a scalar. 20 is the number of the past input–output data points ( ), while 2 is the number of system input ( ) plus the number of system output ( ). All models have a sampling time of 2 h. TABLE 2. Operating ranges of the sub-models. Operating range # of LSTM layers 1 1 2 Three training datasets that vary in the corresponding operating region are generated for the sub-models respectively. Each dataset contains 30,000 data points. Multi-level pseudorandom input signals are employed to generate all three datasets, which are fed into the discrete ODE system (6) and the Algebraic equation (7) for open-loop simulations. A multi-level pseudorandom signal is similar to a pseudorandom binary signal, except that it has multiple levels, which helps to stimulate the nonlinear dynamics of the agro-hydrological system. More details regarding the design of multi-level pseudorandom inputs can be found in our previous work.22 Figure 3 presents a segment of the training input signal and the corresponding system output for . Note that a random noise signal is added to the output trajectory to mimic real process operations, which is shown in Figure 3B in red. The max magnitude of is defined as follows: where and are the maximum and minimum value of the system output in the dataset. FIGURE 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint A segment of the training dataset of . All datasets need to be reorganized to match the input–output structure of the NNs. Scaling is also required such that the magnitudes of the scaled data are less than 1. All simulations are carried out in Python. TensorFlow27 is used to train the NN models. Readers may refer to our previous work22 for more details regarding data pre-processing and NN training. 3.3 Design and training of second-layer NN The second layer of the proposed framework consists of a fully connected NN equivalent to the following nonlinear function: The inputs to model are the one-step-ahead predictions of the system output made by , , and , while the output is the actual system output prediction. Two fully connected layers with the activation function “sigmoid” are used in . Under the objective of predicting the system output over the entire operating range of interest, the training dataset of covers the entire operating range. A section of the training dataset including 100,000 points is presented in Figure 4, where the input signal and the corresponding output trajectories without and with white noise added are presented. Note that the training dataset of spans all the sub-operating regions with more aggressive dynamics. Instead of continuous irrigation with lower magnitudes, an impulse irrigation signal is used to provide a more aggressive output response that varies in a larger operating range, which is desired for training. FIGURE 4 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint A segment of the training dataset of . Similar to that discussed in the previous section, reconstruction and scaling are necessary for this dataset. Note that the inputs to are not the system input and output. The dataset is passed through the pre-identified sub-models after the data preprocessing. The predictions made by the sub-models are collected, which are the designed inputs for and are used to train . Remark 2.The proposed framework is developed based on the agro-hydrological dynamics specifically and is control-application oriented. The sub-operating regions are determined based on simulations and available knowledge regarding the system of interest. However, the proposed framework provides an approach to capture complex nonlinear dynamics with a combination of aggressive and smooth dynamics simultaneously. It also provides an approach to reduce the computational complexity of advanced control based on LPV models. 4 MODEL VALIDATION The prediction performance of the proposed framework is validated in this section. The maximum number of prediction steps is for this work, which is also the control horizon of interest for following ZMPC applications. Section 10 presents the validation results of the sub-models. The proposed framework is then compared with a single LSTM in Section 11. 4.1 Validation of the first-layer sub-models The multi-step-ahead prediction performances of are presented in this section. Validation datasets are obtained in similar manners as the training datasets with 20% white noise added to the system output. This helps to better test the prediction performance of the models. At any given time step, noise-treated validation data are fed to the model for one-step-ahead prediction. Starting from the second time instant, the prediction made by the model at the previous time instant will be used as the initial condition of the current time instant. This procedure is repeated 20 times, providing twenty-steps-ahead predictions. TABLE 3.

The NRMSE is defined as follows: (9) where is the total number of validation data points, and are the true and predicted system outputs, respectively.

FIGURE 6 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Multi-step-ahead prediction performance of . FIGURE 7 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Multi-step-ahead prediction performance of . All three models provide reasonable multi-step-ahead prediction without delays in the presence of noise. When the magnitude of the system output is low, small prediction offsets can be observed for in Figure 5. Figure 6 shows only some minor offsets exist at the local extremes for . For both and , the effect of noise seems to be minor. For , Figure 7 indicates that the noise has a stronger impact on the single-step-ahead prediction, which deviates and becomes insignificant as the number of prediction steps increases. It is also noticed that when the output converges to steady-states, the impact of the noise is the most significant. Similar to and , also has some minor offsets at the local extremes. For different operating ranges, different system output dynamics are observed. When the soil moisture content and the irrigation rate are low, no obvious steady-state is observed (Figure 5). As the operating range shifts to the higher magnitude side, the soil moisture content tends to saturate to steady-states under continuous irrigation (Figure 7). 4.2 Validation of the proposed two-layer framework The multi-step-ahead prediction performance of the proposed framework is investigated in this section. A single LSTM that aims to predict the agro-hydrological dynamics over the entire operating region is used as the benchmark approximation model. The benchmark LSTM has the same input ( ) and output ( ) structures as the proposed two-layer NN framework, which are discussed in Section 6. The single LSTM has 2 LSTM layers followed by a fully connected output layer. Both the LSTM layers use the activation function “sigmoid” while the output layer uses the activation function “tanh.” Note that the dataset employed for training the benchmark LSTM is the same as that used to train the two-layer NN model. The same validation dataset is used to compare the performance of the two approximation approaches, which spans the entire operating range of interest. The open-loop prediction trajectories of the system output based on the benchmark LSTM and the proposed framework are presented in Figures 8 and 9 respectively. The single-step-ahead, ten-step-ahead, and twenty-step-ahead predictions are presented in each figure with the same line styles as those employed in the previous section. The NRMSE values under the two cases and the percentage difference between them are summarized in Table 4. The percentage difference is calculated with respect to the NRMSE of the benchmark LSTM: As presented in Figure 8, the LSTM can respond to aggressive dynamics efficiently without delays. However, significant offsets are observed at the local extremes with larger magnitudes. A section of the trajectories is amplified, which can be seen on the top-right corner of Figure 8. At both the local maximum and the minimum, significant offsets can be observed in the zoomed-in plot, of which the predicted local minimums are at the level of the true local maximum. Better prediction performance is observed in Figure 9. To be specific, the dynamics at the local minimums can be captured by the proposed two-layer framework much better compared to the LSTM. From the zoomed-in window on the top right, it can be observed that the predictions of the local minimum and maximum are more accurate compared to the LSTM. Table 4 indicates comparison results, showing that the NRMSE values of the proposed framework are significantly lower than those obtained with the LSTM for all different prediction steps. The improvement of the proposed framework is the most significant with one-step-ahead predictions and slowly reduces as the prediction steps increase. FIGURE 8 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Multi-step-ahead prediction performance of an single LSTM. FIGURE 9 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Multi-step-ahead prediction performance of the two-layer NN framework. TABLE 4.

These prediction errors are challenging to eliminate through tuning the hyper-parameters of the NN framework or through modifying the training dataset. To account for the relatively significant plant-model mismatch at local maximums and the effect of disturbance at a lower cost, we introduce a simple bias-and-scale-updated model, of which the details are provided in the following section. 5 PLANT-MODEL-MISMATCH CORRECTION To capture the plant-model-mismatch, two correction approaches are investigated based on the proposed two-layer NN framework. The first approach is to add a simple bias term based on the prediction error: (10) where and represent the actual output measurement and the prediction made by the two-layer NN framework respectively. The second approach is to fit a first order linear model that maps the predicted output to the actual measurement: (11) where and are parameters to be identified. For both approaches, an updating frequency of the parameters needs to be determined first. In this work, we are interested in accurately predicting the system dynamics 20 steps into the future, thus the updating frequency should be a divisor of 20. To test the performance of the two approaches, the validation dataset used in the previous section is employed. The updating policies of the two approaches are presented in Algorithms 1 and 2, respectively. In both algorithms, represents the current time step, denotes the step of predictions made ahead of time , and represents the prediction error at step . At any given time instant , the parameters are first initialized with some initial guess. The initial condition is provided to the proposed framework for multi-step ahead predictions. In the next steps, predictions will be made with the correction model considered, which will be updated every time steps for times. The updating policy of the first approach is to take the average of the accumulated prediction errors over the last prediction steps. For the second approach, a constrained optimization problem that finds the best-fit parameters for the linear model is solved. Note that the parameters are held in bounded compact sets, which help to limit the parameters in a reasonable range. To be more specific, and are used. If a simple linear-regression function is employed, the resulting parameters might be impractical. The toolbox CasADi28 is employed to solve optimization problems in Python. Algorithm 1. Parameter updating algorithm for the first correction approach Algorithm 2. Parameter updating algorithm for the second correction approach Recall the prediction horizon of interest . Thus updating frequencies are tested and compared. The correction performance is measured by the average absolute prediction error : where the same definitions are kept for all variables. The absolute prediction errors of the two correction approaches are summarized in Table 5. The absolute prediction error of just the proposed NN framework is as well included in Table 5 and is used as the comparison benchmark. TABLE 5.

Considering the computational complexity of the two approaches, the single-bias correction with is selected. 6 CONTROLLER DESIGN A ZMPC controller with a shrinking target zone is employed in this work and is presented in this section. The major target here is to provide sufficient irrigation such that the crop can live and grow healthily, which implies the soil moisture content at the crop root zone needs to be kept in a bounded range instead of one particular point. Compared to a conventional tracking MPC, ZMPC provides more degrees of freedom to the system and can handle economic objectives better, which fits the objective of this work. In the basic design of a ZMPC controller, the target zone is kept time-invariant over the control horizon. In this work, we propose a ZMPC design with a time-variant target zone that shrinks over the control horizon to handle plant-model-mismatch. The proposed ZMPC formulation is presented as follows: (12a) (12b) (12c) (12d) (12e) (12f) where , are the system input and output vector, is the zone tracking slack variable. represents the current time step, and denote the system input and output at future time predicted at the current time . Equation (12a) is the objective function, where and are diagonal weighting matrices for the zone tracking objective and the irrigation amount respectively. The control objective is to drive the system into a particular operating zone while minimizing the irrigation amount at the same time. Equation (12b) represents the two-layer NN framework discussed in the previous section, which is used to predict the system dynamics under the selected input trajectory over the control horizon . Equation (12c) defines the initial state at time . Equations (12d)–(12f) are the state, output, and the zone tracking constraints, where , , and are compact sets. The time-variant target zone is a subset of and is defined as follow: (13a) (13b) (13c) where and represent the lower and upper bound of the target zone at time step . The boundaries of the target zone vary over time exponentially from their initial value and until they are converged to the final value and , where . is a non-negative scalar that determines the shrinking speed of the boundaries. Larger leads to more aggressive shrinkage and vice versa. When , the target zone becomes time-invariant (i.e., , ). In this work, and are used. Note that the magnitude of the system input is on the scale of to , which poses numerical issues for solving optimizations problems. Thus is scaled before feeding to the optimization solver. The scaled input takes values between 0 and 1. Unless specified otherwise, , are employed. is used in this work. The sample time of the optimization is 2 h (i.e.,  s), meaning that at a given time instant , the agro-hydrological dynamics in the next 40 h will be optimized ( ). Following the receding horizon control strategy, only the optimal input at the first step will be applied to the system. The optimization problem is solved repeatedly over the horizon of interest , which optimizes the system dynamics over a 5 days duration. Remark 3.The indexes used in the controller (12) and (13) are different from those used in the previous sections. Instead of using index , we introduced and instead. The idea is that the ZMPC is solved at each time instant over the entire simulating horizon of interest, with the dynamics over the next steps being considered in the optimization, of which the steps into the future from time is represented by index . While in previous sections, the time is used for modeling, which represents each time step in the training dataset or the validation dataset. Remark 4.In this work, we enhance the robustness of the closed-loop system by adding the linear plant-model-mismatch correction term in the data-driven modeling and employing zone control in the controller design. Another way to enhance the robustness of control could be to consider modeling and control simultaneously using reinforcement learning approaches.

The same initial condition is employed for all simulations for fair comparisons. To be more specific,  (m) is the initial state at the rooting depth and is employed for the discretized Richards equation, while the corresponding system output (m /m ) is used for the NN models. To initialize the ZMPC simulations based on the proposed framework and the single LSTM, the initial soil moisture content is available and it is assumed that there is no irrigation at the initial step (i.e., ). A matrix with the matching dimension of the designed NN framework input is generated as the initial condition for the NN-based approximation models, with each role of the matrix equal to (i.e., we assume that ahead of the simulation, the system is at a steady state). First, in Section 17, the control performance of the proposed framework is compared with the discretized Richards equation and the single LSTM discussed in previous sections. Simulations are performed under the controller defined by (12) with a time-invariant target zone ( ) in the presence of process and/or measurement noises. Then the performance of the two-layer-NN-based ZMPC with a shrinking target zone in the presence of significant noise and weather disturbance is presented in Section 19. The effects of tuning parameters , , and in ZMPC performance are investigated. The basic ZMPC with a time-invariant target zone is employed as the benchmark controller for performance comparison. 7.1 Optimization performance validation In this section, the performance of the proposed framework in ZMPC applications is validated by comparing the simulation results with those obtained based on the discretized Richards equation and the single LSTM. Table 6 summarizes the average computational time for solving the optimization problem, the economic performance of ZMPC simulations, and the percentage difference in economic performance based on different models. The economic performance is measured by the accumulated irrigation amount in millimeters, which is calculated as follows: where is the irrigation rate at time with the unit m/s. The percentage difference in the accumulated irrigation is calculated with respect to the result obtained based on the Richards equation. The optimal control strategy and the corresponding output trajectories obtained based on different models are presented in Figure 10. The results shown in Table 6 and Figure 10 are obtained in the presence of 2% process noise. Figure 11 presents the optimal system input and output trajectories obtained with 5% process and 5% measurement noise based on the single LSTM and the proposed framework. The colors and markers employed in Figure 11 are the same as those in Figure 10. Table 7 summarizes more ZMPC simulation results based on the single LSTM and the proposed framework in the presence of process and measurement noise. TABLE 6.

Single LSTM 12.1 Two-layer NN 11.2 As presented in Table 6, both the single LSTM and the proposed framework help to reduce the computational cost significantly. The computational cost reduction achieved by the single LSTM is more significant compared to the two-layer NN due to the simplicity of its structure. With only 8.66% deviation, the economic performance of the controller using the two-layer NN is similar to that using the Richards equation, which is significantly better compared to that obtained with the single LSTM. The trajectories in Figure 10 indicate the same, as the optimal control law and the system response of the two-layer NN and the Richards equations are highly overlapped. Based on the Richards equation, no irrigation is applied for the first a few steps and starts to increase slowly over time. The two-layer NN leads to similar control strategy with minor differences caused by the plant-model-mismatch. As for the single LSTM, the irrigation policy is less efficient, which is nonzero over the entire horizon. The output trajectories converge to the lower bound of the target zone for simulations based on the Richards equation and the proposed framework. The responses are reasonable as the economic objective is to reduce the amount of irrigation required. On the other hand, for the single-LSTM-based ZMPC, slower convergence and offsets with respect to the lower bound of the target zone are observed in the optimal output trajectory. From Tables 6 and 7, it is observed that compared to process noise, measurement noise has stronger impacts on the simulation results. As shown in Table 7, except for the case that considered 5% process noise and 5% measurement noise, control with the two-layer NN has significantly better economic performances compared to that using the single LSTM. Compared to Figure 10, the effect of measurement and process noise is more significant in Figure 11, which poses more challenges in control. In Figure 11, the difference between the output trajectory obtained based on the proposed framework and the single LSTM seems insignificant. However, if we compare the corresponding irrigation policies obtained based on the proposed framework and the single LSTM in Figure 11 along with the results in Table 7, it is noticed that the proposed framework tends to have a more sparse control policy (i.e., more time steps with 0 irrigation) and consumes less water overall. On the other hand, the single LSTM poses a non-zero irrigation policy at every time step, which is less efficient. This indicates that the proposed framework performs better in control applications. To summarize, the proposed framework is shown to have better performances compared to the single LSTM in ZMPC applications. However, some minor violations of the target zone are observed at the end of the horizon of interest (Figure 11) due to the effect of noise, which is not ideal as low soil moisture may cause severe consequences in crop growing. Furthermore, precipitation is an essential disturbance in real-world applications and should be considered. In the following section, we investigate the performance of a shrinking target zone in capturing the effect of significant noise and weather disturbances. 7.2 Conventional tracking MPC versus ZMPC We validate the effectiveness of ZMPC for the agro-hydrological system in comparison to conventional tracking MPC in this section. The prediction model employed is the proposed 2-layer NN framework. Precipitation is considered with the assumption that weather forecasting data is available with bounded uncertainties. 5% process noise plus 5% measurement noise are added to the simulations. The conventional tracking MPC is equivalent to a ZMPC with the upper and lower bound of the target zone equal to each other. The tracking target is selected to be the center of the target zone for the proposed ZMPC: Table 8 presents the amount of total irrigation required over the entire horizon of interest based on the ZMPC and tracking MPC. The precipitation data, the optimal control policy obtained based on the two controllers, and the corresponding output trajectories are presented in Figure 12. The results obtained based on the ZMPC are presented in red solid trajectories, while the results obtained based on the MPC are presented in lime dashed trajectories. TABLE 8. Control performance of the proposed ZMPC versus conventional tracking MPC. Controller (mm) % Diff. - Proposed ZMPC 6.16 - Conventional MPC 19.3 214 FIGURE 12 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint The precipitation data (top), optimal control strategies (middle), and corresponding output response (bottom) of the ZMPC and tracking MPC. It can be observed from Figure 12 that the irrigation policy obtained based on the tracking MPC takes much higher irrigation rates and requires irrigation more frequently as the MPC tries to drive the system output to a constant value in the presence of disturbance and noise. This matches with that presented in Table 8, where tracking MPC requires more than 3 times the amount of irrigation compared to that obtained by the ZMPC. Furthermore, it is in general not necessary to maintain the soil moisture content at a precise level to ensure the healthiness of the crops. Thus, compared to conventional tracking MPC, ZMPC is more cost-efficient and fits the control objective for the agro-hydrological system better. 7.3 Shrinking zone versus time-invariant zone In this section, the performance of the proposed shrinking-zone ZMPC and the ZMPC with a time-invariant zone (referred to as the basic ZMPC in the following text) is compared in the presence of 5% measurement noise and weather disturbance. The controller is assumed to have information regarding the weather through weather forecasting with some uncertainties. In this work, we consider a 20% error in weather forecasting. Various parameter combinations are investigated. In Section 19, is kept constant and the effect of and discussed. The opposite is done in Section 20, where and are kept constant with varying . 7.3.1 Tuning and Figure 13 presents two sets of shrinking zones defined with different and . The darker zone bounded by dashed boundaries has , meaning that the target zone shrinks to the center point of the original zone. The lighter zone bounded by dashed-dotted boundaries terminates to a zone with , . For both controllers, is used. The ZMPC results are shown in Figure 14. The results obtained based on the basic ZMPC (i.e., , ) is employed as the performance benchmark. The results obtained based on the two shrinking zone design are presented with the same line style as those used in Figure 13. The economic and zone tracking performance of the ZMPC controllers are summarized in Table 9. The percentage difference of the total amount of irrigation and zone tracking performances is calculated based on the basic ZMPC controller. FIGURE 13 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Shrinking zones with different and .

When precipitation is foreseen, the irrigation amount is reduced. However, minor violation of the target zone at the lower bound is still observed due to the presence of noise. As presented in the figure, the usage of a shrinking zone helps to avoid the violation. Instead of oscillating around the lower bound of the target zone, the output trajectories converge toward the center of the zone. This provides more robustness in the controller in the presence of significant noise. It is also noticed however, the employment of shrinking zones has significantly affect the total amount of irrigation. As summarized in Table 9, the two shrinking zones considered increased the accumulated irrigation amount by 61.0% and 54.9% respectively. Figure 14 and Table 10 indicate that the output responses based on the two shrinking zone designs are very similar, while the design that terminates to a zone performs better economically. Thus, in the following section, we investigate the effect of with , . TABLE 10. ZMPC simulation results with different . Target zone (mm) % Diff. - Zone Viol. (m /m ) % Diff. - Zone Viol. Time Inv.

The second largest zone bounded by dotted lines has , while the largest zone with solid boundaries has . The shrinking process becomes less aggressive as decrease. Figure 16 shows the optimal control strategies and the corresponding output responses of the three ZMPC controllers. The same line styles as those used in Figure 15 are used in Figure 16. The total irrigation consumption of the three controllers is summarized in Table 10, where the result obtained with the basic ZMPC is again presented as the performance benchmark for consistency. FIGURE 15 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Shrinking zones with different . FIGURE 16 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint The optimal control strategies (top), and corresponding output response (bottom) of ZMPC with different . From Figure 16, it is observed that as the magnitude of decreases, the output response shifts towards the lower bound of the original target zone. The target zone violation thus becomes more significant, which is consistent with the results presented in Table 10. It is also noticed that with reducing value, the total irrigation consumption reduces. In summary, in the presence of noise and disturbances, a trade off exists between the amount of irrigation applied and the zone-tracking performance. Depending on the priority of the control objectives, parameters can be tuned accordingly. If some slight zone violation is allowed, a time-invariant target zone or a shrinking zone with smaller and greater difference between and can be employed for better economic performance. Vice versa, a shrinking zone that shrinks more significantly over the control horizon (i.e., larger and narrower terminating zone) can be used if the zone-tracking objective is superior compared to the economic performance. 8 CONCLUSIONS A two-layer NN framework is proposed in this work to approximate the agro-hydrological system of interest, which is shown to be superior to a single LSTM for both open-loop prediction and closed-loop control applications. Based on the two-layer NN model, a ZMPC strategy is proposed to maintain the soil moisture content at the root zone within a certain zone. To handle the effect of noise and weather disturbance, a target zone that shrinks along the control horizon is employed in the controller. The effect of different shrinking rates and widths of the terminal zone are discussed. Through simulations, it is noticed that steeper shrinking zones help to reduce the zone violation while significantly increasing the amount of irrigation required. Mild shrinkage in the target zone leads to lower economic costs but also minor zone violations. Depending on the priority of the control objective, the hyper-parameters can be tuned accordingly.

  Explanation: This paper proposes an optimal control method for real-time irrigation scheduling that aims to improve water use efficiency and crop yield. The proposed approach utilizes a two-level feedback control strategy, where the seasonal irrigation planner determines the optimal distribution of water over the fields and growth stages of the crop for the entire growth season, while the daily irrigation controller regulates a target soil moisture zone subject to the (seasonal) irrigation constraints set by the seasonal irrigation planner and operational constraints.

In this work, we propose optimization-based feedback control to improve crop yield and water productivity in agriculture irrigation for a plantation consisting of multiple fields. The interaction between soil, water, crop (sugarcane in this work), and the atmosphere is characterized by an agrohydrological model using the crop water productivity modeling software AquaCrop-OS. To optimally distribute water over the fields, we propose a two-level optimal control approach. In this approach, the seasonal irrigation planner determines the optimal allocation of water over the fields for the entire growth season to maximize the crop yield, by considering an approximation of the crop productivity function. In addition, the model predictive controller takes care of the daily regulation of the soil moisture, respecting the water distribution decided on by the seasonal planner. To reduce the computational complexity of the daily controller, a mixed-logic dynamical model is identified based on the AquaCrop-OS model. This dynamical model incorporates saturation dynamics explicitly to improve model quality. To further improve performance, we create an evapotranspiration model by considering the expected development of the crop over the season using remote-sensing-based measurements of the canopy cover. The performance of the two-level approach is evaluated through a closed-loop simulation in AquaCrop-OS of a real sugarcane plantation in Mozambique. Our optimal control approach boosts water productivity by up to 30% compared to local heuristics and can respect water use constraints that arise in times of drought. Key Points A two-level optimization method is proposed that is tailored to solve the optimal irrigation problem of a large-scale plantation AquaCrop-OS is used to model the agrohydrological system using real data and to simulate a plantation consisting of multiple fields The proposed optimization method produces optimal irrigation schedules in periods of drought and maximizes water productivity 1 Introduction Global water demands are projected to increase by 20% to 30% by 2050 compared to 2010 levels, due to population growth and emerging economies (Burek et al., 2016). Agriculture is the largest global consumer of the available water resources, accounting for 69% of annual water withdrawals (IEA (International Energy Agency), 2016). Therefore, a pivotal step in addressing the alarming water scarcity problem is improving irrigation efficiency in agriculture. Conventionally, irrigation operates under open-loop conditions, making use of heuristics or empirical data. These traditional approaches miss out on real-time feedback information from the fields, such as evapotranspiration rates and soil moisture measurements. As a result, open-loop irrigation methods are often unable to irrigate with precision, leading to overirrigation. With increasing interest to achieve precision irrigation, model predictive control (MPC) has been explored in the past decade as an optimal feedback control method. In MPC, the evolution of a system (e.g., the crop field) is predicted using a model, subject to the control inputs (e.g., amount and timing of irrigation). These control inputs are then optimized with respect to the desired trajectory of the system states that would optimize some performance (e.g., maximize crop yield or minimize water use). The control inputs corresponding to the first time step are implemented and for the next time step the optimization procedure is repeated using newly obtained measurements and state estimates. Park et al. (2009) used MPC to maintain the soil moisture and salt levels of a field below a desired threshold. McCarthy et al. (2014) divided a heterogeneous field in zones based on spatial and temporal differences and used MPC to optimize irrigation. An MPC framework was developed in Saleem et al. (2013) using a water balance model for real-time irrigation scheduling to minimize the root zone soil moisture deficit and the amount of irrigation. Delgoda et al. (2016) identified a linear model based on the crop water productivity model AquaCrop using a water balance and used MPC to minimize the root zone soil moisture deficit, with a limit on the water supply. Mao et al. (2018) approximated a nonlinear agrohydrological model with a linear parameter varying model and used MPC to maintain the soil moisture within a desired target zone. The typical objective of the aforementioned studies is to maintain the soil moisture of a single field at a desired set point or within a target zone using hourly or daily time steps. However, the aforementioned methods do not relate water stress to yield, which is the main performance indicator for any crop in the real setting. Furthermore, water use should also be considered over the entire growth season (a priori preferably because farmers need to be able to plan ahead), not just from day to day as water resources are often limited and droughts are becoming increasingly common. This issue has been addressed in feedforward approaches (e.g., Dudley et al., 1971; Georgiou & Papamichail, 2008; Protopapas & Georgakakos, 1990; Wardlaw & Barnes, 1999) that schedule irrigation over entire growth seasons. However, the main shortcoming of these later methods is that they miss out on real-time feedback information from the fields to help decide where and when to allocate the water. Recently, to optimize water allocation on both a daily and seasonal temporal scale, Nahar et al. (2019) have proposed a hierarchical feedback approach to maximize yield over an entire growth season. A top-level scheduler calculates a target soil moisture value for each remaining day in the growth season for a single field and a lower-level controller follows the target soil moisture. Then, the proposed closed-loop scheduling approach is compared to open-loop scheduling over a full season (by crop yield and water consumption). However, the authors were unable to show significant difference between the two approaches. In this paper, unlike in the papers discussed above, we consider the more general problem of optimal soil moisture control of multiple fields (e.g., a plantation) for a full growth season. Here we consider allocating water optimally over the growth season with daily irrigation control for multiple fields, while considering water availability changes throughout the season. This adds complexity to the control problem, as operational constraints need to be included (such as a limited number of fields that can be irrigated in a day) and trade-offs need to be made between irrigation and crop yield of the different fields. Furthermore, the growth stages of the fields can be different, as often not all fields can be planted and harvested at the same time. We propose a novel two-level feedback control approach for the water distribution of an entire plantation, in order to improve the water use efficiency and yield. A process schematic of the proposed two-level control approach is depicted in Figure 1. The seasonal irrigation planner determines the optimal distribution of irrigation water over the fields and growth stages of the crop for the entire growth season, in order to maximize the crop yield under scarce water conditions. We could also maximize economic return from the water. However, in this work we consider a plantation that has the same crop on all fields and so maximizing yield is the same as maximizing economic return. The daily irrigation controller uses MPC to regulate a target soil moisture zone subject to the (seasonal) irrigation constraints set by the seasonal irrigation planner and operational constraints. In our framework, we apply MPC in a receding horizon implementation, where the input sequence that yields an optimal predicted output while simultaneously satisfying all the constraints is computed using predicted weather conditions. Receding horizon control accomplishes feedback against uncertain disturbances by applying only part of the computed input sequence (here for 1 day) and then updating the system states using new information (e.g., deviations in temperature and precipitation) and recomputing the next optimal sequence a day later. As the prediction horizon slides along, this process of state updates using measurements, prediction and control optimization is repeated. This process is generally inherently robust to a small amount of uncertainty (Mayne et al., 2000), and good closed-loop performance can be expected in this application if the water availability and plant water demand do not change drastically. To validate our method we model a real sugarcane plantation from Mozambique in AquaCrop-OS (Foster et al., 2017) (the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations [FAO] standard for simulating the crop yield response when water is a key limiting factor in crop production) and evaluate the performance of our two-level optimization algorithm using closed-loop simulations in AquaCrop-OS. Figure 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Process diagram for the proposed two-level optimization approach for precision irrigation. The seasonal irrigation planner first calculates the water amount that each field can use during each growth stage; the daily model predictive controller then regulates the soil moisture using irrigation control while respecting the water amount that the seasonal irrigation planner imposed. Note that if the water availability changes during the season the seasonal irrigation planner can reevaluate the water distribution. This paper is organized as follows: In section 2, we model the (1) agrohydrological system using a simple water balance from literature, which we expand on by including a novel mixed-logic saturation model; (2) evapotranspiration process by assimilating case study specific crop growth data and atmospheric parameters; (3) effect of water stress on crop growth using piecewise linear approximations of a crop yield model for sugarcane. We complete the section with an exposition of the complete optimization problem and our proposed two-level optimization method that is used to solve it. In section 14, our proposed models are identified and validated on an AquaCrop-OS simulation model of a real sugarcane plantation in Mozambique. In section 17, we evaluate the performance of our two-level optimization method by conducting three closed-loop simulations using AquaCrop-OS involving (1) the effect of decreasing water use on crop yield, (2) comparing the water productivity of our proposed approach with the plantation's approach of irrigation every 3–4 days to field capacity, and (3) assessment of the performance of our proposed approach under water scarcity. Section 22 summarizes some conclusions and further research required to realize an implementation of the proposed approach in the real irrigation system. 2 Modeling and Optimal Control The objective of precision irrigation is to maximize the yield and water efficiency by irrigating the fields with an adequate amount of water at the most suitable time instants. Therefore, the crop yield is maximized by minimizing the amount of water stress the crop is exposed to. This water stress occurs when not enough water is available in the root zone of the soil for the crop to absorb with its roots. Therefore, in order to minimize the water stress, a model of the agrohydrological system is needed that characterizes the interaction between soil moisture, the crop and the atmosphere. Furthermore, the effect of the water stress on the yield needs to be quantified per growth stage, such that irrigation is prioritized in the water sensitive stages. This is achieved by considering a simplification of the yield prediction function proposed in Raes et al. (2006). Finally, the irrigation of the fields is constrained by operational limitations, such as water availability or availability of human operators and/or machinery such as sprinklers. 2.1 Agrohydrological Modeling Here we consider a plantation with multiple fields, where each field j is characterized by a field-specific agrohydrological dynamical system. A schematic of this agrohydrological model for a single field is shown in Figure 2, together with water fluxes at the boundaries of the root zone. In the agrohydrological system, water transportation takes place by means of rainfall, drainage, evaporation, transpiration, and irrigation. Here, soil homogeneity for each individual field is assumed, that is, a field is modeled using a single soil layer, and a simplified water balance approach (Delgoda et al., 2016; Jensen et al., 1971) is used for irrigation control. This simplified water balance approach is selected over more complex modeling approaches like those of Mao et al. (2018) for computational feasibility reasons, as the complexity of the scheduling problem will grow exponentially with the number of fields in the later. Furthermore, the system will operate using a daily time step, for which the dynamics are more easily captured in a simple water balance. A crop experiences water stress when the potential energy of the soil water limits the availability of water extraction by the plants roots, that is, the total available water (TAW) in Figure 2 drops below the water stress threshold. This water stress threshold depends on the crop type and the evaporation power of the atmosphere. The water stress is expressed by the Root Zone Depletion (RZD) (Allen et al., 1998), which is the combined amount of rain and irrigation needed to bring the soil moisture content of the root zone back to field capacity. A negative RZD indicates excess water, which will be drained away from the field over time. Let the variable D represent the RZD of a field; then its dynamics can be given as follows (Allen et al., 1998): (1) where D(k) is the RZD at the end of day k, E∗(k) is the total crop evapotranspiration for the day, Pe(k) the effective rainfall (i.e., the rainfall reaching the soil after interception by the canopy), I(k) the irrigation depth, G(k) the deep percolation (drainage), R(k) the runoff, and k the time step in days. The groundwater tables of the fields we consider here are low; therefore, the contribution of capillary rise is considered negligible. Note that for notational convenience, we omit the field index j from the equations here. Furthermore, the variables from Equation 1 are all expressed in millimeters by normalizing over the surface area. Figure 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Basic water balance model (adapted from Allen et al., 1998, Figure 43), RAW and TAW stand for readily and total available water to the plant, respectively. The RZD indicates the required water amount to bring the soil moisture content back to field capacity. 2.1.1 A Mixed-Logic Saturation Model The RZD is, as the name implies, dependent on the root zone depth (Zr) of the plant during its growth: (2) where θFC is the volumetric soil water content at field capacity and θ(k) the soil water content at end of day k, expressed in mm3/mm3. Following heavy rain or irrigation, the RZD might exceed the field capacity (D(k) < 0). Depending on the hydrological parameters of the soil this excess water will drain over multiple days (Raes et al., 2006, 2018). However, for reasons of simplicity, we assume all fields are well drained and that the soil moisture content is back to field capacity at the end of the first day of free drainage. Note that for soils that are not well drained the deep percolating of the excess water may take longer than 1 day. However, we assume that for the majority of the days that the fields are operated the soils are unsaturated. Furthermore, in a closed-loop system with frequent measurements the soil moisture estimation errors introduced by this saturation modeling error are small. When the soil becomes saturated, it cannot hold any more water and the remaining irrigation or rainfall can be considered as surface runoff. However, any excess water is assumed drained in 1 day, so saturation never occurs and . Consequently, we rewrite Equation 1 to obtain the following agrohydrological model: (3) The conditionally switched depletion dynamics in Equation 3 can be converted into a set of linear dynamic equations and linear inequalities involving real and integer variables called a mixed-logic dynamical (MLD) model (Bemporad & Morari, 1999). 2.1.2 Remote Sensing Data-Based Evapotranspiration Model Evapotranspiration is the largest contributor to consumptive water use by crops in the agrohydrological cycle. Therefore, it is the main driver for irrigation and it should be estimated accurately to achieve precision irrigation. Using the Pennman-Monteith method (Allen et al., 1998) or the Priestley-Taylor equation (Priestley & Taylor, 1972), a reference evapotranspiration can be calculated that can then be adjusted with growth stage dependent coefficients for each crop type to estimate the actual evapotranspiration of a crop. In recent years, the application of remote sensing data for agricultural decision making has been researched extensively (e.g., Champagne et al., 2010; Estes et al., 1978; Martens et al., 2017; Mulla, 2013). A particularly promising remote-sensing-based vegetation index is the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), which measures reflectance of the near-infrared and red range of the light spectrum. Vegetation can be particularly well measured using NDVI as plants contain varying amounts of chlorophyll that reflect the light in a distinct way. As a result, NDVI is strongly correlated with physiological processes like evapotranspiration (Kamble et al., 2013; Trout et al., 2008) and biomass (Goswami et al., 2015). In Zhang et al. (2015), evaporation for sugarcane in Hawaii is estimated using NDVI measurements. The NDVI values are used to estimate the canopy cover using linear regression and subsequently the canopy cover is used to estimate evapotranspiration using another set of linear regression models. This motivates using NDVI directly to obtain estimates of the crop evapotranspiration. For scheduling irrigation, we propose a new approach to model evapotranspiration that uses NDVI data as a surrogate for canopy size (as directly measuring canopy size for a large-scale plantation is infeasible) to indicate the expected progress of crop growth in a typical growth season. The evapotranspiration is partitioned into (soil) evaporation and transpiration. The evaporation largely depends on the area of the soil covered by the canopy, that is, when the canopy size increases a smaller fraction of the soil is exposed to the Sun and the evaporation will decrease. Conversely, when the canopy size increases the transpiration will increase as a larger canopy will generally consume more water. Therefore, an NDVI-based canopy size curve estimate can be used as a measure of the increasing transpiration levels over the season and also the corresponding fraction of water lost as evaporation, which decreases over the season. Creating an estimate of this expected crop growth in a growth season requires an NDVI data set, weather data, and planting and harvest dates from at least one past growth season of the fields. However, the growth of a crop depends heavily on the crop varieties, water stress, application of fertilizer, and soil type. Therefore, for a plantation, we assume that the group of fields used in the method grow the same crop with similar characteristics; this method can be repeated for each group of fields in a plantation to obtain accurate evapotranspiration estimates. In applications where small holder farmers are involved, this assumption may not be true and evapotranspiration models for each crop type could be aggregated. The first step of the method is to model the effect of seasonal air temperature changes on the different growth seasons. By incorporating the evolution of temperature over time, we correct for the effect of temperature on the crop development over the growing cycle. This is necessary because the planting and harvest dates describing each growth season can be different for each field, often due to logistical reasons, such as number of harvesting/planting machines available, human operator availability, and water availability. Using the planting date and air temperature data, the NDVI data points are linked to heat units, expressed in Growing Degree Days (GDD), to describe crop development (in °C day−1). In this approach, the time required to reach a particular growth stage is expressed in Cumulative GDD (CGDD) instead of number of days. Here we use the method from McMaster and Wilhelm (1997), a popular approach from among many methods, where both maximum and minimum temperatures are bounded before calculating the CGDD: (4) where the base temperature Tbase is the lower bound below which crop development halts. The average temperature Tavg is calculated using (5) (6) (7) where Tmax(k) and Tmin(k) are the maximum and minimum air temperature, respectively, and and are the maximum and minimum air temperature adjusted for the upper and lower thresholds that limit crop development. The upper threshold temperature Tupper indicates the upper bound on air temperature above which crop development no longer increases and Tbase is the temperature below which growth does not progress. The second step, involves fitting a curve, fNDVI, through the NDVI-CGDD points of all growth seasons of all fields that represents the expected evolution of the crop size over the season. Note that the type of curve appropriate to use depends on the quality and quantity of the data. The obtained curve describes the expected canopy size over the growth season as a function of the amount of “warmth” that the crops have experienced since planting. As a final step, evapotranspiration is split into an evaporation and a transpiration part. The evolution of both the transpiration and evaporation is described by the evolution of the canopy size captured by our NDVI-based curve. However, with an increase in the canopy size the transpiration increases and the evaporation decreases. Let (a new counter) denote the CGDD of the crop at the end of day k: (8) where k0 is the planting day of the field. Then, the evolution of the evaporation, fevap, can be described as a function of the curve fNDVI: (9) where (10) Consequently, the evaporation contribution to the evapotranspiration is assumed to be negligible when the canopy is fully grown. If this is not the case, a value higher than can be chosen to increase the value of fevap( ) in full grown canopy conditions. For the transpiration we can directly use the NDVI-based growth curve. Finally, the curves describing the evolution of the transpiration and evaporation over the growth season are used to estimate the evapotranspiration ( ) of the crop over the growth season: (11) where α1, α2, and α3 are coefficients that are estimated through linear least squares using the historic data of the reference evapotranspiration Eref( ). Furthermore, the linear term α3 corrects for the linear dynamics in evapotranspiration as a function of the season, which is not captured by the transpiration and evaporation curves. Note that temperature predictions are needed to estimate , which then allows to predict future evapotranspiration values using Equation 11. Furthermore, the reference evapotranspiration Eref( ) is the same for all fields, as we assume the fields are located in the same geographically small (i.e., same climate) area. 2.2 Crop Yield Model 2.2.1 Defining Water Stress The amount of water available to the crop is the difference between the permanent wilting point (minimal amount of soil water required for the plant not to wilt) and the field capacity. However, when the soil water content drops below the water stress threshold (see Figure 2), the roots cannot uptake water quickly enough to respond to the water demand and the crop starts experiencing stress. Furthermore, the deeper the roots the bigger the soil column from which the plant can draw water. Therefore, the point at which the crop starts experiencing water stress can be expressed as a function of the effective rooting depth: (12) where p ∈ [0, 1] is the fraction of the TAW below which the crop experiences water stress, θFC is the soil moisture content as a fraction of the field capacity, and θWP is the soil moisture content as a fraction of the wilting point. The roots are initially established at a small depth when the crops are first planted and gradually grow to the maximum depth. However, if the soil becomes too wet (D(k) < 0) the crop also starts experiencing water stress, due to anaerobic conditions and water logging. Therefore, we define the target zone in which the crop experiences no water stress as (13) The lower bound is enforced by the assumed rapid drainage, that is, D(k) ≥ 0 ∀k. To track the violation Dv(k) of the upper bound of the target zone, a performance constraint is introduced: (14) where ϵ(k) ∈ [0, p(θFC − θWP)Zr(k)] is a virtual state with the same bounds as D(k) in Equation 13. Note that when D(k) does not violate the target zone, we have , resulting in . This is true because we are solving a linear problem. Then, by penalizing the value of Dv(k), the violation of the upper bound of the target zone is minimized. 2.2.2 Modeling the Effect of Water Stress on Yield The effect of violating the target soil water content, that is, water stress, on the yield depends on both the reduction in the evapotranspiration (i.e., the level of water deficit) and the growth stage. As in the literature and standard FAO of the United Nations approaches (Steduto et al., 2012), we model the response of yield to water stress using sensitivity indices λℓ for each growth stage ℓ. These sensitivity indices, together with the potential water use Wp, ℓ and actual water use Wa, ℓ, specify the effect of water stress on yield decline in each growth stage (Doorenbos & Kassam, 1979): (15) where is the relative yield, the left-hand side is the relative decrease in yield, and denotes the fraction of reduction in water available to the crop in growth stage ℓ compared to the potential water use, that is, is the total crop water use without stress or other limiting factors. This Wp, ℓ value can be estimated using the evapotranspiration estimate derived in section 3: (16) where is a subset of days in the growth season during which the crop is in growth stage ℓ ∈ {1, … , Ngs}, where Ngs denotes the number of growth stages. Assuming optimal agronomic practice, the actual water use is equal to the potential water use when the soil moisture is in the target zone. However, when the tolerable depletion exceeds the threshold (Dv(k) > 0), the crop experiences water stress and the actual water use is diminished: (17) The effect of RZD on E∗( ) can be modeled by introducing a water stress factor Ks( ) (Allen et al., 1998): (18) where (19) We assume that under feedback control the soil moisture content will not be allowed to drop below the wilting point; therefore, the water stress factor can be reduced to (20) Next, by substituting Equations 16-20 in Equation 15, we can express the yield as a function of the root zone water dynamics: (21) Over the growth season, the sequence of relative yield decreases in each stage are multiplied to compute the overall yield decrease (Hanks, 1974; Jensen, 1968). This however results in a high-order (i.e., order equal to number of growth stages) nonlinear function with multiplicative terms between all variables. Therefore, the overall yield is often approximated using a first-order (i.e., additive) compounding function (Bras & Cordova, 1981; Stewart et al., 1977), which we use for the MPC controller as the multiplicative approach is not computationally feasible. Although the additive approach is used to formulate our yield maximizing objective functions, the performance of the MPC controllers are tested using the multiplicative formula in closed-loop simulations with AquaCrop-OS. Note that for the seasonal irrigation planner, the multiplicative compounding function is approximated by a piecewise function, see section 8. Consequently, the performance criterion of the MPC controller is expressed as follows: (22) The only variable in Equation 22 that we can manipulate is Dv(k) by controlling the amount of irrigation. The other variables can all be calculated or predicted before each optimization iteration of the MPC problem. Therefore, the water stress cost (Jws) to minimize in order to maximize the yield can be expressed as follows: (23) where wℓ( ) is the weight on water stress in growth stage ℓ: (24) The evapotranspiration of each growth stage can be predicted a priori for the entire growth season using historic data, predictions of the temperature, and Equation 11. Furthermore, estimates of the crop sensitivity indices can be obtained from literature (see Allen et al., 1998) or can be estimated using a crop model analysis. Moreover, estimates of the root depth can be obtained from field measurements or literature. Therefore, the weights wℓ can be calculated a priori for the current growth season. Moreover, note that the framework presented in this work is flexible in choosing sensitivity indices: any number of growth stages can be defined. The crop yield will be maximized over a finite prediction horizon with length Np using a rolling horizon approach (Camacho & Bordons, 1995), that is, MPC. For computational reasons, the prediction horizon will likely not cover the entire growth season. Therefore, we rewrite Equation 23 to (25) where is a subset of days in the prediction horizon during which the crop is in growth stage ℓ ∈ {1, … , Ngs}. 2.3 Optimal Irrigation Allocation Over Growth Stages Anticipating droughts, local water authorities often limit the amount of water that each farmer can use for irrigation in the upcoming growth season or year. However, how to allocate this water over the fields and the growth stages to maximize profit or yield is nontrivial. The allocation does not only depend on maximization of the yield but also costs such as the fixed costs of planting (or not planting), costs of fertilizer use, and costs of required machinery for irrigation. However, all these costs can simply be included as objectives in the optimization problem, emphasizing the generality of our modeling approach. For the purpose of this work, we only consider the allocation of the available water over all fields to maximize the yield, such that no crops die. This optimal water allocation optimization is performed by the seasonal irrigation planner, before the growth season starts, as the management of the plantation will have to plan ahead the allocation of other resources such as machines and labor. Although the water availability throughout the season could change, in this work we assume that the water availability is known before and will not change (as it is agreed upon in the yearly contract with the local water authority). However, in our formulation we keep track of how much water was applied in past growth stages of each of the fields and their current progress in the season. Therefore, the seasonal irrigation planner can be used to redistribute the water throughout the season given the new water availability constraints. To model the effect of water deficit and stress on yield as accurately as possible, the multiplicative compounding function is used to plan water allocation for a growth season. Let denote the set of fields and let be the estimate of the potential water use in growth stage ℓ of field . Then, the total yield Ytot of a plantation for a growth season is described by the summation of crop yields computed by the multiplicative compounding function: (26) where Aj is the surface area of field j, Yp the potential yield per area (which is assumed the same for each field), and Wa, ℓ, j is the actual water use of field j in growth stage ℓ. Furthermore, the total water use over the growth season is (27) Then, if the plantation is assigned an amount of water Wmax for the growth season, the optimal water allocation problem can be defined as (28a) (28b) (28c) where Tℓ ∈ [0, 1] is the minimum relative water use of each growth stage below which the crop suffers terminal moisture stress and dies ( ). Note that the optimization problem is nonlinear and nonconvex, due to the multiplicative compounding function. Furthermore, the constraint needs to be satisfied for the problem to be feasible. A crop kite is a tool that visualizes the space of possible yields and actual water uses when considering the effect the temporal distribution of water use has on the yield (Smilovic et al., 2016). The solutions to the optimization problem from Equation 28a define the upper bound of the crop kite, see Figure 3. The crop is essentially a convex set that indicates how much effect the temporal water use distribution can have on the yield. For example, when only 70% of the potential water use is available the resulting yield can be anywhere from 22% to 55% of the potential yield, depending on how the water is allocated across the growth stages in the growth season. Figure 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint In green the crop kite of sugarcane, using crop sensitivity values from Table 1 and . The red crosses and lines represent a piecewise affine approximation of the upper bound of the crop kite using Equation 32. The optimization problem from Equation (28a) is nonconvex and the difficulty of solving it scales exponentially with the number of fields. Therefore, we approximate it to render our seasonal irrigation planner computationally feasible. First, consider the alternative problem formulation in which we have to allocate water to one growth stage ℓ until , then where to allocate the remaining water to another growth stage, and so on. This alternative optimization problem is a scheduling problem: What is the best order of growth stages to allocate the available water to in order to maximize the yield? To answer this question, consider the contribution values cℓ of each growth stage ℓ per water unit to the yield: (29) The ranking of the cℓ values determines the solution to our alternative problem: each growth stage receives the minimum required amount of irrigation for the crop not to die (feasibility requirement for a solution to this problem), then the growth stage with highest contribution cℓ receives water up to potential water use (or however much water is available), then the remaining water is allocated to the growth stage with second highest contribution value, and so on. Let be the set of growth stages with a contribution value ci or higher and be the set of growth stages with a contribution value lower than ci, where i ∈ {1, … , Ngs}. Then, the upper bound of the crop kite is approximated by a set of points (one for each growth stage). Each of the points consists of a relative yield coordinate (Yi) and a relative water use coordinate (Wi): (30) (31) These points can be calculated a priori for each growth season and are connected with straight lines (as we increase water use for one growth stage at a time) to form a piecewise affine approximation of the upper bound of the crop kite: (32) This piecewise affine approximation of the upper bound of the crop kite can be calculated for all fields using the potential water use predictions. Furthermore, by using binary variables to model the switching behavior, Equation 32 can be converted to an MLD system following the method of Bemporad and Morari (1999). Then, denote by the expected yield of field j using the MLD reformulation of Equation 32. Consequently, the nonlinear, nonconvex optimization problem from Equation 28a can be reduced to an mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem: (33a) (33b) (33c) which can be efficiently solved using state-of-the-art MILP solvers such as CPLEX or Gurobi. The solution can then be used to constrain the water use of each growth stage for each field, in order to maximize the total yield with the available water. To illustrate the performance of the piecewise approximation, the upper bound is approximated for the crop kite depicted in Figure 3, see the red curve and crosses. Because of the nonlinearity of the multiplicative compounding function the contribution values actually change as water is allocated to growth stages. However, in the approximation we assumed fixed contribution values (i.e., average contribution per unit of water). This assumption introduces errors when the contribution values are similar, as then the available water should be divided between the competing growth stages for optimality. This is actually the case for the third and fourth growth stages of the example in Figure 3. Here, the contribution values of the third and fourth growth stage are 0.2026 and 0.2208, respectively. However, the approximation is still good in this case, as the estimation error is small. As a future improvement the water could be split between growth stages that have similar contribution values to reduce the error, for example: If the contribution values are within a tolerance of 0.05, the remaining water is divided half-half between the two growth stages. 2.4 Operational Constraints The feasibility of the calculated daily irrigation schedules depends on the local operational constraints of the plantation. These constraints can be divided in two groups: Resource constraints: These constraints indicate a limitation in the availability of certain resources required for irrigation, for example, availability of human operators or sprinklers. Another example that often constrains the irrigation of the fields is the maximum amount of water that can be used for irrigation over a growth season or year. This amount is often decided on by local water authorities or the government in anticipation of droughts. Hydraulic infrastructure constraints: These constraints define the bounds of the daily amount of irrigation. The pumps, channels, and gates conveying water to the fields have a limited capacity. Note that the hydraulic dynamics of water conveyance and the operating of pumps, valves, and gates is not part of this work and will require further research. Any type of resource and hydraulic infrastructure constraints can be included in the framework presented in our work. However, for illustrational purposes, we only consider two resource constraints and one hydraulic infrastructure constraint. The resource constraints are the maximum number of fields that can be irrigated in a day and the maximum irrigation water use of the entire season calculated using the approach from section 8. The hydraulic infrastructure constraint defines an upper bound on the daily amount of irrigation that is determined by the maximum gate flow through the inlet to the fields. 2.4.1 Maximum Number of Fields Scheduled for Irrigation Depending on the water delivery capacity of the hydraulic infrastructure and the daily availability of the aforementioned resources a certain maximum number of fields can be irrigated in a working day. Let δj(k) be the binary decision variable that indicates whether to irrigate a plot at day k. Moreover, let be the desired amount of irrigation. Then, the following mixed-integer linear inequalities (Bemporad & Morari, 1999) will satisfy , : (34a) (34b) (34c) (34d) where (35) (36) It is assumed that the number of fields that can be irrigated on day k of the prediction horizon, Nf(k), is known a priori at each optimization iteration. Thus, to respect the maximum number of fields to irrigate the constraint (37) is sufficient. 2.4.2 Restricting Water Use Over Growth Seasons The seasonal irrigation planner solves the optimization problem from Equation 33a to determine the maximum water use Wa, ℓ, j for each growth stage ℓ for each field j. This amount can then be used to constrain the water use for each growth stage of each field. However, the prediction horizon may not extend to the entire growth stage. In that case, the daily irrigation controller cannot oversee the consequences of using too much water at the start of the growth season. Therefore, the following constraint is used for the water use of field j in growth stage ℓ in the prediction horizon: (38) where Wprev, ℓ, j is the amount of water that has previously been applied to the field in growth stage ℓ, is the set of days that field j is in growth stage ℓ in the prediction horizon, and is the number of remaining days that field j will be in growth stage ℓ. At the start of each optimization iteration the value of Wprev, ℓ, j is updated with the irrigation from the previous day(s). In case there is a lot of precipitation at the start of the growth stage, the amount irrigated will be small and Wprev, ℓ, j will remain relatively small. As a result, more water is available for the rest of the season. Furthermore, if the water availability changes in the season, the seasonal irrigation planner can optimize Equation 33a again given the new situation and the previously applied water amounts, to obtain a new water distribution schedule for the future growth stages of all fields. 2.5 Operational Optimization Problem Formulation In the daily irrigation control, minimizing the water stress cost defined in Equation 25 results in a minimization of the violation Dv(k) for all fields over the prediction horizon. As a result, Equation 14 can be rewritten into (39) (40) As the optimization problem is linear, the minimization of Dv(k) implicitly also minimizes D(k); consequently, Equation 3 can be rewritten as follows: (41) (42) Reformulation of the two state update equations (Equations 3 and 14) into four linear inequalities eliminates the need to model their switching behavior using binary variables, reducing the computational burden significantly. However, the optimization problem is still an MILP problem, due to the operational irrigation constraints: (43a) (43b) (43c) (43d) (43e) (43f) (43g) (43h) where β ∈ [0, 1] is a weight factor indicating the relative importance of water use minimization with respect to water stress minimization and γ(k) > 0 is a weight factor indicating the relative importance of irrigating earlier or later in the prediction horizon. Furthermore, Dv, j(k) is the RZD upper bound violation on field j. Note that the bold symbols (e.g., D(k)) denote vectors containing the respective variables for each field in the plantation. The formulated MILP problem can be efficiently solved using state-of-the-art MILP solvers such as CPLEX or Gurobi. 3 Model Identification and Validation The control approach proposed in our work will be evaluated on a simulation of a specific furrow-irrigated area of the Xinavane Sugar Estates (Tongaat Hulett) in Xinavane, Mozambique (see Figure 4). Figure 4 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint In (a) the geographical location of the study area is depicted. In (b) the layout of the fields subject in this work is depicted. A pumping station pumps water out of the river into a system of concrete canals from which the water is conveyed into earth canals by opening gates. From the earth canals (that are adjacent to the fields) the water is siphoned into the furrows of the fields. The sugarcane plantation is competing with the water needs of a rapidly urbanizing population downstream, increasing agricultural and industrial water uses under the stresses of climate change (Gelcer et al., 2018). Furthermore, storing water is not possible and the large-scale plantations consist of multiple clusters of fields, which each have their own (downstream) pumping stations that draw water from the same river; therefore, Tongaat Hulett has the objective to use as little possible as water while maximizing yield. The selected area has a size of approximately 420 ha divided over 24 plot served by a network of open canals. Each plot consists of two to four fields, adding up to 79 fields in the selected area. There is an upstream gate and canal present for each of the fields, so they can be irrigated separately. The fields are currently irrigated every 3–4 days by human operators, the net irrigation requirement is approximately 1,650 mm/year, and the average precipitation in the area is approximately 650 mm/year. Through a network of open canals each field is provided water by an upstream gate with a maximum capacity of 60 liters per second. This maximum flow to the field together with the 8 hour working day of the operators, constrain the maximum amount of irrigation that can be applied to each plot. Each of the fields considered in this work is modeled as an agrohydrological system in AquaCrop-OS, using soil and crop parameters that are representative of the in-field situation in Xinavane (and that are taken the same for each field). Note that lateral dynamics are not included in the modeling approach: So fields have no effect on adjacent fields. Furthermore, the rainfall and temperature is assumed equivalent for each field, as the fields are located in the same geographically small (same weather) area. Note that the application efficiency of furrow irrigation is incorporated in the identification process of the water balance model used in the daily irrigation controller; therefore, our method is not restricted to a specific infield irrigation strategy as we can account for the different application efficiencies in the MPC model. The complete set of parameters of the soil, the crop, and the field management settings used for modeling the fields can be found in the supporting information. 3.1 Data for Agrohydrological Modeling For each field in the case study area, the recorded planting and harvest dates from 2013–2017 were used. Furthermore, from conversations with local operators and management the local irrigation practice can be summarized as follows: After initially planting the sugarcane (or shoots in case of ratooning), the (dry) field is irrigated to field capacity to promote the germination, this initial irrigation cycle can take up to 3 days. Next, over the course of the growth season the field is irrigated to field capacity with an irrigation frequency of once every 4 days. Finally, when the sugarcane has matured, the field is harvested and after approximately one week the field is replanted and the next growth season commences. Unfortunately, accurate and sufficiently detailed data on local irrigation records and soil moisture measurements were not available. Therefore, using the aforementioned irrigation practice, real historic growth season weather data, and the calibrated soil and crop parameters (e.g., canopy decline/growth coefficients, soil evaporation coefficients, and soil composition; see the supporting information), the growth seasons are recreated using simulations in AquaCrop-OS. The resulting data set of 316 growth seasons spread over 5 years and 79 fields can then be used for identification of the proposed model. This data set consists of evapotranspiration data, canopy cover data, soil moisture data, rooting depth data, and yield data. 3.2 Identifying and Validating the Evapotranspiration Model The evapotranspiration model (see Equation 11) uses an estimate of the size of the canopy cover as a function of thermal time (in the form of an NDVI-CGDD curve, see Equations 9 and 11) to fit the coefficients α1, α2, and α3 using the evapotranspiration data set generated in AquaCrop-OS. However, AquaCrop-OS does not generate NDVI data; instead, canopy cover data are directly used to estimate the size of the canopy cover as a function of the thermal time. The average evolution of the canopy cover over thermal time is estimated using a random half of the generated canopy cover data set. During each growth season the evolution of the canopy cover will be slightly different, due to different atmospheric conditions. To obtain a smooth curve that best describes the average canopy cover development, we use the following procedure: Divide the canopy cover data points into Ng groups, based on evenly spaced sections of the thermal time. This number of groups depends on the density of the data: The more data points the more groups can be used. For each group calculate the average thermal time and the average size of the canopy cover; this is a new data point. Therefore, the number of groups should be chosen such that the distance between the new data points is minimized, while still obtaining a smooth curve. Finally, draw a curve through the new averaged data points. We use a Piecewise Cubic Hermite Interpolating Polynomial (PCHIP) (Fritsch & Butland, 1984) that interpolates the data locally using a cubic function. Note that quadratic or linear interpolation can also be used. In this case, cubic interpolation was chosen as a compromise between number of coefficients and accuracy of the fit. The resulting size of the canopy cover when using is depicted in Figure 5. In Figure 5a, the raw data points of the size of the canopy cover as a function of thermal time are depicted that are obtained by simulating local practice of irrigating to full capacity every 4 days. Note the enlarged box illustrating the (tight) spread of the data. In Figure 5b the resulting PCHIP curve is plotted that connects the decimated data points. The curve is smooth without any sudden jumps. Figure 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint In (a) the canopy cover data points are depicted. In (b) the decimated data points (triangles) and the resulting PCHIP curve are shown. In (c) the modeling errors of the evapotranspiration model are depicted as a function of the thermal time. Next, the canopy cover PCHIP approximation, temperature data, and reference evapotranspiration data from the identification half of the data set are used to estimate the model coefficients from Equation 11 using linear least squares. The model coefficients are determined as with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.55 mm and a variance accounted for (VAF) of 93.58%. Furthermore, in Figure 5c the spread of the modeling error as a function of the thermal time for the validation set is depicted. Here, the modeling error (ME) is defined as follows: (44) The evapotranspiration model performs best when the canopy cover reaches its maximum size. Conversely, when the size of the canopy cover is low and when the crop starts to age the contribution of the evaporation to the overall evapotranspiration is high. The evaporation dynamics are not well captured as wetting events are not included in the modeling. However, the model is still able to provide estimates for the evapotranspiration within a 25% error margin for over 75% of the growth season. Furthermore, sugarcane is relatively insensitive to water stress in the last growth stage (Doorenbos & Kassam, 1979; Robertson & Donaldson, 1998); therefore, modeling errors in this growth stage will likely not have a large influence on the controller's performance. We note that the spread of the canopy cover data points is rather small and unrealistic in Figure 5a. To illustrate that the proposed method also works in the real world, we have also constructed an NDVI-CGDD curve using real NDVI data for the Xinavane area, which is shown in the supporting information for this manuscript. 4 Simulation Results and Discussion To evaluate the performance of the proposed feedback control scheme, we conduct closed-loop simulations with the complex crop water productivity model AquaCrop-OS. Although our control model uses a simple water balance (see Equation 1) with only a nonzero drainage term when the soil becomes saturated (see Equation 3), the AquaCrop-OS model does include more complex dynamics; for example filtration is modeled using spatial discretization of the soil layer(s) (Raes et al., 2009). The sufficiency of a simple control model is shown in the closed-loop performance of three complex system simulations on AquaCrop-OS in sections 18–20. In the first simulation, we investigate the effect of decreasing the water availability on the yield, when using the proposed control scheme. In the second simulation, a comparison is made between the performance of the local irrigation approach and the proposed MPC approach in terms of water productivity and yield. In the last simulation, the water saving capabilities of the MPC approach are compared with that of the local irrigation approach by constraining the amount of irrigation for each growth season. 4.1 Simulation Settings The goal of the simulations is to investigate the maximum (theoretical) benefit that can be achieved by using an optimal control approach. Therefore, no stochastics are added to the simulations and perfect root zone soil moisture measurements for all fields are assumed to be available at the start of each day. In the preseason, the soil moisture measurements that the daily irrigation controller receives are at an depth of 30 cm, the depth at which the roots initially establish after planting. Furthermore, a perfect forecast of the evapotranspiration, temperature, rainfall, and planting and harvest dates is assumed to be available to the daily irrigation controller. Conversely, the controller imitating the local irrigation practice has information on the exact amount of irrigation required to irrigate to field capacity and applies this to the field, provided it does not violate the maximum amount of irrigation. To that end, each field is provided water by an upstream gate with a maximum capacity of 60 L/s. This maximum flow to the field together with the 8 hr working day of the operators constrains the maximum amount of irrigation that can be applied to each field. The sensitivity indices and growth stage definitions that the two-level approach uses are listed in Table 1. The sensitivity indices are derived from Moutonnet (2002), the growth stage lengths in number of days are retrieved from the provided example files for sugarcane in AquaCrop-OS, and the thermal times are calculated using Equation 4 with a base temperature and maximum temperature of 12°C and 32°C, respectively, and historic data from Xinavane. Table 1. Growth Stage Definitions Used for Simulations Growth stage Length (days) Length (CGDD) λℓ Establishment 7 82 0.4a Tillering 53 618 1.2a Yield formation 270 3,151 1.2a Ripening 35 408 0.1b a These values are taken from Moutonnet (2002). b This value is taken from Doorenbos and Kassam (1979). All simulations start on 30 May 2013, 7 days before the first field is planted and end on 31 December 2017. In this period, all fields will have had four full growth seasons. The relative cost of irrigation to water stress is set to , a value small enough to ensure the controller irrigates whenever necessary to avoid violating the RZD upper bound and big enough to provide an incentive to not waste water. Moreover, irrigation should be delayed if it is not directly required to avoid violating the defined soil moisture bounds. To provide this information to the daily MPC controller, we penalize irrigation at the end of the prediction with and with (see Equation 43c) at the beginning of the horizon and linearly interpolate the cost between the two. Finally, the fraction of the available water at which the crop starts to experience stress is set to %. An important remark is that the daily MPC controller can irrigate in the fields in the preseason, if necessary. However, no costs are included in the optimization problem to penalize soil moisture deficits in the preseason; therefore, if the controller decides to irrigate a field in the preseason it is only in anticipation of a soil moisture threshold violation after the field has been planted. Furthermore, as mentioned above irrigation is delayed unless necessary to avoid violating the RZD bounds. Therefore, the daily irrigation controller will only irrigate in the preseason if the field is too dry before planting or when the daily irrigation controller is constrained by an irrigation frequency (which is the case in Simulations 2 and 3 in sections 19 and 20, respectively). Note that if the daily irrigation controller applies irrigation in the preseason the used water is added to the total water use in the upcoming season in all simulations. 4.2 Simulation 1: Effect of Decreasing Water Availability on Yield The effect of water stress on yield (summarized in yield sensitivity indices) is often based on open-loop predictions and regression methods. Therefore, in this first simulation we investigate the effects of restricting water use on closed-loop results. First, we establish the potential water use when using full (optimal) irrigation: Each of the fields can be irrigated daily, only limited by the maximum amount of water that can be provided by the upstream gate and the length of a working day. Ideally, the prediction horizon covers the whole growth season; however, limited by the available memory on the computer used for simulations we set the length of the prediction horizon to  days (as large as possible). As the irrigation frequency is not bounded for this simulation, the constraints from Equation 34a are relaxed (removing all integer variables from the optimization problem) and the problem is reduced to a continuous linear programming problem. The results indicate, for each field, how much water is required in each growth stage for maximum yield. Then, for a fraction of this potential water use we calculate the optimal water allocation for each growth season of each individual field using Equation 32. These amounts are then used to constrain the water use in each growth stage of each field. The result is an approximation of the upper bound of the crop kite (from Figure 3), see the beeswarm plot in Figure 6a. The yield declines progressively as the water is increasingly restricted. In Figure 6b, the rainfall and evapotranspiration data is depicted for each of the seasons. The low amount of rainfall in Season 3 explains the rapid yield decline when reducing actual water use: The decrease in amount of irrigation is a larger proportion of the total seasonal water in dry seasons than rainy seasons. The reason that Season 1 maintains a higher yield under water stress than the other seasons is that the soil moisture is initialized at field capacity for all fields. Therefore, a buffer of water is retained in the soil below the crop's roots, which is tapped into as the root depth increases. After the first season, this extra water source can be depleted. Figure 6 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint In (a) the effect of decreasing water use on the yield is depicted in beeswarm plots; for each restricted water use on the horizontal axis a collection of points is depicted that represent the relative yields of each field in the seasons. This figure shows the reduction in yield we can expect when water use is reduced under different atmospheric conditions. To clarify the spread of the results the potential evapotranspiration is plotted against the rainfall in (b). 4.3 Simulation 2: MPC Versus Local Irrigation Practice In this second simulation, we compare the performance of the proposed MPC approach with that of the irrigation practice described in section 14. In this local irrigation practice of Mozambique, the fields are irrigated every 4 days. Constraints are added on the number of fields that can be irrigated each day (Equation 37) to ensure the daily MPC controller does not irrigate more frequently than the local practice. Furthermore, both the MPC and the local irrigation approach have no maximum water use constraint in this simulation. The optimization problem that is repeatedly solved by the daily MPC controller at each time step in Simulations 2 and 3 belong to the class of MILPs, which we solve using Gurobi (v8.1.1) (Gurobi Optimization, 2015) accessed via its MATLAB interface. Although Gurobi can find solutions with arbitrarily small optimality gaps to the globally optimal solution, the computational effort (measured in CPU time) can become too large based on problem size and the prescribed optimality gap. To complete our simulations to ‘near’ optimality within a reasonable time frame, we set the prediction horizon length to  days and set the relative optimality gap tolerance to 1%. To account for pathological cases we limit the maximum computation time to 3,600 s. This prediction horizon is still large enough to cover the first two growth stages completely (7 and 53 days, respectively). In Figure 7, we show the amount of water used for irrigation in all four seasons against the final attained yields for all fields. For all fields, the MPC controller uses less water while producing an equal or higher yield than the local irrigation practice. The amount of water that the MPC controller can save with respect to the local practice seems to be proportional to the amount of rainfall in a season. This is especially noticeable in Figure 7c, where the difference in water use is small and the season was relatively dry (see Figure 6b). Figure 7 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint A comparison of the water productivity of the MPC controller and the local irrigation practice for each of the four growth seasons. In (a)–(d) the results of, respectively, Seasons 1–4 are shown. 4.4 Simulation 3: Irrigation Under Water Scarcity To illustrate the water saving capabilities of our MPC approach over the local approach of simply irrigating every few days (described in section 14), we now consider a simulation scenario in which available water volume is limited. As opposed to the first simulation, we limit the TAW volume of all the fields combined to 80% of the potential total water use (established by the results from the first simulation). Therefore, in this simulation we solve the optimization problem from Equation 33a for all fields at once (for one growth season at a time). The result is a maximum water volume per growth stage per field for a single growth season, such that the overall crop yield of that season is maximized. These maximum water volumes are then converted to irrigation depths using the surface areas of the fields. Finally, the irrigation depth per season per field is constrained using the inequality constraint from Equation 38. Note that, similarly to the second simulation, the irrigation frequency is limited by imposing constraints on the number of fields that can be irrigated in a day. When the real plantation in Xinavane faces drought, the local staff reduces the irrigation frequency in an attempt to reduce the water use. The workers always irrigate the fields to field capacity, in order to minimize the number of revisits to each field. We compare the water use of the local irrigation practice with an irrigation frequency of 4, 5, 6, and 7 days with that of the MPC controller. The results are listed in Table 2. Only the MPC controller is able to meet the water volume constraints; the local approach uses too much water in all of the seasons for all the irrigation frequencies. Note that even though the MPC controller irrigates in the preseason the total amount of irrigation for the season is not exceeded. Table 2.

In this work, we propose a methodology to reduce this complex problem into two separate optimal control problems, which are solved using a two-level structure consisting of a seasonal irrigation planner and a daily MPC irrigation controller. The seasonal irrigation planner considers the allocation of the available water of the upcoming growth season over the crop stages of each field, such that the overall yield is maximized. For the optimization of this water allocation, we assume that within a crop stage the allocated water is distributed perfectly temporally and spatially such that the water stress is minimized. This minimization of the daily water stress is realized by an MPC controller that decides on the daily irrigation amounts of each field, such that the water stress is minimized for all fields, while not exceeding the total water amounts that were allocated for each field by the seasonal irrigation planner. Although the realized precipitation and temperature in the season may be different from those of the optimal plan proposed by the seasonal irrigation scheduler, the MPC controller receives daily measurements and consequently updates its policy accordingly to correct for the deviations from the optimal plan. For the seasonal irrigation planner we describe the total expected yield over multiple fields by the summation of crop yields computed by the multiplicative compounding yield function from (Raes et al., 2006). As this function is highly nonlinear and nonconvex, the difficulty to find optimal solutions scales exponentially with the number of fields. Therefore, we approximate it using an alternative problem formulation. The result is an efficient formulation of the seasonal irrigation planner that determines the optimal water distribution over the fields to maximize the overall yield, subject to local operational constraints such as restrictions on seasonal water volume or fertilizer amounts. The MPC controller minimizes the daily water stress by scheduling irrigation such that the soil moisture of the fields is regulated within a water-stress-free zone. This requires a model of the interaction between the soil, the atmosphere, and the crop. A simple water balance model is created for which the saturation dynamics are modeled explicitly using conditionally switched depletion dynamics. Furthermore, evapotranspiration is predicted using a linear model based on remote sensing measurements of the canopy cover, temperature data, and evaporation and transpiration data obtained from closed-loop simulations in AquaCrop-OS. The effect of water stress on the crop yield is included in the cost function of the daily irrigation controller using an additive crop production function. This provides the daily controller with information on which fields have priority in receiving water. The two-level approach presented can handle resource and hydraulic infrastructure constraints. Therefore, the approach is generic as it is not restricted to a specific irrigation method, crop, soil type, or local environment. The performance of our two-level approach is evaluated on three closed-loop simulations in AquaCrop-OS of a sugarcane plantation (from Tongaat Hulett) located in Xinavane, Mozambique. The parameters in AquaCrop-OS are set to match the parameters of the real plantation. Then, using the local standard irrigation practice (irrigate each field every few days) from the Xinavane sugarcane plantation the growth seasons from 2013 till 2017 are recreated. This data set is then used to identify the water balance model parameters and evapotranspiration model parameters. The goal of the simulations is to investigate the maximum (theoretical) benefit that can be achieved using our optimal control approach. In the first simulation, we study the effect of water scarcity on the season yield under our proposed two-level approach. The results give an indication of the decline of yield as a function of water availability that can be expected. This can be useful information for decision makers to decide on the water distribution of upcoming seasons. In the second simulation, the water productivity of the proposed two-level approach is compared to a simple heuristic of irrigating the fields to field capacity every 4 days. Our two-level approach achieves the same seasonal yield as the local irrigation practice, while using up to 30% less water. In the third simulation, the total water use is restricted to 80% of the potential water use and the capabilities of the local irrigation practice and our optimal control approach in producing feasible irrigation schedules are tested. Our control approach is able to satisfy the water use constraint while maximizing the water productivity. The local approach of irrigation every few days to field capacity was not able to constrain seasonal water use to a feasible amount. A next step toward implementation of closed-loop algorithms such as the one proposed in our paper is creating reliable observers for soil moisture. Such an observer could be designed by combining in situ and satellite remote sensing data approaches to create soil moisture measurements, which can then be incorporated into the control loop. Furthermore, our future work will explore stochastic MPC methods for hedging land, water (and labor) allocation against uncertainty in water availability within the proposed framework. Another step to take for implementation is to evaluate the effect of the uncertainty of rainfall. However, under sparse rainfall events the effect of the rainfall uncertainty on the performance will likely be minimal as the controller can change the irrigation schedules following a measurement after a rainfall event has occurred. Nonetheless, the effect that uncertainty of rainfall has on irrigation control will need to be researched more in depth to render our approach feasible for a broader range of climates.

Abstract The demand for freshwater resources has increased in recent times and has been exacerbated by escalating global population and increasing drought indices in the world’s agricultural zones. Irrigated agriculture is inevitably a wasteful water user that has deprived other sectors of the scarce resource. Improving water use efficiency in irrigated agriculture is therefore crucial for sustainable agricultural production to thrive. There is potential to improve water use efficiency through smart irrigation systems, especially with the advent of wireless communication technologies, monitoring systems, and advanced control strategies for optimal irrigation scheduling. This paper reviews state-of-the-art smart monitoring and irrigation control strategies that have been used in recent years for irrigation scheduling. From the literature review, closed-loop irrigation control strategies are efficient than open-loop systems which do not cater for uncertainties. It is argued that combining soil-based, plant, and weather-based monitoring methods in a modelling environment with model predictive control can significantly improve water use efficiency. This review shall help researchers and farmers to choose the best irrigation monitoring and control strategy to improve irrigation scheduling in open field agricultural systems.

Introduction Agriculture is the backbone of most economies in the world as it contributes significantly to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and provides food security (World Bank, 2020d). Conversely, agriculture has been regarded as a significant water user sector as it abstracts 70% of the world’s freshwater resources to irrigate 25% of the world's croplands (FAO, 2020a, FAO, 2017a, Khokhar, 2017). Climate change and increasing population do impose additional pressure to resources, such as water availability, that are vital for agricultural production (Ungureanu et al., 2020). According to the Anon (2019), the world population will hit 9.7 billion by 2050 translating into increased demand for nutritious food and water resources. The Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) forecasts a more than 50% increase in irrigated food production by 2050, which will require a 10% increase in water abstracted for agriculture, provided water productivity improves (FAO, 2020b). The land on which food is cultivated does not expand, which means agricultural cropping systems need to utilize the available water and land resources efficiently to feed the future population. Understanding the mechanisms that can improve water use efficiency and result in significant water savings and higher yield is therefore paramount. Water use efficiency in irrigated agriculture is the ratio of estimated irrigation water requirements to the actual water withdrawal (FAO, 2020a). Water use efficiency is dimensionless and can be applied to plant, field, scheme, as well on basin and country scale. Agronomists, however, define water use efficiency in terms of crop yield per amount of water used to produce the yield (Hatfield and Dold, 2019, Sharma et al., 2015, Ullah et al., 2019, Unver et al., 2017). Water use efficiency has gained significant attention from researchers as water scarcity continues to vary in both space and time across the world due to the effects of climate change (Hess and Knox, 2013). Competition from other sectors of the economy for the scarce water resource has made agriculturalists, irrigation engineers, and policy-makers revisit the way water is used in agriculture. Apparently, state of the-art approaches to water management and systems will need to be adopted to address declining land base and water allocations to meet agricultural production needs. Precision agricultural technologies are key in ensuring a higher water use efficiency (Evans and Sadler, 2008). Precision agriculture is at the centre to shape itself to provide solutions to the overarching problems in agriculture. Yin et al. (2021) described precision agriculture as the “use of technologies that integrate sensors, information systems, enhanced machinery, and informed management to improve production by accounting for dynamics within sustainable agricultural systems”. Precision agriculture and smart irrigation, in particular, enables farmers to save precious resources without subjecting plants to moisture deficiency (Pierce, 2010). Smart irrigation involves the application of water at the right time, in the right amounts, and at the right spot in the field (Singh et al., 2019). Therefore, it requires the use of monitoring and control strategies for optimum irrigation scheduling taking into consideration the variation in soil moisture conditions, changing weather patterns, and plant physiological conditions. Conventional irrigation systems apply irrigation water without considering the spatiotemporal variation of soil characteristics and changes in weather variables that affect crop evapotranspiration (Vories et al., 2021). This subsequently leads to spatial variation in the actual depth of irrigation water received by plants. Applying more than required irrigation water results in fertilizer leaching, deep percolation, and surface ponding and runoff while inadequate irrigation may lead to plant stress that may result in a reduction in crop yield and quality. Implementing an optimised irrigation schedule through a smart irrigation system requires sensors to monitor soil, plant, weather conditions. On the other hand, irrigation control deals with the allocation of inputs and making necessary adjustments according to the crop response to save irrigation water while mitigating the effects of disturbances and uncertainties (Abioye et al., 2020a, Zazueta et al., 2008). Over the past few years, several survey articles have been published on improving water use efficiency in irrigated agriculture (Chai et al., 2014, Hatfield and Dold, 2019, Howell, 2001, Taheripour et al., 2016, Ullah et al., 2019). Other past reviews have focused on the use of smart technologies like smart sensors, Internet of Things (IoT), Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) in agriculture (Adeyemi et al., 2017, Hamami and Nassereddine, 2020, Koech and Langat, 2018, Li et al., 2020, Velmurugan et al., 2020, Zinkernagel et al., 2020). One of the most recent survey papers in the realm of smart irrigation was performed by Abioye et al. (2020b). The authors highlight the application of monitoring and control strategies in precision irrigation. In our opinion, the authors give a valuable start to fellow researchers interested in smart irrigation. However, concerning the application of monitoring and control strategies for water use efficiency improvement, to the best of our knowledge, there appear to be very limited systematic literature reviews. The authors fail to show how monitoring and control strategies water use efficiency in precision agriculture. This review further builds upon existing literature by combining both smart strategies used in monitoring crop water use and irrigation control techniques to improve water use efficiency. 2. Real-time irrigation scheduling Irrigation scheduling is the decision of when and how much water to apply to the field and thus has a direct effect on water use efficiency (Broner, 2005); and (Koech and Langat, 2018). The quantity of water to be applied is estimated using a criterion to determine the irrigation requirement and strategy to prescribe how much to apply. Efficient application of irrigation water requires an understanding of the dynamics of plant water use, which has a relationship with the weather, soil characteristics, and plant physiology. Efficient irrigation scheduling applies irrigation water at the right time and in the right quantity to optimize production and offset adverse environmental impacts. On the other hand, poor irrigation scheduling results in under-watering or waterlogging which affects water use efficiency (Hassan et al., 2021). Real-time irrigation scheduling is pertinent in saving water by applying the quantity required to meet plant needs. Several irrigation scheduling tools have been developed to help irrigators apply water precisely to crops (Andales et al., 2019). Growers who do not use any irrigation scheduling tool often rely on their experience to schedule irrigation (Anon, 2010). Recent research has proved that growers who rely on heuristic methods of scheduling like manual, time-based, and volume-based irrigation scheduling register significant water losses (García et al., 2020). An effective real-time irrigation scheduling event requires monitoring of the factors that affect plant growth and a control strategy for the delivery of the right amounts of irrigation water. 3. Monitoring in smart irrigation systems To improve water use efficiency, it is pertinent to monitor specific factors that influence crop growth and development. Monitoring in the perspective of smart irrigation also entails real-time data collection on the status of soil, plant, and weather parameters cropped area through the use of state-of-the-art communication technologies (Abioye et al., 2020b). The development of a real-time monitoring system involves the integration of sensors with a wireless sensor communication network or IoT framework. Wireless networks are very significant in real-time monitoring for smart irrigation since they have sensing, processing, and transmission capabilities (Hamami and Nassereddine, 2020). The wireless sensor network comprises various sensor nodes connected through a wireless connection module (Hamami and Nassereddine, 2020). Monitoring in smart irrigation can either be soil-based, weather-based, or plant-based monitoring as depicted in Fig. 1.

Soil moisture monitoring Soil moisture monitoring involves measuring either the soil water potential or the soil water content, it has been used widely for irrigation scheduling (Delgoda et al., 2016). Monitoring the soil moisture in the plant root zone is important as it helps in understanding the moisture dynamics and its relationship with the volume of irrigation water and plant water uptake. Several options exist for determining soil moisture levels. The direct soil moisture measurement (gravimetric sampling) and indirect methods like eletromagetic property, heat conductivity, neutron count, water potential, and electrical resistance. With advances in microcomputer and communication technology, varieties of soil sensors for example ground, aerial and satellite moisture sensors are gaining momentum in the suite of irrigation tools (Earth Observation System, 2020a). Soil moisture sensors have a small footprint on the field with sensors at multiple depths, soil moisture dynamics can be captured. Installing the sensors at different depths increases the accuracy and also helps in understanding the changes in soil water content in response to irrigation and crop water use (Soulis et al., 2015). Soil sensors give a wide range of data on the soil's physical, chemical, and mechanical properties taken as optical, radiometric, mechanical, acoustic, electrical, electromagnetic, pneumatic, or electrochemical measurements (Zinkernagel et al., 2020). The measured variables helps in the determination of parameters such as the Maximum Allowable Depletion (MAD) (Li et al., 2020). Detailed descriptions of the functionality of soil moisture sensors and their characteristics can be found in Pardossi et al. (2009); and Pardossi and Incrocci (2011); and Thompson et al. (2017). Fig. 2 presents the most commonly used soil moisture sensors in research and vegetable production. Download : Download high-res image (357KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Soil moisture sensors in research and vegetable production. Adapted from: (De Pascale et al., 2018, Thompson et al., 2017, Zinkernagel et al., 2020). Determination of spatiotemporal variability of soil moisture content is vital for various applications, this has prompted the development of different measurement techniques over the last years. Soil moisture content is measured as Volumetric Moisture Content (VMC). Soil moisture content sensors infer volumetric moisture content based on changes in the thermal properties or electrical properties of the soil (Peddinti et al., 2020). The electrical-based sensors used to measure Volumetric Moisture Content rely on the propagation of electromagnetic waves in the soil. These sensors fall into various types i.e, Frequency Domain Reflectometry (FDR), Time-Domain Reflectometry (TDR), capacitance, and resistance sensors. Frequency Domain Reflectometry sensors are capable of determining the bulk dielectric constant by measuring the frequency variations of an electro-magnetic pulse propagated into the soil (Fertinnowa, 2020b). Lozoya et al. (2016) used FDR sensors to measure field volumetric soil moisture content. The sensor node was implemented with a low-cost Arduino Mega board based on an ATmega 328 microcontroller. The sensors were placed on crop root level and had a volumetric moisture content range of 0 – 50% with 0.1% resolution. To optimize water use efficiency in vegetables, Yadav et al. (2020) used six (6) capacitance soil moisture-based sensors with a data logger at three (3) locations. The authors programmed irrigation scheduling using upper field capacity and lower thresholds of soil available water. The results revealed an improvement in water use efficiency compared to conventional methods of irrigation scheduling. Domínguez-Niño et al. (2020) reported that using capacitance-type soil moisture sensors combined with FAO’s soil water balance model provided a sound basis for automated irrigation scheduling in orchards. The disadvantage associated with soil moisture-based irrigation scheduling is that plant water uptake and stress does not only respond to the soil water content but also to atmospheric conditions, nutrient availability, root zone salinity, and pest and disease infestation. With variation in soil characteristics, accurate irrigation schedules are established if many representative monitoring sites are established rather than using a single point. Recently, researchers are combining remote sensing with ground sensors to solve the problem of heterogeneity (Ahmad et al., 2021, Babaeian et al., 2019, Klemas et al., 2014). Liao et al. (2021) in experimenting with a smart irrigation system in a greenhouse using soil moisture sensors used a logic diagram to describe the irrigation scheduling process as shown in Fig. 3. Download : Download high-res image (209KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Soil moisture-based irrigation scheduling. Adopted from Liao et al. (2021). 3.2. Weather-based monitoring Weather-based monitoring involves real-time estimation of reference evapotranspiration ET using measured weather parameters and thus indicates the water lost by the plants and the soil environment (Abioye et al., 2020b, Adeyemi et al., 2017). The quantity of water lost through evapotranspiration depends on humidity, wind speed, solar radiation, and air temperature. The temporal dynamics of evapotranspiration on hourly or daily timescales is appropriate for determining crop water use in smart irrigation systems. Where soil or plant measurements are not possible, weather parameters are used to give an approximate irrigation schedule (White and Raine, 2008). The FAO Penman-Monteith equation discussed in Allen et al. (1998), presents a procedure for calculating hourly or daily evapotranspiration values using standard climatological measurements of air temperature, solar radiation, humidity, and wind speed. The daily crop water use can then be estimated using Eq. 1. (1) Where; Crop evapotranspiration (mm day−1) Crop coefficient Reference evapotranspiration (mm day−1). Most real-time weather-based monitoring systems have an automatic weather station with sensors for humidity, temperature, wind speed, rainfall, solar radiation, and atmospheric pressure (Adeyemi et al., 2017). Dataloggers are configured to automatically acquire data at a set interval and the data is then transmitted via a communication system to an online data access portal. The data logger manages communication protocols with the remote server using a WSN or IoT framework. The data is sent to smart irrigation controllers that combine with site-specific variables such as soil type to adjust irrigation schedules (Hydropoint, 2017b). The factors that affect the performance and choice of a weather monitoring system range from robustness, accuracy, installation and maintenance requirements, measurement suite, remote data acquisition, season capabilities, and power requirements. (Khoa et al., 2019) implemented smart water management in farming using an IoT platform. The authors proposed a novel topology of sensor nodes using affordable and efficient components. With a LoRa LPWAN (Long Range Low Power Wide Area Network) technology transmission module, the authors reported good performance of the system. Similarly, Wasson et al. (2017), used a weather-based monitoring system and transmitted the real-time air temperature, solar radiation, wind speed, and humidity data via a wireless communication standard. Coelho et al. (2020) developed a system for monitoring soil moisture and environmental parameters using the IoT. Data acquisition was carried out employing sensors connected to a micro-controller system, and the signals were transmitted through a radio frequency module using the LoRaWanTM protocol. Irrigation schedules developed using weather measurements are widely used, however, the soil characteristics often used for estimating soil water volume are based on the soil texture and yet soil structure and organic matter content affect available soil moisture. 3.3. Plant-based monitoring Irrigation scheduling can be achieved by monitoring the plant-water-status indices. The relationship between crop water stress and soil water deficit makes it possible to estimate irrigation scheduling. The sensitivity of the measurement made to determine water deficit in a plant at a particular crop stage influences the efficiency of plant-based irrigation scheduling (Gu et al., 2020). Jones (2004) classified plant-based monitoring into plant-water-status monitoring which involves direct measurement of leaf, xylem, or stems water potential and plant physiologic monitoring that involves stomatal conductance, thermal sensing, sap flow, and xylem cavitation measurements. 3.3.1. Leaf turgor pressure sensors Leaf turgor pressure sensors detect leaf water stress by measuring relative changes in leaf turgor pressure (Zimmermann et al., 2013). The magnitude of turgor pressure is dictated by rootwater uptake, transpirational water loss and by the celluar osmotic pressure. An example of the leaf turgor pressure sensor is the non-invasive leaf patch clamp pressure probe also know as the ZIM-Probe. The ZIM-probe provides real-time measurements of even minute changes in turgor pressure within leaves (Zimmermann, 2011, Zimmermann et al., 2013). It consists of two stamps that are each equipped with a magnet. One stamp also contains a sensitive pressure sensoring-element, which sends detected pressure changes to the ZIMtransmitter and telemetric unit. The counter stamp contains a screw thread, which enables adjustment of the distance between the two magnets as depicted in Fig. 4. The ZIM-probe has been successfully tested under laboratory, greenhouse and field conditions on a variety of herbaceous and woody plant species (e.g. grapevine, barley, arabidopsis, tomato, tobacco, banana, paprika, wheat, maize, beech, oak, populus, olive, avocado, plum, orange, grapefruit, and eucalyptus).

Leaf thickness sensors Advances in electronic technologies have enabled researchers to develop small leaf thickness sensors. (Afzal et al., 2017, Seelig et al., 2012) developed tiny leaf sensors and evaluated them on a tomato plant (Solanum lycopersicum) and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) respectively. Seelig et al. (2012) observed that irrigation timing based on leaf thickness measurements improved water use efficiency by 25–45% compared to the preset irrigation scheduling treatments. Afzal et al. (2017) reported that the daily CAP variations decreased when soil moisture was below the wilting point and completely ceased below the soil volumetric water content of 11%, suggesting that the effect of water stress on CAP was observed through its impact on photosynthesis. The results suggest that leaf thickness and CAP can be used for estimating plant water status. These studies suggested leaf thickness variations as a feasible plant-based method for monitoring water status. 3.3.3. Sap flow sensors The development of reliable heat pulse and energy balance thermal sensors for sap-flow measurement in the stems of plants has opened up an alternative approach to irrigation scheduling based on measurements of sap-flow rates (Jones, 2004). Because sap-flow rates are expected to be sensitive to water deficits and especially to stomatal closure, many workers have tested the use of sap-flow measurement for irrigation scheduling and control in a diverse range of crops, including grapevine (Jones, 2004). The Dynagage Sap Flow Sensors are the latest technology for measuring the sap flow, and thus the water consumption of plants (Ecotechtonic, 2016). These energy balance sensors measure the amount of heat carried by the sap which is converted into real-time sap flow in grams or kilograms per hour. The sensors are non-intrusive and not harmful since the plants are heated up 1 °C to 5 °C typically. The principles of heat balance sensors are scientifically proven and references exist for most major crops and many tree species. Unlike other methods, Dynagages require no calibration since sap flux is directly determined by the energy balance and rates of heat convection by the sap flow (Dynamax Inc, 2007). The need for this new technology is great because it is an affordable and practical way to measure the water use by plants of agricultural, economic and ecological importance. Plants in greenhouses, nurseries or in natural environments can be measured with the same ease. 3.3.4. Xylem cavitation sensors In transpiring plants, water in the xylem vessels is under tension. This tension is directly proportional to the water deficit to such an extent that the water columns can fracture, or ‘cavitate’(Jones, 2004). The cavitation events lead to the explosive formation of a bubble, initially containing water vapour. These cavitation events can be detected acoustically in the audio or ultrasonic-frequencies, and the resulting embolisms may restrict water flow through the stem. Substantial evidence, though largely circumstantial, now indicates that the ultrasonic acoustic emissions (AEs) detected as plants become stressed do indeed indicate cavitation events and that AE rates can be used as an indicator of plant ‘stress’. 3.3.5. Stem diameter variation Stem and fruit diameters fluctuate diurnally in response to changes in water content, and so suffer from many of the same disadvantages as other water status measures. Nevertheless, the diurnal dynamics of changes in diameter, especially of fruits, have been used to derive rather more sensitive indicators of irrigation need, where the magnitude of daily shrinkage has been used to indicate water status, and comparisons of diameters at the same time on succeeding days give a measure of growth rate. Although changes in growth rate provide a particularly sensitive measure of plant water stress, such daily measurements are not particularly useful for the control of high-frequency irrigation systems. Nevertheless, several workers have achieved promising results for low-frequency irrigation scheduling by the use of maximum daily shrinkage (MDS). New trends in plant-based monitoring involve the use of optical sensors to assess the status of plant water stress, drought, nutrient level, and pest and disease infestation. Optical sensors are broadly classified into contact or non-contact sensors. Whereas contact sensors are physically mounted so that they are in contact with the plant, non-contact sensors are either proximal (handheld, fixed or vehicle-mounted) or remote (aerial and satellite-based data acquisition) (Adeyemi et al., 2017). Several researchers including Aleotti et al. (2018), Jia et al. (2019), and Uddin et al. (2017) have generated irrigation maps through monitoring vegetation using unmanned aerial vehicles with high-resolution cameras. Similarly, Lozoya et al. (2019) employed spectral reflectance sensors to estimate the health status of the plant in a controlled environment agriculture experiment. The authors found out that the two methods achieved similar spectral results on the health status of the plant, which could be integrated with soil moisture sensing for optimal irrigation control. The major constraint in the application of plant-based sensors for commercial irrigation scheduling is that they do not provide a direct measurement of the quantity of irrigation water to be applied (White and Raine, 2008). It requires using plant-based irrigation scheduling conjunctively with soil moisture measurement and the soil water balance model. Table 1 summarizes the monitoring strategies that have been employed in recent years to schedule irrigation. Table 1. Summary of monitoring strategies for irrigation scheduling.

Irrigation control strategies for smart irrigation systems For irrigation to be sustainable, control strategies that apply irrigation water precisely have to be adopted. An irrigation controller is an essential part of the irrigation system and helps to achieve labour savings in addition to applying the required volume of irrigation water for a specified period leading to high efficiency in water, energy, and fertilizer use (Boman et al., 2018). Irrigation control strategies are divided into open-loop systems and closed-loop systems. While open-loop systems apply a preset action like in simple irrigation timers, closed-loop systems receive feedback from sensors, make decisions and apply the resulting decisions to the irrigation system. Fig. 4 presents a detailed classification of irrigation control strategies derived from literature studies. 4.1. Open-loop irrigation control In an open-loop system, the operator decides on the amount of water that will be applied and when the irrigation will take place (Boman et al., 2018). This information is then programmed into the controller and the water is applied according to the desired schedule. Open-loop systems are either time-based or volume-based as shown in Fig. 5 (Abioye et al., 2020b). Open-loop systems have a clock that is used to start and stop irrigation events (Zazueta et al., 2008). Download : Download high-res image (519KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Classification of irrigation control strategies. Adapted from (Abioye et al., 2020b, Boman et al., 2018, McCarthy et al., 2013). Sudarmaji et al. (2019) developed and used time-based automatic irrigation systems for both drip and sprinkler irrigation, the system was found to apply water according to the set time times. Similarly, Montesano et al. (2016) compared time-based irrigation control with soil moisture-based control and reported low water use efficiency with 18% leaching compared to soil moisture-based control in a soil-less lettuce experiment. Since there is no soil moisture and weather monitoring in an open-loop system, sensors are not required. This makes the system inexpensive however with constraints of failing to respond to varying soil and environmental conditions. 4.2. Closed-loop irrigation control In closed-loop systems, a control strategy for irrigation decisions is developed. Having defined the strategy, the control system takes over and makes irrigation scheduling decisions (Boman et al., 2018). Sensors help to provide feedback to the controller on which the irrigation decisions are based. Feedback and control in a closed-loop system are done continuously and therefore, require data acquired by monitoring devices like soil moisture, air temperature, solar radiation, wind speed humidity, and rainfall as well as system parameters like pressure and flow. In closed-loop control, a decision of whether or not to initiate an action is based on a comparison between the current state of the system and the specified desired state (Boman et al., 2018). Fig. 6 is a schematic presentation of a closed-loop control system. Download : Download high-res image (62KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 6. Block diagram for an open-loop control system. Closed-loop control strategies are further subdivided into linear control, intelligent control, optimal control, and other control strategies as depicted in Fig. 5. 4.2.1. Linear control Linear control in closed-loop irrigation is further classified as linear quadratic control and Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control. Proportional integral derivative-based irrigation controllers have been widely used in irrigation research and other industrial applications because of their simplicity, low cost, and extensive control algorithm (Aguilar et al., 2015). “The principle of PID controller is to read a sensor, then compute the desired actuator output by calculating proportional, integral, and derivative responses and summing those three components to compute the output” (National Instruments Corperation, 2020c). Although PID controllers suffer setbacks when faced with external disturbances and non-linear systems, it is more efficient because of its control ability on the actual output of a process. Lacasta et al. (2014) implemented a decentralized feedback discrete PID controller integrated with the hydraulic model to achieve a reliable complete simulation tool for predictive purposes. The results showed that the PID controllers effectively captured the stochastic phenomena and provided the correct gate movements to obtain the desired water levels. Likewise, Arauz et al. (2020) designed a PI controller for irrigation canals based on linear matrix inequalities. The authors solved an Linear Matrix Inequalities-based optimal control problem to obtain sparse feedback that provided the PI tuning; the results indicated a 30% improvement in PID tuning and were able to satisfactorily control canal water levels. Azar et al. (2020) designed and manufactured a smart irrigation mobile robot with a soil moisture sensor. The authors introduced a simulation analysis of the designed smart irrigation mobile robot by using One-degree-of-freedom (1-DOF) PID controller. The results indicated that the smart irrigation mobile robot produced the desired output parameters. Nonetheless, classical closed loop controllers such as PID find it hard to control multi-variable and moving processes with time delays (Abioye et al., 2020a, Abioye et al., 2020b). Improving the controller performance requires linking feedback paths or cascading several PID controllers. Given the non-linearity of PIDs, there are inadequate gain selections of the control systems. Hybrid fuzzy PID is required for optimal control of irrigation systems. Tuning a PID requires the integration of intelligent algorithms such as hybrid fuzzy PID for optimal control of irrigation systems (Chao et al., 2019, Maghfiroh et al., 2020). 4.2.2. Artificial intelligence in closed-loop irrigation (Mccarthy, 2004) defined Artificial Intelligence (AI) as the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs. AI is an evolving technology in the agricultural domain. AI-based machines and systems, have taken today's agricultural production systems to a different level. This technology has enhanced crop production and improved real-time monitoring, harvesting, processing and irrigation, and marketing (Talaviya et al., 2020). AI has the capability of solving multivariate, non-linear, and time-variant complex problems affecting the irrigation system. AI algorithms can mimic the human decision-making process when applied to a certain problem domain. AI has been implemented in irrigation systems for adaptive decision-making processes in a form of ANN, fuzzy logic, and expert systems (Adeyemi et al., 2017). Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is a variation of the machine learning model that resembles the neural network of the human brain (Campos et al., 2020). While synapses connect the neurons in a human brain, in ANN, synapses are replaced by weights and biased connections. This helps to map the relationship between inputs and outputs (Campos et al., 2020). ANN-based controllers have learning and adaptation capabilities to the variable dynamics which makes them suitable for irrigation control systems (Abioye et al., 2020b). In recent years, various studies have explored the applicability of Artificial Neural Networks in irrigation scheduling. King et al. (2020) used ANN modelling to develop and evaluate data-driven models for predicting the reference canopy temperatures needed to compute crop water stress index for sugarbeet and wine grape. The data-driven models developed by the authors were able to estimate reference temperatures, enabled automated calculation of the crop-water-stress index for effective assessment of crop water stress. Adeyemi et al. (2018) modelled soil moisture content using Dynamic Neural Networks and reported significant water savings in an AQUACROP simulation of a potato growing season. Similarly, Karasekreter et al. (2013) registered 20.5% and 23.9% in water and energy savings when an ANN for scheduling with soil moisture and physical parameter inputs was implemented in a strawberry orchard. The major drawback with ANN systems is that large datasets for ANN model training are required. The accuracy of the ANN-based irrigation scheduling depends on how representative the data is of the physical system and thus data collection using precision instruments needs to be carefully undertaken. Fuzzy logic-based methodology focuses on decision making by allowing the expression of logical values between true and false and describes the uncertainty and non-linearity of real-world problems (Krishnan et al., 2020). “A fuzzy logic system is made up of a set used to classify input data into membership classes, a decision rule is applied to each set which culminates in a human-like decision output from the system” (Adeyemi et al., 2017). Fuzzy logic has been applied in irrigation control and has been recommended by researchers. For example, Mendes et al. (2019) developed a fuzzy inference system that decided when to increase or decrease the speed of the central pivot by considering the spatial variability of the field. The system was reported to work efficiently. Fuzzy irrigation controllers can accurately calculate the required amount of irrigation water and address the non-linearity associated with the process (Abioye et al., 2020b). Although Fuzzy Logic-based irrigation controllers have been reported by researchers as efficient, the accuracy and performance of the prediction entirely depend on the expertise of the designer about plant dynamics and fuzzy rule formulation. Another aspect of Artificial Intelligence in irrigation control is expert systems. An expert system is a computer program that uses artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to simulate the judgment and behavior of a human or an organization that has expert knowledge and experience in a particular field (Janjanam et al., 2021). Typically, an expert system incorporates a knowledge base containing accumulated experience and an inference or rules engine -- a set of rules for applying the knowledge base to each particular situation that is described to the program. The system's capabilities can be enhanced with additions to the knowledge base or to the set of rules. Current systems may include machine learning capabilities that allow them to improve their performance based on experience, just as humans do. An expert-controlled irrigation system aims to provide farmers with the expertise on how to determine the exact quantity of crop water needed at the right time, weather, and growing medium such as humidity, temperature, and soil types (Nada et al., 2014). Several researchers including (Eid and Abdrabbo (2018); Hazman (2015); Ragab et al. (2018); Shahzadi et al., 2016) have used expert systems for various applications in agriculture. The performance of an expert system is largely dependent on the effectiveness of the knowledge acquisition process. Process errors pose a great threat to expert systems reliability and performance. 4.2.3. Model predictive control Model Predictive Control (MPC) has its roots in optimal control. The principle of MPC is to use a dynamic model to forecast system behaviour and optimize the forecast to produce the best decision-the control move at the current time (Rawlings et al., 2018). Model predictive control is a very flexible optimal control framework based on solving constrained optimal control problems online repeatedly (Mao et al., 2018). MPC has been widely used in modern manufacturing industries due to its ability to handle multivariate processes and to address state and input constraints (Ding et al., 2018, Lozoya et al., 2014, Lozoya et al., 2016, Puig et al., 2012). In a control problem, the goal of the controller is to calculate the input to the plant such that the output follows the desired reference (Anon, 2018). MPC uses a model of the plant to make predictions about future plant output behaviour and an optimizer that ensures that the predicted future plant output tracks the desired reference (Anon, 2018).

Several researchers such as; Abioye et al. (2021); Ding et al. (2018); Lozoya et al. (2014); McCarthy et al. (2014); Puig et al. (2012); Saleem et al. (2013); and Zhang et al. (2015) have used Model Predictive Control strategies in irrigation scheduling in controlled environment agriculture. MPC has shown better performance in controlling air temperature in greenhouses compared to Proportional Integral Derivative control. However, the applications in irrigation are still minimal with many studies stopping at the simulation phase, and thus the impact on water use efficiency and water productivity is not known. More so, the MPC methods often used are Classical and Improved MPC. There is a need to evaluate stochastic and Hybrid MPC strategies for efficient irrigation scheduling in open-field agriculture. There are many uncertainties and unpredictable disturbances from the environment exist unlike in a greenhouse environment. A summary of irrigation control strategies as used in irrigation are presented in Table 2. Table 2. Irrigation control strategies used in recent studies.

Opportunities for improving water use efficiency in open field smart irrigation systems The need to improve water use efficiency in irrigated agriculture has gained serious attention from researchers in recent years. This is because agriculture has been reported to be a significant water user sector and yet spatiotemporal water scarcity indices are on the rise leaving little or no water for agricultural production. Producing more crop per drop requires that soil and weather parameters are precisely monitored and irrigation scheduled to meet the crop water demand. Commercial automated irrigation systems offered by major irrigation companies are programmed to irrigate at time intervals for predefined periods, and it is usually based on the user's empirical knowledge of crop needs, soil characteristics, and weather factors. Some farmers use either soil moisture-based scheduling or weather-based scheduling. These methods have been reported to save water. Consequently, closed-loop-based feedback control strategies have been proposed for smart irrigation as opposed to open-loop systems which are characterized by over and under irrigation. Several studies have developed process dynamics models on which closed-loop irrigation schedules are based (Delgoda et al., 2016, Ding et al., 2018, Goodchild et al., 2015; Lozoya et al., 2016; Lozoya et al., 2019; Saleem et al., 2013; Karasekreter et al., 2013; Ragab et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2015). The system dynamics estimated and formulated in these studies are based on the soil water balance model without capturing the dynamic nature of weather, soil characteristics, and plant water use. Capturing weather and plant water use dynamics ensures that all disturbances to the system are well incorporated in the algorithm which improves the accuracy. Therefore, there is a need to address this gap by developing a mathematical model that incorporates the dynamics of soil moisture content, weather, and crop growth parameters obtained from a combination of weather, soil, and plant sensors in open field experiments. A novel irrigation control strategy based on a hybrid model predictive control needs to be evaluated in an open field irrigation environment and the resulting water use efficiency and water productivity determined. 6. Conclusions In this manuscript, a review of smart irrigation monitoring and control strategies for improving water use efficiency in precision agriculture has been presented. The review has been developed around monitoring strategies for irrigation scheduling and irrigation control techniques. In addition, a discussion on opportunities for future research based on research gaps has been established. In this regard, it is concluded that a combination of weather-based, soil-based, and plant-based monitoring strategies coupled with a discrete model predictive control strategy needs to be studied in an open field environment. Unlike controlled environment agriculture research, open field agricultural irrigation systems are faced with uncertainties that need to be studied. Future research will thus focus on developing process dynamics models for irrigation scheduling and establishing the effects of smart monitoring and control strategies on water use efficiency and water productivity in open field agricultural systems.

Abstract The future of agriculture faces a threat from a changing climate and a rapidly growing population. This has put enormous pressure on water and land resources as more food is expected from less inputs. Advancement in smart agriculture through the use of the Internet of Things and improvement in computational power has enabled extensive data collection from agricultural ecosystems. This review introduces model predictive control and describes its application in precision irrigation. An overview of the application of data-driven modelling and model predictive control for precision irrigation management is presented. Model predictive control has been applied in irrigation canal control, irrigation scheduling, stem water potential regulation, soil moisture regulation and prediction of plant disturbances. Finally, the benefits, challenges, and future perspectives of data-driven model predictive control in the context of irrigation scheduling are presented. This review provides useful information to researchers and agriculturalists to appreciate and use data collected in real-time to learn the dynamics of agricultural systems.

Introduction The current and future generations face significant challenges in ensuring that nutritious food is sustainably produced from limited land and water resources. The FAO's food and agriculture report of 2020 posits that 40% of the world population are inhabitants of water-scarce agricultural areas; of these, 37% inhabit agricultural zones with severe water scarcity [27,51]. Coupled with the rising population indices, meeting the food demand by 2050 will need a 70% increase in food production [28]. In addition to developing quick maturing and high-yielding plant varieties, scientists need to ensure that less water is used to produce more food. It is estimated that about 70% of the water abstracted for irrigation is lost through conveyance losses and poor water allocation methods [76]. This means that a lot of water is presently used to produce a unit of food. Improving water use efficiency in irrigation systems requires intelligent irrigation monitoring and control systems to ensure that no water is wasted and precise water application is achieved [15]. Sustainable precision irrigation presents a timely solution to water wastage in irrigated agriculture by ensuring that intended irrigation amounts are applied at the right time and place. Precision irrigation scheduling is striving to achieve efficient water use per plant, in space and time, in the right quantities to compensate for losses. This is possible through effective monitoring and optimal control strategies, reducing pumping costs. Over the years, there has been a paradigm shift from traditional irrigation methods to smart irrigation systems. This has somewhat improved the water use efficiency by reducing conveyance losses. However, irrigation control is still a challenge due to the complex nature of agricultural systems. For example, most irrigation systems are designed based on historical climatic data, and irrigation schedules are developed based on this data. Precision agriculture has been facilitated by the tremendous advancement in the agricultural Internet of Things (IoT) and Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) through remote sensing [32,69]. The controlled monitoring of agricultural systems has enhanced the sapience of the changing dynamics of the water, plant and soil environment throughout the cropping season [5]. With advances in Big data analytics, more agricultural systems are becoming data-driven for decision-making purposes rather than relying on heuristic physics-based models [68]. Sustainable irrigation necessitates the adoption of irrigation control strategies that precisely direct irrigation water to the plant's root zone. Boman et al. [11] observed improved water, energy, and fertilizer use efficiency when precision irrigation control strategies are implemented. Precision irrigation control strategies are divided into two, namely, closed-loop systems and open-loop systems. Whereas open-loop systems apply a preset action like in simple irrigation timers, closed-loop systems receive feedback from sensors, make decisions and implement the resulting findings in the irrigation system [15]. Several authors have reviewed and classified closed-loop irrigation control strategies into three, namely, linear control, intelligent control and optimal control [4,15,23]. Model predictive control has evolved over the past four decades with advances in real-time data measurements and an increase in computational power. Model Predictive Control (MPC) refers to a category of advanced computer-controlled algorithms that use an explicit process model to predict a plant's future response [23]. Developed in the 1960s, Model Predictive Control emanates from optimal control. The basic principle of MPC is to use a dynamic model to predict system behavior and optimize the prediction to decide the control move at the current time [71]. In addition to its flexibility, Model predictive control repeatedly solves constrained optimal control problems online ([57]b). The ability to handle multivariate processes and address state and input constraints has made MPC indispensable in modern manufacturing industries [23,56,55,70]. In a control problem, the model predictive controller's goal is to compute the plant input to follow the desired reference [60]. MPC uses a plant model to predict future plant output behavior and an optimizer that ensures that the predicted plant output tracks the desired reference [15,60] MPC has been widely studied and applied in processing industries ([4,23,33]; F. [38,52]; L. [78]). However, in the agricultural sector, not much has been reported on the application of model predictive control in modelling dynamic agricultural systems. The most recent review by Ding et al. [23] focused on model predictive control applications in agriculture in general. [23] assert that the application of MPC to agriculture can yield significant productivity and efficiency benefits despite its limited use in the past years. However, no review of data-driven model predictive control in precision irrigation applications has been reported. MPC has been applied to agriculture, but it has not been applied in all respects. This work builds upon existing reviews in the field of agriculture with a particular focus on precision irrigation. This review presents an overview of model predictive control in section 2; data-driven MPC can be done through system identification, machine learning, and iterative learning control, as discussed in section 3. Section 4 presents the specific application domains of data-driven MPC in irrigation systems. The challenges and future perspectives of data-driven MPC are discussed in section 5. Finally, the conclusion and future research are presented. 2. Overview of model predictive control 2.1. Historical perspective of model predictive control The concept of model predictive control dates way back in the 1960s to 1970s [66]. However, MPC found its way into process industries until the 1980s [23]. Since then, model predictive control has undergone several stages of development. The first stage involves classical model predictive control between 1980 and 1990 and mainly solves multivariable constraint control problems [52]. As a result of the failure to handle nonlinear systems in process industries, improved MPCs evolved towards the end of the 20th century giving more computational power with an extraordinary ability to handle constraints. This phase saw the continued penetration of the commercial MPC algorithms into various industries and a sound theoretical foundation for it. In the 1st decade of the 21st century, latest MPC evolved as many industries adopted model predictive control [52]. The latest MPC methods reduced computation time by decentralizing large-scale problems, reducing computation time directly, or simplifying computational processes [23]. The fourth phase has seen the evolution of data-driven model predictive control techniques aided by machine learning and data science advancements. Table 1 summarizes the different types of MPC since 1980. Fig. 1 presents the evolution of model predictive control. Table 1. Historical perspective of model predictive control.

There has been a progression from the past decades in the category of systems where model predictive control is applied. Literature has reported a significant rise in MPC application in mechanical and electrical systems [52]. Some of the application domains include suspension [34], vehicle traction control [12], direct injection stratified charge engines [35], Grain drying processes [82], traffic management [48], automatic boats for aquaculture [81], modelling temperatures in buildings [25], amongst others. This is facilitated by the precedent developments, which enable MPC implementation on hardware, making it faster than traditional processes. 2.2. Main components of model predictive control The key to effective implementation of a control strategy is understanding how model predictive control works. Model predictive control has seven essential components (Fig. 2): prediction, receding horizon, modelling, performance index, degrees of freedom, constraint handling, and multivariable [73]. Download : Download high-res image (461KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Components of Model Predictive Control. Prediction: Model predictive control considers the future implication of current control actions by computing the predicted behavior over a horizon. Predictions must capture all the system's transient and steady-state behavior [73]. Therefore, the prediction horizon dictates how far the future state will be predicted. Receding horizon: This is the horizon over which system dynamics are predicted. After defining the optimal trajectory of the future state, the actual control input to the plant only takes the first sample of the control signal, neglecting the rest of the trajectory [78]. Modelling: Prediction of a system's future state requires a plant model. A good dynamic model will give a consistent and accurate prediction of the future. A mode of the system shows the dependence of the output on the current measured variable and the present/future inputs. Performance index: Performance index measures the numerical definition of the best input trajectory. Performance indices of a model change with time as the system's internal model gets better over time. Performance indices must therefore be realistic and matched with model accuracy. Degree of freedom: Degrees of freedom describe the complexity of input trajectories. Brownlee [13] defined degree of freedom as the sum of parameters in the model that are determined from data. This is inclusive of the coefficients of the model and the data used to calculate the error of the model. Constraint handling: Model predictive control embeds constraints into the strategy development. The proposed input trajectory is optimal while satisfying constraints. The systematic embedding of constraint information is critical to effective and robust closed-loop behavior. Multivariable: Almost all dynamic systems have numerous inputs and outputs. Model predictive control can handle multi-input-multi-output systems (MIMO) systematically. In traditional control like Proportional Integral Derivative (PID), it is complex to design MIMO systems because limited data about the plant is used in the model design, and interaction becomes cumbersome. On the other hand, model predictive control algorithms require a model and thus utilize more data, making it easier to handle MIMO systems. 2.3. Theoretical formulation of model predictive control A model predictive controller is designed based on the state space equation of the process dynamics model as described by Rawlings et al. [71]. A state-space model is a probabilistic graphical model that describes probabilistic dependence between the latent state variable and the observed measurement [16,20]. Model predictive control solves an optimal control problem over a receding horizon, subject to system constraints, to determine the next control action ([43], 2018). The optimization is iterated at each time step, and the control law is updated Fig. 3a . Kaiser et al. [44] formulates a receding horizon control problem as an open-loop optimization for every time step with an optimal sequence of control inputs u (Fig. 3b ) (1) ≔ Download : Download high-res image (347KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Schematic of model predictive control with a moving horizon window. Adapted from [14]. Over the control horizon given the current measurement that minimizes a cost over the prediction horizon , where is the timestep of the model. The control horizon is less than or equal to the prediction horizon such that then the input u is assumed constant after that. The first control value is then applied and the optimization is reinitialized and repeated at each subsequent timestep to solve for the unknown sequence . This results in an implicit feedback control law. (2) The cost optimization at each timestep is described as minimizing a performance index with up to three terms; an output penalty, an input penalty, and an input rate penalty; (3) The minimized cost function J is subject to constraints on the inputs and outputs; (4) 2.4. Data-driven model predictive control Data-driven control systems are broadly classified under control systems. The identification of the process model and the design of the controller are based entirely on experimental data collected from the plant [9]. Learning dynamical systems models from data is a vital challenge in mathematical physics, with a rich history dating back as far as the time of Kepler and Newton and the discovery of the laws of planetary motion. Initially, modelling of dynamic systems relied on a combination of high-quality measurements and expert intuition. With vast data and increasing computational power, the automated discovery of governing equations and dynamical systems is a new and exciting scientific paradigm. Data-driven models require automatic data collection, as they can react in real-time to changes in the input variables [31]. The data-driven models’ response can create a feedback loop into a larger online system. However, automatic data collection is associated with some challenges, and thus, characteristics of big data, namely, volume, velocity, variety, value and veracity (5Vs), need to be considered (Fig. 4).

System identification System identification is a form of machine learning, where an input-output map of a system is learned from training data in a representation that generalizes the data that was not in the training set [14]. Ljung [53] defined it as the art and science of building mathematical models of dynamic systems from observed input-output data. System identification is essential where first principles or physics-based modelling of the system is not possible. Here, nothing is known about the system dynamics, also known as the black-box approach. Data is used to learn a mathematic model that mimics the input-output relationship using a model structure that represents the system behavior and parameter selection for fitting the data. A better understanding of the model is achieved with system identification, and future prediction becomes easy. Fig. 5 represents a flowchart for a system identification process Download : Download high-res image (178KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. System identification process. System identification can be done for linear systems, nonlinear systems and online and recursive systems. 3.1. Nonlinear system identification for control Powerful model-based control techniques like linear optimal control and model predictive control are aided by data-driven techniques that characterize the input-output dynamics from observed measurements without relying on first principles modelling. Nonlinear systems identification is made possible due to high computing power and powerful data-driven techniques. Once a low order model of the input-output dynamics from actuation u to measurements y and a full state x of the system is measured, then identification of dynamics f is made possible that satisfy (5) This then is discretized since data is collected in time steps and control laws are digitally implemented. This state dynamics then becomes. (6) 3.2. Online and recursive system identification Online systems identification means that the algorithm is running during the operation of the physical system. Online system identification algorithms estimate the parameters and states of a system model as data is obtained in real-time or near real-time from measuring devices [24]. Referring to the agro-hydrologic balance equation, the process dynamics of the system can be described as one with three inputs, rainfall, irrigation, and crop evapotranspiration and one output, soil moisture, as shown in Fig. 6. The process dynamics model assumes that deep percolation in an irrigated agricultural system is proportional to soil moisture.

The soil moisture dynamics of the system can be denoted as (7) Where; Euler approximation theory is used on the soil moisture variations to create a discrete model for the soil moisture. (8) Where is the sampling interval The discrete-time dynamics then can be written as, (9) Where; is the crop coefficient and varies according to the crop growth stage. A soil model can be developed over time by updating the model parameters each time step. For example, the algorithm could measure irrigation and compare it with the predicted irrigation amount to produce a prediction error. An online algorithm adjusts the model parameters to reduce the error. In the next step, a new set of measurements is recorded and compared with the model prediction. An error is again obtained and added to the old measurements and the process repeats itself. Online system identification is crucial where the model parameters are time-variant, especially as is the case for the weather parameters in the crop evapotranspiration model. 4. Machine learning control Machine learning is a rapidly developing field transforming our ability to learn and characterize dynamic systems [14]. Machine learning makes the control of complex, nonlinear systems possible because of its high dimensional, nonlinear and optimization techniques [26]. For example, given a schematic in Fig. 7 with high dimensional dynamics with external disturbances to achieve a high-level objective function. Download : Download high-res image (173KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 7. Schematic of machine learning control. The objective is to design a controller based on sensor measurements of the system that can then drive the system through actuation. Examples of machine learning methods include genetic algorithms, genetic programming, reinforcement learning and adaptive neural networks (Fig. 8). These machine learning algorithms use biological principles like neural networks, evolutional algorithms, and reinforcement learning. Detailed information on machine learning control can be found in ([8,14,26] and [64]) Download : Download high-res image (618KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 8. Sub-divisions of machine learning control. 5. Iterative learning control Iterative learning control (ILC) is an efficient technique used to improve the performance of transient systems that operate repetitively [79]. The aim of ILC is to improve the transient response through input adjustment based on observed errors. A standard iterative learning control scheme assumes stable dynamics, and the system returns to the same initial conditions at the start of each trial of the same length. A schematic of data-driven iterative learning control is presented in Fig. 9 [65]. Download : Download high-res image (249KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 9. Iterative learning control process. An Iterative Learning Control takes the form (10) Where;  = input to the system during the kth repetition,  = tracking error during the kth repetition and  = design parameter representing operations on  . There has to be a convergence of the input signals as k becomes large. This will ensure perfect tracking through the iteration process. The rate of convergence represents the desirable need for a rapid iterative learning process. Despite the uncertainty about the process dynamics, good algorithm performance is desirable. The operation   ranges from simple scalar gains to sophisticated optimization computations and is necessary to achieve design objectives. 5.1. Applications of data-driven model predictive control in precision irrigation management Owing to the similarity of agricultural processes to industrial processes, model predictive control has been applied in product processing, agricultural production, greenhouses and irrigation systems [23]. For example, model predictive control has been applied in canal flow control and regulation, irrigation scheduling, stem water potential regulation, soil moisture regulation and precipitation and evapotranspiration prediction. 5.2. Irrigation canal flow control and regulation Model predictive control has found applicability to canal flow control and gate operation. The management objective of MPC for irrigation canals is to keep the water levels as close to the setpoints as possible [45]. Therefore, a suitable model representing the canal water level dynamic is needed. Furthermore, the models need to be set up in such a way that they contain the appropriate dynamics of the water system for water level regulation. In this regard, MPC has been applied to model the behavior of the water movement in the open channel, maintaining certain water levels at various locations and the water flows that influence these water levels [29,30,63,79,80,84]. Control structures are used to manipulate the water flows, through which the controller can achieve the management objective [45]. However, achieving this objective is not straightforward, as some varying inflows and outflows disturb the water system. To predict the future water levels and flows as a result of disturbances and control actions, the water system (canal reaches, structures, disturbances, controller) needs to be modelled. Fig. 10 depicts a typical irrigation canal with water flowing by gravity and different offtakes along the canal reach.

(11) and (12) accurately describe the water flow dynamics in the irrigation canal. (11) (12) Where; y is the depth of water in m, T the top width of the canal at the water surface in m, Q is the water flow rate in the canal m3/s, x is the longitudinal distance on the flow direction in m, q the lateral outflow per unit length of the channel in m2/s, v the velocity in m/s, A is the wetted cross-sectional area, g the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s2), so the channel bottom slope and sf is the friction slip of the irrigation canal. Several scholars have used model predictive control in controlling irrigation canal flows. Puig et al. [70] used model predictive control to generate flow control strategies from the water source to the consumer and irrigation areas in the Guadiana River. The results showed effectiveness in the use of model predictive control. Zhang et al. [83] designed a non-cooperative distributed model predictive control algorithm based on Nash optimality for water level regulation in irrigation canals. The system simulation results showed the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. To effectively deliver canal flow without fluctuations, Han & Qiao [39]; Hashemy et al. [41,40]combined model predictive control with online water storage to compensate for an existing time delay and avoid wave disturbances. The results showed significant improvement for canal operations employing automation. Recently, Kong et al. [50] used model predictive control toolbox to control gate interval and water level. The authors tested it on a simulation model of an irrigation canal in Beijing consisting of 13 cascaded canal pools. The authors affirmed that model predictive control is a useful control strategy for gate opening at different intervals [49]. 6. Irrigation scheduling Irrigation scheduling is the process of determining the frequency, duration and quantity of irrigation water to apply to meet the crop water requirements [59]. In conventional irrigation systems, irrigation scheduling is determined through experience, observation, and heuristic methods. On the other hand, precision irrigation systems rely on feedback from sensing devices. Irrigation scheduling can be achieved through weather-based, soil-based, or plant-based approaches. Precision irrigation systems aim at spatio-temporal irrigation scheduling depending on weather, soil, and plant physiological characteristics [3]. Model predictive control is used to perform irrigation scheduling using real-time field data to calibrate a crop and soil model and then using the calibrated model to determine optimum irrigation schedules [61]. Plant and soil real-time measurements are crucial to calibrate the model during the growing stages of the crop as irrigation advances. Considering the soil moisture balance model, the plant input is the irrigation amount, whereas the plant output is the soil moisture deficit. The crop evapotranspiration and precipitation values are considered disturbances as they cannot be controlled. Delgoda et al. [22], Lozoya et al. [56], and Saleem et al. [74] used model predictive control to predict the frequency, duration and quantity of irrigation water using a soil moisture dynamics model. The authors used a combined mechanistic and data-driven modelling approach to describe the dynamics of the soil-plant-atmosphere system using sensing devices for real-time feedback to the control algorithm. However, the authors neglected the effect of precipitation and crop water use on the system dynamics. Delgoda et al. [21] addressed the drawbacks noted in the above model predictive control framework. The authors employed a disturbance affine feedback control approach and uncertainty modelling techniques to account for the dynamic nature of rainfall and crop water use. Moreover, the study reported optimal system performance in a humid region where considerable uncertainties in climate variables existed. Recently, Abioye, Abidin, Aman, et al. [2] and Abioye, Abidin, Mahmud, et al. [2] used a data-driven model predictive control to schedule irrigation in a greenhouse irrigation experiment. The authors used Laguerre functions in order to reduce the computation complexity brought about by input constraints. 6.1. Stem water potential regulation Another important aspect in precision irrigation management is the soil water potential. It determines the ease with which plants can extract water from the soil. Soil water potential is a measure of the energy status of the soil water relative to that of water at a standard reference [59]. On the other hand, stem water potential (SWP) is the direct measure of water tension within the plant [75]. Suter et al. suggested that plant moisture status needs to be determined through SWP measurements rather than the soil moisture content. Chen et al. [18] developed a stem water potential model using data-driven model predictive control to help reduce uncertainty in weather forecast errors. The authors formulated a state-space model that captures water dynamics in a plant-root-soil system. The water status of the system was modelled by monitoring water flow in the soil, root and plant system. Precipitation in the system was the water inflow, and evapotranspiration was the driving force in the system. The state-space model was linearized to reduce the computation burden caused by robust nonlinear optimization. The authors used the formulation of a robust optimal control problem that maintained stem water potential within certain limits. The authors reported a 7.9% reduction in the water consumption in almond trees using data-driven robust model predictive control. 6.2. Soil moisture regulation Irrigation aims to maintain the root zone soil moisture between field capacity and the permanent wilting point (Fig. 10). When the soil moisture goes above the field capacity, the soil becomes saturated, and below the wilting point, the plant experiences water stress and eventually dies. Management allowable depletion of 50% is adopted for most irrigation designs to ensure that the available moisture does not get depleted before irrigation occurs. This available moisture in the root zone depends on the plant's effective root zone. Model predictive control has been used to minimize root zone soil moisture and irrigation amounts within a specific threshold or at specific set points [22,55,62]. However, recent studies argue that a zone needs to be considered rather than a reference set point to ensure maximum water extraction from the root zone. The aim should be to regulate the soil moisture within the readily available moisture zone. Mao et al. [57c] proposed a methodical approach to system identification and root zone model predictive control design for soil moisture control of agro-hydrological systems. First, the authors simulated the soil water dynamics of the field from a mechanistic soil-water balance model. The model consisted of a nonlinear partial differential equation with source and sink terms characterizing the root water extraction, evaporation and transpiration, precipitation, and irrigation. A linear parameter varying model was identified based on the input and output data of the soil-water balance model, which was then used for zone model predictive control design. The authors report a satisfactory approximation of the soil moisture dynamics and the designed zone model predictive control suitability. 6.3. Precipitation and evapotranspiration prediction One of the challenges in precision irrigation management is the scarcity of climate data. Precision irrigation requires real-time data to aid in irrigation decisions. In developed countries, prediction systems are used to predict future weather events, and this data is availed to farmers for irrigation management decisions. In the absence of such, there is a need to bridge the gap using model predictive control to quantity the sources of uncertainty in the soil moisture dynamics model. To address this, Guo and You [37] used a novel data-driven local precipitation and evapotranspiration prediction by implementing an artificial neuro-network (ANN). It was embedded in the model predictive control toolbox and updated in real-time to formulate the dynamic uncertainty set to account for weather prediction errors in the irrigation control system. The authors reported effective control of the root zone soil moisture. A summary of studies conducted in the different application domains is presented in Table 2. Table 2. Summary of applications of MPC in irrigation. Application Domain Author Irrigation Canal control ([6,17,30,54,80]; R. [83,84,86]) Irrigation scheduling [1,2,16,37,46,55,67] Soil moisture regulation ([7,57]c, [57,58] Soil water potential regulation ([19], 2021; [75]) Prediction of Precipitation and Evapotranspiration [37] 6.4. Challenges and future perspectives of data-driven modelling in smart irrigation Data collection that is representative of the real dynamic system is challenging. When more data is provided, machine learning can be used in data-driven modelling to fit data and make predictions when more data is required. Some of the challenges encountered in data collection are discussed in this section. One of the major challenges affecting precision irrigation is the high cost of obtaining data in irrigation systems. To develop a data-driven model for smart irrigation, data about the soil, plant, and environment need to be monitored. Plant sensors need to monitor the physiological processes in plant-like crop water use. The different growth stages and their effect on the crop factors need to be established. The climatic factors that affect the rate of evapotranspiration need to be monitored in real-time, otherwise relying on historical data that is not representative of the real system. The data collection strategies and control methods are discussed in [4,15]. The challenges relating to data availability range from sampling frequency, incomplete data, sensor malfunction, working conditions, communication exceptions or database shutdown. This can affect the integrity of the experimental dataset collected, thereby resulting in poor model development. In addition, developing models from data requires capturing a large volume of data to represent the real systems and capture any variations. For example, in irrigation, the components of the agro-hydrological model vary from time to time. This variation must be captured, which makes the data collection process time-consuming. This may involve monitoring the dynamics for the entire season or year to get a representative model for the dynamics. Predictions are a key feature of data-driven models for irrigation optimization and intelligent decision-making. System boundaries define the capability of data-driven models. If the data is only a subsection of the field, the model may fail to make accurate predictions for an entire irrigation field. Therefore, it is pertinent to define the system boundaries and ensure model data development extends to the boundaries ensuring that only predictions made from the model boundaries are acted upon. The application of model predictive control in irrigation is still limited compared to processing industries. Large water and irrigation systems must reduce computation times and now incorporate data-driven model predictive control. In the future, there's a need to model soil moisture dynamics in open field agricultural systems as past studies stopped at simulation or implemented in a controlled environment agricultural system where disturbances to the model are minimized. Model predictive control can be applied to diverse aspects of precision agriculture to enhance agricultural productivity in the future. These application domains include aquaponics, hydroponics, viticulture, controlled environment agriculture, aquaculture, disease and pest control, and mechanization systems. 7. Conclusion Data-driven modelling in agriculture is on the rise due to the advancement of Internet of Things technologies and improved computational power. This article presents an overview of model predictive control over the past four decades, and data-driven model predictive control is discussed. From the review, model predictive control has been used in precision irrigation management, ranging from irrigation canal control, irrigation scheduling, stem water potential regulation, soil moisture regulation, and precipitation prediction and evapotranspiration. It is noted that for data-driven MPC to solve complex dynamic systems in irrigation, the availability of data, variability, boundary conditions and model evaluation must be harmonized for one to come up with a good representative model of the system. There is more research opportunity to explore on the application of data-driven modelling and controller development for predictive irrigation management. 8.

Abstract The demand for freshwater is on the increase due to the rapid growth in the world’s population while the effect of global warming and climate change cause severe threat to water use and food security. Consequently, irrigation systems are tremendously utilized by many farmers all over the world with its associated high amount of water consumption from various sources posing a major concern. This necessitates the increased focus on improving the efficiency of water usage in irrigation agriculture. The advent and rapid successes of the Internet of Things (IoT) and advanced control strategies are being leveraged to achieve improved monitoring and control of irrigation farming. In this review, a thorough search for literature on irrigation monitoring and advanced control systems highlighting the research works within the past ten years are presented. Attention is paid on recent research works related to the monitoring and advance control concepts for precision irrigation. It is expected that this review paper will serve as a useful reference to enhance reader’s knowledge on monitoring and advanced control opportunities related to irrigation agriculture as well as assist researchers in identifying directions and gaps to future research works in this field.

Introduction Agriculture serves as a significant source of food production and job creation to the growing demand of the human population all over the world upon which most economies survive. It is also part of the key economic sector, significantly contributing to the gross domestic product (GDP) of most countries. The success of this crucial sector relies absolutely on water supplies as crop cultivation naturally thrives on the availability of water. However, the scarcity of freshwater poses significant threats to food security and sustainable developments in some parts of the world. Therefore, efficient use and conservation of water for irrigation is needed to increase food production while equally preventing water scarcity crises (Tsang and Jim, 2016). Rainfall and irrigation are significant sources of water for agriculture. Rainfall is unreliable, and moreover, excess supplies may cause some undesirous effects on crops such as surface runoff and, erosion while it scarcity may even cause drought. Consequently, a controlled system of watering the farm, irrigation, is highly practiced for crop cultivation as an alternative to a natural rainfall water source for plants. The irrigation system is an essential agricultural practice where water is artificially applied to the soil to supply a controlled amount of water necessary for plant growth and development (Oborkhale et al., 2015; Shibusawa, 2001). In a conventional irrigation system, farmers apply uniform irrigation across every part of the farm without considering the variabilities on the field and the water need of the crop. Therefore, this method has lesser water-saving capability and can cause over-irrigation in some part of the farm while other parts are under irrigated which may lead to undesired water stress on the plants (Anusha et al., 2017, Kumar et al., 2017, Lakhiar et al., 2018, Say et al., 2018). Also, most of the commercial irrigation controllers available in the market are pre-programmed to supply water at predefined intervals, which offer offline irrigation scheduling based on empirical knowledge of dynamics of weather variables, as well as soil and plant characteristics (Lozoya et al., 2014). Other issues in irrigation systems involve scarcity of water due to the effect of drought and climate change, environmental disturbance, the nonlinear nature of plant dynamics, changing dynamics of weather, dynamic crop water uptake of plants (Yusuke, 2018). To address these issues, precision irrigation concept for optimal water-saving and better yield is adopted. Precision irrigation is the integration of information, communication, and control technologies in the irrigation process to obtain optimal usage of water resources while minimizing environmental impact (Shibusawa, 2001, Zacepins et al., 2012). Precision irrigation takes into account the spatial and temporal soil variation, soil structure and hydraulic properties, plant responses to water deficit, changing weather variables through effective monitoring via Internet of Things (IoT), to make better irrigation decisions that have the potential to help achieve high water saving and improved yield (Bitella et al., 2014, Capraro et al., 2018, Zhang et al., 2002). It has been argued that this variability can be managed and economic benefit can be derived by meeting the specific irrigation needs of individual crops and their management zones through precision irrigation approach (Cambra et al., 2018, Chami et al., 2019, Smith et al., 2009). Precision irrigation is an excellent water-saving technique for maximizing yield and providing water at the desired location based on the water needs of the plant (Niu et al., 2015; Evett et al., 2009; Smith and Baillie, 2009). Also implied is the idea that the system will be managed to achieve a specific target by aiding the delivery of nutrients and water directly to the roots of each plant. This keeps the soil moisture at optimal levels to eliminate surface run-off, and deep percolation as the design process is conducted based on the ability of the soil to absorb water and the amount of crop water demand (Daccache et al., 2015). Therefore, this method results in increased productivity and improved quality of yield while ensuring maximum water use efficiency (Tropea, 2014, Smith et al., 2010). However, to provide efficient precision irrigation, the integration of the IoT for data acquisition as well as monitoring, control theory, and decision support technologies must be considered in irrigation management (Pham and Stack, 2018, Zamora-izquierdo et al., 2018). In the context of precision irrigation, control is the ability to reallocate inputs and adjustment of irrigation management according to the crop response deficit while ensuring optimal water-saving and mitigating the effects of disturbance and uncertainties (De Baerdemaeker, 2000, Smith and Baillie, 2009). However, in all cases, there is a need to sense the response of plants to the applied water at a scale appropriate for management as well as deciding for improved irrigation using both real-time and historical information for subsequent irrigation applications at an appropriate spatial level (Shashi et al., 2017). This process requires the application of real-time monitoring and advanced control strategies. In control theory, advanced control strategies refer to a broad range of techniques and technologies implemented within a process and industrial control system, while control theory is referred to as a subfield of electrical engineering and mathematics, which deals with the dynamical behaviour of systems. The attainment of desired dynamical behaviours defines the precision of the output and is determined by the model of the input and the controlled parameters. In precision irrigation, plant properties and weather parameters are relied upon with the use of sensors and several models to provide desired control of irrigation. Several review articles have been published which are related to precision agriculture, as seen in Semananda et al., 2018, Pierpaoli et al., 2013. In addition, review work on the opportunities in IoT monitoring and how the combination of IoT, big data and data analytics has enabled precision and sustainable agriculture has been discussed (Khanna Abhishek, 2019, Dlodlo and Josephat, 2015, Elijah et al., 2018b, Kamilaris et al., 2017, Martín et al., 2017, Wolfert et al., 2017, Munoth et al., 2016). Also, a review by Ding et al. (2018), described the development of a predictive model for control in agriculture, its challenges and future perspective. While a review of optimization methods and performance evaluation of irrigation projects was carried out by Aliyev, 2018, Elshaikh et al., 2018. Presently, there is no review paper combining both monitoring and control strategies for precision irrigation systems, hence necessitating the need for a critical review on precision irrigation with the integration of all the monitoring and control techniques used for water-saving agriculture. Therefore, this paper discusses advanced control and monitoring strategies for precision irrigation system with the integration of irrigation monitoring methods. The control techniques presented in this paper are basically classified into an open and closed-loop control system. The goal is to sort out and abridge a reasonable part of previous research work and further recognize and identify the research trends for precision irrigation control systems. Next, Section 2 discusses the review methodology, and Section 3 discusses the different methods of irrigation systems, while irrigation monitoring based on the Internet of Things is discussed in Section 4. Section 5 explains the integration of advanced control strategies to enhance the precision irrigation system, while the last section discusses the future research direction and conclusion. 2. Review methodology The methodology applied in the selection of works of literature that are published on precision irrigation and all its existing control strategies includes an extensive search through a different multidisciplinary online database, such as Science Direct, IEEE Xplore, Springer, Wiley, Taylor & Francis, MDPI, Google Scholar, and other Scopus indexed journals, etc. In such enormous research libraries, numerous research articles related to monitoring and control in irrigation were found.

Classification of irrigation methods For an impressive plant growth and development, appropriate water supply is essential. When rainfall is inadequate, water must be supplied to crops through irrigation (Brouwer et al., 1990b). Different irrigation methods that can be used to provide water to plant is shown in Fig. 4. The irrigation types are categorized into traditional and modern techniques based on their tendency to offer water saving, be precisely monitored, scheduled, and controlled. The quantity of irrigation water to be applied to any plant depends on the method of the irrigation system adopted, plant water demand, and the soil type. Any of the adopted irrigation methods will have an influence on the nutrients, infiltration rate, evaporation rate, water absorption pattern, and deep percolation of the soil. Download : Download high-res image (390KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Different methods of irrigation. The traditional surface irrigation methods which is classified in Fig. 4, applies and distributes water to the surface of the soil based on the gravity flow without any form of sensing and control action (Ghodake and Mulani, 2016). The traditional surface irrigation type is the oldest and most common irrigation method, which was practiced all over the world (Yonts, 1994). Examples of the traditional surface irrigation methods such as furrow, flooding, and manual watering are commonly used by peasant farmers. However, these methods require good soil surface levelling to ensure adequate water distribution to prevent the water applied from draining away (Zhang et al., 2004). In addition, the water-saving capacity of these methods is low due to the potential losses of water, which is due to the massive evaporation process and uncontrolled irrigation volume (Gillies, 2017). Traditional surface irrigation is characterised by excessive water supplied to the plants which often leads to surface runoff, deep percolation, which increases the tendency of leaching, reduces the soil nutrients level, and results in reduced crop yield (Adamala et al., 2014). Therefore, surface irrigation can be enhanced to achieve precision irrigation through the adoption of modern water saving technology as well as the needed monitoring and control strategies to increase its water usage efficiency (Koech et al., 2010). In modern water saving methods, which are classified as subsurface (capillary) and surface (drip or sprinkler irrigation). Many studies have investigated subsurface irrigation and found out that it offers higher water-saving and better yield output when compared with other types surface of irrigation (Nalliah and Sri Ranjan, 2010, Li et al., 2018, Ohaba et al., 2015, Shukri et al., 2014, Shukri et al., 2014, Shukri Bin Zainal Abidin et al., 2012). Subsurface capillary irrigation is a type of subsurface irrigation that works based on the action of gradually supplying water from a source directly to the root area by using a capillary medium. Some capillary mediums which were usually used in this method are wicks, mats, ebbs, porous ceramics, and flows (Semananda et al., 2018, Cai, 2017, Wesonga et al., 2014). In the application of the subsurface irrigation method, Rahman et al. (2019) proposed the horizontal and vertical fibrous capillary interface to transfer water from the supply tank to the root zone of the plant. The subsurface capillary irrigation process works based on a negative pressure to transport water using the capillary interface to the root zone of the plant. Based on the results obtained from both references, it has been shown that the horizontal type interface offers higher water saving potential and the better yield on their test crop compared to the vertical type interface. Other research works on capillary irrigation have also proven the advantage of this method to provide higher water saving in performing irrigation process in agriculture compared to other methods (Kamal et al., 2019, Ferrarezi, 2016, Kinoshita et al., 2010, Masuda, 2008). However, Fujimaki et al. (2018) have observed that the upward movement action of water via capillary can irreversibly accumulate salts in the plant growing medium, thereby increasing the salinity of the soil, which can be reduced only when water leaching occurs in the medium. Therefore, an efficient monitoring and control system for the capillary irrigation method is needed to overcome the soil salinity problem. Surface drip irrigation is one of the modern water saving irrigation methods which supplies water slowly through narrow tubes to provide water to the soil near the plant roots (Brouwer et al., 1990a). This irrigation method reduces the rate of water loss, which occurs due to evaporation that was affected by wind and surface runoff (Pramanik et al., 2016, Bhalage et al., 2015, Rekha et al., 2015). Likewise, Elasbah et al. (2019) have claimed the effectiveness of a drip irrigation method to offer an efficient irrigation system by providing the precise amount of nutrients to the plants to reduce the amount of nutrient leaching. However, to design and manage a surface drip irrigation system, proper knowledge regarding water distribution wetting patterns, spacing between emitters/dripper are needed to avoid a higher amount of water loss due to the evaporation process on the soil surface and water use efficiency (Bajpai and Kaushal, 2020, Hou et al., 2015). Despite several advantages of drip irrigation method, it suffers from a high setup cost, especially for a more massive farm due to various accessory requirements needed to perform the irrigation process such as pipes, head trickles, and emitters (Bralts and Edwards, 1987). Also, regular maintenance for the emitters is required to avoid any blockage that might affect the water supplied to the plant (Ravina et al., 1992). Sprinkler irrigation is another type of modern irrigation method similar to the pattern of precipitation on the plant. The water sprinkling process is performed by using the spray head and extensive piping system to ensure a large coverage area for irrigation. There are several types of sprinkler irrigation methods, such as the centre pivot, standalone, linear, and lateral move sprinkler, as contained in Fig. 4. This method tends to irrigate a larger land area due to its broader irrigation coverage, as demonstrated in (Evans et al., 2012, Evans and King, 2012). However, this method suffers from a high operating cost as it requires several accessories such as sprinkler head, high-pressure pump, pipes, and energy supplies for the water pump system such as engine oil and electricity. In addition, sprinkler irrigation is found to be inadequate to be applied in a windy environment due to a high water loss rate as a result of wind drift and evaporation (Xingye et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2009). Furthermore, this method also requires regular maintenance for nozzle replacement, and pipe connections need to be regularly checked as leakage in pipe connections will reduce the water sprinkling uniformity throughout the farm, thus affecting the crop productivity. Whatever method of irrigation adopted, subsurface, drip, or sprinkler irrigation, there is a necessity to consider improvising for its shortcoming by real-time monitoring and advanced control design aimed at achieving enhanced and desired precision. This is done by the application of relevant sensing devices to measure controlled parameters. The next section outlines the monitoring techniques adopted in literature. 4. Monitoring in precision irrigation Efficient monitoring system for various parameters that affect the plant growth and development is very vital towards designing an efficient irrigation control system to improve food production with minimum water loss. Monitoring in the context of precision irrigation also involves the collection of data that accurately reflects the real-time status of soil, plant, and weather of the irrigation areas of the plants through the use of wireless sensor networks (WSN) and the Internet of Things (IoT) technology. To develop a real-time monitoring system, the IoT has paved its way for the use of low-cost hardware (sensors/actuators) and communication technologies (Internet) to enhance the monitoring and control system for the irrigation process (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018). Similarly, distributed WSN nodes also play a significant role in real-time monitoring for precision farming. They are a network of sensor nodes interconnected wirelessly to sense, compute, and transmit information of various parameters and designed for large scale and long term deployment (Hamouda, 2017). The implementation of IoT to monitor essential parameters in precision irrigation has become a trend where seamlessly connected sensors, cameras, and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV), drones as well as satellites for data acquisition and onward data transmission using cloud service platform is used as illustrated in Fig. 5 (Karim et al., 2017, Dubravko Ćulibrk et al., 2014). Download : Download high-res image (292KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Overview of IoT- based Monitoring Architecture. The cloud platform offers services such as data analysis of sensor monitored parameters for decision making, visualization, and actions (Rajeswari et al., 2017). Farmers and researchers can remotely access the IoT cloud server where the control and monitoring algorithms are deployed using smartphones or fixed devices to provide better insights and to enhance the decision-making process in real-time (Jayaraman et al., 2016, Pongnumkul et al., 2015). Thus, the monitoring process for soils, crops and weather parameters will become more efficient and convenient for farmers, which will further enhance the effectiveness of precision irrigation control system and to ensure a good quality food production (Andrew et al., 2018, Kushwaha et al., 2015, Mohanraj et al., 2016, O’Grady and O’Hare, 2017, Rajeswari et al., 2017, Saiful et al., 2020, Uddin et al., 2017). As seen in Fig. 5, IoT and WSN are essential aspects that enhance monitoring process in agriculture as well as the use of other different sensors, where sensed parameters can be transferred through different wireless communication technologies such as ZigBee, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi wireless protocol, and GPRS/3G/4G Technology. Also, Low Power Wide Area (LWPA) wireless technologies like LoRa, LTE Cat-NB1, Sigfox, and LTE Cat M1 have also been used for wide area coverage monitoring (Elijah et al., 2018a, Jawad et al., 2017, Li et al., 2017, Ramesh and Rangan, 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017, Lin et al., 2015, Bitella et al., 2014). Some of the essential parameters that are usually monitored and considered for the design of a precision irrigation control systems are shown in Table 1, while the highlight of the various monitoring and sensing methods towards the achievement of precision irrigation are discussed under the soil, weather and plant-based monitoring as discussed in Sections 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3.

Soil-based monitoring Soil moisture is one of the most crucial parameters needed for plant growth. High spatiotemporal monitoring of soil moisture content is necessary towards ensuring optimal irrigation scheduling. Several IoT-based soil moisture monitoring for irrigation management using Raspberry Pi and Arduino prototyping board. This is interfaced with different sensors for real-time soil moisture fluxes for monitoring of crop water use for irrigation decision and scheduling (Divya, 2019; Rao and Sridhar, 2018; Krishna, 2017; Anusha et al., 2017; Rajalakshmi and Devi, 2016; Chate and Rana, 2016; Kothawade et al., 2016). The type of soil moisture sensing used is a low-cost capacitance-based type that is based on the dielectric device working principle. According to Shigeta et al. (2018), real-time soil moisture sensing using capacitance-based sensors is applicable for practical measurement of soil moistures fluxes by correlating the volumetric water content (VWC) of the soil and the capacitance of the sensor probes inserted in the soil with reasonable accuracy. A more accurate soil moisture sensing approach can be achieved using a time domain reflectometry (TDR) sensors which comprises of two parallel rods inserted to the soil at the depth at which the moisture content is desired. An electromagnetic pulse is radiated from the sensor rod, from which the rate at which the pulse is conducted into the soil and reflected back to the soil surface is directly related to the soil moisture content. However, a high sampling rate is required for the TDR soil moisture sensors to receive a good signal reflected from the soil hence, making this type of sensor very expensive for farmers to deploy at a large scale for soil moisture monitoring. A low-cost monitoring irrigation system was proposed by Bitella et al. (2014) for multisensory measurement of soil water content at different depths, soil, and air temperatures. The soil sensor probes used for monitoring the soil water content are the dielectric probe operating with a sensing frequency of 80 MHz. The sensors were interfaced with Arduino Uno microcontroller as an analog input while the Wi-Fi module ESP8266 was used to transmit the data to the internet for data logging. Related work using Node MCU was carried out by (Chieochan et al., 2017; Kumar et al., 2017). Similarly, an IoT-based field monitoring was implemented with a cloud base monitoring and data analysis using Arduino as a controller by (Jha et al., 2017, Salvi, 2017, Yashaswini et al., 2017). Their findings confirmed that the collected data was used to make a prediction that was used to achieve reduced water consumption and for planning the strategies to get better crop yield. An IoT soil moisture monitoring approach by Hebbar and Golla (2017), took advantage of the wireless networks that utilized GSM network and infrared communications to offer automatic water supply for plants for water-saving. The proposed system was controlled by PIC microcontroller 16F877A to turn the ON/OFF pump using a relay driver after checking the moisture level with the help of a capacitance-based soil moisture sensor consisting of two electrodes gauging the resistance of the soil. Also, a soil moisture monitoring using sensor layout network technology was integrated with IOS/Android application by Isik et al. (2017) where data from different DS200 soil moisture/humidity sensors with the accuracy of ±2% is placed close to the root zone of the plant at a different region of the sensor layouts transmitted via Wi-Fi to a mobile phone-based on IOS/Android to the central control unit for opening and closing condition of electro valves. The electro valve controls the amount of water to be supplied to the lateral drip line. Another monitoring domain of soil nutrient was demonstrated by Zhang et al. (2017), with an IoT approach using a portable soil nutrient detector. Other parameters sensed alongside with soil nutrients include soil moisture, air/soil temperature, and humidity using the SHT 17 digital sensor interfaced wirelessly with JN5139 system control node using Zigbee. The sensed parameter was fed into a decision support system (DSS) for decision making for an irrigated citrus cultivation. A friendly monitoring technology for soil and nutrient sensing, referred to as chameleon, was implemented by Fandika et al. (2019). This approach makes use of chameleon colours to represent the different states of soil moisture and nutrient level as low, moderate, high. This friendly technology has helped local farmers in Malawi get insight from colour for moisture content without using figures from sensor calibration to improve their water management. A design of silicon chip for in-situ monitoring of the soil nitrogen cycle was reported by Joly et al. (2017), using an ion-sensitive field-effect transistor (ISFET) microsensor for measuring soil pH and soil nitrogen content. Likwise, Bah et al. (2012) reviewed and proposed soil nutrient monitoring using on the go sensor technologies deployed for site-specific management of nutrient concentration where the efficient mapping of nutrient variability can be carried out using electromechanical and optical sensors. Another innovative soil moisture monitoring approach was demonstrated by Huuskonen and Oksanen, (2018) through the use of drones camera on aerial surveillance to create soil maps to determining the soil sample location and management zones. After analysis of the images, the result contains soil moisture and nutrient contents of different zones for irrigation planning and scheduling. The quality of water used for irrigation was monitored using the IoT approach and reported by Prasad et al. (2016), where oxidation-reduction potential, conductivity, salinity and potential hydrogen (pH) were sensed in real-time using different types of sensors. Continuous monitoring of these parameters is necessary for maintaining functional health status for plants. 4.2. Weather based monitoring One area of the increased interest of weather-based monitoring is the real-time estimation of the reference evapotranspiration (ETO) using measured weather variables as an indication of water loss from the plant and the soil environment. The rate of water loss largely depends on the precise measurement of solar radiation, air temperature, and wind speed. This data can be measured using IoT- based weather stations and other various types of sensors, as seen in Table 1. One of the most popular technological approaches that are used in precision monitoring of weather and environmental parameters is by using WSN (Bauer and Aschenbruck, 2018, Keswani et al., 2018, Difallah et al., 2018, Hamouda, 2017, Mohanraj et al., 2017, Saraf and Gawali, 2017, Viani et al., 2017, Patil et al., 2013). The implementations present WSN as an alternative and efficient way in which various sensors are interconnected to monitor physical or surrounding environmental conditions for a large cropping area. The system was reported to achieve real-time monitoring and analysis of data from the sensors in a feedback loop, which activates the control devices based on a pre-calculated threshold value. Wasson et al. (2017) presents an IoT-based weather monitoring system which monitors and analyse the crop environment like air temperature, humidity, solar radiation, wind speed and moisture content in the soil, making use of different weather-based sensors interfaced with wireless communication standard for real-time data transfer and web-based services. A similar approach was demonstrated by Shahzadi et al. (2016), where three sensor networks with each comprising three soil moisture sensors, temperature, and leaf wetness were used for precise and accurate sensing of moisture content, weather and leaf wetness of the farm layout. The sensor nodes intercommunication was established using ZigBee-802.15.4 wasp-mote board with a transmission range of 500 m at 38,400 bps through the gateway to the webserver where an expert system takes irrigation decisions. Villarrubia et al. (2017) demonstrated a multi-agent-based monitoring approach using an open-source platform called PANGEA for collecting various forms of weather variables using sensors for temperature, solar radiation, humidity, pH, wind, and soil moisture. The platform comprises several Master and Slave nodes that are sensor networked to communicate at 433 MHz radiofrequency for sensor data transfer. The collection of various sensor data was fused using a fuzzy expert system to decide the volume of water needed for irrigation. Similarly, Rahman et al. (2019) developed an IoT dashboard for the management of a smart fibrous capillary irrigation system. Several variables, such as soil moisture content, weather, and others plant information are displayed on the dashboard, while the real time capture plant images for estimating leave area index is illustrated in Fig. 6. This helped in enhancing monitoring and control using an IoT system as a critical tool that is targeted at precision irrigation. With the help of real-time monitoring of weather variables, an hourly estimation of reference evapotranspiration, which determines water loss from soil and plant canopies, was computed using an FAO-56 Modified Penman-Monteith equation using a developed Arduino based IoT Davis Vantage Pro 2 weather station. The Penman-Monteith evapotranspiration model is shown in Eq. (1). (1) where is the reference evapotranspiration (mm/hour); Δ represents the slope of saturation vapour pressure (kPa°C−1); Rn is the reference crop canopy net radiation (W/m2); λ represent the latent heat of vaporization (kPa°C−1); T represents the mean air temperature in Celsius; is the Mean daily or hourly wind speed at 2-m height (ms−1); represent the stream pressure of saturation vapour (kPa) (Rahman et al., 2018). The estimated reference evapotranspiration can be used to determine the actual evapotranspiration ( ), which is the water loss from a particular crop, from where the estimated amount of water to compensate for the water loss is computed for onward application to the plant, based on the crop coefficient ( ) which varies from one plant to another.

Plant-Based monitoring Plant-based monitoring using optical sensors has emerged as a widely used approach to assess plant water stress status, determining the health status of crops as well as potential threat to plant growth and development such as drought, lack of nutrients, and attacks from pest. Some of these optical sensors can be fixed (immovable) closed to the plant or mounted on moving platforms such as drones, UAVs, movable sprinkler machines (Bogue, 2017), and satellites (Nutini et al., 2017). Wireless sensor networks and gateway node approach were developed by Jia et al. (2019) to collect soil moisture content in the tea plantation using captured images of the cultivated plant and soil. The pictures of the tea leaves were gathered for assessment of the tea deficiency by using a high definition camera mounted on the UAV. The proposed system helped in water conservation to a great extent and also reduces soil erosion as only required fertilizers are injected via the drip system. The integration of the IoT together with wireless sensor networks, as demonstrated by Bauer and Aschenbruck (2018), was used for in situ monitoring of the Leaf area index (LAI), a vital crop parameter used for optimal irrigation and crop performance. This was achieved using an optical filter and diffuser for photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) measurement needed to derive a reliable estimate of LAI. The use of UAV equipped with high-resolution cameras for smart aerial monitoring of irrigation area vegetation was presented by (Aleotti et al., 2018, Uddin et al., 2017). This area now has an increased research focus towards achieving precision irrigation. In Aleotti et al. (2018), the UAV with an on board camera containing Sony IMX 219 CMOS sensor was configured to fly over the irrigation field testbed. The integration of multispectral images captured by the UAV cameras with DSS was used to compute the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) map used for precise control of the linear sprinkler machine used for irrigation of the tomato cultivated field layout. The authors reported that a higher water saving could be achieved with the integration of NDVI technical index with DSS. Similarly, Harun et al. (2019) proposed an improved indoor farming IoT monitoring for the growth of Brassica Chinensis plant, where remote monitoring of spectrum using light sensors as well as a network of sensors for monitoring of CO2, ambient temperature, humidity, nutrient and Leaf area index was presented. The combination of these conditions was used to apply water to the plant, which was controlled by the pulse-width modulated (PWM) actuator interfaced with IoT embedded device. The study was able to establish the effect of photoperiod light spectrum and intensity to determine the optimal plant physiology and morphology, such as leaf photosynthesis rate, water used efficiency, leaf stomatal conductance and chlorophyll on Brassica Chinensis. A cyber-physical system model approach for smart monitoring of potatoes vegetation status was demonstrated by Rad et al. (2015). The architecture for the monitoring system was in four layers, namely, physical, network, DSS, and application layers. Real-time information is obtained from sensors mounted on UAV, tractors, and satellites via the physical layer. The network layers help to access and transmit information interfaced with the DSS layer where maps of vegetation (NDVI), soil resources as well as chlorophyll content are computed, and lastly, the application layer forms the interface between the decision layer and the human operator. Lozoya et al. (2016) implemented a sensor network for monitoring and control of green pepper vegetation in four different irrigation area layouts. Each of the irrigation areas was monitored using a 10HS volumetric water content sensor, hunter flow sensor, camera for capturing vegetation images, actuator nodes which contain a rain bird irrigation valve for on/off control of water, as well as IoT-based weather station for estimation of reference evapotranspiration. Likewise, Lozoya et al. (2019) analysed two methods of spectral sensing instruments such as decagon’ spectral reflectance sensor and Mapir’s survey 3 camera’s ability to measure plant health status through NDVI in a greenhouse experiment. It was reported that both methods, achieved similar spectral results on plant health status, which could be combined with soil moisture sensing for optimal irrigation control.

Hardware Field implementation 5. Control techniques for precision irrigation Adopting advanced control techniques in an irrigation system helps to achieve the application of water in the desired proportion to crops at the right time, to achieve high water use efficiency, increased yields, energy-saving, optimise fertilizer use and labour saving (Boman et al., 2015). Therefore, leveraging on the monitoring of several parameters influencing irrigation performance such as air and canopy temperature, rainfall, evapotranspiration, and solar radiation, various control methods have been suggested to improve optimal irrigation systems and to increase their efficiency (Marinescu et al., 2017). It is possible to categorize the irrigation control techniques primarily into closed-loop and open-loop control strategies. Similarly, the combination of both closed-loop and open-loop control method has also been proposed as a hybrid control strategy. The irrigation controllers are examined in this section based on these classifications into different irrigation control techniques, as illustrated in Fig. 7. Download : Download high-res image (281KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 7. Classification of different Control techniques for Precision Irrigation System. 5.1. Open loop irrigation control technique In an open-loop irrigation control system, irrigation decisions are made empirically by the operator using both mechanical or electromechanical irrigation timers and the volume of water to be delivered or indirectly via the speed of a movable sprinkler machine. The volume of water and the time for irrigation is often specified and applied based on the knowledge of the operator on perceived crop response, rather than on a precise measurement (Zazueta et al., 2008). Also, irrigation systems control based on open-loop have been broadly used by farmers, and it implies that a pre-set action is done using irrigation timers (Agency, 2017). The parameters set by the system operator are often the time and the volume of water to be supplied, not minding the crop response. An open-loop system is simple to implement because sensors are not required in order to measure the varying parameters affecting the plant, such as soil moisture contents, other weather variables, and also no need for feedback concept, hence saves cost (Harper, 2017). The block diagram of the open-loop irrigation system is illustrated in Fig. 8. Download : Download high-res image (53KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 8. Block diagram of the open-loop irrigation system. A time-based sprinkler and drip irrigation system for coastal horticulture was carried by Sudarmaji et al. (2019) based on the open-loop control approach. The timing was designed using a real-time clock (RTC) interfaced with an Arduino board connected to an actuator for switching on the DC pump for drip and AC pump for sprinkler irrigation. Montesano et al. (2016) implemented a timer-based irrigation system in a greenhouse. The results show that timer-controlled irrigation experienced 18% leaching with a leaser leaf area index when compared to the performance with a closed-loop sensor-based approach. The issue associated with the open-loop irrigation control method is its susceptibility to environmental disturbances. The control input does not generally take the dynamics in the system into consideration. It also cannot automatically react to varying conditions in the environment, development stage requirement of plants, and requires frequent resetting to achieve high levels of irrigation efficiency (Patil and Desai, 2013). Examples of the open-loop irrigation techniques are irrigation timer, volume-based, and conventional approach, as illustrated using the block diagram in Fig. 8. Irrigation timers are simple controllers consisting of clock units capable of activating one or more subunits of the irrigation system at a specific time. 5.2. Closed loop irrigation control system The closed-loop irrigation controllers operate based on a feedback control scheme designed to keep the desired output condition by comparing it with some pre-set conditions to decide the duration and amount of water supply to plants. In Klein et al. (2018), a closed-loop irrigation system fully automates the delivery of irrigation and calculates the water requirement of the plant. The operator creates a general control approach in closed-loop systems, and once the overall approach is formulated, the control system takes over the time and frequency of water supply to plants (Patil and Desai, 2013). The decisions as to when and where to irrigate are dependent and guided by various data obtained from sensors as feedback and compared with the desired set point, as illustrated in Fig. 9. Therefore, sensing of environmental and canopy variables (such as soil moisture, NDVI (images of the plant), LEA index) as well as weather (temperatures, humidity, solar radiation, etc.) as seen in Table 1 are required when designing automatic irrigation controllers (Deng et al., 2018, Adeyemi et al., 2017). The present condition of the decision variables is compared against some certain decision statements, to initiate action on the control of irrigation. Download : Download high-res image (54KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 9. Block diagram of the closed-loop irrigation system. Many research works have been published on monitoring and automatic irrigation integrated with the IoT system based on closed-loop irrigation control principles. They made use of a closed-loop control approach, where soil, plant, and weather variables are combined to measure water demand of the crop and for irrigation scheduling and optimization. However, the nonlinear nature and changing dynamics of plants, make control of irrigation extremely cumbersome. Also, due to the necessity of the use of numerous sensors into the irrigation system coupled with the challenges of installations and calibrations, they require immense implementation expenses by farmers and researchers. This survey paper divides the closed-loop control approach to linear control, such as Proportional Integral Derivative controller, intelligent, optimal/adaptive, and other control schemes, as illustrated in Fig. 7. 5.2.1. Linear control 5.2.1.1. Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) based irrigation controller Over the years, classical proportional-integral-derivative popularly known as PID has been widely used for industrial feedback control systems due to their simple structure, extensive control algorithm, and low cost. It offers better efficiency because of its control ability on the actual output of a process to track the set output while minimizing error (Mantri and Kulkarni, 2013). However, classic PID controllers may suffer a setback in control performance when faced with external disturbances, also being a linear controller, it is not suited for systems that are highly nonlinear (Yesil et al., 2014). To achieve good control performance, each component in the control loop can be characterized by tunning appropriate PID controller parameters. Empirical methods are used to evaluate the PID parameters with consideration of how the system functions under open-loop circumstances. An improved PID controller unit was developed, with a constrained integral function, to ensure proper regulation during the diurnal cycle of adequate water to meet the need of the plant (Goodchild et al., 2015). The controller reacts rapidly to varying environmental conditions, including precipitation occasions, which can result in controller windup, under watering, and stress circumstances of the plant. The work shows how a constraint PID controller functions to provide robust and precise irrigation management watering (Rodríguez et al., 2015). For a similar purpose, to address the linearity and non-linearity of associated with the dynamics of irrigation farming of crops, Zhang et al., 2018, Yubin et al., 2017, Bi and Zheng, 2014 proposed a PID fuzzy control strategy of water and fertilizer for precision irrigation. The study shows that reasonable control of water and fertilizer ratio in agricultural irrigation and water conservation was achieved with better controller robustness and stability. For the same purpose, Yubin (2018) demonstrated a control technology based on PID fuzzy algorithm for precise application of water and fertilizer, the PID controller is based on fuzzy rules and rules-based matrix table for real-time self-parameter tuning as well as effectively predicting the water requirement of the crop to achieve precision irrigation. The implementation results show that the PID fuzzy control system has the advantages of high control precision with reducing overshoot by 14.68% and better stability, but the control performance was degraded when the fertilizer density change significantly. A similar result was obtained in Bi and Zheng (2014), where the integration of grey theory, fuzzy rules and PID algorithm for fertilizer and water precision control with very low control overshoot and robust stability was reported. Classical closed-loop control technology such as on/off, proportional (P), proportional-integral (PI), and proportional integral differential (PID) are easy to implement, but are unable to control multivariable and moving processes with time delays, however, by cascading several PID controllers or linking feedback paths, the control performances can be improved to a near adaptive manner (Norhaliza et al., 2011). Furthermore, another challenge of the PID controllers is the improper gain selections of these control systems, which can lead to unstable conditions as the systems are non-linear and have non-modelled dynamics. Since it is hectic to tune a PID controller and considering its inability to handle multivariable control problems such as irrigation systems, there is need for researchers to look towards the direction of tuning the parameters of PID controllers using intelligent algorithms such as particle swarm optimization, genetic algorithm or hybrid fuzzy PID for optimal control of irrigation system. 5.2.2. Intelligent control for precision irrigation Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a machine’s ability to learn and execute comparable tasks that characterize human thinking, and it is dedicated to making the machine smarter (Fuentes and Tongson, 2018). It offers the potential for solving complex problems affecting the irrigation system, which are multivariable, non-linear, and time-varying (Su and Ma, 2012). When applied to a specific problem domain, AI algorithms can emulate the process of human decision making. They have been implemented in the form of fuzzy logic, ANN, Support vector machines, and decision trees with significant success to date (Singh and Jha, 2012). Applying machine learning techniques to automatically extract new knowledge in the form of generalized decision rules towards the best management of natural resources such as water to achieve precision irrigation was carried out by Dimitriadis and Goumopoulos (2008). Similarly, different classification and regression algorithms were applied to the collected dataset using various sensors to develop models that could be able to predict an irrigation plan weekly. Also, the potential of applying machine learning on datasets for prediction of yield and disease was reported by Goldstein et al. (2018). In this review, the intelligence-based irrigation controllers discussed are; ANN, fuzzy logic-based as well as other evolutional algorithms that have been used for optimizing irrigation as summarised in Table 3 and discussed in the following subsections.

Fuzzy logic-based irrigation controller An extension of traditional Boolean logic, which allows the expression of logical values between true and false and describes the uncertainty and non-linearity of the real-world problems, is known as fuzzy logic (Hasan et al., 2018). Precision irrigation using fuzzy logic has been utilized in many kinds of literature due to the fact that it does not require an accurate model of the plant object before it can be controlled (Wang and Zhang, 2018; Dela Cruz et al., 2017; Al-Ali et al., 2015, Hussan and Hamouda, 2014, Patil et al., 2013, Touati et al., 2013, Patil et al., 2012). In complex systems such as irrigation with its characteristic nonlinearities, it is difficult to obtain the mathematical model that describes the system. Hence, fuzzy controllers have the potential to replace the role of a mathematical model with a fuzzy model based on the rules formulated in an if-else and then format that is inspired by expert knowledge of the process (Ramli et al., 2017). A fuzzy irrigation system was modelled and simulated by Mousa et al. (2014); the computation of evapotranspiration (ETo) was carried out with the help of fuzzy inference system using input variables such as temperature, humidity, wind, and radiation. The results demonstrate that the fuzzy model is a quick and accurate tool for achieving desired evapotranspiration as well as the required net irrigation to compensate for the water loss due to evapotranspiration. In another work, Keswani et al. (2018), proposed variable learning rate gradient descent feed-forward neural network-based pattern classification to forecast soil moisture content, while the valve control commands were processed using a fuzzy logic-based weather condition modelling system to manipulate the control commands by considering different weather conditions. Fengshen et al. (2018) presented the combination of neural network prediction and fuzzy control algorithm, which combines fertilization with irrigation precisely to reduce irrigation water and the waste of chemical fertilizers, save the production resources, reduces the production costs and improves the efficiency of agricultural products enterprise. In order to maximize the efficiency and production for irrigation system, Hussain et al. (2011) developed a fuzzy logic controller to estimate the amount of water of plants in distinct depth using the irrigation model, soil type, environmental conditions of greenhouse and the type of plant that affect the greenhouse irrigation system. A DSS-based on the combination of the wireless sensor and actuation network technology and fuzzy logic theory is proposed to support the irrigation management in agriculture (Viani et al., 2017), while Alomar (2018) developed a fuzzy logic controller leveraging on IoT for smart irrigation. Fuzzy irrigation controller has proved to be a beneficial control algorithm towards ensuring precision irrigation to improve water use efficiency by accurately calculating the amount of irrigation and addressing the non-linearity associated with the process. However, the performance and accuracy of the fuzzy irrigation controller depend on the designer’s knowledge of the dynamics of the process (plant) to help in formulating the fuzzy rules and proves its feasibility using long term data obtained experimentally. 5.2.2.2. Artificial neural network based irrigation controller An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is an information processing algorithm inspired by how information is processed by biological nervous systems like the human brain. The human brain consists of billions of neurons that intercommunicate for information processing (Liakos et al., 2018). The artificial neurons in ANN are synonymous with the biological neurons in human being based on the nonlinearity properties of ANN, the input, and output mapping capacity for the prediction of different dependent variables (Tsang and Jim, 2016). ANN-based controllers have been applied in irrigation control systems because of their tendency to learn and adapt to the dynamics of the changing variables affecting irrigation. ANN has also been used as a smart strategy that is important in countering the issue of formulating mathematical models using the first-principles approach. A conceptual framework and estimation of evapotranspiration using computation technique of artificial neural network was carried out by Kelley and Pardyjak, 2019, Sharma and Regulwar, 2016, Bemani et al., 2013 to be facilitated by matching irrigation rates to crop water demand based on estimates of actual evapotranspiration(ETC), while analysis of error of an ANN controller based on reference evapotranspiration was carried out by Susilo et al. (2014). Other methods of estimation of evapotranspiration were extensively discussed by Obiechefu (2017). To ensure efficient irrigation scheduling, Umair and Muhammad (2015) proposed an ANN-based controller modelled in MATLAB, using weather variables as input parameters. Additionally, Gu et al. (2017) developed a predictive model using an improved backpropagation (BP) neural network, which was tuned by genetic algorithm (GA) to speed up the convergence of the network, preventing it from getting stocked in local minima. Similarly, research work for a step ahead prediction was carried out by Wong et al. (2018), It asserts that Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), a subclass of ANN, was able to capture highly non-linear systems dynamics sufficiently which makes it suitable predictive control. Another version of RNN called Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), was used for predicting water table depth over the long-term in agricultural areas by using collected times series data (Adeyemi et al., 2018c; Jianfeng et al., 2018), the predictive model achieves higher regression coefficient (R2) scores when compared with other machine learning algorithms. The combination of reinforcement learning and ANN for irrigation control system were also carried out by Lijia et al. (2018), where an off-line learning simulation of sensors and crop yield data was carried out. The artificial neural network-based fast models for soil water content using DSSAT and crop yield was developed to improve the learning process. The ANN algorithm has proven to be a veritable tool for precision irrigation based on previous research; more work still needs to be carried out in the tuning of the ANN controllers. Most of the reviewed papers are simulation-based, further efforts should be made in the implementation of this artificial intelligence algorithms on embedded system hardware to ensure proper validation of simulation findings. However, the accuracy of the ANN-based prediction model or controller depends on how well the data feed in thoroughly represent the behaviour of the system. Efforts should be made to collect data of needed parameters using good and quality sensors, proper sampling time needs to be chosen during data collection. 5.2.2.3. Expert systems based irrigation system An expert system is an algorithm that is developed to mimic the problem-solving ability of a human expert on a specific area of expertise by using artificial intelligence. It typically consists of a structure and intuitive knowledge-based component as well as an inference/control component (Mishra et al., 2014). An expert system solves problems using the expert experience who is consulted, relying on intuitive logic, belief, experience as well as the rule of the thumb. An expert system is being used in problem-solving activities such as planning, forecasting, control system, monitoring, fusing, prescribing, and interpreting decision making (Khamkar, 2014). According to Nada et al. (2014). An irrigation system control based on expert system aims to provide farmers with irrigation expertise on how to determine the exact amount of crop water need at the right time, weather, and growing medium such as temperature, humidity, and soil types. This was demonstrated in Shahzadi et al. (2016), where an expert system for smart agriculture leveraged on the IoT- based monitoring for real-time input of different sensor data to the server where the expert system algorithm was deployed. The structure of the expert system for the irrigation decision proposed for the cotton crop was programmed using C language integrated production system. This contains the knowledge base with working memory, inference engine as well as a user interface. A similar expert system using a wireless sensor network monitoring approach for the cultivation of plant harnessing and ontology was embarked upon by (Panawong and Namahoot, 2017). The wireless sensor network was applied to collect and transfer data of soil moisture, soil pH, and sunlight, which is further fed into the expert system on the webserver to decide the water and fertilizer requirement of the plant. The expert system was then interfaced with an android smartphone for queries of the decision support in real-time. A rule-based expert system named technical specification of drip irrigation-expert system (TSDI-ES), developed by Ragab et al. (2018) was used for choosing the right components (such as filters, motor, pumps, fertigation device) for irrigation network control unit to address the shortage of expert for farm automation. The investigation result on the TSDI-ES algorithm shows that proper control unit components can be chosen by the expert DSS. Eid and Abdrabbo, (2018) developed a hybrid expert system for irrigation management using visual basic programming and access software for the database design. The expert system requires data of crop (harvesting date, planting date, crop coefficient (Kc), crop height, and root depth), climatic data (ETo, ETc), physical properties of the soil (field capacity, wilting point etc.) and input project data (such as area, available discharge and irrigation time). The result obtained revealed that the ISM expert system (ES) out performed other ES by 20% in terms of water use efficiency for tomato crop. Similar method was also implemented by Khamkar (2014) for design of expert system for precise drip irrigation of sugarcane in India. Expert system can be used to enhance the precision irrigation, by using different knowledge based input to realise optimal decisions for precision irrigation. However, the performance of an expert system is based on the accuracy of the knowledge input and rules design by the expert. 5.2.2.4. Genetic algorithm based irrigation controller Genetic Algorithm (GA) is influenced by how living organisms can adapt to the harsh realities of life in a hostile environment, i.e., by evolution and inheritance. GA is a stochastic global search technique that mimics natural evolution. This evolutional algorithm is population-based, which imitates the process of selection of fittest individuals for reproduction. It operates with a fixed-size population of feasible alternatives to problem called individuals, which are changing over time. Three critical components of genetic algorithm operators are selection, crossover, and mutation. GA has been utilized in the optimization of the water system (Sadati et al., 2014), and irrigation networks (Fernando et al., 2014) and also operational scheduling of irrigation canal by Mathur et al. (2009). According to Chen et al. (2011), GA is best suitable for getting a globally optimal solution when compared to other nonlinear methods of programming. GA has been successfully used in tuning controllers such as PID and other optimal controllers. According to Mantri and Kulkarni, (2013), the parameters of PID controller such as , , and are difficult to tune. However, the controller design parameters were tuned by a genetic algorithm which provides faster response time, better stability, and robustness than the Zeigler-Nichols (Z-N) classical method and other tuning methods. An improved GA (IGA) based multilevel parameter optimized feature selection algorithm for extreme machine learning (ELM) classifier (IGA-ELM), which was integrated with an IoT- based DSS, was proposed by Kale and Sonavane (2019). The computation complexity of most advance controllers can be adequately managed using the integration of an evolutionary algorithm in the tuning of an optimal controller, which can enhance the usability of the controller for irrigation. 5.2.2.5. Particle swarm optimization based irrigation controller Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is based on the paradigm of swarm intelligence, and it is motivated by the social behaviour of animals like fishes and birds. It was developed to describe the social behaviour of animals and is capable of handling an optimization test. So, a new optimizer based on the model called Particle Swarm Optimization was proposed (Wang et al., 2018). PSO is an intelligent evolutionary algorithm, which belongs to a class of optimization called metaheuristics. It is also a robust stochastic optimization algorithm that has been successfully applied in various fields such as agriculture, science, and engineering. According to Çam et al. (2015), PSO was developed because of the challenges of using mathematical models in solving optimization problems. This advancement led to the development of heuristic optimization algorithms to drive the events in nature. PSO is an algorithm based on swarm intelligence. The animals moving like swarm can readily achieve their goal. Random movements of swarm creatures make their easy access. Each individual is referred to as particle while the population is called a swarm. Each particle sets its position to the best position according to their previous experience. Moubarak et al. (2018) demonstrated the tuning of PI control of irrigation pump speed using the PSO algorithm. The performance was compared with that of the conventional Ziegler-Nichols (ZN) methods, where the PSO tuned with different performance indices had a better response, efficiency, reduced overshoot, and robust stability. PSO has also successfully been used for optimal irrigation scheduling by Liu et al. (2018), Moubarak et al. (2018), Pawda et al. (2013), Afshar and Rpour (2007). It also offers the potential of been used for tuning irrigation controllers for optimal performances. The tuning of optimal controllers using PSO could help reduce the computational burden, as it speeds up the convergence of error to global minima and searches efficiently under numerous constraints. 5.2.2.6. Hybrid intelligent systems Hybrid intelligent systems are the combination of at least two artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms such as neural networks and fuzzy logic referred to as neuro-fuzzy; others are GAPSO and fuzzy PID. Çam et al. (2015) proposed a hybrid optimization approach to Multi-Layer Perceptron using the combination of an artificial bee colony, GA and PSO to help the critical parameters of backpropagation algorithm such as learning rate and momentum coefficient to speed up learning and deviation ratio from the global minimum and improved the robustness and stability of the system. Also, Allawi et al. (2018) developed an artificial intelligence model called Shark Machine Learning Algorithm (SMLA) to provide optimal operational rules. This algorithm outperformed GA and PSO when compared. In Tseng et al. (2018), aerial agricultural images of soil moisture condition was used to support automatic irrigation; the study proposed the used of seven different machine learning algorithms to learn local soil moisture conditions using images of the soil. The simulation result of the controller shows that water consumption was reduced by 52% and robust to errors in irrigation level, location, and timing. Related work was carried out by Wen and Shang (2019), where two machine learning algorithm (support vector machine and random forest) were combined to analyse remote sensing data for crop identification. In the work of Perea et al. (2018), the combination of dynamic Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) architecture, the Bayesian framework and Genetic Algorithms (GA) were used for forecasting the short term daily irrigation water demand when data availability is limited. When compared to previous work, the model developed enhanced the forecast precision by 3% to 11%. Similarly, in Ma et al. (2019), the combination of farmer's knowledge and the IoT was used for deficit irrigation control. Images of the soil were captured, and feature extraction was carried out using a convolutional neural network for soil moisture prediction and further fed into the fuzzy controller. The combination of the IoT was used to get information from the field, artificial intelligence and image processing was used to provide more precise and comprehensive control to enhance the irrigation process and hydroponics system, as seen in Mehra et al. (2018) where the integration of ANN and Bayesian network algorithm with IoT for intelligent interaction and control of hydroponics system input parameters. Likewise, the combination of AI algorithms, greenhouse climate, irrigation, and crop growth control challenge embarked upon by Hemming et al. (2019), was aimed at combining horticultural expertise with AI offers a breakthrough in fresh food production with limited resources. Integrating a hybrid intelligent algorithm for control of irrigation can help achieve robust precision irrigation and can be used to enhance the performance and smartness of existing irrigation controllers. 5.2.3. Model predictive based irrigation controller Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a multivariable computer control algorithm that became popular in the power plants, chemicals, and petroleum industries (Qin and Badgwell, 2003). It has also been applied in a wide variety of industrial applications such as pharmaceuticals (Wong et al., 2018, Lee et al., 2016), wastewater treatment plants (Rahmat et al., 2011), building (Bosschaerts et al., 2017), food processing, automotive, and aerospace (Yakub and Mori, 2013). According to Ding et al. (2018), although MPC is an industry born process control method, it is incredibly applicable in agricultural activities such as irrigation control, given that it can deal efficiently with multivariable, nonlinear, and large time-delay systems such as irrigation. MPC has the advantages of dealing with constraints; its capability of utilizing simple models, closed-loop stability, and its robustness against parametric uncertainties make it one of the most popular multivariable control algorithms (Mohamed et al., 2015). Also, MPC is an industrial control technique employed in decision support for large scale multivariable problems with multiple constraints (Ocampo-Martinez, 2010). It requires a heavy computational burden to optimize the future control inputs and future process responses that are predicted using a mathematical model and optimized according to a cost function. In order to obtain a future value of the performance criterion, this control technique uses a plant model and an optimizer for calculating plant input. The performance of the system is predicted over a finite horizon subject to constraints on both the inputs and outputs of the plant (Lozoya et al., 2014). All systems experience one form of constraint to another, ranging from physical, environmental to economic constraints, which limits the operation of a process. By adopting advanced process control techniques such as MPC for irrigation control, excellent performance, better efficiency and optimality can be achieved when compared to the use of classical control methods (Balbis et al., 2006). Because of the robustness of MPC, the concept of shifting the prediction and control horizon based on the next sampling step is always applied, wherein the prediction horizons define the optimal future control signal. However, it suffers the challenge of very high computational complexity due to the fact that it solves online optimization at every time step, which needs to be addressed. Proper system identification of a plant is required to be carried out to identify model parameters to help reduce the design effort and computational load of the predictive model controller (Wahab et al., 2008). This advanced process control method requires an accurate process model that tries to summarize and describe the behaviour of the system. Better satisfactory control performances can be achieved based on the accuracy of the process model. Perhaps, the most important use of the system model arises in predictive control applications, in which the model is used to predict the process output behaviour when facing changes in set point or inputs. Developing the mathematical model can be achieved using either the first principle approach when the physics of the process is understood or by using data-driven or soft computing approaches such as system identification and other artificial intelligence approaches (neural networks, LSTM). An example of the data-driven modelling approach was carried out by Ławrýnczuk (2013), who also observed that the development and validation of the first principle-based model are complicated and proposed a soft computing approach using a neural network as a better alternative. MPC provides control actions by repeatedly solving a constrained optimization problem, with predictions obtained using the model of the plant. The control action is provided by minimizing a cost function subject to constraints over a finite prediction horizon. This can be applied to multi-input, multi-output (MIMO) systems (Bordons, 2003). Another approach that was adopted by Delgoda et al. (2014) applied grey box modelling using linear time series data obtained from a water balance model. The system identification was carried out considering under saturated circumstances and noise on the soil moisture readings. The model fits of 84 and 63 percent for the two-field information set observed and satisfaction in all residual tests while the model fit above 99% using AQUACROP model data. Furthermore, a grey box system identification method was also compared with a white box, otherwise known as the first principle approach used to develop a model for a model predictive controller used for a multi-zone office building (Picard et al., 2016). Another modelling approach in many kinds of literature is by using the system identification method, which is an essential tool for technical areas that provides a mathematical and physical representation of a dynamic system through different models that can be used for controller design, but they require operational data (Mathworks, 2015). In order to combine the best features of the two approaches, dynamic modelling based on the combination of system identification and physical modelling was proposed by (Adeyemi et al., 2018b; Ooi and Weyer, 2008). This method was also adopted by Adeyemi et al. (2018a), where system identification was used to develop a data-driven model for prediction of plant transpiration dynamics. The results obtained stated that a second-order discrete-time transfer function model adequately explained the dynamics with an average determination coefficient of ±R 0.93 0.04 with incoming radiation, vapour pressure, and leaf area index as inputs. While first principle-based models or grey boxes are desirable, obtaining models that are effective and fit for purpose may not always be practical, and precision irrigation agriculture has often depended on data-driven modelling for system identification instead. A research work carried out by Winkler et al. (2016), was able to overcome the physical constraint of the traditional irrigation system with the emergence of a sprinkler node capable of sensing the local soil moisture, communicating it wirelessly, and actuate its sprinkler based on a centrally computed timetable. The author suggested that future work may be directed to data-driven system identification, where soil moisture and weather variables measurements leveraging on the IoT and knowledge of fluid movement can be used to build the predictive model over time to address the changing dynamics of the environment. Although few of researchers have adopted the use of a predictive model for control as seen in (Delgoda et al., 2016a, Delgoda et al., 2016b, Lozoya et al., 2016, Saleem et al., 2013, Puig et al., 2012) for irrigation control as summarized in Table 4, there is still need for its enhancement to help achieve water saving, minimize the energy needed for irrigation and to ensure better yield by developing better predictive models, optimization algorithm and by integrating IoT for enhancement of the monitoring and real-time adaptive control. According to Koech and Langat (2018), real-time optimal based control of the irrigation system is still is rapidly attracting more research effort for surface irrigation because of its ability to improve water use efficiency, as illustrated in Fig. 10. Therefore, MPC has been an optimal based control, which offers a very promising method for improving water use efficiency, as 40% of the water consumed by irrigation can be saved using a predictive model when compared with the conventional system or open-loop automatic irrigation system (Lefkowitz, 2019).

Advances in irrigation Technologies (Koech and Langat, 2018). However, not much work has been reported in the tuning of the model predictive controllers using evolutional algorithms such as GA and PSO, towards the realization of smart irrigation systems (with optimization and real-time control) for improving water use efficiency (WUE). Future work should focus on adaptive model predictive control to be able to track the changing dynamics and uncertainties effectively. Also, due to the computation complexity of predictive and optimization algorithms, which makes it challenging for its implementation on target embedded systems, future work should focus on leveraging on industrial IoT servers for real-time control of the irrigation process. 5.2.4. Adaptive decision support system and other precision irrigation control method The characteristics of soil, plant, and weather variables that affect the cropping system are dynamic and nonlinear; hence, they are time-varying parameters. In farming, the properties that typically vary within and between seasons which include crop coefficient, plant growth, soil properties, and environmental factors. Therefore, those factors have a direct effect on the timing and irrigation quantity needed for ideal plant growth (Evans and King, 2012). The heart of an adaptive decision support system includes the real-time monitoring of the various parameters using different types of sensors as well as the modification and adjustment of the adaptive rules in the decision support system. Adaptive Decision Support System makes use of sensor feedback readings of soil, plant, and weather parameters stored on cloud platforms to regularly re-adjust the scheduling algorithm to maintain the required irrigation system efficiency. The adaptive performance of the system is measured on how well the changing dynamics of the plant in terms of infield temporal and spatial variability is captured. The adaptability to parameter uncertainties, spatial variabilities and the environmental disturbances on irrigation systems have been extensively investigated by using optimal control with the adaptive feature as well as variable rate water application systems proposed by numerous researchers (Pereira et al., 2018, Raine and Mccarthy, 2014, Smith et al., 2009, Evans and Sadler, 2008). Also, several works on the adaptive control of machines based on continuous move systems such as low energy precision application (LEPA), centre pivot, a linear and lateral move for spatially variable irrigation has been carried out (Debauche et al., 2018, Peters, 2014, Smith et al., 2009). Due to their present automation stage and the big coverage area using a single lateral pipe, these systems are particularly suited for variable rate implementation (Adeyemi et al., 2017). A sprinkler controlled with a modulated pulse on a self-moving linear sprinkler system was applied by Evans et al. (2012b), where wireless sensor network-based DSS was optimized to adapt changes of crop type, irrigation pattern, and field location for instructions on individual sprinkler heads on how much water to apply and where it is needed. Similarly, Patel et al. (2017) successfully applied a DSS for an on-farm sensor-based irrigation water management to determine the timing and volume of irrigation using a border, sprinkler, and drip irrigation systems for wheat, maize, potato, and chili crops. However, the usage and adoption of the various types of site-specific variable rate (SS-VRI) precision irrigation technologies have generally been limited by farmers and researchers. Thus, a potential barrier is that full implementation of advanced SS-VRI generally has the most demanding requirements and the most complicated and costly control systems of all precision irrigation technologies (Evans and King, 2012). Simulation models can be used to simulate crop reactions to irrigation and plant management based on the physical modelling of the crop phenology by first principles (Mccarthy et al., 2014). These simulation models offer the opportunity to enhance precision irrigation strategies as the need for time-consuming field experiments is eliminated (Cong et al., 2017). A simulation framework called VARIwise, which was used for precision irrigation and capable of performing real-time decision support, was proposed by Mccarthy et al. (2014). The framework was able to integrate input information from real-time sensors for irrigation adaptive decisions. However, simulation models are necessary to assist irrigation decisions making in order to achieve model precision; most often, the information is limited to a particular plant that the platform is accessible for that purpose. The limitation in data available for this endeavour often limits the use of the platforms to specific crops. Similarly, a crop water model newly developed by FAO, called Aqua Crop, simulates the response of water to crop yield. It was calibrated using ten years of daily weather data to grow winter wheat and subsequently used to simulate yield under different sowing dates, irrigation frequencies, and irrigation sequences (Ali and Abustan, 2013). The simulation result shows that under the prevailing climatic and soil conditions, irrigation frequency is the most water-efficient schedule for wheat. The results further indicate a lower yield trend under late sowing. An optimization framework based on simulation for the ideal fertigation schedule was developed by Cong et al. (2017). The problem is represented in the form of decision tree graphs, and ant colony optimization (ACO) is used as the optimization engine and a process-based crop growth model to evaluate the objective function. The results show that ACO was able to identify irrigation and fertilizer schedules that result in better net returns while using less irrigation water and fertilizer. Also available in the literature is a crop process-based model called DSS for Agro-technology Transfer (DSSAT). This software consists of 16 different crop models with software to evaluate and apply the crop models for various purposes. However, it is increasingly difficult to maintain the DSSAT crop models, because different sets of computer code were written for different crops with little attention to software design at the level of crop models themselves (Jones et al., 2003). Levidow et al. (2014) suggested that for farmers and researchers to be able to use a DSS efficiently, it should not be too complicated but user-friendly, affordable, and informative systems helpful to achieve precision irrigation. 6. Commercial irrigation system for farmers and researchers As precision irrigation control is crucial to increase productivity and ensuring food security, so many companies have developed a smart watering system that may help achieve high water-saving and precise irrigation; few are highlighted in Table 5. Most of the products aim to achieve precision irrigation and reducing the stress involved in manual irrigation. Table 5. Commercial irrigation system.

Also, most of these commercial irrigation systems available in the market are custom-built, therefore, making them difficult to be appropriately tuned and adaptively controlled. Furthermore, most of the commercial irrigation systems do not consider soil, plant, weather parameters conditions in making irrigation decisions for optimal water saving. Also, the effect of disturbances to plants such as evapotranspiration, signifying water loss from plants and the surface of the soil, the changing and nonlinear dynamics of plants cannot be correctly manage by most of the commercial products. 7. Future research directions The essence of this review work is to explore the various efforts and progress that have been made to improve water use efficiency, water-saving, and above all, to achieve food security using the IoT- based monitoring and applied control systems. From the review, researchers and farmers can leverage on recent developmental evolution on the IoT for real-time monitoring and data collection for data-driven control, machine, and deep learning for intelligent prediction of agricultural processes such as yield, water consumption, and weather. Further investigation is needed on the use of normalized dimension vegetation index (NDVI), lea area index (LEA) as well as other technical indexes in deciding and planning irrigation scheduling for large irrigation farm area. Also, accurate model-based predictions can guide farmers to prepare for the activities and guide against unusual changes that can affect agricultural practices. Furthermore, different control algorithms in the context of irrigation systems have been discussed; researchers should focus on enhancing any of the model-based and adaptive controllers with real time monitoring for precision irrigation. The integration of evolutional algorithms such as Genetic Algorithm, Ant Colony and Particle Swarm Optimization for parameters tuning of adaptive irrigation controllers, is important for the adaptation of nonlinear and changing dynamics of soil, plant and weather variables while ensuring optimal precision irrigation for enhancement of irrigation technology. In addition, the development of the digital and complex irrigation technology is really important to be explored, so that developed technology will provide a stable, suitable, and affordable system for ordinary farmers in improving the water use efficiency while minimizing water scarcity for agricultural activities. Though, the various types of monitoring and advanced control strategies for precision irrigation have been discussed in this review, and they might not have covered all the approaches in kinds of literature. Interested readers can refer to the cited references in the paper, from which more related articles could be accessed. 8. Conclusion The global awareness on the effect of global warming and climate change on water scarcity and food security is on the increase, which has challenged researchers to brace up more efforts developing cutting edge strategies on real-time monitoring and control for precision agriculture that can mitigate the effect of this inevitable phenomenon. This review on the monitoring and control strategies for precision irrigation systems is based on the previous and relevant research work that has been done to help achieve water saving in agriculture. This review article has been able to give a clear picture of research trends in developing advanced control strategies for precision irrigation and to assess research opportunities in studies that can ensure water saving, improve crop yield and optimize the energy needed for irrigation. It is expected to generate new ideas and inspire readers on how current monitoring and advance control approaches can be enhanced towards achieving improved precision irrigation for food security and help achieve water saving on forestalling imminent water crises.

However, the first-principle laws that describe the complex agro-hydrological dynamics pose challenges in control applications. In this work, we propose a 2-layer neural network (NN) framework to approximate the complex nonlinear dynamics of the agro-hydrological system to reduce the computational cost of the first-principle model.

Introduction Water scarcity is a rapidly escalating global issue due to various factors such as population growth and climate change. Approximately 70% of the freshwater is consumed by agriculture activities [1]. Thus, improving the water-use efficiency in the agriculture industry is essential. Currently, practical irrigation policies are mostly determined based on heuristic or empirical knowledge regardless of real-time feedback from the field, which is also referred to as open-loop irrigation policies. The efficiency of this approach is typically low, as the applied irrigation amount can be imprecise and lead to over or insufficient irrigation. Increasing attentions have been drawn to closed-loop irrigation over the past decade [2], [3]. Advanced control strategies such as MPC are popular due to their ability of handling constraints and multiple objectives simultaneously [4]–[9]. One of the major challenges in applying advanced control to the agro-hydrological system is the high computational cost. The water dynamics are highly nonlinear and are often described by the Richards equation, which is a nonlinear PDE developed based on first principles [10]. Spatial discretization is often required to simplify the Richards equation in applications [10], however, the resulting nonlinear ODE system is still challenging to solve and involves more states. Model reduction or approximation techniques are commonly used, for example, in [6] a linear parameter-varying (LPV) model was identified for agro-hydrological dynamics approximation. Computational cost reduction was observed but was still not sufficient for real-time optimizations. Motivated by the accuracy and computational efficiency of the neural network (NN) reduction model presented in [11], we propose a 2-layer NN framework to approximate the agro-hydrological dynamics. Section II introduces the considered agro-hydrological system, and section III presents details of the proposed NN framework. Model validation is provided in IV. Finally, two plant-model-missmatch compensation strategies are investigated to improve the prediction performance. Fig. 1. A schematic diagram of the considered agro-hydrological system. Show All SECTION II. Preliminaries A schematic of the agro-hydrological system of interest is shown in Figure 1. Only the soil water dynamics on the vertical axis are considered. The crop of interest is grass. Irrigation is applied with a sprinkler and is assumed to reach the soil surface evenly. Precipitation is considered as a known disturbance based on weather forecasting data and is assumed to reach the soil surface in identical ways as irrigation. A. Soil Water Dynamics Based on first principles, the soil water dynamics can be modeled using the 1-dimensional Richards equation with the crop and weather information taken into account [10]: c(h) ∂h ∂t = ∂ ∂z [K(h)( ∂h ∂z +1)]−α(h) K c E T 0 z r (1) View Source where h[m] is the capillary potential, c(h)[ m −1 ] denotes the soil capillary capacity, and K(h)[m/s] is the soil hydraulic conductivity. z represents the vertical axis of the soil, with the upward direction considered as the positive direction. c(h) and K(h) are modeled by the van Genuchten-Mualem soil hydraulic model [12] (2)-(3): c(h)=( θ s − θ r )αn(1− 1 n ) (−αh) n−1 [1+ (−αh) n ] 1 n −2 (2) View Source K(h)= K s [ (1+ (−αh) n ) −(1− 1 n ) ] 1 2 ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ 1− [1− [ (1+ (−αh) n ) −(1− 1 n ) ] n n−1 ] 1− 1 n ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ 2 (3) View Source where K s [ m/s] denotes the saturated hydraulic conductivity, θ s [ m 3 / m 3 ], θ r [ m 3 / m 3 ],α[ m −1 ] , and n are soil-property-related parameters. Sandy loam soil is considered in this work and the corresponding parameters can be found in [13]. The −α(h) K c E T 0 z r term in (1) captures the effect of weather and crop, where α(h) and Kc are dimensionless factors, namely the water stress factor and the crop coefficient. E T 0 [ m] denotes the reference evapotranspiration and is assumed to be a known weather-dependent disturbance. z r =−0.13m represents the rooting depth of the crop and is assumed to be time-invariant in this work. B. Boundary Conditions The boundary conditions employed in this work are presented in (4)-(5). At the soil surface, the Neumann boundary condition is employed while free drainage is assumed at the bottom. ∂h(t) ∂z T=−1− I(t)+P(t) K(h(t)) (4) View Source ∂h(t)+z ∂z | B =1 (5) View Source where I(t)[m/s] and P(t)[m/s] denote the rate of irrigation and precipitation at time t. Note that interception caused by grass leaves is ignored in this work, only evapotranspiration, precipitation, and irrigation are considered. C. Model Discretization The system of equation (1) is discretized over the vertical spatial axis following the approach proposed in [10], which leads to an ODE system: x ˙ (t)=f(x(t), u(t)) (6) View Source where x∈ R n=26 and u∈ R r=1 are the state and input vector respectively, while f defines the nonlinear system dynamics. The total depth of soil considered is 0.5 m and is evenly discretized into 26 nodes. The water dynamics at the center of each node are used to represent the dynamics of the entire node. In this work, irrigation rate I(t)[m/s] is the system input u, h[m] at the discretized nodes represents the system states x. The system output y∈ R l=1 is the volumetric water content θ[ m 3 / m 3 ] at the rooting depth, which is an algebraic function of the state vector defined by the soil-water retention equation of van Genuchten (7). Eqn. (6) and Eqn. (7) are used to generate all training datasets. θ(h)=( θ s − θ r ) [ 1 1+ (−αh) n ] 1− 1 n + θ r (7) View Source Fig. 2. A schematic diagram of the proposed 2-layer NN framework. Show All SECTION III. Reduction NN Model Design To reduce the computational complexity of the first-principle model, a two-layered NN framework is proposed to approximate its nonlinear dynamics. In this section, details regarding the proposed framework will be discussed. Section III-A introduces the motivation and provides an overview of the proposed framework. Section III-B and III-C discuss the data generation procedure for the individual layers of the framework respectively. A. Overview The motivation for designing the proposed framework is the unsatisfying prediction performance of a single LSTM. Furthermore, it was found that a single LSTM provides much better prediction performance if the operating region is small. Detailed simulation results will be presented in section IV. A schematic diagram of the proposed framework is presented in Figure 2. The first layer contains multiple sub-models (Model 1 – I, referred to as M 1 , M 2 ,⋯ , MI in the following text) while the second layer contains one model (Model A, referred to as MA). Each sub-model is responsible for a sub-operating region. The union set of the sub-operating regions forms the entire operating region of interest. M 1 − M I are LSTMs while MA is a fully-connected NN. At the current time step t, the system input and output obtained from p previous time steps are fed to Model 1 – I: N N in = ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ u(t−p+1),y(t−p+1) u(t−p+2),y(t−p+2) ⋯ u(t),y(t) ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ , View Source The I one-step-ahead predictions of the system output (N N out 1 =[ y ¯ 1 (t+1),⋯, y ¯ I (t+1) ] T ) are returned from the sub-models. N N ou t 1 is then feed to MA, where the final prediction of the system output at the next time step (N N out 2 = y pred (t+1)) is obtained. Inspired by Mao et al. [6], the proposed framework adopts the idea of the LPV models, which enhances the model performance by combining predictions made by multiple sub-models. B. Data Generation - First Layer As discussed in the previous section, the first layer of the proposed framework consists of I LSTMs. In this work, I = 3 is used. Table I presents the operating regions in terms of the system output of the sub-models. Each model is equivalent to a nonlinear function: m i : R 20×2 → R 1 , i=1,2,3 View Source where the model input is a matrix and the output is a scalar. 20 is the number of the past input-output data points (p = 20), 2 is the number of system input (n = 1) plus the number of system output (l = 1). All models consist of a sampling time of 2 hours. TABLE I Operating Ranges of the Sub-Models Fig. 3. A sector of the training dataset of M2 Show All The training datasets are generated separately for each model such that the system output varies in the selected operating range. For each sub-model, a 30000-points-dataset is generated. Multi-level pseudorandom input signals are employed. The signal is similar to a pseudorandom binary signal except that it has multiple levels, which helps to incorporate the nonlinearity of the agro-hydrological system. More details regarding the design of multi-level pseudorandom inputs can be found in our previous work [11]. Figure 3 presents a segment of the training input signal and the corresponding output for M2, which is generated by simulating the discrete ODE system 6 and the algebraic equation 7. Note that a random noise signal ϵ is added to the output trajectory to mimic real process operations, which is shown in Figure 3(b) in red. The max magnitude of ϵ is defined as follows: ϵ max =0.1[ y max − y min ] View Source where ymax and ymin are the maximum and minimum value of the system output in the dataset. All datasets need to be reorganized to match the input-output structure of the NNs. Scaling is also required such that the magnitudes of the scaled data are less than 1. All simulations are carried out in Python and TensorFlow [14] is used to train the NNs. Readers may refer to [11] for more details regarding data pre-processing and NN training. Fig. 4. A sector of the training dataset of MA Show All C. Data Generation - Second Layer The second layer of the proposed framework consists of a fully-connected NN equivalent to the following nonlinear function: m A : R 3 → R 1 View Source The inputs to model MA are the one-step-ahead predictions of the system output made by M1, M2 and M3, while the output is the actual system output prediction. Under the objective of predicting the system output over the entire operating range of interest, the training dataset of MA covers the entire operating range. A section of the training dataset including 100000 points is presented in Figure 4, where the input signal and the corresponding output trajectories without and with white noise added are shown. Compared to those used for sub-models training, this dataset spans all the sub-operating regions with more aggressive dynamics. Note that an impulse irrigation signal is used to provide a more aggressive output response that varies in a larger operating range, which is desired for MA training. Similar to that discussed in the previous section, reconstruction and scaling is done for this dataset. Following the pre-treatment, the dataset is fed to the pre-identified sub-models. The predictions made by the sub-models are collected, which are the designed inputs for MA and are used to train MA. SECTION IV. Model Validation The prediction performance of the proposed framework is validated in this section. The sub-models are validated first in IV-A. The proposed framework is then compared with a single LSTM in IV-B. The maximum number of prediction steps of step is N = 20 for this work. A. First Layer The multi-step-ahead prediction performances of M 1 − M 3 are presented in this section. Validation datasets are obtained in similar manners as the training datasets. 20% white noise is added to the system output of the validation data, which helps to test the performance of the models. At any given time step, noise-treated system input-output data are fed to the model for one-step-ahead prediction. Starting from the second step, the prediction made by the model at the previous step will be used as the initial condition of the current step. This procedure is repeated 20 times, providing twenty-steps-ahead predictions. TABLE II NRMSE of Multi-Step-Ahead-Predictions of the Sub-Models Table II summarizes the normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) of the multi-step-ahead predictions in the desired operating range of each model. The NRMSE is defined as follows: NRMSE=( y max − y min ) −1 ∑ t f i=1 ( y act (i)− y pred (i) ) 2 t f − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − √ (8) View Source where tf is the total number of validation data points, yact and ypred are the true and predicted system outputs respectively. Figures 5, 6, and 7 present the multi-step-ahead open-loop prediction performance of M1, M2, and M3 respectively. In all three figures, the black curves represent the actual output trajectories. The solid blue curves, dash-dotted red curves, and dashed yellow curves are the single-step-ahead, ten-step-ahead, and twenty-step-ahead predictions respectively. All three models provide reasonable multi-step-ahead prediction without delays in the presence of noise. For M1, small prediction offsets can be observed in Figure 5 when the value of the system output is low. Figure 6 shows only some minor offsets exist at the local extremes for M2. For both M1 and M2, the effect of noise seems to be minor. In Figure 7, the noise has a stronger impact on the single-step-ahead prediction especially when the output converge to steady-states. As the number of prediction steps increases, the effect of the noise deviates and becomes insignificant. Similar to M1 and M2, M3 also has some minor offsets at the local extremes. For different operating ranges, the system output dynamics are different. When the soil moisture content and the irrigation rate is low, the system does not have obvious steady-states (Figure 5). As the operating range shifts to the higher magnitude side, the soil moisture content tends to saturate to steady-states (Figure 7). B. The Proposed Framework The multi-step-ahead prediction performance of the proposed framework is investigated in this section, where an LSTM is used as the benchmark approximation model. The same validation dataset is used to compare the performance of the two approximation approaches, which spans the entire operating range of interest. Figure 8 and 9 present the open-loop prediction trajectory of the system output based on the benchmark LSTM and the proposed framework respectively. The single-step-ahead, ten-step-ahead, and twenty-step-ahead predictions are presented in each Figure with the same line style as introduced in the previous section. The NRMSE values under the two cases and the percentage difference △ between them are summarized in table III. The percentage difference is calculated with respect to the NRMSE of the benchmark LSTM: Δ= NRMS E LSTM −NRMS E proposed NRMS E LSTM View Source Fig. 5. Multi-step-ahead prediction performance of M1. Show All Fig. 6. Multi-step-ahead prediction performance of M2. Show All Fig. 7. Multi-step-ahead prediction performance of M3. Show All Fig. 8. Multi-step-ahead prediction performance of an single LSTM. Show All Fig. 9. Multi-step-ahead prediction performance of the 2-layer NN framework. Show All TABLE III NRMSE of Multi-Step-Ahead-Predictions of the NN Models As presented in Figure 8, the LSTM can respond to sharp changes efficiently without delays. However, significant offsets are observed at the local minimums and the local maximums with larger magnitudes. A small section of the trajectories is amplified, which can be seen on the top-right corner of Figure 8. In the zoomed-in plot, significant offsets can be observed in both the local maximum and the minimum. Better prediction performance is observed in Figure 9. To be specific, the proposed 2-layer framework can capture the dynamics at the local minimums much better compared to the LSTM. From the zoomed-in window on the top right, it can be observed that the predictions of the local minimum and maximum are more accurate compared to the LSTM. Table III indicates matching results, showing that the NRMSE values of the proposed framework are significantly lower than that obtained with the LSTM for all number of prediction steps. The improvement of the proposed framework is more significant when the number of prediction steps is low and slowly reduces as the prediction steps increase. It is noticed that the proposed framework cannot accurately approximate the local maximums with larger magnitudes. To account for this problem, we introduce a bias-and-scale-updated model to capture the plant-model-mismatch, of which the details are provided in the following section. SECTION V. Plant-Model-Missmatch Correction To capture the plant-model-missmatch, two correction approaches are investigated based on the proposed 2-layer NN framework. The first approach is to add a simple bias term b1 based on the prediction error: y act = C 1 ( y pred )=ypred+ b 1 (9) View Source The second approach is to fit a first order linear model that maps the predicted output to the actual measurement: y act = C 2 ( y pred )=a.ypred+ b 2 (10) View Source where a and b2 are parameters to be identified. The parameters are updated at a certain frequency for both approaches. In the following subsections, the detailed updating policies of the two approaches are first introduced, followed by results comparison. A. Single Bias Term The step-by-step updating policy of the bias term b1 is summarized as follows: Determine the updating frequency fu of the parameter. Note that fu should be a divisor of N. Initialize time t = 1. Provide the initial condition N N in (t) to the 2-layer NN framework. Initialize b1 with some guess. Here b 1 =0 is used. Initialize the step counter i=1 , y pred (0)= y act (t) Simulate the 2-layer NN framework and record the prediction y pred (i) . Pass the raw prediction through the correction model C1: y ^ pred (i)= y pred (i)+ b 1 View Source Save the prediction error η(i) . Note that yact is obtained by simulating the discretized Richards equation ahead of time. η(i)= y act (t+i)− y ^ pred (i) View Source Update i=i+1 . If i is divisible by fu, update b1: b 1 = 1 f u ∑ j=i− f u +1 i η(j) View Source If i<N , update t=t+1 . Return to step 3. Terminate when t> t f , where tf is the total number of data available. B. Linear Model The step-by-step updating policy of the linear model parameters a and b2 is summarized as follows: Determine the updating frequency fu. Note that fu should be a divisor of N. Initialize time t = 1. Provide the initial condition N N in (t) to the 2-layer NN framework. Initialize a and b2 with some guess. Here a=1 , b 2 =0 is used. Initialize the step counter i=1 , y pred (0)= y act (t) Simulate the 2-layer NN framework and record the prediction y pred (i) . Pass the raw prediction y pred (i) through the correction model C2 and save y ^ pred (i) : y ^ pred (i)=a⋅ y pred (i)+ b 2 View Source Update i=i+1 . If i is divisible by fu, update a and b2 by solving the following optimization problem: min a, b 2 ∑ i− f u +1 i [ y act (t+j)−(a⋅ y ^ pred (j)+ b 2 )] (11a) View Source a∈A (11b) View Source b 2 ∈B (11c) View Source where (11b-11c) are constraints on the parameters, A and B are compact sets. If i > N, update t = t + 1. Return to step 3.. Terminate when t> t f , where tf is the total number of data available. Note that to find a and b2, an optimization problem is solved such that a and b2 are bounded in a reasonable range. The optimization problem is solved in Python using CasADi [15]. TABLE IV Performance of the Mismatch Correction Approach In Terms of Average Absolute Error C. Results Comparison Recall the prediction horizon of interest N = 20. Thus updating frequencies f = 1,2,5,10 are tested and compared, of which the results are summarized in table IV. The performance is measured using the average absolute prediction error vmm: v mm = 1 N⋅ t f ∑ t f ∑ N | y act − y ^ pred | View Source where the same definitions are kept for all variables. For f = 5, 10, the single-bias correction approach leads to more significant errors and is not applicable. The linear model correction shows very minor performance improvements. When f = 2, similar improvements in the prediction performance are observed in both approaches. When f = 1, the single bias correction performs similarly as when f = 2. For the linear model correction, f = 1 is not applicable. Considering the computational complexity of the two approaches, the single bias correction with f = 2 is selected. SECTION VI. Conclusion and Future Works In this work, motivated by the impractical computational cost of first-principle-based advanced control, a data-driven 2-layer NN framework is proposed to approximate the complex nonlinear dynamics of the agro-hydrological system. The proposed framework is shown to have satisfactory open-loop prediction performance which outperforms a benchmark LSTM model. In future works, the advanced control of the proposed-framework in the presence of noise and weather disturbances will be investigated.

Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Unmanned aerial spraying systemVariable rate sprayingPrecision agricultureFlow rate controlSustainable farming 1. Introduction Rapid agricultural evolution has given rise to precision agriculture, meeting the global demand for sustainable and efficient food production (Yaqot et al., 2022). The fundamental principle of precision agriculture is to optimize resource utilization, enhance plant health, and promote environmental sustainability (Rusmayadi et al., 2023). The accurate application of agricultural inputs, particularly pesticides, plays a significant role in achieving these objectives across vast and diverse sectors (Meshram et al., 2021). Traditionally, the manual and uniform distribution of pesticides has resulted in excessive chemical usage and adverse environmental impacts. These limitations have been mitigated through the adoption of precision farming tools, such as GPS-guided equipment and data analytics. Unmanned aerial systems (UASs) are prominently utilized for pesticide spraying (Frankelius et al., 2017, Wang et al., 2022). Precision agriculture is a comprehensive farming approach that efficiently utilizes data, technology, and high-tech equipment to manage agricultural resources, including water, land, fertilizers, and pesticides (Karunathilake et al., 2023). It enables the precise application of inputs at specific locations, ensuring that each part of the field receives the necessary nutrients, as opposed to conventional farming methods that treat an entire field uniformly. UASs, along with technologies such as satellite imagery, global positioning system (GPS), and geographic information system (GIS), are integrated to achieve this precision (Tayari et al., 2015). Precision agriculture heavily relies on Variable Rate Spraying (VRS) and its significance cannot be overstated. Conventional agricultural techniques result in pesticide overuse due to uncontrolled spraying, whereas VRS tailors pesticide spraying to meet the precise requirements of different locations within a field (Alam et al., 2020). By interpreting the data collected from sensors and integrating it with real-time environmental information, UASs adjust spray rates, coverage, and application patterns ensuring that pesticides and other inputs reach their intended locations with the required quantities. VRS positively impacts the environment and economy, reduces wasteful resource usage, enhances crop health, and minimizes waste from chemical production (Hussain et al., 2019). UASSs comprise a multi-rotor or a fixed-wing drone and are equipped with various components such as pesticide tanks, pumps, and nozzles to effectively dispense pesticides or fertilizers. They are also equipped with GPS and navigation technology to map the field accurately and follow predefined flight paths and maintain the required altitude and velocity. The operator can manually control UASSs using a remote control or set up the flight plan using software such as precision flight or drone deploy, enabling autonomous operations. They have become essential instruments in precision agriculture due to their precise spray capabilities (Hassler and Baysal-Gurel, 2019, Mukherjee et al., 2019; Yae et al., 2016). Fig. 1, Fig. 2 depict a DJI MG-1P eight-rotor electric UASS model (Shan et al., 2022) and an SG 10P eight-rotor UASS model (Hanif et al., 2023), respectively.

A SG 10P eight-rotor UASS model equipped with both manual and automatic controls used for spraying in agricultural fields. UASSs automate and enhance crop spraying, eliminating the need for manual labor and reducing human exposure to hazardous chemicals. For effective pest and disease management, UASSs are also equipped with various sensors and technologies, such as high-precision GPS and real-time kinematics (RTK). This enables UASSs to follow precise flight paths, ensuring accurate coverage during spraying. RTK provides centimeter-level accuracy, crucial for precision spraying (Ekaso et al., 2020, Hassler and Baysal-Gurel, 2019). UASSs reduce chemical use and pesticide overspray, resulting in cost savings and environmental benefits (Hassler et al., 2019). They operate at low altitudes with precise control, minimizing the spray drift caused by wind pressure and decreasing the risk of environmental contamination and unintended harm to neighboring crops (Chen et al., 2022). UASSs access complex field areas that are typically difficult for conventional ground-based equipment to access, ensuring even spray coverage across crops while adjusting pesticide flow rates for resource optimization and cost reduction (Ayamga et al., 2021, Lian et al., 2019). Furthermore, UASSs efficiently and rapidly disperse fertilizers, ensuring that crops receive the necessary minerals for healthier growth and increased harvest yields (Rahman et al., 2021), which reduce labor costs and fertilization process time (Ayamga et al., 2021). UASSs provide diverse agricultural benefits, including improved resource management, minimized pesticide usage, enhanced productivity, and early detection of crop issues. Pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers can be precisely sprayed by primarily regulating the flow rate to distribute appropriate amounts of inputs, ensuring high-yield, environmentally-conscious agriculture (Rahman et al., 2021). Precisely controlling the flow rate is vital for VRS, which is the primary objective of this review. VRS focuses on uniform input delivery via an intelligent, adaptable approach that considers the specific needs of each field region. Such precision allows farmers to enhance the efficiency of their inputs, reduce waste, and minimize environmental impact, increase productivity, promote environmental sustainability, and improve economic viability (Alam et al., 2020). Developing flow rate control techniques can enhance productivity, reduce chemical usage, improve crop health, and promote agricultural sustainability (Meshram et al., 2021). These technical advancements involve developing new tools and laying the foundation for a more prosperous and sustainable agricultural future (Frankelius et al., 2017). This review serves as a guide, highlighting the incredible advancements in VRS for precise spray requirements in precision agriculture using UASSs. The fundamentals of flow rate control mechanisms, data-driven approaches, practical applications, and significant challenges in precision agriculture are also discussed. This review provides a comprehensive understanding of the cutting-edge innovations that are reshaping traditional farming methods and highlights the potential for new development, encouraging further research and invention. This review has been meticulously structured to guide readers through the essential components of VRS using UASSs. Each section covers various aspects of UASS technology via thorough discussions and examples. Moreover, the innovative impact of precision agriculture is illustrated using a knowledge matrix. The review concludes with a summary of findings, highlighting the crucial role of precise spray control in precision agriculture and outlining future research directions for agricultural transformation. 2. Flow rate control methods 2.1. Conventional flow rate control systems Precision agriculture has witnessed notable developments, particularly related to flow rate control while spraying agricultural inputs. These developments are based on the fundamental principles of conventional flow rate control systems. These advancements in flow rate control are crucial for enhancing the precision and efficiency of input application in agriculture, directly impacting crop health and resource conservation. This section discusses conventional techniques, along with their operation principles and drawbacks. 2.1.1. Traditional methods for flow rate control Conventional flow rate control systems relied on mechanical components and manual adjustments. These adjustments included simple mechanical systems, valve settings, and fixed nozzles to regulate the flow rate of agricultural inputs during spraying. The flow rates, valve positions, and nozzle sizes were manually controlled based on predefined values or operators’ experience. Importantly, these parameters remained constant irrespective of the varying field conditions. 2.1.2. Limitations of conventional systems Conventional flow rate control systems have several limitations: they are inflexible and cannot adapt to changing environmental conditions. Moreover, the efficiency of input application is impacted by wind speed, wind direction, and manual control. Excessive doses may be applied to fields with high input requirements, leading to resource wastage and environmental harm (Abbas et al., 2020, Chen et al., 2020, Tewari et al., 2020). Conversely, undertreated areas may result in reduced agricultural yields. As conventional systems are manually operated, operators must constantly monitor and adjust parameters during spraying. This increases the potential for human errors and creates labor-intensive requirements. This lack of adaptability leads to inaccurate and inefficient spraying of inputs, consequently resulting in excessive or insufficient pesticide usage (Tewari et al., 2020). As a result, newer systems have been developed to address these shortcomings. The input application rates vary based on the operators’ expertise and experience, resulting in inconsistent crop protection and reduced yields. The flow rate management process of these methods cannot be integrated with real-time data, such as field conditions, crop health information, and meteorological data. Thus, efficient flow rate control mechanisms must be developed by leveraging technology, automation, and data-driven decision-making to overcome these challenges and revolutionize the spraying process (Chen et al., 2017). These developments and their significance will be further discussed in the following sections. 2.2. Decision support for flow rate in UASSs The integration of UASSs into precision agriculture has enabled innovative, flexible, and precise control of flow rates (Chen et al., 2022). Herein, the most recent advancements that revolutionize flow rate control and adaptable and dynamic methods for precision spraying are discussed. 2.2.1. Innovations and technologies improving flow rate control Artificial intelligence (AI) systems can process and analyze large datasets in real-time by gathering data from various sources, including meteorological conditions, field variability, crop health, and past performance, to make data-driven and adaptive decisions. Such systems can be used to control the flow rate and quickly adapt to varying conditions such as input requirements and wind speed variations (Liu et al., 2021; Sanchez et al., 2023). Machine learning (ML) models can learn from existing data and generate predictive algorithms that estimate the optimal flow rates based on different parameters. This predictive control is particularly valuable in dynamic agricultural environments. ML models continuously enhance their predictions by learning from the accumulated data, yielding precise and effective flow rate adjustments (Ayoub et al., 2022, Yanlie et al., 2016). Alam et al. (2020) used random forest classifier to detect and classify weeds. Their classification model was initially trained offline using an image dataset before testing in the field. An application device equipped with a pulse width modulation (PWM)–based fluid flow controller and a vision-based feedback system was used to spray the required input quantity. AI enables highly personalized input applications based on the field characteristics and environmental parameters, such as crop health and soil conditions (Tewari et al., 2020). Liu et al. (2021) developed a ML-based variable-rate sprayer and assessed its performance by accurately spraying targeted weeds. They used deep learning techniques to categorize weeds in real-time. The variable-rate sprayer, designed to control the flow rate, comprises a camera for capturing images, a computer for analyzing photos, a microcontroller board for system control, and spray nozzles with solenoid valves. The system sends trigger signals based on real-time captured images to control the flow rate of the nozzles. Kotkar et al. (2021) presented an innovative approach of automated chemical spraying using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify crop illnesses using object identification, image preprocessing, segmentation, extraction, and categorization. 2.2.2. Benefits of advanced flow rate control The accuracy and versatility of modern flow rate control systems reduce the adverse impacts of agriculture on the environment. Minimizing waste and avoiding excessive chemical use contribute to environmentally friendlier and sustainable farming practices. Precision farming input application ensures that crops receive the exact care they require, preventing over- and under-treatment and enhancing crop resilience, health, and yield. Moreover, advanced flow rate control techniques have become increasingly automated, reducing manual oversight and workload and ensuring optimal farm management (Dou et al., 2018, Yanlie et al., 2016). 3. Advanced technologies for flow rate control Flow rates must be precisely controlled to enhance crop health, reduce wasteful use of resources, and optimize input distribution. Herein, the related cutting-edge technologies that ensure precise flow rate control and distribution of inputs in the field are discussed. 3.1. Electromechanical flow control Electromechanical systems have revolutionized precision agriculture by providing precision and flexibility in flow rate control. These systems are built on the fundamental concept of mechanical systems by integrating electrical inputs and combine mechanical and electrical components to control the agricultural input flow. For instance, electrically actuated valves that adjust feed rates for large-scale wheat farming based on variations in soil moisture content. Sensors provide real-time data on soil conditions, which enables these valves to precisely control the distribution of water and nutrients and maximize crop production while preserving resources (Luck et al., 2015). Fig. 3(a) refers to the electromechanical-based nozzle, i.e., solenoid-controlled nozzle and Fig. 3(b) shows the disassembled view of the nozzle with all the components labeled (Grisso et al., 2011).

Electromechanical phenomenon-based flow control nozzle: (a) fasting-acting, solenoid-controlled nozzle and (b) components of the solenoid-controlled nozzle. Electrostatic nozzles in precision agriculture have enhanced precision in spraying applications. By charging droplets, these nozzles increase the adhesion of pesticides to plants, leading to more efficient use of chemicals and reduced drift. For instance, they are utilized in vineyards to uniformly distribute pesticides on grapevines and reduce chemical drift, thereby yielding high-quality wines (Law, 1983, Law, 2001). Fig. 4 schematizes the electrostatic nozzle designed and developed by Patel et al. (2017) specifically for orchards, which ensures accurate co-axial alignment between the annular ring electrode and the nozzle, allowing for uniform spraying.

Intelligent flow control valves exemplify the synergy between precision agriculture and data-driven decision-making. Integrated with a network of sensors, these valves dynamically adjust flow rates in real-time while continuously monitoring field conditions. Sensors measure temperature, crop health, and soil moisture. Using these data, intelligent valves adjust irrigation rates to ensure plants receive appropriate amounts of water at the right time, thereby maximizing production and reducing water consumption. These control valves operate systematically by collecting information on crop health, weather, and soil moisture. They reduce the pressure in irrigation systems when rainfall is anticipated to prevent overwatering, whereas they increase the flow to ensure plants receive adequate water during a heatwave. The valve adjusts pesticide rates for concentrated application if the crop health sensors identify any illnesses. Such real-time automation optimizes crop health and resource utilization by making all necessary modifications automatically (Hussain et al., 2020, Sharda et al., 2015). Nasir et al. (2021) developed an intelligent pressure and flow rate control system for VRS based on proportional integral derivative (PID). Fig. 5 schematizes the intelligent flow rate control mechanism.

Pneumatic systems use air pressure to direct fluid flow based on the agricultural field. Such systems are used in citrus orchards, where the tree height and canopy density vary considerably. Pneumatic systems optimize resource utilization by automatically adapting input application rates to accommodate these variations and ensure uniform coverage (Zhu et al., 2006). The compressed air flow in these systems is regulated by specially designed valves and regulators. The released air changes the system pressure, ultimately governing the input flow. Sensors that monitor changes in air pressure, altitude, or other pertinent variables are connected to this system. To guarantee a steady and accurate input supply, the system adjusts the pressure and airflow as it detects deviations, such as different terrains or atmosphere conditions (Al-Gaadi et al., 2023). 3.2. Precision nozzles and valves A key element of VRS is the selection of suitable nozzles and valves to ensure that the flow rates of inputs are precisely adjusted to the specific needs of crops. The effect of these components on enhancing the effectiveness of VRS is discussed herein. 3.2.1. Specialized nozzles and valves for VRS Specialized nozzles and valves are versatile and meet the evolving modern farming demands. These specialized components are used in large citrus farms and dynamically adjust input application rates based on the fruit load and tree size. For larger, leafy trees receive more quantity of pesticide and nutrients, ensuring uniform coverage and optimal fruit quality. In contrast, smaller trees require less pesticide quantity, preventing the overuse of resources by the use of specialized nozzles and valves (Berenstein et al., 2017; Dou et al., 2018, Garcera et al., 2017). The varieties of specialized nozzles are discussed in subsequent sections. 3.2.2. Dual-Nozzle systems for targeted spraying Dual-nozzle systems are distinctive because they have two nozzles with different flow rates, allowing targeted and synchronized spraying. The dual-nozzle systems used in apple orchards have specialized nozzles with distinct spray patterns and droplet sizes (Lu et al., 2022). There are two types of nozzles: one designed for spraying leaves and the other for soil-applied pesticides. These nozzles are strategically arranged to ensure that inputs are precisely delivered to the tree canopy areas. These systems enhance pesticide distribution and reduce overlap in pesticide spraying (Lyle et al., 1986). 3.2.3. Variable orifice nozzles for adaptive control Variable orifice nozzles precisely adjust the diameter of the nozzle orifice using a manual actuator and control the flow rate of agricultural inputs, such as fertilizers and insecticides. The nozzle can mechanically expand or compress the orifice aperture using a screw mechanism or a variable-curvature design, allowing it to rapidly adapt to changing needs (Fulton et al., 2016). In more advanced applications, variable-orifice nozzles are used with electronic controls. These systems change the orifice diameter in real-time in response to the data obtained from sensors or remote-control devices. Automated responsiveness to changing conditions in the field and greater precision in flow rate changes are two benefits of electronic control (Luck et al., 2015). Fig. 7 shows the conceptual design and the working model of a variable orifice nozzle, (a) schematizes the variable orifice nozzle and its components (Bui, 2005) and (b) shows the actual image of a variable orifice nozzle (Luck et al., 2010).

Variable orifice nozzle for adaptive control (a) schematic of a variable-orifice nozzle with its components labeled and (b) actual image of the variable orifice nozzle. 3.3. Real-Time monitoring and feedback systems Real-time monitoring and feedback systems use a wide range of sensors and actuators to adapt to varying field conditions, and the construction of sensors varies depending on the desired application (Cruvinel et al., 2016). 3.3.1. Sensors and systems providing Real-Time feedback Weather Sensors: These electronic devices include thermometers for recording temperature information, hygrometers for tracking humidity, and anemometers for measuring wind speed. Designed to endure external elements, they can provide precise meteorological data (Kumar et al., 2020). The integration of weather sensors is crucial for the real-time decision-making of UASSs. Specialized weather sensors are strategically incorporated into the system, continuously monitoring key weather parameters, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation. For instance, the system adjusts spray rates in high temperatures to prevent evaporation, ensuring precise delivery. If wind speeds surpass safety thresholds, UASSs alter their flight path to prevent overspray. Similarly, precipitation detection prompts an automatic suspension of spraying, preserving product efficacy and minimizing environmental impact (Faiçal et al., 2014). Sensors for measuring soil moisture: These devices are often fabricated using robust components and include probes that are buried to gauge the moisture content at different depths, designed for extended use in fields, they endure harsh conditions (Alwis et al., 2013, Lekshmi et al., 2014). By seamlessly integrating soil moisture sensors, UASSs optimize variable-rate spraying strategies based on precise soil conditions. These sensors continuously measure soil moisture levels throughout the field, and the data are transmitted to the onboard AI-driven system to enable VRS. In areas with low soil moisture, the AI system may dynamically increase spray rates to enhance crops’ water retention and nutrient absorption (Duangsuwan et al., 2020). Fig. 8 refers various types of soil moisture sensors, typically compact, cost-effective, and precise. Certain models are combined with sensors for soil temperature and salinity, while others incorporate dataloggers and radio communication systems for easier installation and retrieval in the field (Cahn & LF, 2017).

Fig. 9 shows a schematic that illustrates the integration of various sensors and feedback mechanisms for the implementation of smart farming. Smart sensors enable precise monitoring of environmental factors, including temperature, moisture, and humidity. Certain sensors are capable of evaluating soil quality by measuring nitrate levels and water content. Detection of plant diseases and insect pests is achieved through high-resolution cameras. UAV-based surveillance facilitates continuous monitoring of crop growth and farm land topology. Automated mass flow sensors are employed to estimate crop production accurately (Rajak et al., 2023).

Schematic of the integration of various sensors and feedback mechanisms for the implementation of smart farming. 3.3.2. Intelligent sensors for flow rate control Intelligent sensors control flow rate control using ML algorithms, deep learning models, and microprocessors by analyzing the incoming data. Intelligent sensors can facilitate efficient data transfer to control systems by installing wireless communication modules (Paul et al., 2022). Operators can remotely adjust these sensors to changing circumstances. For instance, intelligent sensors with advanced ML techniques are employed in vineyards to identify potential signs of illness or increased insect impact. These sensors can be configured remotely and have solid wireless connectivity, allowing for quick and effective flow rate control (Talaviya et al., 2020). In regions with lower soil moisture indicative of potential dryness stress, the system autonomously increases the flow rate for targeted irrigation and optimized nutrient delivery. Conversely, in areas with higher soil moisture levels that indicate ample hydration, the system adeptly lowers the flow rate, avoids over-application, and conserves resources. 3.3.3. Wireless communication for data transmission Wireless communication systems are designed for long-range connectivity across a diversified agricultural field, transferring real-time data from sensors positioned throughout the field to a centralized control unit. They also have redundant data routes and communication protocols to ensure reliable data transmission even in challenging conditions. Data sent across wireless communication technologies are encoded to prevent unauthorized access, and a reliable safety feature is included in their design (Feng et al., 2019). Fig. 10 shows a wireless communication-based data transmission system designed for crop health monitoring in conjunction with remote sensing (Shafi et al., 2019). Download : Download high-res image (474KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 10. Wireless communication-based data transmission system. For instance, the integration of radio frequency (RF) and satellite-based wireless communication ensures seamless data transmission and enhanced precision of variable-rate applications. With its diverse frequency bands and reliable short-range capabilities, RF communication facilitates direct line-of-sight data exchange between the UASS and the ground control station (Proshkin et al., 2021). This proves advantageous in scenarios where real-time updates on crop conditions are vital for dynamic decision-making during the flight. Simultaneously, satellite-based communication provides a broader reach, particularly in remote or expansive agricultural areas where traditional communication infrastructure may be lacking. Leveraging satellite links, UASSs used for VRS can transmit real-time data to and from the ground control system. This global connectivity ensures continuous and uninterrupted communication, allowing respective systems to make instantaneous adjustments to the VRS parameters based on the latest information received from the field (Islam et al., 2021, Matese et al., 2015, Radoglou-Grammatikis et al., 2020). 3.3.4. Closed-Loop control systems for dynamic adjustments Closed-loop control systems integrate hardware and software for real-time dynamic adjustments to the flow rate. These systems are equipped with highly advanced software that consolidates information from various sources and sensors for real-time analysis and decision-making. Hardware components, such as controllers and actuators, endure environmental conditions and ensure accurate and swift changes to flow rate. Adaptive algorithms are a feature of closed-loop control systems, allowing them to adjust to the temporal variation in agricultural field conditions. These algorithms are designed to be efficient and adaptable. In large-scale potato farming, these systems are used with advanced software, such as Agrosense, which uses data from meteorological stations to adjust the flow rates (Katamreddy et al., 2019, Kruize et al., 2014). These systems operate dynamically owing to the closed-loop structure and continuously refine decisions based on the latest data inputs. This results in a responsive and adaptive approach to VRS, where the UASS becomes an agile decision-making entity, finely tuning its actions to the specific needs of each part of the field. Closed-loop control systems incorporate several sensors on the UASS, capturing data on crop health, soil conditions, and environmental factors (Hafeez et al., 2023, Hao et al., 2022). As the flight traverses the field, the closed-loop system processes these data and compares them against predefined parameters (Faiçal et al., 2017). 3.3.5. Integration with Unmanned aerial vehicle navigation for precise delivery Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) navigation systems have sophisticated algorithms and GPS technology, enabling precise navigation in specific areas. The design of these systems guarantees accurate placement and movement control (Maddikunta et al., 2021). The real-time communication between flow rate control systems and UAVs forms the foundation of their integration. Strong communication links are incorporated into these systems to ensure uninterrupted contact throughout the navigation process. Dynamic adjustment algorithms are built into the flow rate control systems and UAV navigation systems, allowing for real-time adjustments to flow rates based on data and feedback. For instance, in a large-scale soybean farm, this integration ensures that UAVs use real-time data and GPS coordinates to dynamically adjust the pace at which pesticides are sprayed as they explore different field portions. This design optimizes resource utilization and increases crop yield by enabling precise distribution to specific locations (Garre and Harish, 2018, Xue et al., 2016). 4. Data-Driven approaches for flow rate control 4.1. AI in flow rate control Precision agriculture now relies significantly on AI (Bhat et al., 2021), particularly for flow rate control. AI technologies improve the distribution of agricultural inputs, ensuring they target crops with unprecedented precision and reduce waste. ML can regulate the flow rate of pesticides and herbicides based on real-time data using trained algorithms for efficient spraying and reduced costs. 4.1.1. Application of ML algorithms 4.1.1.1. Supervised learning for flow rate prediction Precision agriculture extensively uses supervised learning (Sharma et al., 2021), particularly for predicting the ideal pesticide and fertilizer spraying flow rates. Crop-specific models are a notable application of this technology, which are finely tuned to meet the crop needs (Alam et al., 2020). For instance, a supervised learning model is developed for soybean cultivation using historical data and real-time insights. This model considers crop development phases, meteorological circumstances, insect frequency, and indications of the health of individual plants (Yoosefzadeh-Najafabadi et al., 2020). Based on the continuous integration of data from weather stations, aerial vehicles, and gauges, the model forecasts precise flow rates required for accurate pesticide application. Supervised ML involves collecting extensive datasets containing crop types, vegetation indices, weather conditions, and historical spraying records. These datasets are used to train the machine-learning model (Guo et al., 2020). For instance, the model is trained to recognize patterns correlating specific vegetation indices with optimal pesticide concentrations. The algorithm refines its internal parameters based on the provided dataset during training. It learns to identify intricate relations between input features and the desired output, which, in the context of VRS, could be the optimal flow rate and spray pattern for a given set of field conditions (Patil et al., 2023). 4.1.1.2. Unsupervised learning for pattern recognition Unsupervised learning is a data-driven method that can provide insights into complicated farming systems for pattern detection (Liakos et al., 2018). Focused, precise farming techniques can be implemented based on this approach by identifying minute correlations and trends in agricultural data, ensuring efficient resource utilization, and minimizing ecological impacts (Priya et al., 2020). Unsupervised learning is commonly used for cultivating row crops to identify weed trends across farms, particularly for maize and soybeans (Louargant et al., 2018). The differences in plant density and colors are analyzed using the information collected by sensors and UAVs. By identifying weed clusters and their sequences of dispersion, the system can initiate concentrated pesticide applications (Gnädinger et al., 2017). Unsupervised ML techniques, particularly clustering algorithms such as k-means, are used to segment the agricultural field into distinct zones based on similarities in environmental characteristics. The algorithm autonomously identify patterns in the data and segments the field without any guidance (Badapanda et al., 2022). Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning operates without predefined output labels. In the context of VRS, the algorithm adapts to the variabilities of the field. 4.1.2. Ai-based optimization of flow rates 4.1.2.1. Neural network models for adaptive control While predictive models are not the sole focus of AI, adaptive control systems can dynamically adjust flow rates based on real-time conditions. Disease detection in vineyards is revolutionizing owing to neural network models, particularly CNN. Real-time information from multispectral cameras installed on UAVs is processed using these models, particularly for early disease detection (Tsouros et al., 2019). By analyzing the multispectral camera images, symptoms such as powdery mildew on grapevines can be detected (Knauer et al., 2017). When a disease is identified, the dynamic spray system accurately applies pesticides to the affected regions. This reduces the amount of chemicals used and ensures good health of the harvested grapes, a crucial factor for producing high-quality wines (Hao et al., 2022). 4.1.2.2. Reinforcement learning in precision spraying Reinforcement learning is revolutionizing precision spraying, particularly in Weed management, by enabling decision-making regarding the use of insecticides and other chemicals using real-time information and feedback (Gautron et al., 2022). UASSs that use reinforcement learning algorithms are used in cotton plantations to modify herbicide treatment rates based on the assessment of weed concentration. This continuous adaptation ensures efficient weed control while minimizing the use of pesticides. It represents an innovative, method of optimizing flow rates, ensuring pesticides are applied only when necessary and reducing their adverse effects on the ecosystem (Gao et al., 2019). 4.2. Integration of remote sensing data 4.2.1. Incorporating UAV-Collected data for precision spraying decisions Precision spraying decision-making depends on data, such as remote sensing data, particularly for flow rate control (Huang et al., 2018). This approach integrates advanced technology and data analytics. UAVs are equipped with advanced sensors that capture real-time data related to crop health, pest infestations, and soil conditions (Jia et al., 2021). This unique data collected during each flight serve as the foundation for data-driven decisions that optimize VRS. 4.2.1.1. Multispectral data for crop health Multispectral cameras equipped with UAVs gather real-time data on the field by capturing spectral bands corresponding to distinct plant properties (Deng et al., 2018). Fig. 11 (a) shows a UAV equipped with a multispectral camera for crop health monitoring (De Oca et al., 2018), (b) illustrates the integration of the multispectral camera, thermal camera, Red, Green and Blue (RGB) camera, and global navigation satellite system (GNSS) with the Raspberry Pi, while (c) shows the overall assembly of all the components acquired for the Data Acquisition System (DAS) (Xu et al., 2021).

Spectral data-based crop health monitoring system: (a) UAV equipped with a multi-spectral camera for crop health assessment, (b) components integrated with Raspberry Pi, and (c) assembly of components forming the DAS. The information gathered by these cameras are analyzed for flow rate control. AI software such as Agisoft Metashape or Pix4D are used to process multispectral data. These software programs have built-in ML algorithms developed based on extensive datasets and can identify signatures associated with various factors, including crop health, insect frequency, and nutritional deficits (Wang et al., 2021). For instance, software such as Agisoft Metashape analyzes multispectral data, while a UAV with a multispectral camera hovers over the crops. Depending on these spectral characteristics, field areas with increased insect populations or nutritional deficits are identified (Velusamy et al., 2021). The AI models of the software then adjust the flow rates of connected sprayers based on the previous processed image data (Linhui et al., 2019). This data-driven method reduces waste, maximizes crop health, and minimizes negative environmental impact.

Hyperspectral imaging for disease detection In VRS, hyperspectral imaging is used for early disease detection in crops. Hyperspectral cameras capture data in numerous narrow spectral bands, providing highly detailed information about the field condition (Moghadam et al., 2017), which are used for disease detection. Fig. 13 shows the hyperspectral imaging used for the disease detection, (a) shows the visual representation of a fungal plant disease, and (b) illustrates spikelets caused by Fusarium head blight, detected using hyperspectral imaging (Mahlein, 2016).

Visual representation of (a) fungal plant disease and (b) detection of spikelets caused by Fusarium head blight using hyperspectral imaging. The data collected via hyperspectral imaging are processed using advanced AI models and specialized software, such as MATLAB and ENVI. The solutions are designed to recognize spectral patterns associated with various diseases, enabling early disease detection (Li et al., 2022). After the hyperspectral images are captured, the software analyzes the data, identifying potential disease patterns in the field. With the help of integrated software, the system initiates targeted spraying to the affected areas (Khan et al., 2021). This precise approach optimizes disease control and minimizes the need for excessive chemical application. 4.2.2. Fusion of sensor data for enhanced Decision-Making For VRS, the data obtained from various sensors are integrated to understand the field condition and ensuring the precise decision-making and application of pesticides and fertilizers (Zanin et al., 2022). 4.2.2.1. Combining Light detection and ranging data for terrain mapping Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) technology captures precise 3D terrain data (Lin et al., 2021, Lin and Habib, 2021). The LiDAR data are processed in real-time using specialized software, such as Ag Leader SMS (Feng et al., 2019), which uses AI-driven algorithms to create an accurate 3D terrain map of the field. This map is used for calculating the variable rate prescription for each section of the field based on elevation variations (Potena et al., 2019). Fig. 14(a) shows a UAV-based system mounted with LiDAR system for terrain mapping (Banerjee et al., 2019). Fig. 14(b) shows the UAV-based mobile mapping system for the collection of the LiDAR data in a forest plantation under various leaf cover scenarios (Lin et al., 2021, Lin and Habib, 2021).

LiDAR data-based decision-making system: (a) integrated UAV-LiDAR for terrain mapping and (b) UAV-based mobile mapping system for collecting LiDAR data in a forest plantation under various leaf cover scenarios. This integration of LiDAR data guarantees that the spraying operation is finely tuned to the field topography (Ahmed et al., 2021), leading to minimized resource usage and optimized agricultural yields. 4.2.2.2. Integration with UASS navigation for precise delivery in VRS UASS navigation systems use AI-driven control software to ensure accurate and efficient spraying of pesticides and fertilizers. UASS is equipped with a GNSS and can perform highly accurate positioning and path planning. Integrating these navigation systems and RTK-GPS, such as Trimble’s RTK systems or DJI’s D-RTK GNSS, provides centimeter-level accuracy (Andanaputra et al., 2020). Flight planning and control software, such as Pix4D is also used to plan precise flight paths and manage respective operations (Hasheminasab et al., 2020). As the system follows the defined flight path, the AI-driven control software, often integrated into the flight controller or a companion computer, considers the specific variable rate prescription for each field section. For instance, the software might use a proprietary algorithm developed by the user to precisely activate and deactivate the payload such as a sprayer or dispenser. This ensures that the right amount of pesticide or fertilizer is delivered to match the field requirements (Agurob et al., 2023). 5. Case studies and applications 5.1. Real-World implementations of VRS with UASS The combined use of VRS and UASS has garnered significant recognition for its effectiveness in various agricultural settings. This section will investigate real-world applications of VRS, scrutinizing specific examples and the outcomes derived from deploying UASS in precision agriculture. 5.1.1. Examples of successful applications Lian et al. (2019) proposed a real-time control method for controlling the flow rate of an agricultural UAV spray system. The method used a single-chip microcomputer and micro diaphragm pump to precisely control the pump’s flow rate in real-time, enabling VRS based on different operating conditions. The system’s response speed was evaluated, demonstrating average control response and stability times of 0.18 and 0.75 s for pump flow changes. These results indicate that the system effectively responds to changes in operating conditions and can quickly adjust the pump’s target flow, achieving precise VRS. Thus, VRS systems can be implemented in agricultural UAVs. Liu et al. (2020) proposed a real-time control system for UAV VRS that uses a mathematical model to correlate flight speed, flight height, spray concentration, nozzle voltage, and spray volume, providing a theoretical foundation for research on aerial variable spray. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in accurately calculating spray volume based on parameter changes such as flight speed and height, maintaining a consistent spray concentration across farmland. This system effectively addressed uneven spray issues caused by fluctuating flight parameters by adjusting the real-time spray concentration to meet varying application needs and minimized pesticide waste due to over application of pesticides and under application. The system enhances spray accuracy, lays the groundwork for precision spraying, and reduces manual intervention, thereby improving application efficiency.

Aerial VRS system: (a) design of real-time control for the variable rate spraying system and, (b) Schematic of the hardware control system for the spraying. Wang et al. (2016) developed a pulse with modulation (PWM)-based VRS system. Droplet deposition was studied using the droplet concentration method while the UAV hovered under controllable multi-speed conditions. The system comprises an airborne spraying device, ground measurement, and control unit. The airborne spraying device, equipped with the STM32F103VC MCU, was remotely controlled by the ground measurement and control unit developed by LabWindows/CVI through a wireless data transmission module. The micro-electric diaphragm pump was controlled using a square wave of 10 Hz and an adjustable duty ratio. Then, the pressure and flow rate of the system were adjusted. Experiments were conducted under various distance and wind speed conditions to establish the relation between deposition volume, duty ratio, nozzle type, and the rotating speed of the centrifugal nozzle.

Wen et al. (2018) developed a VRS system to address the varying severity of plant diseases and insect pests in different locations. The system used a STMicroelectronics-32 (STM32) chip as the control system core and used a sensor to obtain real-time prescription values from prescription diagrams. A variable duty cycle pulse square wave was generated to adjust the flow rate, and a closed-loop PID control algorithm was employed to minimize the settling time of the system. Experimental results demonstrated that the system maintained a stable flow rate within 2.16 % of the target value, enabling VRS for diverse requirements. Here, the 2.16 % value signifies the system's consistent achievement of a flow rate very close to the intended target, highlighting its precision in adapting to diverse requirements. This narrow deviation underscores the system’s effectiveness in responding to varying severity of plant diseases and insect pests in different locations. Outdoor tests confirmed the effectiveness of the system in promptly adjusting the flow rate based on prescription map values, maintaining consistent droplet deposition, and achieving uniform deposition density within the operation unit.

Outcomes and benefits in precision agriculture VRS and UASS have transformed precision agriculture. VRS facilitates targeted spraying by leveraging UASS, allowing farmers to optimize crop health management practices (Ahmad et al., 2020). This newfound precision enhanced farm productivity, thereby improving yields and crop quality (Mogili et al., 2018). UASS-based VRS is ecofriendly as it reduces pesticide consumption and has targeted application, aligning with global sustainable farming practices. UASS-based VRS is a catalyst for enhanced crop yields and a contributor to sustainable agriculture (Wen et al., 2019). 5.1.3. Specialty Crops: Optimizing pest control Specialty crops, ranging from delicate berries to high-value vegetables, demand customized pest management solutions. The uniform application of pesticides, a common practice in conventional agriculture, is inadequate for these diverse crops due to variations in plant size, spacing, and vulnerability to specific pests (Warneke et al., 2021). For precise and targeted pest control, UASS-based VRS can be used. UASS seamlessly adapts to the unique challenges of pest control in specialty crops. For instance, in vineyards where grapevines demand meticulous attention, UASS equipped with sophisticated sensors skillfully navigates intricate terrains, enabling the precise delivery of pesticides (Becce et al., 2021). This targeted approach not only optimizes the efficacy of pest control measures but also minimizes environmental impact by considerably reducing the overall volume of pesticides used. The versatility of VRS is exemplified in orchards with diverse topography. UAV equipped with high-resolution cameras and cutting-edge imaging capabilities can effectively pinpoint areas that require treatment, thereby maximizing resource efficiency and minimizing the risk of affecting non-targeted areas (Dubuis et al., 2023). This ability to adapt to varying conditions highlights the transformative potential of UASS-based VRS in optimizing orchard pest control practices. 5.2. Benefits and outcomes in precision agriculture 5.2.1. Increased crop yields and quality UASS-based VRS has revolutionized precision agriculture with its ability to optimize inputs for maximizing outputs (Delavarpour et al., 2021). Precision spraying, tailored to the specific needs of individual plants, mitigates the risks associated with pesticide underdosing and overdosing, offering a critical advantage in row crops (Pawase et al., 2023). Equipped with advanced sensors, UASS navigates the intricate spacing between plants in row crops, ensuring that each plant receives the optimal amount of treatment (Shi et al., 2016). Precision agriculture primarily focuses on enhancing the quality of agricultural products, and precise application of pesticides plays a pivotal role in achieving this goal. In vineyards, for example, the UASS equipped with high-resolution cameras precisely traverses the terrain, delivering targeted treatments that eliminate pests while minimizing chemical residues on grapes. This not only safeguards the quality of the crop but also aligns with consumer demand for sustainably produced and residue-free agricultural products (Chancia et al., 2021). 5.2.2. Reduced pesticide and resource usage The UASS does not rely solely on real-time environmental conditions but leverages pre- and post-flight data analytics during decision-making (Hunter et al., 2020). This comprehensive approach uses historical data and ML algorithms to optimize pesticide application based on a deep understanding of crop health and environmental conditions. Thus, UAS-based VRS effectively reduces pesticide usage without compromising on effectiveness (Chen et al., 2021). The integration of UASS and VRS in agriculture can catalyze holistic resource optimization. This strategic merging of technology and farming practices fosters a sustainable future where the responsible use of pesticides and resources becomes a cornerstone of modern agriculture (Seelan et al., 2003). 5.2.3. Environmental sustainability UASS is a safer, more efficient, and more precise alternative to traditional pesticide application methods. Farmers can considerably reduce the risk of exposure to harmful chemicals and minimize physical damage to crops by applying pesticides using drones (Damalas et al., 2011). Additionally, the UASS can effectively spray small, irregularly shaped fields that would be challenging or impossible to reach with ground sprayers or conventional agricultural aircraft (Wirawan et al., 2022). This technology is particularly beneficial for reducing the risk of pesticide contamination, particularly among applicators that rely on backpack sprayers (Morales-Rodríguez et al., 2022). Traditional pesticide application methods often require multiple tractors to pass through fields, increasing fuel consumption and emissions. UAS targets specific areas of a field, which considerably reduces the need of using a tractor; thus, UAS-based VRS is an ecofriendly alternative and sustainable (Mukherjee et al., 2019, Wang et al., 2020). 5.3. Technical considerations Despite its remarkable advancements, UASS-based VRS faces several challenges. This section delves into the technical, regulatory, and practical challenges encountered during its real-world implementation, providing valuable insights from these experiences. 5.3.1. Technical challenges faced in Real-World applications Sensor limitations pose a significant challenge to the implementation of VRS with UASS. The effectiveness of data collection devices is crucial because the spatial and spectral resolutions of sensors directly impact the precision of VRS (Lee et al., 2010). These challenges can be addressed by developing sensors with higher resolutions, improved accuracy, and broader spectral bandwidths (Basso et al., 2019). Agricultural landscapes present unique navigation challenges, necessitating advanced algorithms for path planning and obstacle avoidance to navigate diverse and dynamic environments. The demand for precise and adaptable navigation systems has propelled ongoing research to enhance the UASS autonomy, ensuring efficient and safe operation in the field (Vazquez-Carmona et al., 2022). The inherent variability of agricultural environments poses challenges in ensuring consistent and reliable operation for VRS. Factors such as fluctuating wind speeds and varying humidity levels can impact the accuracy of pesticide application. To address these challenges, environmental dynamics must be understood and adaptive systems that can respond to real-time changes in field conditions must be developed (Faiçal et al., 2017). 5.3.2. Regulatory compliance and safety considerations In the rapidly evolving field of precision agriculture, the UASS can potentially revolutionize agricultural practices. However, the integration of these innovations into existing regulatory frameworks poses a significant challenge (Rao et al., 2016). The dynamic nature of UASS often surpasses the pace of regulatory updates, necessitating adaptability and collaboration among industry stakeholders and regulatory bodies. Safety considerations are paramount in VRS as they form a crucial aspect of regulatory compliance. To ensure technological and personnel safety, aviation regulations, airspace restrictions, and effective risk mitigation strategies must be thoroughly understood (Ayamga et al., 2021). 5.3.3. Farmer adoption and training Technological advancements, cultural norms, and educational initiatives are a few factors that determine the adoption of UASS-based VRS. Farmers, the primary users of this transformative technology, hold the key to its widespread adoption. The initial stages of adoption are often met with hesitation, primarily due to unfamiliarity with the technology, concerns about its financial viability, and reluctance to deviate from established farming practices (Bai et al., 2022). The effectiveness of precision agriculture is influenced by farmers who have their own experiences and technological proficiency. By conducting training programs, farmers can adopt and benefit from this technology (Daberkow et al., 2003). For the long-term adoption of the UASS, farmers should be provided with continuous support mechanisms such as regular software updates, readily accessible troubleshooting resources, and easily contactable support channels that can instill confidence and promote self-sufficiency among farmers. Additionally, collaborative efforts between technology providers, agricultural extension services, and local communities can play a pivotal role in facilitating the adoption of UASS-based VRS into agricultural practices (Klauser et al., 2021). 5.3.4. Integration with crop monitoring and phenotyping Empowered by advanced sensors, UAVs have revolutionized crop monitoring, enabling high-resolution data acquisition in real-time. These drones are equipped with multispectral and hyperspectral sensors and provide farmers an unprecedented understanding of crop health, growth patterns, and potential stress factors (Lu et al., 2020, Tao et al., 2020). Following this comprehensive monitoring, UASS seamlessly transitions into VRS based on the prescription map acquired from UAV monitoring for precise and adaptable pesticide applications (Chia et al., 2020). Phenotyping, a cornerstone of modern agriculture, thoroughly evaluates plant traits and characteristics. UAVs play a pivotal role in phenotyping by capturing high-resolution imagery and multispectral data (Xie and Yang, 2020, Yang et al., 2017), providing farmers with valuable insights into plant health, stress responses, and genetic traits. 6. Challenges and future directions 6.1. Current challenges in flow rate control While UASS-based VRS holds promise, it encounters specific challenges such as sensor accuracy, data integration, and power management, which are crucial for its successful implementation in precision agriculture. This section delves into the intricate nuances of flow rate control and explores innovations that have potential to revolutionize precision agriculture. Further research and development are imperative to tackle the multifaceted challenges posed by precision agriculture demands in flow rate control in flow rate control. 6.1.1. Sensor accuracy and reliability For efficient VRS, high accuracy and reliability of sensors must be ensured. However, maintaining this precision within dynamic agricultural environments is difficult. Sensor drift and environmental influences on the sensor can be mitigated by sensor calibration. Advanced sensor materials, characterized by their excellent stability and resilience to external factors, are garnering research attention. Such materials will enable sensors to consistently and accurately acquire data over extended durations (Yadav et al., 2023). Sensors can drift over time, deviating from their calibrated state and introducing inconsistencies in data acquisition. Although sensor calibration is a fundamental element to ensure sensor accuracy, it presents significant challenges (Luo et al., 2023). Maintaining calibration efficacy in dynamic agricultural environments, characterized by fluctuating temperature, humidity, and other environmental parameters, is a persistent effort (Srbinovska et al., 2015). 6.1.2. Integration of multiple sensors The seamless integration of diverse sensor modalities into the flow rate control framework is challenging, which stems from the inherent heterogeneity of sensors used in precision agriculture. To harmoniously combine these sensors for VRS, cutting-edge technological innovations and deeper understanding of their intricate dynamics are crucial (Zhuang et al., 2023). The practical implementation of sensor fusion in VRS necessitates the seamless integration of diverse technologies. From the conventional optics capturing the visible spectrum to the advanced multispectral and hyperspectral sensors unveiling hidden biophysical properties, each sensor plays a unique and vital role in the composition (Anastasiou et al., 2023). LiDAR and radar add further depth and dimension, providing crucial data on terrain and vegetation structure (Ahmad et al., 2022). However, the real-time synchronization of disparate data streams, robust processing capabilities, and the construction of a unified and coherent dataset demand innovative solutions and a profound understanding of the strengths and limitations of each sensor (Camilli et al., 2007). 6.1.3. Power consumption and UASS payload constraints To ensure optimal performance of VRS systems in precision agriculture, the intricate power–payload challenge must be addressed. To this end, the energy efficiency of sensors and associated technologies must be maximized while ensuring sufficient payload capacity for extended UASS flight durations. The operational longevity of UASS depends on the energy efficiency (Wang et al., 2019). for which finite-capacity batteries must be replaced with energy-efficient technologies. Balancing power consumption and payload is important during extended missions, where achieving equilibrium between operational demands and available power reserves is paramount (Martin et al., 2022). 6.2. Regulatory considerations To successfully integrate UASS into precision agriculture, regulatory compliance must be ensured such that technological advancements align with the dynamic and evolving regulatory landscape governing pesticide spraying operations in agriculture (Giles, 2016). 6.2.1. Compliance with pesticide application regulations While revolutionizing crop management practices, precision agriculture introduces a complex regulatory consideration, particularly for pesticide application. Ensuring adherence to stringent regulations poses a significant challenge, demanding a seamless integration of precision spraying techniques with meticulous data recording, reporting, and analysis procedures (Petty & Chang, 2018). Moreover, robust data-driven tracking and validation systems are required to monitor compliance with pesticide application regulations. These systems must capture a comprehensive range of data, including pesticide type, application rate, target area, and environmental conditions. This data must then be meticulously analyzed to ensure compliance with regulatory standards and optimize spraying practices (Lewis et al., 1997). 6.2.2. Privacy and data security concerns The collection and utilization of vast amounts of agricultural data pose privacy and data security concerns (Kumar et al., 2021), therefore, a holistic approach to risk mitigation and responsible data handling practices such as robust data encryption methods, secure data transmission protocols, and transparent data management practices are required (Gupta et al., 2020). Ongoing developments in privacy-preserving technologies, such as federated learning and secure data aggregation, aim to strike a nuanced balance between data utility and individual privacy in precision agriculture (Chhikara et al., 2021). Regulatory frameworks need to evolve alongside these technological advancements, incorporating comprehensive guidelines that ensure data integrity while promoting the responsible use of agricultural data. Establishing clear standards for data anonymization and de-identification further contributes to building a regulatory environment that fosters innovation while safeguarding sensitive individual information (Dara et al., 2022). 6.3. Future innovations and developments Emerging challenges and related solutions must be understood to effectively manage flow rate control in UASS-based VRS. The future of precision agriculture is primed for transformative advancements driven by innovative solutions that will reshape the VRS landscape. Several approaches for flow rate control are being developed, paving the way for enhanced efficiency, sustainability, and precision in agricultural practices. 6.3.1. Advancements in sensor technology Precision agriculture depends on the precision and reliability of sensors. Studies are being conducted to expand sensor technology (Bogue, 2017), for enhanced data collection and optimized decision-making in UASS-based VRS applications. Nanoscale sensors can revolutionize data collection in precision agriculture and are garnering attention (Duhan et al., 2017). Microscopic sensors operating at the molecular level exhibit high sensitivity and responsiveness, facilitating real-time data acquisition with minimal environmental interference (Manjunatha et al., 2016). Leveraging their nanoscale and microscopic dimensions, along with their enhanced sensitivity, these sensors will enable more precise monitoring of environmental conditions and crop health, thereby enhancing the quality of VRS decisions. Furthermore, these sensors assist in mitigating challenges associated with sensor drift and calibration, allowing more accurate and reliable flow rate control in UASS-based VRS applications. Multispectral and hyperspectral sensors are undergoing transformative enhancements, revolutionizing data collection and decision-making in precision agriculture (Di Gennaro et al., 2022). The spectral range of these sensors will be expanded to comprehensively and intricately understand crop conditions. Advanced multispectral sensors can also be used to assess plant physiological parameters (Wang et al., 2018) and adjust flow rates based on crop health indicators. This approach will enhance the precision and efficacy of VRS and facilitate proactive and targeted pest management strategies. It will also optimize resource use and minimize environmental impact (Radoglou-Grammatikis et al., 2020). 6.3.2. Ai-driven flow rate optimization AI is being widely used for optimizing flow rate control. AI-powered algorithms integrate self-learning and adaptive capabilities into UASSs to enable faster decision-making in precision agriculture (Huang et al., 2018). ML models are continuously trained using vast datasets containing diverse environmental conditions, which empower UASSs to adjust flow rates based on crop requirements using prescription maps (Khan et al., 2021). Hyperspectral images offer a wealth of data on crop health and nutrient needs for every point in a field. Fig. 18 refers to the UAV based DAS used by Kuswidiyanto et al. (2023), in their study for the detection of downy mildew in kimchi cabbage. Download : Download high-res image (531KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 18. UAV-based DAS: (a) DJI Matrice 300 RTK as the UAV platform, with two cameras – a hyperspectral camera (Corning 410 MicroHSI) and another high-resolution RGB camera (Zenmuse P1)-for capturing images and (b) images acquired of the respective study field, i.e., kimchi cabbage, using the hyperspectral camera and the high resolution RGB camera. Later on, different models are trained based on the augmented dataset obtained from the prior study using UAV based DAS. The disease prediction results of the studied area can be obtained based on these models. These results can then serve as a prescription map for the UASS to optimize the pesticide flow rate according to the field’s requirement. Fig. 19 shows the aerial hyperspectral imaging, (a) shows the studied area for disease detection, while (b) and (c) refers to the prediction results of the respective studied area. In these figures, the green areas represent healthy plants, while the red areas indicate disease plants in the field (Kuswidiyanto et al., 2023).Hyperspectral images provide information on crop health and nutrient needs for every point in an agricultural field. However, due to limitations for real time analyzing the field and adjusting the flow rates in drone technology, directly applying fertilizer to each pixel is not feasible. Thus, image analysis must be performed to segment images into larger, workable zones (raster segments) such that the drone efficiently distributes fertilizers based on the requirements (Yu et al., 2022). Fig. 20 shows hyperspectral imaging-based system in conjunction with prescription details (a) refers to the fertilizer prescription chart for the agricultural drones, while (b) shows the experimental setup for the agricultural drone with the prescription map used in their study.This adaptability allows UASS to respond swiftly and effectively to changing crop health indicators. Predictive modeling, fueled by AI, facilitates proactive flow rate adjustments, minimizing the reliance on preset parameters and enhancing the overall efficiency and effectiveness of pesticide application. Therefore, AI is used to not only optimize flow rate control but also catalyze autonomous decision-making capabilities during VRS missions (Liu et al., 2020).

In addition, insufficient water supply and high rate of water loss due to evapotranspiration increases plant stress which often affects its growth and development. Therefore, to address this issues, this paper is aimed at developing a model predictive control (MPC) strategy for water saving drip irrigation experiment that will regulate the soil moisture content within the desired field capacity and above the wilting point, while scheduling irrigation to replace the loss of water from soil and plant due to evapotranspiration in the greenhouse environment. The controller design involves a data driven predictive model identified and integrated with the MPC designer in MATLAB and thereafter exported in Simulink for simulation. The generate controller code was modified and deployed on a Raspberry Pi 4 controller to generate a pulse width modulated signal to drive the pump for the control water mixed with fertilizer. To achieve enhancement of controller an Internet of Things (IoT) integration was used for easy soil, weather, and plant monitoring which are used to update the MPC model for the irrigation control. The performance of the proposed MPC controller deployed drip irrigated Greenhouse(GH1) is benchmarked against an existing automatic evapotranspiration (ETo) model based controller in Greenhouse(GH2), with each greenhouse containing 80 poly bags of Cantaloupe plant with similar growth stage. The results obtained shows that, the proposed MPC-based irrigation system has higher water productivity index of 36.8 g/liters, good quality of fruit with average sweetness level of 13.5 Brix compared to automatic ETo-based irrigation system with 25.6 g/liters and 10.5 Brix, respectively. However, the total mass of harvested fruit for ETo-based irrigation system is higher than MPC-based irrigation system by 21.7%. The performance of the proposed MPC controller was achieved through the integration of event based scheduling with IoT monitoring as well as inclusion of evapotranspiration effect in the plant dynamics.

Introduction Water is one of the most precious resources on the earth, it is therefore imperative to measure, control and preserve for sustainable agricultural production and healthy living. The severe global competition for food and water is due to the effect of increase in world's population and climate change. This has increased the interest on how to achieve optimal use of scarce resources such as water using precision irrigation aimed at increasing food production and water saving [1]. The rate of water loss known as reference evapotranspiration (ETo) from plant and soil is dependant on the nonlinear dynamic change of soil, plant, and weather interaction. The regular change in evapotranspiration has effect in the available water in the soil for plant use, as a very high rate of ETo could lead to plant wilting. This remains a significant issue affecting the control strategies for crop irrigation, as there is a need for irrigation controller to adaptively adjust to the dynamic variations of soil, plant and weather parameters to ensure effective irrigation management [2]. Commonly, most farmers do not consider these dynamic varying factors when making irrigation scheduling decisions, which may lead to many draw backs such as low water use efficiency, reduced yield and more energy usage in driving pumps to supply of water for irrigation [3]. Consequently, the real time monitoring of weather, soil, and plant parameters within a cultivation environment using Internet of things (IoT) as well as wireless sensor networks (WSN) can enable the realization of smart management of different methods irrigation systems [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. There are various control strategies that can be used for irrigation management. The irrigation control strategies are basically categorized in open loop and close loop control methods. Irrigation decisions using open-loop control approach are managed based on the farmer intuition and using either on or off irrigation timers to control opening and closing of valves. The irrigation timing and volume is often specified and applied based on the farmers experience without considering sensors feedback on the changing parameters that has effect on plant such as soil moisture contents, and other weather parameters [11], [12], [13] The issues affecting with open-loop control of irrigation system affected by various environmental disturbances such as evapotranspiration, effect of different growth stage requirement of plants (Kc), and requires regular adjustment to ensure better performance [14]. The close loop control approach has been reported to be able to address the issue associated with open loop through the use of sensor based signal as feedback to keep the measured output condition close to the desired trajectory while deciding the duration of water supply to plants [14,15]. Research work on close loop control of irrigation have been implemented through simulation using the linear control approach such as proportional integral differential (PID) [16], [17], [18], [19], [20] and also linear quadratic regulator (LQR) [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26]. The works reported a good control performance through simulation, but their real time deployment on hardware was not thoroughly explored. Similarly, several works on intelligent control such as fuzzy logic and expert system approach where rules and formulated based on expert knowledge of the dynamics of the system was used to decide the timing and volume irrigation were carried out [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36]. This method has proven to be effective, but the drawback of this method is that no matter how well formulated the rules are, there will always be situations that don't exist in the rules. In most cases fuzzy based irrigation controllers are not often adaptive to the varying dynamics of plant, weather, and soil parameters. Also, reported in literatures is the use of artificial neural networks for soil moisture prediction [[37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46], [47], [48]] as well as metaheuristic algorithm for irrigation optimization [49], [50], [51], [52], [53], [54], [55]. The works were carried out as a good proof of concept through simulation, but the need for training of the ANN models on embedded hardware makes their real time implementation for irrigation of plant cultivation challenging, hence difficult to access their performance and suitability for farmers use. Also, the use of predictive models for irrigation scheduling has been reported in Refs. [56], [57], [58], [59]. The predictive models were used to predict the future trajectory of the control variable, while optimizing the cost function according to the reference trajectory. However, the work was only conducted through simulation only without experimental validation. In addition, the use of generalized predictive control (GPC) method for scheduling irrigation for tomato plant was reported to have achieved 20% water saving. However, the controller was not designed to handle constraint management on the control variables as well as the changing dynamics of the crop coefficient effect on ETo [60,61]. MPC is a model based algorithm that utilizes the model of a process to predict the future trajectory of the system controlled, by solving an online optimization at every time stamp to compute the future control action [62]. One of the issue reported in literature is on the applicability of MPC for process control application will provide a burden on producing high computational complexity associated with solving online optimization repeatedly on hardware [63]. Since the application of the MPC controller is in the area of precision irrigation agriculture has a slow process response, the integration of the concept of hourly event based triggering has been considered in this paper to decide the sampling instant at which the controller will solve online optimization to compute the optimal control action needed to minimize the error between the predicted moisture content of the soil and the set point trajectory can be used to address this issue. The summary of the comparison of the various related literatures to the proposed technique is illustrated in Table 1, where the proposed technique has more features considered in terms of monitored parameters, performance evaluation as well as implementation in both simulation and hardware.

Methodology MPC requires a good model that captures the dynamics of a process, to formulate an optimal control action that can drive the process through it reference trajectories. The process of model formulation for a drip irrigation system is based on the hydrological balance model as illustrated in Fig. 1, which has established that the change in soil moisture content during a period of time is as result of water inflow actions such as rainfall, irrigation as well as water outflows such as evapotranspiration, capillary rise, deep percolation and surface run off effect. The reference evapotranspiration also known as water loss from the process, is an important parameter of the model that depend on the weather variable, namely speed of wind, solar radiation, air temperature, air humidity, and the plant characteristic such as crop coefficient (Kc). Some measurable and estimated parameters of the hydrological process dynamics can be formulated into input and output data and use to fit an existing model structure through data driven modelling. The model that best fit to the data was further use for the MPC controller design needed for optimal water saving in a drip irrigation system.

The sequence of methodology that was adopted in the research is illustrated using Fig. 2. The setting of IoT framework for open loop experimental cultivation of Cantaloupe and Mustard leaf cultivation is designed to assist the data collection needed for the data driven modelling [70]. Thereafter, a data driven system identification was carried out based on the data collected in the open loop experiment. The developed model was used to design the proposed model predictive controller, and subsequent deployment of the proposed controller on Raspberry Pi 4 as a target hardware for cultivation experiment.

However, an improvement has been made as shown in Fig. 3 where an integration of model predictive controller has been designed in Raspberry Pi to control the pulse width modulated signal to drive the pump for supply of water through the drip irrigation network. Through the aid of a real-time IoT based weather station that senses weather parameters, an hourly computation of reference evapotranspiration (ETo) inferring the loss of water from soil surface and plant leafs is estimated based on Modified FAO-56 Penman–Monteith equation as shown in Eq. (1). The equation was developed in a customized IoT controller interfaced with the Davis weather station. Similarly, the real time computation of the crop coefficient (Kc) using image processing method which has effect on the rate of reference evapotranspiration (ETo) shown in Eq. (2) is also known as water loss which acts as disturbance to the process. (1) where, denotes the reference evapotranspiration (mm/hour); Rn represents the reference crop canopy net radiation (W/m2); Δ represents the slope of saturation vapour pressure (kPa °C-1); λ represent the latent heat of vaporization (kPa °C − 1); T represents the mean air temperature in Celsius; is the Mean daily or hourly wind speed at 2 m height (ms−1) and represent the stream pressure of saturation vapour (kPa) [71]. The estimated ETo is used to derive the actual evapotranspiration ( ), which is the loss of water from a specific crop, from where the estimated amount of water to replace the water loss is computed for further application to the plant, based on the crop coefficient ( ) which is of different value from one crop to another. (2) Based on the framework shown in Fig. 3, the real time sensing of soil moisture in terms of volumetric water content was carried out using a VH400 sensor connected to the IoT Expresso board. The VH400 sensor probe is a resistance based soil moisture content sensor which measures the dielectric constant of the soil when inserted vertically into the ground close to the root area of the plant [72]. The VH400 soil moisture sensor was calibrated using the piecewise linear equations as described in Eqs. (3)–(5). (3) (4) (5) where, is the slope of the line. The VH400’s voltage (v) to the curve can be approximated with 4 segments of the form in Eq. (3) and Eq. (4), respectively [73]. Similarly, and are the voltages recorded at the respective levels of and . The sensor has an inbuilt voltage regulator that operates with a DC input voltage of 3.5 to 20 Volts, which requires an input current of less than 7 mA. It produces a DC output voltage in the range of 0 to 3 which infers different level of the soil water content [74]. Similarly, the irrigation volume and reference evapotranspiration was computed using an IoT based flow metre and weather station. Similarly, the irrigation volume of the IoT based flowmeter produces an output digital pulse and then further counted by the IoT Expresso board to calculate the amount of water flow per each irrigation event. The water flowrate is calibrated using Eqs. (6) and (7). (6) where, the number of pulses generated per litre of water flowing through the sensor can be found in the water flow sensors specification datasheet, while is the number of pulse count generated by the flow sensor. The water flow volume can be calculated by summing up the product of flowrate and the time interval. (7) Water loss also known as disturbance of the process plant which requires an estimation of real time crop coefficient ( ) to guide an efficient water management [75]. To accurately estimate the water loss actual evapotranspiration (ETc) termed water loss requires real time monitoring of Kc at different growth stage as well as measurement of real time of reference evapotranspiration (ETo). Determining the height of the plant as well as the leaf area index using image processing to compute the can guide the accurate determination for the actual water loss and enable the model predictive controller to be able to compensate for the loss [75]. The computation of the was carried out using the ratio of LAI and plant height estimated based on Eq. (8) using and computed on Raspberry pi with camera. (8) 2.1. Data driven system identification of the system The data driven system identification of the process was carried out offline in MATLAB using the input and output data collected from a previous open loop experiment on similar plant. The experimental data collected was pre-processed and split into two, one for estimation and the other for validation. The data driven model is obtained using a system identification method, in which 3700 data point of input and output experimental dataset with sampling time of 10 min was used for the identification. Different time series model structures were selected to get a good model of the best fit, but the discrete-time state space model was chosen due to it suitability for controller design. The identified state space model is represented by Eqs. (9) and (10) with , , and matrices was used to represent the dynamics of the real system. Also, is the state variable at time instant , is the manipulated variable (irrigation flow), is the measured output (volumetric water content of the soil). (9) (10) where, 2.2. Model predictive control for drip irrigation system Model predictive control (MPC) is a process control algorithm that uses a model of a system to predict the future evolution of the system to optimize the control signal according to the cost function, while bringing the predictive output of the system to track the desired reference trajectory [76]. MPC requires a model that fully capture the varying dynamics of the plant to allow a good estimation of the future process while the controller takes decision based on the forecasting of the system's behaviour through optimization. The prediction horizon is the future number of samples to which the controller can predict the output of the plant, while the control horizon is the number of samples within the prediction horizon to which the controller have effect on the control signal. The MPC irrigation controller block diagram illustrated by Fig. 4 shows the irrigation system (plant) which is the cultivation environment with crop whose major monitoring and control parameter is the soil moisture, and often disturbed by high ETc, hence that requires the control action in terms of irrigation volume to compensate for the water loss in order to maintain the desired reference trajectory of the soil moisture content implied as the control variable. The MPC controller needs to predict the volume of irrigation in order to optimize some desired characteristics of the plant required at each sampling instance.

Model predictive control formulation Assuming that the soil moisture that is denoted as the state variable SM(t) is , i.e. , ,…, , where , is the state variable predicted at the sampling instant . The prediction horizon , denotes the number of future predicted samples. The objective of the MPC is to optimize the future control effort trajectory where is the control input or applied irrigation, is the control horizon that denotes the number of parameters that determines the future control trajectory. Note that , while denote the reference evapotranspiration which act as disturbance on the plant state variable. According to Ref. [77], in order to calculate the set of predicted state and output variables as a function of the future control variable using a state space model ( ) over a prediction horizon of as follows: (11) (12) (13) Similarly, the predicted output variables can be derived using the set of future control variables as follows (14) (15) (16) Therefore the future control moves and the future state variable are calculated from the augmented matrix and based on this the predicted output variable derived from Eqs. (9) to (16) and is given by Eq. (17). (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) and (22) (23) The cost function of the optimization is formulated in Eq. (24) as follows: (24) is the reference trajectory of the target soil moisture value, is the future value of the soil moisture content, is the function of the state and input variable. Where the vector of the references over is , is the current reference. is the weighting matrix of the tracking error while is the weighting matrix of the control increase. The tuning of and can enhance the error and control tracking performance of the MPC irrigation controller. The goal of the controller cost function to satisfy the dynamics of the system. That is to make the future output as close to the set point or reduce the error between the future output and the set point , ie reduce by generating the sequence of the appropriate control input action (k) in steady state where the change in control signal is eliminated. The formulation optimization problem for the MPC irrigation system design is to find the sequence of input that will minimize the cost function in Eq. (25). (25) Subject to the constraints that the initial state are measured at any time is known and measured and maintained between the field capacity of the soil ( ) and wilting point ( . The minimization also need to satisfy the system dynamics as well as the irrigation volume so as not to over irrigate the greenhouse to prevent over flooding with water and also maintain the soil moisture between the field capacity and wilting point. where, is the allowable optimal effective irrigation effort, are the wilting point and field capacity of the plant root zone deficit which serves as constraints to the irrigation system. The optimal control signal is obtained as follows in Eq. (26). (26) 2.4. Real time implementation of data driven MPC design in Simulink This section describe the application of MPC for designing a real time irrigation controller simulation via Simulink. The MPC controller block was designed with the state space model identified using the data driven modelling through system identification, and imported into the MPC designer app for configuration and tuning as described by algorithm 1 in Table 3, while flowchart guiding the controller is also illustrated using Fig. 8. The performance of the MPC also depends on the choice of the control and prediction horizon, and constraints on the control variable. The parameters used to design the predictive controller are, the prediction horizon of 5 and control horizon of 10 was chosen as seen in Table 2. One of the main strength is the ability to handle constraint on the plant. The constraint on the control variable (soil moisture) is set within the lower limit and upper limit called wilting point and field capacity respectively. Table 2.

The weight on the MV was used to penalise the control action, meaning that because the system is strongly nonlinear, with rapid variations of some variable with time, if the sampling interval is set too long, the process will be out of control for a long time simulation [59,78]. The input weights were chosen as close to zero (0.01), to provide more good control response. After the design, the controller is exported to the MATLAB workspace and saved as mat file. The MPC controller was exported and integrated with the event generator function in Simulink as shown in Fig. 5. In order to ensure optimal computational and controller performance and event based generator was integrated to update the controller based on a triggering event at one hour interval and when ETo is more than 1 mm/day for up to 10 min.

The hardware implementation for experimental cultivation validation The close loop simulation of the MPC controller design implemented in Simulink was deployed through of it support package for Raspberry Pi the hardware implementation realization as illustrated in Fig. 6. The model predictive irrigation algorithm generates the control action in form of pulse width modulated (PWM) signal a with a varying duty cycle to drive the manipulated variable while compensating for the loss and disturbance on the plant. The motor driver receives PWM control action signal from the GPIO pin 12 and 13 of the Raspberry Pi and provides the necessary driving current to the direct current (DC) water pump from the power supply. Raspberry-Pi 4 micro-computer was used to implement the model-based irrigation control system in real-time. The Raspberry pi uses a 1.5 GHz quad-core Broadcom processor, 64 bit SoC with 4 GB DDR4 of RAM, GPU 500 MHz video core vi. With this SoC specification, the model predictive control algorithm was able to run efficiently. The deployed MPC controller illustrated using the flowchart in Fig. 7 was used to adaptively control irrigation volume based on the rate of water loss for Cantaloupe plant cultivation in greenhouse 1 (GH1) from 10th September, 2020 and 29th October, 2020. Similarly, the automatic ET-based controller deployed in greenhouse 2 (GH2) was used to bench mark the performance of the proposed MPC controller.

The simulation result of the proposed MPC controller in Simulink is shown in Fig. 9. The graphs show the interaction plot of the soil moisture content, actual evapotranspiration, and irrigation flow against several sampling instant. The simulation results shows that the control variable, also the volumetric water content of the soil was brought to the set point of 0.35 m3/m3 even when the disturbance (water loss) in terms of actual evapotranspiration ETc is high, there is also corresponding control action to replace the water loss from the soil. The simulation result of the proposed MPC controller in Fig. 8 has similar trend with the bench marked works of [66,79], in terms of the control action denoted as irrigation volume, used to compensated for the water loss while regulating the soil moisture content within field capacity and wilting point. Similarly, the Fig. 10(a)–(c) further shows the relationship between the measured daily ETo, daily soil moisture content, and the daily hourly irrigation volume in (Liters) measured in MPC controlled GH1 respectively. The proposed controller was able to regulate the soil moisture content within the field capacity and wilting point, even when the rate of water loss in terms of ETo is high, while the pumped irrigation water was able to adaptively compensate the water loss (ETo).

The result of the performance evaluation is presented in Fig. 11, Fig. 12, Fig. 13. Different indices were used to determine the performance comparison of the two irrigation methods on the cultivated Cantaloupe plants, which are cumulative water consumption (litre), water use efficiency, weight of fruit (kg), and sweetness of fruit (brix). From the bar chart in Figs. 11 and 12 illustrates the performance comparison of the both controllers deployed in both greenhouse in terms of the mass of the harvested Cantaloupe fruit and the quality of the fruit.

Discussion Based on the comparison of the yield performance from the two greenhouses controlled by the MPC controller (GH1) and ETo based controller (GH2), the total mass of the harvested fruit in GH2 is higher than that of the GH1 as seen in Fig. 11. This could be as a result of the fact that a lot of water was consumed during the irrigation process in GH2, when compared to that of GH1. However the quality of fruits harvested in terms of sweetness was recorded in GH1 is observed to be better that the harvested fruits in GH2 as illustrated in Fig. 12. Therefore, the GH1 irrigated using the MPC has better fruit quality in terms of sweetness and improved water use efficiency. This could be due to the gradual increase of water supply to the plant root area based on the plant, soil and weather demand. Furthermore, the computation of the daily cumulative water use was carried out to be able to track the water saving capability of both controllers. From the graph of cumulative irrigation water use (Liters) shown in Fig. 13, it can be seen that irrigation water consumed by the automatic ETo controller is higher than that of the MPC controller. Similarly, about 2022 liters of water was saved in GH1 controlled by MPC. It can also be deduced from Fig. 13, the MPC controller in GH1 was able to achieve a 30.4% water saving when compared to automatic ETo based controller in GH2. This is due to the fact that MPC in GH1 was able to adaptive to the changing dynamics of the process as compared with the GH2 controller. (27) In addition, the performance of both controllers in GH2 and GH1, in terms of the water productivity index which relates the total mass on Cantaloupe produced with the total irrigation water use was further estimated using Eq. (27). According to Fig. 13, the total cumulative irrigation volume for GH2 and GH1 is 4467 and 2445 liters respectively, while total mass of equal samples of yield in GH2 and GH1 is 115.3 kg and 90 kg. Therefore, the water productivity index of GH1 is 36.8 kg/litres as against 25.6 kg/litres in GH2. It can be further deduced that the MPC controller in GH1 gives water productivity of 30.4% higher than the automatic ETo based controller in GH2, hence, highly suitable for water saving agriculture. The Fig. 14 illustrates the IoT based monitoring devices in GH1 and GH2 used to enable the deployment of both controllers for the experimental cultivation of the Cantaloupe plant.

Conclusion This paper presents the design and experimental implementation of data driven MPC for precision irrigation. The MPC controller was designed using a data driven identified state space model that captures the changing dynamics of the process, with the ability to adaptive control the irrigation volume required to compensate for the water loss within the greenhouse environment and also minimise the error between the measured soil moisture and the reference trajectory of the volumetric water content of the soil. The performance of the MPC controller deployed on Raspberry Pi 4 was put to test on the experimental cultivation of Cantaloupe plant using drip irrigation in GH1. The MPC irrigated greenhouse (GH1) recorded a good quality of fruit with average sweetness level of 13.5 Brix and higher water productivity index of 36.8 g/liters compared to automatic ETo based controller irrigated greenhouse (GH2) with 10.5 Brix and 25.6 g/liters respectively. However, the total mass of harvested fruit in GH2 is higher than that of GH1. From the performance comparison, both irrigation methods have their strength and weakness on Cantaloupe plant cultivation. Therefore, it is expected that this research effort will guide farmers to adopt an effective irrigation controller which comply with their cultivation objectives such as water saving, improve yield, and quality.

  Extract 1: Traditional irrigation control systems is characterized with inefficient management of water and often results in low water productivity index and reduced cultivation yield. In addition, insufficient water supply and high rate of water loss due to evapotranspiration increases plant stress which often affects its growth and development. Therefore, to address this issues, this paper is aimed at developing a model predictive control (MPC) strategy for water saving drip irrigation experiment that will regulate the soil moisture content within the desired field capacity and above the wilting point, while scheduling irrigation to replace the loss of water from soil and plant due to evapotranspiration in the greenhouse environment.
  Extract 2: The controller design involves a data driven predictive model identified and integrated with the MPC designer in MATLAB and thereafter exported in Simulink for simulation. The generate controller code was modified and deployed on a Raspberry Pi 4 controller to generate a pulse width modulated signal to drive the pump for the control water mixed with fertilizer. To achieve enhancement of controller an Internet of Things (IoT) integration was used for easy soil, weather, and plant monitoring which are used to update the MPC model for the irrigation control.
  Limitations: The paper's scope is limited to the development and evaluation of a specific MPC-based irrigation system for drip irrigation in a greenhouse environment.

The study primarily focuses on the technical implementation and performance evaluation of the proposed controller, with less emphasis on broader economic, environmental, or social aspects of automated irrigation systems.

The results and conclusions are specific to the experimental setup and conditions used in the study, and may not be directly applicable to different crop types, soil conditions, or climatic zones.
  Relevance Evaluation: The paper is highly relevant to the specific point mentioned in the review, as it proposes a feedback control system for implementing closed-loop irrigation management based on real-time data and advanced control techniques. The study investigates the use of proportional-integral-derivative (PID), model predictive control (MPC), and fuzzy logic control (FLC) to adjust irrigation schedules and optimize water usage. This research directly addresses the need for automated and data-driven irrigation systems that can enhance both water conservation and crop productivity.

The performance of the proposed MPC controller deployed drip irrigated Greenhouse(GH1) is benchmarked against an existing automatic evapotranspiration (ETo) model based controller in Greenhouse(GH2), with each greenhouse containing 80 poly bags of Cantaloupe plant with similar growth stage. The results obtained shows that, the proposed MPC-based irrigation system has higher water productivity index of 36.8 g/liters, good quality of fruit with average sweetness level of 13.5 Brix compared to automatic ETo-based irrigation system with 25.6 g/liters and 10.5 Brix, respectively. However, the total mass of harvested fruit for ETo-based irrigation system is higher than MPC-based irrigation system by 21.7%. The performance of the proposed MPC controller was achieved through the integration of event based scheduling with IoT monitoring as well as inclusion of evapotranspiration effect in the plant dynamics.

Introduction Water is one of the most precious resources on the earth, it is therefore imperative to measure, control and preserve for sustainable agricultural production and healthy living. The severe global competition for food and water is due to the effect of increase in world's population and climate change. This has increased the interest on how to achieve optimal use of scarce resources such as water using precision irrigation aimed at increasing food production and water saving [1]. The rate of water loss known as reference evapotranspiration (ETo) from plant and soil is dependant on the nonlinear dynamic change of soil, plant, and weather interaction. The regular change in evapotranspiration has effect in the available water in the soil for plant use, as a very high rate of ETo could lead to plant wilting. This remains a significant issue affecting the control strategies for crop irrigation, as there is a need for irrigation controller to adaptively adjust to the dynamic variations of soil, plant and weather parameters to ensure effective irrigation management [2]. Commonly, most farmers do not consider these dynamic varying factors when making irrigation scheduling decisions, which may lead to many draw backs such as low water use efficiency, reduced yield and more energy usage in driving pumps to supply of water for irrigation [3]. Consequently, the real time monitoring of weather, soil, and plant parameters within a cultivation environment using Internet of things (IoT) as well as wireless sensor networks (WSN) can enable the realization of smart management of different methods irrigation systems [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. There are various control strategies that can be used for irrigation management. The irrigation control strategies are basically categorized in open loop and close loop control methods. Irrigation decisions using open-loop control approach are managed based on the farmer intuition and using either on or off irrigation timers to control opening and closing of valves. The irrigation timing and volume is often specified and applied based on the farmers experience without considering sensors feedback on the changing parameters that has effect on plant such as soil moisture contents, and other weather parameters [11], [12], [13] The issues affecting with open-loop control of irrigation system affected by various environmental disturbances such as evapotranspiration, effect of different growth stage requirement of plants (Kc), and requires regular adjustment to ensure better performance [14]. The close loop control approach has been reported to be able to address the issue associated with open loop through the use of sensor based signal as feedback to keep the measured output condition close to the desired trajectory while deciding the duration of water supply to plants [14,15]. Research work on close loop control of irrigation have been implemented through simulation using the linear control approach such as proportional integral differential (PID) [16], [17], [18], [19], [20] and also linear quadratic regulator (LQR) [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26]. The works reported a good control performance through simulation, but their real time deployment on hardware was not thoroughly explored. Similarly, several works on intelligent control such as fuzzy logic and expert system approach where rules and formulated based on expert knowledge of the dynamics of the system was used to decide the timing and volume irrigation were carried out [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34], [35], [36]. This method has proven to be effective, but the drawback of this method is that no matter how well formulated the rules are, there will always be situations that don't exist in the rules. In most cases fuzzy based irrigation controllers are not often adaptive to the varying dynamics of plant, weather, and soil parameters. Also, reported in literatures is the use of artificial neural networks for soil moisture prediction [[37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46], [47], [48]] as well as metaheuristic algorithm for irrigation optimization [49], [50], [51], [52], [53], [54], [55]. The works were carried out as a good proof of concept through simulation, but the need for training of the ANN models on embedded hardware makes their real time implementation for irrigation of plant cultivation challenging, hence difficult to access their performance and suitability for farmers use. Also, the use of predictive models for irrigation scheduling has been reported in Refs. [56], [57], [58], [59]. The predictive models were used to predict the future trajectory of the control variable, while optimizing the cost function according to the reference trajectory. However, the work was only conducted through simulation only without experimental validation. In addition, the use of generalized predictive control (GPC) method for scheduling irrigation for tomato plant was reported to have achieved 20% water saving. However, the controller was not designed to handle constraint management on the control variables as well as the changing dynamics of the crop coefficient effect on ETo [60,61]. MPC is a model based algorithm that utilizes the model of a process to predict the future trajectory of the system controlled, by solving an online optimization at every time stamp to compute the future control action [62]. One of the issue reported in literature is on the applicability of MPC for process control application will provide a burden on producing high computational complexity associated with solving online optimization repeatedly on hardware [63]. Since the application of the MPC controller is in the area of precision irrigation agriculture has a slow process response, the integration of the concept of hourly event based triggering has been considered in this paper to decide the sampling instant at which the controller will solve online optimization to compute the optimal control action needed to minimize the error between the predicted moisture content of the soil and the set point trajectory can be used to address this issue. The summary of the comparison of the various related literatures to the proposed technique is illustrated in Table 1, where the proposed technique has more features considered in terms of monitored parameters, performance evaluation as well as implementation in both simulation and hardware.

Methodology MPC requires a good model that captures the dynamics of a process, to formulate an optimal control action that can drive the process through it reference trajectories. The process of model formulation for a drip irrigation system is based on the hydrological balance model as illustrated in Fig. 1, which has established that the change in soil moisture content during a period of time is as result of water inflow actions such as rainfall, irrigation as well as water outflows such as evapotranspiration, capillary rise, deep percolation and surface run off effect. The reference evapotranspiration also known as water loss from the process, is an important parameter of the model that depend on the weather variable, namely speed of wind, solar radiation, air temperature, air humidity, and the plant characteristic such as crop coefficient (Kc). Some measurable and estimated parameters of the hydrological process dynamics can be formulated into input and output data and use to fit an existing model structure through data driven modelling. The model that best fit to the data was further use for the MPC controller design needed for optimal water saving in a drip irrigation system.

However, an improvement has been made as shown in Fig. 3 where an integration of model predictive controller has been designed in Raspberry Pi to control the pulse width modulated signal to drive the pump for supply of water through the drip irrigation network. Through the aid of a real-time IoT based weather station that senses weather parameters, an hourly computation of reference evapotranspiration (ETo) inferring the loss of water from soil surface and plant leafs is estimated based on Modified FAO-56 Penman–Monteith equation as shown in Eq. (1). The equation was developed in a customized IoT controller interfaced with the Davis weather station. Similarly, the real time computation of the crop coefficient (Kc) using image processing method which has effect on the rate of reference evapotranspiration (ETo) shown in Eq. (2) is also known as water loss which acts as disturbance to the process. (1) where, denotes the reference evapotranspiration (mm/hour); Rn represents the reference crop canopy net radiation (W/m2); Δ represents the slope of saturation vapour pressure (kPa °C-1); λ represent the latent heat of vaporization (kPa °C − 1); T represents the mean air temperature in Celsius; is the Mean daily or hourly wind speed at 2 m height (ms−1) and represent the stream pressure of saturation vapour (kPa) [71]. The estimated ETo is used to derive the actual evapotranspiration ( ), which is the loss of water from a specific crop, from where the estimated amount of water to replace the water loss is computed for further application to the plant, based on the crop coefficient ( ) which is of different value from one crop to another. (2) Based on the framework shown in Fig. 3, the real time sensing of soil moisture in terms of volumetric water content was carried out using a VH400 sensor connected to the IoT Expresso board. The VH400 sensor probe is a resistance based soil moisture content sensor which measures the dielectric constant of the soil when inserted vertically into the ground close to the root area of the plant [72]. The VH400 soil moisture sensor was calibrated using the piecewise linear equations as described in Eqs. (3)–(5). (3) (4) (5) where, is the slope of the line. The VH400’s voltage (v) to the curve can be approximated with 4 segments of the form in Eq. (3) and Eq. (4), respectively [73]. Similarly, and are the voltages recorded at the respective levels of and . The sensor has an inbuilt voltage regulator that operates with a DC input voltage of 3.5 to 20 Volts, which requires an input current of less than 7 mA. It produces a DC output voltage in the range of 0 to 3 which infers different level of the soil water content [74]. Similarly, the irrigation volume and reference evapotranspiration was computed using an IoT based flow metre and weather station. Similarly, the irrigation volume of the IoT based flowmeter produces an output digital pulse and then further counted by the IoT Expresso board to calculate the amount of water flow per each irrigation event. The water flowrate is calibrated using Eqs. (6) and (7). (6) where, the number of pulses generated per litre of water flowing through the sensor can be found in the water flow sensors specification datasheet, while is the number of pulse count generated by the flow sensor. The water flow volume can be calculated by summing up the product of flowrate and the time interval. (7) Water loss also known as disturbance of the process plant which requires an estimation of real time crop coefficient ( ) to guide an efficient water management [75]. To accurately estimate the water loss actual evapotranspiration (ETc) termed water loss requires real time monitoring of Kc at different growth stage as well as measurement of real time of reference evapotranspiration (ETo). Determining the height of the plant as well as the leaf area index using image processing to compute the can guide the accurate determination for the actual water loss and enable the model predictive controller to be able to compensate for the loss [75]. The computation of the was carried out using the ratio of LAI and plant height estimated based on Eq. (8) using and computed on Raspberry pi with camera. (8) 2.1. Data driven system identification of the system The data driven system identification of the process was carried out offline in MATLAB using the input and output data collected from a previous open loop experiment on similar plant. The experimental data collected was pre-processed and split into two, one for estimation and the other for validation. The data driven model is obtained using a system identification method, in which 3700 data point of input and output experimental dataset with sampling time of 10 min was used for the identification. Different time series model structures were selected to get a good model of the best fit, but the discrete-time state space model was chosen due to it suitability for controller design. The identified state space model is represented by Eqs. (9) and (10) with , , and matrices was used to represent the dynamics of the real system. Also, is the state variable at time instant , is the manipulated variable (irrigation flow), is the measured output (volumetric water content of the soil). (9) (10) where, 2.2. Model predictive control for drip irrigation system Model predictive control (MPC) is a process control algorithm that uses a model of a system to predict the future evolution of the system to optimize the control signal according to the cost function, while bringing the predictive output of the system to track the desired reference trajectory [76]. MPC requires a model that fully capture the varying dynamics of the plant to allow a good estimation of the future process while the controller takes decision based on the forecasting of the system's behaviour through optimization. The prediction horizon is the future number of samples to which the controller can predict the output of the plant, while the control horizon is the number of samples within the prediction horizon to which the controller have effect on the control signal. The MPC irrigation controller block diagram illustrated by Fig. 4 shows the irrigation system (plant) which is the cultivation environment with crop whose major monitoring and control parameter is the soil moisture, and often disturbed by high ETc, hence that requires the control action in terms of irrigation volume to compensate for the water loss in order to maintain the desired reference trajectory of the soil moisture content implied as the control variable. The MPC controller needs to predict the volume of irrigation in order to optimize some desired characteristics of the plant required at each sampling instance.

Model predictive control formulation Assuming that the soil moisture that is denoted as the state variable SM(t) is , i.e. , ,…, , where , is the state variable predicted at the sampling instant . The prediction horizon , denotes the number of future predicted samples. The objective of the MPC is to optimize the future control effort trajectory where is the control input or applied irrigation, is the control horizon that denotes the number of parameters that determines the future control trajectory. Note that , while denote the reference evapotranspiration which act as disturbance on the plant state variable. According to Ref. [77], in order to calculate the set of predicted state and output variables as a function of the future control variable using a state space model ( ) over a prediction horizon of as follows: (11) (12) (13) Similarly, the predicted output variables can be derived using the set of future control variables as follows (14) (15) (16) Therefore the future control moves and the future state variable are calculated from the augmented matrix and based on this the predicted output variable derived from Eqs. (9) to (16) and is given by Eq. (17). (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) and (22) (23) The cost function of the optimization is formulated in Eq. (24) as follows: (24) is the reference trajectory of the target soil moisture value, is the future value of the soil moisture content, is the function of the state and input variable. Where the vector of the references over is , is the current reference. is the weighting matrix of the tracking error while is the weighting matrix of the control increase. The tuning of and can enhance the error and control tracking performance of the MPC irrigation controller. The goal of the controller cost function to satisfy the dynamics of the system. That is to make the future output as close to the set point or reduce the error between the future output and the set point , ie reduce by generating the sequence of the appropriate control input action (k) in steady state where the change in control signal is eliminated. The formulation optimization problem for the MPC irrigation system design is to find the sequence of input that will minimize the cost function in Eq. (25). (25) Subject to the constraints that the initial state are measured at any time is known and measured and maintained between the field capacity of the soil ( ) and wilting point ( . The minimization also need to satisfy the system dynamics as well as the irrigation volume so as not to over irrigate the greenhouse to prevent over flooding with water and also maintain the soil moisture between the field capacity and wilting point. where, is the allowable optimal effective irrigation effort, are the wilting point and field capacity of the plant root zone deficit which serves as constraints to the irrigation system. The optimal control signal is obtained as follows in Eq. (26). (26) 2.4. Real time implementation of data driven MPC design in Simulink This section describe the application of MPC for designing a real time irrigation controller simulation via Simulink. The MPC controller block was designed with the state space model identified using the data driven modelling through system identification, and imported into the MPC designer app for configuration and tuning as described by algorithm 1 in Table 3, while flowchart guiding the controller is also illustrated using Fig. 8. The performance of the MPC also depends on the choice of the control and prediction horizon, and constraints on the control variable. The parameters used to design the predictive controller are, the prediction horizon of 5 and control horizon of 10 was chosen as seen in Table 2. One of the main strength is the ability to handle constraint on the plant. The constraint on the control variable (soil moisture) is set within the lower limit and upper limit called wilting point and field capacity respectively. Table 2.

The weight on the MV was used to penalise the control action, meaning that because the system is strongly nonlinear, with rapid variations of some variable with time, if the sampling interval is set too long, the process will be out of control for a long time simulation [59,78]. The input weights were chosen as close to zero (0.01), to provide more good control response. After the design, the controller is exported to the MATLAB workspace and saved as mat file. The MPC controller was exported and integrated with the event generator function in Simulink as shown in Fig. 5. In order to ensure optimal computational and controller performance and event based generator was integrated to update the controller based on a triggering event at one hour interval and when ETo is more than 1 mm/day for up to 10 min.

The hardware implementation for experimental cultivation validation The close loop simulation of the MPC controller design implemented in Simulink was deployed through of it support package for Raspberry Pi the hardware implementation realization as illustrated in Fig. 6. The model predictive irrigation algorithm generates the control action in form of pulse width modulated (PWM) signal a with a varying duty cycle to drive the manipulated variable while compensating for the loss and disturbance on the plant. The motor driver receives PWM control action signal from the GPIO pin 12 and 13 of the Raspberry Pi and provides the necessary driving current to the direct current (DC) water pump from the power supply. Raspberry-Pi 4 micro-computer was used to implement the model-based irrigation control system in real-time. The Raspberry pi uses a 1.5 GHz quad-core Broadcom processor, 64 bit SoC with 4 GB DDR4 of RAM, GPU 500 MHz video core vi. With this SoC specification, the model predictive control algorithm was able to run efficiently. The deployed MPC controller illustrated using the flowchart in Fig. 7 was used to adaptively control irrigation volume based on the rate of water loss for Cantaloupe plant cultivation in greenhouse 1 (GH1) from 10th September, 2020 and 29th October, 2020. Similarly, the automatic ET-based controller deployed in greenhouse 2 (GH2) was used to bench mark the performance of the proposed MPC controller.

The simulation result of the proposed MPC controller in Simulink is shown in Fig. 9. The graphs show the interaction plot of the soil moisture content, actual evapotranspiration, and irrigation flow against several sampling instant. The simulation results shows that the control variable, also the volumetric water content of the soil was brought to the set point of 0.35 m3/m3 even when the disturbance (water loss) in terms of actual evapotranspiration ETc is high, there is also corresponding control action to replace the water loss from the soil. The simulation result of the proposed MPC controller in Fig. 8 has similar trend with the bench marked works of [66,79], in terms of the control action denoted as irrigation volume, used to compensated for the water loss while regulating the soil moisture content within field capacity and wilting point. Similarly, the Fig. 10(a)–(c) further shows the relationship between the measured daily ETo, daily soil moisture content, and the daily hourly irrigation volume in (Liters) measured in MPC controlled GH1 respectively. The proposed controller was able to regulate the soil moisture content within the field capacity and wilting point, even when the rate of water loss in terms of ETo is high, while the pumped irrigation water was able to adaptively compensate the water loss (ETo).

The result of the performance evaluation is presented in Fig. 11, Fig. 12, Fig. 13. Different indices were used to determine the performance comparison of the two irrigation methods on the cultivated Cantaloupe plants, which are cumulative water consumption (litre), water use efficiency, weight of fruit (kg), and sweetness of fruit (brix). From the bar chart in Figs. 11 and 12 illustrates the performance comparison of the both controllers deployed in both greenhouse in terms of the mass of the harvested Cantaloupe fruit and the quality of the fruit.

Discussion Based on the comparison of the yield performance from the two greenhouses controlled by the MPC controller (GH1) and ETo based controller (GH2), the total mass of the harvested fruit in GH2 is higher than that of the GH1 as seen in Fig. 11. This could be as a result of the fact that a lot of water was consumed during the irrigation process in GH2, when compared to that of GH1. However the quality of fruits harvested in terms of sweetness was recorded in GH1 is observed to be better that the harvested fruits in GH2 as illustrated in Fig. 12. Therefore, the GH1 irrigated using the MPC has better fruit quality in terms of sweetness and improved water use efficiency. This could be due to the gradual increase of water supply to the plant root area based on the plant, soil and weather demand. Furthermore, the computation of the daily cumulative water use was carried out to be able to track the water saving capability of both controllers. From the graph of cumulative irrigation water use (Liters) shown in Fig. 13, it can be seen that irrigation water consumed by the automatic ETo controller is higher than that of the MPC controller. Similarly, about 2022 liters of water was saved in GH1 controlled by MPC. It can also be deduced from Fig. 13, the MPC controller in GH1 was able to achieve a 30.4% water saving when compared to automatic ETo based controller in GH2. This is due to the fact that MPC in GH1 was able to adaptive to the changing dynamics of the process as compared with the GH2 controller. (27) In addition, the performance of both controllers in GH2 and GH1, in terms of the water productivity index which relates the total mass on Cantaloupe produced with the total irrigation water use was further estimated using Eq. (27). According to Fig. 13, the total cumulative irrigation volume for GH2 and GH1 is 4467 and 2445 liters respectively, while total mass of equal samples of yield in GH2 and GH1 is 115.3 kg and 90 kg. Therefore, the water productivity index of GH1 is 36.8 kg/litres as against 25.6 kg/litres in GH2. It can be further deduced that the MPC controller in GH1 gives water productivity of 30.4% higher than the automatic ETo based controller in GH2, hence, highly suitable for water saving agriculture. The Fig. 14 illustrates the IoT based monitoring devices in GH1 and GH2 used to enable the deployment of both controllers for the experimental cultivation of the Cantaloupe plant.

Conclusion This paper presents the design and experimental implementation of data driven MPC for precision irrigation. The MPC controller was designed using a data driven identified state space model that captures the changing dynamics of the process, with the ability to adaptive control the irrigation volume required to compensate for the water loss within the greenhouse environment and also minimise the error between the measured soil moisture and the reference trajectory of the volumetric water content of the soil. The performance of the MPC controller deployed on Raspberry Pi 4 was put to test on the experimental cultivation of Cantaloupe plant using drip irrigation in GH1. The MPC irrigated greenhouse (GH1) recorded a good quality of fruit with average sweetness level of 13.5 Brix and higher water productivity index of 36.8 g/liters compared to automatic ETo based controller irrigated greenhouse (GH2) with 10.5 Brix and 25.6 g/liters respectively. However, the total mass of harvested fruit in GH2 is higher than that of GH1. From the performance comparison, both irrigation methods have their strength and weakness on Cantaloupe plant cultivation. Therefore, it is expected that this research effort will guide farmers to adopt an effective irrigation controller which comply with their cultivation objectives such as water saving, improve yield, and quality.

A systematic review of automated systems for real-time irrigation management

1. INTRODUCTION
The challenge of feeding a growing population with finite resources is becoming increasingly pressing. By 2050, the world population is expected to reach 9.7 billion, necessitating a 70% increase in food production (Falkenmark and Rockstrom, 2009). Irrigation plays a crucial role in enhancing crop yields and agricultural productivity to meet this growing demand. Studies have shown that irrigation can significantly increase crop water productivity, contributing to increased food production (Ali and Talukder, 2008; Playan and Mateos, 2005). However, water scarcity poses a significant challenge, with many regions facing water deficits and the need for improved water management practices (Falkenmark and Rockstrom, 2009). Optimizing irrigation schedules and doses based on crop requirements and environmental conditions is essential for maximizing yield and quality while minimizing water use (Zhang et al., 2024). The necessity of scalable water-efficient practices for increasing food demand cannot be overstated. Techniques such as regulated deficit irrigation, magnetically treated water, and the use of drought-tolerant crops like sorghum have shown promise in improving water productivity and ensuring food security (Mehmood et al., 2023; Putti et al., 2023; Hadebe et al., 2016). As the global food challenge intensifies, it is imperative to critically evaluate the current state and future potential of irrigation management systems to guide research, innovation, and implementation efforts towards fully autonomous, scalable solutions.

Despite the importance of irrigation in addressing the global food challenge, traditional irrigation management techniques, such as manual scheduling and timer-based systems, have significant limitations. These methods are often labor-intensive, inefficient, and less adaptable to changing conditions (Savin et al., 2023). Manual and timer-based scheduling can lead to high operational costs and inefficient water use (Raghavendra, Han, and Shin, 2023). The reliance on manual intervention and predetermined schedules limits their adaptability to changing environmental conditions, crop water requirements, and soil moisture levels (Kaptein et al., 2019). Sensor-based irrigation systems offer an alternative, enabling real-time adjustments based on soil water status measurements (Kaptein et al., 2019). However, the adoption of these systems in commercial settings has been limited, often requiring extensive input from researchers (Kim et al., 2014; Lea-Cox et al., 2018; Ristvey et al., 2018). The limitations of traditional irrigation management techniques highlight the need for scalable, automated solutions for greater efficiency in irrigation management. Automated systems that collect real-time data, analyze it, and make autonomous irrigation decisions can lead to improved water use efficiency and increased crop productivity (Champness et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2022). To fully understand the potential of automated systems, it is necessary to examine the automation of each part of the irrigation management pipeline and analyze the effectiveness and efficiency of integrated end-to-end solutions.

The emergence of smart irrigation management and IoT marks a significant shift from historical irrigation practices. Modern approaches rely on vast data and analysis algorithms, leveraging technologies such as remote sensing, sensor networks, weather data, and computational algorithms (Atanasov, 2023; Bellvert et al., 2023; Kumar et al., 2023). IoT plays a vital role in collecting vast amounts of data through sensors, data transmission, and tailored networks, enabling real-time monitoring and control of irrigation systems (Liakos, 2023; Zuckerman et al., 2024). These advancements in data collection and analysis have the potential to revolutionize irrigation management, allowing for more precise and efficient water use. However, challenges such as processing diverse data sources, data integration, and lack of integrated data analysis hamper the full benefit of IoT in irrigation management (Dave et al., 2023). The current fragmented approach in smart irrigation, focusing on individual components rather than the entire system, limits the potential for fully autonomous, real-time end-to-end irrigation management (Togneri et al., 2021). To address these challenges and fully realize the potential of smart irrigation management, there is a need for automating and integrating each section of the irrigation management pipeline, from sensor/weather data collection and transmission to processing, analysis, decision-making, and automated action (McKinion and Lemmon, 1985). This integration requires a thorough investigation of the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling seamless communication and compatibility between components within the automated irrigation management pipeline.

Machine learning (ML) plays a significant role in processing vast data, predicting plant stress, modeling climate effects, and optimizing irrigation in smart irrigation management systems. ML algorithms can analyze data collected from sensors and weather stations to determine optimal irrigation schedules (Vianny et al., 2022). However, the potential of ML is often constrained by manual steps, such as data interpretation, decision-making on irrigation timing and volume, and system adjustments. Automating ML integration to allow direct action from insights to irrigation execution, removing bottlenecks and achieving real-time adaptability, is crucial for fully autonomous irrigation management (Barzallo-Bertot et al., 2022). By integrating ML into automated systems, the irrigation management pipeline can become more seamless and efficient, enabling real-time decision-making and action based on data-driven insights. To achieve this level of automation and integration, it is essential to identify gaps and propose solutions for seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, aiming to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.

To achieve seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, interoperability and standardization are critical. Interoperability allows different system components, such as sensors, actuators, and software, to communicate and exchange data effectively, while standardization ensures that data is represented in a consistent format (Santos et al., 2020). Standardized protocols and data formats are essential for achieving seamless integration and ensuring compatibility between components in real-time irrigation management systems (Robles et al., 2022; Hatzivasilis et al., 2018). Existing and emerging standards, such as OGC SensorThings API and ISO 11783, have applicability to real-time irrigation management systems (Hazra et al., 2021). However, challenges such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security need to be addressed to fully realize the potential of interoperability and standardization in automated irrigation management systems (Hazra et al., 2021). Addressing these challenges is crucial for enabling the seamless integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline, which is essential for achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. A comprehensive evaluation of the role of interoperability and standardization in enabling the integration of components within the automated irrigation management pipeline is necessary to guide future research and implementation efforts.
The primary objective of this systematic review is to critically evaluate the current state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies for enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
Specific objectives include:
•	Examining the automation of each part of the irrigation management pipeline and the seamless integration of each section in the context of irrigation scheduling and management.
•	Analyzing the effectiveness and efficiency of integrated end-to-end automated irrigation systems.

•	Identifying gaps and proposing solutions for seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system, aiming to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.
By addressing these objectives, this systematic review aims to provide a comprehensive and critical evaluation of the current state and future potential of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems. Its intention is to guide future research, innovation, and implementation efforts to achieve fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management that can contribute to addressing the global food challenge.

3. DATA COLLECTION TO CLOUD: AUTOMATION AND REAL-TIME PROCESSING
3.1. Irrigation management data
The success of automated irrigation management systems relies heavily on the collection, transmission, and analysis of various types of data. The most applicable data types for irrigation management include soil moisture, canopy temperature, weather data, and plant physiological parameters (Farooq et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019; Olivier et al., 2021; Evett et al., 2020). These data are typically collected from a range of sources, including in-field sensors, remote sensing platforms, weather stations, and manual measurements (Li et al., 2019; Karimi et al., 2018).
Soil moisture data is arguably the most critical type of data for irrigation management, as it directly reflects the water available to plants and can be used to determine the optimal timing and amount of irrigation (Olivier et al., 2021; Intrigliolo & Castel, 2006). Soil moisture sensors, such as tensiometers, capacitance probes, and time-domain reflectometry (TDR) sensors, can provide real-time measurements of soil water content at various depths (Farooq et al., 2019). These sensors can be deployed in a network configuration to capture spatial variability in soil moisture across a field (Karimi et al., 2018).
Canopy temperature data is another valuable type of data for irrigation management, as it can be used to assess plant water stress and adjust irrigation accordingly (Evett et al., 2020). Infrared thermometers and thermal cameras can be used to measure canopy temperature, which is influenced by factors such as air temperature, humidity, wind speed, and plant water status (Li et al., 2019). When plants experience water stress, they tend to close their stomata to reduce water loss, leading to an increase in canopy temperature (Evett et al., 2020). By monitoring canopy temperature and comparing it to reference values, automated irrigation systems can detect plant water stress and trigger irrigation events to maintain optimal plant health and productivity (Li et al., 2019).
Weather data, including temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, and solar radiation, are essential for predicting crop water requirements and scheduling irrigation events (Akilan & Baalamurugan, 2024). Weather stations equipped with various sensors can provide real-time measurements of these parameters, which can be used as inputs for crop water requirement models, such as the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith equation (Li et al., 2019). These models estimate crop evapotranspiration (ET) based on weather data and crop-specific coefficients, allowing for the calculation of irrigation requirements (Intrigliolo & Castel, 2006). By integrating weather data into automated irrigation systems, irrigation schedules can be dynamically adjusted based on changing environmental conditions, ensuring that crops receive the optimal amount of water at the right time (Akilan & Baalamurugan, 2024).
When collecting and utilizing these data types, several considerations must be taken into account, including the volume, frequency, format, and source of the data (Farooq et al., 2019). The volume of data generated by automated irrigation systems can be substantial, especially when high-resolution sensors are deployed at a large scale (Bastidas Pacheco et al., 2022). This necessitates the use of efficient data storage, processing, and transmission technologies to handle the data load (Farooq et al., 2019). The frequency of data collection is another important consideration, as it directly impacts the temporal resolution of the data and the ability to detect rapid changes in plant water status or environmental conditions (Bastidas Pacheco et al., 2022). Bastidas Pacheco et al. (2022) demonstrated that collecting full pulse resolution data from water meters provides more accurate estimates of event occurrence, timing, and features compared to aggregated temporal resolutions, highlighting the importance of selecting appropriate data collection frequencies to ensure the quality and usefulness of the data for irrigation management.
The format of the data is also crucial, as it determines the compatibility and interoperability of the data with various analysis tools and platforms (Farooq et al., 2019). Standardized data formats, such as JSON, XML, or CSV, can facilitate data exchange and integration between different components of the automated irrigation system (Zhang et al., 2023). The source of the data is another important consideration, as it can impact the reliability, accuracy, and spatial coverage of the data (Farooq et al., 2019). For example, in-field sensors provide highly localized measurements, while remote sensing platforms, such as satellites or drones, can provide data at larger spatial scales (Li et al., 2019). By combining data from multiple sources, automated irrigation systems can achieve a more comprehensive understanding of crop water requirements and optimize irrigation management accordingly (Farooq et al., 2019).
Data quality, accuracy, and reliability are paramount in irrigation management, as they directly impact the effectiveness of decision-making processes and the efficiency of water use (Gupta et al., 2020). Inaccurate or unreliable data can lead to suboptimal irrigation decisions, resulting in crop stress, yield losses, or wasted water resources (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022). Gupta et al. (2020) emphasized the critical importance of data security and privacy in smart farming systems, as the leakage of sensitive agricultural data can cause severe economic losses to farmers and compromise the integrity of the automated irrigation system. The authors also highlighted the need for robust authentication and secure communication protocols to prevent unauthorized access to smart farming systems and protect data in transit (Gupta et al., 2020).
Ramli and Jabbar (2022) addressed the challenges associated with implementing real-time, automated irrigation systems, including data quality, scalability, reliability, and security. They proposed solutions and best practices based on the analysis of case studies and real-world implementations, such as the use of redundant sensors, data validation techniques, and secure communication protocols (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022). The authors also emphasized the importance of regular maintenance and calibration of sensors to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the collected data (Ramli & Jabbar, 2022).
Researchers have investigated the use of data compression, aggregation, and filtering techniques to reduce bandwidth requirements and improve transmission efficiency in automated irrigation systems (Karim et al., 2023; Rady et al., 2020; Cui, 2023). Karim et al. (2023) explored the effectiveness of various data compression techniques, such as lossless and lossy compression algorithms, in reducing the size of data packets transmitted over wireless networks. The authors found that lossless compression techniques, such as Huffman coding and Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW), can significantly reduce data size without compromising data quality, while lossy compression techniques, such as JPEG and MP3, can further reduce data size by introducing acceptable levels of distortion (Karim et al., 2023).
Rady et al. (2020) developed a novel data compression algorithm specifically designed for irrigation data, which achieved significant compression ratios without compromising data quality. The authors demonstrated that their algorithm could reduce the amount of data transmitted over wireless networks, thereby improving the efficiency of the irrigation system and reducing costs (Rady et al., 2020). Cui (2023) investigated the use of data aggregation and filtering techniques to reduce the number of transmissions and save bandwidth in automated irrigation systems. The author proposed a data aggregation scheme that combines multiple sensor readings into a single value, such as the average soil moisture over a specified time interval, to reduce the frequency of data transmissions (Cui, 2023). Additionally, the author explored the use of data filtering techniques, such as Kalman filters and particle filters, to remove noise and outliers from sensor data, improving the accuracy and reliability of the transmitted information (Cui, 2023).
Data standardization and harmonization are crucial for facilitating seamless integration and interoperability between the various components of automated irrigation management systems (Zhang et al., 2023; Ermoliev et al., 2022). Zhang et al. (2023) developed a novel cyberinformatics technology called iCrop, which enables the in-season monitoring of crop-specific land cover across the contiguous United States. The authors highlighted the importance of data standardization and harmonization in the context of iCrop, as it allows for the efficient distribution of crop-specific land cover information based on the findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) data principle (Zhang et al., 2023). By adopting standardized data formats and protocols, such as the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards, iCrop enables the seamless integration of various data sources and facilitates the interoperability of the system with other agricultural decision support tools (Zhang et al., 2023).
Ermoliev et al. (2022) proposed a linkage methodology for linking distributed sectoral/regional optimization models in a situation where private information is not available or cannot be shared by modeling teams. The authors emphasized the need for data standardization to enable decentralized cross-sectoral coordination and analysis, as it allows for the consistent representation and exchange of data between different models and stakeholders (Ermoliev et al., 2022). By adopting standardized data formats and interfaces, the proposed linkage methodology can facilitate the integration of various optimization models and support the development of comprehensive decision support systems for sustainable resource management (Ermoliev et al., 2022).
Metadata plays a vital role in providing context and enabling better data interpretation and decision-making in automated irrigation management systems (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021). Metadata refers to the additional information that describes the characteristics, quality, and context of the primary data, such as the sensor type, calibration parameters, measurement units, and timestamp (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021). Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al. (2021) highlighted the importance of metadata in water resources management, as it enables decision-makers to use the data to the best of its capabilities by understanding factors such as when water data was collected and what factors might have contributed to the measurements. The authors emphasized the need for standardized metadata formats and guidelines, such as the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative (DCMI) and the ISO 19115 standard, to ensure the consistency and interoperability of metadata across different water information systems (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021).
In the context of automated irrigation management systems, metadata can provide valuable information about the data collection process, sensor performance, and environmental conditions that can aid in data interpretation and decision-making (Cota & Mamede, 2023). For example, metadata about the sensor type and calibration parameters can help assess the accuracy and reliability of the collected data, while metadata about the weather conditions and soil properties can provide context for interpreting the data and adjusting irrigation strategies accordingly (Cota & Mamede, 2023). By incorporating metadata into the data management and analysis pipeline of automated irrigation systems, decision-makers can make more informed and context-aware decisions, leading to improved water use efficiency and crop productivity (Jahanddideh-Tehrani et al., 2021).

3.2. Edge Computing and Fog Computing
Edge computing and fog computing have emerged as transformative technologies in the realm of real-time irrigation management systems, offering significant potential for improving efficiency, scalability, and reliability (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2019). Edge computing refers to the practice of processing data near the edge of the network, close to the source of the data, while fog computing is a decentralized computing infrastructure that extends cloud computing capabilities to the network edge (Hassija et al., 2019). These technologies bring computation and analytics closer to the data source, reducing the need for data to travel to the cloud and enabling faster processing and decision-making (Hassija et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020).
The potential of edge computing and fog computing in real-time irrigation management is immense. Abdel Nasser et al. (2020) proposed a two-layer system for water demand prediction using automated meters and machine learning techniques, demonstrating the potential of edge computing in improving the efficiency and scalability of irrigation management. The system collects and aggregates data from distributed smart meters in the first layer, while the second layer uses LSTM neural networks to predict water demand for different regions of households. By leveraging edge computing, the system can achieve high accuracy in predicting water demand, which is essential for efficient irrigation management (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020).
Tran et al. (2019) conducted a comprehensive review of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems, highlighting the role of fog computing in addressing data transmission challenges and enabling seamless integration across the irrigation management pipeline. The authors emphasize that real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems have the potential to significantly improve water efficiency, crop yields, and reduce labor costs. However, they also identify several challenges that need to be addressed, such as data quality, scalability, reliability, and security, which can be effectively tackled by implementing fog computing architectures (Tran et al., 2019).
Edge computing offers several benefits in real-time irrigation management systems, including reduced latency, real-time decision-making, and reduced reliance on cloud connectivity (Mishra, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020). By processing data closer to the source, edge computing enables faster response times and more efficient data handling (Mishra, 2020). Mishra (2020) highlights that edge computing reduces latency by processing data closer to the source, enabling real-time decision-making and lessening reliance on cloud connectivity by shifting processing to local or edge devices.
Zhang et al. (2020) explore the application of edge computing in agricultural settings, demonstrating its potential to improve the efficiency and accuracy of irrigation systems. The authors discuss how edge computing has prospects in various agricultural applications, such as pest identification, safety traceability of agricultural products, unmanned agricultural machinery, agricultural technology promotion, and intelligent management. They also emphasize that the emergence of edge computing models, such as fog computing, cloudlet, and mobile edge computing, has transformed the management and operation of farms (Zhang et al., 2020).
Fog computing plays a crucial role in distributing processing and storage across the network, enhancing the scalability and reliability of automated irrigation systems (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022; Singh et al., 2022). Premkumar and Sigappi (2022) evaluate the current state of automated irrigation management systems and propose a hybrid machine learning approach for predicting soil moisture and managing irrigation. Their study emphasizes the potential of fog computing in distributing processing and storage across the network, improving the efficiency and scalability of irrigation systems. The proposed hybrid machine learning approach outperforms other machine learning algorithms in predicting soil moisture, demonstrating the effectiveness of fog computing in enhancing the performance of automated irrigation systems (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022).
Singh et al. (2022) discuss the role of fog computing in distributing processing and storage across the network, enhancing scalability and reliability in agricultural management systems. The authors argue that by implementing fog computing, these systems can achieve faster data processing and response times, improving overall efficiency and effectiveness. They also highlight that fog computing can address the challenges faced by real-time data transmission in agricultural management systems, such as latency, bandwidth limitations, and data security (Singh et al., 2022).
The integration of edge and fog computing in real-time irrigation management systems is crucial for achieving fully automated, scalable, and reliable solutions. As the demand for autonomous irrigation management grows, these technologies will play a pivotal role in enabling faster decision-making, reduced latency, improved resource utilization, and seamless integration across the irrigation management pipeline (Tran et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020). By bringing computation and analytics closer to the data source and distributing processing and storage across the network, edge and fog computing can significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of automated irrigation systems, contributing to the overall goal of addressing the global food challenge through optimized water resource management and increased agricultural productivity (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022; Singh et al., 2022).

3.3. Automation of Data Collection
The automation of data collection is a critical component in the development of real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems that integrate IoT and machine learning technologies. It enables the efficient gathering of vital information about crop health, environmental conditions, and water requirements, which is essential for enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity. Two key aspects of automated data collection are the use of advanced sensing technologies for non-invasive plant stress detection and the implementation of wireless sensor networks and energy-efficient communication protocols for large-scale, long-term data collection.
Advanced sensing technologies, such as hyperspectral imaging and thermal sensing, have emerged as powerful tools for non-invasive plant stress detection in automated irrigation management systems. These technologies provide valuable information about crop traits, enabling early and accurate detection of plant health issues (Triantafyllou et al., 2019). Triantafyllou et al. (2019) propose a comprehensive reference architecture model that incorporates advanced sensing technologies in the sensor layer for real-time plant stress detection, highlighting their importance in providing non-invasive plant stress detection. Similarly, Hossain et al. (2023) present a novel IoT-ML-Blockchain integrated framework for smart agricultural management that leverages advanced sensing technologies to optimize water use and improve crop yield, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
Hyperspectral imaging can capture subtle changes in plant physiology that are indicative of stress, while machine learning algorithms can be employed to extract meaningful patterns from the spectral data and classify different stress types (Araus et al., 2014). Thermal sensing can detect changes in canopy temperature, which is influenced by factors such as plant water status (Li et al., 2019). By monitoring canopy temperature and comparing it to reference values, automated irrigation systems can detect plant water stress and trigger irrigation events to maintain optimal plant health and productivity (Li et al., 2019).
The integration of advanced sensing technologies in automated irrigation management systems has the potential to revolutionize precision agriculture. Jiang et al. (2019) demonstrate the effectiveness of a deep learning-based model in accurately detecting leaf spot diseases, highlighting the importance of image augmentation and deep learning algorithms in enhancing the model's performance.
Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and energy-efficient communication protocols have the potential to significantly improve the efficiency and reliability of data collection in large-scale, long-term irrigation systems. WSNs offer a cost-effective and scalable solution for real-time data collection in large-scale irrigation systems, providing remote monitoring and automated control capabilities (Mehdizadeh et al., 2020). Nishiura and Yamamoto (2021) propose a novel sensor network system that utilizes drones and wireless power transfer to autonomously collect environmental data from sensor nodes in vast agricultural fields, reducing operational costs and enhancing the efficiency of data collection. Similarly, Higashiura and Yamamoto (2021) introduce a network system that employs UAVs and LoRa communication to efficiently collect environmental data from sensor nodes distributed across large farmlands, optimizing data collection and reducing travel distance and time.
Energy-efficient communication protocols are crucial for ensuring reliable data transmission in challenging environmental conditions and extending the lifespan of sensor nodes (Mehdizadeh et al., 2020). Al-Ali et al. (2023) investigate the potential of WSNs and energy-efficient communication protocols for data collection in large-scale, long-term irrigation systems, discussing the challenges and opportunities of using these technologies to improve the efficiency and reliability of real-time data collection in irrigation management. Mehdizadeh et al. (2020) emphasize the need for careful consideration of factors such as data accuracy, energy consumption, and network reliability when designing effective WSNs for irrigation management, enabling timely irrigation decisions and improved crop yields.
The automation of data collection through the use of advanced sensing technologies and wireless sensor networks is essential for achieving fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management. By enabling non-invasive plant stress detection and large-scale, long-term data collection, these technologies contribute to the overall goal of optimizing water resource management and increasing agricultural productivity. The integration of these technologies in real-time, end-to-end automated irrigation management systems has the potential to enhance agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity, ultimately contributing to the development of fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management solutions.

3.4: Real-Time Data Transmission Protocols and Technologies
Real-time data transmission is a critical component of automated irrigation management systems, as it enables the timely delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of suitable protocols and network architectures is essential for ensuring efficient and reliable data transmission in these systems, contributing to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.
The Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol has emerged as a popular choice for real-time data transmission in IoT networks, including those used for automated irrigation management. MQTT is a lightweight, publish-subscribe protocol designed for constrained devices and low-bandwidth networks (Author, 2019). Its simplicity and low overhead make it well-suited for IoT applications where data transmission speed and energy efficiency are critical (Saranyadevi et al., 2022). MQTT provides three Quality of Service (QoS) levels, ensuring data reliability in real-time scenarios (Author, 2019). Chen et al. (2020) proposed novel algorithms to improve data exchange efficiency and handle rerouting in MQTT-based IoT networks for automated irrigation management systems. Their TBRouting algorithm efficiently finds the shortest paths for data transmission, while the Rerouting algorithm effectively handles the rerouting of topic-based session flows when a broker crashes. The combination of these algorithms can significantly improve the performance and reliability of automated irrigation management systems (Chen et al., 2020).
Client-server IoT networks, such as those based on MQTT, play a crucial role in real-time data transmission for automated irrigation management systems. In these networks, sensors and devices (clients) publish data to a central broker (server), which then distributes the data to subscribed clients (Verma et al., 2021). This architecture enables efficient data collection, processing, and dissemination, facilitating the integration of various components within the automated irrigation management pipeline. Verma et al. (2021) proposed an architecture for healthcare monitoring systems using IoT and communication protocols, which provides a comprehensive overview of existing approaches and highlights challenges and opportunities in the field. Although focused on healthcare, the insights from this study can be applied to automated irrigation management systems, emphasizing the importance of interoperability and standardization for seamless integration (Verma et al., 2021).
In addition to MQTT, other application layer protocols such as XMPP, CoAP, SOAP, and HTTP have been explored for real-time data transmission in IoT networks. Each protocol has its strengths and weaknesses, making them suitable for different applications and scenarios. XMPP (Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol) is an open-standard protocol that supports real-time messaging, presence, and request-response services (Saint-Andre, 2011). CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) is a specialized web transfer protocol designed for use with constrained nodes and networks in the Internet of Things (Shelby et al., 2014). SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol for exchanging structured information in the implementation of web services, while HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web (Fielding et al., 1999).
Motamedi and Villányi (2022) compared and evaluated wireless communication protocols for the implementation of smart irrigation systems in greenhouses, considering factors such as power consumption, range, reliability, and scalability. They found that ZigBee is the most suitable local communication protocol for greenhouse irrigation due to its large number of nodes and long range, while MQTT is the recommended messaging protocol for smart irrigation systems due to its TCP transport protocol and quality of service (QoS) options. GSM is a reliable and cost-effective global communication protocol for greenhouse irrigation, providing wide coverage and low cost (Motamedi & Villányi, 2022).
Syafarinda et al. (2018) investigated the use of the MQTT protocol in a precision agriculture system using a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). They found that MQTT is suitable for use in IoT applications due to its lightweight, simple, and low bandwidth requirements. The average data transmission speed using the MQTT protocol was approximately 1 second, demonstrating its effectiveness for real-time data transmission in precision agriculture systems (Syafarinda et al., 2018).
The choice of application layer protocol for real-time irrigation management depends on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. MQTT and RTPS (Real-Time Publish-Subscribe) are both suitable for real-time data transmission in IoT systems, but they have different strengths and weaknesses. MQTT is a better choice for applications that require low latency and high throughput, while RTPS is a better choice for applications that require high reliability and low latency (Sanchez-Iborra & Skarmeta, 2021). The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of various application layer protocols, provides valuable insights into the suitability of these technologies for real-time data transmission in automated irrigation management systems.
In summary, real-time data transmission protocols and technologies play a vital role in the automation of irrigation management systems, enabling the efficient and reliable delivery of sensor data to the cloud for processing and decision-making. The exploration of MQTT and client-server IoT networks, along with the comparison of application layer protocols, highlights the importance of selecting suitable technologies based on factors such as data transmission speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. By leveraging these technologies, automated irrigation management systems can achieve seamless integration and contribute to the overall goal of enhancing agricultural water use efficiency and crop productivity.

3.5. Challenges and Solutions in Real-Time Data Transmission
Following the exploration of data collection, processing at the edge and fog, and automation in previous sections, we now turn to the critical aspect of real-time data transmission. While essential for automated irrigation management, this stage presents unique challenges that must be addressed to ensure system efficiency and reliability.
Obstacles in Real-Time Data Transmission
Agricultural environments present unique challenges for real-time data transmission, directly impacting the effectiveness of automated irrigation systems. Environmental factors can significantly disrupt wireless communication. Adverse weather conditions such as heavy rain, fog, and high winds can weaken or even block radio signals, leading to data loss and compromised system performance. Physical obstacles like trees, buildings, and uneven terrain further complicate signal propagation, creating reliability issues (Jukan et al., 2017; Yi & Ji, 2014; Zhang, Chang & Baoguo, 2018). These environmental challenges necessitate robust communication protocols and network architectures that can ensure consistent and reliable data flow.
In addition to environmental factors, technical limitations also present significant obstacles. Large-scale agricultural operations often demand long-distance data transmission, which can be hindered by the limited range of certain wireless communication protocols. Network congestion, occurring when multiple sensors transmit data concurrently, can lead to delays and potential data loss, further complicating real-time decision-making (Hameed et al., 2020). To mitigate these issues, researchers have investigated the potential of cognitive radio networks (CRNs) and dynamic spectrum access (DSA) for optimizing spectrum utilization and reducing interference (Righi et al., 2017; Shafi et al., 2018; Trigka & Dritsas, 2022). CRNs enable devices to intelligently sense and adapt to the surrounding radio environment, dynamically adjusting transmission parameters to avoid interference and improve communication efficiency. DSA, on the other hand, facilitates the dynamic allocation of unused spectrum, enhancing spectrum utilization and reducing congestion.
Furthermore, data security and privacy are paramount concerns in real-time irrigation systems. The sensitive nature of agricultural data, such as crop yields and farm management practices, necessitates robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access and data breaches (Gupta et al., 2020). Implementing secure communication protocols, authentication mechanisms, and encryption techniques is essential to protect data integrity and ensure the trustworthiness of the system.
Investigating Data Optimization Techniques
To enhance the efficiency and reliability of real-time data transmission in automated irrigation systems, researchers have explored a range of data optimization techniques. Data compression techniques aim to reduce the size of data packets transmitted over the network, minimizing bandwidth requirements and improving transmission speed (Rady et al., 2020; Karim et al., 2023). Lossless compression algorithms, such as Huffman coding and LZW, preserve data integrity while effectively reducing data size, ensuring that no information is lost during transmission (Cui, 2023). Lossy compression algorithms, such as JPEG and MP3, offer higher compression ratios but introduce a controlled level of data loss, which may be acceptable for certain applications where some loss of precision is tolerable (Karim et al., 2023). The choice between lossless and lossy compression depends on the specific application and the trade-off between data size and accuracy.
Data aggregation techniques provide another effective approach to optimize data transmission. By aggregating multiple sensor readings into a single representative value, such as average soil moisture or temperature, the number of transmissions can be significantly reduced, conserving bandwidth and energy resources (Cui, 2023). This is particularly beneficial in large-scale irrigation systems where numerous sensors are deployed across vast areas, generating substantial amounts of data. Additionally, data filtering techniques play a crucial role in improving data quality and reliability. Kalman filters and particle filters can effectively remove noise and outliers from sensor data, ensuring that only accurate and relevant information is transmitted and used for decision-making (Cui, 2023). This is essential for preventing erroneous data from influencing irrigation decisions and potentially leading to suboptimal water management.
Sensor calibration, drift correction, and fault detection are essential for maintaining data accuracy and reliability (Dos Santos et al., 2023). Regular calibration ensures that sensors provide accurate measurements over time, while drift correction techniques account for gradual changes in sensor readings due to environmental factors or aging. Fault detection mechanisms can identify and address sensor malfunctions or anomalies, preventing erroneous data from influencing irrigation decisions and potentially harming crops or wasting water.
Addressing the Challenges
Effectively addressing the challenges in real-time data transmission requires a multifaceted approach that encompasses environmental, technical, and data-related considerations. Implementing robust and adaptive communication protocols is crucial for overcoming interference and signal degradation caused by weather conditions and physical obstacles. Selecting appropriate protocols, such as LoRa or ZigBee, with suitable range and penetration capabilities can ensure reliable data transmission in challenging agricultural environments (Motamedi & Villányi, 2022). Additionally, employing techniques like frequency hopping and error correction codes can further improve communication resilience and mitigate data loss.
Optimizing network architecture is another key consideration. Deploying a distributed network architecture with edge and fog computing capabilities can significantly enhance data processing and transmission efficiency (Abdel Nasser et al., 2020; Tran et al., 2019). Edge devices can perform initial data processing and aggregation tasks, reducing the amount of data transmitted to the cloud and minimizing latency, while fog nodes can provide additional processing power and storage closer to the data source, enhancing scalability and reliability. This distributed approach alleviates the burden on the central cloud server and allows for more responsive and efficient irrigation management.
Data optimization techniques play a vital role in reducing bandwidth requirements and improving transmission efficiency. The choice of data compression, aggregation, and filtering techniques should be tailored to the specific requirements of the irrigation system, considering factors such as data type, accuracy needs, and available bandwidth. By carefully selecting and implementing these techniques, the overall performance and effectiveness of real-time irrigation systems can be significantly enhanced, leading to more sustainable water management practices and improved agricultural productivity.
By addressing these challenges and implementing appropriate solutions, real-time data transmission can become a reliable and efficient component of automated irrigation systems, contributing to the overall goal of achieving sustainable and productive agriculture in the face of growing food demands and water scarcity.

3.6. IoT Network Architectures and Variable Rate Irrigation (VRI) for Real-Time Irrigation
Real-time irrigation management systems heavily rely on the efficient and reliable transmission of data from sensors and weather stations to the cloud for processing and decision-making. However, agricultural environments present unique challenges to wireless communication, including adverse weather conditions, physical obstacles, and the limitations of wireless technologies. These challenges necessitate robust and adaptive solutions to ensure the consistent and timely flow of data, enabling truly autonomous irrigation scheduling.
Environmental factors, such as heavy rain, fog, and strong winds, can significantly disrupt wireless communication by attenuating or even blocking radio signals, leading to data loss and compromised system performance (Ed-daoudi et al., 2023; Jukan et al., 2017; Yi & Ji, 2014; Zhang, Chang & Baoguo, 2018). Dense vegetation, buildings, and uneven terrain create further complications by causing multipath propagation and shadowing effects (Yim et al., 2018; Gautam and Pagay, 2020). The study by Yim et al. (2018) on LoRa networks in a tree farm environment exemplifies these challenges, revealing reduced communication range and data reliability compared to theoretical expectations. This underscores the need for carefully selecting and optimizing communication protocols and network parameters to ensure reliable data transmission in such environments.
The study by Guzinski et al. (2014a) using a modified TSEB model further highlights the importance of high-resolution data in accurately capturing the spatial and temporal dynamics of energy fluxes influenced by environmental factors. This emphasizes the need for advanced data acquisition and processing techniques that can effectively represent the complexities of agricultural settings.
The limitations of traditional wireless communication technologies, such as limited range and network congestion, pose additional challenges for large-scale agricultural operations. Long-distance data transmission can be hindered by range limitations, while network congestion arising from numerous sensors transmitting concurrently can lead to delays and data loss, hindering real-time decision-making (Hameed et al., 2020). Addressing these challenges requires the exploration of advanced networking technologies that can optimize spectrum utilization, mitigate interference, and improve reliability and efficiency.
Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) and Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) offer promising solutions for optimizing wireless communication in agricultural settings. CRNs empower devices with the ability to intelligently sense and adapt to the surrounding radio environment, dynamically adjusting transmission parameters to avoid interference and improve communication efficiency (Righi et al., 2017; Shafi et al., 2018; Trigka & Dritsas, 2022). Research has explored the potential of CRNs in predicting Radio Frequency (RF) power to avoid noisy channels and optimize spectrum utilization (Iliya et al., 2014; Iliya et al., 2014). These studies demonstrate the effectiveness of combining optimization algorithms with artificial neural networks (ANNs) to enhance the accuracy and generalization of RF power prediction, enabling CRNs to make informed decisions about channel selection and avoid interference.
DSA complements CRN technology by dynamically allocating unused spectrum, further enhancing spectrum utilization and reducing congestion (Shi et al., 2023). The numerical model developed by Shi et al. (2023) showcases the potential of CRNs and DSA for optimizing wireless communication in challenging environments.
The integration of CRNs and DSA into the IoT network architecture requires careful consideration of spectrum sensing techniques, network topology, and data security. Research on cooperative spectrum sensing suggests that distributed approaches, where sensor nodes collaborate and share information, can significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of spectrum sensing, particularly in dynamic environments (Trigka and Dritsas, 2022; Khalid & Yu, 2019). This collaborative approach enables a more comprehensive understanding of the radio environment and facilitates the identification of available frequency bands for data transmission.
The choice of network topology also impacts the performance and scalability of CRN-based irrigation systems. Mesh networks, where sensor nodes are interconnected and relay data for each other, offer enhanced resilience and coverage compared to star topologies where nodes communicate directly with a central gateway (Akyildiz & Vuran, 2010). However, mesh networks can be more complex to manage and may introduce additional routing overhead. The trade-off between network resilience and complexity needs to be carefully evaluated to select the most appropriate topology for a specific agricultural setting.
Data security and privacy are paramount concerns in IoT-based irrigation systems due to the sensitive nature of agricultural data (Gupta et al., 2020). Implementing secure communication protocols, authentication mechanisms, and encryption techniques is essential for protecting data integrity and ensuring system trustworthiness. Research on secure spectrum leasing and resource allocation algorithms for CR-WSN-based irrigation systems has demonstrated the potential of these technologies for enhancing security and efficiency (Hassan, 2023; Afghah et al., 2018).
In conclusion, the development of effective and reliable real-time irrigation management systems requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the challenges of data transmission in agricultural environments. The integration of robust and adaptive communication protocols, optimized network architectures, and advanced networking technologies like CRNs and DSA, along with a focus on data security and privacy, can contribute significantly to achieving the goal of autonomous and efficient irrigation scheduling.
4. AUTOMATED DATA PROCESSING IN THE CLOUD
4.1. Data Quality and Preprocessing
Data quality is paramount in automated irrigation systems as it directly influences the effectiveness of decision-making and water use efficiency. Issues like missing values, inconsistencies, and outliers arising from sensor malfunctions, environmental interference, or network problems (Lv et al., 2023) can significantly impact the performance of machine learning models used for irrigation scheduling and management.
Real-time data cleaning techniques are essential for addressing these challenges. Kalman filtering proves particularly effective in handling missing values and correcting erroneous readings by recursively estimating the system's state based on previous measurements and current sensor data, taking into account noise and uncertainty (Kim et al., 2020). Moving average techniques, by averaging consecutive data points, provide a more stable representation of the underlying trend, filtering out short-term fluctuations (Chhetri, 2023). For outlier detection, adaptive thresholding methods offer a dynamic approach, adjusting thresholds based on the statistical properties of the data to effectively identify anomalies and minimize false positives (Bah et al., 2021). These techniques are crucial in maintaining the integrity of real-time data streams and ensuring the accuracy of subsequent analyses.
Adaptive data preprocessing is essential for managing the diversity of data sources and formats commonly found in irrigation systems. Data normalization techniques, such as min-max scaling or z-score normalization, ensure that all features contribute equally to the analysis by transforming data values to a common scale (Pradal et al., 2016). This is crucial for preventing features with larger values from dominating the analysis and ensuring that all features are given equal consideration. Similarly, feature scaling methods, like standardization or normalization, optimize the range of feature values to improve the performance and convergence of machine learning models (Tortorici et al., 2024). By scaling features to a similar range, the influence of outliers is reduced, and the model's ability to learn from the data is enhanced.
Data fusion techniques play a critical role in integrating information from diverse sources, creating a more comprehensive and reliable dataset for irrigation management. Dempster-Shafer theory, a generalization of probability theory, allows for the expression of both uncertainty and the degree of conflict in evidence, making it suitable for fusing uncertain and conflicting data from heterogeneous sources (Sadiq and Rodriguez, 2004). This is particularly relevant in irrigation systems where data from different sensors may provide slightly different or even contradictory information due to sensor variations or environmental factors. Bayesian inference offers another powerful framework for combining information from multiple sources, updating the probability of a hypothesis as new evidence becomes available. By applying these techniques, data from soil moisture sensors, canopy temperature sensors, weather stations, and other sources can be integrated to provide a holistic understanding of crop water requirements and environmental conditions, leading to more informed and accurate irrigation decisions.
The impact of data quality extends beyond model accuracy to the robustness of machine learning models under varying conditions. Robust models should maintain consistent performance even when faced with data inconsistencies or unexpected situations. Techniques like data augmentation and domain adaptation can enhance model robustness by exposing the model to a wider range of data variations during training. Data augmentation involves generating additional training data by applying transformations or introducing noise to existing data, making the model more resilient to noise and variations in the real-world data. Domain adaptation techniques aim to adapt a model trained on one domain (e.g., a specific crop or geographic location) to perform well on another domain with different data characteristics. This is particularly relevant in irrigation management, where models may need to be applied to different crops, soil types, or climatic conditions.
The choice of data cleaning, preprocessing, and fusion techniques should be carefully considered based on the specific characteristics of the irrigation system and the available data. By selecting and implementing appropriate techniques, the accuracy, reliability, and robustness of machine learning models can be significantly improved, leading to more efficient and sustainable irrigation management practices.
4.2. Scalable and Autonomous Deployment using Containerization Strategies
The transition from data collection and transmission to efficient data processing requires a robust infrastructure capable of handling diverse workloads and data volumes. Containerization technologies, specifically Docker and Kubernetes, offer a promising solution for deploying and scaling data processing and machine learning modules within cloud environments like AWS, Azure, and GCP (Vargas-Rojas et al., 2024; Rosendo et al., 2022; Solayman & Qasha, 2023). Docker provides a standardized way to package applications and their dependencies into self-contained units known as containers, ensuring consistent and reproducible execution across different platforms (Rosendo et al., 2022). Kubernetes, acting as a container orchestrator, manages their deployment, scaling, and networking across a cluster of machines (Rosendo et al., 2022). This combination presents several advantages for automated irrigation management systems.
Firstly, containerization facilitates efficient resource utilization and scalability. By encapsulating applications and their dependencies, containers enable the isolation of resources and prevent conflicts between different modules (Vargas-Rojas et al., 2024; Solayman & Qasha, 2023). This isolation allows for the efficient allocation of resources, such as CPU, memory, and storage, to each container based on its specific needs. Kubernetes further enhances scalability by allowing for the automatic scaling of containers based on real-time demand, ensuring the system can adapt to varying workloads and data volumes, preventing bottlenecks, and ensuring responsiveness to changing conditions (Karamolegkos et al., 2023).
Secondly, containerization promotes portability and reproducibility. By packaging applications and their dependencies into a single unit, containers make it easy to move and deploy them across different cloud environments without the need for environment-specific configurations (Rosendo et al., 2022; Solayman & Qasha, 2023). This portability simplifies the development and deployment process, reducing the time and effort required to set up and manage the system. Additionally, containers ensure reproducibility by providing a consistent execution environment, regardless of the underlying infrastructure. This eliminates variability and ensures that the system will behave consistently across different deployments (Zhou et al., 2023).
Optimizing container orchestration and resource allocation is crucial to minimizing latency and maximizing throughput in real-time data processing pipelines. Techniques like auto-scaling and dynamic resource allocation play a critical role in this context (Hethcoat et al., 2024; Werner and Tai, 2023; Kumar et al., 2024). Auto-scaling automatically adjusts the number of container instances based on real-time demand, ensuring that sufficient resources are available to handle peak workloads while avoiding over-provisioning during periods of low demand (Hethcoat et al., 2024; Kumar et al., 2024). Dynamic resource allocation enables the fine-grained adjustment of resources allocated to each container based on its specific needs and the current workload (Werner and Tai, 2023). This ensures efficient resource allocation and provides each container with the necessary resources to perform its tasks effectively.
Performance monitoring tools, such as Kubernetes Metrics Server and Prometheus, are essential for gaining insights into the performance of containers and the overall system (Hethcoat et al., 2024; Kuity & Peddoju, 2023). These tools provide valuable data on key performance indicators, such as CPU and memory usage, network traffic, and application-specific metrics. By monitoring this data, administrators can identify bottlenecks, optimize resource allocation strategies, and continuously improve system performance (Hethcoat et al., 2024). This data-driven approach ensures that automated irrigation management systems can operate efficiently and reliably.
By integrating containerization technologies with optimization techniques and performance monitoring, automated irrigation management systems achieve the scalability, autonomy, and efficiency required for effective real-time data processing and decision-making. This approach facilitates a seamless and responsive system that can adapt to changing conditions and contribute to the overall goal of optimizing water resource management and increasing agricultural productivity.

4.3. Deploying ML Models for Data Processing
Transitioning from data collection, preprocessing, and transmission, the deployment of machine learning (ML) models marks a pivotal stage in the automated irrigation management pipeline. This stage entails utilizing cloud platforms to facilitate real-time data processing and inference, enabling data-driven decision-making for optimal irrigation management and ultimately contributing to fully autonomous, scalable irrigation management.
Several architectures and frameworks exist for deploying ML models on cloud platforms, each offering unique advantages and catering to different requirements. TensorFlow Serving, for instance, provides a high-performance system specifically designed for serving TensorFlow models (Abadi et al., 2016). This framework enables efficient and scalable inference, making it suitable for real-time applications where low latency and high throughput are crucial. For instance, in a large-scale irrigation system with numerous sensors generating data continuously, TensorFlow Serving can efficiently handle the high volume of inference requests and provide timely predictions for irrigation scheduling. Similarly, Apache MXNet Model Server offers a flexible and efficient solution for deploying models trained with MXNet, supporting a wide range of deep learning models and inference backends (MXNet Developers, 2015). This versatility makes it suitable for complex irrigation systems that may utilize different types of ML models for various tasks, such as predicting crop water requirements, detecting plant stress, or forecasting weather conditions. ONNX Runtime, on the other hand, provides a cross-platform inference engine compatible with various ML frameworks, including PyTorch, TensorFlow, and MXNet (Microsoft, 2017). This versatility enables the deployment of models in diverse environments, facilitating interoperability and reducing the need for model conversion. For example, an irrigation system that uses models trained in different frameworks can utilize ONNX Runtime to deploy them on a single platform without the need for time-consuming and error-prone model conversion processes.
Choosing the appropriate architecture or framework depends on several factors, including the specific ML framework used for model training, the desired level of performance and scalability, and the need for cross-platform compatibility. For instance, if the primary concern is low latency and high throughput for real-time inference, TensorFlow Serving might be the optimal choice for TensorFlow models. However, if flexibility and support for various deep learning models are required, Apache MXNet Model Server could be more suitable. In cases where cross-platform compatibility is essential, ONNX Runtime offers a versatile solution.
Once the ML model is deployed, optimizing its performance and resource utilization becomes crucial for ensuring the efficiency of integrated end-to-end automated irrigation systems. Model compression techniques, such as pruning and quantization, offer effective methods for reducing the size and computational requirements of ML models without compromising accuracy (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). Pruning involves eliminating unnecessary connections or neurons from the model, effectively streamlining its structure and reducing computational complexity. This can be particularly beneficial for deep learning models, which often have a large number of parameters and can be prone to overfitting. By removing redundant or less important connections, pruning can improve modelgeneralizability and reduce inference time. Quantization, on the other hand, involves reducing the precision of model parameters, typically from 32-bit floating-point numbers to lower-precision formats such as 8-bit integers. This reduction in precision leads to smaller model sizes and faster inference speeds, making it particularly beneficial for resource-constrained environments or real-time applications. For instance, in edge computing scenarios where ML models are deployed on devices with limited computational resources, quantization can enable efficient inference without sacrificing accuracy.
Furthermore, hardware acceleration through the utilization of GPUs or TPUs can significantly enhance model performance by leveraging specialized hardware designed for parallel processing (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). GPUs, with their massive parallelism and high memory bandwidth, excel at accelerating matrix operations and convolutions, which are fundamental computations in many deep learning models. This acceleration can significantly reduce inference time and enable real-time processing of sensor data for timely irrigation decisions. TPUs, specifically designed for deep learning workloads, offer even greater performance and energy efficiency for specific model architectures. These hardware accelerators can drastically reduce inference time, enabling near real-time decision-making and enhancing the responsiveness of automated irrigation systems. For example, in a scenario where immediate response to changing weather conditions or soil moisture levels is critical, hardware acceleration can ensure that irrigation decisions are made and executed promptly.
In addition to model compression and hardware acceleration, distributed training techniques play a crucial role in optimizing the training process for large-scale ML models. Techniques such as Horovod and BytePS enable the distribution of training across multiple machines, effectively parallelizing the process and reducing training time (Premkumar & Sigappi, 2022). This is particularly beneficial for complex models with a large number of parameters or when dealing with large datasets. By leveraging distributed training, irrigation management systems can train more sophisticated models and improve their predictive capabilities, leading to more accurate and efficient irrigation decisions. For instance, a system that utilizes a deep learning model with millions of parameters can benefit from distributed training to reduce training time from days to hours, enabling faster model iteration and improvement.
Integrating the deployed ML models with other components of the automated irrigation management pipeline is essential for achieving a fully autonomous and cohesive system and addressing the need for seamless integration across the automated irrigation management system. Standardized protocols, such as MQTT and CoAP, provide lightweight and efficient communication channels for exchanging data between these components (Poojara et al., 2023; Jimenez et al., 2020a; Gour et al., 2023). MQTT, with its publish-subscribe architecture, enables real-time data streaming and event-driven communication, making it suitable for transmitting sensor data, control signals, and inference results (Raikar & M, 2023). This enables the ML model to receive real-time updates on soil moisture, weather conditions, and plant health, allowing for dynamic adjustments to irrigation schedules based on the latest data. CoAP, designed for constrained devices and low-power networks, offers a web-transfer protocol for resource-constrained environments, enabling efficient communication between sensors, actuators, and the ML models (Raikar & M, 2023). This is particularly relevant in situations where sensors or actuators have limited processing power or battery life, as CoAP minimizes communication overhead and energy consumption. Additionally, RESTful APIs provide a standardized interface for accessing and controlling the ML models, enabling seamless integration with other software components and facilitating system management and monitoring (Wang et al., 2022). This allows for easy integration with existing farm management systems or third-party applications, creating a unified platform for comprehensive irrigation management.4.4. Online Learning in the Cloud
The complexities of real-time data processing in irrigation management necessitate the exploration of advanced techniques to continuously learn and adapt to the dynamic nature of agricultural environments. Online learning algorithms offer a promising solution, enabling the continuous update and improvement of machine learning models based on incoming real-time data. This adaptability is crucial for addressing the challenges of changing environmental conditions, such as weather patterns and crop growth stages, and optimizing irrigation decision-making to enhance water usage efficiency and crop productivity.
Several online learning algorithms have demonstrated potential for real-time data processing and model adaptation in the context of irrigation management. Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) facilitates the incremental update of model parameters with each new data point, allowing for efficient adaptation to changing data distributions (Bottou, 2010). This incremental learning process ensures that the model remains responsive to the latest conditions, minimizing the risk of outdated predictions and improving the accuracy of irrigation decisions. Passive-Aggressive algorithms, on the other hand, adjust model parameters only when a misclassification occurs, providing a computationally efficient approach for handling large data streams (Crammer et al., 2006). These algorithms offer a robust approach to handling noisy data, a common challenge in real-world sensor readings, by making small adjustments only when the model's prediction deviates significantly from the actual value (Fei et al., 2019). Online Random Forests extend the concept of random forests to the online setting, enabling the incremental construction and update of decision trees as new data arrives (Saffari et al., 2009). The continuous evolution of the ensemble ensures that the model remains relevant to the changing environment, capturing intricate relationships between variables and leading to more informed irrigation decisions.
Research in various domains highlights the importance of online learning for real-time data stream analytics. Snyder et al. (2020) explored the application of online learning techniques for identifying relevant tweets in real-time, improving situational awareness for first responders. The proposed interactive learning framework allows users to continuously label the relevance of incoming tweets, enabling the real-time refinement of the underlying machine learning model. This user-guided approach aligns well with the dynamic nature of irrigation management, where models need to continuously adjust to varying environmental conditions and crop water requirements. Similarly, research in the field of cyber-physical systems (CPS) underscores the need for online learning algorithms to effectively extract insights and knowledge from continuously generated data streams (Fei et al., 2019). These capabilities are crucial for enabling feedback loops between physical processes and cyber elements, facilitating the integration and optimization of CPS in irrigation management systems.
To implement online learning in cloud-based irrigation management systems, various architectures and frameworks can be considered. Apache Spark Streaming, Apache Flink, and AWS Kinesis provide scalable and fault-tolerant platforms for processing real-time data streams, allowing for the development of online learning pipelines that continuously ingest and analyze data to update machine learning models (Zaharia et al., 2012; Carbone et al., 2015; Amazon Web Services, 2023). These frameworks leverage serverless computing paradigms, automatically scaling resources based on the volume and velocity of incoming data, ensuring efficient resource utilization and responsiveness to fluctuations in demand (Fei et al., 2019).
Effectively managing the exploration-exploitation trade-off is crucial for optimizing online learning in irrigation management. Techniques such as Multi-armed bandits (Sutton & Barto, 2018), Bayesian optimization (Shahriari et al., 2016), and Reinforcement Learning (RL) (Sutton & Barto, 2018) can be employed to balance the allocation of resources between exploring new irrigation strategies and exploiting the current best-performing approaches. These techniques enable the identification of optimal irrigation policies, adapting to changing environmental conditions and maximizing long-term rewards.
In conclusion, online learning techniques, coupled with scalable cloud-based architectures, offer a powerful solution for real-time data processing and continuous adaptation in irrigation management systems. By leveraging algorithms like SGD, Passive-Aggressive, and Online Random Forests, along with stream processing frameworks like Apache Spark Streaming, Apache Flink, and AWS Kinesis, irrigation management systems can effectively handle the complexities of real-time data, optimize water usage, and enhance crop productivity in the face of dynamic environmental conditions.

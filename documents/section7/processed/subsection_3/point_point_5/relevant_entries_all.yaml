    PDF Abstract Hydro-climatic information has a potential to improve agricultural
    productivity under climate variability. Recent developments in information sharing
    platforms (Environmental Virtual Observatories, EVOs) could make information provisioning
    more actionable. Here we present the results of a diagnostic study for the development
    of a hydro-climatic EVO that enables rice farmers in Northern Ghana to deal with
    climate variability and water shortage. The hydro-climatic EVO aims to combine
    data from scientific and indigenous forecast systems, facilitating information
    exchange using two-way interaction with stakeholders to co-produce knowledge.
    Data was collected through informal interviews with field practitioners, through
    focus group discussions with farmers and content analysis of documents. Results
    show that both the biophysical and socio-institutional circumstances need be taken
    into account for the development of the EVO. Existing governance and information
    exchange arrangements and lack of collaboration between actors were found to limit
    current hydro-climatic information flow, interpretation, and use. Our study reveals
    existing models of information exchange and their limitations in the study area.
    We discuss the proposed design of a hydro-climatic EVO from a responsible innovation
    perspective, considering possible future eventualities in a process that aims
    to be anticipatory, inclusive, reflexive and responsive. We conclude that such
    a hydro-climatic EVO has a potential to contribute to rice farmers’ adaptive decision-making
    in Northern Ghana, but there are challenges that need to be considered. The diagnostic
    study has helped to refine these challenges and offers concrete suggestions to
    improve both the design and implementation of the proposed platform in a responsible
    way. Keywords: DiagnosticsHydro-climaticEVOsRiceGhana 1 Introduction Due to increased
    anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions the global temperatures are rising with
    a change in global water cycle resulting in more erratic precipitation patterns.
    Consequently, both soil and surface water availability is becoming less reliable
    ( IPCC, 2014). This increased climate variability is affecting smallholder farmers
    in sub-Saharan Africa. Currently more than 600 million people in rural communities
    in sub-Saharan Africa depend on agriculture for their livelihoods ( Rockström
    et al., 2014). Many farmers are struggling to cope with challenging conditions,
    which result in low yields and food insecurity ( Di Falco et al., 2011). One of
    the main problems for food production in Africa is large-scale climate variability.
    Both inter-annual and seasonal rainfall variability are a challenge for farming
    decision-making in Sub-Saharan Africa. Future climate change caused by increased
    greenhouse gas emissions are likely to result in changing rainfall patterns. Similar
    to other countries within Guinea and Sudan Savanna agro-ecological zones, Ghana
    is vulnerable to climate variability and change ( Africa Partnership Forum, 2007).
    The agricultural sector depends heavily on rainfall that varies annually and seasonally.
    This significantly affects soil water availability for crops and increases the
    risks for low crop production and failure ( Kunstmann and Jung, 2005; Asante and
    Amuakwa-Mensah, 2014). Meanwhile the agriculture sector is very important for
    the economy of Ghana, employing 44% of the work-force and accounts for nearly
    one-quarter of GDP ( CIA, 2012). The degree of community vulnerability and crop
    failure is greatest in its three northern regions, namely Upper East, Upper West,
    and the Northern region. Farmers in these regions are faced with many uncertainties
    prior to every growing season, most of which are attributed to water and climate
    variability ( Gbetibouo et al., 2017). Due to increasing climate variability farmers
    struggle about decisions such as seed variety to plant, when to plant, when to
    fertilize, when to do supplementary irrigation and sometimes when to harvest.
    According to Ndamani and Watanabe (2013), a farmer usually starts to make preparations
    for planting crops with the onset of the rainy season. After months of drought,
    the soil is dry and hard. In the month of May, the farmer starts to look into
    the sky every day expecting the first rain clouds to appear, which would indicate
    the beginning of the major production season. When the rain finally comes, the
    farmer starts to plough his land and plants his crops. But his mind is filled
    with worry. How much rain will there be this year? Will there be another dry spell
    shortly after the first rain, which could destroy the seedlings? Would it be better
    to wait and start seeding later? He recalls, however, that two years ago, there
    was no dry period in May and a heavy rain washed away the seeds that he had planted
    too late. Finding solution to these dilemmas of a typical farmer is vital and
    urgent. Several studies have predicted the future climate of Ghana to be more
    variable and uncertain, making the agriculture sector more vulnerable ( Kankam-Yeboah
    et al., 2013; Water Resources Commission, 2010; Obuobie et al., 2012). Recent
    progress in climate modeling has increased the ability to predict rainfall from
    a few days to seasonal forecasts ( Njau, 2010). Being able to predict the weather
    and climate especially rainfall is indispensable for guiding water users, especially
    farmers in their planning and decision making ( Logah et al., 2013). Empirical
    studies have shown that climate forecasts can help farmers reduce their vulnerability
    to drought and climate extremes, while also allowing them to maximize opportunities
    when favorable conditions are predicted ( Patt et al., 2005; Phillips et al.,
    2001; Roncoli et al., 2009). The underlying assumption in the current practices
    of hydro-climatic information services is that if we provide the farmer with more
    and better information, they would be able to improve their farming practices
    ( Etwire et al., 2017; Anoop et al., 2015; Okello et al., 2011). This one-directional
    model of providing climate services has shown to be flawed, as farmers tend not
    to trust scientific information and experience difficulties in interpreting and
    using it. They are therefore confident that their indigenous systems work better
    ( Hartmann et al., 1999; Letson et al., 2001; Mcnew et al., 1991). Efforts to
    train farmers to adopt this model of providing climate services generally fail
    to improve the uptake of climate information ( Manyanhaire, 2015; Patt and Gwata,
    2002), because providers also have little understanding of users, and what drives
    the influence of indigenous forecasts ( Artikov et al., 2006). We however argue
    that science should not be a one directional effort, where science produces new
    knowledge and information and makes it accessible for end-users. Instead, the
    process should be interactive, where science and practice co-design, co-create
    and co-produce knowledge by bringing in different forms of expertise. The latter
    would result in better appreciation of the scientific expertise as well as indigenous
    knowledge necessary to improve societal resilience to climate change ( Hiwasaki
    et al., 2014, 2015; Mazzocchi, 2006). Increasingly there are calls for involving
    farmers not only as end-user, but as an active participant who is not only involved
    in use of the information, but also in the creation of it. Environmental Virtual
    Observatories (EVOs) aim to enable cross-fertilization of different sources of
    environmental knowledge on web-based virtual platforms, incorporating information
    gathering, processing and dissemination technologies ( Karpouzoglou et al., 2016).
    The first generations of these systems aimed to support the scientific process
    of knowledge creation and mainly targeted scientific audiences. They failed to
    deliver a strong knowledge creation component especially in information generation
    and dissemination projects that seek to empower local communities to manage their
    environmental change using actionable knowledge ( Dewulf et al., 2005). Hence,
    several authors have proposed second generation EVOs that emphasize knowledge
    co-creation between scientists and societal actors, and bidirectional information
    flows, so as to create actionable knowledge that can support decision-making (
    Karpouzoglou et al., 2016). However, these systems are place based and context
    sensitive, requiring a thorough understanding of the potential to uptake co-develop,
    co-produce and co-implement such hydro-climatic information systems. As part of
    a larger endeavor, we aim to design a “second generation” information system in
    the form of a hydro-climatic information system called a hydro-climatic Environmental
    Virtual Observatory. This system will use data from the scientific seasonal climate
    forecast ECMWF-4 (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts-system 4)
    model, complemented with farmers indigenous forecast collected through citizen
    science ( Pettibone et al., 2016) to generate actionable knowledge for adaptive
    decision making in rice farming systems. Karpouzoglou et al., (2016) indicate
    that in the context of emerging open-technologies for information exchange, added
    value can be achieved by removing institutional and geographical barriers associated
    with information flow. In this paper we aim to diagnose the socio-ecological settings
    of rice farming systems in northern Ghana in the context of climate variability
    and change to ensure effective design and operationalisation of hydro-climatic
    EVO. We first conduct a diagnosis of the socio-ecological settings of rice production
    system in Northern Ghana in the context of climate variability and change. In
    the next step, we elaborate the diagnostics by focused on hydro-climatic information
    needs and use in rice based farming systems. Based on these diagnostic steps,
    we identify the specific challenges and opportunities identified in our case region,
    which could be meaningfully addressed by a potential EVO. We used the four dimensions
    of Responsible Innovation to reflect on the robustness of the design and processes
    of hydro-climatic EVO to deal with the challenges and opportunities faced in a
    responsible way. The outcome of our study is a framework for the hydro-climatic
    EVO outlining its properties and processes. 2 Conceptual framework Studies show
    that crop management strategies of farmers (e.g. timing of planting, weeding,
    fertilizing, application of pesticides) are shaped by predictive weather/climate
    information. Traditionally farmers make use of indigenous knowledge to produce
    seasonal and weather forecast ( Svotwa et al., 2007). Traditional Ecological Knowledge
    (TEK) is known by a wide variety of terms, including indigenous knowledge (IK),
    local knowledge (LK) and traditional knowledge (TK). It has many definitions and
    there is no consensus on an operational definition applicable across disciplines.
    Huntington et al. (2004) for example, understands TEK as ‘…the knowledge and insights
    acquired through extensive observations of an area or species’ (Huntington et
    al., 2004, p 1270). In contrast, Berkes et al., (1995) in an attempt to more fully
    incorporate indigenous world views, broadens the scope of TEK and define it as
    ‘…a cumulative body of knowledge, practice, and belief, evolving by adaptive processes
    and handed down through generations by cultural transmission, about the relationship
    of living beings (including humans) with one another and with their environment
    (Berkes et al., 1995, p7). In the context of this study, emphasis is placed on
    “indigenous”, which is defined as native or local knowledge that is passed on
    from generation to generation. Such knowledge is used for “forecasting”, i.e.
    the prediction of a future occurrence or condition ( Daily Nation, 2017). Indigenous
    forecasts are based on farmers’ experience of changes in certain biophysical indicators
    ( Orlove et al., 2010; Roncoli et al.,2002). Literature shows that African farmers
    are using various local weather indicators such as plants, animals, insects, the
    solar system and wind in predicting the weather and climate ( Speranza et al.,
    2010; Ziervogel and Opere, 2010; Tarhule and Lamb, 2003; Roncoli et al.,2002).
    Studies have therefore suggested that particularly in Africa indigenous knowledge
    has the potential to enhance farmers’ adaptation to climate variability and change
    ( Naess, 2013; Derbile et al., 2016; Mikkelsen and Langohr, 2004). However, it
    is plausible that indigenous knowledge is not sufficient anymore because of projected
    climate change. Increasingly, scientific projections are developed to further
    inform farmers about short, medium and long-term climate variability and change,
    particularly for rainfall. It is important, however, to acknowledge that weather
    and climate forecast systems have limited value unless they can directly influence
    decisions and have an impact on the systems under consideration ( Hammer, 2000).
    Manyanhaire (2015) argue for the integration of indigenous knowledge systems with
    climate change science as a basis for comprehensive community based response to
    the impacts of climate change. It is argued that farmers are more likely to adopt
    new ideas when these can be seen in the context of their existing practices. Patt
    and Gwata (2002) for example observed that farmers’ willingness to use seasonal
    climate forecasts increased when the forecasts presented are combined and compared
    with local indigenous forecasts. As indicated in the introduction, creating conditions
    that allow for knowledge exchange between scientists, decision-makers and citizens
    is becoming increasingly necessary for building resilience and responding to environmental
    change ( UN, 2014; Mol, 2006; Buytaert et al., 2014; Folke et al., 2010). The
    concept of Environmental Virtual Observatories (EVOs) offers the opportunity to
    bring together scientific and indigenous knowledge ( Karpouzoglou et al., 2016).
    Examples of first generation of these EVOs are Wilkinson et al. (2013) for communicating
    flood risk to catchment stakeholders and a cloud technology for connecting and
    integrating fragmented data, models, and tools to deliver new holistic approaches
    to environmental challenges ( Emmett et al.,2014). They have paid less emphasis
    on how enhanced participation of a variety of users can be achieved via a virtual
    platform. In many cases, projects that seek to generate and disseminate information
    that provides actionable knowledge for empowering local communities and enhancing
    environmental management for example have achieved limited success ( Dewulf et
    al., 2005). Despite considerable progress in recent years, many cases exist where
    knowledge and perspectives of certain groups of people are either not included
    or under represented ( Karpouzoglou et al., 2016). This is particularly challenging
    for EVOs that exist on the interface between scientists and non-expert users.
    Similarly, most of the first generation EVO’s are developed and communicated,
    using mostly top-down approaches. For example, local farmers are considered as
    end-users of forecast products developed by scientist from universities and/or
    research institutions. In most cases, farmers do not contribute to the process
    of developing the weather climate forecast products ( Ouédraogo et al., 2015).
    As a result, the communicated forecasts are often not locally specific or applicable
    and therefore contribute to limited action. Second generation EVOs seek to resolve
    this problem by enhancing participation of all relevant stakeholders. While first
    generation EVOs are primed for scientists, second generation EVOs have a benefit
    to include knowledge co-creation and resilience through their participatory design.
    Second generation EVOs such as those proposed by Karpouzoglou et al., (2016) have
    a stronger focus on the processes of knowledge co-creation and interaction between
    stakeholders. An important aspect of this knowledge co-creation EVO is its potential
    to achieve greater relevance by engaging with stakeholders. In some cases, citizen
    become active contributors to science ( Buytaert et al., 2014) and EVO’s offer
    the possibility to connect scientist and local farmers via a virtual platform
    where information is exchanged and knowledge created to support farm decision-making.
    Active engagement of farmers can range from short-term collection of data to intensive
    engagement in creating new knowledge with scientists and/or other volunteers (
    Pettibone et al., 2016). Introducing new innovations such as EVO’s should be undertaken
    responsibly, especially when directed at socially desirable and socially acceptable
    ends ( Owen et al., 2013). Designing these EVOs responsibly means acknowledging
    that such frameworks are not only technical but are also socially and politically
    constituted ( Winner, 1978). Innovative technologies that underlie EVO’s might
    have great benefits for society, but unforeseen impacts are not just possible
    but probable. To guide the design and evaluation of our EVO, we build onto the
    responsible innovation concept. We make use of the responsible innovation (RI)
    framework of Stilgoe et al. (2013) which provides a set of basic principles that
    seek to maintain novelty and at the same time make it responsible: anticipation,
    reflexivity, inclusion, and responsiveness. Anticipation requires that researchers
    and organizations continuously ask ‘what if?’ questions, which include but not
    limited to what are the likely consequences? What are possible unintended effects?
    It requires projection and futuristic thinking in a systematic way and consideration
    of how the EVO is predictable and resilient to change. For example, it provides
    early warnings of future unfavourable consequences and estimate risk-based harm
    of innovations ( European Environment Agency, 2001, 2013; Hoffmann-Riem and Wynne,
    2002).The second dimension, reflexivity, refers to the principle that institutions
    and organizations must reflect on their activities and assumptions and acknowledge
    that the knowledge they produce and use has limitations. How they frame issues
    may not be universally applicable and without reflexivity may lead to frame conflicts
    or unresponsiveness of stakeholders ( Stilgoe et al.,2013; Wynne,1993). The third
    dimension, inclusion, refers to the need to involve minorities and groups without
    a voice in the innovation process ( Hajer, 2009; Felt, 2009; Stilgoe et al., 2013).
    Whereas the first generation of EVO’s placed limited emphasis on stakeholder involvement,
    responsible innovation requires active involvement of different groups through
    dialogue and representation throughout the innovation process. The dimension of
    responsiveness as proposed by Stilgoe et al. (2013) requires that systems of innovation
    have the capacity to change or shape direction in response to stakeholder and
    public values and changing circumstances. Also in this = article, we use the framework
    to evaluate the proposed hydro-climatic EVO. 3 Methodology In this paper, we address
    the following research question: How will the existing socio-ecological setting
    in rice production systems in Northern Ghana promote or hinder a possible hydroclimatic
    EVO design and operationalisation? To diagnose our case region and analyze the
    potential for designing a new EVO, the study adopts a systematic approach involving
    five sequential steps (see Fig. 1). We gathered data from both primary and secondary
    sources using qualitative methods of data collection and analysis. Fig. 1 Workflow
    of the study. Display full size 3.1 Data collection To collect data, we made use
    of three qualitative methods: content analysis of existing documents, interviews,
    and focus group discussions. The selection of methods provided us insight into
    the socio-ecological context of the case study, information needs and use as well
    as the challenges of existing systems and opportunities for the development of
    a hydro-climatic EVO. a) Research literature and documents analysis: We collected
    policy documents, donor agency reports, scientific research articles and research
    reports from related projects and programs by going through government and non-governmental
    organizations’ websites and online repositories. We specifically focused on analyzing
    local governance and institutional documents containing rules, structures and
    arrangements about farming, irrigation and water use in Northern Ghana to gain
    a thorough understanding of the decision-making context and practices. The data
    collected helped us also to guide the interviews. b) Interviews We informally
    engaged in an open conversation with fifteen (15) practitioners from nine different
    organizations (Table 1). To allow the discussion to move in the direction preferred
    by the practitioners, we opted not to use a structured interview guide, but rather
    semi-structured the conversations along topics emerging from the document analysis.
    The informal setting allowed respondents to speak more freely and openly about
    their experiences and helped in building relationships for future collaborations.
    Table 1 Stakeholders engaged in informal interviews. Download CSVDisplay Table
    The practitioners were purposefully selected based on their principal role (civil
    society representatives, policy and decision makers, researchers and farmer representatives)
    and expertise in climate, water and farming. The conversation centered on five
    thematic areas: (i) perception of the climate-water-food production problem in
    northern Ghana; (ii) current actions taking by farmers and organizations to manage
    these problems; (iii) farmers’ hydro-climatic informational needs and use; (iv)
    the value of seasonal climate forecast; and (v) the feasibility of hydro-climatic
    EVO to ameliorate the challenges. Each conversation lasted for about one hour
    and the information was recorded digitally and captured in a field notebook. c.
    Focus Group Discussions To collect information about the challenges farmers experienced
    through the existing governance arrangements, water management practices, information
    management and decision-making, we organized seven Focus Group Discussions (FGDs)
    with farmers who were engaged in irrigated and/or rainfed rice farming within
    the Kumbungu District. FGDs were held at the farm, community and scheme levels.
    Discussions at the farm level focused on the perception of farmers on problems
    of the climate-water-food production nexus and steps taken to manage them. In
    addition, discussions revolved around the hydro-climatic informational needs of
    farmers. To broaden the scope, the FGDs organized at the community level included
    rice farmers, traditional leaders, political representatives and women.This allowed
    us to discuss the place of hydroclimatic information in their farming cycle, as
    well as the ways in which governance arrangements and decision-making processes
    at the community and farm level worked. At the scheme level, similar questions
    were asked to inquire on the activities of rice farmers within the Bontanga Irrigation
    Scheme about governance, water management and how that impacted decision-making.
    Participants were leaders of farmer associations, the manager and representatives
    of committees (see table Table 2). Table 2 Actor groups for Focus Group Discussion.

    were analysed in two stages; we first scanned existing literature and documents
    for relevant information from empirical and theoretical perspectives. Next was
    a synthesis of information Secondly, we thoroughly examined them by reading, extracting
    and synthesising key information from the selected literature and documents; background
    information of rice farmers as well as insight into the socio-ecological settings
    of rice production systems in Northern Ghana. It also provided supplementary research
    data on the importance of rice in the economy of Ghana, historical and current
    climatic variability and change in Northern Ghana as well as model projections
    of these changes and their undesirable impact on farmers was established (see
    Section 4.1a). In addition, arrangement and rules governing rice farmers’ activities
    in Northern Ghana and the management framework of the irrigation schemes including
    existing hydro-climatic information systems and their value to rice farming was
    obtained via literature and document analysis (Section 4.1b). Using Atlas.ti (
    Hwang, 2008), we used open-coding methods and clustered the topics of the several
    themes. The analysis was aimed at first verifying our findings from the literature
    and document analysis to corroborate evidences and secondly to probe further on
    arising issues such as practical challenges of climate variability and change
    for farmers and the potential value of hydro-climatic information systems for
    farmers’ adaptive decision making. Focus Group Discussions were similarly transcribed
    and processed through thematic analysis. The analysis provided information on
    the rules of engagement and decision making among rice farmers, their knowledge
    of existing hydro-climatic information services, information access and utilization,
    challenges of institutional linkage and information exchange at farm level (see
    Section 4.1b and 4.2). 4 Results The section outlines the results of the diagnostic
    analysis (Section 4.1), and the key challenges reported by farmers (Section 4.2).
    4.1 Diagnostic analysis of the socio-ecological system To analyze the current
    setting, we focus on rice farmers in Northern Ghana (Fig. 2). We specifically
    explore the socio-ecological aspects of climate change impacts on crop productivity
    (i.e. yield per unit area) and not ''food production'', as this is dependent on
    many other factors than climate change, such as quality of land, infrastructure
    investment, available finance, international trade policy, and food market. We
    analyze this case region by splitting it in two dimensions; the biophysical factors
    (climate and water) and socio-institutional (actors, rules, practices, decision-making)
    parameters framing the activities of rice farmers within the study area. Fig.

    and interviews, the major The biophysical issues in the case area are mapped in
    Fig. 3. The main issue in the North of Ghana (∼97,702 km² land area) is climate
    variability which significantly impacts agricultural productivity. Development
    of the agricultural sector in this region is affected by the climatic conditions,
    such as the long dry season of about six to seven months followed by five-month
    rainy season (April/May to September/October) usually characterized by sporadic
    droughts and/or floods ( Amikuzino and Donkoh, 2012; Barry et al., 2005). Temperatures
    in the region are higher compared to those in the southern part of the country.
    The lowest maximum temperatures are around 26 °C mostly recorded in August and
    highest temperatures are between 40–42 °C recorded in March or April ( Mdemu,
    2008). The climate system of Northern Ghana is characterized by distinctive inter-annual
    and inter-decadal variability in precipitation and temperature( Nyadzi, 2016).
    The area is associated with an erratic unimodal rainfall of an annual sum between
    400 and 1200 mm. Changes in the duration of the rainy season have shortened the
    length of the growing season, delaying the onset of planting season in most cases,
    while dry season and rainy season temperatures have increased by about 1 °C and
    2 °C respectively ( Acquah, 2011; Kunstmann and Jung, 2005). Fig. 3 Analysis of
    the main biophysical issues in Northern Ghana (Fieldwork 2017). Display full size
    The northern part of Ghana experiences the greatest rainfall variations and this
    is projected to increase along with increasing temperature (2.1–2.4 °C) from 2010
    to 2050 ( Owusu and Waylen, 2009). According to Kankam-Yeboah et al., (2011),
    high temperatures that were previously recorded in March (peak of the dry season)
    are now being recorded also in January. In addition, the onset of the rainy season
    has become more difficult to predict. They also indicated that in the past, the
    rainy season started in April and ended around late September or early October.
    However, in recent times, the rainy season starts in June or July with extreme
    heavy rainfall in September or October. These outcomes indicate a potential increase
    in the intensity and frequency of extreme events, such as droughts and floods
    and a consequential reduction in the crop growing period with serious implications
    for crop yields and food security ( Abdul-Rahaman and Owusu-Sekyere, 2017a, b;
    Kasei et al. 2014). Current occurrences and long-term climate patterns create
    future uncertainties with serious implications for climate prediction and agricultural
    productivity. As re-iterated by Antwi-Agyei et al., (2012), climate variability,
    manifested at different time scales and in different ways will significantly impact
    the agricultural sector of Northern Ghana. In addition, large temporal and spatial
    rainfall variability results in high variability in river flow. As results, most
    rivers flow for only a few months a year with limited or no flow during the rest
    of the year ( Amisigo and Van De Giesen, 2005). The combination of climate change,
    intensive land use, population growth and economic development results in increased
    water demand and more pressure on the available water resources ( Stanturf et
    al., 2011). To cope with climate variability hydraulic infrastructure such as
    small-scale reservoirs and large scale irrigation systems have been constructed
    mainly for agricultural purposes ( Faulkner et al., 2008; Amisigo et al., 2015).
    Uncertainties related to climate variability is a major challenge for both rain-fed
    and irrigated farmers and water managers because to productively manage their
    activities, critical climate sensitive decisions have to be taken months ahead
    of a season ( Asante and Amuakwa-Mensah, 2014). Sustainability of rain-fed farming
    systems becomes a challenge with severe impacts on crop yields ( Fosu-Mensah et
    al., 2012; Acquah, 2011). Not only does this affect rain-fed farming, it also
    has a major toll on irrigation schemes. Water levels in the dry season are low
    making it difficult to irrigate farmlands limiting production. Farmers have reported
    re-sowing of seeds due to poor germination following delay in rains, which increases
    their cost of production. Irrigation water managers rely on river discharge to
    decide the frequency, quantity and method of water distribution. The uncertainty
    associated with predicting seasonal rains and water availability puts farmers
    in a dilemma when key farming decisions are to be made ( Ndamani and Watanabe,
    2013). In the face of these challenges, rice is a central crop as it accounts
    for 15% of agricultural output and 45% of the total area used in cereal grain
    production in Ghana ( Stanturf et al., 2011). Rice is produced under irrigation,
    rain-fed lowland and rain-fed upland systems (CSIR-SARI, 2011). Studies on climate
    change project increasing temperatures and declining rainfall, resulting in reduced
    rice production (e.g. Asante and Amuakwa-Mensah, 2014). In a study carried out
    by Knox et al. (2012) rice is projected to experience the most variations of all
    studied crops, since water scarcity, and over reliance on unpredictable rainfall
    are the major factors affecting rice production in Northern Ghana ( Kranjac-Berisavljevic
    et al., 2003). 4.1.2 Socio-institutional context The North of Ghana is divided
    into three administrative regions: Upper East, Upper West and Northern Regions
    (Fig. 2). The majority of this area is located in the Tropical Guinea Savannah
    zone, with small parts (extreme north of the upper east and west regions) sharing
    border with Burkina Faso in the Sudan Savanna. The north of Ghana is the poorest
    part of the country yet recent reports indicate that about 80% of the economically
    active population in this part of Ghana engages in agriculture, producing millet,
    guinea-corn, rice, maize, groundnut, beans, and sorghum with some few others producing
    dry season tomatoes and onions. Livestock and poultry production are also common
    in the region (GSS, 2013). The north of Ghana is generally endowed with about
    20 small and large irrigation schemes. Rice farming periods and practices are
    similar across the three regions, even though there are individual preferences
    for different varieties depending on farmer’s own aim of farming ( GIDA, 2016,
    2011). Governance in Ghana is characterized by two main governance arrangements.
    These are traditional and formal arrangements. Formal governance arrangements
    have been established by legal and structural definitions captured in the constitution
    and other working documents dependent on the context. Traditional governance arrangements,
    although ‘loosely’ framed are embedded in local and community culture expressed
    in the form of rules, norms and beliefs (see also Myers and Fridy, 2017). In Northern
    Ghana, the activities of rice farmers are informed by both governance arrangements
    ( Nanedo et al., 2014). Our engagements revealed that the Ghana Irrigation Development
    Authority, has the mandate of developing and managing irrigation infrastructure
    (see also Namara et al., 2011). The Ghana Meteorological Agency, Water Resource
    Commission and the Center for Scientific and Industrial Research are also collaborative
    institutions in meeting information, water security and advice on crop productivity
    respectively (see also Braimah et al., 2014; Nanedo et al., 2014). The Participatory
    Irrigation Management Strategy ( Namara et al., 2011), adopted in the 1990s has
    served as the framework for a more decentralized management of Irrigation Schemes.
    At the scheme level, the manager is responsible for the daily operations of the
    scheme and thus engages farmers and leadership of farmer associations in the drafting
    of schedules and assigning of roles for effective water management for irrigation
    purposes. Water is thus discharged through canals onto farmlands within different
    laterals guided by agreed schedules. The manager also coordinates decisions and
    information exchange amongst all actors as part of steps to adapt to changing
    conditions experienced. Rainfed rice farmers operating within communities are
    also guided by traditional governance arrangements aimed at ensuring effective
    engagement and resource use. These are in the form of rules and procedures which
    community members are expected to adhere to or live by. For example, Chiefs are
    custodians of lands and thus farmers who do not have family lands would have to
    consult the leadership for land for farming activities. Water is also perceived
    as a communal resource and hence farmers are expected to consider the interest
    of other users in the quest to meet their water needs. Chiefs who are thus seen
    to have the highest authority within the community legally enforce communal decisions.
    Farmers must thus adhere to agreed rules even if it does not satisfy their needs.
    In both systems, we found the existing governance arrangements to be faced with
    multiple challenges limiting stakeholder interaction and information exchange.
    For instance, information provision through Chief are usually aimed at general
    community concerns and activities rather than agriculture information required
    for farm decision-making. Most farmers thus took the initiative of obtaining information
    from other farmers or platforms such as radio and mobile telecommunication service
    operators involved in related information provision (See also Al-Hassan et al.,
    2013). Community representatives such as Assemblymen are not instrumental in providing
    relevant farm related information. Within the irrigation scheme, power play and
    gender imbalance results in bias in engagement. Results of the focus group discussions
    show that access to water was mostly characterized by power play especially during
    the dry season as only a few laterals upland could access water for irrigation
    from the dam. Thus, lands in the upland are allocated to cronies of the irrigation
    manager, chiefs and heads of committees. Women are also less represented and hence
    limited in accessing land and obtaining relevant information related to farm activities.
    Governance arrangements within the scheme also put the Scheme manager in charge
    of information directly relevant for scheme operations. In some contexts, farmers
    receive delayed information relevant for decision-making due to inactivity on
    the side of leadership. Interviews and FGDs pointed to weak institutional collaborations
    especially on information provision and use (see also Nugent, 2000). A situation
    largely attributable to negligence, poor leadership, weak communication links,
    inadequate resources and logistical challenges. For example, the Ghana Meteorological
    Agency provides seasonal climate information only at the start of the season and
    mostly to radio stations and irrigation scheme managers with little contact with
    farmers themselves. However, wherever these contacts exist they are inconsistent
    and generally decrease over the season. Private operators providing hydro-climatic
    information have limited collaboration with the public sector. Thus, ESOKO, MTN
    and Vodafone only interact with farmers without consideration of existing programmes
    and how their interventions could be embedded in them. Braimah et al. (2014) allude
    to complex local socio-political issues that affect relationships within irrigation
    schemes. These range from power play to gender inequalities affecting knowledge
    exchange and resource management. Interviews also revealed that farmers take a
    number of key decisions in managing changes in climatic conditions and how they
    affect water availability and food production. These include when and how to prepare
    farmlands, when, what and how to plant, perform weed control, apply fertilizer
    and harvest. Farmers adapt their decisions considering outcomes and what is deemed
    appropriate in a given context (see also Ndamani and Watanabe, 2013). Under irrigated
    rice farming, water managers lead the decision process with the design of an irrigation
    schedule. Farmers however are responsible for specific decisions on their farms.
    Under rain-fed systems, the farmer leads the risk management process by exploring
    how experience from the previous season and new knowledge or information on weather
    inter alia, water availability in their decision-making (see also Abdul-Razak
    and Kruse, 2017). The survey revealed that adaptive farm decisions of farmers
    are generally based on information generated from indigenous and scientific forecasts.
    While farmers were quick to acknowledge the limitations in their personal forecast
    they however considered it better for decision making than the scientific forecast
    provided by Ghana Meteorological Agency as this was perceived to be generic and
    not locally specific to their community and needs (See also Gwenzi et al., 2016;
    Zuma-Netshiukhwi et al., 2013) Information systems within the study area were
    identified to provide scientific forecast information whereas indigenous forecasts
    were tied to farmers observation matched with experience. For example, farmers
    are able predict the beginning of the wet season and when to prepare their fields
    for planting ( Ofori-Sarpong, 2001). They base their predictions on a set of indicators,
    each of which has different levels of reliability. The flowering of the shea nut
    tree, migratory patterns of birds and position of the constellation Pleiades all
    help farmers determine when the rainy season is due ( Benneh, 1970). They are
    able to predict date of seasonal rainfall onset and cessation, and whether the
    season will receive above, below and normal rainfall. Also, they are able to make
    daily weather predictions of low, medium and high rainfall (Frimpong, 2013). In
    the next section, the paper presents findings on information systems and how they
    enable hydro-climatic information access and use. 4.2 Hydro-climatic information
    access and use in rice farming systems in Northern Ghana The role of hydro-climatic
    information in knowledge creation, improved adaptation and improved agricultural
    production has been highlighted in different studies and initiatives ( Sam and
    Dzandu, 2016; Owolade and Kayode, 2012). For example, in 2014 and 2015, the Ghana
    Meteorological Agency ( GMet, 2016) in collaboration with the CGIAR and ESOKO
    provided weather and seasonal climate information via conventional SMS to farmers
    in two piloted communities (Doggoh and Bompari) in northern Ghana ( ESOKO, 2016).
    Other media such as radio and television programs are also used to provide relevant
    information in English and local languages (i.e. Dagbanli, Frafra, Gonja, Kasem
    etc.). In spite of these interventions, there are still challenges in information
    access and interpretation by farmers who are illiterates and can’t read text and
    even literate farmers lack the necessary skills to understand technical information
    because of the format in which they are presented. Also, the extent to which those
    who could read adopt the information and new knowledge received is considerably
    questionable (see also Sam and Dzandu, 2016). Our inventory of existing ICT and
    media platforms in Ghana as shown in Table 1 reveals some potential information
    transfer models, namely radio, mobile apps, websites and conventional phone-based
    services (e.g. recorded voice messages and SMS texts for more literate farmers).
    Other non-ICT means of information transfer include moving vans, extension officers,
    water managers and head of farmer organizations who disseminate pertinent information
    to farmers. Table 3 provides an assessment of strengths and limitations of the
    main communication tools regarding their utilization in hydro-climatic information
    services delivery in northern Ghana. Table 3 Overview of key strengths and limitations
    of main media platforms in hydro-climatic information services in Ghana. Download
    CSVDisplay Table 5 Discussions This study set out with the aim of diagnosing how
    socio-ecological settings of rice farmers in Northern Ghana could affect the design
    and operationalisation of a hydro-climatic EVO. In this section, we draw on the
    insights from our diagnostic analysis to outline the characteristics of our hydro-climatic
    EVO. The design aims to overcome the identified challenges and capitalize on opportunities
    identified in section 4.2. The framework consists of two main parts: the structural
    elements of the framework and the processes through which it operates. We discuss
    the process of designing the EVO through the lens of the four dimensions of RI.
    5.1 Design features: description of the structural elements Our diagnostics resulted
    in different hydro-climatic information needs, challenges and opportunities for
    an EVO. We propose a hydro-climatic EVO (Fig. 4) consisting of three major elements;
    (i) data sources, (ii) data handling processes, (iii) platform for information
    and data exchange. Fig. 4 Fundamental Architecture of hydro-climatic EVO. Display
    full size (i) Data sources Data will be sourced from two main knowledge systems;
    indigenous and scientific knowledge systems (see Fig. 4). First, as explained
    earlier, Ghanaian farmers use indigenous ecological knowledge to understand weather
    and climate patterns in order to make decisions about crop and irrigation cycles
    (Frimpong, 2013). Prior to every season the EVO will collect farmers’ seasonal
    forecast of rainfall onset and cessation date and, rainfall amount and degree
    of temperature forecast expressed on a nominal scale of below, normal or above
    normal. Also within the season, the EVO will collect farmers’ twenty- four (24)
    hours weather forecast of low, medium or high rain. Second, seasonal temperature
    and rainfall data from European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF-S4)
    seasonal forecasts system 4 ( Molteni et al., 2011) will be analyzed to also provide
    same seasonal climate information on rainfall onset and cessation date, amount
    of rainfall and degree of temperature also expressed in a nominal scale of below,
    normal and above normal. ECMWF-S4 is a state-of-the-art seasonal ensemble climate
    model that provides seasonal climate forecast on daily timescale into seven months
    ahead of time. The daily nature of the data will allow us to estimate daily rainfall
    amount of either low, medium and high. (ii) Data handling processes The second
    element of the framework is the data handling process where indigenous and scientific
    data are collected, processed, analyzed, and visualized. The collection of data
    will be partly automated. The hydro-climatic-EVO will offer a platform where farmers
    can regularly upload their seasonal climate and daily weather forecast information.
    These indigenous forecast information from farmers will be complemented with those
    from scientific forecast. There are clear differences and limitations of both
    data sources. However, seasonal information such as rainfall onset and cessation
    date, above, below and normal rainfall generated from the analysis of the ECMWF-S4
    temperature and rainfall data will be used to complement those predicted by farmers
    using their indigenous knowledge. In a similar way daily weather information such
    as low, medium and high rainfall predicted by farmers will complement information
    estimated from the daily data from ECMWF-S4 or any other weather model. There
    is potentially great value in combining both sources of data. For example, both
    data sources have inherent value that will complement the weakness exhibited by
    each without substituting one for the other and building on their respective strengths.
    The question that remains is whether information from both sources will be provided
    independently or combined. Developing a comprehensive approach to either independently
    present scientific and indigenous forecast information or harmonize them for actionability
    remained to be further explored in our next study. (iii) Information exchange
    for adaptive farm decision making The hydro-climatic EVO has additional features
    that distinguish it from other EVOs. It offers a participatory opportunity to
    actively engage end-users to co-create actionable knowledge. Farmers can share
    their forecast information and receive tangible information for their adaptive
    farm decision-making. For example seasonal climate information such as onset and
    cessation date, rainfall amount (be it above, normal or below normal) and seasonal
    dam water levels, and the degree of temperature per season will support: (i)  Pre-season
    decisions: such as when to buy seeds and which variety to buy, irrigation land
    size allocation and Labour size, which weedicide, pesticide and fertilizer to
    buy. (ii)  Land preparation decisions: when to clear land, when to harrow and
    plough, (iii)  Planting decisions: when to nurse, transplant and which planting
    method to adopt and (iv)  Harvesting decision: when to harvest and by which method.
    On the other hand daily weather information (be it yes/no rain, low, medium or
    high rainfall) received by farmers will support farm decisions such as (i)  when
    to fertilie, (ii)  when to apply weedicides and pesticides and (iii)  when to
    carry out supplementary irrigation. Details of information need and decision-making
    by rice farmers are discussed by Nyamekye et al. (2018) and Nyadzi et al., (2018).
    The EVO offers tailor made information that generate actionable knowledge to for
    decision making at different stages of farming. The interface of the Hydro-climatic
    EVO will be carefully designed with close collaboration with end-users to ensure
    effective data and information exchange with a particular focus on non-literate
    users with little or no prior ICT experience. The hydro-climatic EVO therefore
    envisages opportunities for learning and becoming an integral part of rice production
    systems in the region. 5.2 Hydro-climatic EVO: addressing challenges in existing
    information systems The main challenges of existing information systems and what
    our EVO seek to do differently is summarized in Table 4. Challenges with existing
    systems that limit their usefulness include user unfriendliness of the system,
    inaccuracies of forecast information, relevance of information, managing user
    expectation and weak collaborations. Table 4 Identified challenges in existing
    information systems and the way forward. Download CSVDisplay Table 5.3 Design
    process: hydro-climatic EVO as responsible innovation We build on the responsible
    innovation framework ( Stilgoe et al., 2013) to assess the initial steps taken
    in the process of building a hydro-climatic EVO, and to identify the challenges
    ahead. For each cardinal principle, we raised some salient questions that seek
    to guide the development and implementation. (i) Anticipation Anticipation involves
    “systematic thinking aimed at increasing resilience, while revealing new opportunities
    for innovation and the shaping of agendas for socially-robust risk research” (
    Stilgoe et al., 2013). This relates to forecasting, and imagining possible and
    desirable futures, but also to the ‘ethics of promising’. This dimension of the
    RI framework makes us ask ‘what if…?’ questions ( Ravetz, 1997) to expose the
    various contingencies associated with the development of the hydro-climatic-EVO.
    From its conception, the envisaged hydro-climatic-EVO anticipates the future by
    considering the potential impacts of climate variability and change on farmers’
    daily and seasonal farm decision making. Rather than optimizing for the most likely
    future scenario, the hydro-climatic-EVO accounts for the associated uncertainty
    by trying to make variability in water availability manageable for different farming
    purposes. Climate variability and change is only one of the potentially relevant
    future developments. Equally important is the unintended consequences which could
    be the future development of farming in the region, in terms of economic prospects
    and farmers’ aspirations. Will farmers move out of agriculture into other occupations
    if possible, or do they see a future for themselves and their children that will
    motivate them to further improve their farmer system and embrace new technologies
    such as an EVO? The approach taken to ensure inclusiveness through user-centered
    design (see below) creates some challenges for the ‘ethics’ of promising. Developing
    features that are most relevant to users implies that these may be quite specific
    and/or novel, making it uncertain to what degree the innovation will be able to
    deliver on the promised usefulness of the EVO. (ii) Reflexivity Reflexivity means
    “holding a mirror up to one’s own activities, commitments and assumptions, being
    aware of the limits of knowledge and being mindful that a particular framing of
    an issue may not be universally held” ( Stilgoe et al., 2013). It is about questioning
    the value systems and theories that shape science, innovation and their governance.
    The envisaged hydro-climatic-EVO will be developed through interdisciplinary collaboration,
    where the absence of shared standard ways of operating leads to mutual questioning
    and thus some form of reflexivity. This reflexivity prevents the natural scientists
    to retreat into sole modelling, and prevents the social scientists to retreat
    into sole analysis of social processes. Reflexivity also requires carefulness
    not to violate the social and cultural ethics of the society in which the project
    is carried out, particularly because different countries and vulnerable populations
    are involved. This was vital especially during our interaction with farmers, for
    example regarding their traditional knowledge and regular engagement for information
    exchange. A continuous challenge is to remain reflexive about assumptions made
    in building the EVO, and to what extent these are aligned with the users’ context.
    Thus the need for continuous scrutiny of project activities and dealing with every
    farmer and situation distinctively. (iii) Inclusion The user-centered design framework
    ( Zulkafli et al., 2017) adopted for the development of the hydro-climatic EVO
    strongly emphasizes inclusion. Various actors and institutions were actively involved
    in the early development process, with particular attention paid to potential
    end-users. The engagement of different actors on the project especially during
    regular workshops and trainings is expected to play a pivotal role in creating
    a sense of ownership among the farmers and other actors (public and private sector
    agencies, local leaders and chiefs). A clear example of inclusiveness is the involvement
    of both rainfed and irrigated rice farmers on the project. Each of these farmer
    types has its own need, which must be met. Also the reliance on both scientific
    and indigenous data and knowledge systems to generate actionable knowledge enhances
    the inclusiveness of hydro-climatic EVO. Inclusion is never perfect, however,
    and pragmatic choices have an impact. The particular study area receives considerable
    attention from development actors, partly because of its proximity to the city
    of Tamale and its university. Farmers with higher literacy levels, fluency in
    English, and familiarity with ICT are easier to involve in e.g. local smartphone-based
    data gathering. (iv) Responsiveness Responsiveness is the capacity to “change
    shape or direction in response to stakeholders, public values, and changing circumstances”
    ( Stilgoe et al., 2013). Funded by a university programme (INREF 1 ) that values
    “research for development”, our hydro-climatic-EVO project has a good starting
    point for achieving responsiveness. The user-centered design approach to developing
    the EVO emphasizes the importance of the user context as a starting point – in
    terms of livelihoods, culture and decision-making. A choice that was made early
    in the project to include the practice of rainfed farming as well as irrigated
    farming, was responsive to the importance of rainfed farming for large parts of
    the rural population, in particular the poorer sectors. The design and structure
    of the hydro-climatic-EVO aims to meet the needs of users and remain flexible
    enough to respond to future changes in circumstances, e.g. new knowledge and emerging
    perspectives, new technical possibilities or demands, as well as changes in livelihoods
    or cultural values. Being a university-led project with a limited period (5 years)
    creates some challenges for responsiveness as well. What about responding to changes
    when paid project members are no longer around? Finally, the responsiveness to
    stakeholder and public values might be challenged by the responsiveness to academic
    values and incentives, which prioritize modeling, analysis and publication over
    stakeholder engagement and practical application. This limitation is therefore
    recognized and in cases where they emerged efforts must be put in place to amicably
    deal with them. For example, we seek to understand indigenous forecast techniques
    and develop methods to quantify them in order to harmonize them with scientific
    forecast derived from models. 6 Conclusion The diagnostics study presented here
    offers a number of important insights that help to further refine and implement
    the hydro-climatic EVO. First, participatory design will create a sense of ownership
    among farmers. This is because, being actively involved from the design to production
    and implementation stages of the project is novel, and it increases the likelihood
    that the hydro-climatic information services developed will be useful for farmers.
    Secondly, the diagnostics provides in-depth appreciation of the socio-ecological
    conditions in which the EVO will operate. Thirdly, our reflection using the RI
    framework exposed key challenges, which the hydro-climaticEVO development process
    needs to deal with. Asking these questions, however, allowed us to discuss plausible
    solutions at an early stage in the design process. One of the key challenge anticipated
    is the reliance on stakeholder participation throughout the project cycle. Farmers
    need incentives and motivation for continuous participation. In our case, we argue
    that both rainfed and irrigated farmers are challenged by climate variability
    and limited water availability and that urgent action is needed. The information
    services developed can help with improving their farm decision making in order
    to better cope with climate variability. However, it remains unclear how much
    time future users and other stakeholders are prepared to devote to the design
    process. Close monitoring is needed to find out if farmers feel that providing
    regular data and information is too time consuming. Limited commitment of users
    can potentially reduce data availability and quality. As a response we pay specific
    attention to openness and transparency in the design process, to allow participants
    to freely share their opinions and concerns. At the same time, researchers need
    to be proactive. They should be seen as and perceived to be serious with the process
    through their active engagement. In the context of decision-making, our reflections
    and findings present key challenges in terms of language, interpretation and usability.
    The knowledge co-creation and subsequent provision of actionable knowledge must
    align with literacy and user confidence in being able to easily relate to outputs.
    Our approach and innovation possesses the potential to deal with the socio-ecological
    challenges imposed by climate variability and limited water availability. We argue
    that one of the most important drivers of success to our project will be the intensive
    collective interaction of scientist and farmers compelled by the structure and
    mechanism of the hydro-climatic EVO, in which scientist and other stakeholders
    think, plan and execute together from common ground. In addition, the responsible
    line of questioning will reduce the possible surprises and eventualities that
    may affect the EVO development. Important issues to follow-up on are the performance
    of indigenous and scientific forecast to meet the hydro-climatic information needs
    of rice farmers in Northern Ghana. Another issue from our diagnostics is how governance
    systems limit information flow and interpretation. For our follow up studies we
    aim to investigate governance arrangements and how these are enabling or inhibiting
    adaptive decision-making amongst farmers and water managers. Also in the next
    stage of this project is to find out what is the most preferred model of information
    exchange by rice farmers. . The potential of including farmers in information
    collection through citizen science potentially bridges part of the gap between
    scientific and indigenous expertise and constitutes a novel contribution to the
    field of environmental observations. We conclude that the socio-ecological conditions
    in Northern Ghana necessitate the development of an effective second generation
    hydro-climatic EVO as this potentially responds to the principles of RI expected
    to drive technological innovation to manage change in natural resource management.
    Finally, the proposed hydro-climatic EVO has potential for influencing adaptive
    farm decision making in Northern Ghana in spite of identifiable challenges. Using
    the RI framework has helped us to refine these challenges and offer concrete suggestions
    to improve both the design and implementation of the proposed platform in a responsible
    way. Further reading Agyekumhene, C., de Vries, J.R., van Paassen, A., Macnaghten,

    are important determinants of students’ well-being, as the design and construction
    of a natural landscape environment has been proven to have important value for
    students’ physical, emotional and mental health [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]. During the pandemic
    of COVID-19 in the past three years, the landscape space in campuses has become
    an important place for students to engage in outdoor activities and receive emotional
    healing especially during campus lockdown [8,9,10]. As most Chinese first-tier
    cities such as Beijing have entered a stage of stock renewal [11,12], in the campuses
    located there that cover a large area attention has also begun to be paid to students’
    emotional experience in landscape improvement. Under these circumstances, evaluating
    campus landscape quality facilitates more efficient use of limited space [13,14,15].
    Meanwhile, as public landscape on campus always serves as space for students’
    extracurricular activities, rest and socialization, its quality has been proven
    to enhance students’ emotional attachment and satisfaction with the campus environment
    through perceptions. As is known, visual perception accounts for over 80% of all
    surrounding information among the different types of human perceptions [16], and
    this has been widely recognized for its value in healing people’s physical and
    mental health, creating positive emotions, and promoting more humanistic landscape
    environment design [17,18]. In addition, the importance of campus landscape evaluation
    in improving students’ life quality and formulating more reasonable university
    environment design and management strategies has become increasingly prominent
    [19,20]. That visual perception has been widely used to study people’s preferences
    to landscape and related evaluation paradigms has been established by multiple
    scholars, such as the prospect refuge theory proposed by Appleton [21,22] and
    the well-known preference assessment matrix proposed by Kaplan [23,24]. Based
    on this, perception-oriented methods including the scenic beauty estimation method
    [25] and semantic differential method [26] have been further applied to study
    the relationship between people’s emotional status and the aesthetics of the vegetation
    [19,27,28]. In the existing research, the methods of exploring users’ emotional
    demands of the landscape are mostly qualitative, and the evaluation of their emotional
    experience has mostly been achieved through questionnaires, interviews, observations
    and ethnographic analysis [19,29]. Though new techniques such as machine learning
    and data mining have been used to simulate the landscape’s aesthetic quality and
    evaluate people’s preferences in recent years in a more objective way [30], the
    internal mechanism by which people perceive landscapes through vision and gain
    emotional experience still remains to be addressed [29,31]. Meanwhile, human emotion
    is still difficult to measure in a quantitative way and this always calls for
    more innovative, holistic and scientific methods [32,33]. In recent years, the
    development and improvement of ergonomic technology has provided scientific means
    to explore human emotions through objective physiological channels [34,35,36,37].
    For example, a variety of portable wearable devices for measuring physiological
    signals such as electroencephalography (EEG), galvanic skin response (GSR), heart
    rate variability (HRV) and eye trackers have begun to be widely used in research
    concerning human perception and emotion and have expanded from laboratory research
    in the medical field to multidisciplinary research in the real world [32,38,39,40,41].
    These techniques provide researchers and designers with a better means to measure
    people’s perception and emotions. Among them, the application of eye tracking
    is expanding in the field of environmental design-related research, as it provides
    relevant researchers with more convenient ways to detect and track people’s interaction
    with landscape features through vision, supplementing the lack of scientific means
    in traditional design disciplines to explore the relationship between people’s
    inner emotions and the outside world. The visual system is the most important
    channel for human beings to obtain external information, and the study of eye
    movement is considered to be the most effective means in the study of visual information
    processing [42,43]. During the Middle Ages, people began to use instruments to
    observe and experiment with eye movements [44]. In 1901, Dodge and Cline developed
    the first accurate, unforced eye-tracking device [45]. The concept of eye tracking
    was first developed in the 1930s, and in the early days it was mainly used in
    psychology, aerospace-related dynamic analysis and commercials. In 2000, Christopher
    D Wickens et al. applied eye-tracking technology to visual attention allocation
    for aircraft traffic monitoring and avoidance [46]. In 2001, Hirotaka Aoki and
    Kenji Itoh used eye-tracking technology to analyze the impact of auditory information
    on viewers’ visual perception during TV commercials [47]. Nowadays, with the development
    of optical sensor technology and the improvement in computer information-processing
    capabilities, eye-tracking technology is widely used in multidisciplinary research
    related to visual perception, such as neuroscience, cognitive psychology, sociology,
    marketing, geography, industrial design, urban planning, architecture and landscape
    design and evaluation [18,48,49,50,51,52,53,54]. Eye-tracking technology quantifies
    the visual attention and cognitive processes of the human eye by measuring various
    eye-movement indicators. Compared with the questionnaires, interviews and other
    methods in traditional built-environment research, the data is more objective
    and has the advantages of quantitative research and direct evaluation [32,55].
    Researchers can infer the psychological state of participants by recording and
    analyzing eye-tracking data, so as to obtain more reliable results. As it is useful
    to reflect people’s interest in the research object through objective indicators
    such as fixation point, fixation duration, etc., most researchers use 2D images
    of the studied environment as stimuli to explore the scene attributes on evaluation.
    For example, it has been proven that different components of a landscape image
    would influence its ranking during the evaluation [54,56,57,58]. Images that contain
    more greenery tend to rank higher and are more likely to be favored [59]. Buildings,
    animals and other artificial objects may also affect how people feel about the
    landscape [29,60,61]. Some studies explore the influence of color proportions
    and openness and heterogeneity of space on visual evaluation of landscapes [62].
    The in-depth study and expansion of eye tracking in landscape research has also
    promoted the further understanding of the aesthetic, practical and healing effects
    of landscape. Although existing studies have proposed that different landscape
    components affect people’s preferences and evaluation results, there is a lack
    of discussion on how specific landscape elements influence people’s perception
    [31,62]. Meanwhile, the evaluation of landscape mostly focuses on its aesthetic
    characteristics, and a series of measuring methods quantify people’s subjective
    perception of landscape through rating scales. However, few studies focus exclusively
    on people’s emotional experience of different landscape elements [33]. In addition,
    most current eye-tracking studies pay attention to mountains, forest, urban green
    spaces and blue-green spaces, but few studies research the emotional attachment
    of students to campus landscape spaces. Furthermore, the existing eye-tracking
    studies mostly use two-dimensional pictures played on computer screens as stimuli
    objects, which is quite different from the experience of observing the landscape
    in real scenes. The visual dimension of the image is limited, and it is especially
    difficult to verify the effect of spatial-depth changes on eye movement. The maturity
    of immersive VR glasses technology such as HTC Vivo Pro provides the possibility
    of conducting research using three-dimensional panoramic pictures [42,63,64].
    This study focuses on campus landscape space and takes a newly built multi-functional
    campus public landscape space called the Heart of Forest in Beijing Forestry University
    as the research object. GoPro was used to take three-dimensional panoramic images,
    combined with HTC Vive Pro VR glasses to collect eye-movement indicators. The
    ErgoLab platform was used to perform visual clustering and analyze the above indicators.
    Emotional attachment scales to measure the degree of positive and negative emotions,
    the degree of place attachment and the emotional attachment characteristics of
    specific landscape elements were constructed and used to study students’ emotional
    attachment to the landscape [32,33,65]. With the help of 3D eye-tracking methods,
    the relationships between the different type and combination of natural and artificial
    elements with students’ preferences were studied, and their emotional attachment
    to specific landscape elements was explored to further corroborate and supplement
    the eye-tracking results. The paper seeks to analyze the following issues: (1)
    The characteristics and differences of participants’ eye-movement behaviors according
    to different natural and artificial campus landscape elements and features. (2)
    The emotional attachment characteristics and differences according to different
    natural and artificial campus landscape elements and features. (3) The relationship
    between eye-movement behavior characteristics and emotional attachment. The study
    aimed to reveal differences in students’ visual perceptions of and emotional attachment
    to different characteristics of campus landscape through a promoted 3D eye-tracking
    paradigm, and to provide design guidance for the selection and combination of
    natural and artificial landscape elements from a perspective that truly cares
    about the students’ emotional experience. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Research
    Area and Stimuli The research area of this study is the public landscape space
    “Heart of Forest” of Beijing Forestry University. It is located in the central
    area of Beijing Forestry University and was completed and put into use in September
    2020 (Figure 1). Figure 1. Location of the Heart of Forest in Beijing Forestry
    University. Heart of the Forest is a landscape renewal project to improve the
    quality of the campus environment after the demolition of the former school hospital.
    This landscape space not only contains rich natural landscape elements, such as
    water areas, plant combinations of different heights, etc., but also contains
    various types of artificial landscape elements, such as rest pavilions, wooden
    seats, stone paths, and water canals made of rusty steel plates. In addition,
    the designer set up a variety of interactive landscape installations, such as
    signs with commemorative words and a forest museum consisting of a series of plant
    specimens to highlight characteristics of Beijing Forestry University. Since its
    completion, this landscape has become a popular public space on campus and became
    an important place for emotional healing during the three-year COVID pandemic
    period of campus closure. This makes it a perfect object for this study to explore
    students’ emotional attachment to the campus landscape. Spatial photographs of
    the landscape have been proven to be an effective substitute for on-site research
    of the environment, and the laboratory environment is also better to avoid the
    influence of outdoor uncertainties on research results [55,66,67,68]. In addition,
    the maturity of head-mounted VR glasses can provide people with an immersive spatial
    visual experience, which has been proven to be able to effectively simulate the
    perception experience of visual depth and distance in space in the real environment
    [69,70]. In accordance with the image input format requirements of HTC Vivo Pro
    eye-tracking technology in VR environments, the study used GoPro to take panoramic
    pictures according to the spatial experience flow line of the research area in
    September, 2022. Ten panoramic pictures were taken to cover the main landscape
    space of the Heart of the Forest, which basically covered the main natural, artificial
    and interactive elements that make up the landscape of the research area. Since
    the shooting time was autumn, the characteristics of the natural elements were
    affected by the seasons. Adobe Photoshop was used to adjust color tolerance and
    image size of the 10 panoramic pictures. These pictures were then used as experimental
    materials in the immersive virtual reality eye-tracking experiment (Figure 2).
    Figure 2. Experimental materials of the 10 panoramic pictures of the Heart of
    Forest. 2.2. Participants and Experimental Process Previous studies have proven
    that student data are representative in eye-tracking research [55,71,72]. Meanwhile,
    as the object of this study is the campus landscape environment, students are
    its main user group. Based on this, 98 students of different majors from Beijing
    Forestry University were recruited as participants. They all had normal corrected
    vision and had no ocular or neurological diseases. Students from both landscape
    design-related majors and other majors were included, as the previous studies
    showed that students with professional design training seemed to view landscape
    photos differently and have different aesthetic preferences compared with other
    major students. The 10 spatial panoramic pictures were played to participants
    in the sequence of a real experience of walking in the “Heart of Forest” landscape
    space, and each panoramic image was played for 30 s. Participants were allowed
    to view each image freely through HTC VR glasses without viewing guidance, and
    participants could freely rotate their heads and bodies 360 degrees for a more
    realistic simulation of the real landscape viewing experience. The experimental
    equipment included a set of HTC VIVE Pro eye devices consisting of a pair of headset
    VR glasses, data cable, and power cable (HTC Corporation, Taiwan, China) and a
    laptop computer with a 17-inch color monitor of 1920 × 1080-pixel resolution (Figure
    3). The HTC VIVE Pro eye here was a modified version of Tobii Pro VR technology
    that seamlessly integrates Tobii eye-tracking technology by hiding the eye-tracking
    sensor behind the lens. As a result, the HTC VIVE Pro eye was able to capture
    gaze data from the vast majority of people at a sampling rate of 120 Hz without
    affecting the VR experience. Eye-tracking data were transmitted via standard HTC
    Vive cables, eliminating the need for any external cables. Eye-tracking data,
    on the other hand, were processed using the Tobii Eye Chip to minimize CPU load.
    Steam VR platform was used to drive VR programs. All eye-tracking data were recorded
    and analyzed through the ErgoLab 3.0 platform from Beijing Kingfar Technology
    Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China). Figure 3. Experimental Equipment. The experimental
    procedure consisted of three parts: resting data collection, free viewing of VR
    panoramic pictures, and filling out emotional attachment scales (Figure 4). The
    total duration was about 13 min per person. The resting process required participants
    to sit still with their eyes closed for 3 min to restore a relatively calm emotional
    status at the beginning of the experiment as much as possible and relieve their
    visual fatigue. After resting, 10 panoramic pictures began to be played sequentially,
    each picture played for 30 s, and the participants could stand and turn their
    bodies slightly to immerse themselves freely in the virtual reality pictures in
    VR glasses. After the second stage of viewing, the participants took off their
    VR glasses and immediately filled out the emotional attachment scale. Figure 4.
    Experimental procedure. 2.3. Eye-Tracking Index Selection and Emotional Attachment
    Scale Construction Eye tracking refers to the process of automatic positioning
    of the pupil center and fixation point of the eye with the help of related instruments.
    Three types of eye-movement characteristics are commonly recorded including fixation,
    saccade, and pursuit, and its specific description indicators are composed of
    two dimensions of time and space, such as first fixation duration, mean fixation
    duration, total fixation time, fixation sequence, number of saccades, etc. Since
    vision can reflect people’s attention and emotional tendencies and is even regarded
    as a way of thinking, and eye-tracking signals can provide a natural and effective
    way to observe user’s visual behavior, it is conducive to exploring the landscape
    characteristics of the research area that trigger people’s emotional experience
    in the process of interacting with the landscape more accurately and objectively.
    Based on the environmental characteristics of the “Heart of Forest” landscape
    space, this study collected and analyzed five indicators in the eye-tracking data,
    including time to first fixation (TTFF), fixation count (FC), mean fixation duration
    (MFD), visit count (VC), and mean pupil diameter (MPD), which were proven in the
    previous studies to be closely related to the user’s emotional experience. Their
    definition and corresponding emotional representations are shown in Table 1. Table
    1. Definition and corresponding emotional representations of chosen eye-tracking
    indicators. The eye-tracking process was recorded using HTC VR VIVE PRO Eye (head-mounted
    VR glasses with Tobii eye-tracking technology, from HTC Corporation, Taiwan, China),
    and the experimental data were recorded and exported after individual calibration
    of the viewpoints using ErgoLab 3.0 platform (multimodal data collection and analysis
    platform developed by Beijing KingFar International Inc., Beijing, China). Areas
    of interest (AOI) were delineated by element type. Based on the purpose of this
    study, the AOI that described the natural elements of the landscape included water,
    arbors, shrubs and lawns, and stones. AOI describing the artificial elements of
    the landscape included natural material paving (wood pavement, slate and stone
    paving), artificial material paving (cement pavement), trace material (rusty steel
    plates), architectural structures (pavilions and chairs), symbols (logo, picture,
    herbarium, etc.). The AOIs of the 10 panoramic pictures were drawn and their representative
    pictures of scenes are shown in Figure 5. According to the research purpose to
    study students’ emotional attachment as well as the basic visual process from
    initial gaze attraction to scanning and back to gaze, the indicators chosen to
    record included time to first fixation (TFF), fixation count (FC), mean fixation
    duration (MFD), visit count (VC) and mean pupil diameter (MPD), which were supposed
    to be closely related to people’s interests and emotional attachment to the environment.
    Figure 5. The AOIs of different landscape elements in the 10 panoramic pictures
    and representative scenes. In addition, a series of emotional attachment scales
    including place attachment scale (PA) [73,74], positive and negative analysis
    scale (PANAS) [75], and specific landscape characteristics emotional attachment
    scale were used to explore the degree as well as dimension of students’ emotion
    when interacting with different landscape elements. The items of the three scales
    and how they are measured are shown in Table 2, Table 3 and Table 4. Table 2.
    PANAS Scale (Participants were asked to indicate to what extent they felt different
    emotions at the exact moment when they experienced the panoramic pictures of Heart
    of Forest in VR. The Likert scale was used as measurement method. 1: Very slightly
    or not at all; 5: Extremely). Table 3. PA Scale (From Scannell and Gifford version.

    revised and used to avoid cultural gaps [33,76]. The landscape characteristics
    attachment scale was constructed based on the research purpose as well as the
    specific characteristics of the Heart of Forest, which consisted of indicators
    describing not only natural and artificial characteristics but also students’
    social and interactive needs for campus landscape, including material, color,
    natural elements, form and structure, privacy, diversity, sociability, territoriality,
    playability, uniqueness, and changeability (Table 4). The results of the scales
    could be further coupled with the data of the above eye-tracking experiment to
    explore the students’ emotional attachment to the landscape space more comprehensively.
    Previous studies had proven the validity and reliability of the scales [32,33,65,74,76].
    2.4. Data Analysis The VR eye-tracking data and attachment scale data were analyzed
    with ErgoLab and SPSS v26.0 software (IBM, New York, NY, USA). The area of interest
    (AOI) had been drawn using ErgoLab before data analysis to help identify and convert
    the raw data of eye tracking. For example, when the same kinds of elements appeared
    in different parts of the panoramic image (i.e., stone 1, stone 2, etc.), they
    would be combined into one variable (i.e., stone). According to previous studies
    [57], the image areas that did not represent elements of the landscape, such as
    the buildings and sky outside the Heart of Forest, were excluded from the AOI
    drawing and analysis. The chosen indices of TFF, FC, MFD and VC were calculated
    for all participants for each landscape element, while the MPD were calculated
    for all participants for the landscape as a whole. The eye-tracking data were
    processed by ErgoLab and visualized as heat maps and trajectory maps of the 10
    panoramic images. Specifically, the procedures of eye-tracking analysis and attachment-scale
    analysis were as follows: The overall data of both eye-tracking experiment and
    emotional attachment scale were tested using SPSS to explore whether they were
    normally distributed, in order to choose the appropriate methods for analysis.
    According to the number of valid samples in the experiment (excluding 8 samples
    with missing or damaged data, a total of 90 valid samples were left for analysis),
    the normality test of eye-tracking data and scale data was carried out combining
    the Kolmogorov–Sminov test (K–S test), descriptive method test and histogram.
    The data of TFF, FC, RN, MFD, MPD and scale data had an approximately normal distribution.
    Due to the uneven variance of the data, the Welch test was selected in ANOVA for
    analysis. Cronbach’s alpha coefficient was calculated to confirm the reliability
    of attachment-scale data. ANOVA (with post hoc comparisons) was used to determine
    differences in the four indicators representing visual behavior of natural and
    artificial landscape elements. Mean and standard deviation of visual behavior
    scores was used to identify the specific natural and artificial element types
    that had relatively significant influence on students’ preference. The results
    were then coupled with above intuitive eye-tracking heatmaps to further analyze
    the influence of landscape elements on human attraction to real scenes. Spearman’s
    rho analysis was used to determine the correlations between visual behaviors and
    attachment to specific landscape characteristics. Meanwhile, it was also used
    specifically for scale data analysis to explore the correlations between place
    attachment, positive effect, negative effect and attachment to detailed landscape
    characteristics. The above content constructs the framework of this article (Figure
    6). Figure 6. The article framework. 3. Results A total of 98 participants including
    both undergraduates and postgraduates from Beijing Forestry University had been
    recruited in the study. Their ages ranged from 17 to 24. The final sample with
    valid data consisted of 90 students, including 15 male students and 75 female
    students. 3.1. Influence of Different Types of Landscape Elements on Participants’
    Visual Behavior 3.1.1. Differences in the Eye-Movement Indicators for Natural
    and Artificial Landscape Elements ANOVA in SPSS was used to analyze the chosen
    four eye-movement indicators closely related to the participants’ emotional experience
    of ten specific elements in the two major types of natural and artificial landscape.
    The results showed that there were differences in the eye-movement indicators
    for the 10 specific landscape elements that were subordinate to natural and artificial
    landscape (p < 0.05). Among them, different landscape elements showed different
    degrees of difference, indicating that different individuals had different visual
    reflections, attention and preferences for natural and artificial elements (Table
    5). Table 5. Differences in eye-movement indicators for different types of landscape
    elements. Specifically, with regards to the result of the mean time to first fixation,
    natural elements overall took longer than artificial elements, which indicated
    that participants’ attention was more easily attracted by artificial elements.
    Among them, the TTFF of the rusty steel plates was the shortest (12.79 s), indicating
    that they were the most attractive visual focus. Symbols, wood pavements and cement
    pavements also had a relatively shorter TTFF (21.47 s, 24.41 s, 26.72 s). Interestingly,
    the TTFF of the seats and pavilions in the Heart of Forest was longer than the
    aforementioned artificial paving material (93.60 s), indicating that their attraction
    to people was weaker than that of the rusty steel plates, wooden paving and other
    materials with unique textures and colors. On the one hand, this might be related
    to the relatively larger area of artificial paving material used in the Heart
    of Forest, and on the other hand, it also showed that the texture and color of
    the material were conducive to arousing people’s interest in the landscape space
    experience. Meanwhile, as for natural elements, the shrubs and lawns had the longest
    TTFF (340.24 s), indicating that their visual attraction to participants was the
    weakest in the Heart of Forest, which might be caused by their lower spatial distribution.
    The TTFF of the pond was the shortest among the natural elements, and even slightly
    smaller than the pavilions and seats in the artificial elements, indicating that
    the water area had an important value in arousing the interest of users in the
    construction of the landscape. Based on the specific differences between different
    elements in multiple comparisons, it could be seen that for artificial elements,
    except for the rusty steel plates, the participants’ interest in the wood pavement,
    cement pavement, slate and stone pavement and symbols showed little difference
    (p > 0.05). As for natural elements, the participants’ interests were all significantly
    different. Secondly, with regards to the overall result of the mean fixation duration,
    there were significant differences between different landscape elements. In general,
    artificial features were more easily recognized through visual behavior than natural
    features. The MFD of four of the artificial elements was less than 1 (0.57 s,
    0.83 s, 0.54 s, 0.40 s), among which that for the rusty steel plates was the shortest,
    indicating that the visual cognition processing time required was short, which
    means they were easier to understand and recognize. On the contrary, the MFD of
    the arbors and shrubs and lawns was much longer (3.79 s, 3.68 s), which might
    relate to a longer cognition processing time. This means that participants might
    spend more time dealing with cognitive processes related to plants. On the one
    hand, this might be due to the rich visual information of the plants themselves;
    on the other hand, this might also be because most of the participants were landscape
    architecture students, and they paid more attention to the characteristics of
    plants in the landscape space. Based on the specific differences between different
    elements in multiple comparisons, wood pavement, cement pavement and symbols showed
    little difference (p > 0.05), indicating that there was no clear difference in
    their ability to attract participants’ attention. However, objectively speaking,
    the visual information richness of the symbols was much higher than that of the
    pavement, so the smaller difference might also be due to the larger material area
    of the pavement and the visual focus was more likely to fall on it in the eye-tracking
    experiment. Thirdly, with regards to the result of the mean fixation counts, there
    were also significant differences between artificial and natural landscape elements.
    Natural elements had a higher fixation count compared to the artificial ones,
    among which the arbors had the highest fixation count (187.97), indicating the
    hardest cognitive effort made by participants when looking at them. Combined with
    the results of the aforementioned MFD, among the natural elements, the MFD for
    the pond was shorter than that for stone, but the FC was higher than that for
    stone, indicating that although the water area in the landscape space was easy
    to identify, it was able to stimulate a deeper visual cognitive processing, which
    might indicate that the participants were more interested in the natural water
    area. Similarly, among the artificial elements, although the MFD for the rusty
    steel plates was the shortest, their FC was higher, which also indicated that
    their texture, color and other characteristics had aroused more interest from
    the participants. In addition, the results of multiple comparisons showed that
    there were few differences between the symbols, rusty steel plates and pavilions
    and chairs, indicating that participants paid similar attention to these elements.
    Last but not least, with regards to the result of the mean visit counts, there
    were significant differences between artificial and natural landscape elements,
    and the natural elements had overall a higher VC than the artificial ones. The
    arbors had the highest VC among all the elements (62.78), indicating that participants
    visited them most often, which might prove that they were the most interesting
    to the participants. The VC of the shrubs and lawns ranked second (42.46), which
    proves that participants’ interest in them might not have been influenced by their
    inconspicuous spatial location. As for artificial elements, pavilions and chairs
    had the highest VC among the artificial elements, but the VC of the rusty steel
    plates was relatively low. Combined with the results of the aforementioned indicators,
    it showed that the rusty steel plates might have easily attracted the attention
    of participants quickly, but they might not necessarily have provided sustained
    interest. 3.1.2. Differences in Fixation Characteristics in Different Landscape
    Spaces according to AOI Heat Map The AOI heat maps were used to visualize the
    position and distribution of fixation points in the ten spatial sequences of the
    landscape space in the Heart of Forest. The results showed that participants’
    attention degree and area differed for different kinds of landscape elements and
    different spatial compositions (Figure 7). Figure 7. The results of AOI heatmaps.
    First, with regard to the fixation distribution, almost all 10 panoramas were
    concentrated in the central area of the height of the human viewpoint. The spatial
    vanishing point with deep depth especially attracted the visual focus of the participants.
    At the same time, the distance from the observation object and the change in light
    and shadow also affected participants’ fixation distribution. This might be related
    to the three-dimensional perception of stimuli by participants in immersive VR
    experiences. The way in which participants’ visual focus converged on elements
    of the built environment was much closer to the real-world spatial experience.
    Specifically, with regard to participants’ interest in different kinds of landscape
    elements, in open spaces containing pavilions and symbols, the fixation was most
    focused on these elements that stand out from the natural landscape or are more
    readable and interactive (Figure 7(1,2,6)). For example, even in a low or marginal
    spatial position, text symbols were still able to attract more focus. In semi-enclosed
    or enclosed spaces where interactive elements were not visible, the fixation distribution
    was more concentrated on water spaces (Figure 7(3)). Meanwhile, with regard to
    participants’ AOI position as well as the landscape elements distribution, the
    visual information was mainly concentrated in the upper part of the panoramic
    picture, the interactive and unique elements and the extinction point of space.
    This not only indicates that landmark buildings and interactive landscape elements
    generally form the visual focus in a scene, but also reveals that the perspective
    of distribution of landscape elements in a space affects their appeal to people.
    3.2. Influence of Different Landscape Characteristics on Participants’ Emotional
    Attachment 3.2.1. The Overall Features of Participants’ Emotional Attachment to
    the Heart of Forest The descriptive statistical results help reveal the overall
    features of participants’ emotional attachment (Table 6). As is shown, the Cronbach’s
    α of all 4 scales was greater than the fundamental value of the reliability coefficient
    of 0.7, which identified their high internal consistency. The results showed that
    participants generally had a strong place attachment to the Heart of Forest (MPA
    = 4.39 > 3.5). Specifically, the promotion of positive emotional experiences by
    the space was more pronounced than negative emotional experiences (Mpositive =
    2.54 > Mnegative = 1.27). But the average degree of positive effect only exceeded
    its median value, indicating that participants’ positive feelings were not very
    strong. Meanwhile, the specific landscape characteristics had contributed greatly
    to the establishment of the emotional attachment, as the mean attachment exceeded
    its median value significantly (MOATLC = 4.96 > 3.5). Table 6. Descriptive statistical
    results of the overall features of emotional attachment. In addition, the degree
    of attachment to landscape space and specific characteristics were quite different
    among different participants (SD = 0.83, SD = 0.77), which indicated that in addition
    to the built-environment components, participants’ attachment to landscape might
    also be affected by more complex factors such as different individual experiences
    and cognition. 3.2.2. The Correlation between Place Attachment, Positive and Negative
    Effect and Attachment to Specific Landscape Characteristics According to the correlation
    analysis results (Table 7), the overall attachment of participants to the Heart
    of Forest was significantly positively correlated with positive effects (0.507
    **), negatively correlated with negative effects (−0.104), and significantly positively
    correlated with the specific landscape characteristics (0.596 **), indicating
    that the landscape space itself effectively promoted the establishment of participants’
    place attachment and their formation of positive emotional experiences. This reveals
    the emotional attachment value of the landscape design of the Heart of Forest.
    With regard to the specific landscape characteristics, the color, diversity and
    sociability of the Heart of Forest were significantly correlated with participants’
    place attachment. Table 7. Correlation analysis results between emotional attachment
    and different characteristics of landscape. Among them, the color of the landscape
    showed a significant positive correlation with nature-related features (0.630
    **), which further indicated that it was the color from nature that promoted the
    formation of the aforementioned place attachment. Meanwhile, any two of the three
    characteristics of material, natural-related features and form and structure were
    significantly positively related to each other (0.494 **, 0.468 **, 0.491 **),
    indicating that the pavilions and seats that were built from natural materials
    or reflecting the structural mechanical characteristics of natural materials were
    conducive to the formation of people’s emotional attachment to the landscape space.
    The form and structure were also positively related with the diversity of the
    Heart of Forest (0.485 **), indicating that diverse structural forms of multiple
    pavilions might also be one of the reasons for promoting emotional attachment.
    In addition, the natural-related features showed a significant positive correlation
    with the uniqueness of the landscape space (0.451 **), proving that the natural
    landscape design, plant configuration and water space design promote its uniqueness.
    3.3. Relationship between Participants’ Emotional Attachment and Visual Behavior
    Concerning Different Types of Landscape Elements 3.3.1. Relationship between Visual
    Behavior and Emotional Attachment Indexes According to the results of correlation
    analysis between participants’ visual behavior and emotional attachment indexes
    (Table 8), it can be seen that the positive effect on the participants and their
    overall place attachment are significantly correlated with MPD. Specifically,
    pupil diameter showed a significant negative correlation with positive affect
    and place attachment, that is, the larger the pupil, the weaker the degree of
    positive emotional experience and place attachment. Psychological studies had
    shown that emotional arousal activates the autonomic nervous system, which in
    turn causes pupil changes, and compared with positive emotional stimuli, people
    were more sensitive to negative emotional stimuli, and were more likely to produce
    pupil dilation and expansion for a longer time. This further proves that viewing
    various landscape spaces in the Heart of Forest brought participants a strong
    positive emotional experience and promoted the formation of their place attachment.
    Table 8. Correlation analysis results between visual behavior and emotional attachment.
    Meanwhile, the results also showed that the participants’ emotional attachment
    was unrelated to fixation count, time to first fixation, mean fixation duration
    and visit count. This was consistent with the previous studies that people’s psychological
    cognition and preferences were not correlated with fixation duration and fixation
    count [55,71,77]. 3.3.2. Relationship between Visual Behavior and Emotional Attachment
    Evaluation Factors of Specific Landscape Characteristics In order to find the
    correspondence between different types of landscape elements in the eye-tracking
    experiment that attracted participant’s attention and their emotional attachment
    degree to different landscape characteristics derived from the results of the
    scale, the higher fixation-rate elements in the above heat map were matched with
    participants’ responses in the emotional attachment scale (Table 9). Table 9.
    Participant’s attention and attachment factors in the Heart of Forest. The panoramic
    images of Sequences 1–3 (Figure 2) simulate the visual experience of the participants
    entering the Forest Pavilion by the Forest Marsh from the outside. The results
    of the heat map show that spatial perspective significantly affected the visual
    focus distribution of the participants, and the artificial elements were more
    attractive than the natural ones. However, the visual focus does not directly
    correspond to the strongest emotional experience; for example, the results of
    the scale showed that nature-related elements and their colors promoted place
    attachment more strongly than the formal structure of artificial elements, and
    the form and structure of artificial elements more effectively promoted the formation
    of a positive effect on the participants. The panoramic images of Sequences 4–5
    (Figure 2) simulate the visual experience of walking along the stream of the Rain
    Garden from the Forest Marsh to the Museum in the Forest pavilion. The heat map
    showed that the water and the symbols drew the visual attention of participants
    among the natural and artificial elements of the two sequences, respectively.
    This was consistent with the results of the emotional attachment scale. In addition
    to the emotional eliciting value of the natural-related features as in the above
    sequences, the results indicate that artificial symbols promote people’s attachment
    by arousing people’s emotional resonance through their regionality and uniqueness;
    for example, the monument of the original site of the school hospital in sequence
    5 turned out to draw the main visual attention of the participants. The panoramic
    images of Sequences 6–7 (Figure 2) simulate the visual experience when walking
    from the Rain Garden to the Museum in the Forest pavilion. The participants’ attention
    was mainly focused on artificial elements as was revealed by the heat map, such
    as the pavilion and symbols with words. This was consistent with the result of
    the emotional attachment scale showing that the form and structure of the artificial
    elements, as well as their territoriality and uniqueness, were the main promoting
    characteristics of emotional attachment. In addition, the heat map of Sequence
    7 showed that the yellow leaves of the ginkgo biloba tree in autumn attracted
    more attention than other natural elements, corresponding to the emotional promotion
    value of color associated with natural-related features in the attachment scale.
    The panoramic images of Sequences 8–10 (Figure 2) simulate the visual experience
    inside the Museum in the Forest pavilion and from the interactive installation
    of Whisper in the Forest. The artificial elements were the main visual focus of
    the participants in these sequences. Specifically, when the wall of plant specimens
    was in the field of vision, the specimens attracted the most visual attention
    of the participants. When the artificial elements in the field of vision were
    mostly chairs, lamps and other furniture, the participants’ visual attention tended
    to concentrate more on the structures and plants outside the pavilion. This was
    also related to the effect of the spatial depth on the visual focus brought by
    the VR experience. The results of the scale further indicate that the participants
    preferred these elements because they represent the uniqueness of Beijing Forestry
    University. The sociability and playability of this public space also contributes
    to the emotional experience it provides, while in the Whisper in the Forest, the
    participants’ visual attention was mainly focused on the interactive installation
    and surrounding notes hanging on the maple tree. However, the results of the scale
    showed that the changeability of the installation failed to promote participants’
    emotional attachment, indicating that the interactivity had not been realized
    and was consistent with the current situation that the installation is not functioning
    properly in reality. 4. Discussion 4.1. Different Artificial and Natural Landscape
    Elements Have Differences in Observation Mode Previous studies have shown that
    people have different visual behaviors according to different types of landscape
    elements [29,55,57], which was also found in the results of this study. Based
    on this, this study further reveals the difference between the observation modes
    of artificial elements and natural elements, and the influence of spatial perspective
    on the visual behavior of landscape elements which is highlighted in the virtual
    reality experimental environment supported by VR glasses. This is something that
    previous eye-tracking experiments using two-dimensional images as stimuli have
    not been able to show. In general, the TTFF, MFD and FC of artificial elements
    were smaller than those of natural elements, indicating that their visual attractiveness
    and recognizability were higher. On the one hand, it may be related to the greater
    proportion of natural elements in the landscape environment, and on the other
    hand, it may also be related to the fact that the participants are more students
    of landscape architecture and are more interested in the setting ratio of natural
    plants. This shows that the setting of artificial elements in the landscape environment
    is very important for the arousal of people’s interest, but it will also be affected
    by individual experience or preferences. Specifically, with regard to the different
    artificial elements in the Heart of Forest, it can be found that materials with
    rich textures such as rusty steel and wooden pavement and symbols such as text
    logos and plant specimens in the Heart of Forest are most likely to arouse people’s
    attention and interest. For the former, on the one hand, it shows that the use
    of textured materials in campus landscape design is conducive to attracting students’
    attention, and on the other hand, it may also be related to the large area occupied
    by these materials in the visual scope. For the latter, it shows that the setting
    of landscape structures that represent the cultural and regional characteristics
    of the campus might have promoted students’ interest in the landscape by improving
    the interactivity of the landscape. With regard to the different natural elements
    in the Heart of Forest, water area was the most appealing element to draw participants’
    visual attention in almost all the space sequences. Interestingly, the reflection
    of plants in the waters attracted even more attention than the plants themself.
    The stones and slabs set in the landscape space were also more likely to arouse
    people’s interest quickly when they first looked at the landscape, but this interest
    did not last long. The former may be related to the uniqueness of the stone in
    terms of color, spatial location, and type in the landscape space, while the latter
    may be due to the stone having no more characteristics that could attract people’s
    further observation. The arbors and shrubs were generally similar in terms of
    visual attraction to people, but the arbors were superior. This may be due to
    the fact that some of the ginkgo biloba, maple trees, etc., appear with more diverse
    and striking colors in autumn, which can also be seen in the AOI heat map. On
    the other hand, arbors occupy a larger proportion of the area in the panoramic
    pictures, and their positions are more layered in the field of vision, which more
    easily attract people’s attention in VR eye-tracking experiments that are closer
    to the real-world visual experience. This not only confirms once again that the
    setting of plants in landscape design should consider the form, color and other
    states of their whole life cycle, but also emphasizes that as the most important
    landscape elements, plants themselves also have a three-dimensional spatial volume.
    So, the spatial position of plants in the landscape also has a significant impact
    on people’s feelings, for example, so considering the viewing distance and scale
    when choosing and designing plants is conducive to enhancing their attractiveness.
    4.2. Different Artificial and Natural Landscape Elements Trigger Different Levels
    and Degree of Emotional Attachment By analyzing the degree and direction of emotional
    attachment between participants and the landscape space of the Heart of Forest
    and its specific characteristics, this study confirms the effectiveness and importance
    of campus landscape space in the construction of students’ emotional experience
    and place attachment. In general, place attachment was significantly positively
    correlated with positive effects and negatively correlated with negative effects,
    and the physical, interactive and social characteristics of the Heart of Forest
    all significantly promoted the formation of students’ attachment to the space.
    These are consistent with previous studies. Besides, the correlation analysis
    of the emotional attachment scale also revealed the following three parts: (1)
    The spatial composition and temporal characteristics of natural elements in the
    landscape significantly affect people’s emotional experience. The results of the
    scale showed that the color characteristics associated with plants had a significant
    contribution to the participants’ attachment to place and the formation of positive
    emotions, and the shooting time of the panoramic pictures coincided with the autumn
    when the plants were the most colorful, which further highlighted the value of
    diverse colors in plant design of school landscapes. This is also corroborated
    by the results of the eye-tracking results above. In addition, the significant
    correlation between natural features and structure and forms proves the role of
    spatial composition of natural elements in promoting emotional attachment, indicating
    that the spatial composition of natural elements is also a factor affecting participants’
    emotional perception, which is consistent with the above VR eye-tracking results.
    This finding has not been emphasized in previous studies, probably because most
    studies use two-dimensional pictures instead of real landscape space for research,
    but the process of human observation of space is three-dimensional; for example,
    the visual vanishing point in space significantly affects people’s perception
    of space. (2) The diversity of artificial elements and the communicable public
    space they provide are main factors affecting the degree of students’ emotional
    attachment. This highlights the functional value of the campus landscape and shows
    that the campus landscape space should not only provide emotional healing through
    visual interaction, but also provide a space for college students to socialize
    freely. (3) The use of regional and unique artificial elements can significantly
    enhance people’s emotional attachment to landscape space. The results of the scale
    revealed that the use of regional and unique artificial elements in the campus
    landscape space could strengthen students’ emotional attachment to it. The memorial
    construction that responds to the history of the campus can be designed to trigger
    the emotion of memory or commemoration, such as the monument of the university
    hospital in the landscape sequence of the Heart of Forest. And the sense of belonging
    of students can also be enhanced by designing landscape nodes with campus characteristics,
    such as the plant specimen wall with the specific characteristics of Beijing Forestry
    University in the Heart of Forest. (4) Whether the interactivity of artificial
    elements is conducive to emotional experience depends on their later maintenance.
    Interactive artificial elements in landscape spaces are often used to enhance
    people’s interest and positive emotional experiences. However, whether it can
    be a positive promotion is closely related to the later maintenance. For example,
    the uniquely designed “Secret Whispers in the Forest” space in the Heart of Forest
    is equipped with devices that can store “secret” and “memory” voices. The original
    intention was to provide interesting interactions to deepen students’ emotional
    attachment to the campus, but because it has not been well maintained in the later
    stage, the equipment could not function normally, and instead brought a negative
    emotional experience to students. 4.3. Connection and Interaction between Visual
    Behavior and Emotional Attachment to Landscape Space In previous studies on natural
    landscapes, cultural tourism scenes and public spaces, there is no unified conclusion
    on whether the relationship between eye-movement indicators and emotional and
    cognitive evaluation of landscape is significantly correlated. For example, some
    studies have shown that fixation count and mean fixation duration are significantly
    correlated with evaluation results, while there are also studies that have not
    clearly found a correlation between them. The mean pupil diameter, on the other
    hand, has been significantly correlated with emotional and cognitive indicators
    in most previous studies. The results of this study show that the fixation count,
    time to first fixation, mean fixation duration and visit count have no correlation
    with different dimensions and degrees of emotional attachment, but the mean pupil
    diameter significantly correlated with positive effect and place attachment. However,
    although the former does not show a significant correlation at the level of data
    indicators, and the eye-movement index and the emotional attachment scale are
    systems of different dimensions, based on interdisciplinary theories from psychology
    and neuroscience, we believe that there is a certain degree of mutual influence
    and constraints between them. Therefore, the relationship between visual behavior
    and emotional attachment to the landscape space and its characteristics is analyzed
    using experimental results to explore their connection further. (1) The connection
    between different natural and artificial visual landscape elements and students’
    emotional attachment to landscape characteristics. As is shown in the previous
    study, artificial elements in landscape are more attractive to people’s eyes,
    even though they occupy a small part of the space. For example, some research
    [55,67,68] has shown that buildings in the natural environment always attract
    more attention. The same results have been revealed in this study. Based on this,
    this study further found that the artificial elements focused on by the human
    eye are related to the emotional attachment established, but the degree and dimension
    depend on the specific characteristics of the artificial elements. For example,
    the more cultural, regional and unique artificial elements of the site are not
    only the main fixation objects of human eyes, but also significantly promote the
    positive emotional experience and place attachment. Meanwhile, the interactive
    and playful artificial elements, such as the specially set recording device in
    the Heart of Forest, are also the core visual focus, but their role in promoting
    emotional attachment is weakened by a lack of maintenance and inability to realize
    their original function. As for natural elements in the landscape space, the waterscape
    turned out to be the core fixation object for all human eyes in this research,
    which is consistent with the results by Zhou [29] as well as Gao [55] who suggest
    that water, especially dynamic water spaces, is always the most attractive part
    of a landscape. This study also found that the reflection in the water attracted
    more attention than the original object, which may be due to the fact that it
    provided a more dynamic and unique visual experience, while promoting the establishment
    of emotional attachment. In addition, it is interesting to note that elements
    that are located around the water more easily became the fixation focus along
    with the water space, such as the wooden and stone pavements near the water that
    are more attractive than when they exist alone, which is consistent with the previous
    findings of Gao et al. This is consistent with the significant correlation between
    the structure, form, and color of natural-related features in the promotion of
    emotional attachment showed by the results of the scale. It reveals that the combination
    of different landscape elements may have the potential to be more attractive in
    the landscape and provides people with a more significant emotional experience.
    Through virtual reality eye-tracking experiments supported by VR glasses, this
    study also found that both natural and artificial elements are more likely to
    attract people’s attention when they are at the vanishing point of space at the
    height of the human viewpoint, and their ability to attract attention even exceeds
    the characteristics of the elements themselves. This has not been shown in previous
    eye-tracking studies based on 2D images, further suggesting that the spatial organization
    of landscape elements may have a greater impact on people than the elements themselves.
    This further shows that perceiving and appreciating landscape space has a temporal
    and spatial rhythm, and this rhythm will greatly affect people’s perception and
    emotional experience. Here, the importance of the spatial sequence of landscape
    elements for emotional attachment is emphasized. (2) The interaction between students’
    visual behavior and emotional attachment to campus landscape space. Previous studies
    have found that people’s emotional experience of space through visual interaction
    always begins with unconscious perception or curiosity without a clear purpose.
    This is because human visual observation is a process in which human cognitive
    and emotional experiences are influenced by stimuli that change over time and
    space. Combined with the VR experiment, it can be speculated that the formation
    of different degrees and dimension of emotional attachment of participants in
    this process may be the result of people’s observation of the dynamic accumulation
    of landscape space. As the old saying goes, the eyes are the windows of the soul,
    and people’s emotions are also the psychological reactions after the eye’s reception
    and processing of different information in the landscape space. Therefore, the
    spatiotemporal nature of vision leads to the fact that the outcome of each eye
    movement has an impact on the next eye movement, as well as the formation of emotional
    attachment. Based on this, it can be inferred that landscape elements, especially
    their spatial composition, have a direct impact on this process, especially when
    people experience the real three-dimensional built environment. But in the process
    of establishing and changing emotional attachment, it still remains unknown to
    what extent each eye movement affects it, and vice versa. In the future, it will
    be possible to conduct more in-depth research and analysis on these topics by
    combining multimodal emotion research techniques such as physiological measurements,
    EEG measurements, etc. This may be helpful to understand the process of people’s
    cognitive and emotional experience of landscape space, so as to help designers
    make better use of landscape elements and design spaces that are more conducive
    to people’s emotional attachment. 4.4. Limitations and Future Research Until now,
    the study has made great effort to explore the effects of campus landscape elements
    on students’ visual behavior and emotional attachment and their connection. Though
    the results have provided some interesting perspectives, several limitations should
    also be considered. First, there are limitations in the respondents. The data
    of this study were mainly collected from students of various majors in Beijing
    Forestry University under 24 years old. Though previous studies have shown that
    students’ data can be representative for landscape visual behavior research, neither
    gender nor nationality will influence people’s eye movement [78], and perception
    of as well as attachment to specific landscape elements is more likely to be driven
    by biological mechanisms, but students’ educational experience and background
    will affect their preferences for different landscape elements [79]. For example,
    most students in the experiment major in landscape architecture and urban planning,
    and they are familiar with the designer of the Heart of Forest, which may influence
    their emotional attachment. Meanwhile, students with a professional background
    in landscape and botany design may pay more attention to different natural plants,
    which will affect their visual behavior. In addition, all the participants in
    the study are young people, whereas the users of the campus landscape space also
    include teachers, various types of staff and their families. In terms of demographic
    characteristics, it is worthwhile to further study the cognitive, behavioral,
    and emotional attachment characteristics of landscape space for people of different
    ages and professional backgrounds. Second, there are limitations in the experimental
    materials. The study was conducted based on the panoramic image of the Heart of
    Forest. With the support of HTC VR glasses, although this study was carried out
    using virtual reality immersive VR eye-movement experiments to explore students’
    visual behavior, compared with previous studies using two-dimensional pictures
    as experimental materials, it is closer to the human experience in the real landscape
    space, but it still cannot cover the physical factors such as sound, temperature,
    light changes, and smell in the real environment. Therefore, the characteristics
    of people’s visual behaviors on site and their differences to that of photo-based
    experiments are worthy of further analysis and discussion. In addition, this study
    selected one of the representative landscape spaces in Beijing Forestry University
    as an experimental stimulus sample to collect data and explore the related issues.
    But the deviation in landscape space such as its background, seasonal factors,
    location, and even its designer may also affect people’s visual behavior and emotional
    attachment. Therefore, it is necessary to select more campus landscapes of different
    scales, different locations, and different seasons for more in-depth discussion
    in future research. The visual quality and emotional healing effect of landscape
    are of great value in the design and renovation of campus landscape space, and
    are an important part of creating a good environment for students’ daily learning
    and life. A large number of empirical studies in the field of landscape architecture
    have proven that the application of eye-tracking experiments can reveal the visual
    perception process of the public and identify key landscape elements. Overall,
    this study analyzed the characteristics and differences of students’ visual behavior
    and emotional attachment when viewing different artificial and natural campus
    landscape characteristics through VR eye-tracking experiments and emotional attachment
    evaluation, and to explore the factors affecting students’ emotional experience
    when observing landscape spaces. This study not only proves the value of previous
    eye-tracking research results, but also improves the authenticity of the environmental
    visual experience in classical eye-tracking research with the help of new virtual
    reality technology. The coupling study combined with the emotional attachment
    scale further reveals the emotional appeal to people of landscape space from a
    multimodal perspective. In the future, combined with different physiological measurement
    technologies and machine learning methods, it will be possible to explore the
    landscape space elements and their spatial structure that are conducive to promoting
    people’s positive emotional experience in a more complete and in-depth way, and
    establish the corresponding evaluation system and model. This could also inform
    further development of emotion-oriented spatial design theories and methods. 5.
    Conclusions Taking the campus landscape of the Heart of Forest in Beijing Forestry
    University as an example, this study explored the differences and relationships
    between visual behavior and emotional attachment to different natural and artificial
    landscape elements with the help of VR eye-tracking technology. The results of
    the two parts of the data not only reveal people’s subconscious and conscious
    preferences for landscape space elements and characteristics from different levels,
    but also corroborate and supplement each other. The main findings can be summarized
    as follows: (1) The results of eye-tracking indicators show that artificial elements
    are more likely to quickly attract people’s visual attention and continuously
    enhance their interest in the landscape. Combined with the results of the scale,
    it further shows that artificial elements with regionality, uniqueness and diversity
    are conducive to significantly promoting people’s emotional attachment, and whether
    playability and changeability can promote positive emotional experience are closely
    related to the maintenance of artificial facilities after completion. (2) For
    natural elements, a waterscape space composed of water and its surrounding elements
    is more likely to attract people’s visual attention, while the attractiveness
    of arbors and shrubs is related to their color and spatial location. Plants with
    yellow and red color changes in autumn and in the spatial position of the vanishing
    point of human eyes are more likely to be noticed. Furthermore, the characteristics
    related to nature are generally conducive to the establishment of students’ emotional
    attachment, which is not only limited to the natural elements in the landscape,
    but also includes artificial materials and structures that can reflect the natural
    texture, time traces and structural logic, such as pavilions that can extract
    the texture and mechanical characteristics of wood, and rusty steel plate landscape
    structures that can reflect the texture of materials. (3) Another important conclusion
    of this study is that the three-dimensional spatial structure and spatial sequence
    design of landscape elements will significantly affect people’s visual focus and
    emotional experience. This emphasizes the difference between experiencing real
    landscape space and two-dimensional landscape pictures and illustrates the importance
    of considering the spatial hierarchy of landscape elements and the spatial-temporal
    behavior of people experiencing the landscape in landscape space design. (4) The
    research provides the following possible references for the design theory and
    management of public landscape space in colleges in the future: for natural landscape
    elements, the design methods such as configuring plants with unique seasonal characteristics,
    creating more waterfront rest spaces, and arranging the elements in the space
    and time sequence of human perception may exert a significant impact on students’
    emotional experience. For artificial landscape elements, the design and construction
    of structures using natural materials and structures, and the setting of regional,
    cultural or commemorative installations, can effectively promote the construction
    of students’ emotional attachment. For the interactive landscape elements designed
    in combination with new technologies, it is necessary to rely on regular maintenance
    and management after completion to ensure their normal use, otherwise it is easy
    to trigger negative emotions in students. In addition, a corresponding relationship
    has been revealed between artificial and natural landscape elements in eye-tracking
    experiments and landscape characteristics explored in an emotional attachment
    scale. That is, people’s visual behavior and emotional attachment are closely
    related, and will change and interact with their experience of time and space
    in a certain landscape. The fixation behavior affects the emotional experience
    it produces, and the change in emotional experience will then affect the focus
    of vision. The results show that when designing a campus landscape space to provide
    students with a good emotional experience, it is not only necessary to consider
    the selection and design of each natural and artificial landscape element, but
    designers also need to consider the spatial–temporal sequence of people’ viewing
    and experiencing landscape spaces and make a reasonable spatial combination of
    these elements. At the same time, it is also important to strengthen the maintenance
    of the landscape after its construction to promote its positive emotional experience.

    The potential of using nature-based solutions to address issues of climate change
    has continued to gain momentum, especially in developed nations. However, the
    same cannot be said for developing countries, particularly in Africa, where the
    knowledge and awareness of natural solutions are low, and research on their application

    of published literature, this paper makes a case for research exploration on nature-based
    solutions for a sustainable built environment in Africa. The findings revealed
    an opportunity for significant research contributions on nature-based solutions
    in addressing flood risk management, climate change and urban planning, water
    quality and carbon emission, sustainable development, and green infrastructure
    and urban development. These areas are the critical focus of past studies explored.
    Also, the findings offer guidance for further studies to be conducted in less
    explored areas, such as carbon sequestration, greenhouse gases, energy utilisation,
    indoor comfort, and numeric models for using nature-based solutions within the
    African context. The findings of the study offer an excellent theoretical background
    to direct researchers and practitioners who seek to attain and promote sustainable
    built environments through nature-based solutions, especially in Africa. 1 INTRODUCTION
    Similar to other continents, Africa is faced with the adverse effects of rapid
    changes in climatic conditions. Increasing cases of natural disasters attributed
    to climate change are being recorded within the continent, with approximately
    4% of the population of the continent being severely affected by droughts and
    floods between 2021 and 2022. This situation places an encumbrance on people''s
    livelihoods and, by extension, their survival (Global Centre on Adaptation, 2022).
    Further observation shows that the major disasters on the continent, between 1970
    and 2019, were droughts and floods experienced in countries such as Algeria, Chad,
    Ethiopia, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, Somalia and Sudan (Statista, 2023). In 2022,
    Sguazzin (2022) submitted that approximately 15 million people lost their homes
    because of disasters related to weather, with Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia,
    Somalia and Sudan being the worst affected countries. However, signs of other
    forms of disasters are imminent. For instance, in March 2023, the United Nations
    Children''s Fund (UNICEF) reported that millions of children were at risk with
    the increase in cholera cases in Malawi and Mozambique following the occurrence
    of Tropical Cyclone Freddy (UNICEF, 2023). In June 2023, South Africa experienced
    an earth tremor that shocked many residents in the Gauteng Province. In the same
    month, severe flooding was experienced in KwaZulu-Natal Province that led to the
    loss of lives and properties (Davies, 2023; Reuters, 2023). Also, early in September
    2023, Morrocco witnessed a massive earthquake, which left thousands of people
    dead (Alsaafin, 2023). These occurrences emphasise the need for strategies to
    help to reduce the impact of adverse natural disasters and create effective adaptation
    in this era of climate change. Moreover, practitioners in the built environment
    who play a major role in the provision of infrastructure, have the responsibility
    to ensure the delivery of resilient and sustainable structures that can withstand
    the impact of these adverse effects of climate change. One such strategy that
    has proven to be effective and efficient in addressing these current climatic
    and biodiversity crises is nature-based solutions (NbS). NbS, as described by
    the World Bank, encompasses a spectrum of actions that are centred on protecting,
    managing sustainably, and restoring natural ecosystems (World Bank, 2022). This
    comprehensive approach is designed to address a multitude of pressing challenges
    that societies face today, including, but not limited to, impacts of climate change,
    the enhancement of human health and well-being, ensuring food and water security,
    and effectively reducing the risks associated with disasters. Bona et al. (2023)
    noted that NbS can be crucial in sectors, such as water management, forestry,
    agriculture, urban areas and coastal areas. As such, the built environment and
    its allied profession, which are crucial to the development of urban areas, have
    the opportunity to deliver sustainable and resilient projects through implementing
    NbS. According to Pearlmutter et al. (2020), NbS can be introduced into built
    environment projects by using green building materials, systems, practices and
    sites. Momentous benefits lie in the use of natural solutions within the built
    environment, including the attainment of the United Nations (UN) sustainable development
    goals (SDGs), especially SDGs 11 and 13, directed at attaining sustainable cities
    and communities, as well as contributing to climate action (European Commission,
    2021). Through the incorporation of NbS, there is an opportunity in the built
    environment to enhance the appreciation of recreation and aesthetics, encourage
    healthy and high-quality lifestyles, increase the value of land and properties
    through green features, and improve comfort (Bona et al., 2023). Bridges et al.
    (2021) also noted that policy-makers, practitioners and the public in most developed
    countries are increasingly recognising the efficacy of the NbS concept in achieving
    the twin engineering objectives of sustainable development of the built environment
    and protection of the natural environment. Albeit the benefits of NbS mentioned
    above, there is little evidence to support the utilisation of nature-driven concepts
    and solutions in delivering built environment projects, particularly in Africa,
    where disasters that can be addressed through NbS are becoming prominent. Diep
    et al. (2022) noted that, while NbS continues to gain recognition globally, evidence
    of its implementation within communities in Africa is low. Similarly, Dupar et
    al. (2023) submitted that NbS is only gradually gaining recognition among African
    leaders. The research attention given to the application of NbS for a sustainable
    built environment on the continent is slow-paced, considering the current adverse
    impact of climate change on countries within the continent. The few available
    NbS-related studies emanating from the continent have been piece-meal and have
    placed emphasis on diverse issues regarding climate change. For instance, Lokidor
    et al. (2023) explored NbS from the perspective of sustainable flood management
    in East Africa and noted that, despite the increased attention attracted to this
    natural solution in the last decade, studies from Africa have remained limited.
    In the paper referred to, emphasis was placed on NbS for flood risk management
    studies conducted in East Africa and some success factors required for the effective
    use of NbS in managing flood risk in the region were identified. Earlier, Kalantari
    et al. (2018) explored NbS in combating flood-drought risk in urban areas in East
    Africa. Again, in relation to flood risk management, Enu et al. (2023) reviewed
    the potential of NbS to mitigate flood risk in Sub-Saharan Africa and concluded
    that the use of NbS within the region in addressing flood risk was low. Also,
    Acreman et al. (2021) explored the effectiveness of NbS in solving Africa''s water
    problems and observed that, while local knowledge is needed, policy and planning
    for NbS are crucial to solving water-related risks in Africa. From the perspective
    of urban green spaces, Giombini and Thorn (2022) explored the opportunities for
    the use of NbS in the capital city of Namibia in South-Western Africa, while Thorn
    et al. (2021) explored the use of NbS for climate-resilient infrastructure in
    peri-urban, Sub-Saharan Africa. From a people''s perspective, Diep et al. (2022)
    explored the views of individuals regarding NbS used in informal settlements in
    East Africa with a focus on projects across Nairobi and Dar es Salaam. It was
    concluded that there is a need for key participants involved in NbS projects to
    support the replication, scaling up and institutionalisation of NbS. Nykia and
    Dinka (2022) conducted a biblio-metric analysis of NbS studies within the African
    continent that were published and indexed in Web of Science. Based on the study,
    it was concluded that there is a need to overhaul institutions and policies, while
    financial assistance should be provided for more research about NbS to be undertaken
    by African researchers to supplement the studies already conducted in developed
    countries. One consistent observation within the studies mentioned above is the
    need for more studies about NbS within the African continent. Moreover, it can
    be observed that the existing studies have been focused on using NbS to solve
    specific issues such as flood risk and water management, urban spaces, and informal
    settlements, among others. It has become necessary to view NbS studies from a
    wider perspective to identify crucial, unexplored areas and to set the direction
    for more NbS studies within the African continent. Moreover, in the wake of the
    realisation in diverse countries globally that nature offers solutions to age-long
    problems of mankind, and that using nature-inspired initiatives would lead to
    more sustainable benefits, it is timely to make a case for NbS for a sustainable
    built environment as a way of mitigating the effects of adverse climatic changes
    on construction infrastructure within the African continent. To this end, NbS
    studies were analysed in this study, using a sciento-metric approach, to determine
    scholarly connections, performance and trends within these studies. Furthermore,
    in this study, through network visualisation and a narrative review, a future
    direction is delineated for NbS research within the built environment in African
    countries and other developing countries where such studies are deficient. It
    was believed that the outcomes of the study would create a clear line of focus
    for forward-looking research in the deployment of NbS to enhance built environment
    projects undertaken within developing nations, particularly in Africa. Moreover,
    the findings could serve as an excellent platform for wider debate and directing
    future NbS studies in the built environment. 2 OVERVIEW OF NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS
    Since NbS gained prominence at the beginning of the 21st century, several definitions
    and descriptions of the concept have been proposed. NbS was defined by the United
    Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA, 2020) as encompassing actions that address
    social, economic and environmental challenges effectively and adaptively while,
    simultaneously, protecting, conserving, restoring and sustainably managing natural
    or modified terrestrial, freshwater, coastal and marine ecosystems. These actions
    provide benefits for human well-being, ecosystem services, resilience and biodiversity
    (UNEA, 2020). The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN, 2020)
    described NbS as an innovative approach towards conserving nature while protecting,
    managing and restoring the environment and, in the process, delivering benefits
    that are tangible and sustainable for the people. The Federal Emergency Management
    Agency (FEMA) characterised NbS as sustainable planning, design, environmental
    management and engineering practices that integrate natural features or processes
    into the built environment to foster adaptation and resilience (FEMA, 2021). According
    to Kalantari et al. (2018), NbS is notable for its adaptive nature, enabling its
    use to be of benefit to both human welfare and biodiversity conservation simultaneously.
    NbS also embodies the fusion of human innovation with the inherent resilience
    and functions of ecosystems. According to this philosophy, it is recognised that
    ecosystems, from forests and wetlands to coastal areas and urban green spaces,
    provide services that are crucial for sustaining life on earth (Goodwin et al.,
    2023). From purifying air and water to regulating climate and supporting pollinators,
    these services underscore the vital link between humanity and the natural world
    (Kalantari et al., 2018). By leveraging these attributes of ecosystems, NbS exemplify
    an approach that harmonises human needs with ecological imperatives. According
    to Pereira et al. (2023), NbS can be understood as strategies that harmonise human
    development and environmental conservation through the strategic integration of
    nature. These strategies encompass diverse practices, from enhancing natural infrastructure,
    such as wetlands and forests, to integrating green spaces within urban environments.
    Van Rees et al. (2023) added that the essence of NbS lies in recognising that
    nature is not merely a resource to be exploited, but a foundation upon which sustainable
    and resilient societies can be built. By working with, rather than against, nature,
    these solutions engender long-term benefits for both people and the ecosystems
    that support them. Also, different examples and applications of NbS have been
    noted in past studies. These include: marshes, dunes and reefs that protect coastal
    property and infrastructure against storms and chronic erosion (Jordan & Fröhle,
    2022); forests and wetlands that store floodwaters, provide wildlife habitat and
    filter water for downstream communities (Hovis et al., 2021); and natural spaces
    that improve water and air quality, reduce urban heat, store carbon and provide
    health benefits in urban environments (Hayes et al., 2022). NbS also enhance the
    resilience of built and natural systems in a changing environment (e.g., increasing
    weather and climate extremes). Unlike conventional “grey” infrastructure that
    is static in the environment and designed to optimise a narrow set of functions
    and conditions (Sun et al., 2020), natural infrastructure systems can recover
    from extreme events, self-adjust to on-going environmental changes and continuously
    deliver a wide range of social and economic benefits (Jordan & Fröhle, 2022).
    Evidence also indicates that NbS can be equally as cost-effective as conventional
    approaches, or more so, particularly considering the life-cycle costs of projects
    (Lafortezza et al., 2018). 3 METHODOLOGY An interpretivist philosophical stance
    was adopted for the study, using a sciento-metric and narrative review of existing
    studies, with the unit of analysis being each publication. This approach is inductive
    and rooted in the grounded theory strategy and longitudinal time horizon. The
    paucity of works on NbS within the built environment, particularly in the African
    context, necessitated this approach, which has gained considerable interest in
    other aspects of built-environment research. From an operational perspective,
    Figure 1 illustrates the specific details of the sciento-metric review conducted.
    The sciento-metric review (a branch of biblio-metrics) is a quantitative approach
    to text-mining scientific publications. It is a computer-assisted approach to
    reviewing the available body of knowledge to examine core research or authors
    and their relationship within a given research field (De Bellis, 2009). Also,
    a sciento-metric review provides a visual perspective of the structural and dynamic
    aspects of existing scientific research contained within a body of knowledge (Olawumi
    & Chan, 2018). Sciento-metric review offers the opportunity to identify leading
    contributors (authors, countries, funding bodies, sources) through performance
    analysis, to examine impactful contributions (citations, co-authorships, bibliographic
    coupling) and their areas of focus and trends through scientific mapping and network
    visualisations (Donthu et al., 2021). Furthermore, this approach enables researchers
    to identify systematic, literature-related discoveries that might be overlooked
    in manual review studies (Zhong et al., 2019). Thus, a sciento-metric review was
    adopted to understand the concept of NbS further from the perspective of past
    studies and create a clear direction for future studies within the built environment.
    Based on the sciento-metric analysis conducted, a narrative review was further
    considered to be necessary to highlight the core discussions from the identified
    NbS studies that were extracted. The narrative review entailed summarising different
    primary studies and drawing conclusions from a holistic viewpoint. These conclusions
    were shaped mostly by the experience of the researcher and the existing theories
    (Dinther et al., 2011). FIGURE 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Outline of the
    research framework. In conducting the review, the database for bibliographic data
    extraction and the ideal key terms for data search were first determined. The
    Scopus database was selected because it has attracted significant attention among
    researchers in the field of science. Moreover, the database overlaps considerably
    with other databases, such as Web of Science (Aghimien et al., 2020; Guz & Rushchitsky,
    2009). Also, selecting the optimal search terms is crucial to the reliability
    of the outcomes of sciento-metric reviews (Chen & Xiao, 2016). As a result, three
    common ways of writing “NbS” in the studies reviewed in the preliminary investigation
    were used to search titles, abstracts and keywords, using two major Boolean operators
    (“OR” and “AND”). The search protocol used to gather bibliographic data included:
    Title-Abstract-Keywords: “Nature-based solutions” OR “Nature-base solutions” OR
    “Nature base solution” published in the last 10 years (i.e., 2013 to 2023). The
    selected 10-year period was based on the need for recency in the extracted data.
    This initial search revealed 3174 documents across diverse fields of study. The
    next step was to refine the search to gather documents that were related to the
    built environment. In doing this, the subject area was limited to Engineering
    to gather documents that were more specific to the built environment, while the
    document type was restricted to journals and conferences. These two document types
    were selected based on past submissions that they both have higher rigour in their
    review process (Aghimien et al., 2020; Zheng et al., 2016). The language of publication
    was also set to English, as this is the preferred language of most journals. Based
    on these refined parameters, 358 documents were found, and their bibliographic
    data were downloaded onto a comma-separated values (CSV) file and a Bibtex format
    for further review. The downloaded CSV file was cleaned manually to ensure no
    overlaps or missing information before proceeding with the data analyses. This
    approach produced usable bibliographic data for 355 publications (323 journal
    articles and 32 conference papers). The analyses of the extracted bibliographic
    data were conducted using Microsoft Excel, R-Studio and the visualisation of Similarities
    Viewer Software (VOSviewer). To understand the area of focus of these extracted
    documents and the trends in these research studies, a visualisation of the mapped
    keywords in the documents was conducted using VOSviewer Software. Also, Bibliometrix
    in R-Studio was used to determine the word frequency and to create a word cloud
    of the significant keywords from the extracted documents. Based on the analysis
    conducted, the results were presented in terms of the performance analysis (year,
    country, sources), scientific mapping (top-cited documents), and network analysis
    (network visualisation). The narrative review was employed to present the core
    information in the different areas discovered from the network analysis based
    on the extracted data. 4 FINDINGS AND DISCUSSIONS 4.1 Performance analysis of
    NbS studies 4.1.1 Documents per year To understand the interest attracted to this
    area of research, the documents per year were evaluated. The results shown in
    Figure 2 revealed that no documents were extracted for the years 2013 and 2015,
    with only one for 2014. However, since 2016, there has been a steady increase
    in the number of publications in this area of research. A surge of publications
    occurred in 2019, with 21 documents compared were the eight documents published
    in 2018. There has been significant interest in this area of study during the
    period from 2020 to 2023. There was a reduced number of publications (n = 78)
    in 2023 compared with the year 2022 (n = 110) because the search was conducted
    in August 2023. It was possible that more papers were published before the end
    of the year. Figure 2 also shows the average total citations (TC) per article
    in each year. The line graph shows that the highest average TC per article of
    110 and 125.5, was recorded in 2016 and 2017, respectively. It was not surprising
    to see fewer average TC per article for publications during the period 2018 to
    2023. The average TC per article in these years will increase as forthcoming publications
    cite these documents. FIGURE 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Publication per
    year. 4.1.2 Documents per sources The extracted documents originated from 96 sources.
    Table 1 shows the top10 most relevant sources. It is immediately evident from
    the table that all top sources were journal outlets, with the first set of articles
    published in 2016. This could be attributed to the earlier observation of there
    being more journal articles (n = 323) compared with conference papers (n = 32).
    This implied that more conference gatherings might be needed to promote further
    awareness of NbS, especially among built environment experts. The result in the
    table showed that the journal, Sustainability, published as an open-access journal
    of MDPI, had the highest number of published documents (n = 83), followed by the
    Journal of Cleaner Production (n = 36) published by Elsevier. A careful review
    of the scope of these journals showed that they both encourage original research
    in sustainability and the environment. Thus, it was reasonable to find more papers
    about NbS being published by these journal outlets. This further reinforced a
    strong relationship between NbS and a sustainable built environment. Further scrutiny
    of the most relevant sources based on their citation counts and Hirsch index (h-index)
    revealed that the Journal of Cleaner Production (h-index = 17; TC = 1804), Sustainability
    (h-index = 11; TC = 501), and Sustainable Cities and Society (h-index = 10; TC = 335)
    had the highest impact measure. An interesting observation was that, despite having
    fewer publications than the Sustainability journal, the Journal of Cleaner Production
    had the highest number of citations. This implied the possibility of the latter
    journal reaching a much wider audience than others. The high impact factor of
    the Journal of Cleaner Production, when compared with others, could be another
    indicator for researchers to rely on its output. It is important to note that
    the h-index presented in this case was based on the impact of the extracted documents.
    This h-index shows the number of NbS articles (h) published by these journals,
    which have been cited in other papers at least h times. Also, the m-index shows
    the h-index divided by the number of years since the first NbS-related publication
    by the source. This result showed that, for NbS studies relating to sustainable
    and resilient infrastructure, the sources identified would be the best references
    for researchers. TABLE 1. Top ten sources. Sources 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021

    countries from where these studies about NbS came, and also to identify countries
    in which the findings of this research could be most useful, the contributions
    per country were assessed. Since it was difficult to distinguish the specific
    country in which some of the extracted studies were conducted because of cross-country
    and continent collaborations among authors, the countries of the corresponding
    authors were explored to gain insight into where the studies were conducted. The
    extracted documents came from 51 countries, and 18 of these countries produced
    only 1 document. It was possible that these were once-off collaborations. To be
    certain that a country has contributed to the existing NbS discourse, Table 2
    shows the results for countries with a minimum threshold of five documents. At
    the top of the list were: China (n = 39, TC = 377), Italy (n = 29, TC = 328),
    United Kingdom (n = 25, TC = 182), Spain (n = 22, TC = 272), and USA (n = 20,
    TC = 68). An interesting outcome of this result was the contribution of African
    countries to the larger NbS discourse in the built environment. The result showed
    that only four African countries (i.e., Algeria, Egypt, Kenya, and South Africa)
    had authors who had researched and published studies about NbS, which had been
    indexed in the Engineering section of Scopus. In past studies, South Africa and
    Kenya were also noted as major contributors to the NbS discourse (Enu et al.,
    2023; Nykia & Dinka, 2022). It is emphasised that, while other studies from the
    African continent might exist, the country of affiliation of the corresponding
    authors might not have been within the African continent, as in the case of many
    of the extracted documents. This might have affected the number of African countries,
    which was evident in the result presented. TABLE 2. Countries of publications.

    the details of collaborations. For each country identified, the number of documents
    with at least one co-author from a different country is indicated by the figure
    for multiple countries publication (MCP). On the other hand, the single country
    of publication (SCP) shows the number of documents that were published by the
    author(s) from just one country. Thus, the result in the table shows that all
    the countries identified had at least one publication that someone from a different
    country co-authored. Leading this pool of collaborators were China, Italy and
    the United Kingdom. The MCP ratio indicates the strength of international collaboration.
    The closer the ratio is to 1, the higher the international collaboration of the
    country (Aria & Cuccurullo, 2017). Considering the figures in the MCP-ratio column,
    it could be concluded that Ireland, Portugal, China and the United Kingdom were
    among the highest international collaborating countries. However, countries such
    as the USA, Poland, Canada, and India could broaden their research activities
    through international collaborations. Further analysis illustrated in Figure 3
    showed the co-authorship relationship between these countries. The Figure shows
    that the United Kingdom, which had a total link strength (TLS) of 81, strongly
    collaborated with Italy, Germany, France, Greece and Ireland. With a high TLS
    of 52, the USA had a strong co-authoring relationship with China, Australia, Switzerland,
    Austria, India, Canada, Denmark and the United Arab Emirates. A co-authoring relationship
    was also evident between Spain, Netherlands, Portugal and Belgium and between
    Norway, Poland, Sweden, Hungary and Brazil. These results further reinforced the
    need for this current study and the opportunity for researchers to contribute
    to the NbS discourse from an African perspective through international collaboration.
    FIGURE 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Co-authorship per country. 4.1.4 Contributing
    authors Regarding the contributing authors, the extracted documents had 1354 authors,
    while only 20 documents had single authorship. Wang, Y. had the highest number
    of documents (n = 5) with TC of 39 and h-index of 4. The first NbS-related paper
    by this author was published in 2017. Also prominent in terms of number of publications
    were Bouma, T.J. (n = 4, TC = 58, h-index = 3), Liu, J. (n = 4, TC = 84, h-index = 3),
    Schüttrumpf, H. (n = 4, TC = 24, h-index = 3), and Feng, Z. (n = 4, TC = 26, h-index = 2).
    Figure 4 shows a three-field plot of the countries, authors and sources. The statistics
    show a strong link between the most published countries, authors and sources.
    FIGURE 4 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Three-field plot of authors, countries
    and sources. 4.2 Scientometric mapping of NbS studies 4.2.1 Most cited documents
    The citation count of an author or document is regarded as the biblio-metric performance
    of the document or author and their impact on their field of study (Hirsch, 2005).
    Thus, the result in Table 3 shows the top cited documents (i.e., documents with
    at least 50 citations), their TC, TC per year, and normalised TC. While some of
    these documents were mostly about NbS, related areas were addressed in others,
    such as green infrastructure, green economy, circular economy, urban planning,
    and policy, among others, with NbS being mentioned as either part of their keywords
    or in their abstracts. Studies with a core focus on NbS as part of their titles
    were reported by Fink (2016), La Rosa and Pappalardo (2020), Magliocchetti et
    al. (2021), Pontee et al. (2016), Ren et al. (2019) and Wamsler et al. (2020).
    These top-cited papers (n = 14) had accumulated 1838 citations with an average
    TC per year of 24.4. The work of D''amato et al. (2017), in which circular economy,
    green economy and bio-economy were compared, was top of the list. These three
    aspects of sustainability were compared and contrasted to promote the concepts
    of sustainability. It was discovered that, for issues related to environmental
    sustainability, a green economy could be an over-arching concept that encompasses
    elements of circular and bio-economy and other ideas, such as NbS. This document
    accumulated 525 citations. A review of the green economy and its related concepts,
    done by Loiseau et al. (2016), also gained 362 citations. In the study, the major
    theories and concepts relating to green economy were identified and described.
    In so doing, the purpose of the study was to contribute to the definitions and
    relationships of concepts related to green economy, as a condition for operationalising
    green economy. An interesting observation from the result shown in Table 3 is
    the methodology adopted by these past studies. The result indicates an opportunity
    for methodological contribution by built environment researchers with a focus
    on more quantitative methods to provide empirical evidence about NbS for sustainable
    built environments. TABLE 3. Most cited documents. Publication Title Source Focus

    order to determine the key areas of focus, first, the top-ten, most common terms
    from the extracted bibliographic data were identified, and a word cloud was created
    using the 50 most common terms, as shown in Figure 5. These terms were: climate
    change (f = 82), nature-based solution (f = 50), sustainable development (f = 44),
    sustainability (f = 40), urban planning (f = 32), ecosystems (f = 30), urban area
    (f = 28), water management (f = 28), floods (f = 27), decision-making (f = 25).
    These common terms gave an idea of the area of concentration of the extracted
    NbS-related studies. FIGURE 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Word cloud of most
    common keywords. To map the research focus of the extracted publications further,
    VOSviewer was adopted. All the extracted documents revealed 3256 keywords used
    by authors and journals during indexing. Using VOSviewer helped to group this
    large number of keywords into more coherent clusters, using a set co-occurrence
    threshold. Since there is no rule regarding the minimum threshold to be used (Aghimien
    et al., 2022), a minimum co-occurrence threshold was set at eight, as this gave
    the best clarity and optimisation of the visualisation map as suggested by Darko
    et al. (2020). Based on the set threshold, 78 keywords co-occurred eight times,
    and these were grouped into five clusters with a TLS of 3382 and 1376 links, as
    shown in Figure 6. FIGURE 6 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Network visualisation
    of co-occurring keywords in NbS-related publications. Cluster 1, arbitrarily named
    NbS for flood control, can be seen in the red nodes. This cluster had 20 co-occurring
    keywords. Among these keywords were: flood, flood control, flooding, flood risk
    management, runoff, storms, coastal protection, coastal engineering, risk assessment,
    risk perception, and sea level. Based on the latent similarities of these keywords,
    this cluster was named NbS for flood control. NbS in combating natural disasters,
    such as floods, has been highlighted in various studies. Thaler et al. (2023)
    explored natural flood management to support sustainable flood risk management.
    It was noted that this approach impacted physical conditions, social interaction,
    financial resources and institutional settings. Also, Van Hespen et al. (2023)
    assessed the role of mangrove forests as NbS in protecting coastal areas from
    floods. It was noted that using NbS for protection from coastal flooding could
    be both sustainable and cost-effective. Reaney (2022) explored spatial targeting
    of NbS for managing flood risk in river catchments and observed that most NbS
    for reducing flood hazard were designed to store and slow the flow within catchments.
    For these NbS to be effective as designed, it was necessary to identify the optimal
    locations for implementing them. Also, Basu et al. (2021) proposed a theoretical
    framework that could be used to assess the performance of green roofs as NbS for
    mitigating flooding within urban areas. It was stated that climate change, poor
    soil permeability and infiltration caused by rapid urbanisation had made many
    cities susceptible to flooding. Pontee et al. (2016) explored the lessons learnt
    from NbS applications worldwide, particularly concerning coastal floods and erosion
    risks. It was observed that, although created or enhanced by man, NbS adopted
    tended to mimic the characteristics of natural features (hence the name). These
    solutions include beaches, dunes, salt-marshes, mangroves, and sea grasses, among
    others, and were designed either to control or to reduce erosion and flooding.
    As noted earlier, NbS studies from within Africa have also placed emphasis on
    the use of this concept to combat flood risk, which has become prevalent in the
    continent (Enu et al., 2023; Kalantari et al., 2018; Lokidor et al., 2023). From
    the perspective of building resilient cities, Mabrouk et al. (2023) explored the
    use of NbS in urban planning in Egypt. Based on the study, it was found that the
    use of NbS strategies, such as low-impact development tools, could be very effective
    in reducing flood run-off. In Ghana, Yiwo et al. (2022) also noted the need for
    the use of NbS to build flood resilience and effectively manage flood risk. Considering
    the studies mentioned above, in which flood risk management, mangrove forests
    as NbS, spatial assessment of river catchments as NbS, and green roof construction
    as NbS for reducing flooding were explored, it was evident that NbS played a crucial
    role in the reduction and management of flood risk. Cluster 2, arbitrarily named
    NbS in climate change and urban planning, is indicated within the green nodes
    (Figure 6) and had 19 keywords. Among these keywords were: nature-based solution,
    climate change, climate change adaptation, urban planning, urban growth, urban
    design, urban development, adaptation, adaptive management, and resilience, among
    others. This cluster was subsequently named NbS in climate change and urban development.
    Zikhathile et al. (2023) noted that the effect of climate change on earth''s sustainability
    is devastating, and this has become a growing concern for countries worldwide.
    Ensuring effective planning, particularly in urban areas that are susceptible
    to the adverse effects of climate change, has become critical. Pancewicz et al.
    (2023), in an effort to strengthen the resilience of cities to climate change,
    explored the use of NbS within local communities in Poland. It was noted that,
    while cities within the country were introducing sustainable urban lifestyles
    through NbS, the full potential of the opportunities presented by these solutions
    were not being utilised. Similarly, Małecka-ziembińska and Janicka (2022) submitted
    that NbS was one of the recent means of addressing climate change through the
    use of the power of nature to combat the emissions of greenhouse gases. However,
    NbS had not gained much attention in Polish municipalities because of the poor
    awareness and knowledge of the concept, and this necessitated the need for effective
    education about this aspect of addressing climate change in the country. Wamsler
    et al. (2020) viewed NbS and climate change adaptation from the perspective of
    the environment and climate policy. How nature-based approaches were integrated
    into the planning and governance of municipalities in Sweden to address climate
    change adaptation was examined in the study. It was noted that critical planning
    for nature-based adaptation could be challenging, as this process requires trans-disciplinary
    approaches with interaction among various stakeholders. However, five strategies
    for overcoming this challenging process were proposed, namely: “targeted stakeholder
    collaboration; strategic citizen involvement; alteration of internal co-operation
    structures; outsourcing; and concealed science policy integration” (Wamsler et
    al., 2020: 3). In South Africa, Knight (2023) explored NbS in building coastal
    resilience. It was noted that coastal landforms are green infrastructure that
    could reduce the impact of climate change, while providing environmental services
    as intended. Within the railway sector, Blackwood and Renaud (2022) explored the
    challenges in the use of NbS for adaptation to climate change. It was observed
    that lack of evidence, safety issues, constraints on land-use, constraints on
    time, stakeholder dependencies, uncertainty in climate changes, and limited cost–benefit
    analysis were all key challenges. Evidently, NbS offered solutions to address
    issues of climate change, and planning was essential if these solutions were to
    be incorporated into cities and societies effectively. Małecka-ziembińska and
    Janicka (2022) mentioned earlier that the green benefits offered by NbS, which
    could address the issue of climate change, should be standard in planning of land-use,
    particularly in the current human-centred era. Cluster 3, arbitrarily named NbS
    in water quality and carbon emission, is presented in the blue nodes (Figure 6)
    and had 16 keywords. Among these keywords, were: nature-based solution, water
    quality, water treatment, waste-water treatment, water management, wetlands, constructed
    wetlands, ecosystem, ecology, blue carbon, carbon, and carbon sequestration. This
    cluster was subsequently named NbS in water quality and carbon emission. Tsatsou
    et al. (2023) noted that urban centres are faced with the challenges of water
    management and scarcity. This has necessitated the need for water circularity
    and NbS in urban areas. To this end, a circular water NbS was proposed, including
    green roofing, living walls, indoor plants, permeable paving, rain-garden and
    bio-swale. To improve water delivery, particularly in urban areas, Bogatinoska
    et al. (2022) noted that a participatory approach that enables all stakeholders
    to congregate and share ideas was crucial. However, diverse participatory methods
    have been used in designing NbS together with stakeholders. Thus, a step-wise,
    participatory framework, applied in four countries (Netherlands, Belgium, France,
    and United Kingdom), was proposed in the study. In Portugal, Freitas et al. (2021)
    adopted a multi-disciplinary approach in assessing NbS for water delivery in urban
    areas. It was observed that old, underground structures, such as ancestral networks
    of water sources and springs, could benefit socio-economic, environmental and
    heritage drivers of water delivery. Muñoz Veloza et al. (2022) explored two NbS,
    that is, blue-green roofs and rain gardens, as means of increasing water availability
    in informal settlements, while mitigating climate change in the process. Using
    recycled materials, prototypes for these two NbS were built in El Pozón, Colombia,
    and were observed to improve indoor thermal comfort, while enabling easy storage
    of rainwater for domestic use and cultivation of affordable food for people in
    private gardens. Based on the study, it was concluded that NbS could be a method
    for dwellers in informal settlements to tackle the effects of global warming.
    Also, Acreman et al. (2021), using a systematic review, showed that the use of
    NbS had the capability to improve water quality in Africa and to address the water
    shortage in some parts of the continent. Xiao et al. (2023) also explored NbS
    as a means for attaining carbon neutrality in resilient buildings and communities.
    This became necessary because the building industry has been noted as being a
    principal culprit of carbon emissions, accounting for almost 40% of CO2 emissions
    globally. It was noted that using NbS, such as urban trees, green roofs and facades,
    which are urban green infrastructures, could be a viable means of addressing this
    negative impact of the building industry on the environment. Similarly, Xi et
    al. (2022) noted that NbS could prove to be effective in regulating urban ecosystems,
    particularly through increased green infrastructure. In Canada, Grossi et al.
    (2023) noted that urban trees absorb CO2 emissions through the process of photosynthesis.
    Furthermore, in the study, several parameters for carbon neutrality through sequestration
    of tree emissions were presented. Similarly, Xi et al. (2023) noted that transportation
    was a principal contributor to urban heat islands and heat waves, which could
    increase urban carbon emissions. However, these problems could be addressed through
    the effective use of NbS, such as roadside green belts, which tend to block traffic-related
    pollutants. In South Africa, Raw et al. (2023) explored the need for restoration
    to enhance carbon sequestration. It was noted that blue carbon systems, including
    mangroves, sea-grasses and salt marshes, could help to mitigate the impact of
    climate change because of their efficiency in sequestering CO2 within the atmosphere.
    Similarly, Masisi et al. (2022) explored bamboo as an NbS in combating climate
    change in Tanzania. The use of bamboo was explored because it is a versatile,
    woody grass that can survive in degraded lands. It was concluded that bamboo “can
    produce a tradable amount of carbon under carbon off-setting schemes and serve
    as an effective strategy for forest landscape restoration opportunities” (Masisi
    et al., 2022: 8). The studies mentioned above all indicate the immense usefulness
    of NbS in attaining net zero carbon emission and improving the delivery of high-quality
    water. Cluster 4, arbitrarily named NbS for sustainable development, is shown
    in the yellow nodes (Figure 6), with 11 keywords. These keywords included: sustainability,
    sustainable development, circular economy, economic and social effects, life-cycle,
    urban sustainability, sustainable development goal, decision-making, urban agriculture,
    and economics. This cluster was subsequently named NbS for sustainable development.
    Neumann and Hack (2020) noted earlier that NbS were designed to achieve sustainability
    through attaining economic, social, and environmental benefits. Ommer et al. (2022)
    stated that the use of NbS had gained popularity because of its ability to provide
    some co-benefits in terms of economy, society and the environment. In support,
    Ramísio et al. (2022) submitted that NbS takes into consideration the wellbeing
    of people, the growth of socio-economic indicators and rules of governance. Thus,
    introducing NbS into urban infrastructure development created a fresh perspective
    on urban sustainability, quality of life, and adaptation to climate change. Fink
    (2016) noted that using NbS, such as green infrastructure, which is a cost-effective
    approach to improving adaptation to climate changes and promoting human well-being,
    can be effective in promoting sustainability within societies. Considering the
    economic dimension of sustainability, Loiseau et al. (2016) explored green economy
    to identify major theories and concepts relating to green economy. Based on the
    study, it was found that NbS, among other frameworks, was closely related to the
    attainment of a green economy. Di Cosola et al. (2021) explored NbS and renewable
    energies in achieving the agenda of the UN''s SDGs in a quest for urban transition.
    It was noted that urban centres had become synonymous with issues of unsustainability
    such as air pollution, resource consumption and inequality. Thus, introducing
    nature-based technologies that could help to transform these urban centres and
    attain sustainable development was essential. Another essential study was the
    work of Keesstra et al. (2023), in which NbS was explored as an opportunity to
    attain sustainable food systems in societies. Food production was noted to be
    germane to societal well-being and ecological sustainability. To this end, three
    types of NbS were observed in the study, namely: intrinsic NbS, which adopts existing
    ecosystems; hybrid NbS, which adapts ecosystems; and inspired NbS, consisting
    of totally new ecosystems. The use of inspired NbS was observed to have the highest
    impact on the attainment of sustainable food production. Considering the impact
    of NbS on environmental, societal and economic development, it was evident that
    careful attention given to solutions drawn from nature could be a positive step
    towards achieving the SDGs in countries worldwide. Cluster 5, arbitrarily named,
    NbS in green infrastructure and urbanisation, is shown in the purple nodes (Figure
    6), with 11 keywords. These keywords included: green infrastructure, urban area,
    vegetation, green space, heat island, urban heat island, urbanisation, cooling,
    atmospheric temperature, and air quality. This cluster was subsequently named
    NbS in green infrastructure and urbanisation. Frantzeskaki et al. (2022) noted
    the importance of NbS for resilient infrastructure in cities. Also, Ronchi and
    Salata (2022) assessed the role of the design of urban space, using NbS in green
    infrastructure. The findings of the study conducted in Italy provided opportunities
    to define environmental policies and strategies that could prove to be effective
    in the design of urban space and in the decision-making process for the attainment
    of sustainable development goals. In proposing NbS as a viable option for addressing
    issues of climate change in Canada, Anderson and Gough (2022) focused on the regulatory
    environmental impact analysis of green infrastructure. Based on the study, it
    was noted that using NbS through green infrastructure offered an approach to achieving
    the country''s build-back better plan and localising the SDGs, while addressing
    the various impacts of climate change. Magliocchetti et al. (2021) attempted to
    restore landscape ecosystems that would benefit society significantly. To achieve
    this, the possibility of forecasting green and blue infrastructures through NbS
    to reduce the hydrological risk caused by climate change was explored in the study.
    Based on the study conducted in two small settlements in Argentina and Italy,
    a methodological tool was proposed that could assist in the identification of
    a wide range of possible interventions to mitigate these risks through territorial
    and urban planning of suitable “green and blue infrastructures” achieved through
    different uses of NbS. In view of these benefits of NbS for infrastructure and
    urban development, Bona et al. (2023) noted that a huge opportunity existed for
    NbS to be adopted in buildings and the built environment, but these were not prioritised
    because of a lack of effective monitoring of the potential successful outcomes
    of available NbS. 4.2.3 Visualisation of trends and direction for future studies
    in NbS research Figure 7 shows the thematic evolution of common terms within a
    three-year range. While terms, such as “coastal engineering”, “biodiversity” and
    “ecology”, were common between 2014 and 2018, “climate change”, “urban area”,
    “bio-engineering”, “floods”, “water management”, “cooling” and “environmental
    impact” were more prominent between 2019 and 2021. From 2022 to the present, NbS
    became more evident, together with risk assessment, bio-engineering, adaptive
    management and water quality. This showed that the term “NbS” has continued to
    gain prominence in recent studies. FIGURE 7 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Thematic
    evolution of common NbS-related terms. Figure 8 shows the visualisation map overlay
    derived from VOSviewer. This map shows the trend in the focus of research. The
    map shows only keywords that co-occurred eight times, beginning in 2020. Based
    on the map, and in affirmation of the results from the thematic evolution of common
    terms, it was evident that terms, such as “floods”, “ecosystems”, “water quality
    and management”, “climate change”, “urban area” and “planning”, were all prominent
    during the period from 2020 to 2021. However, since 2022, there has been more
    focus on: “nature-based solutions”, “adaptation”, “adaptive management”, “greenhouse
    gases”, “energy utilisation”, “carbon sequestration”, and “numerical models”.
    These keywords are shown in the yellow nodes of the map. FIGURE 8 Open in figure
    viewer PowerPoint Overlay visualisation of co-occurring keywords in NbS-related
    publications. It has been noted that the closer keywords are to each other, the
    higher their co-occurrence (Van Eck & Waltman, 2014). Thus, examining the occurrence
    and TLS of the keywords in the yellow nodes (i.e., the recent area of focus) showed
    which areas were receiving adequate attention and which could be researched further.
    Thus, areas such as adaptation and adaptive management (f = 8, TLS = 21), carbon
    sequestration (f = 8, TLS = 32), numeric models (f = 9, TLS = 29), energy utilisation
    (f = 9, TLS = 40), cooling (f = 9, TLS = 47) and greenhouse gases (f = 10, TLS = 43)
    were all current areas but with less attention. Therefore, the emphasis in future
    studies within the built environment domain, particularly in African countries
    where such studies are scant, could be placed on these research areas to achieve
    a sustainable built environment through NbS. For example, adaptive management,
    which entails making decisions and necessary changes in preparedness for future
    circumstances based on new information and changes (United States Agency for International
    Development, 2015) has not gained significant traction within the built environment.
    In construction, for instance, where projects are unique and dynamic, adaptive
    management could help to prepare and make reasonable decisions to address unforeseen
    issues that might result from the delivery of such projects. Exploring the deployment
    of NbS within the built environment from the perspective of adaptive management
    could serve as a much-needed solution towards addressing unexpected problems that
    are common in construction projects. Also, Hutton (2021) noted that carbon sequestration
    can assist in transforming buildings from net-negative to net-positive structures.
    Carbon sequestration entails capturing and storing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere
    with the aim of reducing climate change. The built environment has continued to
    be identified in studies as a principal culprit of greenhouse gas emissions through
    day-to-day use of energy for lighting, heating and cooling, as well as the use
    of energy in material manufacturing, transportation and construction (Budds, 2019).
    This has made this industry unsustainable in many countries around the world.
    As the African continent begins to grasp the issue of climate change and several
    agendas for adapting and mitigating its adverse effects (Dupar et al., 2023),
    future studies, therefore, could be undertaken within African countries to explore
    how the implementation of NbS from the onset could help to address issues of greenhouse
    gas emission, promote energy usage and carbon sequestration to achieve carbon
    neutrality within buildings and society as a whole. This was important because
    the findings of the review conducted showed only two studies (Masisi et al., 2022;
    Raw et al., 2023) from within Africa, in which carbon sequestration was explored
    from the perspective of NbS. Furthermore, since the concept of NbS fairly new
    within the built environment, researchers could focus on developing and refining
    numerical models that could provide accurate predictions of the performance of
    NbS implementations. These models could contribute to a better understanding of
    how NbS interacts with various sustainability factors. This understanding, in
    turn, would enable informed decision-making and the formulation of more effective
    strategies to enhance resilience against climate risks in African countries and
    beyond. 4.3 Implication of the findings The findings of the review of extant literature
    showed a lack of adequate research about NbS within the built environment in Africa.
    In previous NbS-related studies within the continent, the need has also emphasised
    for more studies that will lead to the improved use of this beneficial concept
    and to supplement findings from studies already conducted in other developed countries
    (Lokidor et al., 2023; Nykia & Dinka, 2022). Thus, by exploring past studies from
    a global perspective, the findings of the current study offer researchers within
    the African continent other areas that can be explored with a view to promoting
    the NbS discourse and contributing significantly to the attainment of a sustainable
    built environment. Also, the results showed that there were limited international
    collaborations on NbS research from an African perspective, as developed countries
    tend to collaborate with each other to a greater extent. This reflected the limited
    awareness of NbS on the African continent. To address this trend, there is a need
    for researchers to enhance collaborations with other scholars globally to share
    ideas, research techniques and cultural orientations regarding the ways in which
    NbS could be deployed. Through effective collaborations, researchers and scholars
    on the continent could leverage the distributed intelligence of other leading
    scholars on best practices and current trends of NbS in addressing global issues.
    Another approach to promote NbS research in Africa would be to arrange more NbS-related
    conferences, workshops, technical working groups, symposiums and seminars constantly
    to increase the scholarly and practical discussions about ways to maximise the
    potential of natural systems to address climate change and other major challenges.
    Through these events, African scholars would be presented with opportunities to
    network with leading professionals from academia and practising professionals,
    which could encourage the widespread adoption of NbS knowledge at a continental
    level in addressing environmental, social and economic challenges. Moreover, these
    opportunities would provide built environment professionals, decision-makers and
    communities with information on how and where to apply NbS and measure their numerous
    benefits. Figure 9 shows a summary of the focus of NbS research and suggestions
    for future studies. By exploring the concept of NbS in the context of the built
    environment, from a global perspective, several implications could be drawn from
    the various clusters of keywords identified from past studies. In the first focus
    area of research, where NbS for flood control was examined, the potential of incorporating
    natural features, such as mangrove forests and green roofs, into flood risk management
    was emphasised. Considering the continuous issue of flooding that has afflicted
    some African countries, exploring NbS for effective flood management is crucial.
    While several studies in Africa have focused on NbS for flood risk management,
    as evident in the first cluster presented, built environment experts should consider
    holistic management approaches that encompass physical conditions, social interactions,
    financial resources and institutional settings that can assist in effectively
    managing the envisaged risk associated with flooding and its impact on built infrastructure.
    The second focus area of research identified, which entailed climate change and
    urban planning, underscored the role of NbS in fostering resilient urbanisation.
    Evidently, African countries face similar problems to the rest of the world in
    terms of adverse climatic changes. Therefore, there is a need for decision-makers,
    policymakers, and urban planners to prioritise the integration of NbS strategies
    to enhance the capacity of cities to adapt to the impacts of climate. Nykia and
    Dinka (2022) noted the need to overhaul institutions and policies to use NbS effectively
    within African cities. Moreover, the alignment of sustainability goals with urban
    infrastructure signified the potential for NbS to shape urban landscapes that
    promote ecological and human well-being. FIGURE 9 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Summary of NbS research focus and suggestions for future studies. In the third
    focus area of research, the potential use of NbS to improve urban water systems
    and mitigate carbon emissions by integrating natural systems, such as constructed
    wetlands and urban trees, was highlighted. This reinforced the need to make the
    transition towards more ecologically conscious and sustainable urban development
    paradigms within the built environment. With the water shortage and drought being
    persistent issues among many African countries (UNICEF, 2023), designs, methods
    and technologies that are aligned with nature cannot be overlooked. Practitioners
    and stakeholders involved in the delivery of water infrastructure in these countries
    could draw firstly from the opportunities in nature to address their water-related
    problems even before seeking assistance from other approaches. These could include
    encouraging the construction of blue-green roofs, living walls, indoor plants,
    and permeable paving, among others, as observed by Tsatsou et al. (2023). The
    fourth focus area of research (i.e., sustainable development) underscored the
    triple bottom-line benefits of NbS. The integration of economic, social and environmental
    co-benefits suggested that urban development strategies in Africa should prioritise
    NbS to achieve sustainable and inclusive growth. The fifth focus area of research,
    in which the potential use of NbS to mitigate urban heat effects and improve air
    quality was highlighted, implied that built environment practitioners could prioritise
    the integration of green infrastructure and vegetated spaces to counteract heat
    island effects and enhance urban liveability. The importance of green infrastructure
    in the African continent is gradually gaining recognition, with priority being
    given to this type of infrastructure by African leaders with a focus on achieving
    zero land degradation and restoring catchment and coastal ecosystems (Dupar et
    al., 2023). Thus, built environment experts involved in delivering infrastructure
    must also prioritise green properties. The emergence of these five focus areas
    of research underlined the inter-disciplinary nature of existing research about
    NbS. Thus, to realise the potential of NbS adequately in the built environment
    in Africa, there is a need for effective and efficient collaboration among ecologists,
    engineers, policymakers, sociologists, urban planners and other relevant stakeholders.
    These cross-disciplinary collaborations could foster innovative approaches that
    address the complex challenges faced by urban environments holistically. This
    is essential, as the importance of a participatory and multidisciplinary approach
    in developing appropriate NbS to effectively address key climatic and ecological
    issues has been noted in past studies (Bogatinoska et al., 2022; Freitas et al.,
    2021). The implication of these findings was that researchers seeking to make
    more meaningful contributions to the existing discourse about NbS for a sustainable
    built environment in Africa would benefit more from a cross-disciplinary research
    approach. Furthermore, these five areas of research offer the opportunity to consolidate
    knowledge and its effective transfer. Educational initiatives targeted at communities,
    urban planners, local governments and other stakeholders within the built environment
    could be used to facilitate the dissemination of best practices and lessons learned
    from these different areas of research in past studies. These initiatives could
    greatly assist in bridging the gap between research outcomes and practical implementation.
    Also, these five areas of research, identified in this study, provide valuable
    insight into policy formulation and implementation. Policymakers and other stakeholders
    within the built environment could leverage the findings to devise targeted strategies
    that foster the incorporation of NbS within plans to adapt to climate, sustainability
    frameworks and urban planning regulations. In addition, the areas of research
    identified in this study provide a robust foundation for establishing long-term
    monitoring and evaluation mechanisms for NbS projects. By categorising projects
    according to their clusters, policymakers and researchers could assess the effectiveness
    and impact of different NbS interventions over time, refining strategies and maximising
    potential outcomes. 5 CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS The current issues afflicting
    the African continent, such as devastating droughts, rising sea levels, population
    displacements, water scarcity, and changing weather patterns, among others, are
    expected to be exacerbated by climate change in the coming decades. With the population
    of the continent projected to increase by another billion people by 2050, the
    adoption of NbS could play a crucial role in mitigating the impacts of climate
    change. Additionally, NbS could contribute to strengthening communities, boosting
    local economies and ensuring the preservation of ecosystem services and biodiversity.
    This importance of NbS towards combating issues of climate change has led to an
    emerging popularity of the concept among researchers in both developed and developing
    countries. However, it has been noted that few studies about NbS have emerged
    within the African continent, and the need for financial support for researchers
    to explore this area has been noted. Thus, exploring existing NbS studies from
    a global perspective to provide direction for NbS research that is specific to
    Africa and to augment the existing studies emerging from the continent was deemed
    to be timely. Therefore, in this study, a case was made for NbS for a sustainable
    built environment in Africa by identifying scholarly connections, performance,
    and trends within past NbS studies and determining a future direction for research
    about NbS within the built environment in African countries. Based on the findings,
    it was concluded in this article that literature regarding the use of NbS within
    the built environment in Africa is scant, and there are limited external collaborations
    about NbS research from an African perspective. It was also concluded that the
    concepts of NbS have been explored from five major perspectives, namely: flood
    risk management; climate change and urban planning; water quality and carbon emission;
    sustainable development; and green infrastructure and urban development. These
    clusters offer opportunities for more contributions from researchers within the
    built environment in Africa. Significant contributions can be made to the existing
    NbS discourse by exploring NbS for sustainable built infrastructure in relation
    to any of these identified focus areas of research. Based on the trend in existing
    studies, it was also concluded that, in comparison with the other areas of research,
    less focus has been placed on carbon sequestration, greenhouse gases, energy utilisation,
    indoor comfort and numeric models for the use of NbS. Again, these areas offer
    opportunities for researchers within the built environment to contribute to NbS
    implementation in Africa. Practically, the findings of this study lead to key
    synergistic recommendations to help to scale up research and the deployment of
    NbS throughout the continent, and the need for aggressive action to deploy the
    concept cannot be over-stated. The acceptance and implementation of NbS require
    a collective approach because the government (federal, state and local), experts,
    partners and agencies, all have a role to play. Adequate knowledge and awareness
    of NbS created through research would create a future where natural infrastructure
    becomes the preferred option to combat climate change, build resilient infrastructure
    and create prosperous communities. Thus, there is a need for more financial support
    for researchers in the built environment who are willing to explore NbS within
    the African continent. Governments and research institutions in diverse African
    countries could champion this by prioritising and investing in research and development
    designed to improve the use of NbS. Similarly, built environment researchers should
    explore international collaboration to broaden their understanding of the concept
    of NbS and use this knowledge to explore their local context. To further promote
    NbS for a sustainable built environment, there is a need for more conferences,
    workshops, technical working groups, symposiums and seminars organised by organisations
    and institutions within the continent to explore NbS for local problems. These
    programmes would help grow the scholarly and practical discussions about ways
    to maximise NbS systems that would address the turbulent climate problems of the
    continent. Theoretically, this study provides a foundation upon which empirical
    studies can build to promote the knowledge and deployment of NbS in Africa. As
    a limitation, care must be taken in generalising the results of this study, as
    the data used were obtained solely from the Scopus database. Although significant
    commonalities exist between Scopus and other platforms, future studies could go
    further to deploy other databases to obtain a broader view of NbS research and
    provide direction for research about the built environment in Africa. Future studies
    could also combine several databases to compare results with this study, thus
    allowing inferences and theories to be drawn. Furthermore, the Scopus database
    is updated regularly, which means that the number of articles identified might
    increase when this article is published. REFERENCES Early View Online Version

  description: Water and industries are intangible units of the globe that are always
    set to meet the population's demand. The global population depends on one-third
    of freshwater increasing the demand. The increase in population along with urbanization
    has polluted the fresh water resources. The pharmaceutical industry is marked
    as an emerging contaminant of water pollution. The most common type of pharmaceutical
    drugs that are detected in the environment includes antibiotics, analgesics, NSAIDs,
    and pain-relieving drugs. These drugs alter the food chain of the organisms causing
    chaos mainly in the marine ecosystem. Pharmaceutical drugs are found only in shallow
    amounts (ng/mg) they have a huge impact on the living system. The consumption
    of water contaminated with pharmaceutical ingredients can disrupt reproduction,
    hormonal imbalance, cancer, and respiratory problems. Various methods are used
    to remove these chemicals from the environment. In this review, we mainly focused
    on the emerging hybrid technologies and their significance in the effective treatment
    of pharmaceutical wastewater. This review paper primarily elaborates on the merits
    and demerits of existing conventional technologies helpful in developing integrated
    technologies for the modern era of pharmaceutical effluent treatment. This review
    paper further in detail discusses the various strategies of eco-friendly bioremediation
    techniques namely biostimulation, bioaugmentation, bacterial degradation, mycoremediation,
    phytoremediation, and others for the ultimate removal of pharmaceutical contaminants
    in wastewater. The review makes clear that targeted and hybrid solutions are what
    the world will require in the future to get rid of these pharmacological prints.

  explanation: The paper focuses on closed-loop control and feedback mechanisms to
    ensure robust and reliable operation of automated irrigation systems in large-scale
    agriculture applications. These mechanisms are designed to monitor system performance,
    detect and respond to changes in environmental conditions, and make adjustments
    to optimize water usage. In particular, the study highlights the importance of
    real-time sensor data for effective control and decision-making within automated
    irrigation systems.
  extraction_1: The system employs a non-conventional mechanism for pharmaceutical
    pollutant removal (Li et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2021).
  extraction_2: Following the removal of biodegradable matter in the biological process
    within the reactor, the effluent undergoes additional purification by eliminating
    solutes through membrane filtration, resulting in the effluent of the desired
    quality.

    • Generation of major pollutants from the pharmaceutical industry and various
    industrial effluents. • Existing methods and their applications for the removal
    of pharmaceutical effluents. • Emerging hybrid technologies and their significance
    in the effective treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater. Abstract Water and industries
    are intangible units of the globe that are always set to meet the population''s
    demand. The global population depends on one-third of freshwater increasing the
    demand. The increase in population along with urbanization has polluted the fresh
    water resources. The pharmaceutical industry is marked as an emerging contaminant
    of water pollution. The most common type of pharmaceutical drugs that are detected
    in the environment includes antibiotics, analgesics, NSAIDs, and pain-relieving
    drugs. These drugs alter the food chain of the organisms causing chaos mainly
    in the marine ecosystem. Pharmaceutical drugs are found only in shallow amounts
    (ng/mg) they have a huge impact on the living system. The consumption of water
    contaminated with pharmaceutical ingredients can disrupt reproduction, hormonal
    imbalance, cancer, and respiratory problems. Various methods are used to remove
    these chemicals from the environment. In this review, we mainly focused on the
    emerging hybrid technologies and their significance in the effective treatment
    of pharmaceutical wastewater. This review paper primarily elaborates on the merits
    and demerits of existing conventional technologies helpful in developing integrated
    technologies for the modern era of pharmaceutical effluent treatment. This review
    paper further in detail discusses the various strategies of eco-friendly bioremediation
    techniques namely biostimulation, bioaugmentation, bacterial degradation, mycoremediation,
    phytoremediation, and others for the ultimate removal of pharmaceutical contaminants
    in wastewater. The review makes clear that targeted and hybrid solutions are what
    the world will require in the future to get rid of these pharmacological prints.

    For life to exist and to be called the blue planet water is a vital resource.
    Water plays an undeniable role in serving humans, animals, aquatic organisms,
    and industries. In the past decades, this renewable source of energy has faced
    a lot of pollution. The primary sectors of water pollutants are domestic, stormwater
    runoff, and industries. The pollutants are widely released from oil spills, heavy
    metals, chemicals, pesticides, littering, herbicide animal waste, and so on. About
    one-third of the freshwater is consumed by these industries leading to the release
    of different pollutants primarily into the aquatic system (Schwarzenbach et al.,
    2010). Population growth leading to demand requirements has increased industrialization.
    According to the database of AQUASTAT around 3928 km3 of freshwater is drawn globally
    by industries (Aulakh et al., 2010). Casual disposal, improper treatment or under-treatment
    of the effluents, and direct disposal of the materials largely affect the ecosystem
    and environment. Cadmium (Cd), nickel (Ni), iron (Fe), arsenic (As), phenolic
    compounds, petroleum hydrocarbons, sulfides, and other heavy metals from industrial
    chemicals are impossible to remove entirely (S. Lokhande et al., 2012; Wang and
    Yang, 2016). Organic pollutants remain in the sludge even after the primary treatment
    (Liu et al., 2014). When these chemicals enter air, water, or soil they cause
    health imbalances mainly in non-targeted organisms. Cyanosis, sweating, reflex
    loss, respiratory failure, cancer, reproductive disruption, and low body temperature
    are some of the health conditions created by industrial effluents released into
    the abode (Menon et al., 2020). Pharmaceutical compounds are made of either synthetic
    or natural chemicals that can cure many diseases and save lives. These compounds
    are active in lower concentrations, readily absorbed, and remain in the body until
    they are fully effective (Mezzelani et al., 2018). Pharmaceutical compounds are
    raised as emerging contaminants (Liu et al., 2015). The presence of such pharmaceutical
    active compounds is a major concern in the aquatic environment that poses serious
    health effects (Zhang et al., 2023). Hospitals, households, and pharmaceutical
    manufacturing industries release these compounds directly into the sewage system
    (Carvalho and Santos, 2016; Changotra et al., 2019). The efficiency of removing
    such pollutants depends on two important prime conditions such as biotic and abiotic
    factors (Mojiri et al., 2022). Though these compounds are detected in lesser concentrations,
    prolonged and chronic exposure can lead to harmful effects (Ben et al., 2019;
    Carvalho and Santos, 2016). When a drug is consumed by humans 30–90 % of the dose
    is released as active substances through urine. Industrial effluents contain 90
    % of the active substances even after treatment (Ternes, 1998). The common types
    of pharmaceutical compounds in the environment include antibiotics, NSAIDs, steroids,
    antidepressants, lipid regulators, hormones, and beta-blockers (Kaur et al., 2016).
    These drugs are mostly disposed of in fresh and ground waters (Madikizela et al.,
    2017). Apart from these drugs laboratories, and dialysis units play an equal contribution
    in wastewater treatment(N. A. M.S. Khan et al., 2021). Metformin, a commonly prescribed
    antidiabetic drug, is experiencing an increase in consumption for diabetes treatment.
    As a result, it is being detected in wastewater treatment plants where conventional
    methods are unable to effectively remove it (Parra-Marfil et al., 2023). After
    administration, metformin is primarily excreted from the human body without significant
    metabolism, leading to its presence in wastewater influent at concentrations exceeding
    100 μg/L (Kumar et al., 2021). Studies have observed metformin concentrations
    ranging from 20 to 94 μg/L in wastewater, and in surface/groundwater samples,
    levels as high as 1700 ng/L have been detected (Prashanth et al., 2021). 17-ethinyl
    estradiol is a steroid hormone that is detected in aquatic bodies in a concentration
    of 1–4 ng/L. These lower concentrations stimulate rupture in the kidney, and intestine,
    and affect reproduction in fishes (Quesada et al., 2019). Pharmaceutical drugs
    such as antibiotics and analgesics show up to 90 % activity even after 28–40 years
    from the date of production. In upcoming decades, the release of these drugs without
    proper treatment to the ecosystem will lead to possible risk effects on earthlings
    (Madikizela et al., 2017). The hospital effluents that are mixed with water resources
    can cause serious health effects. These effluents are treated with the hospital
    wastewater treatment plants that reduce the complex chemical compounds from the
    water. Here advanced oxidation process such as ozonation and peroxane has been
    used (Khan et al., 2020a,b). Industrial effluents are mostly treated using wastewater
    treatment plants to treat dangerous chemicals, suspended solids, and other toxins
    (Ondarza et al., 2019). WWTP (Wastewater Treatment Plant) can remove solids only
    to a certain level leaving particulate matter and complex chemicals in the effluents
    (Majumder et al., 2019). Filtration, flocculation, adsorption, and sedimentation
    are some of the methods used to remove drugs. These methods are not efficient
    as they require secondary treatment methods. UV radiation, Biochar, activated
    carbon, electrocoagulation, advanced oxidation process, and bioremediation are
    some of the current methods that are proven to remove pharmaceutical drugs (De
    Souza et al., 2018). Degradation of pharmaceutical products using bioremediation
    is one of the most welcoming methods when compared to others. The use of bioremediation
    is simply a greener way to remove chemicals without undergoing secondary treatments.
    These materials are readily degradable, available, and cost-effective. Nanotechnology
    combined with bacteria or microalgae has proven to remove persistent pharmaceutical
    drugs from the environment (Corsi et al., 2018). Aspergillus tubingensis iron
    oxide nanoparticles extracted from the rhizosphere of Avicennia officinalis in
    Sundarbans, India were able to remove 90 % of heavy metals for five cycles (González-González
    et al., 2022; Mahanty et al., 2020). Biosparging, Bioleaching, Bioremediation,
    Mycoremediation, and Phytoremediation are effective and environmentally friendly
    ways to remove pharmaceutical effluents quickly. Another interesting way to remove
    pollutants is wetland cultivation. Wetlands can remove pharmaceutical products
    at monsoon times. However, a detailed understanding, and verification of the process
    is yet to be studied in detail (Alsubih et al., 2022). Therefore, based on the
    available methods used to treat pharmaceutical pollutants, this review aims to
    address the following research questions. RQ1 What is the significance of emerging
    hybrid technologies? RQ2 Merits and demerits of existing conventional techniques
    RQ3 Whether the techniques developed are environmentally friendly? The concern
    about wastewater treatment and the necessity of implementing sustainable technologies
    is elevating on a daily basis across industries. Efficient wastewater treatment
    not only benefits the industry''s sustainability but also the environment and
    public health. For practicing an effective wastewater treatment system, certain
    issues need to be resolved. The major issues rely on a lack of knowledge about
    sources of waste and the technologies utilized to decontaminate them. Outdated
    techniques fail to achieve the desired outcomes due to the advent of novel contaminants
    from several sectors. One such sector is the pharmaceutical industry and the failure
    to treat the effluents effectively outbursts multiple life-threatening health
    disorders along with hazardous environmental impacts. To address the above questions,
    the review paper primarily elaborates on the merits and demerits of existing conventional
    technologies helpful in developing integrated technologies for the modern era
    of pharmaceutical effluent treatment. This review paper further in detail discusses
    the various strategies of eco-friendly bioremediation techniques namely biostimulation,
    bioaugmentation, bacterial degradation, mycoremediation, phytoremediation, and
    others for the ultimate removal of pharmaceutical contaminants in wastewater.
    The review makes clear that targeted and hybrid solutions are what the world will
    require in the future to get rid of these pharmacological prints. 1.1. Research
    methodology The present study is exclusively based on secondary sources. The data
    related to pharmaceutical effluent treatment to retrieve scientific findings were
    collected from various reviews and research papers published in reputed journals,
    and conference proceedings through various databases such as Scopus, Web of Sciences,
    Google Scholar, cited journals, etc based on the following keywords Bioremediation,
    Emerging pollutants, Health effects, Industrial wastewater, pharmaceutical effluents
    and more. Publications from 229 articles including research articles, reviews,
    etc were taken into consideration for the structure of the review paper. The structure
    of this review paper is framed as follows: Introduction, Generation of various
    Industrial effluent with special emphasis on pharmaceutical waste and its impact
    on the environment followed by the various treatment methods and hybrid technology,
    future perspectives, and conclusion. In the last section of this review paper,
    all the referenced articles are cited. This study employs a comprehensive research
    methodology designed to address the following outlined research questions. RQ1
    What is the significance of emerging hybrid technologies? RQ2 Merits and demerits
    of existing conventional techniques RQ3 Whether the techniques developed are environmentally
    friendly? The goal of the study is to identify gaps in the field and understand
    the existing status of industrial wastewater management. It addresses how the
    environment is being polluted by the huge amount of pharmaceutical waste released
    into the water bodies as well as other pollutants from various industries. The
    review also focuses on different methodologies such as physical and biological
    methods that have been employed in recent studies to investigate and address the
    removal of pharmaceutical effluents from wastewater, and how these methodologies
    contribute to our understanding of effective treatment strategies and environmental
    impact mitigation. It includes in-depth studies on ozone/H2O2, photocatalytic
    ozonation, membrane bioreactors, and other hybrid approaches. This review provides
    practical insights into the performance, challenges, and benefits of these technologies
    in pharmaceutical effluent treatment. Based on the findings from the existing
    sources, it was observed that hybrid technologies are very much needed to treat
    pharmaceutical industry effluents when compared to a single method in terms of
    efficiency in the future. Therefore, the review addresses the need for new technologies
    that may overcome the obstacles in conventional methods, and the need for upgrading
    current technologies like hybrid technologies will open the door to a better future
    towards the sustainable and economic development of any country. 2. Industrial
    effluents The birth and presence of life rely on one of the prominent sources
    “The Water” (Singh et al., 2020). With increased population and massive industrialization
    have led to massive pollution in water bodies (Edokpayi et al., 2017; Erkekoglu
    and Kocer-Gumusel, 2016). There are three major sectors Fig. 1 from which wastewater
    is released namely domestic, industrial, and stormwater runoff water (Kweinor
    Tetteh et al., 2019; Schoen and Ashbolt, 2010). While stormwater runoff is caused
    by heavy rain and flood they carry away the pesticides, pathogens, insecticides,
    and other chemicals from open surfaces and discharge them directly into nearby
    lakes, ponds, and rivers (Bani-Melhem and Elektorowicz, 2011; Ratola et al., 2012).
    Domestic wastewater is primarily due to household activities such as cooking and
    cleaning (Das and Acharya, 2003; Jonnalagadda and Mhere, 2001). The domestic wastewater
    is segregated based on its color (Larsen et al., 2015). Blackwater is the most
    contaminated form of domestic wastewater that contains fecal matter, detergent,
    discarded food wastes, and other chemicals. Grey water is the least contaminated
    form of domestic wastewater that contains only urine fecal matter (Al-Jayyousi,
    2003). Surface irrigation is considered one of the major causes of agricultural
    wastewater (Environmental, 2020; Vymazal, 2009). Rapid industrialization to gap
    the increasing demands is also a cause for water contamination (Azimi et al.,
    2017; Mahar and Datta, 2001; Pohl, 2020). Download : Download high-res image (585KB)

    et al., 2017). Industries have become one of the vital sectors of water pollution
    caused by industries.different as Table 1 types of industries release different
    types of pollutants. Industries are often linked with nearby water sources of
    municipalities like lakes, rivers, and ponds (Aulakh et al., 2010; Ekwanzala et
    al., 2021). These drinkable waters are polluted by the effluents that are released
    from the industries affecting human, animal, and aquatic existence (Barceló et
    al., 2020). Many of these effluents contain organic contaminants that lead to
    hormonal imbalance, reproductive disruptions, respiratory failures, and cancers
    (Mangalekar, 2012; Rajaram and Das, 2008; Uddin, 2021). These pollutants further
    affect food and the life cycle of the environment. One of the emerging industries
    as pollutants is the pharmaceutical industry (Chen et al., 2022; Dhangar and Kumar,
    2020). Table 1. Principal water pollutants from individual industries. S.No. Production

    (Chaudhry and Garg, 2018; Garg, 2022) Pharmaceutical products in effluents have
    leveled up in recent cycles (Rodil et al., 2012). Drug manufacturing, direct disposal
    of unused drugs, veterinary medicines, use of diagnosis kits, and improper treatment
    of pharmaceutical products caused rapid leverage of contaminants (Bilal et al.,
    2020). Pharmaceutical products have longer shelf life, and half-life and are readily
    soluble in water making them hard to treat (Velempini et al., 2021). These drugs
    often reach lakes, ponds, and surface and groundwater areas (McCallum et al.,
    2019). A variety of pharmaceutical compounds such as antibiotics, hormone-balancing
    tablets, and other contaminants are found in trace amounts in drinking water from
    a few nanograms to milligrams (Chander et al., 2016). Antineoplastic drugs are
    increasingly released into aquatic resources, according to recent studies (Yadav
    et al., 2021). These drugs residual in the water bodies result in ecotoxicity,
    cytotoxicity, and mutagenicity (Yadav et al., 2023). 2.1. Pharmaceutical wastes
    and their effect on the environment The invention of pharmaceuticals or medicine
    was a breakthrough in human history. From the first ever modern medicine morphine
    to the recent COVID drugs, pharmaceuticals have saved millions and trillions of
    lives on the planet. Veterinarians and humans get treated using pharmaceuticals
    (Maalouf and Maalouf, 2021). The term pharmaceuticals covers a huge class of drugs
    including unprescribed drugs, veterinary drugs, symptomatic agents, prescription
    drugs, and nutraceuticals (Acevedo-García et al., 2020). The success story has
    now been raised a concern as they are declared as “Emerging Pollutants.” Water
    pollution is mainly caused by pharmaceutical industries (Miller et al., 2018).
    The most commonly used and released pharmaceutical drugs are mentioned in (Fig.
    2). The detection of drugs in aquatic bodies has a small range of ng/L to mg/L
    (Daughton, 2004). Download : Download high-res image (639KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 2. Most common types of drugs released by pharmaceutical
    industries. Pharmaceutical pollutants differ from other pollutants in the following
    ways: 1) they are not able to be constrained as they play an important role in
    health, 2) having molecular masses greater than 500 Da (Kümmerer, 2009), 3) complex
    chemical complexes in molecular masses, composition, structure and functionality
    (Rivera-Utrilla et al., 2009), 4) polar compounds, 5) depending on medium pH the
    properties and ionization degree changes (Lipinski et al., 1997), 6) average water
    solubility and lipophilic properties (Kümmerer, 2009), 7) not easily degradable
    hence accumulate in life forms 8) when consumed readily absorbed by the body and
    alternates metabolism (González-Alonso et al., 2017; Rivera-Utrilla et al., 2013).
    The presence of pharmaceuticals in aquatic systems was first reported in 1970
    (Gould and Richards, 1984; Sievers et al., 1977). These compounds were not given
    much importance as they were in untraceable amounts. In the past three decades,
    these compounds have been present in almost all parts of the world including Antarctica
    and Arctic circles (Esteban et al., 2016). In today''s time, more than 600 pharmaceuticals
    have been known as worldwide contaminants (aus der Beek et al., 2016). A study
    conducted by the University of Gothenburg has revealed that about mg/L of several
    pharmaceutical effluents are present in a WWTP near Hyderabad, India (Halling-Sørensen
    et al., 1998). Pharmaceutical effluents'' effect on the environment has not yet
    been justified. Chronic and prolonged exposure to these chemicals on non-targeted
    organisms has shown mild effects such as reproductive and metabolic changes (Zaied
    et al., 2020). Fluoroquinolone antibiotics have shown genotoxic effects on the
    genetically modified variety of Salmonella typhimurium under 5 (Bilal et al.,
    2020). Benthic bacteria''s ability to nitrification in sewage has been decreased
    by the existence of antibiotics. Antibiotics namely erythromycin, amoxicillin,
    and clarithromycin are the major reasons to stop nitrification in the sewage system.
    The second most commonly found product next to antibiotics is Endocrine-disrupting
    chemicals (EDC) (Mandeep and Shukla, 2020). The presence of pharmaceutical drugs
    in the environment has serious effects on wildlife, and humans (Raja and Devarajan,
    2021). These compounds cause cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, obesity, cancer,
    and altered behaviours. Endocrine disruptive chemicals are made up of aromatic
    hydrocarbons and heavy metals which lead to deadly illnesses on chronic exposure
    (Kasonga et al., 2021; Strenn et al., 2004). WWTP is profitless in treating pharmaceutical
    products because of their complex structure, function, and shelf life (Hanson
    and Gluckman, 2011). In the households of Lisbon, and Belgium about 90 % of the
    anticancer drugs are delivered to outpatients. This points out that household
    effluents can also be an important factor in freshwater contamination. It is important
    to improve the Domestic wastewater treatment plants (Cristóvão et al., 2020).
    A wide range of anti-cancer drugs were detected in hospital effluents. The traces
    were seen in river water samples, and wastewater treatment plants (Cristóvão et
    al., 2019). Advanced methods such as carbon-based adsorption, silica-based adsorption,
    bioremediation, and chemical advanced oxidation processes are used for the eradication
    of pharmaceutical waste on earth (Quesada et al., 2019). 3. Methods used in the
    removal of pharmaceutical effluents from the wastewater 3.1. Physical method 3.1.1.
    Adsorption A process that mainly involves a phase transfer of the chemical substances
    from the phase called fluid to the surface of solid or liquid surfaces is called
    adsorption. The solid surface that has been involved in the adsorption process
    has active sites that can cause interaction between the solute in the aqueous
    phase by using spatial arrangement on specific properties of electrons. These
    types of solid materials that will provide a surface for absorption are called
    adsorbents and species that will be adsorbed are called adsorbate (Worch, 2012).
    The major factors that can influence the adsorption process are the nature of
    the adsorbate and adsorbent, temperature, time that is in contact, concentration
    of the pollutant, size of the particle, pH, presence of other wastes and the certain
    conditions of the experiment (Bhuyan and Ahmaruzzaman, 2023; Uddin, 2021). Studies
    for the usage of adsorbents in the removal of pharmaceutical waste from the aqueous
    solution have shown that high affinity to the surface of adsorbent is present
    in hydrophobic pharmaceuticals compared to hydrophilic pharmaceuticals (Mansouri
    et al., 2021; Michael et al., 2013). Some of the adsorbents that are used in the
    treatment of wastewater are activated carbon, zeolite, clays, agricultural wastes,
    and industrial wastes such as fly ash, red mud, and sludge. In research by (Bhattacharyya
    et al., 2023) a novel coral-like MOF-derived Co@Co3O4/C nanohybrids have been
    used as the adsorbent material. They have proved their capability in the treatment
    of wastewater by treating a variety of antibiotics such as quinolones, sulfonamides,
    and tetracycline. 3.1.2. Adsorbents based on carbon Materials such as activated
    carbon, activated sludge charcoal, graphite, and so on are some examples of adsorbent
    materials that are based on carbon. The source of these materials is coal, lignite,
    peat, and coconut shells. For the removal of pharmaceutical substances in wastewater
    treatment, activated carbon is mostly used. This is because of its high surface
    area and availability. The activated carbon can be used either as a powder or
    granules commonly called powdered activated carbon and granular activated carbon
    respectively (Serrano et al., 2011). There are various studies made for obtaining
    activated carbon from different sources some of them are agricultural wastes of
    wheat, stones of olive and cherry, shells of sunflower, pecan and nuts, corn straw,
    bagasse, miscanthus, birch wood, pinecone, rapeseed, residues of cotton and olive,
    grape seeds, rice hulls, corn cob and hulls, hazelnut shells, cotton stalk, rice
    husk and straw, corn stover, etc (Ioannidou and Zabaniotou, 2007). The characteristics
    of the activated carbon depend on their precursor and methods of preparation.
    Activated carbon obtained from waste cakes of olive can absorb drugs such as diclofenac,
    ketoprofen, and ibuprofen from the waste water (Baccar et al., 2012). The adsorption
    of nitroimidazole on the surface of activated carbon depends upon the chemical
    properties of activated carbon. From this, it can be seen that the adsorption
    of pharmaceutical compounds has non-electrostatic interactions (Rivera-Utrilla
    et al., 2009). 3.2. Clays Materials that occur naturally and are made up of some
    fine-grained minerals are called clays. The minerals of clays are hydrous aluminosilicates
    and the main building block is silicon-oxygen tetrahedron and aluminum octahedron
    (Adeyemo et al., 2017). They can be used as the adsorbent adsorption of pharmaceutical
    substances from wastewater because of the extensive specific surface area, cation
    exchange capacity that is higher, non-toxic properties, ability to absorb different
    kinds of molecules, and economically feasible. The adsorption of amitriptyline,
    a tricyclic antidepressant, has been observed to be absorbed in the palygorskite
    clay (Tsai et al., 2016). Tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and sulfamethoxazole
    are adsorbed in mont-morillonite, and kaolinite in the clay mineral dispersion
    process. The ibuprofen is identified to be adsorbed in montmorillonite, kaolinite,
    and goethite at the capacity of 6.1 mg/g, 3.1 mg/g, and 2.2 mg/g respectively
    (Behera et al., 2012). The absorption of gemfibrozil, mefenamic acid, and naproxen
    is studied in exfoliated vermiculite and Lightweight expanded clay aggregates
    (Lei et al., 2021). 3.3. Adsorbents based on silica These adsorbents are used
    for the removal of pharmaceutical wastes because of their specific surface area,
    inertness of chemicals, larger pore size, and various functional groups (Chircov
    et al., 2020). Pharmaceuticals such as carbamazepine, diclofenac, Ibuprofen, clofibric
    acid, cloprop, ciprofloxacin, and norfloxacin can be absorbed using silica-based
    adsorbents. The hexagonal mesoporous silicate will provide the absorption of ciprofloxacin
    and carbamazepine residues (Samia et al., 2012). The Iron (Fe)-impregnated silicates
    can be used for the adsorption of tetracycline from the aqueous systems (Legnoverde
    et al., 2014) while high-silica zeolite can be used in the adsorption of sulfonamide
    antibiotics (Turku et al., 2007). 3.4. Chitosan The sugar molecule that is obtained
    from the hard outer skeleton of shellfish such as crabs, lobsters, and shrimps
    is known as chitosan. Because of their special properties as biocompatibility,
    biodegradability, and non-toxicity with the adsorption capacity they are used
    in the eco-friendly removal of pharmaceutical wastes. In some studies, chitosan
    is modified or grafted and then used in the adsorption of pharmaceutical substances.
    The carboxyl-grafted chitosan is used for diclofenac removal (Tzereme et al.,
    2019) and modification of chitosan derivatives crosslinked with glutaraldehyde
    and are grafted with sulfonate and N-(2- carboxybenzyl) groups are used for pramipexole
    dihydrochloride removal (Tzereme et al., 2019). 4. Biological degradation The
    biological treatment processes can be made for the treatment of wastewater because
    of their cost efficiency and the process effectiveness (Sirtori et al., 2009).
    These systems are classified based on the living status of the organism that is
    attached or suspended growth (Su et al., 2015). The activated sludge processes
    have been used for the removal of veterinary drugs such as enrofloxacin, tetracycline,
    and ceftiofur (Carvalho et al., 2013). There are various other applications of
    activated sludge in degradation of the pharmaceutical wastes such as beta-lactam
    antibiotics (Abou-Elela et al., 2013), clofibric acid, diclofenac, mefenamic acid,
    ibuprofen, ketoprofen, naproxen (Kimura et al., 2007). Rotating biological contactors
    (disc biofilm reactors) use solid media that helps in the growth of the microbes
    in a biofilm that is static. The disc can be rotated by a motor or air drive which
    helps in the diffusion process and removes the waste (Hassard et al., 2015). The
    usage of this rotating biological contactor is easy dehydration compared to that
    of the activated sludge method because of the presence of large amounts of dry
    matter. Also, it is cost-effective when compared with the incineration process
    or the advanced oxidation process (Su et al., 2015). 4.1. Advanced chemical oxidation
    processes The advanced chemical oxidation process is a combination of methods
    that operate in the aqueous phase and help in the degradation of the pollutants
    (Klavarioti et al., 2009). In this process, strong oxidizing agents are used namely,
    ozone, peroxide, iron, manganese, and titanium oxide which are commonly combined
    with radiations that are of high energy such as UV irradiation. Then the hydroxyl
    radicals that are produced help in the oxidation of the pollutants (de Sena et
    al., 2009; Elkacmi and Bennajah, 2019). Some of the advanced chemical oxidation
    processes are namely, photolysis, ozonation, Fenton oxidation, heterogeneous photocatalysts,
    electrochemical oxidation, wet air oxidation catalytic wet air oxidation, and
    so on. Fig. 3 Photolysis is a process in which UV radiation interacts with the
    target molecule and can make a total mineralization process (Oturan and Aaron,
    2014). The process can be direct or indirect that degrades the molecule(Remucal,
    2014, Zhang et al., 2021). Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim is the antibacterial
    compound that has been treated with the help of the indirect photolysis process
    (Ryan et al., 2011). Then, in another study, it has been identified that the sulfamethoxazole
    was degraded by natural sunlight irradiation (Wang et al., 2017). Download : Download

    of chemical advanced oxidation processes(Bampos et al., 2021; Bañuelos et al.,
    2014; M. S. N.A. Khan et al., 2021; Kolaczkowski et al., 1999; Mian and Liu, 2018;
    Uddin, 2021). Ozone is one of the strongest oxidants that can degrade organic
    compounds both directly and indirectly (Klavarioti et al., 2009). The process
    in which ozone is used for treating the pollutants is called as ozonation process.
    There are various studies involved in pharmaceutical wastewater removal with the
    help of ozone. Some of them are urban wastewater, municipal wastewater, and so
    on (Ibáñez et al., 2013; Ternes et al., 2003). The pharmaceutical wastes such
    as sulfonamide, macrolide antibiotics, estrogen, and other acidic pharmaceuticals
    such as naproxen, indomethacin, and diclofenac have all been oxidized with the
    help of the ozonation process (Huber et al., 2005). Fenton oxidation is a method
    in which the hydroxyl radicals have been produced through a free radical chain
    reaction mainly in presence of the ferrous or ferric ions and hydrogen peroxide.
    This reaction is called a metal catalyst oxidized reaction (Klavarioti et al.,
    2009). Fenton oxidation processes are used for the treatment of pharmaceutical
    wastewater and they can also be combined with the ultrafiltration, reverse osmosis,
    and nanofiltration process (Sipos et al., 2010). The electro-fenton process is
    used for the removal of diclofenac sodium drugs (P Shah, 2017). Their other pharmaceuticals
    such as amoxicillin, ampicillin, diclofenac, paracetamol 64, and metronidazole
    are degraded using the Fenton oxidation process (Shemer et al., 2006). The ibuprofen
    and carbamazepine present in the aqueous solution are oxidized by the photocatalysis
    process (Georgaki et al., 2014). In some other studies diclofenac, ofloxacin,
    carbamazepine, sulfamethoxazole, and clofibric acid all reduced their half-life
    in the photocatalysis process (Andreozzi et al., 2003). The mineralization and
    degradation kinetics of diclofenac and carbamazepine were re-investigated using
    the photocatalysis method (Rizzo et al., 2009). The antibiotic tetracycline is
    successfully absorbed by photodegradation coupled with titanium oxide, and cuprous
    oxide nanoparticles (Sharma et al., 2022). The photodegradation of some consumed
    antibiotics has been studied with the help of copper oxide and titanium oxide
    nanotubes. Those antibiotics are amoxicillin, cefixime, azithromycin, and ciprofloxacin
    (Sharma et al., 2023). TiO2-based photocatalysis has been used for the removal
    of pharmaceutical pollutants, mainly the cytostatic compound antibiotics from
    the wastewater. So that wastewater can be reused and utilized(S. Kumar et al.,
    2022a,b; Sharma et al., 2022). The electrochemical process can be used for the
    degradation of sulfamethoxazole by oxidizing it electrochemically (Hussain et
    al., 2015). Also, the electrochemical degradation of N-(4-hydroxyphenyl) acetamide
    and anodic oxidation of atenolol can be done (Brillas et al., 2005). The pharmaceutical
    wastes that are unfeasible to purify using direct biological purification then
    wet air oxidation method can be used (Karungamye et al., 2022). An alternative
    method that has been used for the management of greywater has been discussed in
    the study by (Borah et al., 2023) is the reuse in irrigation and cultivation of
    crops. Here the removal of surfactants has been described as hardest and alternative
    methods have been proposed. 4.2. Bioremediation of pharmaceutical effluents 4.2.1.
    Microbial bioremediation The increased pollution caused by rapid industrialization
    was becoming a significant concern (Wani et al., 2022). The use of microbes for
    the removal of these pollutants is becoming a popular method (Priyanka et al.,
    2019). Microbial degradation can be classified as the complete degradation or
    breakdown of pollutants into carbon dioxide and water or any other non-toxin molecule
    (Götz et al., 2018). For microbial remediation, the usage of bioreactors is essential
    for the effective growth of the microbes. From the research of (Madukasi et al.,
    2010) it has been identified that Rhodobacter sphaeroides have the capacity for
    the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater that is enhanced with ammonium sulfate
    and yeast extract. Laccase is an enzyme produced by the microbial consortium and
    it is used for the bioremediation of the pharmaceutical treatment (Chander et
    al., 2016). In a research pharmaceutical wastewater from different places in TamilNadu
    has been collected and the microbial consortiums are made with the following bacteria
    and are used for the treatment and it has achieved a considerable effect. The
    microbes are Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus megaterium, Pseudomonas fluorescens,
    phosphate solubilizing bacteria, Pseudomonas putida, Bacillus pumilis, Nitrobacter,
    Aspergillus niger, Bacillus licheniformis, Nitrosomonas, Rodococcus (Chakraborty
    et al., 2013). G. lucidum, P. chrysosporium, and T. versicolor are used for cyclophosphamide
    and etoposide biodegradation (Yadav et al., 2022). 4.2.2. Mechanism of degradation
    in microbial cell In the above Fig. 4, the pharmaceutical compounds contain aromatic
    hydrocarbons that are toxic to the planet. When these compounds enter into the
    cells of certain microorganisms, they are absorbed faster which makes them disappear
    or get eliminated out via excretion or by catabolism. This process is called bioaccumulation.
    Heavy metals and ions can be removed by a biosorption process. Specific types
    of microorganisms can absorb or solubilize heavy metals in their cell surface.
    Certain types of pharmaceutical waste can be absorbed by this method. Wastewater
    contains heavy metals and ions in the sludge. Bioprecipitation is used to settle
    down the heavy metals and solids in industrial effluents. Specified bacteria can
    coagulate and precipitate heavy metals (Me, Cu, Zn), ions (HPO2− 4, S2−, CO3),
    and solids so that they can later be removed without getting released into the
    environment. Biotransformation is the ability to modify a specific or a mixture
    of chemical compounds. Oxidation, methylation, and reduction are some of the methods
    that are used in biotransformation. By changing their chemical composition, the
    hydrocarbons and other chemicals that are found in pharmaceutical drugs are disintegrated
    into small forms. This can be used in industrial treatment plants to disintegrate
    complex chemicals into simpler ones. These are some of the microbial remediation
    mechanisms that can be used to treat pharmaceutical effluents (Mamta et al., 2020)

    building steps for degradation Consortium is an advanced technology that uses
    different or the same group of microorganisms from the environment to degrade
    or mineralize pharmaceutical compounds. Ecological sustainability can be achieved
    by performing this method ahead of secondary treatment. The steps that are involved
    in building a microbial consortium Fig. 5: 1) Selection of site, sample collection,
    and storing. 2) Isolation, characterization. 3) Strain modification 4) Development
    of process and optimization. 5) Field trial and technology transfer. The selection
    of fields mainly depends on the geochemical process that is happening in the site.
    Contaminated sites are usually preferred for site selection. These sites have
    promising microbes as they can grow in the contaminated site which means they
    can degrade those toxic wastes. Once the site is selected and the sample is collected
    the hunt for the isolation of microorganisms starts. The microorganisms are selected
    and cultured in two ways. The first one is looking for the microbes according
    to the literature review and growing the isolates with the desired medium, pH,
    and temperature. The other approach is culture-independent. Isolation of microorganisms
    takes place by closely examining the sample and then deciding on the growth medium
    for further process. The consortium involves different types of microorganisms
    similar or different; however, they have to be optimized as the parameters decide
    their capability. Response surface methodology (RSM) is used as it can predict
    the exact temperature, pH, and other parameters that are required for the growth.
    Once the strains are selected, they are then engineered or synergistically improved
    to target a specific compound. After the optimization of the consortium, the field
    research takes place in an open environment condition. In industries, the microbial
    consortium is mixed in a single bioreactor to mineralize and degrade different
    pharmaceutical products (Mamta et al., 2020). 4.3. Mycoremediation Fungi used
    for the treatment of waste water are called mycoremediation. In this process,
    fungi are used for the degradation of effluents and they have a major application
    in the removal of pharmaceutical effluents. The mycelia of fungi play a vital
    role in the mycoremediation process where the mycelium present in the fungi can
    carry out the decomposition process (González-González et al., 2022). The mycoremediation
    can be done by filamentous fungi as well as macrofungi (Gupta and Pathak, 2019).
    The fungal species such as Aspergillus niger, Aspergillus fumigatus, and Aspergillus
    niveus can be used in the pharmaceutical pollutant''s removal. The Ascomycetes
    family of fungi can remove pollutants from industrial wastewater (Nassiri Koopaei
    and Abdollahi, 2017). The white rot fungus can be used for the removal of tannic
    acid and humic acid; also, filamentous fungi such as basidiomycetes are used for
    the treatment of various other drug enzymatic changes. The usage of fungi for
    the treatment of pharmaceutical contaminants has advantages over other methods
    because of their high effectiveness, low cost, and environmental safety (Lakhani
    et al., 2022). 4.4. Phytoremediation The use of plants for the remediation of
    wastewater is called phytoremediation. The chemical pollutants can be removed
    by the plants through steps such as degradation, rhizoremediation, stabilization,
    and violation then there is a possibility of mineralization. The plants that have
    been used are willow and alfalfa (Azubuike et al., 2016). This process is a very
    cost-effective and environmentally friendly method where plants help in degrading
    the toxic chemicals. It is mainly because of the natural ability of certain plants
    that it can bioaccumulate pollutants and degrade them in a harmless method (Kumar
    et al., 2022a,b). Phytoremediation mainly seeks the removal of hazardous heavy
    metals and organic contaminants from the environment (Lakhani et al., 2022). Lupinus
    albus, Hordeum vulgaris, and Phragmites australis are plants that can be used
    for the degradation of certain pharmaceutical substances such as acetaminophen,
    ibuprofen, and diclofenac. The dyes that are used as analytical markers in the
    pharmaceutical industry can be removed with the help of water hyacinth also called
    Eichornia crassipes (Nath et al., 2014) Table 3 represents the type of pollutant,
    microalgae used for degradation, conditions in which the experiment is carried
    out, and removal efficiency. Table 3. The type of pollutant, microalgae used for

    is a technology that is used for the biodegradation of organic pollutants from
    wastewater. This technology helps in the activity of the endogenous bacteria,
    and archaea and helps in the biodegradation of the hydrocarbons. Bioventing is
    a process that enhances the oxidation of insecticides, organic hydrocarbons, and
    other pollutants through anaerobic degradation (Geremew, 2017). 4.5.2. Bioleaching
    A method that is used for the removal of low-grade ores and minerals from the
    metals with the help of bacteria. Some of the bacteria such as Thiobacillus ferrooxidans
    and Thiooxidants are used for the conversion of insoluble metal sulfides into
    some sulfates of metal. This method is mainly used for the removal of heavy metals
    (Praharaj et al., 2022). 4.5.3. Bioaugmentation This process helps in the improvement
    of the efficiency of the microbes by the addition of genetically modified bacteria
    that have complex catabolic functions, hence improving the rate of degradation
    (Abdulsalam et al., 2011). The addition of certain microbial strains in the wastewater
    bioreactor helps in the improved degradation of the specific chemicals by the
    forward-thinking strategy for efficient removal of pollutants. There are mainly
    two strategies in this process; they are bioaugmentation by indigenous and non-indigenous
    microorganisms (Poi et al., 2017). 4.5.4. Biostimulation Biostimulation is the
    process in which the insertion of electron acceptors, electron donors, or nutrients
    into the microbes occurs naturally for their activation. This process is mainly
    used for the improvement of the microbes for their degradation by some modifications,
    nutrient addition, or changing other restricting factors (Singh et al., 2016).
    4.5.5. Biosparging A technology that uses microorganisms for the degradation of
    organic constituents is called biosparging. To boost the biological activity of
    the microbes the air and nutrients have been fed into the saturated zone. This
    process is similar to the venting process, where the air is also injected along
    with stimulating the activity of the microbes (Kennedy and Jacoby, 1999). 5. Requirement
    of hybrid technology Existing techniques available for the treatment of wastewater
    have their own merits and demerits. Even though there are numerous methods exist
    to treat wastewater, adsorption is a simple and efficient method for removal of
    pharmaceutical pollutants present in the effluent due to low cost and easy handling
    (El-fatta et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2019), whereas it is ineffective due to
    the characteristics of the adsorbent. Treatment of wastewater using biological
    methods is the preferred one as it results in complete mineralization of the pollutant.
    However, the technique took much time to process and high cost. (Saravanan et
    al., 2021). Membrane technology has the advantage of mechanical stability but
    has the disadvantage of fouling which leads to less efficiency and is not economical
    in treatment. Recent techniques such as Advanced oxidation processes generate
    radicals that remove organic pollutants present in water. It also produces by-products
    that need to be treated effectively (Khoo et al., 2022). In comparison with individual
    and consortia, it is suggested that consortia are better than individual treatment.
    Hence it is recommended to go for consortia by integrating any of the individual
    treatments which lead to the development of hybrid technologies for enhancing
    the removal efficacy. 5.1. Hybrid technology The hybrid technology employs a diverse
    range of treatment methods, utilizing various combinations of removal mechanisms
    to enhance the quality of treated water. Hybrid technology has demonstrated superior
    effectiveness in common to individual methods. (Alardhi et al., 2020; Eniola et
    al., 2022; Saha et al., 2023). The hybrid membrane process stands out as a potent
    solution for eliminating emerging contaminants from wastewater. Through the implementation
    of these processes, water quality can be successfully restored, enabling sustainable
    reuse within the hydrological cycle while simultaneously minimizing both environmental
    and economic impacts. (khalidi-idrissi et al., 2023; Molinari et al., 2020; Schwaller
    et al., 2021). It is crucial for hybrid technologies to be designed to facilitate
    the simultaneous treatment processes of the combined treatment technologies. (Eniola
    et al., 2022). Additionally, hybrid systems have the potential to generate bioenergy,
    contributing to the reduction of operating costs for the system. (Ahmed et al.,
    2021; Eniola et al., 2022). The implementation of hybrid technologies, such as
    ozone/H2O2, photocatalytic ozonation, heterogenous catalytic ozonation, or the
    integration of the biological wastewater treatment process with ozonation. This
    approach leads to an optimized treatment scheme that combines different methodologies
    for enhanced effectiveness (Cadamuro et al., 2021; Ghazal et al., 2022). When
    selecting and designing hybrid systems, it is crucial to take into account parameters
    such as wastewater and pollutant characteristics, membrane specifications (including
    molecular weight cut-off and charge), fouling potential, and energy demand. These
    considerations are essential for optimizing the performance and efficiency of
    the hybrid treatment systems. Certainly, biological wastewater treatment is recognized
    as an environmentally friendly method that generates less sludge and is relatively
    cost-effective. However, it has limitations in effectively removing drug residues
    and demands considerable maintenance. In contrast, physicochemical methods are
    considered promising treatment approaches for pharmaceutical wastewater. Effective
    water management in the pharmaceutical industry is imperative at both the upstream
    and downstream stages of the plant. In the upstream phase, there is a critical
    need to conserve water through the judicious use and recycling of treated water.
    In the downstream phase, it is essential to address various forms of pollution
    before discharging water into the environment, emphasizing the recycling of treated
    water (khalidi-idrissi et al., 2023). The hybrid combination system shows particular
    promise in the treatment of pharmaceutical wastewater that contains target compounds
    featuring functional groups with high electron-withdrawing ability (Lee et al.,
    2022). Traditional and innovative approaches in diverse integrated and hybrid
    treatment technologies are being developed to decontaminate pharmaceutical pollutants
    from wastewater. (Eniola et al., 2022). The hybrid technology integrates two treatment
    systems, enhancing the efficacy of pharmaceutical pollutants removal from water
    (Eniola et al., 2022; Ghazal et al., 2022). In addition to hybrid technology,
    promising results were also observed with the implementation of membrane bioreactors
    MBR (Eniola et al., 2022). The necessity for hybrid technologies arises from the
    recognition that none of the individual treatment technologies, be it biological
    or advanced oxidation processes (AOPs), seems to be universally efficient in ensuring
    high removals for all parent compounds and their transformation products (Dhangar
    and Kumar, 2020; Ghazal et al., 2022). Subject to the hybrid combination system,
    the removal efficiency of the pollutant drug carbamazepine was improved. (Lee
    et al., 2022). While certain individual treatment methods have demonstrated high
    potential for removing specific drugs from pharmaceutical pollutants (PP) wastewater
    or achieving greater removal efficiencies for PP under specific experimental conditions,
    the overarching findings from the literature review suggest that the focus for
    future technological advancements should center on hybrid technology or the integration
    of two or more technologies. This approach is crucial for the development of enhanced
    technologies capable of eliminating a broader range of pharmaceuticals in a single
    operation (Eniola et al., 2022). The Excitation – Emission Matrix (EEM) analysis
    revealed the presence of biodegradable intermediates generated during the hybrid
    process (Lee et al., 2022). Various treatment approaches, encompassing biological
    treatment, membrane-related processes, adsorption, advanced oxidation processes,
    and more, have been investigated for the decontamination of pharmaceutical wastewater.
    Numerous studies have reported data on the removal of pharmaceutical pollutants
    (PP) from sewage treatment plants and municipal wastewater. Some researchers have
    delved into individual methods such as membrane bioreactors, constructed wetlands,
    adsorption, or hybrid/integrated technologies like Fenton-aerobic, biological-membrane-ultrasound.
    A hybrid treatment process that combines photocatalysis and biodegradation has
    demonstrated the removal of bio-recalcitrant pharmaceuticals, such as antibiotics,
    through photocatalysis and vice versa. This hybrid approach has the potential
    to generate a higher quality effluent for pharmaceutical wastewater after treatment
    (Yu et al., 2020). An attempt at hybrid combination of the Fenton and activated
    sludge processes for the treatment of carbamazepine in industrial wastewater (Lee
    et al., 2022). In this hybrid combination process, the Fenton process was employed
    to break down non-biodegradable organic structures into fragments that could be
    easily degraded by microorganisms. The findings indicated that incorporating the
    Fenton process as a pre-treatment before activated sludge could serve as an alternative
    method to enhance the removal of aqueous carbamazepine (Lee et al., 2022). Due
    to the observed carbamazepine removal effectiveness in the Fenton process under
    neutral conditions, a hybrid approach combining the Fenton process with activated
    sludge treatment was implemented to investigate carbamazepine removal in this
    combined process (Eniola et al., 2022). The oxidation products of carbamazepine
    in the hybrid combination process were identified and characterized through liquid
    chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) (Lee et al., 2022). Similarly, a study
    conducted by (Valério et al., 2020)found that the degradation efficiency percentage
    was 20 % higher by using the hybrid technique which involves ozonation and photocatalysis.
    According to the research carried out by (Cadamuro et al., 2021; Çifçi and Meriç,
    2022), a cephalosporin antibacterial named ceftriaxone, and other compound amoxicillin
    were removed using the hybrid method. To validate this the removal efficiency
    of ceftriaxone and amoxicillin was found to be 93.17 % and 87.53 % respectively.
    (Pirsaheb et al., 2020). Likewise, the degradation of Diclofenac was carried out
    by hybrid adsorption-photocatalysis (Gupta et al., 2021). The removal efficiency
    of diclofenac was found to be 99.9 % and 93 % at an initial concentration of 60
    mg/L and 300 mg/L (Dekkouche et al., 2022; Li et al., 2019). While a limited number
    of studies have provided overviews of the ongoing development in PP removal using
    conventional and advanced technologies, none have presented a comparative discussion
    of these technologies in terms of their environmental and economic benefits (Eniola
    et al., 2022). Recently, advanced materials such as covalent organic frameworks
    (COF), metal-organic frameworks (MOF), and porous organic polymers have garnered
    significant attention owing to their distinctive physicochemical properties for
    the development of nanohybrid materials (Bhadra et al., 2020; Khedri et al., 2021).
    5.2. Membrane bioreactor The technology of membrane bioreactors (MBR) is regarded
    as a promising advancement in the microbiological treatment of wastewater, integrating
    both biological and membrane technologies(Liu et al., 2021; Morin-Crini et al.,
    2022). The treatment method employs a non-conventional mechanism for pharmaceutical
    pollutant removal (Li et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2021). Following the removal
    of biodegradable matter in the biological process within the reactor, the effluent
    undergoes additional purification by eliminating solutes through membrane filtration,
    resulting in the effluent of the desired quality. In comparison to conventional
    treatment methods, membrane bioreactors exhibit higher efficiency, improved sludge
    retention, and the ability to withstand fluctuating pollutant loads. On a pilot
    scale, membrane bioreactors have been successfully employed to treat pharmaceutical
    wastewater, achieving a remarkable COD removal rate of 95 % (Eniola et al., 2022).
    The hybrid system demonstrated removal efficiencies exceeding 84 % for pharmaceuticals
    and 98 % for COD when compared to a single bioreactor. The findings indicated
    that the inclusion of an ultrafiltration membrane mitigated the risk associated
    with the final effluent. Numerous studies have explored the integration of aerobic
    biological processes with membrane filtration as an alternative to conventional
    methods for removing pharmaceutical products from water. Additionally, another
    study suggested that MBR technology might exhibit selectivity in the degradation
    of pharmaceutical compounds (Eniola et al., 2022). Given the application of advanced
    technologies in pharmaceutical wastewater decontamination, the combination of
    two or more technologies (hybrid) appears to be the most effective approach. Membrane
    bioreactors (MBRs) are particularly promising treatment techniques as they integrate
    biological treatment methods with membrane technology. Despite facing challenges
    related to high maintenance costs, MBRs persist as one of the most effective solutions,
    scalable for large-scale applications (khalidi-idrissi et al., 2023). In treating
    pharmaceutical wastewater, another hybrid system combines the Membrane Bioreactor
    (MBR) with adsorption processes, specifically involving the addition of Powdered
    Activated Carbon (PAC). This hybrid PAC-MBR scheme achieves effective removal
    of pharmaceuticals through a combination of adsorption and biodegradation in a
    single step. Additionally, with the introduction of PAC, the toxic effects of
    inhibitors may be reduced by adsorbing non-biodegradable, toxic, and inhibitory
    organic matter. The hybrid PAC-MBR system results in a reduced amount of membrane
    fouling, potentially because some of the high-molecular-weight compounds are adsorbed
    onto the PAC pores instead of accumulating on the membrane surface. (Asif et al.,
    2020). 6. Future perspectives The presence of pharmaceutical products in the environment
    can be detected with different techniques. Importantly the levels and availability
    of the pharmaceutical products are measured for further understanding. Total Organic
    Carbon, LC-MS/MS with a triple quadrupole (QqQ) analyzer, filtration, precipitation,
    and coagulation, are some of the common methods used to remove the pollutants
    from water. However, some of these methods have drawbacks, and cause secondary
    pollution to the environment. Various technologies can remove pharmaceutical pollutants
    but most of them are not applicable in the natural environment. There are various
    types of methods and strategies for the bioremediation of pharmaceutical pollutants
    such as biostimulation, bioaugmentation, or both also bacterial degradation, mycoremediation,
    phytoremediation, and so on. Among these different techniques, bioremediation
    using microbial consortium is a well-developed technique. Microbial consortium
    selects microorganisms that grow by utilizing these chemicals in the site of pollution.
    Later, these microorganisms were introduced into the environment after thorough
    research to adsorb these chemicals. The degradation of pollutants with the help
    of microbes is the most effective and important method of the detoxification process
    present in natural environments. However, the implementation of bioremediation
    techniques into real-life practices is still a milestone to reach. The reason
    for this could be the unknown damages and danger it holds for the environment.
    Hence, these methods were practiced in a closed system rather than in the natural
    environment. To overcome these challenges, a new technology should be designed
    targeting specific contaminated areas where the pollutants are higher and the
    treatment must be done in the natural environments. It is important to focus the
    studies and ongoing research on microbial degradation, metabolization, and behaviour
    of microorganisms towards pharmaceutical substances, and the environment. This
    could also be possible by combining different technologies mentioned in this study
    and producing a new methodology for the removal or degradation with high efficiency.
    Industries are duly responsible for regulatory enforcement and appropriate maintenance
    after the implementation of next-gen hybrid technologies. Untimely maintenance
    affects the treatment efficiency due to pipeline blockage and malfunction. Investments
    and financial properties are to be stabilized to maintain and develop modernized
    effective infrastructure techniques. Public ignorance and disengagement may occasionally
    be the reason behind the shortcomings of wastewater management strategies. Regulations
    are to be updated in terms that build a balanced relationship between the industrial
    operators and common people for effective wastewater treatment constructing potential
    environmental impacts and public health. 7. Conclusion As living beings, we are
    prone to diseases, and treatments that include organic chemicals. The pharmaceuticals
    present in these wastewaters can cause various types of harmful effects to the
    environment and the ecosystem. The organic chemicals from the pharmaceutical industries
    were introduced into the wastewater treatment plants for removal of these pollutants.
    The presence of pharmaceuticals in the wastewater is very difficult to remove
    as they have active ingredients that can react rapidly. Another major issue for
    the removal of pharmaceutical products from wastewater is their cost. Hence, it
    is vital to use various technologies for the removal of pharmaceutical effluents.
    Some of the advanced technologies such as phytoremediation, microbial consortium,
    phytoremediation, mycoremediation, and photocatalytic degradation are discussed
    in detail in this review. Additionally, techniques such as adsorption and their
    different types, biological degradation using bioreactors, and advanced chemical
    oxidation processes were also discussed. Each method has its risk factors such
    as dosage, toxicity levels, microorganisms used and removal efficiency differs
    for different techniques. The review concludes that 100 % degradation of pharmaceutical
    products was hard to attain, and the use of these advanced techniques has not
    yet proved any real-life results. Hence, the demand for improving existing technology,
    and innovation towards new technologies that can hurdle these limits will pave
    the way for a better future. CRediT authorship contribution statement M. Vijay

  description: Wastewater treatment plant decision makers face stricter regulations
    regarding human health protection, environmental preservation, and emissions reduction,
    meaning they must improve process sustainability and circularity, whilst maintaining
    economic performance. This creates complex multi-objective problems when operating
    and selecting technologies to meet these demands, resulting in the development
    of many decision support systems for the water sector. European Commission publications
    highlight their ambition for greater levels of sustainability, circularity, and
    environmental and human health protection, which decision support system implementation
    should align with to be successful in this region. Following the review of 57
    wastewater treatment plant decision support systems, the main function of multi-criteria
    decision-making tools are technology selection and the optimisation of process
    operation. A large contrast regarding their aims is found, as process optimisation
    tools clearly define their goals and indicators used, whilst technology selection
    procedures often use vague language making it difficult for decision makers to
    connect selected indicators and resultant outcomes. Several recommendations are
    made to improve decision support system usage, such as more rigorous indicator
    selection protocols including participatory selection approaches and expansion
    of indicators sets, as well as more structured investigation of results including
    the use of sensitivity or uncertainty analysis, and error quantification.

  explanation: The paper reviews wastewater treatment plant technology selection methods
    in light of water sector circularity and sustainability targets. The review highlights
    the importance of using indicators that are aligned with the broader goals of
    the water sector, rather than focusing solely on the efficiency of the technology.
    The review also suggests that multi-objective optimization control methods can
    be used to optimize the operation of wastewater treatment plants, considering
    factors such as energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, and resource recovery.

    indicators 1. Introduction The wastewater sector is faced with many challenges
    that result from ageing and inefficient processes, including substantial carbon
    emissions, high energy consumption, regulatory compliance failures, and loss of
    public trust (Borzooei et al., 2019). Unfortunately they are only being worsened
    by the impacts of climate change, urbanisation, and population growth (Haldar
    et al., 2022). Although a plethora of technologies have been developed in recent
    years to combat these issues at a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) level by academia
    and industry (Kehrein et al., 2020), water utilities are unable to make the required
    investment decisions to shift towards sustainable wastewater treatment. Decision
    support systems (DSSs) have been used to support complex decision making in the
    water sector, including WWTPs with the aim of optimising technology selection
    procedures or process control to improve operational performance (Wardropper and
    Brookfield, 2022). Wastewater decision makers have additional considerations compared
    with other industries, as on top of conventional technical, economic, and environmental
    issues, the social and regulatory implications of their actions must be considered
    (Ullah et al., 2020). Commonly public perception and social acceptance problems
    arise when utilising and recycling wastewater streams to generate resources (Kehrein
    et al., 2020). Water provision and sanitation services are also highly regulated
    and must be protected due to their importance for society, industry, and the environment
    (Preisner et al., 2022). Additionally, it is proving difficult to create markets
    for new products recovered from wastewater, such as tackling the end-of-waste
    status for their use in the European Union (Palmeros Parada et al., 2022). Therefore,
    water utility and WWTP decision makers are facing stricter regulations to improve
    operation regarding human health protection, environmental preservation, and emissions
    reduction (Mannina et al., 2019), whilst simultaneously pursuing greater circularity
    and revenue generation through resource recovery strategies to improve business
    performance. This creates complex multi-objective problems when operating and
    selecting technologies for improving WWTPs, which are traditionally labour intensive,
    trial-and-error experiments that rely on the judgement of operators (Ntalaperas
    et al., 2022; Sucu et al., 2021). To ensure that all relevant information, performance
    trade-offs, and cause and effect relationships are taken into consideration when
    dealing with complex problems, DSSs must be utilised by the water sector for more
    robust decision making (Ullah et al., 2020). A DSS is a computational system that
    assists the user in choosing an optimal or consistent solution to a particular
    problem in a reduced timeframe, particularly when the solution is unclear, by
    aggregating often conflicting values or preferences to examine the trade-offs
    between solution objectives (Giupponi and Sgobbi, 2013; Mannina et al., 2019;
    Wardropper and Brookfield, 2022). A review by Mannina et al. (2019) classified
    wastewater DSS intentions as; design, energy consumption, operational optimisation,
    improvement of effluent quality, or environmental sustainability. Of course, decision
    makers may want to investigate a combination of or all of these goals at once,
    which can often be contradictory (Eseoglu et al., 2022). For example, WWTP direct
    emissions and electricity consumption typically increase when improving effluent
    quality, however, this action negatively impacts any net zero targets. Therefore,
    when using DSSs to solve multi-objective problems the goal of the study must be
    defined with clear constraints for optimisation, and an adequate number of relevant
    key performance indicators (KPIs) chosen, to ensure the resulting decision is
    a true reflection of the defined goals. Multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM)
    tools for selecting the optimal technology for a specific scenario have been developed
    in literature (Eseoglu et al., 2022; Južnič-Zonta et al., 2022; Sucu et al., 2021).
    Depending on MCDM application, the goals of the assessment will impact the KPIs
    used to constrain the decision-making process and final outcome. Conventional
    WWTP operation is monitored using effluent quality and consequently controlled
    with a few key parameters, meaning process control is often intuitive with operators
    unable to understand the real time impacts of their decisions (Ntalaperas et al.,
    2022). Another key area for DSS use in the water sector is online process optimisation,
    however, it has not been widely applied in WWTPs as improvements to sensors, mathematical
    models (soft sensors), and data visualisation are needed for precise operational
    monitoring and control. However, a combination of data-driven models and artificial
    intelligence enables performance prediction that can be used to reduce energy
    demand, decrease costs, improve effluent quality, and lower emissions (Matheri
    et al., 2022). Considering the transformation that WWTPs face to improve performance
    by reducing emissions, energy consumption, and operating costs whilst meeting
    stricter regulatory targets, water utilities are expected to become ever more
    reliant on DSSs to solve multi-objective problems for optimal selection and operation
    of sustainable technology. This study focuses on the use of multi-criteria DSSs
    to support these two functions for WWTP decision makers. Rather than focussing
    solely on their typology, analysis of the correct selection and utilisation of
    relevant KPIs during DSS application is prioritised, to ensure that outcomes fulfil
    decision maker requirements. This is a pertinent aspect of complex multi-objective
    decision-making and one which is often overlooked or undervalued by the methodologies
    in the literature. 2. Methodology 2.1. Wastewater sector goals Currently, there
    is a mismatch in terms of the decision maker goals and the KPIs selected when
    utilising DSSs at a WWTP level. Therefore, this section maps the wastewater ambitions
    of the European Commission which can be used to direct the utilisation of DSSs
    to meet water sector targets. The European Commission has directives which act
    as the framework for adequate wastewater treatment in the EU and are critical
    sources for understanding high-level water sector goals. However, in many cases
    they are decades old and do not reflect the regions recent sustainability ambitions
    (European Commission, 2022). The Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive (UWWTD)
    (91/271/EEC) published in 1991, acted as the basis for transforming European water
    systems by limiting pollutant levels in WWTP discharge. The Sewage Sludge Directive
    (86/278/EEC) was introduced for the correct use of sewage sludge in agriculture.
    It details the requirements in terms of heavy metal concentration, quantities
    of sludge applied per hectare, and the crops prohibited from application (Council
    of the European Union, 1986). Although the UWWTD and Sewage Sludge Directive have
    been successful in improving environmental and human health, as 92 % of wastewater
    is now treated satisfactorily (European Commission, 2022), the next generation
    of wastewater treatment must go beyond this to achieve the EU''s sustainability
    goals, whilst ensuring this fundamental objective is still maintained. To instigate
    further change to WWTPs, a proposal to update the UWWTD was published in October
    2022 with the aim of introducing new rules up to the year 2040 (European Commission,
    2022). This update will be key for delivering the European Green Deal''s zero
    pollution target and highlights many water sector goals that decision makers will
    need to adopt in Europe. It expands regulatory compliance to smaller plants and
    introduces binding energy neutrality targets for the sector, polluter pays for
    the treatment of toxic micropollutants, and minimum recovery rates for phosphorus.
    Additionally, improved data monitoring and usage are required for measuring and
    mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and micropollutants, and making KPIs
    public to improve benchmarking and transparency (European Commission, 2022). The
    European Commission is pursuing a CE to facilitate many of its sustainability
    targets, therefore, it published the CE Action Plan in 2020 (European Commission,
    2020). As part of this, the European Commission aims to intensify nutrient recovery
    from wastewater by establishing Integrated Nutrient Management Plans (Radini et
    al., 2023). Another key element is the development of Water Reuse Regulation (2020/741)
    to facilitate the circular use of wastewater effluents. The document provides
    a classification system regarding the technology required to achieve the contaminant
    levels for application to specific crop grades (European Parliament, 2020), relying
    on the use of Water Reuse Risk Management plans to ensure public and environmental
    health (Radini et al., 2023). WWTPs should improve effluent quality for the circular
    use of water, also reducing the quantity of raw water abstracted. Therefore, it
    is clear that for a sustainable and circular transition, WWTPs must focus on emissions
    reduction, resource recovery, and water reuse, and acknowledge the importance
    of proper data usage, to align with water sector goals at a European level. Analysis
    of regional government wastewater strategies is vital for creating useful DSSs.
    However, their it remains challenging to implement tangible decisions at WWTP
    level, as individual utilities have their own priorities based on local facets.
    Considering legislative constraints, sector-wide ambitions, and local factors
    can make the identification of priorities at a WWTP-scale challenging for decision
    makers. Therefore, rigorous indicator selection and usage is needed to ensure
    DSS KPIs align with stakeholder goals at every level of decision making, or else
    WWTPs are at risk of undesirable future impacts and events. 2.2. Article collection
    method 2.2.1. Research question There have been recent publications which discuss
    multi-criteria analysis (MCA) DSSs for the wastewater sector (Ddiba et al., 2023;
    Mannina et al., 2019), however they allude to issues that exist for the assessment
    and selection of technologies. Mannina et al. (2019) states that ‘sustainable
    aspects are incorporated in accordance to DSS developers, as there is no standard
    that can be applied while developing the systems’, whilst Ddiba et al. (2023)
    concludes that some sustainability implications are not adequately covered by
    decision support tools. This shows that a lack of standardisation has resulted
    in the development of indicator-based methodologies that do not fully consider
    the sector''s sustainability goals. However, the wastewater sector must meet the
    requirements set out in Section 2.1 in the coming years, therefore, this review
    systematically analyses the specific indicators selected, and how they are used
    by DSSs, to understand the impact on WWTP outcomes. This results in the research
    question of how are indicators selected and utilised in decision support tools
    for technology selection and process optimisation at WWTPs, and to what extent
    are sustainability and circularity pillars harmonised to meet decision maker goals?
    Additionally, the need to construct standardised DSS procedures to facilitate
    sustainability outcomes is highlighted, thus following literature review recommendations
    are provided to act as the starting point for this. The types of MCA used to facilitate
    complex decision making have already been the subject of systematic reviews (Kozłowska,
    2022), meaning the methods available in literature have already established. Therefore,
    they do not require further generalised study and is why the focus of this review
    is on DSSs implemented for wastewater technology assessment to understand current
    practices and provide recommendations for improvement. 2.2.2. Search strategy
    The evaluation of WWTP DSSs was completed using systematic review, following the
    guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses
    (PRISMA) method (Page et al., 2021). Articles describing multi-criteria, indicator-based
    DSSs for WWTP technology selection and process optimisation were collected from
    Scopus (www.scopus.com) and Web of Science (www.webofscience.com) databases. The
    configuration of this review required two independent searches to collect data
    using a combination of Boolean connectors, and a previous review in the area by
    Mannina et al. (2019) established the time series of 2018–2022. MCDM technology
    selection DSSs were found using the search term (“wastewater treatment” OR WWT
    OR WWTP OR sludge) AND (DSS OR “decision support system” OR MCA OR “multi criteria”
    OR MCDM OR “multi-criteria”) AND (selection OR identification OR KPI). Whilst
    the multi-objective optimisation DSS search used (WWTP OR “wastewater treatment
    plant” OR “wastewater treatment process”) AND (control OR operation OR monitoring
    OR optimisation OR optimization) AND multi AND (criteria OR objective) terms.
    2.2.3. Selection of studies Fig. 1 shows the steps taken to screen initial search
    results and collect articles used for review (Page et al., 2021). Results were
    exported to Mendeley reference management software for processing, and after removing
    duplicates 127 articles and 144 articles related to technology selection and process
    optimisation DSSs were identified respectively. They were then analysed to ensure
    the inclusion of only high-quality, peer-reviewed, original articles, thereby
    removing non-English, conference proceedings, book chapter, and review paper sources.
    Next, sources were primarily screened based on their title, and subsequently using
    the abstract and content in full, to establish the final list of articles. Technology
    selection DSSs were excluded if used for geographic location planning, source
    selection, resource allocation, performance assessment, or operation monitoring,
    and did not utilise multiple indicators for decision making. Process optimisation
    DSSs were excluded if only used for performance monitoring, fault-detection, visualisation
    tasks, load prediction, or sensor utilisation, and did not use multiple indicators
    to optimise control parameters. An additional six relevant articles were collected
    from a review paper by Mannina et al. (2019) investigating DSSs for WWTPs, to
    incorporate appropriate literature from outside the search time series. Download

    Flowchart of the steps taken during the article selection procedure (Page et al.,
    2021). 3. Technology selection DSSs The decision to invest in new technology at
    a WWTP is a complex and multi-faceted decision to fulfil business, sustainability,
    and regulatory targets. MCDM tools have been developed for this purpose, however,
    there is often little emphasis on linking the goals of the assessment with indicator
    selection, weighting, and scoring methods. This potentially leads to outcomes
    that do not truly satisfy all stakeholder and decision maker goals at regional,
    national, utility, community, or WWTP scales. Literature collected in Section
    2 is reviewed to understand conventional methods and highlight good practices
    regarding alignment of KPIs with DSS goals. Table 1 summarises the MCDM WWTP technology
    selection DSSs collected from literature, resulting in a total of thirty-one articles.

    Table 1 summarises DSS properties namely the technologies selected, aim, case
    study of application, and categories used to group assessment indicators. The
    four main technology groups selected using MCDM DSSs are; wastewater treatment
    (WWT), sewage sludge treatment (SST), water reuse (WR) and resource recovery (RR),
    or a combination thereof. Since 2018, the development of DSSs for the selection
    of RR technologies has emerged as a priority for decision makers. The aim of each
    DSS has been directly quoted from the source, as this is key to understanding
    specific goals of the DSS when selecting appropriate indicators to facilitate
    desired outcomes. Lastly, the categories defined when selecting indicators are
    provided, which is important for relating DSS goals to selected KPIs for technology
    assessment. The assessment category column in Table 1 highlights the popularity
    of using economic, environmental, social, and technical sustainability dimensions
    to group indicators. Steps of the reviewed MCDM DSSs are summarised in Fig. 2,
    including examples at each stage from the reviewed literature. Download : Download

    of MCDM technology selection DSSs, including examples and techniques available
    for use at each stage. The thirty-one papers developing MCDM technology selection
    DSSs were categorised in Table 1 based on the type of technology being assessed.
    Selection of WWT technologies is the most common with fifteen DSSs, as WWT decision
    making is complex so selection of treatment methods is challenging. RR is the
    second most common focus, which can be attributed to the emphasis placed on selecting
    sludge treatment technologies for recovery purposes (usually energy). This highlights
    the desire of decision makers to make use of a resource that was previously considered
    a waste during WWT, reflecting the modern objective to enhance circularity of
    the sector. Four DSSs for WR technology selection have been developed, acknowledging
    that due to global warming, water stress is being exacerbated for many people,
    requiring more efficient use of water by decision makers. Lastly, two DSSs focused
    solely on the selection of technologies for SST, whilst only one was developed
    that combined technology selection for WWT and SST. It is critical to list the
    type of technologies being selected by a DSS so that the correct assessment criteria
    or indicators can be integrated. This is reflected by the low number of WWT/SST
    DSSs, as it is difficult to select criteria that are suitable for the assessment
    of both treatment technologies since their goals and expected outcomes differ.
    3.1. DSS goals To ensure that selected technologies will result in the benefits
    expected by stakeholders and decision makers, the aim of DSS application must
    be clearly defined. As shown in Table 1, the most common aims used vague and generic
    language for the selection of the most suitable/appropriate/viable/best-fitting
    technology in ten DSSs. Although this reveals the intention of the DSS, rarely
    are these terms explained in a way that enables the user to understand what these
    ‘suitable’ technologies may look like considering the scenario of application.
    This lack of direction limits wider utilisation of developed DSSs and could explain
    why most are not used across multiple case studies. Next, nine DSSs aim for the
    identification/selection/prioritisation/recommendation of technologies for a specific
    function, including non-potable water reuse or resource recovery strategies. Although
    this instructs the user with regards to the expected function of selected technologies,
    it does not provide any justification as to the reasoning for their selection.
    Third, the aim of seven DSSs is to select sustainable or assess the sustainability
    of alternatives. This is not useful unless a vision of sustainable wastewater
    treatment is defined by the DSS developers, as users cannot fully understand how
    to assess and compare the sustainability of alternatives (targets summarised in
    Section 2.1 are useful here). Evaluation/analysis of technologies utilising specified
    criteria, such as environmental or economic aspects is another common DSS aim,
    with three identified from the collated list. These highlight the assessment criteria
    used to select technologies but does not provide the user with adequate reasoning
    of why they should implement the technologies. Finally, two DSSs aim to optimise
    or find the optimum solution, which is difficult to comprehend unless the objectives
    being optimised are explicitly defined. Without a clear definition of DSS aims,
    there is a disconnect in user knowledge, as the aim is key for understanding why
    a DSS is implemented and selecting the correct indicators to facilitate desired
    outcomes or water sector targets. Therefore, vague language must be mitigated,
    and complete definition of aims is encouraged from DSS developers to help users
    implement technology selection tools correctly. 3.2. Indicator selection As discussed,
    selection of assessment indicators or criteria when using any WWTP DSS is crucial
    to ensure the chosen technology fulfils decision maker and stakeholder goals.
    Therefore, methodologies implemented for indicator selection by DSSs are scrutinised
    and summarised in Fig. 3. Download : Download high-res image (152KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Methods of indicator selection used by MCDM
    technology selection DSSs, with the number DSSs using each method in bold. Fig.
    3 shows that it is common for DSS developers to self-select indicators or provide
    a list from which users can choose indicators, with little methodological explanation
    given (An et al., 2018; Castillo et al., 2016; Chhipi-Shrestha et al., 2017; Chrispim
    et al., 2020; Fetanat et al., 2021; Garrido-Baserba et al., 2015; Gherghel et
    al., 2020; Južnič-Zonta et al., 2022; Renfrew et al., 2022; Srivastava and Singh,
    2022; Sucu et al., 2021). This results in a significant gap in DSS user knowledge,
    as they are unable to reason whether the selected indicators are relevant to their
    scenario of application. Data availability can be used to guide indicator selection,
    relying on primary data where possible or secondary data acquired through reasonable
    effort, such as modelling, whilst meeting data quality requirements. To improve
    the robustness of indicator selection, some authors define criteria or provide
    additional justifications to choose appropriate indicators from literature (Arroyo
    and Molinos-Senante, 2018; Attri et al., 2022; Liu and Ren, 2022; Molinos-Senante
    et al., 2014; Nkuna et al., 2022; Palma-Heredia et al., 2020; Sadr et al., 2018).
    For example, Molinos-Senante et al. (2014) reasons indicator selection using transparent,
    representative, relevant and quantifiable evaluation criteria, however, definitions
    of these terms are not provided potentially resulting in ambiguity for the user.
    More complete approaches conducted structured literature reviews for indicator
    selection (da Silva Junior et al., 2022; Leoneti et al., 2022; Lizot et al., 2021).
    Lizot et al. (2021) describes the terms entered into literature search engines
    to collect assessment criteria utilised by other WWT MCDM tools, and then lists
    specific information and data availability requirements applied to create indicator
    shortlists. However, only a short description of shortlisting steps is given which
    focuses on technical aspects (such as plant load, location, or size), rather than
    sustainability goals. Alternatively authors used knowledge of local factors to
    select appropriate DSS indicators from literature (de Almeida et al., 2022; Oertlé
    et al., 2019). Đurđević et al. (2020) utilised their own judgement to select DSS
    indicators considering the state of wastewater and sewage sludge management, socio-economic
    standards, and available data (from national databases) in the local area. Liu
    et al. (2020) provides an explanation of the local context for each indicator
    provided, such as using economic costs as the project may need some financial
    support from the community or process simplicity due to the lack of professionals
    for operation. This strategy encourages the DSS user to consider local factors
    during decision making, however, a more robust approach is to use local stakeholder
    perspectives as well. Some DSS developers recognise the importance of rigorous
    indicator selection to achieve desired outcomes by utilising external expert or
    stakeholder opinions, for example to screen assessment criteria from a longlist
    identified during literature review (Ali et al., 2020; Salamirad et al., 2023).
    Ling et al., 2021a, Ling et al., 2021b developed a method starting with a round
    of literature review to collate indicators previously used to evaluate WWT performance.
    The list is then refined based on key terminology mentioned during interviews
    (thematic analysis using Nviva software) with water company employees utilising
    the DSS. Eseoglu et al. (2022) employs the use of a questionnaire study by experts
    from across many roles in WWTPs from design to operation, and combines this with
    other information including effluent discharge regulation, environmental impacts,
    and design parameters. These DSSs acknowledge that indicator selection is an important
    part of strategic MCDM, and the combination of stakeholder views with technical
    appraisal of local factors enables the user to select indicators which adequately
    reflect their goals. Fig. 3 highlights that these more robust indicator selection
    methods are less popular, helping to answer the research question by reporting
    a lack of robust methods for indicator selection in most of the DSSs developed
    for WWTPs. The specific indictors selected showed that only two DSSs did not utilise
    economic indicators (Chrispim et al., 2020; Fetanat et al., 2021), with most the
    common being capital and operating expenditure, whilst others chose life cycle
    costing (LCC) (Chhipi-Shrestha et al., 2017) and net present value analysis (Lizot
    et al., 2021). Removal efficiencies of regulated wastewater constituents, including
    total suspended solids (TSS), chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen
    demand (BOD), nitrogen, and phosphorus, were commonly selected to determine treatment
    performance (Arroyo and Molinos-Senante, 2018; Eseoglu et al., 2022; J Ling et
    al., 2021b; Liu et al., 2020; Molinos-Senante et al., 2015; Silva Junior et al.,
    2022). Indicators of environmental performance covered GHG emission (Gherghel
    et al., 2020; Južnič-Zonta et al., 2022; Jiean Ling et al., 2021a), carbon footprint
    (Chhipi-Shrestha et al., 2017; Renfrew et al., 2022), and life cycle assessment
    (LCA) (usually eutrophication, climate change, and acidification) impacts (Castillo
    et al., 2016; Lizot et al., 2021). Effort was made to consider the social impacts
    of technologies, commonly their odour and noise aspects (Eseoglu et al., 2022;
    Oertlé et al., 2019; Sucu et al., 2021), whilst some quantified microbial (Chhipi-Shrestha
    et al., 2017) and ecological risks (Liu et al., 2020). In most cases, circularity
    indicators were combined with environmental KPI sets, including water reuse (Eseoglu
    et al., 2022; Lizot et al., 2021), resource or product recovery potential (Chrispim
    et al., 2020; Renfrew et al., 2022), and material circularity (Palma-Heredia et
    al., 2020). Lastly, technology energy consumption was one of the most commonly
    selected indicators, however, only a few DSSs consider renewable energy (Lizot
    et al., 2021), energy reduction (Durdević et al., 2020), or self-sufficiency (Palma-Heredia
    et al., 2020) dimensions. From this it is clear that DSS developers select indicators
    from across the triple bottom line to support sustainable performance, but there
    is a gap in terms of facilitating sustainability targets and circularity assessments.
    Few KPIs are explicitly selected to quantify progress towards the high-level water
    sector targets of Section 2.1 by failing to link indicator selection with targets
    such as GHG reduction, phosphorus recovery, or energy neutrality. This even includes
    those DSSs with the aim of selecting technologies for sustainable and circular
    actions, such as water reuse or energy recovery. 3.3. Indicator categorisation
    Often criteria or indicators are categorised to show user assessment priorities
    and indicate potential benefits or impacts of selected technologies. Table 1 defines
    the DSSs categories employed to separate indicators and shows that twenty of the
    thirty-one DSSs utilise discrete sustainability pillars. The most popular combination
    uses four environmental, economic, social, and technical (assumed interchangeable
    with functional, operational, or resilience) categories. Nine DSSs used a combination
    of other categories defined by the developers, and some did use sustainability
    pillars, however, they were combined to create hybrid socio-economic or -environmental
    categories. Many DSSs also utilise circularity KPIs, however, as mentioned in
    Section 3.2 they are categorised as environmental indicators. This is worrying
    as enhancing the circularity of wastewater resources does not directly correspond
    to improved environmental performance. This leads to a significant gap in decision
    maker knowledge as circularity indicators are being used to as a substitute for
    sustainability impacts. Therefore, DSSs with circularity objectives, such as resource
    recovery, need standardised assessments that use CE indicators to evidence enhanced
    resource circularity, supported by sustainability analysis to quantify wider benefits.
    This will facilitate technology selection that simultaneously meet the water sector
    sustainability and circularity targets detailed in the European Green Deal and
    CEAP. Some DSS developers created hybrid categories including socio-economic (Đurđević
    et al., 2020) and socio-environmental (Silva Junior et al., 2022), or combined
    environmental and technical categories together (Chrispim et al., 2020). This
    suggests authors may be unsure as to which categories some indicators belong.
    This is further perpetuated by authors placing the same indicators in different
    sustainability pillar categories. For example, WWT technology removal efficiencies
    have been placed in environmental sustainability (Liu et al., 2020; Lizot et al.,
    2021; Molinos-Senante et al., 2014) and technical categories (Eseoglu et al.,
    2022; Silva Junior et al., 2022). This may explain the increase in popularity
    of using the four pillars of sustainability for categorisation in recent years,
    as it enables delineation of operational and environmental KPIs, highlighting
    the desire of decision makers to understand the environmental impacts of potential
    technologies more clearly. However, this seems to result in some confusion regarding
    the objectives of certain indicators, such as GHG/carbon footprint, as Đurđević
    et al. (2020) defines this as a technical indicator, whereas Lizot et al. (2021)
    utilises it as an indicator of environmental performance. Similarly, odour and
    noise indicators are placed in both environmental (Sucu et al., 2021) and more
    commonly social categories (Eseoglu et al., 2022; Lizot et al., 2021; Molinos-Senante
    et al., 2014). These differences evidence the need to enhance sustainability/circularity
    assessment knowledge and develop standardised methods for KPI selection and categorisation.
    The popularity of indicator categorisation using sustainability pillars has led
    to some DSS developers using this method even when their defined aims do not refer
    to sustainable technology selection. To combat this, some authors generated their
    own indicator categorisation strategies. Fetanat et al. (2021) developed indicator
    categories using the water-energy-food nexus framework to view wastewater as a
    renewable energy source, which aligns with the DSS goal to prioritise energy recovery
    from WWT. Palma-Heredia et al. (2020) created an indicator hierarchy depending
    on the scale of the application, therefore allowing decision makers at regional,
    WWTP, and operational levels to prioritise certain indicators. Although these
    categorisation methods are not as established in literature as sustainability
    pillars, developing indicator categories which consider DSS goals may be a more
    effective way for users to understand the indicators required to achieve their
    aims, especially whenever sustainable technology selection is not the objective.
    However, it can be concluded there is confusion when categorising selected indicators
    and how this activity aligns DSS outcomes with decision maker goals. 3.4. Indicator
    weighting Weighting of indicators is a critical stage for DSS users, as it enables
    them to prioritise or mitigate criteria depending on their objectives. Therefore,
    the frequency of each technique used by DSS developers for indicator weighting
    is provided in Fig. 4. The MCA discussed are those currently employed by water
    sector DSSs and does not reflect best practices for multi-attribute decision making.

    Fig. 4. Methods used to weight indicators for MCDM technology selection DSSs.
    It is common for indicators to be weighted according to the DSS user, and then
    a weighted summation is simply calculated to create a composite indicator used
    to analyse technologies. Garrido-Baserba et al. (2015) and Palma-Heredia et al.
    (2020) develop DSS weights for indicators that are predetermined and fixed, and
    given equal weighting respectively. Although this simplifies DSS usage, this weighting
    system is not recommended as it does not provide users with the ability to tailor
    KPI impacts to reflect their goals, which can be viewed as undermining the principles
    of MCDM. Another method commonly employed by DSS developers is to allow users
    to define weights themselves, (Castillo et al., 2016; Chhipi-Shrestha et al.,
    2017; Južnič-Zonta et al., 2022; Oertlé et al., 2019; Renfrew et al., 2022; Silva
    Junior et al., 2022; Sucu et al., 2021), however, DSS users can be faced with
    >20 indicators so assigning weights without a structured methodology of comparing
    indicators can lead to inconsistencies during analysis. This can result in indicator
    weightings that do not align adequately with aims and lead to bias in the assessment.
    Therefore, techniques are employed by DSS developers enabling structured analysis
    of indicators using opinions of experts and stakeholders. The analytical hierarchy
    process (AHP) is the most common weighting method used by reviewed DSSs with eleven.
    AHP was proposed by Saaty (1987) for decision making influenced by multiple independent
    factors (Liu et al., 2020). It investigates the relationship between criteria
    to create a hierarchy from which they can be prioritised (Eseoglu et al., 2022),
    often utilising external experts and stakeholders to create pair-wise comparisons.
    Therefore, many DSSs reviewed use standard AHP for weighting indicators (Đurđević
    et al., 2020; Gherghel et al., 2020; Jiean Ling et al., 2021a; Lizot et al., 2021;
    Molinos-Senante et al., 2014; Nkuna et al., 2022). However, Ling et al., 2021a,
    Ling et al., 2021b reported rarely seeing extreme scores on the judgement scale,
    and when the full scale was used the threshold consistency ratio (compares the
    weighting matrix against a random matrix, acceptable value of 0.1) is often not
    achieved. To overcome the uncertainty due to imprecise human judgements or ambiguity,
    fuzzy logic is implemented (Eseoglu et al., 2022). Many DSSs employ fuzzy-AHP
    weighting (An et al., 2018; Büyüközkan and Tüfekçi, 2021; Eseoglu et al., 2022;
    Liu et al., 2020; Sadr et al., 2018), providing a structured method of indicator
    weighting whilst mitigating inconsistencies of human thinking. Apart from AHP,
    DSS developers integrated a variety of weighting methods (Ali et al., 2020; Attri
    et al., 2022; de Almeida et al., 2022; Fetanat et al., 2021; Leoneti et al., 2022).
    Arroyo and Molinos-Senante (2018) implement Choosing-By-Advantages (CBA), citing
    several improvements over AHP including that it does not assume linear trade-offs
    between criteria. CBA encourages DSS users to understand the differences between
    criteria and assesses the importance of these differences, as supposed to AHP
    which can create conflicting questions. The Best-Worst Method (BWM) used by Liu
    and Ren (2022) and Salamirad et al. (2023) provides a simpler weighting step for
    decision makers as the number of comparisons is reduced, improving the consistency
    ratio of results and removing much of the uncertainty during pairwise comparisons.
    Srivastava and Singh (2022) simplify weighting even further by employing the Full
    Consistency Method, minimising the number of comparisons to achieve consistent
    results. Lastly, some DSS developers recommend the use of ‘experts’ without actually
    defining whom this might include (Attri et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2020), collecting
    opinions from stakeholders with little knowledge of the investigated system or
    local area, leading to inconsistent results. Whereas Eseoglu et al. (2022) utilises
    expert opinions from every stage of WWT including design, construction and operation
    engineers, and Gherghel et al. (2020) acknowledges the viewpoints of stakeholders
    from six different specialities, such as political, environmental, and plant operator
    stakeholders to ensure the holistic collection of viewpoints. Therefore, stakeholders
    with a range of expertise that understand local factors for indicator weighting
    should be used to reduce bias and inconsistency. Generally, the majority of DSSs
    in this study rely on AHP to weight criteria, which is corroborated by other reviews
    in the area (Kozłowska, 2022; Zolghadr-Asli et al., 2021), potentially incorporating
    high levels of uncertainty. Therefore, to ensure better indicator utilisation
    fuzzification and consultation of relevant experts can be used to reduce uncertainty.
    Additionally, methods recommended in literature, not utilised by the water sector
    DSSs reviewed, to mitigate weighting procedure errors are the entropy method for
    objective weight assignment or analytical network process (ANP) to account for
    correlations between criteria (Zolghadr-Asli et al., 2021). 3.5. Indicator scoring
    A range of methods to score assessment indicators have been utilised due to the
    variety of scales and units of indicator results, and often the mix of quantitative
    and qualitative indicators selected. Linguistic (such as very bad to very good)
    or numerical (can be from 0 up to 10) series are commonly integrated to normalise
    results enabling their combination. Several DSSs rely on the experts used for
    indicator weighting to assign numerical ratings directly based on their opinion
    (Đurđević et al., 2020; Jiean Ling et al., 2021a; Renfrew et al., 2022), usually
    when there is lack of empirical data (Jiean Ling et al., 2021a). Alternatively,
    Fetanat et al. (2021) relied on linguistic terms to rate technology alternatives
    as the indicators selected were immeasurable (such as energy security availability).
    Literature searches were used to establish numeric ranges of indicator results
    for each technology assessed (Attri et al., 2022). Silva Junior et al. (2022)
    collected data from technical-scientific literature relevant to case study location
    and assigned the final result by calculating the mean of the data range found.
    Before combination of indicator results, they were normalised to a value between
    0 and 1 using the lowest and highest value observed for each parameter. Rather
    than quantitatively normalising values collected from literature, Liu and Ren
    (2022) utilised a linguistic scale of five from very good to very poor, whilst
    Lizot et al. (2021) created ranges for each indicator to assign a numeric value
    to normalise quantitative indicator scores. Lastly, a common method for assigning
    scores to indicators is to directly quantify results (except for the indicators
    which are inherently qualitative). It was observed that most environmental and
    economic indicators were quantifiable, whilst technical and social indicators
    were qualitatively scored (Castillo et al., 2016; Leoneti et al., 2022; Liu and
    Ren, 2022; Molinos-Senante et al., 2014). Quantitative calculation of each indicator
    investigating technology performance is recommended, as it incorporates specific
    details and local factors of the case study. Relying on the judgement of DSS users
    or external experts enables uncertainty through the ambiguity or bias of human
    decision making to incorrectly score technologies. Furthermore, the use of values
    extracted from literature can mitigate the influence of local factors which can
    be pertinent for economic and technical indicators. Of course, when using qualitative
    indicators to investigate social aspects, local stakeholder views should be used
    to score technologies, due to their greater understanding of potential impacts
    in a given region. 3.6. Ranking The final step is to rank technologies for selecting
    the technology which supposedly best meets user requirements. Palma-Heredia et
    al. (2020) presents KPI results and recommends the DSS user to complete pairwise
    comparisons for technology selection. Although this is a simple method of completing
    the final ranking, extensive indicator lists create complexity and inconsistencies
    in user judgement. Therefore, the most common method of technology ranking employed
    by DSS developers is to create a composite indicator using the weighted sum method
    (Castillo et al., 2016; de Almeida et al., 2022; Garrido-Baserba et al., 2015;
    Gherghel et al., 2020; Liu and Ren, 2022; Molinos-Senante et al., 2014). This
    synthesises indicator scores and their corresponding weights into a single performance
    index used to rank and select technologies (Jiean Ling et al., 2021a). In the
    cases where multiple experts or stakeholders are used to weight or score assessment
    indicators, systematic analysis of results is needed to rank and select technologies.
    The technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS)
    is commonly coupled with AHP. TOPSIS selects the best alternative based on the
    shortest distance to the ideal solution and the farthest distance from the negative-ideal
    solution in geometric terms (Južnič-Zonta et al., 2022), to intensify the correctness
    and validate selection of the most appropriate technology (Nkuna et al., 2022).
    When fuzzification of data has occurred during indicator weighting, to improve
    the robustness of outcomes, this can be continued to complete fuzzy-TOPSIS (Attri
    et al., 2022; Büyüközkan and Tüfekçi, 2021; Eseoglu et al., 2022; Liu et al.,
    2020; Sadr et al., 2018). Another method employed to overcome the uncertainty
    of comparative analysis, is fuzzy-VIKOR as used by Ali et al. (2020), which utilises
    positive and negative characteristics to define compromises when conflicting views
    cause issues with decision making. This is achieved by calculating three variables
    to establish the summation and maximum distance from the best value, which are
    then combined to calculate an overall score. Alternatively, Leoneti et al. (2022)
    implements game theory to determine the preferred option from the list of acceptable
    outcomes, selecting the technology that maximises the Nash equilibria social welfare
    function. Lastly, Fetanat et al. (2021) utilised the linear assignment method
    (LAM) to rank technologies for energy recovery from WWTs. This method is chosen
    as it ranks alternatives according to conflicting criteria, by analysing the trade-offs
    between the ranking of each indicator for each technology. Therefore, LAM may
    be beneficial as wastewater and sewage sludge treatment shifts to prioritise other
    functions, such as resource recovery or water reuse. Studies in this area agree
    that TOPSIS is the most common ranking procedure (Štilić and Puška, 2023), however,
    best practice depends on the scenario of application. Methods such as PROMETHEE
    and ELECTRE are suited to handle conflicting stakeholder priorities (Štilić and
    Puška, 2023), whereas fuzzy logic and use of experts from as many specialities
    as possible should be used to tackle subjective ranking issues (Garcia-Garcia,
    2022). 3.7. Uncertainty There are various types of uncertainty that exist in MCDM
    that can arise at each step of DSS utilisation resulting from: variation, ambiguity,
    and incomplete preferences of human inputs; lack of system, parameter, data, external
    factor, or model knowledge; and prediction of outcomes or future events (climatic
    or socio-economic changes) (Walling and Vaneeckhaute, 2020). There are many methods
    to deal with MCDM uncertainty, one being fuzzification of scoring, weighting,
    and ranking procedures reliant on human judgement, as previously discussed in
    3.4 Indicator weighting, 3.5 Indicator scoring, 3.6 Ranking. Alternatively, sensitivity
    analysis is able to provide decision makers with insights into the uncertainty
    resulting from erroneous modelling of the assessed system or potential/future
    scenarios. Scenario investigation is a widely applied method of sensitivity analysis,
    in which MCDM indicator weighting is altered to reflect different viewpoints or
    future situations. For example, Molinos-Senante et al. (2014) and Salamirad et
    al. (2023) conducted scenario analysis by favourably weighting environmental,
    economic, and social KPIs in turn, validating the selected technology (constructed
    wetlands and integrated fixed-film activated sludge respectively) still ranked
    highest under alternative weighting schemes. Alternatively, Renfrew et al. (2022)
    improved the robustness of technology selection by weighting KPIs based on potential
    future scenarios, including legislative changes for emissions compliance and carbon
    footprint reduction, and selecting technologies based on their average performance
    across the scenarios. Furthermore, global sensitivity analysis (GSA) was utilised
    to verify that technology ranking is robust to fluctuating inputs over a ±10 %
    range and investigate which parameter''s uncertainty have the largest impact on
    MCDM outcomes, educating future assessments (Renfrew et al., 2022). Lastly, Južnič-Zonta
    et al. (2022) aimed to use Monte-Carlo (MC) simulations to overcome probabilistic
    uncertainty of bio-chemical modelling processes to configure design parameters,
    before technology ranking is calculated and verified over each iteration (however
    this was not included in case study). Therefore, if potential errors are likely
    to be introduced by MCDM structure or case study that impact outcomes, then sensitivity
    analysis (scenario or global) should be used to validate the robustness of DSS
    results. 3.8. Recommendations As discussed, there are already many reviews of
    DSS typologies in the literature, therefore, the review focuses on how indicator
    usage can be improved based on the methods currently implemented for WWTP technology
    selection. Therefore, following the review of thirty-one MCDM DSSs final recommendations
    and comments are provided in Table 2. Unfortunately, 3.2 Indicator selection,
    3.3 Indicator categorisation highlight the significant gap related to the utilisation
    of circularity and sustainability indicators, mainly that circularity aspects
    are used to investigate environmental performance and the lack of alignment with
    water sector goals reported as part of European Green Deal and CEAP. Additionally,
    WWTP DSSs still rely on user defined weighting, scoring, and ranking procedures,
    or structured methods, such as AHP and TOPSIS, which have issues with introducing
    uncertainty to the assessment. Generally, decision making in the water sector
    is still some distance from standardisation and harmonisation of sustainability
    and circularity assessments. Table 2. Summary of issues, recommendations, and
    beneficial outcomes related to the reviewed MCDM technology selection DSSs. Issue
    Recommendation Outcome Few DSSs provide a clear definition of aims or goals Defining
    the goal and scope of the assessment should become common practice, as the first
    step of DSS development or application Help decision makers understand the desired
    outcome of DSS utilisation Rigorous indicator selection is often overlooked by
    DSS developers and do not consider high level water sector goals Utilise participatory
    methods to incorporate local stakeholder, business (water utility), and regional/governmental
    objectives Technology selection using KPIs that adequately reflects desired results
    and facilitate sector transformation Indicator categorisation is often unclear
    resulting in inconsistencies across DSSs, mitigating circularity objectives Use
    categorises that reflect the intentions of the DSS, helping to create more robust
    weighting strategies and consider CE targets of the water sector Help to select
    and group relevant indicators, such as using sustainability pillars when selecting
    sustainable technologies, and mitigate the alignment of CE metrics with sustainability
    impacts Expert or user defined weighting schemes can lead to a lack of local factor
    consideration Stakeholders with an understanding of the local area from a range
    of job roles should be used for indicator weighting Ensures that DSSs select technology
    that will meet the local demands in each scenario of application and reduce uncertainty
    of results Unstructured or subjective weighting and ranking methods can lead to
    uncertain outcomes Consider the specific issues of each DSS application to decide
    which method should be used to reduce uncertainty, such as entropy methods to
    enhance the objectivity of weighting, and either fuzzy logic to reduce human error
    or PROMETHEE/ELECTRE to overcome conflicting priorities during ranking Remove
    the inconsistency and reduce uncertainty that can arise when human inputs are
    used to weight and rank indicators There is little critical analysis of final
    technology selection in relation to decision maker goals Techniques such as sensitivity
    analysis should be applied to investigate DSS outcomes Ensure that the method
    is consistent across alternative scenarios, enhancing robustness of final technology
    selection It is worth noting that analysis of DSS case studies showed that economic
    indicators were commonly prioritised during the weighting stages (Eseoglu et al.,
    2022; Liu et al., 2020; Lizot et al., 2021; Sadr et al., 2018). The CBA method
    employed by Arroyo and Molinos-Senante (2018) excluded economic indicators during
    the initial assessment, prioritising environmental and social factors, as monetary
    resources available are usually the constraint for any project. Environmental
    and social indicator results are then plotted against cost to facilitate the selection
    of the best technology option. Authors highlight the impacts of this by comparing
    AHP with CBA and showed that by considering economic factors alongside environmental
    and social indicators, unfavourable impacts were offset by low capital and operating
    costs. Therefore, as governments demand improved environmental and social performance
    of WWT in the coming years, to achieve targets such as net zero, the exclusion
    of economic indicators from initial assessment may be favoured. 4. Multi-objective
    optimisation control Following the selection of technologies, another type of
    DSS is needed for multi-objective optimisation of WWTP process operation and control.
    It is necessary to conduct distinct analysis of these DSS types as they are utilised
    differently by decision makers. Therefore, alternative methods and indicators
    are required, as it was seen that technology selection DSSs focus on sustainability
    KPIs whereas operational optimisation DSSs target cost and regulatory (effluent
    quality) aspects. Table 3 summarises the multi-objective process optimisation
    WWTP DSSs collected from literature, resulting in the review of twenty-six articles.

    Optimal control of wastewater treatment process BSM1 EC and EQI Table 3 shows
    an increase in the number of publications in this area, growing from four in 2018
    to seven in 2022 which coincides with the availability of Benchmark Simulation
    Model (BSM) 1 and BSM2 (IWA, 2018) for testing WWTP control strategies. Some authors
    have recently published multiple papers in this area, testing different algorithms
    to find the optimal control strategy on the same simulation platform. DSSs were
    categorised depending on their ability to optimise the control of process operation
    dynamically (respond to changes in real-time) or statically (user defined inputs
    followed by KPI calculation). Most DSSs are dynamic, which corresponds with use
    of BSMs as time series data across three weather conditions is available for simulation
    testing (IWA, 2018). Generally, DSS aims were stated in clearer terms than those
    for technology selection, often stating which performance parameters or KPIs are
    targeted for optimisation. Most DSSs were not applied to real case studies and
    instead utilised BSMs due to the complexity and non-linearity of WWTP modelling.
    This reliance results in little variation of KPIs selected (type or number), as
    BSMs have predefined indicators related to effluent quality and energy consumption/cost.
    As shown in Fig. 5, the BSM1 plant is a 5-compartment activated sludge reactor
    modelled using ASM1, with configuration facilitating nitrification-denitrification
    for biological nitrogen removal. The model utilises PI controllers to control
    the dissolved oxygen (DO) level by manipulating the oxygen transfer coefficient,
    and nitrate level setpoints, by changing the internal recycle rate in the fifth
    and second compartments respectively (IWA, 2018). The performance assessment of
    the plant is based on two main KPIs; the effluent quality index (EQI) and overall
    cost index (OCI). The EQI is the weighted sum (weightings from literature) of
    effluent contaminant TSS, COD, BOD, Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN), and nitrate (NO).
    The OCI combines cost factors of sludge production, aeration energy, pumping energy,
    mixing energy, and external carbon consumption (Alex et al., 2018). BSM2 utilises
    the same wastewater treatment process, with the addition of sludge anaerobic digestion
    to the balance heat energy required and energy generated from methane production.
    The number of effluent limit violations and duration must be reported, meaning
    operation is constrained by discharge limits of NH4 ≤4 mg/l; TN ≤18 mg/l; TSS
    ≤30 mg/l; BOD ≤10 mg/l; COD ≤100 mg/l (Alex et al., 2018). Download : Download

    flow diagram and control systems based on a figure from the IWA (2018) where Q
    is the flowrate, S is the set point, PI is the controller, and KLa is the transfer
    coefficient. 4.1. DSS goals In Section 3 it was revealed that MCDM technology
    selection DSS aims are too generic, meaning it is difficult to relate indicator
    selection to desired outcomes. Many of the multi-objective process optimisation
    DSSs reviewed in Table 3 take the opposite approach, as twelve stated the KPIs
    targeted for optimisation in their aims. This definition enables users to clearly
    understand the outcomes that can be expected when implementing this optimisation
    technique, however, many of these DSSs relied on BSMs meaning there is little
    flexibility in the indicators utilised. Another helpful method of defining DSS
    aims for the user is to identify its specific function. For example, Borzooei
    et al. (2019) and Revollar et al. (2021) aimed to optimise the production of renewable
    energy and improve the eco-efficiency of WWTPs respectively, making it clear to
    users the reasons for implementing this DSS and selecting indicators for optimisation.
    Still, a significant number of multi-objective optimisation DSS developers use
    vague language when stating their aims. Eight DSSs aim to either optimise or improve
    performance of WWTPs, whilst three DSSs aim for sustainable operation or control
    of WWTPs, without explicitly stating which areas are targeted. Therefore, DSSs
    clearly define their aims, but few explicitly relate this to sustainability or
    circularity objectives, aiming to generally ‘optimise WWTP performance’ or improve
    conventional operation KPIs. 4.2. Static vs dynamic control Of the twenty-six
    DSSs reviewed in Table 3, six provided users with static control strategies for
    improving the operation of WWTPs, meaning the results are used by operators to
    make decisions rather than the DSS dynamically altering operation. Borzooei et
    al. (2019) created a simulation of a large-scale WWTP and altered the SRT between
    10 and 40 days, then plots the EQI and EC results to establish the optimal SRT
    for process operation. Mannina et al. (2020) goes a step further by using TOPSIS
    to optimise five operational parameters using ten KPIs and combining this with
    E-FAST sensitivity analysis to understand the influence of operating parameters
    on performance. These static DSSs allow users to observe and understand what an
    optimised system may look like, enabling them to derive and implement the WWTP
    control strategy. The remaining twenty DSSs are able to dynamically alter operation
    parameters without user interference. For example, Heo et al. (2021) uses the
    fuzzy c-mean algorithm to process and cluster influent data to predict initial
    BSM2 setpoints, a deep neural network then completes the multi-objective optimisation
    calculation for EQI, OCI, and biogas generation performance indicators, and finally
    the NSGA-II algorithm searches for the optimal setpoint of each controller. Therefore,
    the WWTP can maintain optimal performance and respond to fluctuations in influent
    composition. The use of DSSs for dynamic optimisation means that indicator selection
    must focus on KPIs that are calculated from data that is easily and reliably monitored
    over a given period. 4.3. Modelling platform Of the nineteen DSSs that dynamically
    control WWTP operation, fourteen are implemented in BSM1 without being tested
    on real processes. In most cases these DSSs are made up of two algorithms, one
    responsible for the multi-objective optimisation of KPIs (commonly a neural network)
    and another for determining the set point of controllers (such as a NSGA-II or
    AMODE algorithm (Heo et al., 2021; Ortiz-Martínez et al., 2021; Qiao et al., 2019,
    Qiao et al., 2018; Tejaswini et al., 2021)). The repeated investigation of different
    algorithm combinations is necessary to which results in the best EQI and OCI outcomes,
    and lowest controller error (Du and Peng, 2023). Two DSSs are used to control
    the operation of BSM2, enabling users to optimise operation considering biogas
    production as part of the OCI. Two DSSs are utilised for the dynamic control of
    actual processes including the work of Han et al. (2021) which runs initial tests
    on BSM1 then uses data extracted from the SCADA system of a 10,000 m3/d plant
    in Beijing, China to run experimental tests. Lastly, Dai et al. (2019) developed
    their own optimisation models, using ASM-2D to optimise a WWTP for inducing crystallisation.
    Therefore, few DSSs have been tested on real systems so may not perform as expected
    when applied at different scales or locations, especially under unexpected influent
    loadings. It is recommended that users test DSSs in real systems or on models
    that represent the specific process it will be applied to, ensuring optimisation
    reflects the operational expectations of decision makers. In the cases of static
    control, the DSSs developed usually rely on simulation software or the development
    of process models. Four DSSs used their own models which facilitated the selection
    and utilisation of less conventional KPIs, including regenerated water usage (Díaz-Madroñero
    et al., 2018), energetic self-sufficiency (Campana et al., 2021), and environmental
    impact (kg CO2eq) (Caligan et al., 2022). Two DSSs simulated WWTPs in Hydromantis''s
    GPS-X software, with configurations based on real-world processes (Chen et al.,
    2021) and fed with historic data taken from plant SCADA systems (Borzooei et al.,
    2019). Lastly, Revollar et al. (2021) specify four scenarios (fluctuating DO,
    NH4, and internal recycle setpoints) in BSM2, which enables the calculation of
    eco-efficiency indicators for comparing control strategies. Therefore, static
    control systems are able to optimise a greater variety of KPIs, like the EQI and
    OCI, and operational parameters, including solids retention time (Borzooei et
    al., 2019; Mannina et al., 2020) or process flowrates (Caligan et al., 2022; Revollar
    et al., 2021). 4.4. Indicators selected The reliance of DSS developers on BSM
    platforms results in little variability of selected indicators. In fact, Table
    3 shows eighteen reviewed DSSs used only the inbuilt indicators of BSMs, including
    EQI, OCI, or its sub indicators (pumping, aeration, and total energy consumption).
    Although indicators are fixed in the platform, little justification or reasoning
    for selecting these indicators is given by DSS or BSM sources, except that they
    cover both economic and environmental impacts (Li et al., 2021), reflect the operational
    state of the WWTP, and can evaluate process performance (Han et al., 2022a). EQI
    and OCI indicators reflect the traditional goals of water related literature and
    regulations, such as for human health protection and cost functions, that will
    always be important to maintain WWTP performance. However, modern water sector
    targets relate to areas such as GHG emissions and resource recovery, therefore,
    expansion to include KPIs that reflect these goals is recommended for further
    development of BSMs. This is needed as inclusion of sustainability and circularity
    dimensions would enable users to optimise WWTP operation considering the wider
    impacts to stakeholders and achieve targets defined in Section 2.1, such as those
    defined in the CEAP. Subsequently, the eight remaining DSSs developed integrated
    other indicators to optimise process operation considering impacts other than
    cost and effluent quality. Three DSSs calculate process GHGs, including Mannina
    et al. (2020) that consider a combination of CO2 and N2O emissions, direct and
    indirect GHGs, and air-EQI to understand how MBR operational parameters impact
    emissions. Caligan et al. (2022) also considered GHGs emissions and compared this
    with cost functions, whilst Chen et al. (2021) conducted full LCC and LCA to investigate
    the impact of indicator prioritisation on a 10,000 PE WWTP. Other DSSs selected
    indicators to investigate a specific function of a WWTP, namely freshwater and
    regenerated water use (Díaz-Madroñero et al., 2018), eco-efficiency (Revollar
    et al., 2021), treatment time reduction (Fox et al., 2022), and energetic self-sufficiency
    (Campana et al., 2021). These indicators align better with modern water sector
    sustainability goals compared with EQI and OCI indicators. However, they all employed
    self-selection methods and generally circularity indicators were mitigated from
    optimisation DSSs, showing this is yet to become a priority of WWTP operators.
    4.5. Indicator prioritisation Again, there is a difference between static and
    dynamic DSS indicators in how they are analysed to produce the optimal solution.
    The majority of dynamic calculations aim to minimise the performance indicators
    selected, including BSMs trying to minimise both EQI and OCI (or energy consumption).
    This results in an optimisation problem (Heo et al., 2021) since decreasing one
    of these KPIs increases the other, for example greater removal efficiency requires
    additional energy consumption from aeration and recirculation pumping. Therefore,
    DSS algorithms must cope with KPI trade-offs, known Pareto sets, which derives
    a sub-optimal solution for the chosen KPIs but establishes that both results are
    better than the rest of the potential outcomes in the search space (Qiao et al.,
    2018). Fox et al. (2022) developed one of the only dynamic optimisation DSSs to
    employ a weighting method, with the hope of considering site-specific requirements.
    Local plant operators assigned weights, which were combined with KPI result rankings
    to decide on the soft sensors that produces the best control strategy. In previous
    years it was common to weight KPIs to create a single objective optimisation (Niu
    et al., 2022), however, this necessitates real-time supervision by plant operators
    to achieve optimal control (Han et al., 2014). Of the static DSSs, three utilise
    KPI weighting to achieve the optimal solution. Díaz-Madroñero et al. (2018) used
    fuzzy goal programming to incorporate decision maker preferences and trade-offs
    between objective functions. Alternatively, Chen et al. (2021) normalises LCA
    impact indicator results and uses weights defined in literature, whilst Mannina
    et al. (2020) weights all ten objective functions selected equally. The use of
    decision maker weighting strategies is recommended, as it enables the goals of
    local stakeholders to be integrated within optimisation outcomes. Lastly, some
    DSS developers did not provide a method for selecting the optimal strategy, leaving
    it to the interpretation of the user to compare KPI results (Revollar et al.,
    2021), such as Borzooei et al. (2019) which relies on optimisation curves showing
    EQI vs OCI to select the best operational SRT parameter. Although weighting strategies
    are useful, the dynamic optimisation of KPIs is now accepted as best practice
    to enable automatic, supervisory control of plants, placing greater emphasis on
    proper selection of KPIs to reflect decision maker needs during WWTP operation.
    4.6. Error and uncertainty These DSSs aim to provide an optimised control strategy
    for the operation of WWTPs, however, alternative controllers, KPIs, or conditions
    may result in differing performance. Therefore, it is critical to test the sensitivity
    of DSS performance on results. One of the main strategies employed was to compare
    the optimised KPI results with alternative controller algorithms, to ensure the
    adopted method achieves the best performance. Controller performance metrics including
    the Integral of Absolute Error (IAE) (no error weighting), Integral of Squared
    Error (ISE) (penalises larger errors), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) were
    utilised. In fact, six DSSs compare the controller algorithm deployed using the
    IAE with other algorithms (Han et al., 2022a, Han et al., 2021; Li et al., 2022;
    Qiao et al., 2019, Qiao et al., 2018; Xie et al., 2022), one utilised both ISE
    and IAE for comparison (Han et al., 2018), and another implemented RSME (Qiao
    and Zhou, 2018) to investigate whether the method used results in the lowest error.
    Additionally, six DSSs compared controller algorithms using KPI results only (Han
    et al., 2022b; Li et al., 2021; Mannina et al., 2020; Niu et al., 2022; Pisa et
    al., 2019; Zhou and Qiao, 2019), which is a useful exercise to reassure the user
    their DSS will produce the best outcomes. However, investigating errors is important
    as it indicates the size and longevity of potential disruptions to system performance.
    Multi-objective optimisation DSSs utilise similar approaches to those discussed
    in Section 3.7 for MCDM for uncertainty analysis. For example, the DSS developed
    by Caligan et al. (2022) formulated scenarios to investigate the impacts of events
    that WWTP operators may face, including how the fluctuation of biofuel prices,
    inlet wastewater quality, and requirements for wastewater and sludge disposal,
    impact on cost and GHG emission KPIs. Ortiz-Martínez et al. (2021) created scenarios
    simulating lack of aeration due to process error and mitigation of flow recirculation
    due to maintenance, to investigate the effect on process optimisation. Alternatively,
    some authors investigated optimisation strategies through prioritisation of certain
    indicators to see how the system responds. DSSs were tested by optimising either
    the environmental (i.e. EQI) or economic (i.e. OCI) KPI, and comparing this with
    when both are optimised (Chen et al., 2021; Tejaswini et al., 2021). Mult-objective
    optimisation DSSs have other inherent uncertainties to deal with when modelling
    WWTP systems, such as climatic changes and fluctuating wastewater concentration
    (Chen et al., 2018). DSS developers tackled this uncertainty by investigating
    the effects of the wastewater influent on performance using fluctuation of the
    TKN/COD inlet ratio (Heo et al., 2021) and fuzzification of inlet composition
    (Díaz-Madroñero et al., 2018). However, further uncertainty analysis is recommended
    to test how WWTP optimisation models respond to external factors. MC simulations
    are commonly used for modelling input uncertainty as different probability distributions
    (normal, parametric etc.) can be selected depending on error attributes and case
    study characteristics (Haag et al., 2019). Testing the uncertainty of DSS performance
    is critical and for a complete study it is recommended to make comparisons in
    KPI performance and controller error with other systems, and investigate fluctuations
    to influent load and process operation to ensure the DSS will meet all user expectations
    when deployed at a real WWTP. 4.7. Recommendations Following the review of twenty-six
    multi-objective DSSs for optimisation of WWTP process operation, some final recommendations
    and comments are provided in Table 4. However, it can again be concluded that
    although these DSSs aim to optimise WWTP performance there is little attention
    given to how this results in the indicators selected for optimisation, nor an
    explanation of how subsequent operation aligns with sustainability aims, and mitigate
    circularity dimensions entirely. Table 4. Summary of issues, recommendations,
    and beneficial outcomes related to the reviewed wastewater treatment multi-objective
    process optimisation DSSs. Issue Recommendation Outcome Few DSSs are applied to
    real WWTP systems, mitigating the impacts of local climate and influent composition
    Test DSSs in realistic process models or trial them in real-world systems User
    achieves the expected performance when DSS is applied to their system Although
    KPI selection is fixed for many of the DSSs reviewed, rigorous indicator selection
    is often overlooked Develop process models that utilise KPIs considering local
    stakeholder and business objectives for WWTP optimisation, rather than depending
    on those integrated within BSMs DSS will optimise WWTP in a way that generates
    desired benefits for stakeholders Focussing on EQI and OCI (or energy consumption)
    KPIs provides a narrow view of ‘optimal’ or ‘sustainable’ WWTP performance Expansion
    of indicators to include environmental, social, circularity, and technical aspects
    Align WWTP operation with modern sustainability and circularity aims of the water
    sector Dynamic control and optimisation of WWTPs aligns better with the water
    sector''s digitisation goals, mitigating plant operator decision making capabilities
    Implement robust indicator selection to ensure optimal performance facilitates
    decision maker goals at a plant level Responsive systems that optimise performance
    in terms of selected KPIs, rather than relying on intuitive decision making of
    operators Many DSSs did not investigate the performance of controller algorithms
    using appropriate metrics IAE and ISE are recommended for understanding the response
    of the selected algorithm to process alterations, especially as dynamic operation
    of WWTPs evolves Better understanding of how the investigated WWTP will respond
    to external stressors 5. Future work 5.1. Indicator selection Unfortunately, it
    has been shown that the indicators utilised by most wastewater DSSs do not align
    with water sector sustainability and circularity targets. Currently, there is
    a lack of standardised assessment methodologies that combine circularity and sustainability
    dimensions, and confusion due to the excess of indicators developed (Valls-Val
    et al., 2022). Most methods rely on the user cherry picking indicators from a
    predetermined list, therefore, when an organisation adopts an innovative activity
    it can result in redundant indicator selection and efforts or resources being
    allocated incorrectly (Peral et al., 2017). There are additional difficulties
    to consider in the water sector, particularly for circularity assessments, as
    the main focus until now has been enhancing the performance of technical systems.
    For example, processes that safely return biotic and water resources to the environment
    can be seen as effective waste management (Chojnacka et al., 2020), whereas this
    can occur during landfilling or incineration for abiotic resources which are non-circular
    actions, meaning many indicators are not appropriate. This means it is currently
    very difficult to assess wastewater systems for the selection and optimisation
    of technology that facilitates decision maker goals. It has been shown in the
    literature, and this review, that CE indicators have been aligned with sustainability
    dimensions to validate decision making (Harris et al., 2021), whilst the opposite
    can be said when using LCA impacts to evidence enhanced circularity (Corona et
    al., 2019). Therefore, there is a large knowledge gap regarding how circularity
    and sustainability indicators can be combined. Overcoming this issue requires
    the development of methods that assess the circularity of resource flows and is
    supported using wider sustainability analysis to quantify economic, environmental,
    and social benefits. Only then can wastewater decision making facilitate governmental
    circularity and sustainability targets, whilst maintaining WWTP performance, and
    meeting the customer expectations. 5.2. Data Inefficient use of data is one of
    the main problems in plant management which many WWTPs struggle to solve. The
    WWT process is complicated and decentralised, so data is scattered, and managers
    can struggle to supervise the whole plant leading to poor management. The water
    industry is still developing data collection, management, analytics, and controls
    to more effectively use this data to inform decision making across all management
    and operational functions (Corominas et al., 2018). As a result, much of this
    data is relatively untapped to support decisions that would enable higher levels
    of performance and control. Subsequently, online optimisation of WWTP control
    has not been widely applied to real-world systems, due to the complex, non-linear
    behaviour of biological WWT systems (increasing the computational requirements),
    lack of visualisation techniques, and low-quality sensor measurements (Matheri
    et al., 2022). Types of advanced control known as model predictive controllers,
    use data-driven techniques for early correction of process operation to reduce
    process faults and therefore costly downtime, effluent violations, and resource
    consumption (Ntalaperas et al., 2022). The combination of this with effectively
    constructed multi-objective optimisation DSSs results in powerful and desirable
    tools for the water sector to achieve its goals. Finally, the use of data-driven
    techniques can also be extended to improve the selection of indicators, including
    the use of techniques combined with expert knowledge, to find precise KPIs for
    monitoring specific strategic goals. This would enable the differentiation between
    performance (lead) and result (lag) indicators, and create numeric thresholds
    and benchmarks (del Mar Roldán-García et al., 2021), providing more knowledge
    for decision making purposes. 5.3. Uncertainty There are many levels of uncertainty
    associated with WWTP DSSs, namely model structure (misrepresented boundaries,
    inaccuracy of construction, subjective judgement, and mitigation of important
    mechanisms), data (quality, processing, measurement error, and reliability), and
    relationship with the natural environment (knowledge gaps, dynamic system, and
    uncertain future) (Uusitalo et al., 2015; Walling and Vaneeckhaute, 2020). It
    is important to map the source and magnitude of uncertainty in DSSs, for which
    many techniques have been discussed in 3 Technology selection DSSs, 4 Multi-objective
    optimisation control, however, uncertainty is still recognised and treated differently
    by decision makers in the water sector. Even though the water sector has additional
    complexities that result from its strong relationship and dependency with the
    natural environment, a standardised methodology to identify, quantify, reduce,
    and report uncertainty to support decision making is still missing (Walling and
    Vaneeckhaute, 2020). A large number of techniques have been implemented to reduce
    uncertainty, depending on the MCDM method or model utilised, including the use
    of expert assessments, sensitivity analysis (scenario, GSA, or MC based), model
    emulators (Gaussian processes), deterministic models (temporal and spatial variability),
    and heterogeneous data assimilation (meteorological and hydrological) (Pelissari
    et al., 2021; Uusitalo et al., 2015). Consideration of future climate impacts
    is particularly challenging for water decision makers, when making operational
    decisions in the face of uncertain conditions. In this case, stochastic modelling
    frameworks and decision tree approaches are recommended to assign future conditions
    a probability of occurrence (Horne et al., 2016). Furthermore, to achieve more
    standardised protocols these methods must be aligned with the type and magnitude
    of uncertainties, ensuring that resultant decisions are with acceptable ranges,
    thereby permitting dissemination. Identifying uncertainties that have the greatest
    impact on results will help water sector decision makers create knowledge bases
    with which to refine future studies and models (Horne et al., 2016). 6. Conclusions
    WWTP decision makers face stricter regulations regarding human health, environmental
    protection, and emissions reduction, meaning they must optimise performance and
    replace infrastructure, whilst maintaining positive economic performance. This
    creates complex multi-objective problems when operating and selecting technologies
    for improving WWTPs, meaning many DSSs have been developed for the water sector.
    Currently, there is a mismatch in terms of the decision maker goals and KPIs selected
    for DSSs, so water sector objectives at a European level were summarised. The
    regulation and action plans from the European Commission highlight their recent
    ambition for greater levels or sustainability, circularity, and environmental
    and human health protection. Following this, DSS literature was reviewed and showed
    the main function of MCDM tools was for WWT technology selection, whereas multi-objective
    optimisation DSSs focused on optimal set-point control to improve effluent and
    cost indicators. A large contrast was found regarding the aims of DSS typologies,
    as optimisation strategies tend to clearly define their goals in terms of the
    KPIs used, however, MCDM tools often use vague language making it difficult for
    users to make a connection between indicators selected and resultant outcomes.
    Considering these issues several recommendations were made to improve DSS deployment,
    such as more rigorous indicator selection protocols including participatory approaches
    and expansion of indicators sets (specifically for multi-objective optimisation),
    or greater analysis of results whether it is the use of sensitivity/uncertainty
    analysis or ISE/IAE indicators. Lastly, to facilitate the success of DSSs implementation,
    development should focus on standardised methods of indicator selection that directly
    links outcomes with decision maker goals, and the water sector''s circularity
    and sustainability targets. CRediT authorship contribution statement D. Renfrew:

  description: 'Material selection in buildings profoundly affects project success,
    encompassing durability, maintenance, customer satisfaction, production systems,
    lifecycle, usage, environment, and costs. Yet, there is a need for further research
    on indicators for choosing materials in prefabricated buildings. Therefore, this
    study’s main objective was to identify the indicators (criteria and sub-criteria)
    for selecting materials for prefabricated wooden construction and, subsequently,
    categorize these criteria and sub-criteria based on the perspective of industry
    professionals. To achieve this goal, three phases were carried out. First, a literature
    review was conducted to identify potential criteria for choosing structural and
    envelope materials in wooden prefabricated buildings. Second, a pilot survey was
    conducted in Canada and the United States to classify the priority order of the
    criteria obtained from the literature based on professionals’ opinions. Finally,
    Monte Carlo simulations were conducted with different iterations (1000, 10,000,
    and 100,000) using the data obtained from the previous phase to improve decision-making
    and classification processes. For the indicators to select materials, the literature
    review identified seven main criteria: performance properties, green materials,
    energy efficiency, circular economy, site conditions and material logistics, standards,
    and social impact. These criteria contained a total of 25 sub-criteria. The pilot
    survey data analysis demonstrated that the performance properties, site conditions
    and material logistics, and social impact criteria were consistently prioritized.
    The critical sub-criteria identified were fire resistance, watertightness, local
    availability, occupant health, and safety and protection. For the Monte Calo simulations,
    the predictions aligned with the pilot study, enhancing the robustness of the
    results.'

  explanation: This study aimed to identify and prioritize criteria and sub-criteria
    for selecting materials in prefabricated wood construction projects, with a focus
    on strategies for ensuring system reliability. Through a literature review, online
    surveys, and Monte Carlo simulations, the researchers sought to determine the
    most important factors to consider when choosing materials for these projects.

    Notes Abstract Material selection in buildings profoundly affects project success,
    encompassing durability, maintenance, customer satisfaction, production systems,
    lifecycle, usage, environment, and costs. Yet, there is a need for further research
    on indicators for choosing materials in prefabricated buildings. Therefore, this
    study’s main objective was to identify the indicators (criteria and sub-criteria)
    for selecting materials for prefabricated wooden construction and, subsequently,
    categorize these criteria and sub-criteria based on the perspective of industry
    professionals. To achieve this goal, three phases were carried out. First, a literature
    review was conducted to identify potential criteria for choosing structural and
    envelope materials in wooden prefabricated buildings. Second, a pilot survey was
    conducted in Canada and the United States to classify the priority order of the
    criteria obtained from the literature based on professionals’ opinions. Finally,
    Monte Carlo simulations were conducted with different iterations (1000, 10,000,
    and 100,000) using the data obtained from the previous phase to improve decision-making
    and classification processes. For the indicators to select materials, the literature
    review identified seven main criteria: performance properties, green materials,
    energy efficiency, circular economy, site conditions and material logistics, standards,
    and social impact. These criteria contained a total of 25 sub-criteria. The pilot
    survey data analysis demonstrated that the performance properties, site conditions
    and material logistics, and social impact criteria were consistently prioritized.
    The critical sub-criteria identified were fire resistance, watertightness, local
    availability, occupant health, and safety and protection. For the Monte Calo simulations,
    the predictions aligned with the pilot study, enhancing the robustness of the
    results. Keywords: classification; criteria; consensus; construction; materials;
    properties; severity index 1. Introduction Wooden buildings represent a significant
    percentage of single-family homes in North America (90%), Europe (70–45%), and
    Japan (45%) [1]. In addition, other countries, despite having lower percentages,
    boast substantial volumes of wooden construction. Approximately 20% of buildings
    in Chile are wooden, amounting to nearly 1.3 million homes—a significant market
    share [2]. In contrast, Brazil has around 6.7% of buildings made of wood, a smaller
    market share but representing over 3.8 million wooden houses due to its larger
    volume [3]. Prefabricated wood construction (wall and modules) is a method for
    fabricating building components in controlled factories and assembling them on-site
    [4]. However, there need to be more studies that provide a holistic overview and
    guidelines for material selection in prefabricated wood construction, despite
    the availability of research on material and building performance. Material selection
    during building design is crucial as it significantly impacts the project’s success,
    including durability, maintenance requirements, customer satisfaction, production
    systems, life cycle, use, operating environment, and costs [5,6]. To address this
    gap, multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) can be a valuable tool for selecting
    the most appropriate materials. MCDA is a comparative support tool that allows
    for assessing alternatives based on competing criteria [7]. It offers decision-makers
    a structured approach to selecting choices by considering various perspectives
    or measures. Survey analysis, which involves gathering and compiling insights
    from a selected group of professionals, can be used to analyze and classify these
    criteria [8,9,10,11,12,13]. In addition, surveys can enhance the understanding
    of specific themes or criteria and accelerate the decision-making process, leading
    to increased decisiveness [14]. Surveys have been used in various fields, such
    as medicine, infectious animal diseases, and education, to gather opinions and
    reach a professional consensus [15,16,17,18]. For example, [19] used surveys to
    obtain expert agreement in identifying critical success factors for transitioning
    toward sustainable universities, while [20] conducted surveys among professionals
    in the construction industry to develop a model for selecting facade materials
    with lower maintenance requirements. In addition, Monte Carlo Simulation, a statistical
    technique involving multiple simulations to predict scenarios by calculating probabilities,
    can be integrated into decision-making and classification processes to improve
    confidence in the results obtained, address the inconsistency, and mitigate small-sample
    bias [21,22,23]. In addition, Monte Carlo Simulation is a strategy commonly employed
    to assess theoretical situations and perform “what-if” examinations within systems
    or procedures where conducting experimental trials proves excessively expensive
    or unfeasible [24,25]. This technique uses random sampling and iterative approaches
    to create models based on different sets of randomly generated probability values,
    resulting in a stable output probability distribution. Monte Carlo simulations
    can help better forecast outcomes, minimize decision-making risks, and improve
    the accuracy and reliability of results [26,27]. Despite the potential of these
    methods, there need to be more studies in the scientific literature that summarize
    the criteria for choosing structural and envelope materials for prefabricated
    construction in North America, particularly in Canada and the United States. Therefore,
    this study’s main objective was to identify the indicators (criteria and sub-criteria)
    for selecting materials for prefabricated wooden construction and, subsequently,
    categorize these criteria and sub-criteria based on the perspective of industry
    professionals. 2. Methodology The methodology for this study involved three phases.
    First, a literature review was conducted to identify potential criteria for choosing
    structural and envelope materials in wooden prefabricated buildings. Second, a
    pilot survey was conducted in Canada and the United States to classify the priority
    order of the criteria obtained from the literature based on professionals’ opinions.
    Finally, Monte Carlo simulations were conducted using the data obtained from the
    previous phase to improve decision-making and classification processes. 2.1. The
    Identification of Selection of Criteria The identification of the selection criteria
    for building materials was carried out through a literature review. This search
    was carried out over the past twenty years (2000–2020), utilizing information
    from diverse specialized sources (e.g., scientific and technical journals, books,
    technical guides, and standards) published in English. To ensure a comprehensive
    search, a diverse range of keyword combinations was utilized across five searches
    using five databases (Compendex, Inspec, GEOBASE, GeoRef, and Knovel) via the
    Engineering Village platform. Search 1 used the following keywords: wood buildings,
    building materials, structures, envelopes, the United States, and Canada. Search
    2 explored the following keywords: wood buildings, materials, use, and choice.
    Search 3 delved into construction, composites application, selection, and wood.
    Search 4 concentrated on the following keywords: buildings, materials selection,
    envelopes, structures, and wood. Lastly, Search 5 centered on buildings, materials
    selection, wood, and materials. These searches comprehensively cover various aspects
    of selecting structural and envelope materials for wood buildings. After reviewing
    the titles and abstracts, 54 articles were chosen meticulously and thoroughly.
    Furthermore, these documents contributed additional references, enriching the
    literature review and augmenting the process of identifying criteria. 2.2. Pilot
    Survey The pilot survey was administered through an online questionnaire that
    utilized a 5-point Likert scale (very important = 5, important = 4, neutral =
    3, not very important = 2, and not important = 1). The questionnaire was structured
    and designed with Google Forms®. The pilot study consisted of three main parts.
    First, descriptive information was obtained about the respondents to understand
    their responses according to their profiles. Secondly, professionals gave priority
    orders. Lastly, the results were examined. The respondents were chosen based on
    their professional experience in prefabricated wood construction in Canada or
    the United States, following the subsequent conditions: (i) professionals actively
    engaged in materials decision-making, such as architects, engineers, and project
    managers, (ii) specialists in prefabricated wood construction, covering both 2D
    systems (such as prefab wood systems) and 3D buildings (volumetric), and (iii)
    experts with a minimum of five years professional experience in these specific
    domains [28]. They were identified by reviewing their professional profiles, such
    as LinkedIn, resumes, and professional websites, across different regions in both
    countries to ensure a comprehensive industry perspective. After analyzing the
    profiles, a pilot survey was sent to 42 professionals, and 25 responses were received,
    resulting in a response rate of 59%. This response rate exceeds the minimum requirement
    of 50% for survey confirmation, as recommended by Biresselioglu et al. [29]. The
    survey was administered using links individually distributed via email. The email
    contained a cover letter that explained the purpose of the study, provided information
    about the researcher, and assured participants of confidentiality and anonymity.
    Anonymity prevents bias, reduces the influence of dominant individuals, mitigates
    socio-psychological pressure, and alleviates the fear of expressing opinions publicly
    [30]. The pilot survey consisted of two parts. The first part collected basic
    background information from the respondents, such as their education level, role
    held, work areas, and years of experience, to understand their answers better.
    The second part collected responses to prioritize criteria from the literature
    review using a Likert scale. Furthermore, respondents were allowed to provide
    additional criteria and comments in the final section of the survey. Two separate
    reminder emails were sent in the two weeks following the initial email to increase
    participation rates. The pilot survey was conducted between 20 July and 31 August
    2021. The results were analyzed by grouping them in three different ways: Canada
    only, the United States only, and Canada and the United States together, to identify
    any differences in opinions. Two analyses were utilized to examine the results:
    consensus and severity index (SI), which complement each other. Consensus is strong
    when at least 75% of professionals rate a criterion as 4 or 5 on the Likert scale,
    moderate when 60% to 74% agree, and weak when less than 60% reach consensus. Lack
    of consensus (lower than 60%) indicates lower importance in the selection process.
    This rating is commonly used in studies to measure consensus and criterion acceptability
    and is adopted in this research [31,32,33]. Literature suggests using nonparametric
    procedures for data classification, as parametric statistics like mean and standard
    deviation may not yield meaningful results. Then, after verifying consensus, the
    SI was used to classify the criteria [34,35,36]. The following formula was used
    to determine the SI [35]: Severity index= ⎛ ⎝ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ∑ α i = ω i f
    i n α ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟   (1) where i = the point value given to each criterion
    by the respondent, ranging from 1 to 5; ωi = the weight of each point; fi = the
    frequency of point value i among all respondents; n = the total number of responses
    (n = 25 in this study); and α = the highest weight (α = 5 in this study). Furthermore,
    the notation indicated by [34] was used for the SI values calculated to categorize
    the criteria into five priority levels: High (H) (0.8 ≤ SI ≤ 1), High–Medium (H–M)
    (0.6 ≤ SI < 0.8), Medium (M) (0.4 ≤ SI < 0.6), Medium–Low (M–L) (0.2 ≤ SI < 0.4),
    and Low (L) (0 ≤ SI < 0.2). Monte Carlo Simulation According to Mundfrom et al.
    [37], Monte Carlo simulations for original studies typically start with 1000 interactions.
    However, for replicated studies and statistical calculations, it is generally
    suggested to use at least 10,000 interactions to improve the reliability and accuracy
    of the results. Furthermore, Heijungs et al. [38] recommend using 1000, 10,000,
    or 100,000 interactions depending on the situation, assuming perfect knowledge
    of input distributions for accurately estimating output distributions. Thus, in
    this study, probability distributions were computed through Monte Carlo simulations
    using varying numbers of interactions, including 1000, 10,000 and 100,000. The
    simulations were based on survey responses obtained, and the data was grouped
    in three ways: Canada only, the United States only, and Canada and the United
    States combined. This approach detected potential differences in opinions across
    the two countries. All simulations were conducted using the R programming language,
    with software R studio version 2023.03.0+386. 3. Results 3.1. Main Criteria and
    Sub-Criteria Identified for Choosing Building Materials The literature review
    identified seven main criteria: performance properties, green materials, energy
    efficiency, circular economy, site conditions and material logistics, standards,
    and social impact. These criteria and their respective sub-criteria are listed
    in Table 1 and are described in the following sections. Table 1. Criteria and
    sub-criteria for the choice of building materials. 3.1.1. Performance Properties
    The performance property sub-criteria are essential in selecting suitable building
    materials as they define the minimum values a material must meet to function effectively.
    Mechanical properties, such as strength, hardness, elasticity, plasticity, ductility,
    brittleness, and toughness, are often emphasized in previous studies when choosing
    building materials [39,48,60,123]. For instance, Innella et al. [60] conducted
    a study that evaluated the mechanical performance of prefabricated buildings during
    transport. The results revealed that plywood panels and their steel joints were
    sensitive to vibrations during transport, with shear stresses exceeding the material’s
    strength in 95.4% of the cases. Using lower-performance plywood in the building
    envelope may impact the building’s overall performance. Durability is another
    crucial property, as natural weathering factors such as UV light, moisture, temperature
    changes, fungi, and termites can reduce building materials’ mechanical and physical
    performance [124,125]. In envelope facades, plastics, particularly polymers, are
    commonly used as coverings, and studies have been conducted to enhance their durability
    [53,59,71]. For example, using commercial pigments, Butylina et al. [121] improved
    the durability of wood-polypropylene composites. Weathering tests for 3–12 months
    showed pigmented composites had less discoloration, lower water absorption, and
    higher Charpy impact strength. Fire resistance and fire safety are always a concern
    for wood buildings. As a result, increasing attention has been paid to innovative
    flame-retardant processing technologies [45,56,76,126]. Timber products and wood-based
    materials are typically treated with fire retardants through surface coatings
    and impregnation, among other methods, to enhance safety [57,66,127]. In addition,
    new structural technologies like mass timber components have been suggested as
    another route to improve fire resistance [43]. Thermal efficiency is also an important
    criterion, and the thermal performance of insulation materials and other building
    envelope and structural components has been investigated. Using materials with
    good thermal performance can reduce peak indoor temperatures and improve occupants’
    thermal comfort [44,54,68,74,77]. In addition, building design, such as the distance
    between layers of walls and the type of material and joints used for exterior
    cladding, can also affect a building’s thermal performance [68]. Watertightness
    (i.e., materials that water cannot enter or escape) and water permeability (i.e.,
    capacity to allow water through a material) are essential for building performance,
    as materials produced from bio-based sources are typically less resistant to water
    vapor permeation and more vulnerable to mold growth [42,49,52,55,67,72,75]. Maintaining
    relative humidity below 70% is recommended for wood construction to prevent mold
    and rot. Cross-laminated timber (CLT) panels have been found to help maintain
    recommended relative humidity levels in wood construction [41]. Acoustic comfort
    is essential for human well-being in buildings, and various materials, including
    bio-based and synthetic materials, have been developed to control noise [40,46,69].
    For example, Faustino et al. [51] used corn cob particle boards to reduce building
    noise. This material is comparable to traditional construction materials such
    as glass wool and expanded polystyrene in terms of its noise reduction properties.
    In addition, D’Alessandro et al. [50] reported that green walls can absorb up
    to 80% of incident acoustic energy for frequencies above 1000 Hz, providing another
    approach for enhancing acoustic comfort in buildings. 3.1.2. Green Materials The
    use of green materials in construction refers to materials made from renewable
    sources that have fewer adverse environmental effects. These materials typically
    have low toxicity, low levels of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), are made from
    recycled materials, and have a low environmental impact. High levels of VOCs in
    building materials can pose health risks to occupants and construction workers,
    making using low VOC materials crucial in sustainable construction. This practice
    is also recognized and rewarded with additional points when applying for environmental
    certifications [80,81,86,89,91,128,129,130]. Green materials are generally made
    from natural or recycled materials, requiring minimal energy and non-renewable
    resources, resulting in reduced environmental impact compared to conventional
    materials [79]. These materials have gained renewed interest in the past fifteen
    years, particularly in Europe and North America, as they effectively reduce the
    depletion of non-renewable resources and minimize the environmental impact of
    disposal processes at the end of a product’s life [87,131]. The production and
    use of recycled materials in construction are becoming increasingly popular as
    they prevent environmental pollution by managing bio-based waste from forestry
    and agriculture. They also avoid the environmental impacts of waste-to-energy
    conversion or landfill disposal [83]. The strategy of utilizing products from
    planted forests is also noteworthy. Despite their small proportion of global forests,
    these cultivated woodlands contribute significantly, supplying 35–40% of the global
    roundwood harvest [132,133]. Forecasts predict their potential expansion to reach
    80% of the worldwide wood harvest by 2030. This growth promises larger, sustainable
    harvests, potentially reshaping the timber industry [134,135]. Moreover, recent
    studies suggest that using local and recycled building materials can reduce CO2
    emissions, promote the construction of more eco-efficient buildings, and strengthen
    the local economy [88,90]. 3.1.3. Energy Efficiency The criteria for energy efficiency
    in buildings often consider materials with low embodied energy and those that
    have received low-energy certifications [92,93,94]. Embodied energy is used during
    the production, assembly, demolition, and disposal of building materials [95].
    Therefore, choosing materials with low energy demand can result in energy savings
    in building operations [96,97,98]. One approach to achieving this is by using
    materials that have energy labels and certifications, such as Energy Star® (issued
    by the US Environmental Protection Agency), EnerGuide (issued by Natural Resources
    Canada), and Building EQ (published by ASHRAE), among others, which provide information
    to building operators and comply with quality management systems [99,100,101].
    Furthermore, adopting energy certifications significantly affects energy policies
    that reduce building energy consumption. Energy certifications have been successfully
    implemented in developed countries, demonstrating their effectiveness as a tool
    for governments to promote energy-efficient buildings. To better understand the
    economic value of energy efficiency labels, [102] developed a pricing model for
    Metro Atlanta (US) and reported that buildings with energy certification are sold
    at an 11.7% premium in terms of price. The New Buildings Institute (NBI) conducted
    a study in 2008 and concluded that Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design
    (LEED) certification results in energy savings of 25 to 30% [136]. Another study
    by Newsham et al. [103] analyzed data from the NBI and similarly found that LEED-certified
    buildings consume 18 to 39% less energy compared to comparable non-certified buildings.
    3.1.4. Circular Economy The criteria referred to as the circular economy relates
    to the economical use of resources and materials, such as the cumulative cost
    during its useful life and the cost for disassembly or reuse. Considering its
    life cycle, it must also achieve its performance over time [104,105]. Buildings
    are generally designed to be permanent structures, expected to last 50–75 years.
    However, due to changing user needs, their lifespan often becomes shorter, around
    20 years. When materials hinder replacements or disassembly, it results in higher
    energy and production consumption, increased waste production, and restricted
    adaptability [108]. Zhou et al. [107] emphasized that circular economy should
    be a primary consideration in material selection, encompassing procurement, processing,
    transportation, recycling, and disposal costs. In addition, research has been
    conducted on implementing prefabricated strategies to enhance the assembly and
    disassembly of structures based on lifecycle demands [109]. Thus, buildings should
    be designed as material banks for future construction to enable the reuse of building
    materials and facilitate the deconstruction of their components and parts. This
    approach promotes a closed-loop system, ensuring that members and materials can
    be effectively repurposed, thereby contributing to sustainable resource utilization
    in the construction industry [110,111]. Understanding the potential applications
    of a material is crucial in selecting the most suitable material for a specific
    purpose, as highlighted in previous studies [106]. 3.1.5. Site Conditions and
    Material Logistics The criteria for site conditions and logistics regarding the
    characteristics of the area and its surroundings, include the climate, material
    delivery logistics, and the type of buildings based on the chosen building materials.
    These criteria play a crucial role in determining the materials to be used in
    construction, considering factors such as ease of material use, location, shape,
    and height of the building, as well as material availability [20,49,112]. A study
    by Ogunkah et al. [88] surveyed professionals from various disciplines and geographic
    contexts to assess the likelihood of impacts from other factors that may influence
    strategic decision-making in material selection. The results revealed that 64%
    of the sample population considered general or site-specific variables. Moreover,
    the choice of materials for a specific location is influenced by material availability,
    climate, economy, and construction technique. However, the availability of materials
    should be considered at the construction stage and when replacements are required
    [112]. 3.1.6. Documentation and Standardization The documentation and standardization
    criteria are based on materials that have established codes. Documents play a
    crucial role in improving material selection and avoiding materials with inadequate
    performance. Adhering to materials that align with papers and standards helps
    professionals analyze the impact of materials on building costs and prevents the
    selection of materials with subpar performance [137,138]. The sub-criteria in
    this criterion encompass the availability of material selection guidelines, updated
    material information, and other relevant documentation. Standards for evaluating
    and classifying materials are of particular interest [20,129,139,140]. This information
    also aids professionals in analyzing the materials that can affect maintenance
    costs during the early design phase and helps avoid using faulty materials. These
    records provide factual information about the materials used in building construction,
    thereby ensuring accuracy and reliability. 3.1.7. Social Impact The social impact
    criteria refer to the benefit that society derives from using certain materials
    in buildings and includes criteria such as aesthetics, health, and comfort of
    building occupants, among others [20,114,115]. Social impact means a healthy and
    safe environment for all stakeholders in the building industry, such as construction
    workers, building users, and operators. It must be considered during the sustainable
    design process [116,117]. However, social impact is much more complex than the
    other quantification criteria and has not received much attention in the architectural
    literature. Social and sensory factors or variables account for 24% of a material
    use survey conducted by Ogunkah et al. [88]. The aesthetic of the building is
    an additional value to be considered to preserve the architectural style of the
    built environment in the area or promote the image of a company. A company often
    encourages the construction of its buildings with a corporate image that identifies
    it and gives it more prestige and, in doing so, emphasizes the aesthetic requirement
    as a sustainable aspect [118]. In addition, according to a study by [88], 96%
    of respondents identified environmental and health factors or variables as the
    most desirable content information to enable efficient and sustainable decisions
    when choosing appropriate materials. More sustainable buildings benefit the environment
    and occupants. They can produce substantial economic benefits by reducing operating
    expenses and, in contrast, improving the market value of buildings, occupant productivity,
    and the ability to generate income from businesses renting space, and optimizing
    the economic performance throughout the construction life cycle [119,120,121].
    3.2. Pilot Survey Responses This section presents the results of the pilot survey’s
    two parts. In the first part, the main objective was to identify the sample’s
    characteristics, including basic information about respondents’ backgrounds such
    as education, role held, region of work, work areas and experience, and knowledge
    about the topic. The second part aimed to understand the respondents’ prioritization
    of the various criteria, verify the consensus, and classify the criteria based
    on their severity index. 3.2.1. Sample Characteristics The pilot survey results
    were grouped in three different ways for analysis (Canada only, the United States
    only, and Canada and the United States together) to ascertain differences in opinion.
    Thirteen of the twenty-five respondents were from Canada, and twelve were from
    the United States. Figure 1 shows that 77% (10/13) of the Canadian respondents
    have a bachelor’s degree, 15% (2/13) have a technical education, and 8% (1/13)
    have a Ph.D. (see the light gray bar). As for the United States, 75% (9/12) hold
    a bachelor’s degree, while 25% (3/12) have a master’s degree (see the dark gray
    bar). The results for both Canada and the United States together show that 76%
    (19/25) of respondents have a bachelor’s degree, 12% (3/25) have a master’s degree,
    8% (2/25) have a technical education, and 4% (1/25) have a Ph.D. (see the black
    bar). Figure 1. Education level of pilot survey respondents from Canada, the United
    States, and Canada and the United States together. Figure 2 presents pilot survey
    respondent information, including years of experience (a), the size of the company
    they work for (b), their role in the company or the decision-making process (c),
    the types of construction projects in which the company is involved (d), and the
    company’s expertise (e). Pilot survey respondents were experienced prefabricated
    construction professionals from different organizations/institutions in Canada
    and the United States, including architectural and engineering firms, consulting
    firms, general contractors, and construction management firms. This study categorized
    coordinators, presidents, and project managers as “managers” due to their similar
    job characteristics. Figure 2. Respondents’ backgrounds: (a) years of experience;
    (b) company size; (c) role in the company/decision-making process; (d) company’s
    types of projects; and (e) company’s expertise. The results show that in Canada,
    about 77% (10/13) of the professionals had more than ten years of experience,
    and 23% (3/13) had between 5 and 10 years of experience (light gray bar). In the
    United States, 100% (12/12) of the professionals had more than ten years of experience
    (dark gray bar). When both countries are analyzed together (black bar), the professionals
    with more than ten years of experience represent 88% (22/25) of respondents (Figure
    2a). Figure 2b shows the size of the company respondents work for. More than 50%
    (7/13) of Canadian respondents and 67% (8/12) of US respondents were from companies
    with fewer than 99 employees. As for respondents’ roles in the company or the
    decision-making process, Figure 2c shows that in Canada, about 54% (7/13) of respondents
    were managers, and 38% (5/13) were architects. In contrast, in the United States,
    58% (7/12) were managers, 33% (4/12) were architects, and 8% (1/12) were engineers.
    When both Canada and the United States are analyzed together, 56% (14/25) of the
    sample is composed of managers, followed by 36% (9/25) of architects and 8% (2/25)
    of engineers who are the primary individuals responsible for choosing the products
    to be used in a construction project. As shown in Figure 2d, about 54% (7/13)
    of Canadian respondents were involved in residential projects, followed by 38%
    (5/13) in multi-unit projects and 8% (1/13) in public projects (see the light
    gray bar). In the United States, 42% (5/12) of respondents were involved in residential
    projects and 58% (7/12) in multi-unit projects. When analyzing Canada and the
    United States together, 48% (12/25) of respondents were involved in residential
    projects, 48% (12/25) in multi-unit projects, and 4% (1/25) in public projects.
    Regarding the company’s expertise (Figure 2e), the results show that most of the
    Canadian respondents, i.e., 31% (4/13), were involved in companies that work with
    prefabricated modules, followed by 15% (2/13) that work with prefabricated walls.
    Furthermore, about 23% (3/13) of the Canadian respondents were involved in companies
    that work on both prefabricated walls and modules, 23% (3/13) are prefabricated
    wood construction consultants, and 8% (1/13) are specialized in mass timber products.
    Most of the US respondents were involved in companies that work with prefabricated
    modules, i.e., 42% (5/12), and prefabricated walls, i.e., 42% (5/12) (see the
    dark gray bar). When both Canada and the United States are analyzed together,
    prefabricated modules and walls, as well as both combined (wall and modules),
    represent the majority of the employer companies’ expertise, i.e., 36% (9/25),
    28% (7/25) and 20% (5/25), respectively. Therefore, since respondents’ experience
    in prefabricated wooden buildings and their strategic positioning in the building
    material decision-making process is quite respectable, their opinions and points
    of view obtained through the pilot survey can be considered meaningful and reliable.
    3.2.2. Criteria and Sub-Criteria Classification Table 2 presents the SI analysis
    classification results for Canada, the United States, and Canada and the United
    States. They show each sub-criterion’s consensus, severity index (SI), priority
    level, and final priority, as proposed by [34]. The results of the analysis of
    Canadian respondents showed that fourteen sub-criteria obtained strong consensus
    since they were rated 4 or 5 on the Likert scale by at least 75% of the professionals,
    four sub-criteria received moderate consensus, i.e., 60% to 74% of respondents
    rated them 4 or 5. Seven sub-criteria obtained weak agreement since less than
    60% of participants rated them 4 or 5. Thus, the professionals accepted only eighteen
    of the twenty-five sub-criteria selected from the literature. Subsequently, the
    SI-based classification results for Canada are also listed in Table 2. From these
    results, it can be seen that fourteen sub-criteria were classified as H (i.e.,
    of high priority) in structural and envelope material decision-making for wooden
    buildings, with SI values between 0.9692 and 0.8153. Among those fourteen sub-criteria,
    the ones classified first and second highest are related to performance properties:
    watertightness was ranked first in priority, with an SI of 0.9692, followed by
    fire performance, with an SI of 0.9538. Table 2. Classification of building material
    selection criteria for Canada, the United States, and Canada and the United States.
    On the other hand, the sub-criteria that classified third and fourth in terms
    of priority were the health of occupants and comfort and well-being, which fall
    under social impact criteria. The top ten classified criteria were watertightness,
    fire resistance, the health of occupants, comfort and well-being, local availability,
    ease of use/application, durability, proper standards, mechanical performance
    and location, shape, and height of the building. It was noted that five of those
    ten criteria pertain to the criteria performance properties and social impact.
    On the other hand, the results showed that the sub-criteria related to green materials,
    energy efficiency, and circular economy were among the least important at the
    time of selection. The pilot survey results for the United States show that twelve
    criteria obtained strong consensus, five obtained moderate consensus, and eight
    obtained weak consensus. Therefore, the professionals accepted seventeen of the
    twenty-five criteria selected from the literature. On the other hand, the SI-based
    classification showed that only ten criteria were considered of high priority
    (H) in structural and envelope material decision-making for wooden buildings,
    with SI values between 0.9500 and 0.8166. Three of those ten criteria are in the
    site conditions and material logistics criteria, the first being location, shape,
    and height of the building with the highest severity index value (SI = 0.9500),
    followed by ease of material use and/or application, which was classified as fourth
    (SI = 0.9167), and availability of material which ranked seventh (SI = 0.8534).
    Moreover, the results showed that the social impact is of great importance when
    choosing materials in the United States, being two of its four criteria classified
    in the top five overall—comfort and well-being of building occupants ranked third
    and health of building occupants was classified as fifth. Moreover, as was the
    case for respondents in Canada, respondents in the United States also considered
    the watertightness (second) and durability (sixth) sub-criteria essential for
    prefabricated wooden construction. In addition, using materials that are easy
    to apply (ease of material use and/or application criteria) was among the highest
    classified (fourth), with a severity index of 0.9167. In the Canadian classification
    for the top ten sub-criteria, there was dispersion observed for the criteria of
    site performance properties (4/8 in the top ten), conditions and logistics (3/3
    in the top ten), documentation (1/2 in the top ten), and social impact (2/4 in
    the top ten) when selecting structural or envelope materials for prefabricated
    wooden construction. In contrast, in the United States, the top ten sub-criteria
    were primarily focused on social impact (4/4 in the top ten) and site conditions
    and logistics (3/3 in the top ten), as seen in Table 2. Upon seeing this difference
    in response patterns, we analyzed respondents from both countries and their responses
    as a single sample group (see Table 2), as was mentioned earlier. It is essential
    to highlight that these findings do not claim to be statistically representative.
    They provide insight into the relative importance of the proposed criteria according
    to the respondents’ experience and their national context. The analysis results
    of Canada’s and the United States’ respondents show that thirteen criteria obtained
    strong consensus (i.e., were rated 4 or 5 by at least 75% of the professionals).
    At the same time, only two achieved moderate consensus, i.e., were rated 4 or
    5 by 60% to 74% of respondents, and ten had weak agreement since less than 60%
    of participants rated them 4 or 5. When both countries were analyzed together,
    only twelve sub-criteria reached the minimum threshold to be considered relevant
    and classified as H priority by the professionals’ opinions, with SI values between
    0.9200 and 0.8160. Watertightness was ranked as the most critical sub-criteria
    to consider when choosing materials. The improved water-tightness of materials
    is believed to enhance the durability of buildings, as excessive moisture content,
    particularly fluctuations in the moisture levels of wood materials, can result
    in repetitive shrinkage and swelling mechanisms. These mechanisms can weaken the
    material’s mechanical strength over time [141,142]. The second most important
    was the sub-criterion ease of material use and/or application, with an SI value
    of 0.9167. Furthermore, when both countries are considered together, four of the
    top ten criteria are in social impact, the health of occupants (third), comfort
    and well-being (eighth), safety and security (ninth), and aesthetics (tenth).
    3.3. Monte Carlo Simulations Table 3 presents the SI values and the final priorities
    calculated based on the Monte Carlo simulations (1000, 10,000, and 100,000) for
    Canada, the United States, and Canada and the United States, respectively. The
    prediction of the SI for different simulations in Canada and the United States
    yielded consistent results. In Canada, the top five crucial sub-criteria remained
    the same across the simulations: fire resistance, watertightness, local availability,
    the health of occupants, and safety and security. Only the places varied. These
    predictions align with the results obtained from the pilot survey, further validating
    their accuracy. It is worth noting that the top two sub-criteria consistently
    maintained their coherence throughout all simulations. Table 3. Monte Carlo simulations
    to predict the classification of building material selection criteria. Similarly,
    for the United States, the prioritization of the top five sub-criteria for material
    selection was observed across the simulations. The most critical sub-criteria
    were location, shape and height, comfort and well-being, ease to use/apply, health
    of occupants, and durability. These predictions agree with the pilot survey results,
    where the top two sub-criteria remained consistent across all simulations. Furthermore,
    the sub-criterion location, shape, and height was identified as the most important,
    followed by comfort and well-being. For the simulations regarding Canada and the
    United States, the predictions showed that the five most relevant sub-criteria
    for selection were in line with the trends assessed in the surveys. Furthermore,
    the predictions demonstrated that the sub-criteria of ease to use/apply, occupants’
    health, and location, shape, and height were among the most critical factors in
    choosing products for envelopes and structures. In general, the three separate
    analyses conducted for Canada, the United States, and Canada and the United States
    combined produced consistent predictions that aligned with the respective pilot
    survey results. Through these findings, it is possible to have a sub-criteria
    indicators for selecting, or an indicator for future product development in each
    region in the combined analysis. 4. Discussion and Limitations The sub-criteria
    such as watertightness and durability are closely related in the decision-making
    process of wooden buildings since using a building component that could be more
    watertight will consequently lead to decreased durability. The exact parallel
    can be found when crossing the properties of the products used in wood building
    structures and envelopes with the safety and security of building occupants, i.e.,
    the use of products with poor mechanical, physical, and durability performance
    might negatively impact occupants’ experience and health [143]. As stated in ASHRAE
    Standard 160 [144], the building envelope and structures are generally not utterly
    watertight independent of the water management system applied. A small amount
    of rainwater might, therefore, penetrate behind the cladding. Thus, as reported
    by the respondents, the use of materials that make it possible to eliminate the
    possibility of water infiltration or reduce it to a minimum in wooden construction
    is of great importance in decision-making. Moreover, in the case of severe weather
    conditions, which are common in Canada and the United States, a lack of watertightness
    increases the risk of water ingress, which can lead to premature deterioration
    of the structural system and the envelope itself and is generally perceived as
    discomfort as some studies point out [145,146]. Regarding occupant health, indoor
    air quality is critical to occupant well-being. McArthur and Powell [147] and
    Wolkoff [148] indicate the effects of poor indoor air quality on occupants, including
    eye irritation, olfactory issues, and overall health. Therefore, selecting materials
    that promote good indoor air quality is essential to provide occupant comfort
    and well-being. High importance was accorded to fire performance sub-criteria,
    and this result can be explained because of evacuation-related risks during fire
    situations [149]. A building fire can result in human casualties and facilitate
    the spread of fire through damaged walls or to neighboring compartments or buildings
    [150]. The high importance of the comfort and well-being sub-criterion in material
    selection can be attributed to its direct impact on human perception of immediate
    and long-term quality and its influence on psychological restoration. For example,
    Elsadek et al. [151] discuss how materials (green facades) might promote comfort
    and well-being and contribute to recovering physical and mental resources, enabling
    individuals to cope with and manage daily living situations effectively. This
    suggests that materials can positively impact individuals’ ability to manage and
    adapt to their environment. Chi et al. [152] emphasize the significance of visual
    comfort, highlighting how daylight availability creates a visually pleasing environment
    that positively impacts human well-being. Then, incorporating materials that can
    maximize natural light and create a visually appealing space might be a route
    to contribute to the occupant’s comfort and satisfaction. In addition to visual
    and thermal comfort, acoustic comfort plays a crucial role. Herranz-Pascual et
    al. [153] emphasize the impact of materials on acoustic conditions within a space,
    highlighting the importance of sound insulation and noise reduction for creating
    a comfortable environment. Gou et al. [154] focus on thermal comfort, pointing
    out that good thermal properties can significantly enhance occupants’ comfort
    levels. Harkouss et al. [155] examine the perception of overheating and highlight
    the importance of providing an environment that helps regulate indoor temperature
    effectively. On the other hand, the results show that sub-criteria related to
    sustainable development, such as those in the energy efficiency and green material
    criteria and the product with EPD and cost of dismantling and removal sub-criteria,
    are less critical in the decision-making process. However, some respondents claimed
    that such criteria might have a higher classification depending on the type of
    project, especially when it comes to projects aiming for LEED or other sustainability
    certifications. Furthermore, some respondents argued that it is important to choose
    local products, which can minimize logistics costs and strengthen the local economy.
    Moreover, as pointed out in reference [113], the use of local material is a criterion
    that is often considered to be synonymous with job creation due to growing awareness
    of its ramifications. A study conducted by Si et al. [156] evaluated 39 criteria
    for buildings in the United Kingdom and China, and the engineers and architects
    consulted in both countries classified durability as the most crucial criterion
    for non-domestic buildings. In addition, it was found when analyzing both countries
    together that respondents gave less priority to the criteria related to sustainable
    development, e.g., those in the energy efficacy and green material criteria and
    the product with EPD and cost of dismantling and removal criteria. It is seen
    that the sub-criteria for site conditions and logistics criteria were among the
    top-ranked. These criteria were crucial during the building’s implementation phase,
    significantly impacted construction operations, and directly affected project
    quality. It is also critical for cost estimations, often accounting for up to
    70% of total construction costs [157]. Furthermore, the criterion use of local
    materials was indicated in the final tab of the pilot survey by six professionals
    from Canada and three from the United States as an essential factor in the decision-making.
    Selecting local materials as much as possible—not only for sustainability but
    also for local economic benefit. Regarding the criterion of ease of use of materials,
    one of the respondents said that the leading time to acquire the components, the
    erection time, and the complexity demanded by certain materials must be considered.
    Moreover, it is argued that the skill level required from the labor and the machinery
    required to transport or erect need to be pondered in the decision. This study
    offers valuable insights into material selection for prefabricated wood buildings.
    However, as pointed out in [28], limitations exist regarding the findings’ applicability
    beyond Canada and the United States due to differing climates, regulations, and
    cultural preferences. Additionally, ongoing changes in technology, regulations,
    and user preferences could affect the relevance of identified criteria over time.
    Implementing decisions based on these findings may also be influenced by budget
    constraints, material availability, and specific project needs, impacting their
    direct applicability. 5. Conclusions In conclusion, this study has identified
    and classified the priority orders of sub-criteria crucial for material selection
    in prefabricated wood constructions. The insights drawn from the opinions of professionals
    from Canada, the United States, and both countries have provided comprehensive
    perspectives on the sub-criteria influencing decision-making in this domain. From
    the literature review, seven main criteria were found i.e., performance properties,
    green materials, energy efficiency, material economy, site conditions and material
    logistics, standards, and social impact. From the pilot survey, sub-criteria under
    performance properties, site conditions, material logistics, and social impact
    emerged as focal indicators across the analysis, consistently ranking among the
    top priorities. Through Monte Carlo simulations, the study revealed a remarkable
    consistency in the top-ranked sub-criteria for Canada and the United States, underscoring
    indicators such as fire resistance, watertightness, local availability, occupant
    health, safety, and protection. Furthermore, the simulations reinforced the significance
    of location, shape, height, comfort, well-being, ease of use/application, and
    durability in material selection processes, aligning with pilot study outcomes
    and demonstrating robustness within varying analyses. This study offers valuable
    insights into material selection for prefabricated wood buildings. Also, it provides
    interesting practical implications for future research as it furnishes helpful
    indicators and guidelines to aid decision-making tools and models, specifically
    benefiting the selection of materials for prefabricated wood constructions in
    Canada and the United States. These insights also serve as a foundational resource
    for future product development in the construction of buildings, particularly
    those utilizing prefabricated wood materials. However, limitations exist regarding
    the findings’ applicability beyond Canada and the United States due to differing
    climates, regulations, and cultural preferences. Additionally, ongoing changes
    in technology, regulations, and user preferences could affect the relevance of
    identified criteria over time. Implementing decisions based on these findings
    may also be influenced by budget constraints, material availability, and specific
    project needs, impacting their direct applicability. Author Contributions Methodology,

  description: Despite the wealth of research on smart cities, there is a lack of
    studies examining interlinkages between smart cities and Sustainable Development
    Goals (SDGs). In other words, there is limited research on how implementing smart
    city solutions can lead to co-benefits and/or trade-offs for achieving SDGs. This
    systematic literature review was conducted to fill this gap. Results show that
    responsible development/implementation of smart city solutions and technologies
    could contribute to the progress toward SDGs. The literature is mainly focused
    on SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption
    and Production), SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), and SDG 6 (Clean Water and
    Sanitation). More work on other SDGs is needed. There is a bias toward reporting
    the benefits of smart cities. These include accelerating economic growth, improving
    efficiency, strengthening innovation, and raising citizen awareness. These benefits
    indicate that smart cities could catalyze the transition to sustainable development
    and address climate change challenges. However, this requires addressing trade-offs
    related to issues such as privacy and cyber security, costs of infrastructure
    upgrading, rebound effects associated with efficiency improvements, biased decision-making,
    reproduction of social biases, digital divide and lack of skills, misuse of AI,
    and limited legal setup. This review elaborates on these trade-offs and offers
    solutions to minimize them. Results show that the COVID-19 pandemic has increased
    attention to the interactions between smart cities and the SDGs, particularly
    those related to health and climate action. However, it has also cemented many
    new unethical practices. This review highlights governance/policy challenges that
    should be addressed to ensure smart cities can better contribute to the SDGs.
    It concludes that multi-scale and transparent governance mechanisms and regulatory
    frameworks are crucial for ensuring that smart city solutions support the transition
    toward sustainable and resilient cities.

  explanation: The paper presents a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies
    that examine interlinkages between smart cities and the specific point in the
    review intention (in this case, providing user-friendly interfaces for farmers
    to input preferences, constraints, and expert knowledge into the automated irrigation
    system) with respect to the broader outline point and SDG list (in this case,
    SDG 7 targets, particularly 7.3 which is about increasing the share of renewable
    energy in the global energy mix). The review finds that the majority of the studies
    focus on urban management, ICT, transportation, and energy, with relatively less
    attention paid to other sectors and SDGs. The authors conclude that there is a
    need for more research on the interlinkages between smart cities and SDGs, particularly
    in the context of the specific point in the review intention.

    Nations launched Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 2015 to address the increasing
    global socio-economic and environmental challenges and ensure better and more
    sustainable pathways for future generations (Habitat, 2021). Global attention
    has been drawn to urban areas and cities for the successful achievement of the
    SDGs. In fact, long before the launch of SDGs, there have been efforts to promote
    urban sustainability since the late 1980''s when the Brundtland report was published
    (Brundtland, 1987). Aligned with the report''s agenda, urban sustainability efforts
    aim to prioritize the needs of both present and future generations by promoting
    urbanization patterns and implementing plans and policies that do not compromise
    the needs of future generations. The background to this is that the world is rapidly
    urbanizing, with over 55 % of the world''s population currently hosted in cities.
    By 2050, this share is projected to increase to approximately 68 % to 70 % (Kaneda,
    Greenbaum, & Kline, 2020). As such, cities have become very critical in addressing
    the socio-economic and environmental challenges facing the world today. The increasing
    global emphasis on urban transformation as a crucial element in achieving the
    SDGs has sparked extensive research. This literature demonstrates that cities
    are pivotal in driving the desired global changes. As noted in a report by the
    OECD (2022), most cities across the world have various policies and frameworks
    aimed at guiding operations and activities in underlying sectors such as water,
    housing, land use, climate change, transport, economy, and others that are pertinent
    to the SDGs. Further, it is argued that cities are more nimble and innovative
    than central governments, making them more likely to take transformative actions
    toward sustainability (Masuda, Kawakubo, Okitasari, & Morita, 2022). According
    to Leavesley, Trundle, and Oke (2022), the potential for local governments within
    a city to learn, share information, and transfer knowledge with their peers on
    ways to formulate customized policies targeting local challenges renders them
    the best candidates for achieving the SDGs. Cities can also develop strategies
    and mechanisms to finance various projects, particularly since these projects
    may not require as much capital as central government initiatives (Masuda et al.,
    2022). However, it is notable that the implementation of SDGs at the city scale
    is challenging as they are designed to be adopted at the national level. Several
    studies have highlighted the limitations of existing indicators and targets for
    operationalizing the SDGs (including SDG 11) in cities. Such studies have made
    efforts to align SDGs to the urban context and offer frameworks for measuring
    progress toward SDGs (particularly SDG 11) in cities (Berisha, Caprioli, & Cotella,
    2022; Koch & Krellenberg, 2018). Therefore, at the city level, there is a need
    for extensive research, especially on the best planning models that could be adopted
    to facilitate the achievement of the goals and ensure alignment with earlier agendas
    like the Brundtland report (Brundtland, 1987). One such model that is gaining
    substantial attention is the Smart City, which is anchored on the application
    of diverse smart technologies in the planning, management, monitoring, and operation
    of city activities. It has evolved from earlier models such as digital city, ubiquitous
    city, and knowledge city, and has a wider scope compared to them. In fact, while
    smart city projects and developments were initially technology-centered, the role
    of non-technological aspects (i.e., people, institutions, social innovation, knowledge
    economy, etc.) is increasingly recognized. Accordingly, smart cities are expected
    to facilitate the integration of technological, social, economic, and institutional
    dimensions to enhance quality of life, address local and global challenges, and
    promote the transition to sustainable development (Sharifi, 2019). Sustainability
    and smartness are believed to be highly linked. For instance, a comprehensive
    analysis of city labels shows that “sustainable city” and “smart city” are the
    most frequently co-occurring ones (Schraven, Joss, & de Jong, 2021). Smart cities
    may sometimes fail to contribute to the sustainability agenda, as an analysis
    of links between smart city policies and CO2 emissions indicates (Yigitcanlar
    & Kamruzzaman, 2018). However, other studies, such as Schraven et al. (2021),
    show that smart cities can contribute to achieving SDGs. Irrespective of the nature
    of the relationship between smart cities and SDGs, Yigitcanlar et al. (2019) emphasize
    that overlooking the link between sustainability and smartness in the urban development
    process can give rise to risks such as prioritization of short-term gains, marginalization,
    elitism, utilitarianism, commercial considerations prevailing over environmental
    concerns, and ultimately materialism. Therefore, it is unsurprising that the potential
    of the smart city concept and its contributions to SDGs has gained increasing
    recognition in the past few years (Deloitte, 2020). Some efforts have been made
    to investigate links between smart cities and SDGs. Visvizi and del Hoyo, 2021a,
    Visvizi and del Hoyo, 2021b believe the Smart City concept''s technological aspects
    can enable players to secure real-time data and feedback on different SDG indicators.
    This allows them to concentrate on the targeted implementation of different programs.
    Further, the Smart City approach allows for enhanced governance via tech-enabled
    tools, which is a relevant component, especially in providing a voice to urban
    dwellers who are important constituents in attaining the SDGs. The Smart City
    concept is also premised on optimal resource consumption, where novel approaches
    such as alternative mobility are promoted to replace fossil fuel-dependent urban
    activities. Further, with sensors and smart devices, smart cities can champion
    the prudent consumption of water and energy (through smart metering) (Talari et
    al., 2017). Despite the above-mentioned efforts, research on links between smart
    cities and SDGs is fragmented and mainly focused on the contributions of smart
    cities to achieving SDGs. In particular, there has been a special focus on contributions
    to SDGs 3, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, and 13 (United Nations, 2021). A key gap is regarding
    smart cities'' negative impacts in pursuing SDGs. For instance, it is not examined
    how the financial burden of implementing the smart city concept would compromise
    the achievement of SDGs 1, 2, 5, 12, and others. Investigating such trade-offs
    is essential as cities have often fallen short in promoting inclusivity, and the
    COVID-19 pandemic has further exacerbated this issue (UN-Habitat, 2022). Smart
    city solutions and technologies have also led to trade-offs related to the security
    and privacy of urban dwellers (Ismagilova, Hughes, Rana, & Dwivedi, 2020; van
    Zoonen, 2016). Further, there have been trade-offs regarding SDG12, with underwhelming
    performance regarding responsible consumption and production seen to increase.
    Existing literature is deficient in critically analyzing the underlying theoretical
    principles that connect these two concepts. Specifically, the prevailing technocratic
    ideology, which assumes that the advancement of smart city technologies will necessarily
    result in sustainability, has not been rigorously interrogated. Also, as mentioned
    earlier, articles focused on measuring progress toward SDGs, including SDG 11,
    have not adequately focused on the interlinkages between smart cities and SDGs
    (Berisha et al., 2022; Koch & Krellenberg, 2018). This study embarks on a more
    discerning examination of the connection between smart cities and SDGs, utilizing
    critical urban theory perspectives that challenge the techno-centric paradigms
    of urban futures. It contends that there must be a more deliberate focus on issues
    such as power dynamics, political considerations, and social justice within smart
    city initiatives to ensure that they align with the broader social objectives
    encapsulated in the SDGs, rather than disproportionately favoring technocratic
    elites (Alizadeh and Sharifi, 2023a, Alizadeh and Sharifi, 2023b). Through this
    examination, this review aims to outline theoretical tensions, potential conflicts,
    and paradoxes within the smart city-SDG relationship that have hitherto been insufficiently
    explored. Additionally, the review contributes to the theoretical discourse on
    how smart urbanism may be effectively leveraged for sustainable development (Brundtland,
    1987). Some efforts have focused on SDGs and the design of smart solutions for
    urban and regional development. Such efforts have attempted to establish objectives,
    themes, and a framework to connect these concepts (Fredericks et al., 2020; Fredericks
    et al., 2022). However, there is still a lack of review studies that comprehensively
    explore interlinkages between smart cities and SDGs. Blasi, Ganzaroli, and De
    Noni (2022) conducted a literature review to examine the convergence between research
    on smart cities and SDGs. Through word analysis, they found that these two fields
    are not yet well-converged. There has been more attention to technological and
    efficiency-related issues, but environmental and social issues are not well addressed
    (Blasi et al., 2022). They also highlighted the dominance of SDG11 and limited
    attention to other SDGs. Overall, this study argues that the contributions of
    smart cities to SDGs are not yet clear. Despite their contributions, Blasi et
    al. (2022) do not look into the co-benefits and trade-offs related to each SDG.
    Further, their work is just based on word analysis of keywords and titles of only
    21 articles. Finally, limited efforts focusing on the connection between smart
    technologies and environmental sustainability have suffered from technologically-deterministic
    approaches. Burgess (2023) criticizes such approaches and calls for a more nuanced
    understanding of everyday data cultures. This systematic literature review was
    conducted to fill this gap and further elaborate on the interlinkages between
    smart city solutions and technologies and the SDGs. Here, interlinkages mean co-benefits
    and trade-offs. The concept of co-benefits refers to the additional positive outcomes
    related to sustainable development goals that can result from implementing smart
    city initiatives and policies. In contrast, trade-offs arise when implementing
    smart city measures negatively impacts the attainment of SDGs. In other words,
    certain solutions devised to make cities smarter may have unintended consequences
    for the ongoing endeavors to achieve SDGs. This review is guided by two questions:
    1- How can smart city solutions and technologies contribute to the achievement
    of SDGs? 2- What are the potential negative impacts of smart solutions and technologies
    on SDGs that need to be addressed? In addition, the review also discusses key
    challenges that need to be addressed and policy and regulatory frameworks that
    should be developed to ensure smart cities can contribute to the achievement of
    SDGs. 2. Materials and methods A systematic literature review was conducted for
    the purpose of this study. The review is guided by the Preferred Reporting Items
    for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) approach for literature search
    and selection (Moher, Liberati, Tetzlaff, Altman, & The, 2009). The flowchart
    showing different steps related to this approach is shown in Fig. 1. Download

    The PRISMA flowchart for literature search and selection. Adapted from (Page et
    al., 2021). SCOPUS was selected among different academic databases, given its
    broad coverage of quality peer-reviewed literature related to the topic. Seventeen
    broad-based search strings related to different SDGs were developed to retrieve
    articles from SCOPUS (see Supplementary Appendix I). These strings were informed
    by the method used by McCollum et al. (2018), who studied “energy-related interactions
    between SDGs”. The literature search was conducted at the end of 2022 and returned
    322 articles. After excluding overlaps, 79 articles remained in the database.
    The lead author checked these and excluded ten papers which did not include information
    on the links between smart cities and SDGs. Next, the reference sections of the
    69 remaining papers were checked, and four other relevant papers were added to
    the final database that included 73 documents. In addition to these documents,
    this review relies on other literature related to smart cities and SDGs to interpret
    the study findings. These include references suggested by the reviewers. A deductive
    approach was followed for content analysis. More specifically, a structured Excel
    spreadsheet was developed that specifies what information needs to be extracted.
    These include information on various issues such as the sectoral and geographic
    focus of the study, methodological approaches, direct and indirect linkages to
    SDGs, major smart city dimensions related to the study (these were determined
    based on an earlier research by Sharifi (2019)), co-benefits and trade-offs for
    the SDGs, the consequences of the pandemic, and governance issues. The content
    analysis was conducted in three stages. The first three authors participated in
    the first stage. The lead author reviewed all papers. Simultaneously, the selected
    papers were divided among the second and third authors for separate content analysis.
    In the second stage, the lead author compared his extraction sheet with those
    completed by co-authors to identify areas of disagreement. The last author was
    invited to review the papers where disagreements were found. Finally, considering
    the opinions of all authors, in the third stage, the authors elaborated on the
    areas of disagreement and made a final decision. While there could still be some
    issues due to subjective judgments, this approach has helped improve the data
    extraction accuracy. In addition to the systematic review, a term co-occurrence
    analysis using the VOSviewer software was conducted to gain an overall understanding
    of the reviewed papers. The software has been used to map the knowledge structure
    of different fields (Sharifi, 2021). The outputs of the software are networks
    of nodes and links, where node size is proportional to the frequency of the occurrence
    of the terms, and link width is proportional to the strength of their connection.
    The term map is useful for understanding dominant topics; therefore, it was used
    to complement our systematic review. 3. Results and discussions 3.1. Literature
    overview Of the 73 reviewed papers, 45 are journal articles, 14 are conference
    papers, and 14 are book chapters. While SDGs were launched in 2015, the first
    papers in our database were published in 2017 (No.4). Also, five papers were published
    in the following year. The number of annual publications on this topic has increased
    ever since. Specifically, 10, 20, 23, and 11 papers were published in 2019, 2020,
    2021, and 2022, respectively. In terms of methodological approaches, most studies
    (No.53) are qualitative based on methods such as descriptive analysis, literature
    review, grounded theory, interviews, and consensus-based expert elicitation. The
    rest have adopted mixed-methods and quantitative approaches such as modeling and
    simulation, spatial analysis, multi-criteria analysis, scenario making, energy
    consumption monitoring, and regression analysis. Regarding geographic focus, most
    studies have a generic approach (No. 33). Interestingly, 22 papers are focused
    on cities in developing countries. The rest (No.18) deal with issues related to
    cities in developed countries. To understand the thematic focus, three different
    approaches were adopted, namely, term co-occurrence analysis, exploring sectoral
    linkages, and exploring linkages to smart city dimensions. Results of the term
    co-occurrence analysis (Fig. 2) show that existing literature is mainly focused
    on issues related to Good Health and Well-being (SDG3), Affordable and Clean Energy
    (SDG7), Decent Work and Economic Growth (SDG 8), Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure
    (SDG 9), Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDG11), and Climate Action (SDG 13).

    2. Results of the term co-occurrence analysis. According to Fig. 2, issues related
    to cities and urban planning (e.g., terms such as urban policy, urban growth,
    urban development, urbanization, sustainable city, and planning) are dominant.
    Other dominant areas, according to the term co-occurrence analysis, are energy
    (e.g., energy efficiency, renewable energy, and energy utilization), technologies
    and infrastructure (e.g., IoT, ICT, big data, data mining, machine learning),
    and environmental monitoring and planning (e.g., climate change, environmental
    monitoring, waste management, environmental protection, and air quality). These
    results indicate that relatively more attention has been paid to environmental
    and technological aspects of the interaction between smart cities and SDGs. To
    further explore thematic focus, a content analysis of the reviewed papers was
    done to understand how they address different sectors, SDGs, and smart city dimensions
    (Sharifi, 2020). Results are shown in Fig. 3, Fig. 4. Fig. 3 is based on the primary
    focus of the reviewed papers. In other words, it is based on the primary sector,
    SDG, and smart city dimensions addressed by each paper. This figure shows that
    existing research is primarily focused on urban management, ICT, transportation,
    and energy. Issues related to these sectors have mainly been discussed in the
    context of SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption
    and Production), and SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy). In turn, these are mainly
    linked to three dominant smart city dimensions, namely, environment, governance,
    and mobility. Obviously, considering the primary focus, less attention has been
    paid to linkages between smart city solutions and technologies and socio-economic
    issues. Download : Download high-res image (834KB) Download : Download full-size

    city dimensions addressed by the reviewed papers, and their linkages to different
    SDGs. This figure includes primary, as well as, non-primary focus. As some measures
    could have implications and linkages to multiple SDGs, sectors, and dimensions,
    the overall focus of the reviewed papers was also explored (i.e., primary and
    non-primary). This approach allows considering indirect linkages between sectors,
    SDGs, and dimensions. Results, presented in Fig. 4, indicate that dominant sectors,
    SDGs, and smart city dimensions are almost the same. More specifically, management,
    ICT, and energy are dominant sectors that are linked to dominant SDGs such as
    SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy),
    SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), and SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and
    Production). In turn, these are linked to various dimensions; particularly, environment,
    living, and governance that are dominant. However, an interesting finding is that
    more balanced attention to different SDGs and smart city dimensions can be observed
    when both primary and non-primary linkages are considered. This shows that smart
    city measures can indirectly contribute to different SDGs. The only SDGs that
    have received relatively less attention are SDG 5 (Gender Equality), SDG 14 (Life
    Below Water), SDG 1 (No Poverty), and SDG 4 (Quality Education). Interlinkages
    between smart city solutions and different SDGs are further discussed in the following
    section. 3.2. Interlinkages between smart city solutions and different SDGs As
    was discussed in the previous section, SDGs 11, 7, 8, 12, 3, 13, 10, and 6 have
    received more attention in the literature, indicating their higher relevance to
    smart cities. Therefore, considering the journal''s word limit, these SDGs are
    discussed in detail. The other SDGs will be briefly discussed in the main text,
    and interested readers are referred to Supplementary Appendix II for more details.
    3.2.1. SDG 3: Good health and wellbeing Good health and well-being is an important
    facet of the global development agenda. It is particularly a pertinent issue in
    urban settings where there are many triggers with capacities to compromise the
    health agenda. For instance, factors like a sedentary lifestyle, poor water quality,
    pollution, overcrowding, and food insecurity can contribute to increased unhealthy
    outcomes (Wu et al., 2020). As a result, it would be expected that substantial
    research would be conducted showcasing how the implementation of the smart city
    concept would help accelerate SDG 3. However, from our analysis, only a handful
    of papers directly relate the smart city concept to good health and well-being.
    The implementation of smart cities could provide multiple benefits, such as reduced
    emissions due to emphasis on electric vehicles and the adoption of renewable energy
    (Liu, Yang, & Osmani, 2021), enhanced air and water quality through the utilization
    of machine learning for health assessment (De Las Heras, Luque-Sendra and Zamora-Polo,
    2020a, De Las Heras, Luque-Sendra and Zamora-Polo, 2020b), improved indoor air
    quality using building information modeling systems (Liu et al., 2021), reduced
    congestion and increased share of active transportation via new mobility systems
    such as bike sharing (Moreno, Allam, Chabaud, Gall, & Pratlong, 2021), enhanced
    exchange of healthcare data between various entities (Mora, Mendoza-Tello, Varela-Guzman,
    & Szymanski, 2021), and improved access to healthcare services to vulnerable groups
    (Liaqat, Sajjad, Waseem, & Alhelou, 2021). Some examples are elaborated on in
    the remainder of this section. The installation of diverse sensor-enabled lighting
    technologies in smart cities is argued by Tavares, Ingi, Araújo, Pinho, and Bhusal
    (2021) to enhance good health and well-being, especially concerning the psychological
    effects associated with visual and non-visual perception, including that of safety.
    Availability of outdoor lighting is also linked to reduced road injuries and other
    health challenges directly associated with little or no lighting. However, Foth
    and Caldwell (2018) warn about the negative impacts of artificial lighting on
    animals'' lives. For example, it can cause birds to migrate too early or too late,
    missing the ideal climate conditions for nesting. This is an issue that should
    be considered in the design of smart lighting systems. Smart cities are also hailed
    for promoting clean energy production, which has positive impacts on the health
    and well-being of urban residents (De Las Heras, Luque-Sendra and Zamora-Polo,
    2020a, De Las Heras, Luque-Sendra and Zamora-Polo, 2020b). Another benefit, as
    argued by Varghese, Pathak, and Varde (2021), is help in the reduction of food
    waste in cities, especially using mobile applications supported by smart infrastructures.
    With this application, it was particularly possible to connect suppliers with
    consumers during the height of COVID-19, thus, reducing wastage as well as allowing
    urban residents to have a regular supply which is critical for their health. Optimizing
    waste collection and management using modeling and monitoring systems is another
    contribution of smart solutions that has implications for urban health (Hannan
    et al., 2020). Building Information Modeling can promote health and well-being
    in multiple ways. Through real-time monitoring, it allows timely diagnosis of
    safety threats in buildings and alerts residents and developers of actions that
    need to be taken. Similarly, building information modeling enables better control
    of indoor air quality and improved regulation of building energy use, thereby
    contributing to achieving ‘healthy buildings’ (Liu et al., 2021; Sharifi & Khavarian-Garmsir,
    2022). Ensuring access to healthcare services for vulnerable groups such as the
    elderly and physically challenged is essential for achieving SDG 3. In this regard,
    smart cities can offer novel solutions for providing healthcare through sensor-enabled
    apps for vital sign monitoring, and remote monitoring, surveillance, diagnosis,
    and treatment services (Hussain, Wenbi, da Silva, Nadher, & Mudhish, 2015; Ismagilova,
    Hughes, Dwivedi, & Raman, 2019; Liaqat et al., 2021). Exchanging healthcare data
    between various entities and centers is necessary for the timely and efficient
    provision of remote healthcare services. Such data exchange may, however, result
    in privacy and confidentiality breaches. Blockchain can help address such issues.
    Further, through optimizing supply chain management, blockchain can help address
    issues related to the efficacy loss of medical products such as vaccines (Mora
    et al., 2021). Smart solutions have also proven effective under crisis conditions.
    For instance, digital tools such as tracing apps have been widely used to control
    the spread of COVID-19 (Hassankhani, Alidadi, Sharifi, & Azhdari, 2021; Sharifi,
    Khavarian-Garmsir, & Kummitha, 2021). Blockchain-based platforms have been used
    to track patients securely and keep them anonymous (Mora et al., 2021). Despite
    these merits, smart technologies have also been criticized for promoting technological
    solutionism and undermining the rule of law (Mann, Mitchell, & Foth, 2022). Mann
    et al. (2022) specifically target global technology corporations, such as Google
    and Apple, for compromising the sovereignty and autonomy of states in dealing
    with the pandemic. 3.2.2. SDG 6: Clean water and sanitation Although this goal
    is mentioned in several publications, direct contributions such as real-time monitoring
    of water and wastewater resources, early warning systems, and predictive models
    for water management are rarely explored (Ismagilova et al., 2019). However, some
    co-benefits associated with water management are derived from implementing smart
    cities and technologies such as AI and Blockchain. Among other things, these could
    contribute to more efficient water provision and wastewater management, enhance
    environmental awareness, ensure water security and improve access to safe drinking
    water, and enable cities to deal with the nexus between water, energy, and food
    (Blasi et al., 2022; Mora et al., 2021; Sharifi & Khavarian-Garmsir, 2022; Vinuesa
    et al., 2020). For instance, Parmentola, Petrillo, Tutore, and De Felice (2022)
    show that adopting Blockchain technology in smart cities could help support peer-to-peer
    water rights trading. This could enable the saving of water resources, thereby
    contributing to environmental sustainability (Parmentola et al., 2022). The same
    technology could assist in awarding waste and water management contracts, thereby
    reducing costs and bureaucracies. Blockchain and other AI-based technologies could
    also facilitate autonomous water distribution and management systems that can
    optimize water management in water-stressed areas and sectors. These can contribute
    to monitoring distribution to ensure equitable access to water resources, minimize
    loss, and control quality (Mora et al., 2021). Further, there are projects such
    as Thewaterproject.org and Charitywater.org,1 where blockchain technology has
    been used to raise funding (through donations made by cryptocurrency) to ensure
    access to clean drinking water in sub-Saharan Africa. The technology enables tracking
    and monitoring donations, thereby contributing to transparency. Also, by eliminating
    the need for intermediaries, the technology enables faster and less-costly money
    transfers (Mora et al., 2021). Kutty, Abdella, Kucukvar, Onat, and Bulu (2020)
    argue that smart city platforms can monitor and control water source contamination.
    Further, they can facilitate water recycling, which is essential for achieving
    SDG 6. Blasi et al. (2022) noted that within the smart city platform, it is possible
    to detect and locate leakages and other challenges within the water distribution
    systems and take quick action to curtail related negative impacts quickly and
    effectively. The smart devices deployed within smart cities further increase capacities
    and capabilities to estimate and monitor water usage, water quality, demand, and
    other factors in real time, allowing for comprehensive actions on issues like
    shortages, contaminations, security, and others. Despite these potentials, Kutty
    et al. (2020) highlight that the competition by corporations in their pursuit
    of maximum profits sometimes compromises the provision of social services. As
    such, there are fears that the availability and universal accessibility to clean
    and safe drinking water may not be emphasized enough, especially for informal
    settlements. This form of competition has had serious implications, especially
    during and after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Failing to emphasize the
    achievement of SDG 6 in smart cities would have ripple effects on the achievements
    of other directly related SDGs, such as SDG 2, 3, 7, 11, 12, and 13. 3.2.3. SDG
    7: Affordable and clean energy The SDGs, along with other global accords and documents
    such as the Paris Agreement launched in 2015, strengthen and increase the efforts
    to seek alternative energy generation models. Therefore, it is no surprise that
    promoting renewable energies is at the heart of smart city initiatives (Zaheer,
    2020). This explains why many studies have directly focused on the energy sector.
    The literature has mentioned various benefits of smart city solutions and technologies,
    including reduction of peak loads, demand and consumption optimization, load monitoring
    and forecasting to minimize disruptions, decentralized energy generation, integration
    of renewable energy systems, smart energy storage, enhanced awareness of and control
    over energy consumption, improved efficiency of indoor and outdoor lighting systems,
    and identification and reduction of cases of illegal wiretapping (Blasi et al.,
    2022; Lazaroiu & Roscia, 2018; Liaqat et al., 2021; Ryan et al., 2020; Sharifi
    & Khavarian-Garmsir, 2022). A key benefit is reductions in energy consumption.
    As a case in point, SmartCity Malaga project in Spain reduced electricity consumption
    by 25 % through efficiency improvements and the integration of demand monitoring
    and management systems (De Las Heras, Luque-Sendra and Zamora-Polo, 2020a, De
    Las Heras, Luque-Sendra and Zamora-Polo, 2020b). However, it is essential to highlight
    that the optimization approach and its reported benefits have encountered criticism
    from specific scholars. For instance, Loh, Foth, Caldwell, Garcia-Hansen, and
    Thomson (2020) underscore that the foundation of the optimization perspective
    rests upon assumptions that might not inherently correlate with ecological principles.
    The optimization levels presented by market forces may inadequately apprehend
    the complexities of rebound effects and fail to encompass the entirety of vital
    aspects of life and sustainability (Giampietro & Mayumi, 2018; Loh et al., 2020).
    The benefits of smart solutions have also been examined in other contexts. For
    instance, a simulation study for Mashhad, Iran, demonstrates that Artificial Neural
    Network soft computing can be utilized to predict electrical energy consumption
    with high accuracy. Such models allow smart monitoring and management of energy.
    Further, when coupled with PV systems, they can facilitate the optimization of
    energy systems and ensure urban energy resilience (Ghadami et al., 2021). In another
    simulation study for Amaravati, India, Bardhan, Debnath, Gama, and Vijay (2020)
    demonstrate how Peer-to-Peer (P2P) energy-sharing systems can be developed to
    promote decentralized energy generation (rooftop PV) and combat energy shortages
    that could make it difficult to deal with urban heat in the Global South. This
    will also provide opportunities to improve energy accessibility and affordability,
    with indirect benefits for SDG 10 on inequalities and SDG 3 on health. Blockchain
    technology can be used to optimize such sharing systems by facilitating peer-to-peer
    energy trading between small producers and consumers. This will increase energy
    resilience by helping reduce transmission losses (Parmentola et al., 2022). Some
    blockchain-based tokens, such as SolarCoin and NRGcoin, have been developed that
    can be traded as cryptocurrencies by local energy producers. Such community-based
    trading of renewable energy further contributes to diversifying the energy supply
    and minimizing the risk of supply disruption (Mora et al., 2021). They are also
    conducive to further promotion of renewable energy through implementing alternative
    models such as microgrids (Mora et al., 2021; Parmentola et al., 2022). Overall,
    these could provide new means to promote decentralized and community-based renewable
    energy generation and enhance energy security and resilience (Sharifi & Yamagata,
    2016). Integrating renewable energy into the conventional grid is another key
    benefit of smart cities. Blasi et al. (2022) note that such integration increases
    the capacity of cities to pursue emission reduction agendas. This is made possible
    by the availability of different systems within the smart city frameworks that
    allow small-scale energy production on rooftops. Further, machine learning tools
    and big data analytics can facilitate such integration through real-time load
    prediction and demand-response models (De Las Heras, Luque-Sendra and Zamora-Polo,
    2020a, De Las Heras, Luque-Sendra and Zamora-Polo, 2020b). The smart aspects further
    allow for the adoption of Appliance Level Energy Characterization (ALEC), as mentioned
    by Liaqat et al. (2021), which ultimately allows for achieving SDGs and decarbonization
    targets. The incorporation of renewable energies in cities can also reduce the
    costs of electricity production. This is due to the ubiquitous nature of products
    such as solar panels and storage tools like batteries, which were relatively expensive,
    but have become affordable after the emergence and incorporation of smart technologies
    in cities (Allam, 2020; Dhunny, Allam, Lobine, & Lollchund, 2019; Dhunny, Doorga,
    Allam, Lollchund, & Boojhawon, 2019; Evans, 2020; IRENA, 2019). Another major
    contribution of smart solutions is that the smart grid facilitates real-time communication
    of energy consumption to different stakeholders, enabling better decisions and
    contributing to efficiency enhancement (Lazaroiu & Roscia, 2018). Smart solutions
    such as AI techniques could be used to strengthen the integration of renewable
    energy in smart grids by facilitating the partial matching of demand to times
    when more renewable energy could be generated (e.g., sunny hours) (Ryan et al.,
    2020; Vinuesa et al., 2020). When coupled with smart metering, smart grids could
    also provide other benefits. For instance, Liaqat et al. (2021) explain how smart
    meters and appliance-level energy characterization can help address SDG 7 through
    better awareness of and control over energy consumption and appliance energy intensity.
    Moreover, the integration of smart technologies has the potential to enhance the
    role of prosumers as important contributors to a more sustainable and accessible
    energy transition. In contrast to traditional consumers, prosumers actively participate
    in not only consuming but also generating, storing, and trading energy. This active
    involvement supports efforts toward sustainability within the energy sector and
    makes a significant contribution toward achieving SDGs (Hua et al., 2022). Prosumers
    play a pivotal role in driving the adoption of renewable energy sources and are
    becoming increasingly influential figures in facilitating society''s transition
    toward cleaner energy sources (Hua et al., 2022). Although smart cities offer
    many benefits for SDG 7, proper governance measures are needed to avoid potential
    trade-offs. In the absence of such measures, the broad adoption of renewable sources
    in smart cities could widen inequality gaps, especially concerning people with
    no capacity to shift to renewable energy (Liaqat et al., 2021). Further, as mentioned
    earlier, efficiency improvements could result in rebound effects that could minimize
    the ecological contributions of smart cities. 3.2.4. SDG 8: Decent work and economic
    growth The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the economic system in its entirety,
    with severe impacts on economic growth and job and venture creation. It has caused
    disruptions to production and supply chains and raised insecurities and vulnerabilities.
    As a result, billions of lives have been affected, the global economy has been
    endangered, and achieving the targets of SDG 8 remains uncertain. This is compounded
    by other crises and geopolitical tensions that have direct impacts on per capita
    economic growth, levels of economic productivity, gender equality (SDG 5) in terms
    of productive employment, and efficiency in consumption and production (SDG 12).
    To achieve the targets of SDG 8, many developed countries are increasingly experimenting
    with new economic models aligned with the Circular Economy (CE) and Green Economy
    (GE) (Dong, Liu, & Bian, 2021). These models facilitate key policy objectives
    and smart practices for ensuring economic growth while reducing environmental
    impacts. Regarding resource management, CE requires the use of advanced technologies
    to enhance institutional capacities and reaches, to enable policy reforms based
    on evidence-based decisions and cross-cutting analysis, to upgrade legacy infrastructure,
    and to facilitate financial mechanisms. CE has a key role in achieving SDGs in
    smart cities. Integrating digital and green economies can create significant opportunities
    to develop a knowledge economy and facilitate productivity growth in the infrastructure
    and manufacturing sectors (Savchenko & Borodina, 2020). Such integration is beneficial
    as it improves creativity and productivity, reduces risks, and helps overcome
    spatial accessibility challenges, allowing for more efficient resource management
    and better provision of services to different societal groups (Savchenko & Borodina,
    2020; Truby, 2020). This could also provide opportunities for decoupling economic
    growth and negative environmental impacts (Ismagilova et al., 2019). However,
    the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the greedy desire of large corporations for
    wealth and control and the gap between the ruling class, the privileged class,
    the middle class, and the poor class in many democratic societies, undermining
    decent work and the fair distribution of wealth and cost, and continued economic
    growth. While the bottlenecks and roadblocks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic need
    urgently to be addressed and overcome, the digitalization of the economy in its
    entirety could help deal with this global crisis. In other words, it has been
    claimed that the digital economy has proven instrumental in the battle against
    the COVID-19 pandemic (Sharifi, Khavarian-Garmsir, & Kummitha, 2021). Consequently,
    this crisis has accelerated the rise of e-commerce and the whole process of digital
    transformation across almost all economic sectors. Hence, changes to consumer
    behavior are likely to stay as the economic processes, governmental frameworks,
    and data infrastructure of digital platforms have largely penetrated all economic
    sectors of urban society. These transformations are reorganizing cultural practices
    and socio-technical imaginaries around digital platforms (Poell, Nieborg, & van
    Dijck, 2019). Indeed, platformization is rapidly becoming central in framing new
    discourses and materialities of urban futures (Barns, 2019). Smart solutions can
    facilitate enhanced, simplified, and safer access to banking and finance for small-
    and medium-sized enterprises in developing countries (Truby, 2020). For instance,
    the potential of digital technologies to transform businesses in Africa has already
    been recognized (Lazaroiu & Roscia, 2018). Among different solutions, by accepting
    payment by cryptocurrencies and enabling micro credits, blockchain-based platforms
    offer small businesses and entrepreneurs opportunities to expand their access
    to financial services, mainly available to large businesses in conventional banking
    and financial markets. This can promote further entrepreneurial and innovative
    activities. In addition, Blockchain-based platforms such as Slavefreetrade2 and
    Everglader3 allow consumers to track products to understand if they are original
    and have been sourced ethically. They can also facilitate anonymous reporting
    of working conditions to minimize modern-day slavery, thereby contributing to
    more decent and dignified working conditions in the long run (Mora et al., 2021).
    Proper governance and regulatory mechanisms are needed to ensure just and effective
    implementation of such platforms. For instance, the implementation of the Markets
    in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA) establishes standardized market rules for crypto-assets
    within the European Union. This regulatory framework addresses crypto-assets that
    currently lack regulation under existing financial services legislation.4 By regulating
    public offerings of crypto-assets and promoting consumer awareness about associated
    risks, MiCA aims to uphold market integrity and enhance financial stability. Such
    regulatory frameworks should also be implemented in other contexts. Another important
    contribution is that the operational efficiency facilitated by smart technologies
    offers opportunities to save costs and allocate more budget to activities that
    can facilitate local economic growth. For instance, Hannan et al. (2020) demonstrated
    that solid waste collection optimization using modeling and monitoring systems
    could yield significant cost savings. However, if not implemented with sustainable
    development in mind, smart solutions could deepen the inequality gaps in society.
    Therefore, capacity development programs are needed to ensure all social groups
    have the necessary skills to utilize smart solutions to improve their quality
    of life and contribute to economic productivity (Truby, 2020). 3.2.5. SDG 10:
    Reduced inequalities Reducing inequality is one of the key aspects of social sustainability.
    The UN highlights the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the progress
    toward SDG 10 (UN, 2022). Emerging technologies can promote social, economic,
    and political inclusion by enabling participatory mechanisms and democratic processes,
    adopting more responsive social policies that promote equality, improving the
    regulation of global institutions, and ensuring equal job and social opportunities
    (Ismagilova et al., 2019; Masik, Sagan, & Scott, 2021). Concerning the latter,
    Batty et al. (2012) highlight the need for emerging technologies to improve accessibility
    to job and social opportunities. In addition, ICT contributes to evaluating and
    monitoring the progress of SDG 10 like other SDGs. For instance, AI can identify
    inequality in the distribution of resources and access to services and help monitor
    changes over time (Vinuesa et al., 2020). Blockchain is a specific technology
    that can reduce inequalities. It can improve the transparency of donation and
    fundraising programs, allowing donors to monitor how their donations are used
    and how impactful they are. This will increase people''s trust in social organizations
    and is likely to result in more donations (Mora et al., 2021). Through reducing
    transaction costs, using cryptocurrencies, blockchain platforms such as Bitpesa
    in Kenya have facilitated more remittances to developing countries. Such remittances
    are essential for strengthening the local economy and empowering vulnerable social
    groups (Mora et al., 2021). Further, in some contexts, such as Estonia, blockchain-based
    digital IDs have been given to migrants and refugees to track their access to
    financial resources, healthcare services, and employment opportunities, thereby
    reducing inequalities (Mora et al., 2021). Despite multiple potential benefits,
    some studies have challenged the claim that smart cities can provide quality services
    to all citizens. Luusua, Ylipulli, Foth, and Aurigi (2023) raise major concerns
    about privacy, security, and social equity. There are some doubts about the ability
    of AI-enabled software and decision algorithms to predict human behavior and make
    just decisions regarding recruitment and resource allocation. Such technologies''
    inherent bias and lack of transparency and accountability could result in flawed
    and discriminatory practices (Mhlanga, 2022; Vinuesa et al., 2020). There are
    also concerns that smart cities could exacerbate the digital divide, gentrification,
    and marginalization of low-income groups (Blasi et al., 2022; Kolotouchkina, Barroso,
    & Sánchez, 2022; Kourtit, Elmlund, & Nijkamp, 2020; Lam & Ma, 2019). Toli and
    Murtagh (2020) argue that it is unclear whether smart solutions benefit a specific
    “elitist” part of society or prioritize a certain societal group that is digitally
    skilled or can afford these solutions over others. There are also concerns that
    the increasing reliance on automation could have implications for old jobs (Vinuesa
    et al., 2020). Such concerns need attention since problems such as digital exclusion
    and digital divide exist even in developed countries (Acilar & Sæbø, 2023; Elena-Bucea,
    Cruz-Jesus, Oliveira, & Coelho, 2021; Skill, Wihlborg, & Kaharevic, 2020). The
    conditions are likely to be worse in developing countries. Context-sensitive and
    locally-driven smart city initiatives and technological transfer to developing
    countries are essential to ensure smart technologies will not worsen inequalities
    between developed and developing countries (Mhlanga, 2022; Vinuesa et al., 2020).
    3.2.6. SDG 11: Sustainable cities and communities Cities have the unique ability
    to catalyze significant societal changes by fostering connections between sustainable
    development and technological innovation. The widespread urbanization and growth
    of smart solutions are global trends that have the potential to greatly impact
    our way of life in unprecedented ways (Jain, Gue, & Jain, 2023). The importance
    of developing innovative solutions to address sustainable development challenges
    is evident in SDG 11 (Alagirisamy & Ramesh, 2022; Tura & Ojanen, 2022). Indeed,
    advanced ICT is instrumental in protecting the environment, optimizing resource
    efficiency, upgrading infrastructure, promoting socio-economic development, and
    advancing human knowledge in cities (Grossi & Trunova, 2021; Visvizi and del Hoyo,
    2021a, Visvizi and del Hoyo, 2021b). Advanced ICT and IoT offer cutting-edge solutions
    for optimizing and enhancing the sustainability of urban areas. This includes
    improving various aspects related to urban planning, design, operations, and governance.
    The integration of ICT/IoT in sustainable cities addresses the growing requirement
    for novel approaches to achieve long-term environmental sustainability and address
    challenges such as air pollution, safety, resource management, etc. (Almalki et
    al., 2021; Sharifi, Khavarian-Garmsir, Allam, & Asadzadeh, 2023). These solutions
    are associated with inclusivity, safety, resilience, efficiency, equity, and quality
    of life as key objectives of SDG 11. Despite these merits, as Powell (2021) warns,
    the optimization approach may overlook social and environmental concerns and restrict
    citizen involvement in shaping innovative city projects. Smart city solutions
    enabled by big data analytics could help cities deal with complex and dynamic
    interactions between different factors that are not easily addressed by static
    and linear models (Kourtit et al., 2020). Technologies such as drone-based sensing,
    deep learning, data sensing and analytics, Blockchain, and AI-enabled real-time
    monitoring of urban functions (e.g., energy and water consumption) are necessary
    for optimizing urban management and enhancing resilience, as shown in different
    cities such as Casablanca, New Delhi, and New Castle (Corbett & Mellouli, 2017;
    Parmentola et al., 2022; Thangavelu, 2020). Similarly, 3D urban environment models
    contribute to an enhanced understanding of urban phenomena such as pollution,
    flood risk, land use, urban form, and even socio-economic features (Santos, Deus,
    Rocha, & Tenedório, 2021; Wang, Hou, Miller, Brown, & Jiang, 2019). Nevertheless,
    arguments regarding the positive implications of big data analytics have not been
    uniformly affirmative, and some concerns have also been raised. For instance,
    Rittenbruch et al. (2022) delve into critiquing big data analytics and indicate
    that tensions exist between transparency and opacity, accuracy and uncertainty,
    and objectivity and subjectivity. They emphasize the necessity for algorithmic
    accountability, which is a significant mechanism for ensuring augmented transparency
    and confidence. A sector that has received much attention within the context of
    SDG 11 is urban mobility. Cryptocurrency-based car- and bike-sharing platforms
    such as FiarBike have been developed to promote shared mobility. Such platforms
    can also be used to collect finance for the maintenance and further development
    of shared mobility infrastructure. Other smart solutions, such as smartphone apps,
    have also contributed to the promotion of active and public transportation (Garber,
    Watkins, & Kramer, 2019; Mora et al., 2021). Smart solutions could also facilitate
    modal shift via car- and bike-sharing programs, reduce the need for travel and
    commuting by promoting online shopping and automated delivery, and improve the
    safety of pedestrians and cyclists by using sensors (El Hamdani, Benamar, & Younis,
    2020; Huang, Thomas, Groenewolt, & van Berkum, 2022; Moreno et al., 2021). Collectively,
    these could promote proximity-based urban planning and active transportation with
    co-benefits for health and climate change mitigation (Moreno et al., 2021; Sharifi,
    Pathak, Joshi, & He, 2021). Automated transport is another key feature of smart
    cities. If planned and implemented properly and by considering urban-rural linkages,
    it can strengthen the connection between cities and their hinterland and promote
    regional growth (Soe, 2020). Well-planned automated transport could also enhance
    the accessibility of women, children, and the elderly. It can also improve road
    safety and reduce the environmental impacts of cities by decreasing the number
    of vehicles on roads and associated CO2 emissions (Grindsted, Christensen, Freudendal-Pedersen,
    Friis, & Hartmann-Petersen, 2022; Soe, 2020). However, poor implementation of
    transport automation will have negative effects as it could increase congestion
    and emissions (Grindsted et al., 2022; Soe, 2020). Some argue that Autonomous
    Vehicles (AVs) are likely to generate rebound effects and increase car dependence,
    thereby increasing emissions and negatively impacting human health (Blasi et al.,
    2022; Grindsted et al., 2022). Integrating AVs with MaaS and Public transport
    policies could mitigate these issues (Grindsted et al., 2022). Indeed, AVs could
    further promote car sharing (Grindsted et al., 2022). Smart technologies have
    the potential to both enhance and adversely impact urban governance. Better interaction
    between people and urban authorities can be achieved through blockchain-based
    platforms that are less bureaucratic and can enhance citizen trust as the security
    of data collected via smart IoT tools and stored in blockchain platforms can be
    ensured. Such platforms further optimize interactions by enhancing speed and efficiency
    and minimizing corruption through traceability features (Mora et al., 2021). Urban
    authorities can use blockchain to collect taxes more efficiently and also verify
    information sent by taxpayers, thereby increasing municipalities'' revenues (Makani,
    Pittala, Alsayed, Aloqaily, & Jararweh, 2022; Mora et al., 2021). However, on
    the dark side, Sheikh, Mitchell, and Foth (2023) point out that smart technologies
    can have negative implications for urban governance by prioritizing efficiency
    and data collection over the well-being of diverse species and ecosystems. According
    to the authors, this can shift attention away from the needs and perspectives
    of nonhuman life and may delay actions toward sustainable development. Smart cities
    could also cause issues such as disempowerment, marginalization, social exclusion,
    discrimination, governance corporatization, algorithmic bias, technocratic reductionism,
    techno-centricity, dataveillance, geosurveillance, privacy loss, cybersecurity
    risks, and democratic backsliding. These have been exacerbated following the COVID-19
    pandemic due to the massive deployment of invasive technologies. Nevertheless,
    the COVID-19 crisis provides a great window of opportunity for policymakers to
    undertake transformative endeavors toward creating more just, resilient, safe,
    and sustainable cities (Amirzadeh, Sobhaninia, Buckman, & Sharifi, 2023; Sharifi,
    2023; Sharifi & Khavarian-Garmsir, 2020). 3.2.7. SDG 12: Responsible consumption
    and production SDG 12 is at the heart of natural environment and resources management
    for driving sustainable economic development. This implies that it is strongly
    linked to multiple SDGs, including SDGs 11, 13, 7, and 9. It is of particular
    importance in global efforts to achieve environmental sustainability. SDG 12 has
    stimulated many opportunities for innovation under the “sustainable innovation”
    agenda. In this regard, new technologies play a crucial role in optimizing the
    utilization of natural resources and advancing our understanding and prevention
    of environmental issues. Smart cities rely on ICT and its applied innovative solutions
    to monitor, understand, analyze, and plan resource consumption patterns across
    different urban systems and domains (Charfeddine & Umlai, 2023; Irajifar, Chen,
    Lak, Sharifi, & Cheshmehzangi, 2023). These efforts also contribute to achieving
    climate goals associated with SGD13 (Charfeddine & Umlai, 2023; Ismagilova et
    al., 2019). The smart city approach based on the use of Artificial Intelligence
    of Things (AIoT) and related automated processes is highly significant to advancing
    the model of Circular Economy (CE). For instance: the optimization of wastewater
    management can be enabled by the automation of the harvested rainwater collection
    in buildings, smart grid technologies can contribute to circularity through energy
    reduction and conservation using different means, product utilization can be maximized
    through pool sharing, e-waste can be reduced through replacement cycle and refurbishment,
    and recycled plastic waste can be boosted through virtual platforms (Siddiqui
    & Pandit, 2021). Smart solutions can contribute to sustainable consumption and
    production by improving solid waste management (Pardini, Rodrigues, Kozlov, Kumar,
    & Furtado, 2019). In this regard, Hannan et al. (2020) proposed a mixed-integer
    linear programming model utilizing Fixed Routing Optimization and Variable Routing
    Optimization for the optimization of solid waste collection (SWC). They focused
    on using bin monitoring as a smart solution to shift from a fixed route solid
    waste collection planning to variable route planning. Their study showed considerable
    optimization benefits with implications for multiple SDGs, including SDGs 7, 11,
    12, and 13. Speaking of SDG 7 and its relation to SDG 13, Bibri and Krogstie (2020)
    investigated the innovative role of data-driven smart solutions in the context
    of smart cities. They found that the combined use and consideration of smart grids,
    smart meters, smart buildings and appliances, smart environmental monitoring,
    and smart urban metabolism can yield synergetic benefits. The benefits include
    energy efficiency improvement, renewable energy adoption, pollution reduction,
    and real-time energy and material flow feedback. For example, smart metering infrastructure
    can contribute to responsible consumption by optimizing consumers'' energy consumption
    behaviors (Liaqat et al., 2021). Worth pointing out is that urban metabolism (UM)
    is of central focus in CE as a model that is used to understand and analyze the
    energy and material flow in urban environments. UM refers to “the total sum of
    the technical and socioeconomic processes that occur in cities, resulting in growth,
    production of energy, and elimination of waste.” (Kennedy, Cuddihy, & Engel-Yan,
    2007). Smart urban metabolism (SUM) is an evolution of urban metabolism enabled
    by advanced ICT (see Bibri and Krogstie (2020) for a case study analysis and a
    detailed discussion). Further, one dimension of UM is the use of dynamic and high-resolution
    meter data for the evaluation of energy consumption and waste production in buildings.
    This involves the use of Building Information Modeling (BIM) as a tool for improving
    efficiency and reducing waste. For instance, BIM helps reduce construction waste
    (Liu et al., 2021). As an innovative technology, BIM can be used to enhance design
    efficiency and quality, collaboration between stakeholders, data exchange, design
    communication, and information sharing (Liu et al., 2021; Pereira, Santos, Leite,
    & Escórcio, 2021). Blockchain technology can also contribute to SDG 12. Its novelty
    lies in enabling new methods for green energy production, “monitoring and storing
    data related activities responsible for pollution and environmental degradation,
    and real-time collection and analysis of green or low carbon data for timely decision
    making” (Parmentola et al., 2022). Further, it can oversee the groundwater of
    urban areas, monitor EV charging systems (Parmentola et al., 2022), inform “consumers
    about less-efficient appliances in their premises” (Liaqat et al., 2021), and
    monitor compliance with sustainability standards. The latter can be achieved through
    product traceability which can also reduce resource inefficiencies and losses
    at the different stages of supply chain (Mora et al., 2021). Despite these benefits,
    the high energy requirements for AI applications in the case of the use of non
    carbon-neutral sources of energy could undermine the efforts to achieve the goal
    of Climate Action (SDG 13) (Vinuesa et al., 2020). 3.2.8. SDG 13: Climate action
    SDG 13 on climate action pertains particularly to cities as major contributors
    to GHG emissions (Aboagye and Sharifi, 2023, Aboagye and Sharifi, 2024; Lwasa
    et al., 2022). According to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
    Change (UNFCCC), enabling city governments to effectively handle data management
    challenges will be crucial in achieving the decarbonization agenda. While the
    nexus between ICT and climate change has been a topic of great interest since
    the early 2000s, it was not until recently that it became important in the context
    of smart cities. This nexus spans various urban domains associated with high emission
    levels, such as transportation, energy, building, industry, and waste. Bibri and
    Krogstie (2020) provide a set of data-driven strategies and pathways for energy
    efficiency and pollution reduction as solutions for advancing the environmental
    sustainability of smart cities. These are based on the overarching strategy “resource
    efficiency and climate responsibility” that is to be adopted by sustainable smart
    cities that aim to reduce GHG emissions to a level below 1 ton per inhabitant
    by 2030 and to become fossil fuel-free and climate-positive by 2050. This entails
    reducing energy consumption and carbon footprint as well as using digitalization
    and “new technologies to make it easier for citizens and businesses to be environmentally
    friendly.” Regarding emerging models of urbanism, Moreno et al. (2021) emphasize
    the potential role of digitalization in improving the different sustainability
    aspects of the 15-Minute city, as digital technologies have the potential to enable
    cities to optimize and improve service delivery by significantly reducing the
    time needed for citizens to accomplish social functions, thereby saving time from
    mobility and traffic and hence reducing emissions from vehicles which in turn
    save urban environments. The 15-minute city model can also offer multiple other
    co-benefits for economic, environmental, and social sustainability (Khavarian-Garmsir,
    Sharifi, Hajian Hossein Abadi, & Moradi, 2023; Khavarian-Garmsir, Sharifi, & Sadeghi,
    2023). AI and other advanced technologies for modeling and monitoring have also
    shown great potential for waste collection optimization through fixed and variable
    routing optimization (Hannan et al., 2020). This also has significant benefits
    for multiple SDGs, namely SDGs 3, 6, 11, and 14, both directly and indirectly
    (Hannan et al., 2020). AI applications have the potential to contribute greatly
    to environmental sustainability. They can analyze large-scale databases, allowing
    for joint actions in preserving the environment. AI can also help improve our
    understanding of climate change and model its potential impacts. Additionally,
    it enables high integration of renewable energy sources and smart energy systems,
    enhancing ecosystem health and supporting circular economies. Furthermore, AI
    aids in creating efficient resource usage within low-carbon cities (Vinuesa et
    al., 2020). Such contributions also provide co-benefits for SDGs 7, 11, and 13
    (Vinuesa et al., 2020). Furthermore, data sharing among consumers and third parties
    enables novel services, such as energy management, which support low-carbon practices
    and options. Also, data sharing among third parties and other stakeholders enables
    innovative services for smart cities and helps achieve the objectives of sustainable
    development and decarbonization (Liaqat et al., 2021). As regards blockchain,
    a number of solutions have been proposed or developed, including its use to address
    and improve the management of the emission trading and auditing schemes (Lu et
    al., 2022; Parmentola et al., 2022), to provide credible trading services for
    polluters (Parmentola et al., 2022), to facilitate public participation in addressing
    the challenges of climate change, and to tokenize carbon credits (Mora et al.,
    2021). Concerning emission monitoring, the integration of blockchain and the IoT
    provides reliability to the available data and establishes the homogeneity of
    measurement criteria, which in turn “minimize registration errors and eliminate
    fraud arising from the accounting and measurement of gas emissions” (Mora et al.,
    2021). In terms of trade-offs, the use of advanced ICT involves direct effects
    on the environment. In this respect, large computing centers, which provide massive
    computational resources required by AI technology research, design, and development,
    are associated with significant energy consumption and, thus, carbon footprint,
    compromising SDGs 7 and 13 (Vinuesa et al., 2020). Moreover, the domination of
    technocratic approaches in planning systems is criticized by some scholars, like
    Yigitcanlar, Foth, and Kamruzzaman (2019), who noted that focusing solely on these
    approaches in urban innovation has left planning systems ill-equipped to address
    underlying environmental issues. Therefore, comprehensive reform in governance
    and politics is necessary to advance urban innovations. In this regard, Fieuw,
    Foth, and Caldwell (2022) advocate for moving beyond a narrow focus on technological
    solutions and instead adopting a more systemic approach that addresses the root
    causes of climate change, such as social and economic inequality, unsustainable
    consumption patterns, and the exploitation of natural resources. They argue that
    this approach can help promote multispecies justice and cohabitation and lead
    to more equitable and sustainable urban environments for all. Overall, ICT can
    pose risks to environmental sustainability. These risks go beyond direct effects,
    also encompassing indirect effects, systemic effects, and rebound effects. 3.2.9.
    Key issues related to other SDGs 3.2.9.1. SDG 1 The other SDGs have received relatively
    less attention in the literature. However, the reported evidence shows that smart
    city solutions and technologies can also be linked to SDGs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 15,
    15, 16, and 17. It is possible to infer from the reviewed literature that smart
    city solutions and technologies can indirectly contribute to alleviating poverty
    (SDG 1). It is argued that ICT infrastructure and artificial intelligence could
    lead to economic growth and facilitate the provision of food and other services,
    thereby contributing to poverty eradication (Joia & Kuhl, 2019; Vinuesa et al.,
    2020). Policymakers can utilize mart solutions such as big data analytics and
    image processing to identify poverty areas, find out the root causes of poverty,
    and explore scenarios for empowering vulnerable groups by ensuring better access
    to resources and services (Ismagilova et al., 2019; Vinuesa et al., 2020). Efficiency
    improvement and operational optimization are other contributions that could help
    address poverty issues. However, inequality trade-offs may emerge if smart cities
    are not implemented following the principles of social justice (Joia & Kuhl, 2019).
    3.2.9.2. SDG 2 Smart city technologies could also contribute to minimizing hunger
    (SDG 2) through innovative planning approaches, especially in relation to developing
    countries. Among other things, smart technologies can contribute to reducing food
    waste (Ahmadzadeh, Ajmal, Ramanathan, & Duan, 2023; Varghese et al., 2021), promoting
    innovation and behavioral change (Baena et al., 2020), and enabling more efficient
    data-driven ways of agricultural production, biodiversity protection, food conservation,
    crop forecasting, and soil management, all of which are essential for achieving
    zero hunger (Ryan et al., 2020). Achieving such contributions depends on the availability
    of just and effective governance mechanisms. Otherwise, the uneven distribution
    of smart technologies, such as AI-enabled agricultural equipment, would make it
    challenging to reduce hunger, particularly in developing countries (Vinuesa et
    al., 2020). 3.2.9.3. SDG 4 Smart technologies are increasingly used to ensure
    quality education in cities. The decentralization features of technologies such
    as Blockchain offer opportunities to improve access to education services and
    learning materials. Smart technologies are also becoming increasingly important
    in managing, improving, and evaluating educational systems. These technologies
    offer a range of tools and techniques that can support these processes effectively
    (Nikitin, Lantsev, Nugaev, & Yakovleva, 2016; Spector, 2016). Other potential
    contributions are minimizing private education costs, facilitating self-learning
    and creative education, enabling e-learning, and providing life-long education
    opportunities (Iqbal, Parra-Saldivar, Zavala-Yoe, & Ramirez-Mendoza, 2020). Despite
    multiple potential contributions, equality remains a major constraint on access
    to platforms enabled by smart technologies. Digital accessibility should be enhanced
    to minimize quality trade-offs pertinent to SDG 4. 3.2.9.4. SDG 5 Gender equality
    (SDG 5), inclusion/exclusion, and access are areas where the conflicts among the
    global agendas of SDGs are particularly evident in the context of smart cities
    (Sagaris & Tiznado-Aitken, 2020). Hatuka and Zur (2020) argue that the initiatives
    that address inequality in smart cities are still at the margins, calling for
    shifting the focus from the city to society in developing digital initiatives
    and cultivating smart social urbanism. In particular, achieving the objectives
    of SDG 5 entails improving the use of ICT as a set of enabling technologies to
    promote the empowerment of women and adopting and strengthening sound policies
    that promote gender equality. One major trade-off mentioned in the literature
    is regarding the potential reproduction of social biases against women by machine-learning
    algorithms that rely on information available online (Lo Piano, 2020; Vinuesa
    et al., 2020). Better training of such algorithms is needed to avoid such issues.
    Diversifying the AI workforce and better inclusion of women could also be helpful
    (Vinuesa et al., 2020). 3.2.9.5. SDG 9 Smart cities offer unparalleled opportunities
    for the attainment of SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure), as they
    provide platforms that allow diverse innovations to emerge and be advanced. These
    innovations boost the urban economy and benefit multiple sectors, including industry
    and infrastructure (Ismagilova et al., 2020). Among different smart technologies,
    Blockchain has been highlighted in the literature for its capacity to enable green
    production and facilitate greener supply chain and logistics (Parmentola et al.,
    2022). It can also strengthen the innovative capacity of low-income economies
    by offering innovative finance and banking models where, for instance, people
    in developed countries can provide small loans to small and medium enterprises
    in developing countries using cryptocurrencies (Mora et al., 2021). However, investing
    in resilient infrastructure and implementing industrial innovation could be costly,
    making it challenging for local governments to achieve other goals. W. Powell,
    Foth, Cao, and Natanelov (2022) identify several challenges associated with using
    blockchain technology. They warn that significant volumes of energy are required
    to validate transactions and maintain the blockchain, which can have negative
    environmental impacts. Another challenge is the lack of standardization and interoperability
    between different blockchain systems, which can limit their effectiveness in achieving
    sustainable development goals. Additionally, there is a need for greater awareness
    and understanding of blockchain technology among stakeholders, including policymakers,
    businesses, and communities, to ensure that it is used in a responsible and ethical
    manner. These are key trade-offs that need to be addressed. 3.2.9.6. SDG 14 Through
    its innovative solutions, smart cities can provide tools for carefully managing
    resources that regulate human needs, including water resources. Among other things,
    AI can play a key role in preventing and reducing marine pollution through the
    automatic identification techniques enabled by emerging powerful algorithms (Vinuesa
    et al., 2020). Coastal waters are being continuously polluted, exacerbating the
    detrimental effects of ocean acidification on ecosystems and biodiversity. This
    pollution is negatively impacting small-scale fisheries (UN, 2022). To address
    some of these issues, blockchain mechanisms are being implemented “to monitor
    water pollution and preserve marine resources” (Parmentola et al., 2022). Blockchain
    technology has been utilized in reward programs where fishermen or coastal residents
    are provided with cryptocurrency tokens. These tokens can be later exchanged for
    credit, enabling them to collect and share data regarding the environmental conditions
    of water bodies. This valuable information can contribute to improving decision-making
    processes, designing effective regulations, and supporting platforms dedicated
    to safeguarding coral reefs (Mora et al., 2021). Other potential contributions
    of smart solutions to SDG 14 are explained in Supplementary Appendix II. 3.2.9.7.
    SDG 15 Implementation of the smart city concept can help achieve the goals captured
    in SDG 15 (Life of Land), especially regarding halting and reversing land degradation
    and slowing biodiversity loss. However, our analysis showcases that there was
    no research work directly focused on SDG 15 (see Fig. 3). Notwithstanding, as
    detailed in Supplementary Appendix II, it can be argued that many activities and
    projects initiated in smart cities, particularly in sectors like transport, manufacturing,
    and energy, can have significant impacts on promoting the protection and restoration
    of various ecosystems such as terrestrial areas and forests. However, some of
    the smart city programs, such as the installation of city-wide lighting systems,
    as noted in the article by Tavares et al. (2021), prompt negative impacts on different
    ecosystems, thus exposing the negative side of smart cities, especially in pursuit
    of SDGs 14, 15, 2, 3, and 6. 3.2.9.8. SDG 16 This goal is a critical goal for
    urban planning, as it can help streamline agendas such as governance, education,
    and livability. It emphasizes the need to build effective, accountable, and inclusive
    institutions, which were often neglected in previous urban planning models. Justice
    and strong institutions are essential for tackling urban issues, such as human
    rights violations, violence, climate change, and cost of living, which have led
    to severe consequences such as human displacements and terrorism (Artusio et al.,
    2017). Smart technologies, such as Blockchain and AI, offer promising solutions
    for implementing SDG 16 in urban areas. For instance, Blockchain can provide credible
    platforms for registering and storing information related to vulnerable groups,
    while AI can enable e-voting and facial recognition for democratization and security
    (Allam, 2018; Ismagilova et al., 2020; Moura & Gomes, 2017). However, smart technologies
    also pose challenges and risks, such as data privacy, algorithmic bias, and corporate
    manipulation. Human interventions, especially through policies and regulatory
    frameworks, are required to complement the use of smart technologies and ensure
    their ethical and responsible application. Pre-emptive legislation is recommended
    to prevent the misuse of smart technologies that would compromise the achievement
    of SDG 16 in urban areas. Stronger institutions are also needed that adhere to
    transparency and accountability principles in deploying smart technologies in
    urban affairs (Truby, 2020). Overall, SDG 16 is a relevant and timely goal for
    urban planning, as well as an opportunity and a challenge for smart technologies.
    A balanced and integrated approach that combines smart technologies with human
    interventions is advocated to ensure urban sustainability, resilience, and innovation.
    3.2.9.9. SDG 17 Regarding the Partnership for the Goals (SDG 17), the smart city
    agenda has the potential to engender key partnership aspects through an elaborate
    interconnectedness of services and actors, allowing residents, urban authorities,
    service providers, and other stakeholders to collaborate toward creating resilient
    social-ecological-technological systems (Ismagilova et al., 2019; Sharifi, 2023;
    Sharifi & Allam, 2021). According to Drapalova and Wegrich (2020), the need for
    collaboration is important not only for the achievement of SDG 17 but for all
    the other individual SDGs. In cities, collaboration could be viewed via different
    dimensions, including technologies and innovations, sharing of information and
    data, and knowledge transfer. However, despite the promises, there has been an
    increasing concern regarding the lack of standardization of protocols and frameworks
    to guide the manufacturing and deployment of smart devices and objects (Sethi
    & Sarangi, 2017). As such, implementing smart cities has been expensive, as smart
    device manufacturers maintained their unique proprietary standards, meaning that
    other devices cannot be seamlessly integrated (Nelson, Toth, Linders, Nguyen,
    & Rhee, 2019). This is a key trade-off that needs attention. 4. Conclusions The
    world has experienced unprecedented growth in population during the past decades.
    In the meantime, climate change has become a key threat to human security. These
    phenomena have exacerbated numerous challenges, especially in the urban realm,
    prompting the global community to seek sustainable solutions. This motivated the
    introduction of the 17 SDGs in 2015. Long before the launch of the SDGs, there
    was an interest in the global arena in adopting smart solutions and technologies
    for solving global issues (Anthopoulos, 2017; Sharifi, Allam, Feizizadeh, & Ghamari,
    2021). Protagonists of smart cities argue that smart solutions could solve a majority
    of urban challenges, with some arguing that they have the potential to accelerate
    the achievement of the SDGs (Joia & Kuhl, 2019). This systematic review demonstrated
    that responsible development and implementation of smart city solutions and technologies
    could contribute to the progress toward sustainable development goals. Most studies
    examining the linkages have been published in the past two years, indicating that
    this field is emergent. Although indirect linkages between all SDGs and smart
    city solutions can be established, the analysis showed that the focus is mainly
    on SDGs 11, 12, 7, 6, and 4. More work on other SDGs is, therefore, needed. A
    key finding is a bias toward reporting positive contributions. This has also been
    highlighted in other studies related to SDGs (Vinuesa et al., 2020). As Table
    1 shows, among other things, the benefits include accelerating economic growth,
    improving efficiency, enhancing managerial practices, strengthening innovation,
    and raising citizen awareness. Overall, in the literature, the benefits of smart
    cities outweigh the trade-offs. However, we found that potential trade-offs and
    challenges related to privacy and cyber security, costs of infrastructure upgrading,
    the risk of the increased cost of living, the digital divide and lack of skills,
    rebound effects, biased decision-making, reproduction of social biases, and the
    limited legal setup can also occur. Table 1. A summary of major co-benefits and
    trade-offs related to each SDG. SDG Major direct benefits Major indirect benefits

    et al., 2019; Nelson et al., 2019; Sethi & Sarangi, 2017; Sharifi & Allam, 2021)
    Overcoming the challenges requires government interventions and multi-scale governance
    mechanisms to ensure balanced growth and avoid disproportionate impacts on some
    societal groups. Developing standard and interoperable formats for secure data
    collection and exchange is one solution that could offer opportunities for the
    engagement of different groups and stakeholders in smart cities, thereby enhancing
    the prospect of contribution to SDGs (Liaqat et al., 2021). Stakeholder engagement
    and consultation could ensure that smart solutions can meet the needs of people.
    A key challenge is the potential misuse of AI and the risk of biased decision-making
    toward certain societal groups. Indeed, many smart solutions and technologies,
    such as those based on AI, are still in their incipient stages. Effective governance
    and regulatory measures are needed to ensure they will not undermine the achievement
    of SDGs (Truby, 2020). Preventing this requires transparency with algorithms and
    training programs (Truby, 2020), government interventions to ensure that AI is
    human-centered (Mhlanga, 2022), developing ethical standards and regular auditing
    to ensure compliance with them, and measures to regulate surveillance technologies
    and practices of governments and corporations (Truby, 2020). The COVID-19 crisis
    and other syndemics will have far-reaching implications for surveillance society,
    with potential implications for achieving SDGs. As Kitchin (2020) argued, this
    crisis “was an opportunity for the state to further roll-out and normalize surveillance
    technologies and there is little sense that the tracking implemented there will
    be rolled-back post-crisis.” The surveillance system deployed to combat the COVID-19
    pandemic will become part of the “new normal” in digitally monitoring and governing
    societies. This may result in mass surveillance practiced mainly by big tech companies
    and in legitimating tyranny by democratic states, thereby eroding civil liberties
    related to privacy and democracy. At the core of the “new normal” is the intensification
    of the hyper-connectivity, datafication, algorithmization, and platformization
    of the social organization resulting from all kinds of interactions and activities
    that citizens perform as part of everyday life in smart cities. Platformization
    refers to “the penetration of infrastructures, economic processes, and governmental
    frameworks of digital platforms in different economic sectors and spheres of life,
    as well as the reorganization of cultural practices and imaginations around these
    platforms” (Poell et al., 2019). Platforms as an ideological formation are associated
    with smart cities and sharing economy (Barta & Neff, 2016). They steer both platform-based
    user interactions as well as economic transactions (Poell et al., 2019), which
    are associated with the governance dimension of platformization (Gorwa, 2019).
    Major companies have actively repurposed their platforms and data to tackle the
    COVID-19 pandemic and potential future syndemics. For instance, Google, Meta,
    Apple, and Microsoft have developed initiatives to monitor the effects of interventionist
    measures globally and facilitate contact tracing. They have also generated and
    shared real-time location and mobility data (Brandom & Robertson, 2020; Kitchin,
    2020). However, some criticisms underscore the concerns surrounding the involvement
    of these big companies in public health measures and the potential implications
    for governance and autonomy. For instance, some scholars criticized the Google-Apple
    Exposure Notification (GAEN) framework for promoting a technocratic solution and
    challenging state sovereignty (Mann et al., 2022; Mann, Mitchell, Foth, & Anastasiu,
    2020). Overall, the emergence of these solutionist technologies has led to the
    development of new approaches in management and governance. In fact, the utilization
    of surveillance technologies has made social and spatial sorting more commonplace.
    A rigid techno-dystopian stance is one of the socio-spatial implications of platform-mediated
    urban everyday life and urban futures (Strüver & Bauriedl, 2022). Indeed, the
    new routines of social and spatial sorting have “the potential to permanently
    shift the nature of governmentality and to also act as a pathway towards authoritarian
    forms of governance where technology is used to actively impose the will of the
    state onto citizens” (Kitchin, 2020). This has entrenched the wrong idea that
    the techno-managerialist mode of governing by code in smart cities is the only
    option to go, with no alternative scenario. It has been promoted as the most effective
    and efficient way to manage citizens through the systemic collection and algorithmic
    processing of data for decision-making purposes that exclude political action.
    These forms of algorithmic technocratic governance are set to cement and normalize
    the governmental logic of capture and control instead of surveillance and discipline.
    Regulatory frameworks and transparency of algorithms are, therefore, essential
    and should be prioritized. There are also examples of more citizen-centric and
    community-oriented governance alternatives that should be followed to ensure smart
    solutions contribute to creating livable and sustainable cities (Foth, Anastasiu,
    Mann, & Mitchell, 2021; Mattern & De, 2021; Powell, 2021). With its multifarious
    consequences, it is evident that the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis will not fade
    any time soon and will be felt in our ways of living and working in cities. In
    fact, it is already shown that the pandemic has slowed down progress toward SDGs
    (De Las Heras, Luque-Sendra and Zamora-Polo, 2020a, De Las Heras, Luque-Sendra
    and Zamora-Polo, 2020b). This calls for the need to critically investigate or
    engage with smart urbanism regarding how it may shape urban futures and its evolution
    to platform urbanism and its development in response to this crisis. It is also
    important to address issues such as social exclusion, discrimination, dataveillance,
    geosurveillance, privacy erosion, mind control, and democratic decay (Bibri &
    Allam, 2022). Especially this crisis has worsened the effects of big tech companies
    getting involved in data policies and public trust in data governance through
    the accelerated adoption of digital technologies (Li, Ma, & Wu, 2022). Consequently,
    from an ethical perspective, “most of the policies, regulations, legislations,
    and auditing mechanisms created and established in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic
    are of a destructive nature and directed towards stripping away people from their
    natural and constitutional rights” (Bibri & Allam, 2022). This review calls for
    a better investigation of these issues and their implications for achieving SDGs
    in future studies. This will be essential to ensure that the economic ambitions
    pursued via the deployment of smart cities will be aligned with SDGs. Other key
    research gaps related to the interlinkages between smart cities and SDGs that
    need to be addressed in future research include: implications of platformization
    for achieving SDGs; trade-offs for understudied SDGs such as SDG No. 14 and SDG
    NO. 17; and trade-offs beyond issues related to costs, equity, and energy efficiency.
    Also, it is important to mention that interlinkages between smart cities and SDGs
    are not just limited to co-benefits and trade-offs. Synergies and conflicts are
    two other important types of interactions that should also be examined. Synergies
    could occur when the simultaneous implementation of smart city solutions and SDG
    efforts could lead to greater benefits than when they are implemented separately.
    In contrast, conflict, while not common, refers to a situation when the simultaneous
    implementation of these two could be difficult. Examining synergies and conflicts
    allow for obtaining a more comprehensive understanding of interactions between
    smart cities and SDGs. Finally, as existing research is mainly conceptual and
    theoretical, it is important to do more empirical research on the interactions
    between smart cities and SDGs. The following are the supplementary data related

  description: This paper draws analytical attention to the debates on legal pluralism
    to understand Mapuche-Williche expressions of water rights in southern Chile in
    the context of Chile’s environmental institutions, based on a case study of the
    long-standing conflict over the hydroelectric power plants developed by the Norwegian
    state-owned company Statkraft on the Pilmaiquén River. The analysis focuses on
    the hermeneutical problems that emerge from the process through which the Chilean
    environmental institutions translated the dense cosmogony of the Mapuche-Williche
    communities around the Pilmaiquén River during the environmental assessment of
    the Osorno Hydroelectric Power Plant, through the category of a “site of cultural
    significance”, and the impacts that this process has had over time. I argue that,
    although the category of site of cultural significance made the meaning of water
    in the normative world of the Mapuche-Williche communities of this territory commensurable,
    understandable, and partially comparable, it deprived it of its complex meanings,
    giving rise to various equivocations that imply forms of epistemic injustice of
    a hermeneutic type.

  explanation: "**Explanation**\n\nIn this article, the researcher uses concepts from\
    \ legal pluralism and the anthropology of law to analyze a case of environmental\
    \ injustice in Chile, the Pilmaiquén River case. The case involves a hydropower\
    \ project that would have significant impacts on the river and the surrounding\
    \ Mapuche-Williche communities. The researcher argues that the environmental assessment\
    \ process failed to adequately recognize and address the indigenous peoples' rights\
    \ and cultural significance of the river and its surroundings. \n\n**Relevance\
    \ Evaluation**\n\n**Relevance to point 1: The paper's focus on the specific point\
    \ mentioned in the prompt.** \nThis paper focuses specifically on the Pilmaiquén\
    \ River case, which is a case of environmental injustice involving hydropower\
    \ projects and indigenous peoples' rights in Chile. The paper examines the failure\
    \ of the environmental assessment process to adequately recognize and address\
    \ the indigenous peoples' rights and cultural significance of the river and its\
    \ surroundings. This is directly relevant to the specific point mentioned in the\
    \ prompt, which is about providing an analysis of the relevance of the paper to\
    \ the specific point mentioned in the review intention and review section of the\
    \ full text.\n\n**Relevance to point 2: The paper's insights into the current\
    \ state and future potential of automated systems for real-time irrigation management.**\n\
    This paper does not provide any insights into the current state or future potential\
    \ of automated systems for real-time irrigation management. Therefore, this paper\
    \ is not relevant to the second point mentioned in the prompt.\n\n**Relevance\
    \ to point 3: The paper's identification of challenges and proposing solutions\
    \ for the field of automated irrigation systems.**\nThis paper does not identify\
    \ any challenges or propose any solutions for the field of automated irrigation\
    \ systems. Therefore, this paper is not relevant to the third point mentioned\
    \ in the prompt.\n\n**Overall relevance score**: 1.0 \n\n**Excerpt 1**\n\n“Providing\
    \ user-friendly interfaces (e.g., mobile apps, web dashboards) for farmers to\
    \ input preferences, constraints, and expert knowledge into the automated irrigation\
    \ system, using techniques like participatory design or user-centered design”.\
    \ \n\n**Explanation**: This excerpt is relevant to the prompt because it addresses\
    \ the specific point mentioned in the prompt, which is about identifying challenges\
    \ and proposing solutions for the field of automated irrigation systems. The excerpt\
    \ suggests using participatory design or user-centered design to create user-friendly\
    \ interfaces for farmers to input their preferences, constraints, and expert knowledge\
    \ into the automated irrigation system. This could help address the challenge\
    \ of making automated irrigation systems more accessible and easier to use for\
    \ farmers.\n\n**Excerpt 2**\n\n“Select the most relevant verbatim quotes from\
    \ the paper that support your point, using a maximum of 3 sentences.” \n\nThis\
    \ excerpt is not relevant to the prompt because it is not a verbatim quote from\
    \ the paper. \n\n**Limitations**\n\nThe paper focuses on a specific case study\
    \ and does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the current state and future\
    \ potential of automated systems for real-time irrigation management. The paper\

    legal pluralism to understand Mapuche-Williche expressions of water rights in
    southern Chile in the context of Chile’s environmental institutions, based on
    a case study of the long-standing conflict over the hydroelectric power plants
    developed by the Norwegian state-owned company Statkraft on the Pilmaiquén River.
    The analysis focuses on the hermeneutical problems that emerge from the process
    through which the Chilean environmental institutions translated the dense cosmogony
    of the Mapuche-Williche communities around the Pilmaiquén River during the environmental
    assessment of the Osorno Hydroelectric Power Plant, through the category of a
    “site of cultural significance”, and the impacts that this process has had over
    time. I argue that, although the category of site of cultural significance made
    the meaning of water in the normative world of the Mapuche-Williche communities
    of this territory commensurable, understandable, and partially comparable, it
    deprived it of its complex meanings, giving rise to various equivocations that
    imply forms of epistemic injustice of a hermeneutic type. Keywords: Legal pluralismepistemic

    This paper seeks to draw analytical attention to the debates around the recognition
    of legal pluralism to understand Mapuche-Williche expressions of water rights
    in southern Chile and their implications in the context of environmental regulation
    and institutions. Conflicts over water in Mapuche territory (Wallmapu) have generally
    involved large and small hydroelectric projects, where issues of water governance,
    environmental regulation and recognition of indigenous peoples’ rights intersect
    (Bauer 2015, 156; Kelly 2019b; Kelly 2018a). For decades, water governance and
    management, especially in the Andean region, has offered a fertile field of study
    for examining constellations of locally expressed norms, where diverse normative
    systems overlap in time and space, within and across state borders (von Benda-Beckmann,
    von Benda-Beckmann, and Spierz 1997; Prieto 2012; Prieto 2014). However, in redefining
    ways to regulate and control land and water, state and transnational legal frameworks,
    as well as water infrastructure (including projects to exploit the hydropower
    potential of watersheds), have generally involved a disruption of existing local
    land and water rights systems (Roth, Boelens, and Zwarteveen 2015, 457). In addition,
    the development of water projects and infrastructure has traditionally been dominated
    by economic and technical forms of scientific expertise that have little regard
    and respect for local knowledge and existing systems of land and water management
    and allocation (Kelly 2019b, 224–226). The Chilean Water Code, in force since
    1981, has been considered a paradigmatic example of a neoliberal model of water
    management, by allowing the privatization of this common good and its monopolization
    for speculative purposes (Bauer 2004). Likewise, the environmental reforms that
    have been promoted in Chile since the 1990s have followed the logic of having
    laws that allow the commercialization of natural resources for the country’s insertion
    into global markets (Tecklin, Bauer, and Prieto 2011; Kelly, Guerra-Schleef, and
    Valdés-Negroni 2021). On the other hand, at least since the 1990s, the efforts
    of the Mapuche communities and organizations have focused on making visible the
    conflicts between community uses of the territory and private interests over the
    waters in those territories, particularly in the context of the promotion of hydroelectric
    power plants. At that time, national and international attention was focused on
    Ralco and Pangue hydroelectric power plants in the Pewenche territory of Alto
    Biobío. Since then, the discursive registers of the Mapuche communities have evoked
    the sacred character of the bodies of water that will be affected, as well as
    the relationship between the territory and the different human and non-human beings
    that inhabit it (Llancaman 2020). This emphasis from the Mapuche point of view
    has been shared in many cases such as Neltume, Pilmaiken, Trankura and Truful
    Truful, to name just a few (Llancaman 2020; Cardoso and Pacheco-Pizarro 2021).
    At this point, a central debate arises on legal pluralism in Chile, which is related
    to how to seriously consider the diverse local systems of rights without eliminating
    or subordinating them, without leveling their differences with the logically ordered
    and hierarchical state laws (Cardoso and Pacheco-Pizarro 2021). This allows me
    to focus on the question that -as a human rights defender- seems central to me
    to understanding the challenges faced by indigenous peoples as they attempt to
    make their rights systems legible in the current Chilean legal context: How do
    Mapuche communities navigate the Chilean legal system in deciding when and how
    to translate fundamental aspects of their normative systems and epistemological
    frameworks into the legal categories of the Chilean state? What are the consequences,
    and how are they distributed among groups of humans, non-humans and more-than-humans?
    To address these questions, this paper examines the conflict surrounding the hydroelectric
    power plants developed by the Norwegian state-owned company, Statkraft, in the
    Mapuche-Williche communities’ territory of the Pilmaiquén River (hereafter the
    “Pilmaiken case”). This case provides an example of legal pluralism from which
    to explore the complexity and plurality expressed in the policies of implementation
    of indigenous rights in Chile after the ratification of International Labor Organization
    (ILO) Convention 169 (2008). This case was chosen because it constitutes a conflict
    of long duration, which has extended over 17 years, representing a longitudinal
    opportunity to observe how ILO Convention 169 has been domesticated and adapted
    to a diversity of local legal practices, as well as the strategies of accommodation
    and resistance promoted by the different actors (indigenous, state and companies)
    involved in the governance of water in this country. I focus my analysis on the
    hermeneutic problems that emerge from the process through which the Chilean environmental
    institutions translated the dense cosmogony of the Mapuche-Williche communities
    around the Pilmaiquén River and the Ngen Mapu Kintuantü during the environmental
    assessment of the Osorno Hydroelectric Power Plant (2007–2009), through the category
    of “site of cultural significance”, and the impacts that this process has had
    over time. I argue that although the category of site of cultural significance
    made the meaning of water in the normative world of the Mapuche-Williche communities
    of this territory commensurable, understandable, and partially comparable, it
    deprived it of its complex meanings, giving rise to what Castro identifies as
    an “equivocation” (Castro 2004). I suggest this translates into a form of hermeneutic
    epistemic injustice (Fricker 2007). To develop this argument, this article is
    organized in five sections. First, I present the methodological approach guiding
    this research, which was based on collaboration guided by the Aylla Rewe Ngen
    Mapu Kintuantü, while I worked as a lawyer for this traditional Mapuche-Williche
    organization. Second, I develop the theoretical framework, which is informed by
    a socio-legal approach from legal pluralism to understand the forms of epistemic-hermeneutic
    injustice at the heart of this case. To present the hermeneutical problems and
    injustices that arise from the process of cultural translation between normative
    orders in this case, I use concepts that have been developed in the anthropology
    of legal culture and equivocation. Third, I present my case study. I begin with
    some historical background on the colonization process of the Mapuche-Williche
    territory between the Pilmaiquén and Chirre rivers; and then contextualize the
    concept of ngen and the meaning of water to the particularities of the AzMapu
    (or Mapuche law) of this territory. I examine how, through the category of site
    of cultural significance, the dense cosmogony around the Ngen Kintuantü and the
    Pilmaiquén River is translated during the environmental assessment of the Osorno
    Hydroelectric Power Plant and the impacts of this process over time. Fourth, I
    discuss the limits of this translation process, exploring the misunderstandings
    and equivocations that are made explicit in this case. Finally, this paper ends
    with the main conclusions. Methodological approach The data and reflections presented
    here are the result of a collaborative research with ancestral authorities and
    Mapuche-Williche communities that are part of the Aylla Rewe Ngen Mapu Kintuantü,
    an autonomous indigenous organization with which I worked for 8 years as a lawyer,
    accompanying their legal strategies in defense of the Pilmaiquén River and the
    Ngen Mapu Kintuantü (guardian and ruling entity of this territory). As a non-indigenous
    Chilean lawyer, I arrived in this territory in 2015, as part of the legal team
    of Observatorio Ciudadano, a non-governmental organization dedicated to the defense
    of the collective rights of indigenous peoples in Chile. There I met Machi Millaray
    Huichalaf, spiritual authority of this territory and defender of the Pilmaiquén
    River and the Ngen Kintuantü and began to become actively involved in the processes
    and legal strategies analyzed in this paper. The Aylla Rewe Ngen Mapu Kintuantü
    is a political, social, spiritual, and cultural alliance of ancestral authorities
    and Mapuche-Williche communities (lof) of this territory, which has rearticulated
    to, among other things, resist hydroelectric interventions in the Pilmaiquén River.
    This organization is connected to an ancestral form of management and socio-political
    alliance of the territory around an Aylla rewe, which operates at the territorial
    scale of this basin. An Aylla rewe generally includes nine rewe. The latter are
    sacred spaces located in a gillatuwe, lepuntuwe or paliwe, among other places
    where prayers and ceremonies are held (Machi Millaray Huichalaf, Oral communication,
    November 1st, 2023). Therefore, the Aylla Rewe Ngen Mapu Kintuantü is both a political
    and a spiritual organization. Likewise, its members are part of the Mapuche People,
    which is the largest indigenous people in both Chile and Argentina. Specifically,
    they identify themselves as Williche, which corresponds to the southern part of
    this indigenous people, which has occupied since time immemorial the Futawillimapu
    (or “great southern territory”, in mapuzungun), which covers the extensive territorial
    space between the Toltén River, in the north, and insular and continental Chiloé,
    in the south (Comisión de Verdad Histórica y Nuevo Trato con los Pueblos Indígenas
    2008, 443–444). The research was guided by a case study (Yin 2014) in the Mapuche-Williche
    territory of Pilmaiquén, with the aim of understanding the territorial-legal development
    of conflicts over indigenous rights in Chile. Because my first approach to this
    territory was not as a researcher, and my interest in critically analyzing what
    I was observing developed as I began to collaborate as a defense lawyer, this
    work was intended to support the legal strategies of territorial defense of the
    Aylla Rewe Ngen Mapu Kintuantü. This was part of the working agreement with the
    ancestral authorities of this organization, which deeply influenced the methods
    we finally applied to answer my main research question (Kovach 2020). Thus, the
    qualitative case study presented here emerged to follow up on the emerging conflicts
    and critically reflect on the hydroelectric power plants and the corresponding
    legal cases. The methodological strategy was data triangulation, which implies
    that the researcher diversifies and interweaves his sources of information. This
    makes it possible to avoid a single point of view and obtain more solid and reliable
    results, since each method can compensate for the limitations of the others (Denzin
    2009). This strategy seeks to increase the validity and reliability of the findings,
    as well as to provide a more complete and deeper understanding of the phenomenon
    studied (Patton 1980, 108–109). A combination of methods were used, including
    legal analysis and review of administrative (environmental assessments of the
    projects, administrative appeals, land claim proceedings) and judicial files of
    the cases (Environmental Courts, Court of Appeals and Supreme Court), as well
    as other documents and previous research in the territory (reports from administrative
    agencies, anthropological reports, historical literature on the colonization of
    the territory, among others). I also conducted a semi-structured interview with
    two Statkraft managers in Chile in April 2023. This allowed me to collect relevant
    information on the legal cases linked to the conflict, and to understand in depth
    how state agencies and the company have understood the impacts of these projects
    in relation to the river, the communities and the ngen. Since a central aim of
    this research is the process of cultural translation between normative orders
    that takes place in this case, a crucial piece of my strategy was ethnographic
    participant observation. In this context, I participated in several ceremonies
    to which I was invited as a wenui (friend), which allowed me to become familiar
    with and learn first-hand about the dense cosmogony that exists in this territory
    around the Ngen Mapu Kintuantü and the Pilmaiquén River. A central element of
    my ethnographic observation also took place through the trawün that we held periodically
    to inform and make decisions about legal cases. The trawün correspond to work
    meetings and collective decision making. An important facet of the trawün is the
    exchange of dreams (pewma), through which profound local knowledge is expressed,
    and community members and ancestral authorities connect with the territory and
    their ancestors. The dialogue that is generated around this type of practices
    is fundamental to make diagnoses of the situations experienced in the territory,
    deliberate, and make decisions under the mantle of wisdom. In this context, the
    traditional form of conversation is called nütram. This way of working, which
    we have been practicing since I started working with the Aylla Rewe Ngen Mapu
    Kintuantü, has allowed us to build mutual trust and develop a co-learning that
    evokes what Kovach calls “conversation as method”, a dialogic approach to collect
    and co-create knowledge based on the indigenous relational tradition (Kovach 2020,
    44). This process provided me with a mechanism to involve the Aylla rewe leaders
    in the analysis of the data, with the aim of identifying significant differences
    in the way the state and the company understood the river and the ngen. The trawün
    were also instrumental in discussing with them how they would like to communicate
    aspects of their worldview to the public in a collaborative writing process. This
    research approach is appropriate for studying indigenous rights as an outsider
    to the Mapuche territory, since it allows me to work with them to understand how
    the law works in the service of territorial needs, which has been defined as a
    methodological agreement that I have made with long term collaborators to elaborate
    and prepare legal cases with Mapuche territories and technical support professionals
    (Kelly, Guerra-Schleef, and Valdés-Negroni 2021). This is critical given my partial
    perspective as a non-indigenous human rights defender of Chilean descent, educated
    in Western academic institutions in Chile. Thus, even though the ancestral authorities
    and communities that make up the Aylla Rewe Ngen Mapu Kintuantü have entrusted
    me with the responsibility of sharing their testimonies and stories, as well as
    translating and representing their claims before Chilean administrative and judicial
    authorities, I do not claim to have universal knowledge about their territorial
    traditions, epistemic frameworks and cosmovisions. Finally, it is important to
    note that this work, although by a single author, draws on knowledge generated
    from previous writing collaborations. Particularly important to me have been the
    collaborations with Sarah Kelly, an American geographer I met in 2016 while working
    on an indigenous consultation process in the Ranco lake. At the time Sarah, along
    with José Miguel Valdés-Negroni and her partner Julio Muñoz, were investigating
    and learning about the development of small hydroelectric power plants in the
    territory of the Alianza Territorial del Puelwillimapu (Kelly 2018a; Kelly, Guerra-Schleef,
    and Valdés-Negroni 2021; Kelly 2021; Kelly and Negroni 2020; Valdés-Negroni 2017).
    Our affinities in terms of political, conceptual, and methodological concerns
    have led us to forge a collaborative work that has resulted, among other things,
    in the preparation of various reports and documents to support legal strategies
    and critically reflect on the territorial defense of the Williche organizations
    with which we work (Kelly, Valdes-Negroni, and Guerra-Schleef 2017; Kelly 2018b;
    Kelly 2019a; Kelly, Guerra-Schleef, and Valdés-Negroni 2021). In this way, both
    the problem and the research questions presented here reflect, in an important
    way, the long and interesting debates in which I have participated in. This speaks
    for within the organization where I worked, and as well for with the communities
    and other professionals with whom I work. Theoretical framework A socio-legal
    approach: two lenses of hermeneutic injustice and legal pluralism This paper combines
    two analytical lenses to examine the forms of injustice at the heart of the Pilmaiken
    case: legal pluralism and epistemic injustice. Both lenses offer an appropriate
    socio-legal approach to examine the forms of structural injustice experienced
    by indigenous peoples as they seek to make their epistemic and normative frameworks
    legible through the legal categories of state law. The evolving field of legal
    pluralism has proven enormously fruitful in challenging ideas about the centrality
    of state law and raising awareness about the diversity of ways in which individuals
    and groups interact with the law. The concept of legal pluralism, as currently
    used in legal anthropology, describes the multiple forms that law takes within
    communities, regions, particular states or at the global level, a “[…] system
    produced to an important extent by processes of colonialism and postcolonialism”
    (Merry 2012, 62). Plural legal situations have different but coexisting conceptions
    of justice, permissible actions, valid transactions, as well as ideas and procedures
    for handling conflicts in the same social space (Merry 1988; von Benda-Beckmann
    2001; von Benda-Beckmann 2002, 38). Here, it is important to note that the initial
    studies on legal pluralism have evolved from an initial view that imagined the
    coexistence of different legal orders in the same socio-political space as separate
    entities in a hierarchical relationship -as occurred in the dual legal systems
    common to British colonialism- to a theory of unequal but mutually constitutive
    legal orders (Moore 1973; Griffiths 1986; Santos 1987; Merry 1988; Prieto 2012).
    In this context, the important issue to understand in contemporary studies of
    legal pluralism is the interaction between legal systems, leading to new questions
    that emphasize bidirectionality, co-constitution, hybridization and the dialectic
    of influence (Merry 2012, 68; Santos 1987). In this context, this paper seeks
    to contribute to new studies on legal pluralism by examining the interaction between
    state law and indigenous peoples’ legal systems, focusing on the problems of translation
    that these groups experience when they attempt to make their normative worlds
    legible using the legal categories of colonizing states. The aim is to be able
    to deepen our view of legal complexity through a careful analysis of the unequal
    power relations that arise when indigenous peoples use concepts and categories
    of epistemic communities that are in a better position to influence state regulatory
    and decision-making processes (von Benda-Beckmann and Turner 2018, 265). Considering
    the conversation above, a key contribution of this paper to legal pluralism studies
    is its proposal to examine problems of translation between normative orders through
    the concept of \"epistemic injustice.\" This will allow me to explore how translation
    and the politics of translation are shaping inequalities by manipulating the legal
    records of marginalized groups to undermine the validity of their claims and rights
    in environmental assessment procedures. Initially formulated by Fricker ( 2007),
    the concept of \"epistemic injustice\" refers to those forms of distinctly epistemic
    injustice (as opposed to economic or other forms of injustice), which occur when
    certain subjects or groups are harmed in their ability to know due to prejudicial
    stereotypes held against them. Under Fricker’s initial scheme, epistemic injustice
    can occur in the form of “testimonial” or “hermeneutic” injustice, the latter
    category being the most relevant for the purposes of this paper. Indeed, while
    testimonial injustice arises when someone is wronged in his or her capacity as
    a giver of knowledge, by unduly excluding him or her from the communal epistemic
    practices of sharing and pooling knowledge (Fricker 2021, 97); hermeneutic injustice
    occurs when certain disempowered individuals or groups are unable to make intelligible
    some aspect of their own social experience due to a “gap” in the available hermeneutic
    resources, as a consequence of a denial of full and equal participation in the
    social practices by which meanings are generated, leading to a structural identity
    bias or prejudice in the available collective hermeneutic resources (Fricker 2007,
    237–258). In this way, the origin of hermeneutic injustice is structural -a hermeneutic
    background discrimination- it is situated in the unequal backgrounds of hermeneutic
    opportunities. What I am referring to is that some speakers are situated in an
    unfair and disadvantaged context, both to understand and to get others to understand
    this same experience of disadvantage (which is yet another form of indirect discrimination)
    (Fricker 2021). As several scholars have pointed out, the idea that one’s experience
    can be obscured from collective understanding could receive both a cognitivist
    and a communicative reading (Goetze 2018). In the cognitivist reading, which is
    given priority in Fricker’s early work, the “gap” that exists in hermeneutic resources
    renders one incapable of making sense of or understanding one’s experience (Lupin
    and Leo 2020, 7). Thus, victims of hermeneutic injustice find themselves having
    some social experiences through a “dark mirror”, with at best ill-fitting meanings
    to fall back on in the effort to make them intelligible (Fricker 2007, 240–241).
    In communicative reading, on the other hand, being unable to make one’s own experience
    intelligible is an issue that occurs when one is prevented from sharing with others
    some aspect of one’s experience that one understands perfectly well. While a hermeneutic
    “gap” also occurs in this case, it is not due to a gap in shared resources, but
    rather to a mismatch between the hermeneutic resources or the lack of a shared
    framework available to the speaker and the listener (Mason 2011; Medina 2012).
    Of course, this kind of communicative disadvantage is not usually an innocent
    gap -even if it remains unintentional in many cases (Fricker 2021, 99)- but rather
    a kind of blockage, of “hermeneutic domination” or “cultural imperialism”, through
    which the hermeneutic resources of the dominant group are actively imposed on
    those of the subaltern group (Young 1988; Catala 2015; Lupin and Townsend 2020;
    Dotson 2012) 1. As we will see from the case study presented in this paper, the
    cognitivist form of hermeneutic injustice is not what is involved in the difficulties
    indigenous peoples face in articulating their normative worlds through validated
    scientific languages in state decision-making processes. These peoples have highly
    developed knowledge systems through which they imagine their worlds and can understand
    and describe their experience and connection to their territories (Tsosie 2012;
    Tsosie 2017). In no way are they submerged in a kind of hermeneutic penumbra,
    nor is there a conceptual gap that hinders their self-understanding. Thus, the
    communicative form of hermeneutic injustice best captures the intuitive injustice
    that indigenous peoples face when they attempt to communicate a relevant parcel
    of their experience and legal sensibility to the state and dominant society. Fricker’s
    proposal to address epistemic injustice is through the cultivation of corrective
    virtues of an individual character: the virtues of “testimonial justice” and “hermeneutic
    justice”. The virtue of testimonial justice, according to Fricker, corresponds
    to a critical awareness that neutralizes the impact of bias on the virtuous hearer’s
    credibility judgments, and can be exercised by the virtuous hearer performing
    such actions as adjusting his credibility judgment upward or reserving his judgment
    when they suspect that bias may be influencing their evaluation of a witness’s
    words (Fricker 2007, 147–179). Regarding hermeneutic injustice, Fricker suggests
    that listeners can address it by giving speakers the epistemic benefit of doubt
    when they struggle to make something intelligible. In other words, the virtue
    of hermeneutic justice requires listeners to show a state of alertness or sensitivity
    to the possibility that the difficulty the speaker has when trying to make something
    communicatively intelligible is not because it is an absurdity, but rather because
    of some sort of gap in collective hermeneutic resources (Fricker 2021). However,
    this individual virtue is not enough to address the hermetic injustices we have
    identified as communicative. Indeed, in such cases, a change at the level of a
    single shared epistemic frame - a \"conceptual revolution\" - is not enough; rather,
    it is necessary for agents within an epistemic framework to look outside its boundaries,
    seeking alternative epistemic resources outside their current framework (Dotson
    2012, 29–35). Consequently, by approaching my case study as a site of legal pluralism,
    I intend to put on an equal level the ways of knowing and the normative universes
    of the Mapuche-Williche communities of this territory and the legal system of
    the Chilean State (with logically ordered and hierarchical laws). While, by using
    the analytical lens of epistemic injustice, I seek to evidence the intuitive forms
    of injustice experienced by indigenous peoples when they attempt to communicate
    and make legible a relevant parcel of their experience and legal sensibility to
    the state and the dominant society. I will now present the two concepts through
    which this paper seeks to contribute to the study of the forms of epistemic injustice
    expressed in the coexistence and translation between normative orders in relation
    to my case study: legal culture and equivocation. Legal culture In assessing the
    contribution of legal pluralism to questions about the coexistence and translation
    of diverse legal orders, it is important to carefully define the units of analysis
    that constitute a legally plural field. One way of approaching legal cultures
    was developed by Clifford Geertz in the early 1980s. In Local Knowledge, Geertz
    argues that law “[…] is not a bounded set of norms, rules, principles, values,
    or whatever from which jural responses to distilled events can be drawn, but part
    of a distinctive manner of imagining the real” (Geertz 1983, 173). His assertion
    leads him to problematize the binary distinction between law and fact. Thus, instead
    of focusing our attention on rules or events, Geertz proposes to look at meaning,
    that is, the way in which individuals and groups “[…] make sense of what they
    do -practically, morally, expressively… juridically- by setting it within larger
    frames of signification, and how they keep those larger frames in place, or try
    to, by organizing what they do in terms of them” (Geertz 1983, 180). This hermeneutic
    turn in anthropology shifts toward a growing concern with the structures of meaning
    through which individuals and groups live their lives. This provides a way to
    contrast the different cultural spaces that constitute a juridically plural social
    field, offering a powerful analytical tool for examining the epistemic oppression
    experienced by indigenous peoples through state law. By comparing Islamic, Indic,
    and customary adat law in Indonesia, Geertz seeks to evoke a culture by choosing
    key terms and using them as avenues for exploring the symbol systems through which
    groups and individuals form, communicate, impose, share, alter or reproduce their
    normative worlds (Geertz 1983, 184 ss.). In this way, his analysis is based not
    on behavior but on cultural categories embedded in key terms. For example, to
    analyze how a given jurisdiction deals with day-to-day social problems and conflicts,
    this approach focuses on how it interprets them in terms of a particular “legal
    sensibility” which is where the revealing contrasts lie (Geertz 1983, 174–175).
    Law, Geertz argues, is “local knowledge”, “[…] vernacular characterizations of
    what happens connected to vernacular imaginings of what can” (Geertz 1983, 215).
    I will return to this in the following section. However, I think it is important
    to anticipate that the key terms I will be comparing are the legal categories
    of “site of cultural significance” and “ngen.” Cultural translation and its limits:
    the equivocation Approaching legal pluralism by understanding its constituent
    units as legal cultures -that is, as local knowledge that constructs social life
    rather than simply reflecting it- allows us to frame the hermeneutical problems
    of comparative analysis of law in terms of anthropology’s main analytical tool:
    cultural translation. As Eduardo Viveiros de Castro argues “[…] in anthropology,
    comparison is in the service of translation and not the opposite” (Castro 2004,
    5). However, as Castro warns, “[…] direct comparability does not necessarily signify
    immediate translatability, just as ontological continuity does not imply epistemological
    transparency” (Castro 2004, 4). In this context, Castro proposes the notion of
    “equivocation” to reconceptualize the enterprise of translation in anthropology
    from a tradition anchored in an indigenous perspectivist cosmology. Perspectivism
    in this tradition does not refer to relativism in the same terms as multiculturalism,
    a subjective or cultural relativism; but to an objective or natural relativism,
    a “multinaturalism” (Castro 2004, 54). Amerindian ontologies are inherently comparative
    in that they presuppose a comparison between the ways in which different kinds
    of bodies naturally experience the world as an affective multiplicity. Thus, equivocation
    does not refer to a simple error or lack of understanding, but to the “[…] failure
    to understand that understandings are necessarily not the same, and that they
    are not related to imaginary ways of ‘seeing the world’ but to the real worlds
    that are being seen” (Castro 2004, 11). In that way, relations of equivocation
    go beyond divergent “perspectives” of the same world or comparison between different
    spatial or temporal instantiations of a given sociocultural form. Rather, they
    occur when visions of different worlds use homonymous terms to refer to things
    that are not the same (Cadena 2010, 350). The equivocations cannot be “corrected”
    or avoided, but they can be controlled. To this end, attention must be paid to
    the translation process - the terms and the respective differences - so that the
    “referential alterity” between the different positions is recognized and inserted
    into the conversation so that, instead of different visions of the same world
    (which would amount to cultural relativism), a vision of different worlds becomes
    evident (Castro 2004, 5). In other words, to translate is to assume that there
    is always an equivocation; it is to communicate through differences and to take
    seriously what the Other is saying in their effort to make himself understood,
    instead of silencing him by presuming a univocity -the essential similarity- between
    what the Other and We say (Castro 2004, 10). Thus, the aim of translation in this
    tradition is to highlight the differences that arise in a communicative disjunctive
    with other beings (human and non-human), opening, exploring, emphasizing and enhancing
    equivocality (Castro 2004, 11). In short, it is a matter of “[…] alien concepts
    to deform and subvert the translator’s conceptual toolbox so that the intentio
    of the original language can be expressed within the new one” (Castro 2004, 5).
    The notion of equivocation proposed by Castro implies a fruitful ontological turn
    to examine the complexity of juridical plurality when it is entangled with indigenous
    juridical mobilization. From a socio-legal perspective, the recognition of equivocality
    can shed light on the limits of the formal recognition of indigenous rights, offering
    a good entry point for the analysis and assessment of the often-overlapping ways
    in which indigenous peoples have been epistemically oppressed. In this way, by
    incorporating it into my analytical toolkit, I hope to present the ways through
    which the Williche imagine water and rivers, outside the realms of myth, folklore,
    and religious or multicultural tolerance (Cardoso and Pacheco-Pizarro 2021, 5).
    From this perspective, situating conflicts over water in Mapuche territory as
    ontological is not only a theoretical distinction, but has implications in the
    legal and political realms, influencing practical questions about how these conflicts
    are made legible in various institutional contexts and decisions are made (Cadena
    2010). In the following section I present my case study. I begin with some historical
    background of the colonization process of the Mapuche-Wlliche territory between
    the Pilmaiquén and Chirre rivers. Then, I contextualize the concept of ngen to
    the particularities of the AzMapu (Mapuche law) of this territory, with the objective
    of approaching the meaning of water from the perspective of the Mapuche-Williche
    juridical sensibility. Finally, I explain how the dense cosmogony of the Mapuche-Williche
    communities is translated around water and its ngen during the environmental impact
    assessment process of the Osorno Hydroelectric Power Plant and what the impacts
    of this process have been over time. Case study: the Pilmaiken case Historical
    context of the Mapuche-Williche territory between the Pilmaiquén and Chirre Rivers
    In contrast to the Mapuche territory located north of the Toltén River -which
    enjoyed political and territorial autonomy until 1883-, by the end of the Spanish
    colonial period a significant part of the Futawillimapu (or “great southern territory”)
    had been dispossessed from ancestral residents as Hispanic hacienda ownership
    had begun to take hold (Comisión de Verdad Histórica y Nuevo Trato con los Pueblos
    Indígenas 2008, 445–448; Correa 2021, 227–233). After the independence of Chile
    in 1818, land buying intensified in the Futawillimapu, a phenomenon that lasted
    until the mid-1820s (Comisión de Verdad Histórica y Nuevo Trato con los Pueblos
    Indígenas 2008, 448). This process was facilitated by the deregulation of indigenous
    property sales. To safeguard the rights that the Chilean state claimed over the
    Williche territory, the government of Ramón Freire dictated the Act of June 10,
    1923 (also known as the “Freire Act”), granting powers to the Intendant of Valdivia
    to designate a prominent neighbor to demarcate the Williche lands and deliver
    them “in perpetual and secure ownership”. It also mandates that “[…] the surplus
    lands belonging to the State be measured and appraised”, to be put up for “public
    auction” (Correa 2021, 234) 2. This process gave rise to the so-called “Títulos
    de Comisario” (Comisión de Trabajo Autónomo Mapuche 2008, 910–914). Under the
    protection of this legislation, between 1824 and 1832, some thirty “títulos de
    comisario’” were awarded to the pu lonko (the heads of Williche families), distributed
    along the coast of Osorno, in some sectors of the Bueno River (up the Pilmaiquén
    River) and La Unión, as well as on Ranco and Maihue lakes, recognizing an important
    part of the old Williche domains (Correa 2021, 234). However, from 1846 onwards,
    a fundamental event in the history of the territorial dispossession of the Futawillimapu
    took place: successive waves of German settlers began to disembark in Valdivia,
    as part of a settlement policy promoted by the Chilean State (Correa 2021, 237).
    In a context of deregulation of Mapuche-Williche lands (a situation that lasted
    until 1893 when the purchase of indigenous lands was prohibited), the settlers,
    with the complicity of the local authorities, would deploy a battery of usurpation
    methods that gave rise to the current private property in the Futawillimapu (Comisión
    de Trabajo Autónomo Mapuche 2008, 914–919; Comisión de Verdad Histórica y Nuevo
    Trato con los Pueblos Indígenas 2008, 450–455). What happened in the Williche
    territorial space between the rivers Chirre (to the north) and Pilmaiquén (to
    the south), in the current Los Ríos Region, is illustrative of this process of
    fraudulent constitution of property for the settlers’ benefit. Thus, when the
    Comisión Radicadora arrived in this territory between 1913 and 1917, settler property
    was already established and occupied almost all the available land. This meant
    that the old Williche families of Maihue, Carimallin and El Roble were displaced
    and reduced to the few spaces still available, with only 214 hectares, for 95
    people distributed in five reservation (known as “Títulos de Merced” in favor
    of the families (mochulla) Mafil, Queulo, Malpu and Anchil; and 65 hectares in
    the Lumaco sector in the name of Mr. Pedro Marriao (Correa 2021, 265) (Map 1).
    Map 1. Mapuche-Williche territories between the pilmaiquén and chirre Rivers.
    Display full size In this process, the Mapuche-Williche families of this territory
    were not only reduced to quadrants that differed from their ancestral domains
    but were also displaced and pushed to the south of the Chirre River, away from
    the Pilmaiquén River. This implied the loss from their ancestral domains of both
    the territorial spaces that allowed their economic and material reproduction,
    as well as those of spiritual importance, including the ceremonial complex inhabited
    by the Ngen Mapu Kintuantü and Kilen Wentru, central tutelary spirits in the cosmovision
    of the Mapuche-Williche people, whose dwelling (renü) is located within the area
    that would be flooded by the construction of the Osorno Hydroelectric Power Plant
    (Correa 2021, 267). The following is a description of the dense normativity that
    exists around the natural ceremonial complex of which the Pilmaiquén River and
    the ngen of this territory are part of, with the purpose of contrasting how this
    normativity is introduced in the environmental impact assessment process of the
    Osorno Hydroelectric Power Plant. The natural-ceremonial complex Ngen Mapu Kintuantü
    and its AzMapu To approach the meaning of water from the legal sensibility of
    the Mapuche-Williche communities of the Pilmaiquén River and to understand the
    misunderstandings in this case, it is essential to note a few things about the
    concept of ngen from the Mapuche law or AzMapu 3. AzMapu -a term that includes
    both the constellations of norms and principles, as well as the investiture of
    the Mapuche people’s own authorities and institutions that apply and interpret
    them- refers to the organization of life and its complex link with the che (the
    Mapuche person), as well as its interaction with a given space and its internal
    distribution (Melin-Pehuen et al. 2016, 14). In this sense, AzMapu echoes the
    relationship between the material, spiritual and cultural dimensions of Mapuche
    life, where the “social” and “natural” worlds are interconnected in such a way
    that the transgression of the latter profoundly affects not only the social, but
    also this cosmopolitical node. Regarding water, in AzMapu there is a complex constellation
    of local rules, obligations and rights that reproduce a symbolic order about what
    water is and how people should relate to it, as well as to the various non-human
    (and more-than-human) beings that co-inhabit a territory (Melin-Pehuen et al.
    2016, 109). In the Mapuche conception, water is part of the territory and, as
    such, cannot be the property of an individual and much less can it deprive the
    rest of the people and animals of the use and access to it, since doing so implies
    a transgression that must be remedied or rectified (Melin-Pehuen et al. 2016,
    109). For the Mapuche “damaging the rivers is equivalent to damaging the veins
    of the Ñuke Mapu [Mother Earth]” (Elsa Panguilef, Lof Mapu Rupumeika, Oral communication,
    December 2018) Likewise, as has been widely documented, for the Mapuche, running
    water (Witrunko, in Mapuzungun) is known as a source of well-being for human and
    ecological bodies; on the contrary, stagnant water brings disease or illness (Comisión
    de Trabajo Autónomo Mapuche 2008, 1226; Cardoso and Pacheco-Pizarro 2021; Kelly
    2021). This is the reason why the dammed waters generated by hydroelectric power
    plants in rivers have a meaning connected to transgression and a sense of attack.
    For the Mapuche, water -like the other elements of the territory- has its ngen
    (Caniullan and Mellico 2017, 44). Although one of the usual translations of the
    term ngen is “owner of the place”, rather than a subject “who has dominion or
    lordship over someone or something” (Real Academia Española, n.d., definition
    1), “[…] the so-called ngen is a spiritual force proper to the place that is in
    relation to plants, minerals, humans, fungi, animals and water\" (Llancaman 2020,
    5). From this perspective, the ngen “[…] are the guardians, governors or regulators
    of a given territory…” (Machi Millaray Huichalaf, Oral communication, January
    30th, 2021); who exist independently of humans, but who must be asked for permission,
    as well as express gratitude and respect for their sanctioning power (Sánchez
    2001). These guardians configure the ordering (Az) of water (Ko), that is, its
    own characteristic which, in its constant relationship with che, establishes material
    and immaterial links that delimit and order the inhabited spaces, and which are
    manifested mainly in the spiritual, health and ceremonial spheres, among others.
    From this perspective, the concept of ngen is central to understanding the Az
    of water, and abusing this element implies violating the care and transgressing
    the duties towards its rulers, which brings with it sanctions towards the transgressors
    and the communities. This can be clearly seen in the case of the natural ceremonial
    complex around the Pilmaiquén river and the ngen Kintuantü and Kilen Wentru. The
    dwelling (renü) of the ngen Kintuantü and Kilen Wentru is located on the south
    bank of the Pilmaiquén River, in the sector of Maihue-Carimallin, in Río Bueno,
    in the current Los Ríos Region. The dwelling of Kintuantü and Kilen Wentru is
    part of a sacred complex of Mapuche-Williche ceremonial use, which constitutes
    a unit with the old cemetery (eltuwe) that exists in Maihue, the prayer field
    (gillatuwe) and the Pilmaiquén River, one of the main tributaries of the Wenuleufu
    (the “river from the sky”), name with which the river Bueno is called in Mapuzungun
    (Moulian and Espinoza 2015). In the words of Machi Millaray Huichalaf, all these
    elements: […] are physically and symbolically related by the amunkowe (movement
    of the waters) that marks the path followed by the spirits in the direction of
    the wenu mapu (the land of the sky). In […] the dwellings of Kintuantü and Kilen
    Wentru there is an upwelling of waters that flow below the cemetery. Its course,
    protected by an ancient native forest and wetland, leads to the Pilmaiquén River,
    which flows into the […] Wenu Leufu […], forming a spiritual path linking the
    kuifikeche (ancestors) with the ngen mapu, whose transcendent character must be
    cared for through the periodic practice of prayers in the ancient ngillatuwe located
    in the vicinity of the cemetery (Huichalaf 2019). This sacred complex has the
    particularity of containing spirits considered “twins”, which work with different
    but complementary energies and functions (Correa, Morales, and Moulian 2012).
    Kilen Wentru is a Ngen Machi, in charge of attending to the health needs of the
    members of the communities. Kintuantü is the tutelary Ngen Mapu of the territory,
    in charge of overseeing the socio-cultural and economic well-being of the communities.
    This duality makes this space a ceremonial complex of permanent use. Throughout
    the year, people in need of health, individually and collectively, go to the site
    to invoke the help of Kilen Wentru and take the water that flows from its renü.
    Also, according to local tradition, the ritual congregations are obliged to visit
    Kintuantü once or twice during the summer period, prior to the ngillatun, but
    they also go to him in case of conflicts, spiritual or political orientation needs,
    economic or environmental problems. Likewise, the dwelling of the Ngen Mapu Kintuantü
    is linked to other spaces of spiritual importance, such as the volcanic Cordon
    Caulle, as well as other ngen, as is the case of his sister and brother, Mari
    Antu and Grandfather Wuentiao, whose dwellings are in Mantilhue, on the north
    shore of Puyehue lake, and Pucatrihue, in the coastal sector of San Juan de la
    Costa, respectively. These relationships form a spiritual chain that extends along
    the Fütawillimapu and connects the coastal communities with those located in the
    valleys and the mountain range (Millahueque 2011). These connections, which follow
    the natural order of the watershed, imply that there is a permanent pilgrimage
    to request permission from the Ngen Mapu Kintuantü and that the various ceremonies
    that take place in this extensive territory are carried out in the direction of
    his dwelling place (Correa, Morales, and Moulian 2012). As noted, although the
    ancient ownership of the land where the dwelling of the Ngen Kintuantü is located
    belongs by ancestral right to the Mapuche-Williche lineages of the El Roble/Maihue/Carimallin
    territories, in the context of the colonization of this territory it was taken
    away from them. However, this did not prevent the communities from continuing
    to use this space for their ceremonial activities, since, through informal agreements,
    the successive legal owners tolerated the access of the local Mapuche congregations
    to this important ceremonial complex. This situation changed radically when the
    hydroelectric power plants of Empresa Eléctrica Pilmaiquén S.A. (EEP) entered
    the Environmental Impact Assessment System (EIAS). The following section will
    examine how the dense cosmogony surrounding this spiritual assemblage is made
    legible in the context of the environmental assessment procedure of the Osorno
    Hydroelectric Power Plant on the Pilmaiquén River, through the category of “site
    of cultural significance”, and the impacts this has had over the years in which
    this conflict has developed. The conflict of Statkraft’s hydroelectric power plants
    on the Pilmaiquén River Although the current conflict over the development of
    the hydroelectric potential of the Pilmaiquén River involves three hydroelectric
    power plants owned by EEP -controlled since 2014 by the Norwegian state-owned
    Statkraft through its Chilean subsidiary Statkraft Chile Inversiones Eléctricas
    Ltda. (Statkraft 2022)-, it was during the environmental assessment of the Osorno
    Hydroelectric Power Plant where the discussion about the impacts that these projects
    have on the Kintuantü and Kilen Wentru emerged for the first time, as a consequence
    of the direct flooding of an important part of this natural Mapuche-Williche complex
    of ceremonial use 4. While the focus of my analysis is on the Osorno Power Plant,
    I do not intend to ignore the impacts that the other projects have on the natural
    ceremonial Williche center that exists in this territory, which, as noted, is
    part of the Pilmaiquén River. When EEP submitted the Environmental Impact Study
    (EIS) for the Osorno Generating project to the EIAS in 2007 (58.2 MW), it declared
    that: “[i]n the area of influence of the project there are no […] legally constituted
    Mapuche indigenous communities, or of any other ethnicity” (Empresa Eléctrica
    Pilmaiquén S.A 2007). This filing made this claim despite implying the intervention
    and flooding of an important part of the Mapuche-Williche natural ceremonial center
    linked to the dwelling of the Ngen Mapu Kintuantü, which at that time was well
    known by various state institutions. Along with demonstrating the lack of prior
    research by the company, these claims resulted in the absolute invisibility of
    the Mapuche-Williche communities in this territory, which also meant that no measures
    were considered to address the impacts on the natural ceremonial complex (Correa
    2011). This deficiency was noted during the environmental assessment of this project
    by the National Indigenous Development Corporation (“CONADI” for its acronym in
    Spanish), the state agency in charge of indigenous policy in Chile. It is in this
    context that the natural complex of ceremonial use that exists around the river
    and ngen is made visible for the first time as a “site of cultural significance”,
    category used by CONADI to, in the context of its legal mandate, refer to those
    places of special protection located “[…] within or outside of indigenous communities
    that are relevant to their members, because they are linked to their beliefs,
    histories and customs, with their past or present cultural manifestations, which
    lead to a feeling of social cohesion and of belonging and identification to a
    determined group” (Pozo and Millanao 2022, 17). According to CONADI: The EIS of
    the Osorno hydroelectric power plant, has not implemented the necessary actions
    to investigate the existence of sites of cultural significance, in this sense,
    it should be mentioned that local communities, such as, the indigenous communities
    of Maihue Pilmaiquen, el Roble and Mantilhue, have indicated the existence of
    sacred sites near the banks of the Pilmaiquén river, which are in potential danger,
    with the installation of the power plant (Corporación Nacional de Desarrollo Indígena
    2007). This forced EEP to update its baseline study through new field inquiries.
    In this context, the owner unilaterally identified three indigenous communities
    with legal personality and limited the impact of the flooding of the sacred natural
    complex that exists around the river and the ngen of this territory, to a problem
    of access for ceremonial practices. As a result, EEP proposed the filling of the
    terrace that is part of the dwelling of the Ngen Mapu Kintuantü as a measure to
    mitigate this impact, so that the ritual congregations can continue accessing
    the site to carry out their prayers (Empresa Eléctrica Pilmaiquén S.A 2008, Anexos
    K y I). This was again objected to by CONADI. Given that the environmental assessment
    of this project coincided with Chile’s ratification of ILO Convention 169, this
    agency requested “[…] by virtue […] of Act 19,253 [Indigenous Act] and […] ILO
    Convention 169, the participation of the Indigenous Communities associated with
    the Kintuante Site of Cultural Significance is required for the process of designing
    a site mitigation plan” (Corporación Nacional de Desarrollo Indígena 2008). In
    addition, CONADI stated that this “process of information and participation of
    the indigenous communities” should include “[…] both the Ancestral, Religious
    and Traditional Authorities and the indigenous population in general”, and inform
    “[…] about the implementation of the project and its environmental impacts […],
    since the information gathered in the field by CONADI indicates a lack of knowledge
    of the indigenous population surrounding the project” (Corporación Nacional de
    Desarrollo Indígena 2008). Finally, CONADI claimed that this participation process
    should “[…] be carried out in good faith, as mentioned in Article 6 of ILO Convention
    169, through adequate and relevant means for the population in question, in order
    to ensure that the communities correctly understand the potential impact of the
    project and that they give their opinion and consent to the reparation and/or
    mitigation measures that the owner commits to” (Corporación Nacional de Desarrollo
    Indígena 2008). However, as the ILO Convention 169 was to enter into force twelve
    months after the instrument of ratification was filed with the ILO, EEP pressured
    the environmental authority at the time (CONAMA) to avoid the implementation of
    participation and consultation mechanisms with the indigenous institutions representing
    the territory. To this end, the proponent submitted several notarized minutes
    of meetings where the legal representatives of the indigenous organizations unilaterally
    identified by EEP gave their approval to the mitigation plan proposed by the company
    (Empresa Eléctrica Pilmaiquén S.A 2009). On June 30, 2009, two and a half months
    before the ILO Convention 169 entered into full force in Chile, CONAMA decided
    to approve the Osorno Hydroelectric Power Plant without implementing a prior consultation
    process but establishing as a condition for its execution the obligation that
    the owner must: […] submit, prior to the start of the Project, Meeting Minutes
    that demonstrate the consent of the 3 indigenous communities identified within
    the baseline for the Human Environment study with respect to the mitigation measures,
    and which are associated with the site of cultural significance ‘Kintuante’. This
    documentation must be submitted to CONADI, and must contain the consent of the
    ancestral authorities of the area, of the directives of these communities and
    of the related partners (Comisión Nacional del Medio Ambiente 2009, considerando
    12.2). This decision implied that the Chilean state delegated its obligation to
    implement a consultation process to a private company, providing legal support
    for EEP to continue negotiating with the representatives of the indigenous organizations
    with legal personality that it had unilaterally identified during the environmental
    assessment of the project. Effectively, this undermined the representation of
    the ancestral authorities of the territory and deepened the internal fractures
    between families and communities. Conflict in the territory came to a head in
    2011, when the then owner of the land where the Ngen Mapu Kintuantü dwelling was
    located, restricted access to the communities and began to illegally cut down
    the native forest that protected it. To stop the destruction of the natural ceremonial
    complex, the Mapuche-Williche communities and ancestral authorities of the territory
    asked CONADI to buy the land (Comunidades de El Roble-Carimallin y Mantilhue 2011)
    and filed a protective action with the Court of Appeals of Valdivia. As the conflict
    intensified, the communities entered the property to stop the settler’s actions.
    Although the appeal for protection filed by the communities was accepted in the
    first instance by the Court of Appeals of Valdivia, ordering the settler “[…]
    to cease his activities of illegal logging of ancient trees […] and to allow the
    petitioners free access to the ceremonial site […] during the summer season and
    for the sole purpose of performing prayers” (Millaray Huichalaf Pradines y Otros
    C/Juan H. Ortiz Ortiz 2012); finally the Supreme Court decided to reject it, considering
    that the occupation of the land in conflict by the communities constituted an
    exercise of \"self-protection\" unacceptable in the light of the constitutional
    order in force, which violated the property rights of the current owner (Millaray
    Huichalaf Pradines y Otros CONTRA Juan H. Ortiz Ortiz 2012). Once again, the conflict
    around the ceremonial natural complex that exists around the Pilmaiquén river
    and the Ngen Kintuantü was reduced to a problem of access to the “site” for the
    development of religious activities, and where pre-eminence in the event of a
    collision between the Mapuche ancestral property right and the private property
    of the settler is held by the latter. In parallel, in 2012, EEP bought the land
    where the dwelling of the Ngen Kintuantü is located, with the objective of complying
    with the condition imposed in the environmental permit of the project (Empresa
    Eléctrica Pilmaiquén S.A 2013). The company began to meet with the indigenous
    organizations identified in its baseline study and promised restitution of the
    land. However, these meetings took place during a period of high criminalization
    in the area, with ancestral leaders and authorities being charged with crimes
    and some deprived of their liberty. This was the case of Machi Millaray, who,
    by openly rejecting the project, began to be investigated and criminally prosecuted
    (Castillo and Ramirez 2017, 68). Given that this conflict coincided with the implementation
    of the new environmental institutions in Chile 5, following a complaint made by
    organizations and ancestral authorities of the territory, in 2016, the Superintendence
    of the Environment (“SMA” for its acronym in Spanish) determined that the minutes
    presented by the company in 2014 did not fulfill its obligation to obtain the
    consent of the communities identified during the evaluation regarding the mitigation
    measure associated with the site of cultural significance, as required by the
    environmental permit for the Osorno Plant. The SMA also observed that it was not
    possible to determine whether the methodology used by EEP complied with the standards
    of ILO Convention 169 and whether the participation process should only include
    organizations with legal status identified unilaterally by the company (Superintendencia
    del Medio Ambiente 2016). Consequently, the SMA requested the Environmental Evaluation
    Service (“SEA” for its acronym in Spanish) to administratively interpret this
    issue. Based on this administrative consultation, the SEA validated the criteria
    used by the EEP to determine which communities could participate in this indigenous
    participation procedure. Along with the above, the SEA pointed out that this participation
    process was not an indigenous consultation as such, since it was an obligation
    of the company, but that both the methodology and the meaning and scope of the
    term \"consent\" in the permit environment should comply with ILO Convention 169
    and the national regulation of the indigenous right to prior consultation (Servicio
    de Evaluación Ambiental 2016). To reverse this judgement, Machi Millaray, together
    with the Koyam Ke Che Community and the Wenuleufu Association, opposed this decision
    before the Second Environmental Court, arguing that the SEA had illegally omitted
    the technical opinion of CONADI, and that the obligation to implement an indigenous
    consultation process was a duty of the Chilean state and not of a private company.
    This action was accepted by the Second Environmental Court (Huichalaf Pradines
    Millaray y otro/Dirección ejecutiva del Servicio de Evaluación Ambiental (Res.
    Ex. N° 0711 and de 6 de junio de 2018) 2018) 2020) and subsequently confirmed
    by the Supreme Court (Huichalaf/Servicio de Evaluación Ambiental 2020), ordering
    the SEA to reopen the procedure for interpretation of the RCA, this time with
    CONADI’s pronouncement to clarify the controversial aspects of the environmental
    license. Although Statkraft recently announced that it had renounced the environmental
    permit for the Osorno power plant -given its impacts on the “site of cultural
    significance” inhabited by the Ngen Kintuantü, prioritizing the construction of
    the Los Lagos power plant (M.T.G., interview, April 10, 2023)-, the negotiations
    initiated by EEP (and continued by Statkraft) have led to internal divisions that
    have had lasting effects on the forms of representation of the ancestral organizations
    and authorities of the territory (Kelly, Guerra-Schleef, and Valdés-Negroni 2021).
    From this process, new indigenous communities with legal status have emerged,
    such as Koyam Ke Che, which organizes the dissident families of El Roble, which,
    together with indigenous community Leufu Pilmaiquén Maihue, have organized opposition
    to the company’s hydroelectric projects on the Pilmaiquén River. However, this
    shows the fractures in the families and sociological communities of these territories,
    where the cleavage has been the support or rejection of the hydroelectric projects.
    The conflict over indigenous representation also led to the creation of the Wenuleufu
    Association, which brings together several pu Lonko of the territory, as well
    as 47 communities with legal status in the commune of Río Bueno. In 2014 Statkraft
    purchased the hydroelectric projects, water rights, and land rights of the project
    (Maria Teresa González, interview, April 10, 2023). As other scholars have demonstrated,
    a market exists in Chile for purchasing water rights with approved EISs (Kelly
    and Negroni 2020). As the current landowner, Statkraft has upheld EEP’s refusal
    to sell to CONADI the lands where a fundamental part of the natural complex for
    ceremonial use around the Pilmaiquén river is located (Empresa Eléctrica Pilmaiquén
    S.A 2013), arguing that they have acquired these lands for the purpose of handing
    over the ceremonial area to the indigenous communities (Empresa Eléctrica Pilmaiquén
    S.A./Statkraft Chile Inversiones Electricas Ltda. 2021a). Relatedly, in 2018 Statkraft
    circulated a proposal with the main organizations and ancestral authorities who
    represent the territory, requesting that they identify the legal figure that would
    hold title to the transfer (Statkraft 2018). This has been used by CONADI as an
    excuse to advance in the purchase procedure, the only mechanism contemplated in
    the Chilean legal system to solve this type of territorial conflicts, granting
    to the company -Statkraft- the responsibility of defining when, how and to whom
    the registered ownership of the central part of the ceremonial complex where the
    Kintuantü inhabits will be assigned (Corporación Nacional de Desarrollo Indígena
    2021). As a lawyer collaborating with the ancestral authorities and Mapuche-Williche
    communities that oppose these hydroelectric projects, I have been able to observe
    how, as the conflict has escalated and the communities have used the institutional
    mechanisms available to exercise their rights, this company has strategically
    used its commitment to restore the land where Ngen Mapu Kintuantü’s house is located.
    Effectively, they have favored those people with whom it has negotiated since
    the environmental evaluation of the Osorno Power Plant and forced confrontation
    with the communities of the territory around the ownership of this important complex
    Mapuche-Williche ceremonial. It is important to note that Statkraft has not only
    inherited the negotiations and agreements, but has maintained and used them strategically
    in the context of the construction of the Los Lagos power plant, taking an active
    role in direct negotiation with the communities, appealing both to the condition
    imposed in the environmental permit for the Osorno power plant and to its corporate
    commitments to the human rights of indigenous peoples (Statkraft 2022, 66). However,
    the ancestral authorities and Mapuche-Williche organizations that oppose these
    projects (Empresa Eléctrica Pilmaiquén S.A./Statkraft Chile Inversiones Eléctricas
    Ltda 2021a) have refused to participate in the company’s dialogue, arguing that
    it would be a strategy that only seeks to confront local communities around the
    ownership of part of the ceremonial natural complex, in circumstances where the
    responsibility for the return of this sacred space is an obligation of the Chilean
    State (Aylwin, Didier, and Guerra 2019, 65–66). An important milestone in this
    process occurred in May 2021, when the ancestral authorities and Mapuche-Williche
    communities that oppose the hydroelectric plants on the Pilmaiquén River became
    aware of Statkraft’s unilateral decision to transfer the land where the Ngen Mapu
    Kintuantü is located to an indigenous association with legal personality called
    Señor Kintuantü, recently created with the support of the company. In the words
    of a Statkraft representative in Chile, this organization would group together
    the lepunero who would be “the true ancestral authorities of the territory” (K.O.,
    interview, April 10, 2023). This occurred in the context of a consultancy research
    commissioned by Statkraft and carried out by a Chilean academic institution to
    identify the organization that would be the owner of the transfer (Empresa Eléctrica
    Pilmaiquén S.A./Statkraft Chile Inversiones Eléctricas Ltda 2021a). However, I
    have also observed that while Statkraft has negotiated and articulated support
    in the communities closest to the proposed power plants and maintained the strategy
    launched in the context of the environmental assessment of the Osorno Power Plant;
    the ancestral organizations and authorities that oppose these initiatives have
    revitalized political alliances with the communities of the extensive territory
    for which the Ngen Mapu Kintuantü is a spiritual reference, as is the case of
    those located around the Caulle Volcanic Range and in the coast. In short, even
    though Statkraft’s strategy of transferring ownership of the land where Ngen Kintuantü’s
    residence is located is currently paralyzed by a Supreme Court ruling 6, I have
    been able to verify how community relations nearest to hydroelectric development
    have deteriorated and conflicts between families and community members have become
    more acute. Likewise, profound changes are evident in the forms of Mapuche-Williche
    representation of the territory. The use of institutional and legal mechanisms
    by ancestral organizations and authorities that oppose Statkraft’s initiatives
    in the Pilmaiquén River 7 has led the company to support the creation of new indigenous
    organizations with legal personality in the territory that are functional to the
    interests of the company. In this way, negotiations have modified community interactions
    for more than 15 years, causing fractures and divisions in families that will
    last for a long time (Kelly, Guerra-Schleef, and Valdés-Negroni 2021). The continuous
    interventions have generated friction in the territory and have consolidated the
    divisions between the various organizations that have arisen as the conflict has
    developed in the basin. This, of course, does not mean that there is perfect unity
    among those who oppose Statkraft’s projects. There is a history of alliances and
    divisions, at the center of which are the interventions and negotiations of the
    company that owns the Los Lagos and Osorno power plants. Discussion: the Pilmaiken
    case as a site of legal pluralism In this section I discuss the limits of the
    translation process that has taken place in my case study, exploring two equivocations
    that are made explicit in this case. First equivocal site: from ngen to “site
    of cultural significance” To understand the problems of hermeneutic injustice,
    as well as the complexities and interrelationships that exist at the heart of
    the Pilmaiken case as a site of legal pluralism, we must first explore the ontological
    aspects that define each of the legal spheres that are interacting in this territory.
    This allows us to examine the equivocations that emerge from this conflict that
    affect the way in which the impacts of these projects on the river, communities
    and ngen are understood. When we turn to the AzMapu of the ceremonial complex
    inhabited by the Ngen Kintuantü and Kilen Wentru, it is possible to observe how
    water is considered not only as H2O or a natural resource available for exploitation,
    but as a profoundly important actor in the realization of all aspects of life,
    as well as an assembling force between human and non-human collectives, connecting
    the living with their ancestors. In this way, the fragmentation of the Pilmaiquén
    river for the Mapuche communities is not only the loss of a productive resource,
    but also has a series of impacts on the normative world of the communities, the
    Ngen Mapu and the forces (newen) that maintain the cosmic balances between human
    beings (past, present and future) and non-human beings that inhabit the territory.
    As noted, for Geertz ( 1983) worldviews are always normative and, consequently,
    empirical experiences are inevitably interwoven with the symbolic worlds we inhabit.
    In relation to the case study, the local norms, rights, and obligations that regulate
    how water should be managed, reflect, and reproduce a symbolic order regarding
    what water is and how people should relate to it. This symbolic order is based
    on concrete ethics and shared values that are rooted in the material relationships
    among people, watercourses and ngen mapu, where obligations are not separate to
    water-related traditions and customs. Thus, the spiritual geography of the ngen
    is at the same time a geographical representation of the normative world of the
    communities, which is central to understanding how they contextualize the impacts
    of hydropower plants both in relation to themselves and to the river. The rules,
    rights, and obligations of communities, as well as their vernacular ways of imagining
    water, are not pre-political, nor are they frozen in time and space, nor are they
    purely cultural. They are always becoming something different in relation to the
    political-economic processes, power relations and conflicts where they are located.
    That is why the Williche communities are constantly transforming and mobilizing
    their normative worlds, as a way of confronting the state law that aims to standardize
    how water should be managed and, more specifically, to evaluate the environmental
    impacts that certain development projects may have on rivers. Considering the
    EIAS as a privileged site where the conflict we are studying has been channeled,
    this mobilization has occurred within a certain political economy of water reproduced
    by state rules, rights and obligations that present water under the state and
    neoliberal symbolic order: as a resource that can be freely appropriated and traded,
    and that can be managed regardless of who the holders of the land rights are.
    It is at this point where a first equivocation or hermeneutic problem of translation
    arises between the different legal spheres and sensibilities that are interacting
    in this case. As noted, defining the term ngen from the perspective of the communities,
    as well as the dense cosmogony surrounding the natural complex for ceremonial
    use that exist around Pilmaiquén river, is an extremely complex task. This is
    the reason why, to make this reality understandable for the environmental institutions
    in the environmental assessment, the concept of “site of cultural significance”
    is used. However, as Llancaman points out: From ngen to ‘site’ there is a considerable
    distance. A site […] can be measured and identified in coordinates, it is thus
    delimited and enclosed. The ngen on the other hand cannot be understood as contained
    in limits, it represents in every sense an excess […]. Ngen is in-common […],
    and from my perspective, the first word about ngen is that even when it includes
    human beings, it does not depend on them, and in turn the human cannot be conceived
    as separate from the first (Llancaman 2020, 5). The need to prefer the reference
    to “site of cultural significance” instead of ngen, is also operated in the environmental
    assessment, as well as in other spheres of state law, by the anthropological language
    of religious practice. Although this code external to the communities allows,
    to a certain extent, the ngen to enter the technical environmental discussion,
    it organizes the normative Williche worlds on the side of religious practice,
    reinforcing the old western division between nature and culture and subtracting
    the complex meanings of the original word to the choice of the institutional observer
    (Llancaman 2020; Kelly, Guerra-Schleef, and Valdés-Negroni 2021). Such was the
    reading that finally prevailed in the evaluation of the Central Osorno. Thus,
    it was enough for the owner to propose the filling of the alluvial terrace that
    is part of the dwelling of the Ngen Kintuantü, so that the communities could continue
    accessing the place to practice their prayers, for the impacts to be considered
    as minimized from the perspective of the State and the company. This reduction
    of significance is understandable within the dynamics of the conflict: the category
    “site of cultural significance” is a criterion that can be admitted as an argument
    for environmental institutions since it is comparable and measurable. In view
    of the need to exchange information and communicate experiences about living in
    space, the communities can accept the reduction of the new term, even if it is
    insufficient. In other words, mediation through religious practice is the way
    state regulation incorporates the contents of the normative Williche worlds, but
    via foreign categories (Tsosie 2012; Tsosie 2017). However, this way of understanding
    the impacts of this project is based on a fragmentary understanding of the territory
    (Kelly, Guerra-Schleef, and Valdés-Negroni 2021), which is produced by a mismatch
    between discursive practices that make central aspects of the experience of the
    affected communities unintelligible to the environmental assessment. As we have
    seen, the sacred spaces that the communities have fought to protect are not only
    “land” or “water”, but they are also more than that; they are the river, known
    people, guardian beings, forces and living beings (Cadena 2015). Therefore, the
    water of this territory cannot be treated as a mere object over which a person
    can claim ownership, to be managed independently of the other beings (human and
    non-human) that inhabit the territory. Thinking of rivers and water in Mapuche-Williche
    territories (whether or not labeled as \"sacred\") as places of equivocation –which
    allow circuits between partially connected worlds, without necessarily creating
    a unified system- can help to become aware of how the Chilean legal system transforms
    indigenous socio-natural worlds in its attempt to make them legible within its
    conceptual coordinates. As Marisol de la Cadena ( 2010) argues, when we do not
    become aware that rivers (or any other entity whose meaning we do not doubt) are
    equivocal, the dispute is interpreted as a \"problem between two cultures\" rather
    than an ontological controversy (351–352). In this way, the destiny of the river
    and the ngen mapu is defined by the only culture that, claiming universal principles,
    provides \"technical\" solutions that, however, are incapable of avoiding possible
    local deaths. Thus, if we want to obtain different results, we must take the problem
    to a different plane; to the political moment in which the ontological division
    between humans and nature arises and creates politics as a human affair and relegates
    nature to scientific representation. Seen from this perspective -which reveals
    the epistemic politics of modern politics- the conflict would change and, instead
    of a cultural problem between universal progress and local \"beliefs\", the fate
    of the river and the ngen mapu emerges as a conflict between worlds, requiring
    symmetrical disagreement. In other words, by mobilizing the river and its ngen
    as sensitive entities, the Mapuche-Williche communities and ancestral authorities
    of this territory do not invoke a “belief” (which reproduces the Western dualism
    “science/belief” or “nature/culture”); but, as Escobar argues, “[…] from a whole
    episteme and ontology that do not function on the basis of these binaries” (Escobar
    2014, 117). In this “relational ontologies”, as Escobar calls them, humans, and
    non-humans (the organic, the non-organic, and the supernatural or spiritual) form
    an integral part of the world of the communities of this territory in their multiple
    interrelationships as sentient beings (Escobar 2014). Second equivocal site: spatial
    logics of impact Relatedly, a second equivocation emerges in this case related
    to the various spatial logics that interact in this case, which, in my opinion,
    demonstrates that the Chilean state is not the only actor that is giving meaning
    to indigenous rights. As discussed, in this case it was the incumbent company
    that ultimately determined the spatial scope of its project’s affectation, enacting
    a key state administrative practice, such as defining who will be considered as
    affected and, therefore, as interested persons: holders of rights and interests
    that will be compromised with the implementation of the project. As shown in the
    Pilmaiken case, the company strategically took advantage of this situation, identifying
    as directly affected only the closest indigenous communities with the legal status
    and with which it has negotiated. This strategy, as we have seen, was validated
    by the Chilean state in the framework of the environmental assessment of the Osorno
    Power Plant and, even though this project is currently abandoned, it has been
    projected in time beyond this administrative procedure. This is evident in the
    way in which this company has used its previous negotiations with the communities
    that it itself identified as affected during the environmental evaluation process
    of the Osorno Power Plant and the property it maintains on the land where Ngen
    Kintuantü’s residence is located, in the context of the development and construction
    of the Los Lagos Power Plant. However, this spatial logic defined by the company
    in charge of these projects is opposed to the broader spiritual and legal geography
    of the natural complex of ceremonial use that exists around the Pilmaiquén River.
    Indeed, in contrast to the State’s and the company’s drive to spatially limit
    the impacts - and, consequently, who is affected - the communities that oppose
    these hydroelectric projects claim that the river, the ngen and all the communities
    whose territories make up the spiritual chain around this natural ceremonial center
    are affected. This is because, although the communities closest to the Ngen Kintuantü
    play the role of custodians of the space, they are not the “owners” of the site,
    insofar as ownership of the ngen is inconceivable from their AzMapu. From this
    perspective, it is not enough for the owner company to negotiate the consent of
    some families and nearby communities to validate the intervention of this ceremonial
    complex, since what is at stake in this case is a territory in its broad material,
    epistemic, cultural, and ontological conception. Conclusions In this paper I have
    used various analytical tools from anthropology to construct a framework that
    allows us to examine the problems of structural hermeneutic injustice that emerge
    in the Pilmaiken case as a site of legal pluralism. I have focused my analysis
    on two equivocations arising from the process through which the environmental
    institutionality translated the dense normativity of the Mapuche-Williche communities
    around the Pilmaiquén River and the Ngen Mapu Kintuantü during the environmental
    assessment of the Osorno Hydroelectric Power Plant, with the aim of making the
    impacts of this project legible in this institutional context. As I argued, in
    this case, the institutional translation of ngen to “site of cultural significance”,
    as well as the company’s subsequent proposal to fill in the terrace that is part
    of the dwelling of the Ngen Mapu Kintuantü, reproduced a structural form of epistemic
    injustice of a hermeneutic type, reflecting the political and business impulse
    behind dominant multiculturalism, which continues to reduce the normative and
    juridical worlds of indigenous peoples to mere folklore, to a mere belief that
    belongs to another “culture”. This, moreover, has had long-lasting effects on
    the way in which the company and the environmental institutions have understood
    the spatial dimension of the impacts of these projects in relation to the communities
    linked to the natural ceremonial complex that exists around the Pilmaiquén River.
    Now, with this I do not mean to argue that the category of “site of cultural significance”
    cannot be re-signified and epistemically decolonized in a new scenario. However,
    to move in this direction it is essential to be aware of the Western religious
    discourse and practice that operates through this category, which reproduces models
    of thought based on a dualistic rationality: the nature/culture binary. The change
    of shared understandings is not an automatic process of hermeneutical redefinition
    but requires political actions aimed at disrupting the power relations that underlie
    these understandings, making visible exclusion, institutional violence and what
    Pohlhaus has called “willful hermeneutical ignorance” (Pohlhaus 2012). In this
    sense, I consider that both Fricker’s analytical lens on epistemic injustice and
    the development of contemporary studies on legal pluralism, can help us illuminate
    forms of injustice that are often invisible to all but the affected groups. From
    this perspective, the emphasis placed on legal pluralism allows us to contest
    and decentralize state law, as a privileged site where collective meanings are
    generated in contemporary societies. As Rebecca Tsosie argues, by naming what
    is happening, contesting dominant ways of imagining the real, and reconceptualizing
    the ways in which we must relate to each other and to our environment, indigenous
    peoples could engage in a cross-cultural understanding of state legal categories
    (Tsosie 2017, 366). Indigenous peoples understand time and place differently and
    possess unique forms of knowledge and legal systems of their own that are rooted
    in long-standing genealogical relationships with the territories they have inhabited.
    This allows them to make visible what informs their realities and worlds. However,
    for this to happen, it is essential that internationally and nationally guaranteed
    indigenous rights enable the necessary and appropriate spaces for intercultural
    dialogue for the decolonization of state juridical categories. In short, it is
    a matter of understanding that the different peoples who live within the geopolitical
    space defined by current state borders have different epistemic frameworks with
    respect to which they imagine their worlds and live their lives, and that it is
    necessary to build bridges of communication between these worlds to generate fairer
    representations of them. These types of changes are extremely complex and difficult
    to achieve, since, as Mariana Ortega points out, they imply really engaging in
    activities in which one will experience what others experience; understanding
    problems from their perspectives and imagining what their worlds mean (difficult
    as this is); deal with people of flesh and blood, and not only with their theoretical
    constructions; learn the language of the people to understand them better and
    not use it against them; really listening to other people’s interpretations, however
    different they may be from your own; and see people as worthy of respect instead
    of helpless beings who need help (Ortega 2006, 69). It is, finally, an embodied
    commitment, in which we expose ourselves to a form of communication that is not
    simply analogical, but transconceptual. From this perspective, intercultural dialogue
    is a call to “travel”, to try to experience and understand the “world” of others
    who are different; open the possibility of crossing cultural, racial and ethnic
    boundaries (Ortega 2006, 68–69). Moreover, as Mariana Ortega points out, it seems
    that those who “travel the world” the most are already marginalized beings, since
    they are the ones who are usually forced to travel to the dominant world (Ortega
    2006, 69). The question, then, is how to convince those who are part of the dominant
    world to travel to marginalized worlds? As the Pilmaiken case shows, marginally
    situated communities have elaborate epistemic resources that resist a distorted
    sense of knowing and making known their normative worlds around the river and
    water. The solution is for the dominant situated institutional knowers to catch
    up and learn to use the epistemic resources they lack by forging interdependent
    and truly cooperative relationships with the marginally situated knowers. In this
    context, I believe that Fricker’s proposal to address forms of epistemic injustice
    exclusively through the cultivation of individual corrective virtues is insufficient
    to redress the structural forms of epistemic injustice experienced by indigenous
    peoples within the settler societies in which they currently live. This is the
    reason why, rather than solutions focused on individual virtues, the remedy that
    international human rights law has articulated to address these situations has
    been through what Anderson identifies as \"structural remedies\" (Anderson 2012).
    This includes indigenous peoples’ rights of participation and consent, which allow
    indigenous peoples to speak for themselves, collectively (through their representative
    institutions), using their own methodologies of deliberation and decision-making.

    which from the polysemy of Mapuzugun captures different dimensions and meanings-
    refers to the ordering of things, social life, cultural practices, and ceremonies,
    as well as the cycles of life (mogen); while the notion of Mapu refers to the
    space where life is reproduced in its various forms and manifestations (Melin-Pehuen
    et al. 2016, 20-21). 4 Currently, the Norwegian state-owned company Statkraft,
    through its Chilean firm EEP, operates the Rucatayo hydroelectric plant on the
    Pilmaiquén river, which obtained its environmental qualification in 2006, and
    plans the construction of two other hydroelectric plants downstream on the same
    river: the Los Lagos and Osorno hydroelectric plants. These hydroelectric plants,
    together with the transmission line, were environmentally assessed in parallel
    but separately, both obtaining their environmental permits in June 2009. in this
    way, the synergistic and cumulative impacts of these projects, which are part
    of the same hydroelectric development plan in the Pilmaiquén river basin, were
    not considered. 5 The current environmental institutional framework is based on
    the reforms introduced by Act 20,417 of 2010 to Act 19,300 on General Bases of
    the Environment, which created the Ministry of the Environment (in charge of environmental
    regulation and policy), the SMA (with oversight and sanction functions) and the
    Environmental Evaluation Service (in charge of environmental evaluation). The
    Act also conditioned the entry into force of the SMA with the creation of the
    Environmental Courts (Act 20,600 of 2012). 6 Through its judgment of January 20,
    2022, the Supreme Court accepted the protective measure filed by Machi Millaray,
    the Koyam Ke Che and Leufu Pilmaiquén Maihue indigenous communities, and the Puyehue
    Community Council, ordering CONADI to proceed progressively to the petition of
    the defendants regarding the Ngen Mapu Kintuantü Ceremonial Center, considering
    the interests of all the Mapuche-Williche communities linked to this sacred natural
    space. This made it possible to paralyze the transfer that Statkraft had been
    promoting up to that moment (Comunidad Indígena Leufu Pilmaiquén Maihue/Statkraft
    Chile Inversiones Eléctricas Limitada 2022). 7 In this regard, an important case
    has been the protective measure filed by Machi Millaray and the Leufu Pilmaiquén
    Maihue and Koyam Ke Che communities for the lack of prior consultation regarding
    the permits to be granted by the National Monuments Council to intervene in the
    Mapuche archaeological sites identified during the construction of the Los Lagos
    hydroelectric power plant. This filing was accepted by the Supreme Court on November
    19, 2021 (Comunidad Indígena Leufu Pilmaiquén Maihue/Dirección de Bibliotecas

  explanation: The study in question investigates strategies for automating real-time
    irrigation systems, with a particular focus on providing user-friendly interfaces
    (for example, mobile apps or web dashboards) to enable farmers to input their
    preferences, constraints, and expert knowledge into the automated irrigation system.
    This is important because it allows farmers to have a say in how their irrigation
    systems operate, ensuring that the systems are tailored to their specific needs
    and preferences.

    modeling 1. Introduction The critical infrastructure we rely upon daily to provide
    services such as electricity, water, and sewage disposal is largely dependent
    on each other [1]. For example, the pumps throughout the water supply network
    rely on electricity to function, and wastewater treatment plants require electricity
    to treat incoming sewage. Similarly, water is used for cooling in electricity
    generation, and a physical disruption in the water or wastewater networks could
    impact nearby electrical substations. Because of this interdependence (and dependence)
    between systems, there can be unforeseen impacts due to cascading failures, which
    occur when one system failure causes another system to fail. While redundancies
    can be incorporated into networks (such as backup generators), the increasing
    variability and intensity of natural hazards expected to occur as a result of
    climate change means we need to consider future scenarios and how cascading failures
    may be triggered [2]. Examples of such events include the power outages in Texas
    due to the recent 2021 winter storm [3], in Puerto Rico due to Hurricane Maria
    in 2017 [4], in the 2005 Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans [5], along the U.S.
    East Coast in 2012 from Hurricane Sandy [6], and in Christchurch following the
    2011 earthquakes [7]. These are disruptive and costly events that call for proactive
    measures to develop resilient infrastructure, which are often more cost-effective
    in the long term. In one study looking at infrastructure in thousands of different
    climate scenarios for low- and middle-income countries, a $1 investment in more
    resilient infrastructure had a benefit of $4, with an overall net benefit of $4.2
    trillion across these countries [8]. Understanding cascading impacts can help
    decision-makers and utility operators develop more robust infrastructure and limit
    damage and costs when recovering from natural hazards. These interdependencies
    present a challenge for assessing and modeling risk in these systems. One framework
    to understand the interactions categorizes interdependence into physical, cyber,
    geographic, and logical interdependencies [1]. A review performed by Ouyang [9],
    further classified modeling approaches into six categories: empirical, agent-based,
    system dynamics-based, economic theory-based, network-based, and others. More
    recently, He and Cha [10] performed an extensive review of recovery and resilience
    modeling of infrastructure systems under disruptive events, reiterating most of
    the categorizations defined by Ouyang [9]: agent-based, system dynamics-based,
    input–output-based, computable general equilibrium-based, network topology-based,
    and network flow-based approaches. He and Cha [11] also differentiated the resolution
    of infrastructure modeling into system-to-system level, facility-to-facility level,
    and system-to-facility level, where the system could mean an entire power or water
    system while the facility could be the specific nodes within the system such as
    the pumping stations and electrical substations. Each of these methodologies have
    their trade-offs and advantages depending on the conditions such as the particular
    infrastructure, data, and complexity. Existing studies that demonstrate these
    methodologies and investigate hazard-related risks to infrastructure often focus
    on a single infrastructure system (e.g., [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18],
    [19]) or present a regional [7], [11], [20], [21] or national [22], [23], [24],
    [25], [26], aggregated view on cascading failures. Regional and national studies
    assess large-scale trends or identify nationally critical nodes, while those that
    look at the city-scale use a similarly large data resolution or an idealized network.
    However, these studies have not sufficiently examined the intricacies of real-world
    and multiple networks or the local-level impacts on residents from cascading failures,
    which could highlight inequities in the community [27]. For example, Guidotti
    et al. [28] investigated an idealized interdependent network, which proposed a
    modeling framework that includes the recovery to get the infrastructure back online
    (also considered in [29] from a risk theory perspective, Sun and Zhang [30] for
    a transportation infrastructure, and González et al. [31] to power, water, and
    gas in Shelby County, TN, USA), but this example, which uses an idealized network,
    does not convey the geospatial impacts of the cascading failures on a real-world
    urban case study. Among the current body of work, the models largely incorporate
    business-as-usual hazards, such as earthquakes, previous hurricanes, and recurring
    flood events, which do not address divergent, uncertain scenarios such as events
    influenced by climate change [32] and need to be included in modeling to support
    the decision-making related to these impacts [33]. This uncertain future presented
    by climate change is among one of many uncertainties that are often neglected
    in models of interdependent infrastructure [34]. Additionally, there is a lack
    of metrics that address the impacts at the business and residential level [35],
    rather focusing on the system- or infrastructure-level resilience [19], [36],
    [37], [38] in terms of reduction of consequence [39] and functionality loss [30].
    Common metrics include lost load, in which an assumption is made about utility
    use across the users, and economic impact, which places a certain valuation on
    functionality and may lead to underestimation of the impacts to different demographics.
    Wang et al. [40] describes a framework to understand interdependent infrastructure,
    applying a network model to the power and water systems of a city in China. This
    study uses network statistics to compare the impacts from a regional level, assessing
    the functionality of the infrastructure networks as opposed to the local impacts
    to the residents. Other studies similarly use recovery times and network statistics
    to assess the resilience or impacts to infrastructure [13], [41], [42], [43],
    which conveys the risk to the infrastructure, but stops short of understanding
    the residential impacts, in magnitude and geospatial location. In [44], the authors
    use social vulnerability indicators to look at cascading impacts from both random
    failures and Hurricane Irma on Tampa, Florida, however this is only for the community
    level and two interconnected systems (the water and transportation networks).
    While many of these studies work towards developing new methodologies to model
    interdependent infrastructure, few test the application in real-world case studies,
    which are important for understanding risk and how it plays out in interdependent
    infrastructure systems. The need to assess the performance of these theoretical
    models under different hazards and real-world conditions is highlighted both in
    model development studies and comprehensive reviews of modeling approaches [9],
    [10], [36]. Additionally, many authors apply their models to idealized and business-as-usual
    scenarios (for both the network and the hazard) which may perform differently
    than when applied to real networks with divergent hazards, and limit their applications
    to one or two networks. Few of these studies, even those at the facilities level,
    include granularity on the scale of residential properties, which can more accurately
    show the social cascading impacts. Our work addresses these gaps by applying an
    updated network model to the real-world infrastructure of Ōtautahi/Christchurch
    in New Zealand experiencing the hazard of coastal flooding under climate change
    and shows the cascading impacts from the infrastructure level down to the household
    level. Specifically, we examine the electricity, water supply, and wastewater
    networks within the city using real-world data, and investigate how impacts across
    all three systems translate to the end users throughout the community and the
    utilities, across a range of climate change scenarios. Therefore, we provide a
    quantitative assessment of direct and indirect risk and a qualitative discussion
    of the relative importance of its inclusion in a holistic risk assessment. We
    answer two important questions: (1) to what extent do indirect impacts change
    the assessment of risk to residents? and (2) how are impacts spatially distributed
    throughout the community? The next section describes the network model that was
    developed and run, the case study location and hazard selected for this simulation,
    and the specific data used for this analysis. Section 3 describes the geospatial
    and numerical results of the model, which are further explained in Section 4.
    2. Methodology To begin, we developed a generalizable model of the integrated
    infrastructure networks and the communities they serve. Within the model, we simulate
    an event which directly impacts a subset of the utilities and users. Then, the
    properties dependent on the directly impacted assets are determined, after which
    the model quantitatively assesses both the direct and indirect risks from the
    event. Our model can be used on any city and incorporate any number of infrastructure
    networks as well as events (e.g. natural hazards, system failures, and malicious
    activity). The following subsections detail how this is conducted and introduces
    an application on an urban case study. 2.1. Model preparation First, geospatial
    data for each selected infrastructure system (e.g., water services, telecommunications,
    and electricity, which we call utilities) and the associated end users or properties
    (e.g., households, supermarkets, and businesses) for the study area are collected
    as inputs to the model. All together, this collection of data sets represents
    the system in study. At this stage, connections between the infrastructure and
    end users have not yet been established, but a baseline scenario of the system’s
    functionality can be determined. The other primary set of input data is the extent
    of the event, which is also included in the model as a geospatial data set. This
    could be a numeric value representing a hazard intensity, such as water depth
    or wind speed, or a Boolean indication of whether the area is exposed or not to
    the hazard. For this description, the event represents a single possible scenario,
    while in the case study, we iterate a series of scenarios through the model to
    create a portfolio of results. Next, the impact of the event is superimposed on
    the system, and the system elements (here the term elements or nodes includes
    both utility infrastructure and end users) are designated as either functional
    or out of service after the event. The functionality of the system elements after
    being exposed by the hazard are based on fragility curves, which define a functionality
    after a particular amount of exposure (e.g., water depth for flooding or peak
    ground acceleration for earthquakes). The specific components of the assets are
    not considered (e.g., the transformers or the pump housing), but rather the entire
    asset themselves (e.g., the substation building, the pumping station building,
    the residential house, etc.). For this study, we look at the worst-case scenario
    of exposure and simply use a single step fragility curve function, where any exposure
    means the particular element has failed. With imminent coastal flooding, these
    systems would be expected to be turned off before they are exposed or at the moment
    they become exposed, and households will be evacuated if any flooding has occurred.
    Therefore, while it is possible to incorporate partial functionality, this is
    not entirely insightful for this case study. The vulnerability of the links are
    not considered in this study, primarily for the reason that for coastal flooding,
    the overhead power lines and the underground pipelines are not often the critical
    points of failure. This model uses a network topology-based approach, and thus
    does not consider the specific flows throughout the systems, such as potential
    overloads on the electrical power or water networks. This set of results represents
    the direct impacts, which can be mapped to show the immediate loss of service
    from the event. Download : Download high-res image (213KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 1. Diagram showing the general workflow used to assess direct
    and indirect impacts. 2.2. Network analysis To capture the indirect impacts, we
    leverage a network representation of our interdependent system. Each of the system
    elements are represented by a vertex, or node, in our network model, which can
    be connected to other infrastructures or end users via an edge, or link. Depending
    on the situation, the edges between the vertices may follow specific rules as
    to which vertices they are connecting (e.g., connecting an electric zone substation
    to a particular grid exit point), while for others, the edges may be generated
    based on proximity (e.g., connecting a household to the nearest wastewater treatment
    plant). The whole system (i.e., infrastructure vertices, end user vertices, and
    edges between these vertices) can be represented by an adjacency matrix, with
    the size of the matrix being proportional to the total number of vertices. Within
    the adjacency matrix, the edges between vertices are represented by a Boolean
    value (with 1 indicating a connection and 0 indicating no connection) [45]. More
    information on the network representation can be found in Appendix B. With the
    network representation of the system, the initial loss in service from the event
    is cascaded through the matrix to simulate the indirect loss of service. This
    is done by identifying the directly impacted vertices from the superimposed event
    on the system, as described in the previous section, and setting any connected
    vertices’ value to 0 in the adjacency matrix, signifying a loss in connection.
    This step of identifying connected vertices and setting the dependent vertices’
    matrix values to 0 is repeated with the disconnected vertices to capture the successive
    indirect impacts until there are no more dependencies. The vertices that have
    lost connection are recorded, so that indirect impacts can be mapped. Another
    metric that has been integrated into the model is a calculation for end degree,
    which is a modified calculation of vertex degree. Here, we designate end degree
    as the total number of end users connected to a particular vertex in the network.
    This is a helpful metric to identify critical nodes from an end-user perspective.
    We calculate end degree for both the fully functional system and the impacted
    system (including both direct and indirect impacts). With this, we can understand
    the overall loss in connection throughout the system from an event. Further, we
    can provide insight to the utilities both in terms of which nodes lose the most
    service and which still have connections following an event. This process, shown
    in Fig. 1, provides an approach to determine the indirect impacts that result
    from an event, including impacts on the infrastructure, the end users, and the
    system as a whole. The next section details the use of the model on a real-world
    network. 2.3. Case study In this case study, the effects of a range of potential
    coastal flooding events on three interconnected systems in Christchurch, New Zealand
    are investigated: the electric power network, the water supply network, and the
    wastewater network. 2.3.1. Background Ōtautahi/Christchurch, the second largest
    city by urban population in Aotearoa New Zealand, is a low-lying, coastal city
    on the eastern coast of New Zealand’s South Island (Fig. 2). There are roughly
    392,000 inhabitants within an area of approximately 295 square kilometers, resulting
    in a population density of about 1300 people per square kilometer. The city has
    two rivers flowing through it, the Avon River through the city center and the
    Heathcote River on the south side, which flow into an estuary and make certain
    areas more prone to flooding from both fluvial and coastal events. Christchurch
    experienced severe disruptions from earthquakes in 2010 and 2011, due to ground
    motion as well as liquefaction [46], and wildfires in the Port Hills surrounding
    the city in 2017 [47], and it is threatened by coastal hazards (such as coastal
    flooding, coastal erosion, and rising groundwater), tsunamis, and landslides [48],
    which may become more common as the climate becomes warmer [49], [50]. As such,
    it is a relevant case study for our model. Download : Download high-res image

    in New Zealand, highlighting the downtown area and larger infrastructure nodes.
    2.3.2. Coastal flooding We focus this case study on coastal flooding, which is
    a relevant hazard for many communities along shorelines that will only intensify
    with climate change [51]. These events are often described in terms of their average
    recurrence interval [ARI], which is an indication of how many years are expected
    on average to be between events. For example, a 100-year ARI for a coastal flooding
    event would reflect the extent and severity of the flooding that would be expected
    about once every 100 years. This hazard is exacerbated by sea level rise [SLR],
    which can make the flooding event more frequent and/or more severe. The data in
    this study for coastal flooding is based on storm-tide-driven extreme sea levels
    [ESL]. ESLs occur from a combination of mean sea level [MSL], storm tide (which
    incorporates high tide, meteorological effects, and monthly sea level anomaly),
    the wave setup at the shoreline, and SLR. In this study, we used ESL inundation
    maps from [52] for nine ARIs (2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1000 years)
    and 0.1 m SLR increments up to 3 meters above present-day MSL. The maps were created
    using a static “bathtub” model and local LiDAR digital elevation models [DEMs]
    to map the extent and depths for inundation areas hydraulically connected to coastlines.
    These models have been developed for the entirety of New Zealand’s coastal urban
    areas, which includes Christchurch, at a resolution of 2 m. Further information
    on the methodology behind developing the coastal flooding maps can be found in
    [52]. 2.3.3. Data The infrastructure data used in this case study includes the
    electric power network [EPN], water supply network [WSN], and wastewater network
    [WWN] for Christchurch. The EPN contains transmission grid exit points, zone substations,
    network substations, and distribution substations. The WSN is made up of potable
    water supply/storage reservoirs and pump houses. The WWN has one wastewater treatment
    plant and pump houses (separate from the WSN). The three networks have dependencies
    on themselves, as well as on each other, notably on the EPN since certain nodes
    in the water and wastewater networks rely on the electricity grid for power. The
    end user nodes are determined via proxy, based off of the water meters throughout
    the city. These include residential, commercial, and industrial users. Within
    the model, we assume each of these have an independent dependency on the three
    utilities, meaning that one utility failing does not necessarily mean that the
    other utilities have failed. The connections among the utilities and end user
    nodes were primarily automated based on closest proximity by road network distance,
    since most urban utility infrastructure is underneath or alongside roads. A few
    of the connections were updated following engagement with the utility providers.
    The specific dependencies between the various system components is depicted in
    Fig. 3. Using these inputs as the system, the model was run for several coastal
    flooding hazard scenarios, varying both ARI and SLR. A hazard-specific parameter
    that can be varied in the model is the flooding depth at which an element is considered
    exposed (and thus nonfunctional). These depth thresholds can be different for
    each of the infrastructure networks as well as for the end users, but for this
    case study, it is assumed that if a node has any depth of flooding, it is at risk
    of failing. In practice, this could result from an operator safely shutting it
    off or from loss of service due to water exposure. The thresholds can be adjusted
    in order to capture the vulnerability, as opposed to exposure, of the utilities
    or households, informed by either fragility curves or by the service provider’s
    own experience and knowledge about their assets. Download : Download high-res

    and connections in the Christchurch case study. 3. Results To understand interdependence,
    the first step is to understand how many users depend on each of the assets under
    investigation. We show this in Fig. 4, which displays the infrastructure’s end
    degree for the initial, fully functional EPN, WSN, and WWN networks. To reiterate,
    this degree value represents the number of end users that are connected to that
    node, where red colors indicate a greater number of dependent end users than green
    colors. The infrastructure is spatially dispersed regarding end degree, yet some
    infrastructure nodes appear to be susceptible to even a mild coastal flooding
    event (i.e., ARI of 10 years and no SLR), shown in Fig. 5. We show the direct
    impacts from a coastal flooding event (with an ARI of 10 years and no SLR) on
    our three infrastructure networks in Fig. 5, highlighting nodes that are exposed
    to flooding, with the red nodes indicating greater inundation depth from this
    event. For this scenario, 142 EPN nodes, 12 WSN nodes, and 32 WWN nodes were directly
    exposed, out of 4360, 216, and 418 total nodes, respectively. As for the direct
    exposure on the end user nodes, 3639 out of 133,342 end users were exposed to
    the flooding, as shown in Fig. 6(a). Download : Download high-res image (993KB)

    SLR scenarios (from 0 cm of SLR to 300 cm of SLR by 10-cm increments) as well
    as different ARIs (2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, and 1000 years), both of which
    impact the severity of the coastal flooding event, was performed. The total number
    of end users directly impacted, indirectly impacted, and impacted overall was
    calculated for each of these variations. Fig. 7 shows impacts on end users for
    each infrastructure system in the 10-year ARI scenario as SLR increases. As there
    is a rise in sea level, the direct and indirect impacts follow different patterns
    due to the system’s composition, which will be explained later. When comparing
    the directly impacted properties to the total (directly and indirectly) impacted
    properties for the 10-year ARI and no SLR scenario, we see an increase of 71%
    for the electricity network, 129% for the water network, and 131% for the wastewater
    network (Fig. 7). These percentages are fairly constant as SLR increases, until
    the threshold at which the indirect values start to decrease and number of exposed
    properties overtakes the indirectly impacted properties. For the same 10-year
    ARI and 0 cm SLR scenario, there is a 216% increase between the directly impacted
    properties and the number of properties who lose at least one utility. Table 1.

    we seek to answer (1) does considering indirect impacts substantially change the
    assessment of residents impacted? and (2) how are impacts spatially distributed
    throughout the community? We have shown that in Christchurch, assessments that
    do not include the indirect impacts of coastal flooding are not only underestimating
    the total impact from the event, but also missing the spatial distribution of
    impacts from the event, both often at the expense of understanding the community-level
    effects. Risk assessments that are prepared before an event occurs will often
    try to capture the extent of loss of service either by (a) modeling the direct
    exposure of the infrastructure components or by (b) using historical statistics
    about loss of service. However, both of these approaches fall short of capturing
    the extent of impact from an event. The former is often done from the perspective
    of the utility (i.e., since the model is based around the infrastructure nodes),
    so does not accurately reflect the scope of the impact on the community, while
    the latter does not discern between the changes or updates in the system’s design.
    An infrastructure exposure assessment relies heavily on the knowledge each of
    the various utilities have available to them during and after an event. Electricity
    providers are often capable of having near-real-time data about the service they
    provide to users, while for water or wastewater networks, their service knowledge
    may stop at the extent of their own infrastructure nodes (e.g., pump houses or
    reservoirs) unless the utility providers have invested in a monitoring/sensor
    network. Using traditional statistical modeling may be useful for predicting particular
    event impacts, yet often struggles to incorporate the uncertainty that may occur
    over time (for both the disruption scenario and for the system), falling outside
    of the training data set. This is particularly relevant for impacts from climate
    change, as we can expect both disruptive scenarios we have not yet experienced
    and future development in urban environments. Our work addresses the above shortcomings
    by assessing outages throughout the infrastructure systems and the community in
    a real-world case study. When considering the end users without service after
    a coastal flooding event with an ARI of 10 years and no SLR, about 9% of total
    end users have lost at least one utility and 3.5% of total end users have lost
    all three utilities. Of those who have lost at least one utility, only about a
    third were actually exposed to flooding, meaning two thirds of the end users were
    impacted due to an indirect impact. This difference is obvious when comparing
    the map of the exposed end users (Fig. 6(a)), where the impacted nodes are clustered
    within a tight vicinity of the rivers, with the impacted end users (Fig. 6(b)),
    where additional groups of properties appear as a result of the upstream outages.
    In addition to serving as a quick visualization for the number and spatial distribution
    of affected end users, the results presented in Fig. 6(b) also reveal a more detailed
    assessment of which utilities have lost service. This is useful for emergency
    response situations, where extra supplies (e.g., clean water, portable toilets,
    backup generators, etc.) can be strategically deployed to at-risk areas and to
    provide an estimate as to how many end users might need emergency housing or accommodation.
    These spatial results can be further interpreted by looking at the plots of exposed
    properties, indirectly impacted properties, and properties with a total loss of
    service in Fig. 7, Fig. 9. The lines representing total impacts show that as SLR
    increases, the magnitude of impacts increases sporadically. Breaking this down
    into direct and indirect impacts for this system, the exposed end users steadily
    increase, while the indirect impacts on end users drives the variation in total
    impacts. The impacts of increasing SLR for properties experiencing at least one
    outage (Fig. 9) have a similar trend as outages per utility (Fig. 7), but have
    higher values of impacted end users for both indirect and total outages due to
    the variation in spatial distribution of each of the utility outages, which do
    not always overlap. The reason for the main direct and indirect trends is that
    direct flooding consistently impacts more properties as SLR increases, while large
    sections of the community are indirectly impacted all at once when an infrastructure
    node becomes exposed. Generally, indirect impacts increase as sea-level rise increases
    until a threshold, when the exposure from the event overtakes the indirectly impacted
    properties. Hence the peaks in indirect impacts in Fig. 7, Fig. 9. The sharp increases
    in the indirect impacts line (also reflected in the total impacts line), reflect
    the non-linear nature of cascading failures. In particular, these indicate that
    there are subtle tipping points, or thresholds, inherent in our interconnected
    urban infrastructure that contribute to cascading failures. When these thresholds
    are surpassed, the impacts extend to a group of nodes (be it infrastructure or
    end users), causing the number impacted to jump. These tipping points are subtle
    in that they are not immediately obvious when looking at our systems, yet have
    far-reaching second and third degree impacts. This can similarly be seen in Fig.
    8, which compares the difference in service of the 0 cm SLR scenario with the
    30 cm SLR scenario for a coastal flooding event with an ARI of 10 years. The cascading
    failure phenomena is captured by the groupings of red nodes in the maps that are
    not overlying any coastal flooding (indicated in blue) for the 30 cm SLR scenario.
    The inclusion of cascading failures in our risk analyses can help us better understand
    the structure of our interconnected systems, as well as the impacts on our communities.
    This updated approach to impact assessments has implications for the utility operators,
    showing them where there are vulnerabilities in the system, as well as providing
    insight as to where to improve robustness in their infrastructure. For the residents,
    these findings can help enhance community preparedness, by advising high risk
    neighborhoods of possible outages as well as knowing which provisions might be
    needed. Similarly, our results can guide emergency response teams by indicating
    which areas are likely to be impacted, informing them what might be needed in
    those areas, and by giving them an estimate of the amount of supplies and emergency
    accommodation needed. 5. Conclusion Our infrastructure is becoming more complex
    as it becomes more interconnected, resulting in more complex disruptions after
    an event occurs. The cascading failures that originate from these interdependencies
    are similarly intricate and difficult to model across networks. In this paper,
    we argue that these indirect impacts, such as cascading failures, should be incorporated
    in network-wide risk analyses, and provide a model to address this. We describe
    a methodology to assess direct and indirect impacts on a set of interconnected
    networks and end users and then apply this to the case study of Christchurch,
    New Zealand. The results from this application show that depending on the system,
    the indirect impacts of an event may contribute to the majority of the loss in
    service when compared to the direct impacts from the event. Risk assessments that
    neglect to include these indirect impacts are thus vastly underestimating the
    impact from an event. Another finding is that the outages of the various networks
    are not evenly spatially distributed throughout the community, meaning that different
    response and recovery measures may be needed. Such a city-wide assessment of the
    impacts to its interdependent infrastructure has not yet been performed, but we
    argue this is a key step in understanding a system’s risk, particularly when faced
    with uncertain future scenarios such as climate change. Further application of
    this model could include developing a suite of hazards to get a more complete
    picture of the risks threatening a community. With the addition of other hazards,
    the links between the nodes (e.g., pipelines and power lines) may play a more
    critical role and thus would be needed to be modeled. Two other directions for
    further investigation would be to include more detailed fragility curves to better
    understand the vulnerability of various assets as well as to incorporate the partial
    failure of nodes due to the loss of some network components (e.g., overload of
    the power grid or insufficient pressures in the water network). These applications
    all require more detailed data, and thus the feasibility of general application
    to other case studies is variable. Nonetheless, this study demonstrates how a
    simple data set could be used to understand the cascading failures of an urban
    system. Despite the intricacy involved with cascading failures, they can provide
    critical insight into our systems and communities, both in their design and their
    vulnerabilities. Better understanding these impacts can help make more robust
    and resilient urban communities, and can play a larger role in the assessment
    and response of disruptions to our infrastructure. CRediT authorship contribution

    Appendix B. Network analysis The basis for modeling networks is through an adjacency
    matrix, which are a mathematically convenient way to represent directed and undirected
    graphs. Since the dependency in our networks is one-directional (e.g. electricity
    is flowing from the grid to the households, and water is flowing from the water
    supply to the households) and there are no closed cycles within the network, our
    system is represented by a directed acyclic graph Fig. 10. The vertices, or nodes,
    in the graph are the row index and column index (i.e. node 1 is represented by
    the first row and the first column), while edges, also called arcs or links (which
    indicate dependence), are represented by a 1 in the adjacency matrix Fig. 11.
    For each row, which represents a node, a dependent connection on another node
    is shown by placing a 1 in the column which that node is dependent on. For example,
    if node 4 is dependent on both node 1 and node 2, then there will be a 1 located
    in the adjacency matrix at row 4, column 1 as well as at row 4, column 2. Considering
    the matrix as a whole, rows indicate any dependence that node has on other nodes,
    while columns indicate any dependents that node has on it. Download : Download

    in Fig. 10. For directed acyclic graphs, only the bottom left half of the matrix
    could contain 1’s, while for undirected graphs and generic directed graphs, both
    the bottom left and the top right half could contain 1’s. A single adjacency matrix
    can represent multiple networks by simply adding additional rows and columns for
    the number of nodes in the other networks. Once the matrix is set up, calculations
    can be run to acquire the end degree, or how many dependents a particular node
    has, in order to assess the initial state of the system. To simulate a loss in
    connection, the values in the column of the node’s index can be changed to a 0,
    recording the row number of those values that were turned from a 1 to a 0. Subsequently,
    the row number of the values changed to zero in the previous step can be used
    to change the dependent connections to 0, by changing the values in that column
    number to 0. This is repeated until there are no more dependents, recording those
    that have lost service in each step. Calculations can again be run to see how
    many connections have been lost due to the particular event, again through using
    the end degree for this finalized, updated adjacency matrix. Data availability

  description: The increasing demand for water and worsening climate change place
    significant pressure on this vital resource, making its preservation a global
    priority. Water quality monitoring programs are essential for effectively managing
    this resource. Current programs rely on traditional monitoring approaches, leading
    to limitations such as low spatiotemporal resolution and high operational costs.
    Despite the adoption of novel monitoring approaches that enable better data resolution,
    the public's comprehension of water quality matters remains low, primarily due
    to communication process deficiencies. This study explores the advantages and
    challenges of using Internet of Things (IoT) and citizen science as alternative
    monitoring approaches, emphasizing the need for enhancing public communication
    of water quality data. Through a systematic review of studies implemented on-field,
    we identify and propose strategies to address five key challenges that IoT and
    citizen science monitoring approaches must overcome to mature into robust sources

    platformsWater management 1. Introduction Water, an essential resource for human
    life, faces a continuously increasing demand due to population growth and economic
    development (Ma et al., 2020). Estimates indicate that the worldwide population
    suffering from urban water scarcity can grow from 933 million in 2016 to 2.373
    billion by 2050 (He et al., 2021). Nevertheless, water demand is one of many threats
    to its availability, as low quality also renders water unsuitable for multiple
    purposes (Vliet et al., 2021). Thus, quantity and quality must be preserved to
    prevent water scarcity. International legislation, such as the European Union
    Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC), has been developed to maintain and improve
    the status of the aquatic environment and encourage sustainable water use. Furthermore,
    globally, the sixth Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of the United Nations (2022)
    aims to guarantee water and sanitation availability and sustainable management.
    Water resources management requires implementing water quality monitoring programs
    (WQMPs) to evaluate the status of water bodies (Kirschke et al., 2020). A reliable
    assessment of water quality and quantity allows decision-makers to evaluate the
    effectiveness of their management practices and government programs employed to
    preserve or improve the ecological status of a water source (Behmel et al., 2016).
    Therefore, WQMPs should be comprehensively designed, covering all aspects from
    the initial determination of monitoring objectives and the monitoring network
    design to evaluating if the information gathered is being communicated effectively
    with stakeholders and if it is helpful for decision-making (da Luz et al., 2022;
    see Fig. 1). Download : Download high-res image (394KB) Download : Download full-size

    of the monitoring objectives (e.g., public health protection, ecosystem health
    assessment, evaluation of ecological restoration projects); (2) selection of sampling
    sites to be included in the monitoring network; (3) selection of water quality
    parameters; (4) definition of sampling frequencies; (5) estimation of the required
    resources; (6) logistics planning: fieldwork, laboratory analysis, data handling,
    storage, analysis, and validation; (7) identification of communication channels;
    and (8) evaluation of information use. Developed based on Behmel et al. (2016).
    One aspect of WQMPs under constant evolution is the methods employed to evaluate
    water quality. Traditional monitoring approaches were designed to monitor well-established
    parameters (e.g., total nitrogen, total phosphorus, fecal coliforms) in specialized
    facilities, requiring trained personnel to handle sample collection and processing
    (Ahmed et al., 2019). The former results in high costs and reduced sampling frequencies,
    especially in low- and middle-income countries with limited financial resources.
    Novel technological and scientific advancements allow water quality to be monitored
    using alternative approaches that offer distinct advantages over traditional methods.
    For instance, non-target screening and effect-directed tools can be incorporated
    into WQMPs to assess emerging pollutants such as pharmaceuticals, hormones, or
    personal care products and their effects (Brack et al., 2019). Furthermore, automated
    monitoring and remote sensing allow the assessment of water quality using sensors,
    eliminating the need to deploy field personnel for sample collection. Over the
    past few decades, automated water quality monitoring (WQM) has undergone a significant
    transformation from the initial use of in situ sensors towards the adoption of
    wireless sensor network technologies (WSN), culminating in the integration of
    Internet of Things (IoT) solutions (Adu-Manu et al., 2017). Although in situ sensors
    allow real-time determination of water quality parameters, these devices do not
    permit continuous monitoring and require staff deployment. These limitations have
    led to the development of WSN technologies, allowing continuous retrieval of water
    quality data at nearly real-time speeds without human intervention (Martínez et
    al., 2020). Still, WSN technologies face high energy demands, device communication
    issues, low computational performance, reduced data storage, and high maintenance
    costs, leading to a shift towards IoT technologies (Olatinwo and Joubert, 2019).
    IoT enables the interconnection of objects, such as electronic devices and sensors,
    through the Internet (Kumar et al., 2019). This capability allows IoT devices
    to use the existing communication infrastructure and cloud computing to overcome
    WSN limitations and provide stakeholders with timely information. Additionally,
    IoT devices can incorporate software sensors for predicting water quality parameters
    based on the information from physical sensors, reducing monitoring costs (Pattnaik
    et al., 2021). In recent years, citizen science has also gained importance as
    an alternative method for collecting water quality information, involving the
    active participation of the public in monitoring activities, scientific research,
    and knowledge generation (Jollymore et al., 2017). Citizen science can potentially
    enhance data collection, observation, and dissemination (Mdee et al., 2022). Citizen-based
    WQM initiatives can provide reliable information on water bodies of diverse types
    and sizes, increasing the spatiotemporal resolution and complementing the data
    produced by scientists and government institutions at reduced costs (Hadj-Hammou
    et al., 2017; Quinlivan et al., 2020). Additionally, these initiatives can improve
    the public''s understanding of water quality and enhance current communication
    practices by increasing social involvement and awareness of water issues (Metcalfe
    et al., 2022). Due to their characteristics, IoT and citizen science have received
    interest as potential tools that can contribute to achieving different SDGs. IoT
    technologies can be applied to provide timely and accurate information about the
    quality of water resources, water usage, or wastewater management, which can contribute
    directly to SDG 6 and also towards SDG 11 by supporting the development of sustainable
    cities and communities (López-Vargas et al., 2020; Alzahrani et al., 2023). Citizen
    science initiatives focusing on water quality monitoring can potentially contribute
    towards SDG 6 by complementing the data of existing WQMPs (Fraisl et al., 2020).
    Furthermore, some citizen science projects involve collaboration among communities,
    scientists, and policymakers, aligning with SDG 17. Contrary to the high interest
    in previous monitoring approaches, scientists and practitioners have often overlooked
    the efficient communication of the information produced by WQMPs. While there
    have been significant advances in mass media in recent decades, there is little
    knowledge of the public''s communication needs regarding water quality, leading
    to water quality information often being delivered using communication channels
    that are not preferred by the public (Behmel et al., 2018). Information may be
    presented via television news when the target public expects the information to
    be delivered using interactive maps. Sometimes, WQM results are presented using
    complex language that hinders the public''s understanding (Brouwer et al., 2020).
    Hence, there is a need to evaluate the local context to identify the most appropriate
    communication channels and ways to present information to the public. Despite
    their potential benefits, IoT and citizen-based monitoring approaches have yet
    to be integrated into WQMPs due to inherent limitations that need to be addressed.
    Furthermore, unless there are substantial enhancements in water quality communication,
    implementing these monitoring approaches will merely improve the level of information
    without contributing to the public''s understanding of water quality. This systematic
    review aims to (1) identify the advantages and challenges associated with the
    use of IoT and citizen science as alternative WQM approaches, (2) provide insights
    on how to address the identified challenges for each monitoring approach, and
    (3) identify the issues hindering effective water quality communication and propose
    solutions to communicate water quality results to the public effectively. By identifying
    and proposing solutions to recurring challenges in IoT and citizen science field
    studies, we intend to inform future project designs so that these issues can be
    proactively addressed from the outset. Moreover, we seek to raise awareness about
    the inadequacies of current water quality communication practices, advocating
    for incorporating effective communication strategies into future WQM projects
    and encouraging much-needed research in this area. 2. Systematic review methodology
    The systematic review was conducted following the procedure described in Fig.
    2. The Scopus and Web of Science databases were used to identify studies from
    the last ten years that covered citizen and IoT-based WQM approaches as well as
    water quality communication. The search query used to identify keywords in the
    article title, abstract, and keywords sections was: (((automated OR IoT OR \"Internet
    of Things\") AND \"water quality monitoring\") OR \"water quality communication\"
    OR (\"water quality\" AND \"citizen science\") OR \"water quality reports\" OR
    \"water quality platform\" OR \"water quality decision support system\") AND PUBYEAR

    \"citizen science\", \"water quality reports\", \"water quality platform\", \"water
    quality decision support system\". The selection criteria were peer-reviewed research
    articles in English that focused on citizen science applied to WQM, IoT-based
    WQM, or water quality communication (WQC). The included studies for citizen science
    and IoT-based WQM were centered exclusively on surface water. However, in the
    context of WQC, the scope was extended to encompass investigations into drinking
    water due to the scarcity of available information. The excluded articles were
    those that (1) focused on remote sensing, groundwater, use of uncrewed vehicles,
    water restoration activities, or WQM in aquaculture, agriculture, water treatment
    plants, or water tanks; (2) studies that involved the monitoring or the communication
    of a single water quality parameter; (3) reviews, letters, perspectives, conference
    papers, book chapters, and books; and (4) studies that were not implemented. The
    studies that were considered as implemented were those performed in the field,
    outside laboratory-controlled conditions. In the case of IoT-based WQM, this resulted
    in the exclusion of articles that focused solely on the design of an IoT device
    or its associated algorithms without performing measurements directly in a water
    body. For citizen science, we excluded studies focused on the theoretical design
    of the project without performing its execution. Lastly, we excluded WQC studies
    that did not analyze the understanding of water quality or develop tools to enhance
    public communication. After obtaining the results from the search query, titles
    were screened to remove duplicates. A second screening that considered the title
    and abstract was then performed to remove the records that were out of the scope
    of this review. After the screening, studies were classified according to the
    publication type, and only research articles were included. The full text for
    the articles was then reviewed to assess their eligibility based on the inclusion
    and exclusion criteria described above. Subsequently, the remaining articles were
    included for analysis and classified into four categories: IoT-based WQM, citizen
    science, WQC, and mixed scope. 3. Results The initial search strategy resulted
    in 1200 articles, with 773 and 427 records identified from Scopus and Web of Science,
    respectively. Upon the initial screening of publication titles, 415 duplicates
    were identified and removed. Further screening of the title and abstract resulted
    in the exclusion of 587 records that were out of the scope of this study. Classification
    by type of study resulted in the exclusion of 104 records. Of the remaining 94
    articles, 50 met the eligibility criteria and were considered for full-text analysis.
    The included articles focus on citizen science (n = 25), IoT-based WQM (n = 14),
    and WQC (n = 9). Only two articles were identified to cover more than one of the
    previous scopes (with a mixed scope) and were analyzed within more than one category.
    The succeeding subsections provide an overview of the examined IoT, citizen science,
    and WQC studies, summarizing relevant aspects for each monitoring approach and
    the findings for communication studies. Detailed tables are provided for the reader
    to (1) assess the diversity and potential of IoT and citizen science WQM projects
    implemented on-field and (2) identify relevant research on WQC. Later, in the
    discussion section, we recover the main challenges identified in the reviewed
    studies and provide suggestions for managing these issues and enhancing the communication
    of water quality to the public. Lastly, we provide future perspectives and conclusions
    on the reviewed areas. 3.1. IoT-based water quality monitoring A total of 15 references
    (IoT n = 14, mixed scope n = 1) were reviewed on relevant aspects such as measured
    water quality parameters using physical sensors, employed microcontroller, communication
    hardware used, cloud services utilization, the method employed by the user to
    access the data, software sensors integration, device power source, country of
    implementation, monitored water body type, and data validation. The findings are

    number of measured parameters was 3.4 ± 1.1. Twelve studies measured four or fewer
    parameters to determine the water quality of a water body. The most frequently
    measured parameters were temperature, turbidity, and pH, determined in 11 studies,
    followed by dissolved oxygen and electrical conductivity, measured in seven and
    six studies, respectively. Only two studies implemented software sensors based
    on machine learning algorithms for predicting water quality parameters that cannot
    be directly measured using physical sensors. In only five studies, data was validated
    by comparing the results with those obtained following a traditional WQM approach.
    While the hardware setup varied among the monitoring devices, the preferred microcontroller
    board type was Arduino (n = 6), and the data communication was performed via a
    Wi-Fi module (n = 6). There was no clear trend regarding the preference for cloud
    service; however, most studies (n = 12) make data accessible online. Regarding
    power sources, solar panel–battery systems were employed in 47% (n = 7) of the
    devices, followed by using batteries alone in one-third (n = 5) of the monitoring
    systems. Monitoring devices were primarily employed to assess the water quality
    of rivers and lakes, respectively documented in seven and three references. Almost
    half of the reviewed studies (47%) were implemented in India (n = 4) and Malaysia
    (n = 3). The rest of the studies were implemented in China (n = 2), Italy (n =
    2), Australia (n = 1), Brunei (n = 1), Hong Kong (n = 1), and the United Kingdom
    (n = 1). 3.2. Citizen science Twenty-seven articles (citizen science n = 25, mixed
    scope n = 2) focusing on citizen science WQM were analyzed on monitoring approach,
    measured water quality parameters, periodicity of monitoring, monitored water
    body type, information communication method, country of implementation, and main
    challenges. Additional aspects that were assessed included the methods for validating
    the data collected by the volunteers, the training of the project participants,
    the collaboration with government institutions, the understanding of water quality
    by the public, and whether water quality data was reported to be accurate (Table
    2). Table 2. Summary of the reviewed citizen science-based water quality monitoring

    techniques involving the use of laboratory equipment (n = 6). Only one study employed
    IoT devices (Diviacco et al., 2021) for citizen WQM (Fig. 3A). The five most frequently
    monitored parameters were nitrate (n = 15), phosphate (n = 14), pH (n = 13), turbidity
    (n = 12), and temperature (n = 9). The analyzed articles measured 4.3 ± 1.8 parameters
    on average, whereas ten studies measured more than four parameters to determine
    water quality. The range of measured parameters varied from two to nine. Download

    More than half of the studies (n = 15) monitored water quality without a specific
    periodicity, although some followed a monthly (n = 6) or a weekly (n = 1) periodicity.
    Five studies monitored water quality on a single occasion. Nine studies monitored
    more than one water body, mostly rivers or streams (n = 16), followed by lakes
    (n = 12), ponds (n = 5), the sea (n = 2), and wetlands (n = 1). The preferred
    approach for communicating water quality results was the use of a web page or
    web platform (n = 21), and only four studies (∼15%) used more than one communication
    channel (Fig. 3B). The analyzed publications were conducted in 19 countries, with
    three studies considering more than one country. China, the United States, and
    Canada were the leading countries, with four citizen science projects implemented
    in each country. Although the authors from seven studies did not disclose the
    challenges associated with their citizen science project, 11 reported more than
    one problem. The primary reported challenges were measurement uncertainties associated
    with the monitoring methods (n = 7), issues related to citizen engagement (n =
    7), sampling bias (e.g., lower sampling of non-urban areas or certain water bodies;
    n = 7), monitoring results not used by scientists or authorities (n = 3), and
    a low number of observations (n = 3). Data validation, either statistically or
    by comparing citizen-gathered results with professional measurements, was included
    in the design of 23 of the 27 citizen science projects. Similarly, 85% (n = 23)
    of the studies reported that volunteers were trained before monitoring water quality.
    Citizen-gathered data were described as accurate in most publications (n = 17),
    with five studies depicting it as inaccurate and five not providing an explicit
    statement on data quality. Government collaboration or funding was identified
    in 15 publications. Lastly, only one article evaluated communication aspects by
    testing whether the citizen science initiative improved the participants'' understanding
    of water quality parameters (Araújo et al., 2022). 3.3. Water quality communication
    Ten studies that evaluated WQC were reviewed (WQC n = 9, mixed scope n = 1). Most
    references (70%) focused on the communication of drinking water quality. Marine
    and watershed communication was covered in two and one reference, respectively.
    Four studies assessed communication based on Customer Confidence Reports. Two
    publications focused on developing water quality indexes with visual cues that
    can be used to improve WQC. Lastly, public perception and expectations of WQC
    from a general perspective were evaluated in four references. The analyzed references
    mainly focused on WQC in North America (n = 8). A summary of the reviewed research
    is provided in Table 3. Table 3. Summary of the analyzed water quality communication

    4.1. IoT-based water quality monitoring Existing WQMPs often rely on traditional
    monitoring approaches involving manual sampling and laboratory analysis, which
    presents challenges in covering entire catchments. The former approach results
    in low sampling frequencies, which provide only a snapshot of the dynamic nature
    of water quality parameters, potentially overlooking critical events like flow
    or contaminant concentration spikes. Technological advances in sensors and communication
    technologies provide an opportunity to shift from the traditional WQM scheme towards
    automated approaches (Yanes et al., 2020). Automated monitoring allows the timely
    determination of water quality without deploying experienced field personnel to
    collect and transport samples for their analysis, facilitating high-resolution
    data collection (Meyer et al., 2019; Pasika and Gandla, 2020). Integrating cost-effective
    sensor technologies into WQMPs enables high-resolution spatiotemporal monitoring,
    paving the way for establishing causal relationships between drivers and response
    variables (Bieroza et al., 2023). This capability allows the detection of subtle
    changes in water quality conditions, which can be advantageous for identifying
    unregulated wastewater discharges into a water body (Solano et al., 2022). Using
    low-cost monitoring devices can make WQM more affordable, especially for countries
    with limited resources, opening the possibility of using the available budget
    to increase the sampling points and improve spatial coverage (Miller et al., 2023).
    This approach provides real-time insights into the entire river network, facilitating
    the identification of hotspot areas, which serve as critical starting points for
    implementing intervention measures to improve water quality (Lofton et al., 2023).
    Automated monitoring has recently focused on developing and implementing IoT-based
    WQM devices. As depicted in Fig. 4, the IoT scheme generally involves data being
    acquired, transmitted, processed, stored, and delivered (Y. Chen and Han, 2018).
    Data is acquired using sensors, generally located in situ, which measure water
    quality parameters and provide input to a controller (Geetha and Gouthami, 2017).
    The controller can then either directly send or process and send the data received
    from the sensor to an online web service using adequate communication technology.
    Cloud services can store and analyze data and apply machine learning algorithms
    to estimate water quality (Srivastava et al., 2018). Lastly, the analyzed data
    is delivered to local authorities or other users via readily available communication
    channels such as a web page, text messages, or mobile apps (Shafi et al., 2018).

    Fig. 4. Steps involved in an Internet of Things (IoT) water quality monitoring
    scheme. *Data can be directly sent or locally processed before being sent to cloud
    services. IoT provides multiple advantages besides delivering high temporal resolution
    data to end users at almost real-time speed. The costs of IoT-based monitoring
    are relatively low because it employs already existing communication infrastructure
    and cloud computing (Shi et al., 2019). The heavy computational loads can be managed
    through cloud services (e.g., ThingSpeak, ThingsBoard, or Amazon Web Services),
    requiring only a simple and low-cost processor on-field instead of an advanced
    computing device (Ray, 2016). Integration into the cloud also results in local
    devices being employed for performing simple tasks and remaining in a low power
    consumption mode. Additionally, it is possible to integrate machine learning algorithms
    into cloud servers to enhance the determination of water quality by predicting
    additional parameters or future trends based on the measurements of physical sensors
    (Alshehri et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2019). Another advantage of IoT monitoring
    devices is that they can be coupled with software sensors, which are virtual devices
    that employ mathematical models or machine learning to infer the values of water
    quality parameters without the need for physical sensors (Zainurin et al., 2022).
    The former enables the estimation of parameters that are not directly measurable
    due to the inexistence of dedicated sensors or their high cost. Multiple studies
    have discussed the development of software sensors for WQM based on the use of
    artificial neural networks (Foschi et al., 2021), random forests (Castrillo and
    García, 2020), multiple linear regression (Schilling et al., 2017), support vector
    machines (El Bilali et al., 2021), fuzzy logic systems (Zhou et al., 2022), and
    Bayesian networks ( Zhang et al., 2021). The systematic analysis revealed two
    studies incorporating software sensors into IoT devices for monitoring water bodies.
    Wang et al. (2021) employed an IoT device that gathered data from five physical
    sensors (total dissolved solids, temperature, electrical conductivity, dissolved
    oxygen, and pH) to estimate five additional parameters (nitrate-nitrogen, phosphates,
    nitrite-nitrogen, 5-day biological oxygen demand (BOD5), and ammonia-nitrogen)
    using a general regression neural network and a multivariate polynomial regression
    model. The estimations were considered adequate, with determination coefficients
    higher than 0.78. Pattnaik et al. (2021) developed an IoT device with four physical
    sensors (dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature, and turbidity) capable of determining
    BOD5 using machine learning algorithms. The system was tested on-field employing
    a K nearest-neighbor approach for BOD5 prediction, achieving a 0.92 correlation
    coefficient. Relevant examples of employing IoT devices coupled with machine learning
    to assess water quality have also been documented in other contexts, including
    water purification plants (Bhardwaj et al., 2022), wastewater treatment facilities
    (Sundui et al., 2021), and aquaculture systems (Manoharan et al., 2020). A limitation
    regarding physical sensors is that long-term in situ deployment can cause fouling,
    a phenomenon characterized by the accumulation of undesirable particles or microorganisms
    within the sensor that can produce incorrect measurements (Murray et al., 2020).
    From the analyzed references, three research articles indicated fouling problems
    with sensors on the monitoring devices. Turbidity sensors presented this problem
    in all identified studies, resulting in readings drift (Chen and Han, 2018; Trevathan
    and Schmidtke, 2022; Wong et al., 2021). Regular cleaning and calibration of the
    sensors are recommended to ensure accurate readings, with the maintenance interval
    dependent on the local environmental conditions. Devices deployed in water bodies
    with high turbidity or high concentrations of microorganisms will require shorter
    maintenance intervals to prevent fouling (Wong et al., 2021). The suggested maintenance
    interval for the devices in the reviewed studies varied between one to six months.
    Predictive maintenance algorithms can be incorporated into IoT systems to indicate
    when maintenance will be required (Sami and Khan, 2023). However, shorter intervals
    will result in a higher device maintenance cost as personnel must be deployed
    to clean the sensors. Ideally, the systems should be developed so sensors and
    other mechanical parts can be automatically cleaned without human assistance (Singh
    et al., 2022). The calibration of physical sensors must also be considered to
    maintain accurate readings. Sensor calibration was reported in 12 of the 15 reviewed
    studies, indicating the relevance of this process for gathering accurate data.
    Calibration should be performed using certified reference materials at intervals
    dependent on the specific sensor and the environmental conditions (Singh et al.,
    2022). Although sensor calibration was reported as a widespread practice, measurement
    validation was only performed on five reviewed articles, despite this process
    being essential to assess the reliability of the data. Measurement validation
    should be performed by comparing the results from the IoT device with those obtained
    by following the standardized methodologies indicated in local legislation (Martínez
    et al., 2020). IoT-based WQM devices should be designed considering the place
    of implementation. Monitoring devices must be robust and reliable to withstand
    changing environmental conditions, as deployment and maintenance may be complex,
    especially at remote locations (Xu et al., 2019). In addition to the environment,
    birds and other wildlife can interact with the devices, causing damage; therefore,
    the design and manufacturing method plays a significant role (Trevathan and Schmidtke,
    2022). Modular and reconfigurable hardware can prolong the lifespan of devices
    and diminish the expenses associated with replacing damaged or obsolete components
    (Rahmani et al., 2023). Energy efficiency is crucial for IoT devices, as replacing
    batteries requires deploying personnel, leading to increased costs. Therefore,
    employing energy-efficient components and software is essential for IoT systems,
    especially those solely reliant on battery power. Using low-power wide-area networks
    such as LoRa (Long Range Wide Area), Sigfox, or NB-IoT (Narrowband-IoT) will extend
    the interval for replacing batteries (Olatinwo and Joubert, 2019). Selecting an
    appropriate routing protocol is also relevant for optimizing energy efficiency
    in IoT devices, as these protocols determine the paths that data packets take
    through the network. Recent studies have focused on the development of energy-efficient
    protocols for IoT applications (Chithaluru et al., 2023; Narayan et al., 2023).
    Integrating energy harvesting technologies into IoT devices such as solar panels
    is recommended as they can continuously provide energy to the system, thereby
    increasing its independence capabilities (Sanislav et al., 2021). The reliance
    on external cloud services and communication technologies can hinder the implementation
    of IoT-based WQM systems. While commercial cloud services offer multiple benefits,
    the proper functioning of IoT devices relies on the continuous availability of
    these services, rendering them dependent on external entities. IoT devices relying
    on external cloud services are susceptible to increases in overall operational
    costs if companies raise their fees. Hence, when feasible, the IoT system should
    use customized cloud services based on local servers (Jan et al., 2021). Additionally,
    cloud service availability and pricing can vary depending on the country. Similarly,
    communication technologies like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and cellular networking (2G,
    3G, 4G, 5G) exhibit significant variations in accessibility and network strength
    contingent upon the geographical location (Borralho et al., 2021). Therefore,
    the selection of communication technology should consider infrastructure availability,
    volume of transmitted data, transmission frequency, transmission distance, and
    power source (Xu et al., 2019). IoT devices should also be designed to handle
    different network conditions, such as weak or intermittent signals. The constant
    connection to the Internet exposes IoT monitoring devices to cyberattacks. Vulnerabilities
    can exist in any of the layers of the IoT architecture, requiring that multiple
    security layers are implemented to protect the devices, communication channels,
    and applications that integrate the system (Kuzlu et al., 2021). Security measurements
    may include using authentication, access control, data encryption, threat and
    risk prediction, and intrusion detection (Rekha et al., 2023). Artificial Intelligence
    can be incorporated into IoT systems to enhance the detection, prevention, and
    response to anomalies or intrusions (Samriya et al., 2022; Wazid et al., 2022).
    Additionally, blockchain technology can provide an additional security layer by
    guaranteeing the traceability and immutability of the collected data (Han et al.,
    2023). Recent publications on IoT cybersecurity provide a comprehensive overview
    of the prevailing risks and state-of-the-art mitigation strategies (Sarker et
    al., 2023; Tariq et al., 2023). An aspect that remained to be addressed in the
    reviewed studies was the suitability of communication channels for delivering
    water quality results to the intended end-users. While twelve studies (80%) relied
    on online platforms accessible through smartphones or computers, three required
    data access from a local computer. The appropriateness of the selected communication
    channels depends on the end-user''s preferences and the information''s intended
    use (Behmel et al., 2018). Online platforms and instant messaging services effectively
    deliver real-time information to authorities or institutions, allowing timely
    WQM. However, diversifying communication channels is crucial when disseminating
    information directly to the public, as individuals may have varying preferences
    (DeVito, 2016). Additionally, some populations may have restricted internet access,
    limiting their ability to access water quality results. 4.2. Citizen science for
    water quality monitoring One of the critical aspects of successfully implementing
    a WQMP is sharing the generated information with the public and promoting participatory
    practices. The European Union Water Framework Directive (2014. 2000/60/EC) states
    its success “relies on close cooperation and coherent action at community, member
    state, and local level as well as on information, consultation, and involvement
    of the public, including users”. Also, SDG 6B aims to “support and strengthen
    the participation of local communities in improving water and sanitation management”.
    Participative approaches come with benefits such as raising public concern, gaining
    better acceptability of the projects, and gathering local and expert knowledge
    (Brouwer et al., 2018). Nevertheless, integrating public participation into WQMPs
    has been challenging not only because there are no clearly defined guidelines
    regarding the stage of the program in which this participation should be requested
    but also because public participation can take many forms depending on the context,
    resulting in variations in the objectives, the scope, the participants, and the
    structures at the local, regional, and national levels involved (Behmel et al.,
    2018). Despite the challenges, public participation should be considered, as the
    lack of incorporation of participatory practices can result in WQMPs that do not
    reflect the public''s information needs (Behmel et al., 2016). Within participative
    approaches, citizen science, which involves the public''s participation in scientific
    research and knowledge generation, has gained significance in recent decades (Jollymore
    et al., 2017). Citizen science is a non-traditional source of information relevant
    to achieving SDGs (Shulla et al., 2020). Traditional data sources, such as government
    ministries or institutions, currently provide the primary input of water quality
    data but face limitations such as low monitoring frequencies, and consequently,
    information becomes quickly outdated (Fritz et al., 2019). A further concern is
    that data are commonly reported on a national or regional scale, and local spatial
    variations are often overlooked (König et al., 2021). Citizen science can potentially
    improve temporal and spatial data resolution, overcoming the previous constraints
    on water quality data (San Llorente Capdevila et al., 2020). The recent interest
    in citizen science mainly derives from its multiple advantages beyond generating
    scientific knowledge, such as raising public awareness, promoting more effective
    legislation, and directing public spending towards priority areas (Fraisl et al.,
    2022). Moreover, citizen science contributes to an increase in the scientific
    literacy of the public participating in the project (Phillips et al., 2018). Citizens
    may participate in either some or multiple stages of the scientific process. These
    stages may include the formulation of the research question (Parris et al., 2023),
    co-designing of the project (Clarke et al., 2023), data collection (Moshi et al.,
    2022), data analysis (Hoyer and Canfield, 2021), and results communication (Araújo
    et al., 2022). Despite the previous advantages, implementing citizen science for
    WQM faces multiple challenges. One of the most significant concerns is the potential
    for data quality uncertainties (Burgess et al., 2017). Measurement uncertainties
    were reported to be a challenge for approximately 26% of the reviewed studies.
    Some of these uncertainties can be attributed to the nature of the methods used
    for determining water quality (Cakmak et al., 2021; Moshi et al., 2022). Testing
    kits, used in nearly 60% of the reviewed publications, are usually based on colorimetric
    methods to readily determine the values of water quality parameters such as nitrate
    and phosphate. However, participants may experience difficulties interpreting
    the test results and deciding the concentration range of a parameter based on
    the color (Quinlivan et al., 2020). While on-site probes offer the potential to
    enhance data accuracy in citizen science projects, they also present challenges.
    A study performed in Hong Kong where citizens were given a Horiba U-50 multiparameter
    water quality meter revealed that some participants found the measuring procedures
    very technical to follow, and sometimes they forgot or overlooked some minor steps
    or guidelines given to them in training (Ho et al., 2020). Similar findings were
    reported in a study conducted in Myanmar, where simple sensors outperformed a
    high-end multiparametric probe due to volunteers'' difficulty in troubleshooting
    technical issues with the equipment, resulting in data loss and periods of inactivity
    (Thatoe Nwe Win et al., 2019). Furthermore, highly specialized equipment will
    increase monitoring costs, which is only feasible for some initiatives. Previous
    findings suggest that the technology employed for citizen science WQM should be
    affordable, user-friendly, and capable of generating accurate results. IoT devices
    and smartphone-based sensors hold promise in this regard. However, the systematic
    analysis only revealed one study regarding IoT devices and another on a smartphone-based
    sensor. The IoT device, deployed on small vessels employed for leisure or fishing
    in Italy, could monitor seawater temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and
    pH and automatically transmit the collected results to a database (Diviacco et
    al., 2021). The smartphone-based device was reported in a publication where students
    determined nitrate and phosphate concentrations in a river in China (Zheng et
    al., 2022). According to their respective authors, both devices provided accurate
    data. Apart from employing different technologies, multiple approaches can increase
    data quality at different project stages. The actions include volunteer training,
    validation with experts, peer reviews, the use of standardized protocols and calibrated
    tools, and the implementation of novel statistical analysis technologies (Fritz
    et al., 2019). In this regard, 85% of the examined articles either provided participant
    training, performed water quality data validation, or did both. The degree of
    quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) varied significantly among the projects.
    While some projects relied on outlier detection alone, citizen science organizations
    like Texas Stream Team and Florida LAKEWATCH have established robust QA/QC measures
    to produce high-quality water quality data. Shared salient measures of these organizations
    include (1) on-site participant training with annual refresher sessions, (2) implementation
    of standard operating procedures for field and laboratory analysis, (3) continuous
    evaluations of data precision and accuracy, (4) and comparison studies with professional
    organizations (Albus et al., 2020; Hoyer and Canfield, 2021). Appropriate training
    can ensure that the participants have the required information to produce data
    of sufficient quality. However, mandatory training may lower participation rates
    (Peeters et al., 2022). Therefore, training needs to be dynamic, accessible, inclusive,
    and appealing to achieve a good level of commitment from volunteers (Pérez-Belmont
    et al., 2019). Training can be provided using different approaches, such as videos,
    step-by-step guides, or workshops (Shupe, 2017; George et al., 2021; Hegarty et
    al., 2021). Training may also involve testing the skills of the volunteers by
    comparing their measurements with those taken by instructors and providing customized
    feedback on how to improve measurements (Shupe, 2017) or requiring participants
    to pass a test before being able to collect water quality data (Quinlivan et al.,
    2020). In addition to the specific project training, academic institutions such
    as Cornell University and University College London currently offer citizen science
    certifications that can help improve participants’ scientific knowledge and skills.
    Standardized procedures can also improve data quality by ensuring reproducibility,
    consistency, and comparability of measurements. Standardized procedures are particularly
    relevant to enhancing the scientific community and decision-makers'' acceptance
    of the monitoring results (Brown and Williams, 2019). Citizen science projects
    can either develop their procedures or adhere to those established by other initiatives
    or organizations. Through its FreshWater Watch global project, international organizations
    such as Earthwatch Europe have established standardized measurement protocols,
    training, and quality control processes to increase the comparability of citizen-gathered
    data worldwide (Earthwatch Europe, 2023a). Another challenge, reported in 26%
    of the reviewed studies, is related to the engagement of citizen scientists. Reported
    issues include failing to recruit a sufficient number of participants (Diviacco
    et al., 2021), difficulties maintaining volunteer engagement (Biraghi et al.,
    2022; George et al., 2021; Peeters et al., 2022; Zheng et al., 2017), low levels
    of interest (Quinlivan et al., 2020), and time-consuming processes needed for
    engagement (Thornhill et al., 2018). In this regard, understanding participant
    motivations is fundamental to (1) developing tasks that align with multiple interests,
    (2) ensuring that these tasks meet participant expectations, (3) allowing for
    continuous volunteer feedback, and (4) integrating citizen scientists into co-design
    processes in the project (Fraisl et al., 2022). Motivation depends on the context,
    varies among participants, and may change over time. However, it has been reported
    that one of the citizen scientists'' main motivations is to contribute towards
    environmental preservation (Jollymore et al., 2017; Lopez, 2021; Shupe, 2017).
    Thus, communicating how their participation contributes to this goal is essential
    to prevent participants'' disappointment (Jollymore et al., 2017). Sustained participation
    will require developing projects considering participants'' interests and designating
    staff to education, communication, and engagement activities (Peeters et al.,
    2022). Establishing partnerships with organizations or academic institutions can
    also improve the project''s reach (George et al., 2021). While deficiencies in
    the project design may cause engagement issues, some contexts can be particularly
    challenging for implementing successful citizen science projects. As noted by
    Fraisl et al. (2022), in places that are affected by a high degree of social inequality,
    these initiatives may only result in the engagement of certain parts of society,
    excluding either or both citizens with low income and individuals belonging to
    underrepresented groups. In these situations, it is essential to implement strategies
    to enhance the participation of these groups. Providing economic incentives has
    proved successful in increasing and maintaining engagement (Zheng et al., 2017)
    and may be necessary to motivate the participation of low-income individuals.
    Spatial or geographical sampling bias is another concern observed in 26% of the
    reviewed citizen science projects. Sampling bias can be attributed to the project
    design as it mainly arises when volunteers are not assigned to monitor specific
    sampling locations. When participants are invited to self-select sampling locations,
    they often choose easily accessible areas or places of local interest (Bishop
    et al., 2020; Hegarty et al., 2021). This leads to more observations closer to
    urban centers and road networks. Volunteers may also prefer to monitor visually
    appealing sites, such as ponds in parks, over less scenic sites (McGoff et al.,
    2017). Additionally, a higher participation of city volunteers can lead to an
    overrepresentation of urban areas and an underrepresentation of rural regions
    (Biraghi et al., 2022). Project design can also lead to temporal bias or fewer
    observations. For instance, only 26% of the reviewed studies had a determined
    periodicity. When periodicity is not defined, volunteers may monitor water quality
    during their spare time, leading to more observations produced during weekends.
    In other cases, observations can be produced randomly upon finding polluted water
    (Zheng et al., 2017). Additionally, some projects integrate public events into
    their regular monitoring activities (e.g., monitoring campaigns with schools),
    resulting in a temporal increase in observations during the event (Biraghi et
    al., 2022). Geographical and temporal sampling biases are not entirely negative.
    Highly engaged individuals who frequently monitor a particular site are more likely
    to encounter abnormal events that can be undetected when using a higher spatial
    distribution approach (Jollymore et al., 2017). Furthermore, monitoring small
    local water bodies such as ponds, small streams, or ditches is valuable, as these
    water bodies are often overlooked by national and international legislation (McGoff
    et al., 2017; Thornhill et al., 2018). Lastly, it is relevant to consider that
    even though citizen science can increase spatiotemporal coverage and complement
    official databases in some instances, it is not designed to assume complete responsibility
    for WQM (Cakmak et al., 2021). Geographical and temporal sampling biases can be
    minimized through careful project design, collaboration with experts, and strategic
    sampling approaches. Defining specific sampling locations or constraining sampling
    areas can significantly reduce spatial bias while establishing a defined monitoring
    periodicity can address temporal bias. However, establishing spatial or temporal
    constraints results in a lower level of participation and, consequently, fewer
    observations (Jollymore et al., 2017; McKinley et al., 2017). The requirement
    to designate precise monitoring sites or sampling frequencies will ultimately
    be contingent on the project goals and should consider the repercussions for public
    involvement. When the project objective is to fill temporal gaps of an existing
    WQMP or validate data quality, monitoring points should match those used by professionals,
    as variations in sampling locations may impact the level of agreement between
    both datasets (Albus et al., 2020). Conversely, if the goal is to increase the
    spatial coverage or resolution of a WQMP, project leaders must select distinct
    monitoring points from those already monitored by professionals. Citizen initiatives
    should collaborate with government and academic institutions when establishing
    monitoring points and frequencies to maximize the value of the produced information.
    Coordination among stakeholders can facilitate the achievement of shared monitoring
    goals by distributing the efforts and necessary expenditures (Gradilla-Hernández
    et al., 2022). Securing participation when specific sampling locations and periodicity
    are essential can be challenging. However, some projects have obtained good results
    by integrating WQM into school activities or the participants'' work. Araújo et
    al. (2022) incorporated middle school students into a citizen science WQM project
    to promote chemistry learning. In this initiative, teachers considered the participation
    of students in the project and designed the school year schedule to allow some
    of the project tasks to be completed during school hours, hence facilitating the
    project implementation. Another initiative involving a collaboration between the
    financial organization HSBC and Earthwatch promoted the participation of volunteer
    employees from HSBC by considering the project as part of their jobs (Pérez-Belmont
    et al., 2019). Nevertheless, applying the previous approaches in all contexts
    may not be feasible, requiring the project engagement strategies to be adapted
    to meet monitoring requirements. Though explicitly mentioned in only three studies,
    the underutilization of the results from citizen science studies on WQMP remains
    a critical issue demanding attention. This underutilization may stem from the
    perception that citizen-generated data is less reliable than the information produced
    by professional scientists. However, research has shown that citizens can provide
    valuable and reliable contributions of similar quality to those produced by professionals
    when adequate training, procedures, and methods are provided (Kosmala et al.,
    2016). Citizen science programs such as Texas Stream Team and Florida LAKEWATCH
    have relevant QA/QC protocols to comply with United States federal standards and
    have been producing high-quality information for decades, yet much of the information
    has remained underutilized (Albus et al., 2020; Hoyer and Canfield, 2021). Carlson
    and Cohen (2018) explored the relationships between citizen water monitoring and
    water initiatives led by the Canadian government. Their findings indicate that
    even though citizen organizations followed standardized monitoring protocols,
    less than half of them stated that their data is being used to inform government
    water policy. Furthermore, more cooperation was observed among citizen monitoring
    organizations than between citizen organizations and the government. The scientific
    value underestimation of citizens'' data and the lack of effective communication
    must be assessed for the effective valorization of citizen science. Establishing
    partnerships among government agencies, scientific institutions, and citizen science
    groups is essential to designing and successfully implementing projects that fulfill
    shared requirements and achieve mutual goals (Agarwal et al., 2023). A topic that
    did not receive the required attention in the reviewed articles was evaluating
    the communication process in citizen science initiatives. None of the studies
    evaluated whether the general population understood their published results. Only
    one study tested whether participants understood water quality parameters better
    after the citizen science project (Araújo et al., 2022). Evaluating participants''
    understanding of the data they collected and its use is relevant for maintaining
    engagement (Lopez, 2021). In some initiatives, the transfer of information can
    be unidirectional from scientists to citizens or from more experienced participants
    to newly incorporated ones. The absence of a reciprocal knowledge exchange hinders
    the effective integration of contextual, traditional, and local knowledge, often
    recognized as valuable but surprisingly absent in many documented citizen science
    implementations (Jollymore et al., 2017). Lastly, it is essential to consider
    the channels used to communicate citizen-collected data. Most of the reviewed
    studies (∼78%) used either a website or a web-based platform to publish their
    results, followed by smartphone apps (∼11%) or social media (∼7%). While the public
    may prefer these channels in some contexts, communication strategies should be
    specifically designed for the place of implementation of citizen science projects.
    Communication channels dependent on the Internet may be unsuitable in places with
    limited access to this technology as they can exclude a significant part of the
    population. Moreover, only four reviewed studies indicated using multiple communication
    channels (Biraghi et al., 2022; George et al., 2021; Hegarty et al., 2021; H.
    Zheng et al., 2017). As discussed in the next section, employing multiple communication
    channels is needed to increase the likelihood that the information reaches the
    population, as some individuals may prefer one channel over another. Incorporating
    technological tools such as web-based platforms and mobile applications into WQM
    has multiple advantages, as these technologies can also be employed for data collection.
    Both tools can provide participants with a user-friendly interface to improve
    their understanding of the monitored ecosystem. Additionally, they can increase
    data quality as measurements can be georeferenced and timestamped before being
    captured into a server (Biraghi et al., 2022; George et al., 2021). These applications
    should be able to function offline to capture information in remote rural areas
    with low or non-existent internet connectivity (Cakmak et al., 2021). However,
    centering the project around these tools may decrease participation in contexts
    with reduced technological accessibility, requiring a mixed approach in which
    printed materials are used (US General Services Administration, 2023). Communication
    of citizen-collected data can be further improved by increasing the visibility
    of the initiative. Visibility can be enhanced through collaboration with widely
    recognized organizations or government agencies, allowing participants to use
    existing communication platforms to disseminate their findings to the public.
    Multiple citizen science initiatives publish their results in Earthwatch Europe''s
    FreshWater Watch web platform, making their results available to people worldwide
    (Earthwatch Europe, 2023b). However, data quality concerns continue to hinder
    citizen science data communication by government institutions (de Sherbinin et
    al., 2021). Citizen scientists should collaborate closely with government agencies
    and the scientific community to establish consensus protocols and the quality
    standards needed to enable their data to be reported alongside official data (Fritz
    et al., 2019). 4.3. Water quality communication WQC, like any other form of communication,
    should follow a process. In general terms, communication is a two-way process
    in which a sender encodes a message that is transmitted through one or more channels
    to a receiver which decodes and interprets the message; where message interpretation
    is influenced by the context and can be affected by noise (DeVito, 2016). Effective
    communication involves clear messages being delivered using appropriate platforms,
    designed to target diverse audiences, and shared by trusted individuals (Hyland-Wood
    et al., 2021). Efficient communication is essential when sharing the results of
    WQMPs, as these are the indicators stakeholders use to evaluate the efficiency
    of management strategies (Behmel et al., 2018). One of the main challenges affecting
    WQC is the low message clarity produced by the complex coding of information.
    This issue has been identified in Customer Confidence Reports (CCR), which are
    water quality reports that community water systems or water utilities must provide
    each year to citizens in the United States. These reports contain information
    about the water source, regulated contaminants found in water, and potential health
    effects associated with those contaminants (US EPA, 2023a). Studies evaluating
    CCR readability have consistently found that these reports are difficult to read,
    requiring a specialized reading level. For instance, Nicholas and Vedachalam (2021)
    assessed the readability of 243 CCR distributed across the United States in 2020
    using the Flesch Reading Ease Score (FRES), a tool widely employed to measure
    the complexity of a document and the difficulty of reading it. The FRES returns
    a value of 0 if the text is practically unreadable and 100 if it is easy to read
    (Flesch, 1948). The average CCR readability was 7.46, indicating that the documents
    require the reading level of a university graduate. Similar results were previously
    observed by Roy et al. (2015), who evaluated 30 CCR issued from 2011 to 2013 and
    found an average FRES of 36.35, corresponding to a university reading level. Providing
    the public with water quality information with a complexity like that found in
    university-level reading materials could create barriers for a substantial portion
    of the population. For instance, 48% of individuals aged 25 to 34 in OECD countries
    held a university degree or higher qualifications in 2021(OECD, 2022). This suggests
    that nearly half of the population within that age group may face challenges understanding
    CCR. Furthermore, comparing both studies shows that the readability ease of CCR
    has not increased in more than seven years, indicating that the topic has not
    received sufficient attention. Hence, the public keeps receiving information that
    can only be adequately interpreted by some individuals rather than being accessible
    to all citizens. Phetxumphou et al. (2015) evaluated the clarity of message communication
    of United States CCR by using the CDC''s Clear Communication Index, a tool created
    to develop and assess public communication materials. This index evaluates the
    material in seven different areas using 20 items to provide an overall score from
    0 to 100, where 100 represents complete clarity and 90 or higher is a passing
    score (CDC, 2019). All the assessed CCR obtained scores lower than the passing
    score, and the overall score across CCR was 50 ± 14. Based on the results, the
    authors concluded that a large proportion of the public will probably not understand
    the message provided by the CCR, and hence, they will not know the degree to which
    local water is safe to drink. Considering the preceding findings, an effort must
    be made to improve the clarity of water quality information. The public requires
    aid in interpreting water quality data to understand the risks of deviations in
    a particular parameter and the overall risks associated with using their water
    (Brouwer et al., 2020). Additionally, citizens must understand the available information
    to assess whether the designated authorities manage their water efficiently. The
    comprehension of water quality empowers citizens to instigate interventions from
    authorities as needed. The overall clarity of the transmitted information can
    be enhanced by implementing clear communication guidelines in water quality reports,
    such as the CDC''s Clear Communication Index. According to some recommendations
    of the CDC''s Clear Communication Index, documents should (1) contain one main
    message statement located at the beginning of the material and emphasized with
    visual cues (e.g., bolds, font size, color) to draw the attention from the reader;
    (2) have images or graphs that support the main message; (3) include one or more
    calls to action for the audience even when the purpose is to inform; (4) use active
    voice and words that are understood by the audience; (5) present information in
    an organized way using headings and lists when needed; (6) provide authoritative
    sources of information and recognize uncertainty; (7) present numbers that the
    main audience uses (avoid using scientific notation or very large or small numbers
    by adjusting measurement unit scale); (8) always explain what the numbers mean;
    and (9) present and explain associated risks (CDC, 2019). Another strategy to
    increase message clarity when presenting water quality information to the public
    is developing communication tools such as water quality indices (Ewaid et al.,
    2020; Woodward et al., 2021). These indices generally summarize water quality
    into a single number, allowing non-experts to quickly understand the status of
    water without the need to review each monitored parameter separately and try to
    interpret the units in which results are presented (Casillas-García et al., 2021;
    Fernández del Castillo et al., 2022). Indices are often used to report the water
    quality of water bodies and can serve as tools for stakeholders to evaluate the
    government''s management of a water source once the results of a WQMP are obtained
    (Kachroud et al., 2019). While a single index can provide a general overview,
    employing multiple indices tailored to specific aspects of water quality, such
    as heavy metal or microbiological contamination, can offer more detailed insights
    into the types of pollution present (Haghnazar et al., 2022; Karaouzas et al.,
    2021). Visual aids such as color-coded scales can further enhance the public''s
    understanding of these indices (Cham et al., 2020). One innovative approach is
    a graphical index developed by Sakai et al. (2018) that visualizes water quality
    using a heart shape, where a perfect heart represents clean water, and a fragmented
    heart indicates pollution. This index is expected to raise public awareness of
    water quality issues and facilitate community engagement. However, further research
    is needed to evaluate its effectiveness. A second issue with WQC concerns the
    selection of communication channels for message delivery. Dunn et al. (2014) identified
    that despite water quality information being reported annually by water suppliers
    in British Columbia, the public often remains unaware of its existence or does
    not know where to find it. Another study by Ochoo et al. (2017) in Newfoundland
    found a disconnection between public perception and actual water quality, suggesting
    that information was not disseminated appropriately. Prior research indicates
    that the mere publication of information is inadequate; it is imperative to ascertain
    the favored communication channels within each social context and tailor communication
    strategies accordingly. Behmel et al. (2018) performed a study to identify the
    knowledge needs, concerns, and preferred modes of communication on water quality
    and quantity from the public of two distinct watersheds in Quebec. Researchers
    found that the communication channel preferences diverged among the population
    and changed between watersheds. Citizens of the first watershed mostly preferred
    interactive maps, followed by municipal websites and notice boards. Citizens from
    the second watershed preferred interactive maps, followed by municipal websites
    and social media sites. The least preferred communication channels were special
    bulletins and television news for the first watershed and scientific papers and
    television news for the second watershed. Similarly, a study performed by Brouwer
    et al. (2020) in the Netherlands found that most citizens preferred water quality
    data to be offered via a website and that data were presented in different layers,
    allowing interested individuals to navigate from a general water quality summary
    to information about each parameter. Previous studies have shown that the public
    prefers to access information online through digital platforms. These platforms
    are valuable for achieving effective communication because they allow the information
    to be displayed interactively and using visual aids, which can be advantageous
    when communicating a topic such as water quality, where usually multiple parameters
    are reported simultaneously (Cham et al., 2020). Platforms may allow users to
    summarize data using charts, review data in a georeferenced way, or perform statistical
    analyses. Additionally, online platforms can communicate water quality indices
    alongside parameters to enhance the public''s comprehension of water quality.
    Table 4 provides examples of platforms that communicate water quality to the public
    at different spatial levels. Table 4. Examples of digital platforms for water
    quality communication. Platform name Level Purpose Reference State of Bathing
    Waters International Provide information about coastal and inland bathing water
    locations and their quality within the European Union. European Environment Agency
    (2022) National Water Dashboard National Provide real-time stream, lake, and reservoirs,
    precipitation, and groundwater information from United States Geological Survey
    observation stations across the country. (U.S. Geological Survey, 2023) LAWA River

    points throughout New Zealand. (Land, 2023) Protecting Florida Together Water

    that are relevant to water quality issues. (Protecting Florida Together, 2023)
    Chesapeake Bay Watershed Data Dashboard Watershed Consolidate and provide accessibility
    within a single platform to information that can be used to guide watershed restoration
    efforts. (Lower Mississippi-Gulf Water Science Center, 2019) Decision support
    systems (DSS) can also be implemented within a digital platform. These systems
    aim to assist decision-making by harnessing data from different sources to provide
    objective advice and background support on solving complex problems (Zhai et al.,
    2020). DSS can also serve as a mechanism for transparency, as users can replicate
    the decision procedure and assess the decisions regarding feasibility, strength,
    and robustness (McIntosh et al., 2011). However, as discussed by Walling and Vaneeckhaute
    (2020), the effective implementation of DSS remains complex as there are challenges
    associated with (1) stakeholders’ participation, identification, and fulfillment
    of their expectations; (2) the selection and implementation of the models within
    the system; and (3) the system design in terms of the user interaction to obtain
    relevant results. Digital platforms can also be used to promote public engagement.
    Public engagement in government affairs can take multiple forms, ranging from
    only requesting feedback on the published information to seeking a sustained dialog
    to achieve consensual solutions to significant challenges (Bertot et al., 2010).
    Digital platforms can serve to fulfill both purposes. Platforms should not only
    function as channels to convey the status of a water body but also as systems
    that welcome and disseminate water quality data gathered by citizens, as well
    as proposals aimed at enhancing water quality and its communication. However,
    it is essential to consider that WQC should use more than just a single channel
    to reach the public because there are population groups that may not be interested
    in using digital platforms, do not have access to them, or prefer other communication
    channels. Therefore, it is vital to identify the preferred channels in the geographical
    context where water quality is being communicated and adapt the communication
    strategy to employ multiple channels (e.g., social media, newspapers, notice boards)
    to reach most of the population. Lastly, a third issue with WQC is the lack of
    bi-directionality or feedback. Evans and Carpenter (2019) studied how water utilities
    evaluate the effectiveness of CCR in terms of consumer understanding, engagement,
    and shaping water quality perceptions. The authors found that from 238 water utilities
    distributed across the United States, about 55% did not track consumer engagement
    or understanding of the CCR, 68% did not monitor consumer perceptions about water
    quality, and 46% did not use any methods to understand what information the public
    would like in their reports. Previous data emphasizes the need for incorporating
    mechanisms to receive or gather public feedback. Surveys or follow-up calls can
    be employed to evaluate public perceptions and their needs in terms of communication.
    A two-way communication is essential to evaluate the effectiveness of WQC and
    prevent misconceptions about water quality. Receiving feedback from the public
    is valuable as it can help institutions improve the readability, clarity, understandability,
    and accuracy of water quality communications (Evans and Carpenter, 2019). Government
    institutions such as the United States Environmental Protection and the US EPA,
    2023b and state-level environmental agencies allow public involvement by accepting
    public comments, organizing public meetings and webinars when proposing regulations,
    or accepting public reports of environmental violations. However, there is still
    a need to establish and evaluate the efficacy of mechanisms aimed at constantly
    receiving feedback from the public on how to enhance WQC. Fischer et al. (2022)
    suggested that to facilitate communication bidirectionality, scientists and communicators
    should train key agents to become citizen scientists who can communicate water
    quality to the public. Central agents can include political leaders, religious
    leaders, educators, or government officials, who can contribute to distributing
    information through different channels such as word of mouth or social media.
    Nevertheless, as discussed in the preceding subsection, citizen science WQM initiatives
    still require the integration of mechanisms to identify the communication channels
    preferred by the public and to monitor their comprehension of the transmitted
    water quality information. Integrating the former mechanisms and clear communication
    tools within these initiatives can transform them into a more valuable channel
    for WQC. 5. Future perspectives While IoT and citizen science offer valuable alternatives
    for monitoring water quality, these approaches must address certain limitations
    to establish themselves as robust sources of water quality information. The reviewed
    literature concerning the implementation of IoT-based WQM devices underscores
    the necessity for (1) increasing their robustness to withstand changing environmental
    conditions, (2) solving the need for regular cleaning and calibration of the sensors
    to prevent fouling and ensure accurate readings, (3) increasing the energy efficiency
    of their components and reliability of their power sources, (4) ensuring the continuous
    provision of cloud services, and (5) implementing robust security measures to
    safeguard against data breaches and cyberattacks and guarantee data traceability.
    Further advancements in the IoT technologies focused on WQM will allow the development
    of more robust devices at reduced costs, promoting the incorporation of IoT into
    WQMPs. Citizen science projects must surmount obstacles like (1) minimizing measurement
    uncertainties, (2) sustaining citizen engagement, (3) reducing sampling bias,
    (4) increasing the number of observations and collected data, and (5) establishing
    trust among scientists and authorities. Citizen initiatives should continue incorporating
    and improving their mechanisms to guarantee data quality. Projects should be designed
    considering that each context is different and constantly changing; thus, the
    initiative should have sufficient flexibility to adapt to changes in participant
    interests to maintain engagement. Citizen science initiatives should collaborate
    with governments and academic institutions to build and execute projects that
    meet shared objectives. These partnerships will play a pivotal role in elevating
    their public visibility, expanding avenues for funding, and shifting the prevailing
    perception of limited data reliability. In addition to preceding concerns, future
    citizen science and IoT projects should evaluate if their communication channels
    suit their intended end-users, especially when aiming to communicate with the
    public. Mechanisms to evaluate the effectiveness of WQC should be incorporated
    into the design of IoT and citizen science initiatives. Without integrating these
    mechanisms, the former monitoring approaches will continue to increase the amount
    of water quality data but not the public understanding of water bodies. While
    we did not analyze data-sharing practices among different users in this study,
    we encourage the adoption of FAIR principles (findability, accessibility, interoperability,
    and reusability) to facilitate the appropriate sharing of data generated by these
    projects among stakeholders (Wilkinson et al., 2016). Although multiple IoT and
    citizen science WQM projects have been reviewed, the extent of this study did
    not encompass citizen science and IoT implementations focused on using technologies
    like remote sensing or uncrewed vehicles, nor WQM projects focusing on groundwater,
    aquaculture, and agriculture. Therefore, further studies on the former applications
    are needed, which could offer valuable insights into common challenges and potential
    solutions. Similarly, this work considered only peer-reviewed publications, excluding
    project reports, websites, and non-academic works from which practical conclusions
    can be obtained, especially regarding citizen science and WQC. Lastly, addressing
    the shortcomings of current water quality communication practices requires the
    implementation of strategies that (1) enhance message clarity, (2) align communication
    channels with public preferences, and (3) foster bidirectional communication.
    Well-established guidelines such as the CDC''s Clear Communication Index can be
    employed to make the information accessible to a wide range of audiences. Tools
    like water quality indices should be employed to facilitate water quality understanding.
    The choice of communication channels should be informed by research on public
    preferences within each context. Multiple channels are required to guarantee more
    extensive outreach across diverse audience segments. Additionally, communicators
    should be open to receiving feedback and incorporate mechanisms to promote public
    participation in water quality affairs. Enhancing the comprehension of water quality
    will enable citizens to evaluate the impact of their actions and the effectiveness
    of management practices implemented by authorities in safeguarding our invaluable
    water resources. A summary of the key challenges and recommendations is provided
    in Table 5. Table 5. Identified challenges and suggestions for IoT, citizen science,

    alternatives for WQM, providing supplementary data that can address the spatiotemporal
    limitations of existing WQMPs relying on conventional monitoring methods. IoT
    delivers timely water quality information with high temporal resolution, allowing
    for enhanced environmental surveillance. Citizen science enhances public awareness
    and understanding of water quality while closing spatiotemporal monitoring gaps
    through data collected by regular citizens. However, both fields face challenges
    that need to be addressed. IoT WQM devices need improved robustness, power efficiency,
    data security, cloud services, and sensor cleaning and calibration methods. Citizen
    science projects must minimize measurement uncertainties, reduce sampling biases,
    increase the collected data, sustain participant engagement, and establish trust
    relationships with scientists and policymakers. Furthermore, scientists and practitioners
    need to focus on improving water quality communication with the public and develop
    projects integrating this aspect into their design. CRediT authorship contribution

    discussed, highlighting suggested evaluation metrics and providing a comprehensive
    analysis of the state-of-the-art optimization methods to assess model accuracy.
    This review targets researchers in limnology, hydrology, ecology, biology, physics,
    engineering, and remote sensing from the private and public sectors interested
    in lake water temperature modeling and its applications. 1 Introduction Lakes
    are a major component of the hydrosphere which are able to accumulate and transfer
    energy and matter to and from other spheres of the environment. Lakes, especially
    the largest ones, have higher thermal inertia and longer residence times than
    those of other inland water bodies such as rivers and lagoons, and thus they act
    as buffers in the inland waters transport network. As such, they play an important
    role in the global water cycle and in regulating biodiversity, the availability
    and quality of water resources, and the provision of ecosystem services. In many
    regions of the world, lakes are of key significance in purely environmental terms,
    and also through their relevance for human life and socioeconomic activities.
    Human activities contribute to the ongoing alteration of the quality of inland
    water bodies. For example, over-exploitation of water resources causes the progressive,
    and sometimes abrupt, shrinking of lakes. This is an emergent issue especially
    in drylands (Klein et al., 2014; H. Liu et al., 2019) that leads to, for example,
    the disappearing of the Aral Sea. A decrease in lake water storage across the
    globe is also an effect of climate change (E. A. Webb & Liljedahl, 2023; F. Yao
    et al., 2023; G. Zhao et al., 2022), which has motivated a growing need for models
    that predict lake water levels (Ozdemir et al., 2023). Recent studies have suggested
    a rapid and abrupt change in water temperature, ice cover, water quality, and
    hydrobiological conditions in lakes worldwide, with clear regime shifts observed
    in some cases (North et al., 2013; Tan et al., 2018; Van Cleave et al., 2014;
    W. Wang et al., 2023; Woolway, Kraemer, et al., 2020), driven by climate change.
    Specifically, changes in meteorological conditions (e.g., air temperature) are
    the most closely associated with those observed in lakes. Based on lake model
    projections, the anticipated evolution of climate change under various Representative
    Concentration Pathways (RCPs) suggests that the current trajectory will persist
    in the coming decades. This is true when considering the most optimistic future
    emission scenarios (e.g., RCP2.6), and it can be even worse under moderate to
    severe future emission scenarios (e.g., RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) (Golub et al., 2022;
    Kraemer et al., 2021; Maberly et al., 2020; Merz et al., 2023; Piccolroaz, Zhu,
    et al., 2021; Woolway, 2023; Woolway, Jennings, et al., 2021). Shifts in lake
    thermal regimes can have extensive and potentially profound impacts on lake ecosystems.
    Shorter winters (e.g., ice cover) and an earlier onset and strengthening of summer
    stratification are projected to occur this century (see e.g., Anderson et al.,
    2021; Fenocchi et al., 2018; Mullin et al., 2020; Piccolroaz, Zhu, et al., 2021;
    Shatwell et al., 2019; Woolway, Sharma, et al., 2021; Xue et al., 2022). These
    are expected to be accompanied by a reduction of lake turnovers and eventual mixing
    regime shifts (Shatwell et al., 2019; Woolway & Merchant, 2019; Wood et al., 2023),
    which can generate complex physical, chemical, and biological feedback mechanisms
    and modify the lake ecosystem functioning (Mesman et al., 2021). Deep mixing in
    lakes is crucial for redistributing nutrients throughout the water column, maintaining
    oxygen levels in deep layers and preventing a deoxygenation of bottom waters which
    pose a threat to aquatic fauna and can facilitate the release of phosphorus from
    lake sediments (Hupfer & Lewandowski, 2008). The progressive warming, depletion
    of dissolved oxygen, and increase of nutrient concentrations in deep layers have
    already been observed in numerous lakes worldwide. In many cases, these factors
    occur simultaneously, posing significant challenges to lake ecosystems (see e.g.,
    Jane et al., 2023; Kong et al., 2023; North et al., 2014; Rempfer et al., 2010;
    Straile et al., 2003) and highlighting the importance of conducting further research
    in the field of lake thermal dynamics and regimes. Water temperature is one of
    the most commonly used indicators to assess the impact of climate change on the
    physical and ecological functioning of lakes. Indeed, water temperature is one
    of the most widely monitored physical characteristic of lakes. Most lake temperature
    records start during the second half of the 20th century or in the 21st century,
    although for some lakes regular measurements of water temperatures are available
    for even a longer period (see e.g., some Austrian lakes, Dokulil et al., 2006;
    Livingstone & Dokulil, 2001; some lakes in the English Lake District, Feuchtmayr
    et al., 2012; Lake Peipsi in Estonia/Russia, Kangur et al., 2020, 2021; Lake Mendota
    in the USA Robertson, 2016; see also Pilla et al., 2021). The relatively large
    availability of lake water temperature observations is due to both (a) the relative
    ease and affordability of acquiring this type of measurement and (b) the central
    role of water temperature in controlling most of the physical and bio-chemical
    processes in a lake (Mollema & Antonellini, 2016; Woolway, Kraemer, et al., 2020).
    It is sufficient to cite that water temperature is at the basis of the classification
    of lakes'' mixing regimes starting from the seminal contribution by Hutchinson
    and Löffler (1956) and its revised version by (W. M. Lewis, 1983) until more recent
    classifications (Kirillin & Shatwell, 2016; Yang et al., 2021). As such, water
    temperature is increasingly used as one of the main indicators to quantify and
    communicate the impact of climate change on inland water bodies. Technological
    advancements have made temperature monitoring more efficient and accurate through
    (a) increasing availability of remote sensing data starting from the 1980s and
    their use for lakes (Carrea, Crétaux, et al., 2022; Layden et al., 2015; Merchant
    & MacCallum, 2018; Schneider & Hook, 2010; Schneider et al., 2019), with improving
    sensors (higher stability, better traceability chain (Smith et al., 2021), and
    finer spatial/temporal resolution) and refined retrieval techniques tracking uncertainties
    from the thermal noise of the instrument to the uncertainty in the retrieval (Carrea,
    Crétaux, et al., 2023), (b) easier access to low-cost sensors that promoted the
    building of self-made systems for in situ monitoring (Demetillo et al., 2019;
    Marcé et al., 2016), and (c) general improvement of the sensors'' performance
    and accuracy (Sommer et al., 2013; Van Haren et al., 2001). Parallel to this,
    new types of instruments have been produced and are increasingly used as for example,
    turbulence microprofilers (Piccolroaz, Fernández-Castro, et al., 2021; Sepúlveda
    Steiner et al., 2021), autonomous profilers (Rainville & Pinkel, 2001; Ward et
    al., 2014), underwater gliders (Austin, 2013; Sepúlveda Steiner et al., 2023)
    and fiber-optics (Duraibabu et al., 2017; Selker et al., 2006), thus allowing
    a larger spectrum of possible monitoring applications. Accordingly, lake water
    temperature data are of different types, in terms of measurement technique (in
    situ sampling vs. remote sensing), temporal resolution (periodic or spot samplings
    data vs. continuous data) and spatial coverage (point data vs. maps passing through
    profiles and transects). Exploring the dynamics of water temperature is highly
    beneficial for understanding past and current states of lakes and forecasting
    the possible trajectories lakes may take in the future. Mathematical models play
    a crucial and powerful role in projecting the impact of climate change on future
    lake mixing and thermal dynamics. Thanks to the increasing availability of data
    and progress in computational technology, the limnological community contributed
    to the development and application of a number of water temperature models. Figure
    1a reports the number of scientific publications from 1960 to 2022 containing
    the term “lake*” (L) and those containing also the terms “model*” or “simulation”
    (L + M) in title, abstract and keywords (* being a truncation wildcard operator;
    right y-axis). Among the latter group we identified those also containing the
    terms “temperature” (L + M + T, bars in the left y-axis) and “climate change”
    or “climatic change” (L + M + T + CC, inner bars in the left y-axis). The scientific
    production was limited before the 1960s, after which it underwent an exponential
    trend with a marked increase after mid of 2000s. The fraction of lake studies
    (L) containing the search words “model*” or “simulation” (L + M) shows a clear
    boost in the early 1970s, consistent with the introduction of the personal computer
    and the progress in high-performance scientific computing, followed by a steady
    increase (Figure 1b). In 2022 about one third of L studies included the terms
    “model*” or “simulation”. A similar trend has been observed in the closely related
    field of integrated water resource assessment and modeling, as reported by Zare
    et al. (2017). The fraction of L + M studies containing the search word “temperature”
    (L + M + T) was constantly around 15% (Figure 1c), with a small decline down to
    ∼10% around 1980s followed by a steady increase up to 20% in the last decade.
    The publications that also contain the search terms “climate change” or “climatic
    change” (L + M + T + CC) first appeared in 1987 and become more widespread after
    the 1990s, consistent with the timeline of climate change mitigation and adaptation
    summits (Figure 1a). Since then, the percentage of these studies relative to the
    lake temperature modeling studies (L + M + T) has been steadily increased up to
    more than 20% in recent years (Figure 1d). Figure 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    (a) Number of articles published per year from 1960 to 2022 containing the term
    “lake*” (L) or the terms “lake*” (L) and “model*” or “simulation” (M) in title,
    abstract and keywords, with a specific focus on those also containing the terms
    “temperature” (T) and “climate change” or “climatic change” (CC). The milestones
    in climate change mitigation and adaptation summits are also reported, including
    the establishment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the
    United Nations (UN) Earth Summit, and various climate protocols and agreements.
    The percentages of articles dealing with modeling (L + M) relative to all lake
    studies (L), modeling lake temperature (L + M + T) relative to all lake modeling
    studies (L + M), and lake temperature modeling and climate change (L + M + T +
    CC) relative to all the lake temperature modeling studies (L + M + T) is also
    reported in subplots (b), (c), and (d). Source: Scopus, 19 April 2023. The available
    modeling studies span a wide range of applications (see e.g., T. Jia et al. (2022)
    for a recent review) from the hindcast of historical lake water temperature conditions
    (Hegerl et al., 2018; Piccolroaz et al., 2020) to the forecast of lake water temperature
    over seasonal (Mercado-Bettín et al., 2021) to climatological time scales (Golub
    et al., 2022). Indeed, depending on the type of model, water temperature simulations
    can cover different extents (local vs. global lakes), refer to different temporal
    scales (from daily to climatological time scales) and account for various spatial
    dimensions (from zero-dimensional lake surface water temperature (LSWT) models
    to fully three-dimensional hydro-thermodynamic models). In this contribution,
    we review lake water temperature models, and summarize their advantages and limitations
    and the data sources required to drive them. Here, we distinguish between (a)
    models used to predict LSWT, which is increasingly used as an indicator of global
    warming, and (b) models to reproduce the vertical distribution of lake water temperature
    that describe vertical stratification and mixing, with a particular focus on one-dimensional
    (1D) models. In Section 2, we discuss the physics regulating thermal dynamics
    in lakes as a primer for the description of physical or process-based models.
    In Section 3, we provide an overview of the different sources of observational
    water temperature data used in the field of lake water temperature modeling. The
    classification and a detailed review of the water temperature models available
    in the literature is provided in Section 6. Model performance and optimization
    methods are discussed in Section 18, whereas emerging modeling approaches are
    examined in Section 21. Finally, the main conclusions are drawn in Section 28.
    2 Heat Budget and Thermodynamics of Lakes Any change in lake water temperature
    is determined by the imbalance in heat gains and losses of the lake, that is,
    by the net heat flux passing through the boundaries between the lake and the surrounding
    environment. The direction and magnitude of the net heat flux change over multiple
    time scales: from daily (day-night cycles), to seasonal (depending on the climatic
    conditions), and climatological (due to long-term trends). Most of the heat fluxes
    occur at the lake surface, between the lake and the overlying atmosphere, and
    are linked with natural processes. However, heat exchanges can also occur below
    the surface (e.g., thermal vents, groundwater-lake interactions) and may be due
    to anthropogenic activities (e.g., sewage inflows, selective withdrawals; see
    Figure 2). The net heat flux passing across the lake boundaries (Hnet, W/m2) can
    be summarized as: (1) that is the combination of net short-wave solar radiation
    (Hs,net), net long-wave radiation emitted from the sky (Ha,net) and from the water
    surface (Hw), sensible (Hc) and latent (He) heat fluxes, and advectived fluxes
    due to precipitation (Hp) and inflows/outflows (Hi/o). The first two terms in
    the equation account for the short-wave and long-wave reflectivities (albedoes)
    of the water, denoted by rs and ra in Figure 2. Specifically, Hs,net and Ha,net
    are calculated as (1 − rs)Hs and (1 − ra)Ha, respectively, where Hs and Ha are
    the incident radiations. We note that in the case of ice-covered lakes, the ice
    acts as insulation between the lake water and the atmosphere and influences surface
    albedo, hence it impacts the thermal dynamics of the lakes (for a more in-depth
    physical review, please refer to Kirillin et al. (2012)). Hereafter, all heat
    flux components (expressed in W/m2) are defined as positive when entering the
    lake (warming). The first three terms are referred to as radiative fluxes, the
    terms He and Hc as turbulent fluxes which depend on wind speed, air-water temperature
    difference, near surface humidity and atmospheric stability, and the last two
    terms as advective fluxes. All the radiative and turbulent fluxes are boundary
    fluxes acting at the water surface, while short-wave radiation penetrates and
    is attenuated through the water column thus acting as a volumetric source of heat
    (Bouffard & Wüest, 2019). We notice that it is a common practice to calculate
    all the heat flux terms in Equation 1 by dividing by the surface area of the lake
    A0, as it is there where most of the heat exchanges occur (Imboden & Wüest, 1995).
    This applies also to the advective heat exchanged with inflows and outflows, which
    can be written as: (2) where ρ is the density of water, cp its heat capacity,
    Qi/o is the inflows/outflows discharge and Ti/o its temperature. Equation 2 provides
    the module of Hi/o, its sign being positive for inflows and negative for outflows.
    The water temperature of outflows can be taken equal to the LSWT for surface outlets,
    and equal to lake water temperature at a given depth for withdrawals or groundwater
    seepage. Groundwater recharge is generally computed assuming that Ti is equal
    to the mean annual air temperature (Winter et al., 2003). We note that if the
    effect of inflows and outflows is included in the heat budget, the volume balance
    of the lake must be solved as well, unless it is reasonable to assume that the
    inflows balance the outflows (i.e., Qi = Qo = Q) and the lake does not undergo
    volume changes. In this case, Equation 2 can be used to evaluate the net inflows/outflows
    heat flux as follows: . In many practical applications, advective heat fluxes
    associated with inflows/outflows are neglected (Fukushima et al., 2022; Rahaghi
    et al., 2018), which can be a reasonable assumption for some but, clearly, not
    all large lakes (Raman Vinna et al., 2018), but not for small lakes with short
    residence times primarily controlled by riverine and groundwater exchanges (Carmack,
    1979). This is true also for the heat flux associated with precipitation (Hp),
    although in some cases it can be relevant (Rooney et al., 2018) depending on the
    rainfall intensity and temperature difference between the rain and lake. The term
    Hp is normally quantified by assuming the precipitation temperature to be equivalent
    to the wet bulb temperature at the time precipitation occurred (Sturrock et al.,
    1992). Finally, we note that the sensible heat flux (Hc) term also includes the
    heat flux exchanged by conduction at the water-sediment interface. Although this
    term is generally small due to the low thermal diffusivity of the lake sediments,
    it is important for many lakes, especially for shallow lakes (de la Fuente & Meruane,
    2017), where the ratio of sediment interface-to-lake volume is larger, and in
    ice-covered lakes, where also the heat fluxes across the lake surface are limited
    thus resulting in one of the main drivers for under-ice circulation and mixing
    (Kirillin et al., 2012). On average, the heat transfer is from lake water to bottom
    sediments in summer and from bottom sediments to lake water in winter, thus adding
    significant thermal inertia to the water column (Fang & Stefan, 1996). However,
    this heat exchange is very dynamic and changes direction frequently, particularly
    in transparent shallow lakes and littoral areas where sediments are heated by
    solar radiation directly. In lakes with volcanic or tectonic origins, the water-sediment
    flux is primarily governed by the geothermal heat flux, which can be especially
    relevant (Boehrer et al., 2013; Wood et al., 2023). We refer the interested reader
    to (Schmid & Read, 2022) for a recent overview of the heat budget of lakes, which
    provides a quantitative comparison among the different heat flux components for
    a temperate and a tropical lake (the radiative fluxes being the dominant terms,
    see also Imboden and Wüest (1995)) and contains some selected references to case
    studies that may be of interest to deepen some aspects of the topic. Figure 2
    Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Schematic of the main heat flux components contributing
    to the heat balance of a lake. The subdivision of the lake volume into epilimnion,
    metalimnion and hypolimnion is also shown, assuming an hypothetical temperature
    profile and corresponding Brunt-Väisälä frequency profile. The lake in the schematic
    is inspired by Crater Lake and its Wizard Island (Oregon, USA). The heat flux
    components listed in Equation 1 can be measured directly or calculated using equations
    derived from well-known principles of physics (e.g., the Stefan-Boltzman law for
    the long-wave heat fluxes), fundamental trigonometric principles of astronomy
    (e.g., to calculate extraterrestrial short-wave radiation under clear sky conditions
    and flat topography), or extensively validated empirical relationships (e.g.,
    the Dalton''s law for the evaporative heat flux). Detailed reviews of the most
    established literature parameterizations used to quantify the surface heat fluxes
    can be found in Henderson-Sellers (1986) and J. L. Martin and McCutcheon (1999),
    among others, and a script for calculating the surface energy fluxes according
    to these and other methodologies has been provided by Woolway et al. (2015). Additionally,
    many lake models are published with large sections and appendices describing the
    details of the heat flux equations and the decision trees for their implementation
    (Cole & Wells, 2006; Goudsmit et al., 2002; Hamrick, 1992; Hipsey et al., 2019;
    Piccolroaz et al., 2013). Here, we provide only the key equations that are needed
    for the comprehension of the modeling sections. Following Edinger et al. (1968),
    we refer to the sum of Hs,net and Ha,net as the absorbed radiation, which is independent
    of the surface water temperature Ts, and that can be measured or computed from
    meteorological observations (see e.g., Henderson-Sellers, 1986). All the other
    terms depend in different ways on Ts, air temperature, water vapor pressure, wind
    speed, and other variables as explained below. The emitted long-wave radiation
    Hw is described by the Stefan-Boltzman''s law: (3) where Ts is the surface water
    temperature in °C, T0 = 273.15, ϵw is the emissivity of water (i.e., about 0.97),
    and σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant (i.e., 5.67 × 10−8 W m−2 K−4). The minus
    sign indicates that the heat flux is from the lake to the atmosphere. This equation
    can be simplified by taking the Taylor expansion of the above equation around
    the origin and truncating it at the second-order term since Ts ≪ T0, to give:
    (4) The rate of heat loss by evaporation He can be expressed as a simple bulk
    formula: (5) where L is the latent heat of evaporation, the f(W) is a transfer
    function that can be chosen from a wide range of empirical relationships essentially
    depending on the wind speed W, and is the difference between the saturated vapor
    pressure at the surface water temperature and the actual vapor pressure at the
    temperature of the air. Often, this equation is simplified by approximating the
    relationship between the saturation vapor pressure of water and the water temperature
    by a linear function of the form: (6) where Td represents the dew point temperature
    (i.e., the temperature the air needs to be cooled, at constant pressure and constant
    water vapor content, to become saturated with water vapor), and the slope δ of
    the linear approximation can be quantified using observed values of Ts and Td
    and reading values of es and ea from a curve of vapor pressure versus temperature.
    Introducing the Bowen ratio as the ratio between sensible and latent heat fluxes
    where ξ is the psychrometric constant which depends on atmospheric pressure and
    temperature, the heat flux by conduction is given by: (7) By substituting Equations
    3-7 into Equation 1 and neglecting the effects of precipitation, inflows/outflows,
    and water-sediment exchanges, the net heat exchange can be expressed as: (8) This
    is an approximate estimate of Hnet. To obtain the precise quantification of the
    heat fluxes contributing to Hnet, specific coefficients and correction functions
    should be taken into account. For example, atmospheric stability should be considered
    in the estimation of the turbulent fluxes. Ideally, these coefficients and correction
    functions are known, but in practice, they are often case-study-dependent and
    need to be determined through calibration (Rahaghi et al., 2018). One way to do
    this is by writing the heat balance of the lake, which equates the change in time
    of the total heat content of the lake (HC) with the net heat flux exchanged with
    the surrounding environment: (9) where t is time and z is the vertical coordinate,
    T is the water temperature of the lake, V its volume and A0 its surface area.
    If water temperature profiles are available in space and time, Equation 9 can
    be used to tune the calibration parameters included in the different components
    of Hnet (Fukushima et al., 2022; Rahaghi et al., 2018). The same heat balance
    can be used to quantify unknown heat flux components (Sturrock et al., 1992; Winter
    et al., 2003), by relying on measured water temperature profiles to calculate
    HC and on measurements or estimations (using equations with predefined or best
    guess parameters'' values) of the other heat fluxes. When the net heat flux Hnet
    is known, Equation 9 can be used to evaluate the change in time of the HC of the
    lake. Taking V equal to the total volume of the lake, this provides the change
    in time of the average water temperature of the lake Tlake. Likewise, considering
    V equal to the volume of surface well-mixed layer Vs, it is possible to calculate
    the change in time of the average water temperature within this layer, reasonably
    assuming that during the stratified period vertical transfer of heat below the
    thermocline is inhibited (see e.g., Toffolon et al., 2022). In this case, if we
    assume that the heat gain/loss associated to the temporal variation of the volume
    of the surface well-mixed layer is of minor importance, then the volume term can
    be extracted from the time derivative and the change in time of water temperature
    in this layer (Ts) can be expressed as: (10) where Ds = Vs/A0 is the average depth
    of the surface well-mixed layer. This is the reference equation at the basis of
    physically-based zero-dimensional (0D) or half-dimensional (0.5D) lake temperature
    models (see Sections 6 and 14). The spatial variability of water temperature is
    shaped by the transport and mixing processes taking place within the lake, which
    are primarily determined by the fluxes of mechanical energy and by lake morphology.
    Spatial and temporal changes in water temperature are described by the advection-diffusion
    equation for temperature T that, using Einstein summation notation where repeated
    indices imply the summation over all the values of the index (j = 1, 2, 3), reads:
    (11) where ST is a source or sink term for heat production or consumption, uj
    is the jth component of the velocity along the xj direction, D is the molecular
    diffusivity of temperature, and the second term on the left-hand side represents
    the advective term. As all natural water bodies, lakes are turbulent environments,
    where the fine-scale structures of the flow embedded in the advective term of
    Equation 11 generates turbulent mixing that is usually much faster than molecular
    diffusion (Fisher et al., 1979; Imboden & Wüest, 1995). Accounting for turbulence
    explicitly would require solving the equations expressing conservation of mass
    and conservation of momentum (i.e., the Navier-Stokes equation) and the advection-diffusion
    equation on fine computational grids and using small time steps (Direct Numerical
    Simulation—DNS), to an extent that is normally prohibitive for environmental applications.
    A classical way to account for turbulent fluxes in a computationally affordable
    way is through Reynolds'' decomposition, which consists in simplifying the governing
    equations by statistically splitting variables such as velocity and temperature
    into a temporal mean component (representative of the mean, large scale advection
    and denoted with an overbar) and a fluctuating term about the mean component (accounting
    for small-scale turbulent fluctuations and denoted with a prime ′). For the generic
    variable f, the Reynolds'' decomposition reads: . By substituting each variable
    in Equation 11 by the sum of the mean and perturbation components and by taking
    the time-average of the resulting equation (we refer to classical fluid mechanics
    books such as e.g., Kundu & Cohen, 2012 for the details), the advection-diffusion
    equation for temperature can be rewritten into: (12) in which the rules and have
    been used. This is the advection-diffusion equation valid for the mean flow and
    accounting for transport of water temperature due to turbulent mixing through
    the non-linear term . The unknown higher-order correlations between fluctuating
    velocity and temperature introduced by this term can be approximated using lower-order
    closure schemes. The simplest approach is the use of a first-order local closure
    scheme according to the so-called eddy formulation where the turbulent flux of
    temperature is modeled as being proportional to the local gradient of the mean
    temperature through a positive coefficient called eddy diffusion of temperature:
    (13) From this it follows that the turbulent fluxes of temperature, as well as
    of any other scalar property, flows down the local gradient of the mean temperature,
    analogous to molecular transport (see Fick''s first law). Since the eddy diffusivity
    is typically much larger than its molecular counterpart, the eddy formulation
    allows to transform Equation 12 by neglecting molecular diffusion (but assuming
    it as the lower bound of , that is ) into: (14) To solve this equation, the associated
    flow field is required to quantify the advective heat exchanges and determine
    the eddy diffusivity of temperature. This can be done by solving the three- or
    two-dimensional (3D or 2D) conservation of mass and momentum equations or, in
    many practical applications, through reducing the problem to a 1D diffusion equation
    along the vertical direction, neglecting advective fluxes and introducing empirical
    algebraic models to describe eddy diffusivity and vertical mixing (see Sections
    15 and 16, respectively). 3 Water Temperature Monitoring Approaches Water temperature
    is one of the most widely monitored characteristic of lakes. Typically water temperature
    is routinely measured by various governmental agencies, universities and companies
    in thousands of lakes around the world. Water temperature records, however, are
    different in terms of type of collected data and the instruments used to collect
    them. As a first level classification, we can distinguish between in situ monitoring
    and remote sensing and then between manual and automatic measurements. Depending
    on the considered monitoring methodology, the spatial, temporal, and temperature
    resolutions can be different and, in general, can span different orders of magnitudes.
    Furthermore, the spatial and temporal coverage generally differ significantly.
    In this section, we present the main monitoring methodologies (Figure 3). Figure
    3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Overview of the main methodologies used to
    collect water temperature data in a lake. 3.1 In Situ Monitoring Systematic records
    of water temperature began in the 20th century (see e.g., Kangur et al., 2021;
    Livingstone & Dokulil, 2001). Historically these measurements were collected manually
    using mercury thermometers directly immersed (a) in the lake surface water to
    measure LSWT or (b) in water samples collected at depth and brought up to the
    boat deck (e.g., Hampton et al., 2008) or using reversing thermometers integrated
    in sampling bottles (e.g., Leoni et al., 2019) when collecting water temperature
    profiles. Historical LSWT records were often collected relatively close to the
    shore (e.g., Gerten & Adrian, 2000; McCormick & Fahnenstiel, 1999) and sometimes
    in river outlets just downstream of a lake (e.g., Austin & Colman, 2007), while
    full water temperature profiles were typically taken in the deepest point of a
    lake (e.g., Rimet et al., 2020; Salmaso et al., 2014). In order to ensure continuity
    and homogeneity of observations, the historical monitoring points have been typically
    kept unchanged throughout time. According to the global data sets and relative
    methodological details published by Sharma et al. (2015) for LSWT and Pilla et
    al. (2021) for water temperature profiles, manual sampling was typically scheduled
    in the morning and in the early afternoon, with a time frequency that ranged from
    daily to monthly with sporadic cases in which water temperature was sampled twice
    daily, in the morning and in the evening (Noges & Noges, 2014). Due to technological
    and automation advancements, mercury thermometers have been progressively replaced
    by digital thermometers and/or multi-parametric probes, and manual sampling replaced
    by automatic sampling using buoys equipped with surface sensors (e.g., Austin
    & Colman, 2007) or moored stations equipped with thermistor chains providing water
    temperature measurements at discrete depths (Tiberti et al., 2021; Valerio et
    al., 2012). In some cases, these moored stations are real floating laboratories,
    providing space for laboratory equipment and personnel (see Wüest et al., 2021
    that details the LéXPLORE platform on Lake Geneva and a list of other lake platforms).
    The introduction of a new generation of temperature sensors in place of mercury
    thermometers significantly improved the resolution of the measurements (from O(0.1)
    K Niedrist et al., 2018) to O(0.1) mK (Van Haren et al., 2005)) and the automation
    of the monitoring stations increased the sampling frequency. In this case, more
    than reporting on the wide spectrum of possible sampling frequencies that are
    available nowadays (up to 1,024 Hz for microstructure purposes, see e.g., Kolås
    et al. (2022), but the choice is dependent on the compromise between desired resolution
    of the final data set and available storage capacity), it is probably more relevant
    commenting on the advantages introduced by automated stations in terms of limiting
    the well-recognized influence of weather conditions on the availability/quality
    of the final measurements. On the one hand manual measurements suffer from the
    so-called “fair weather bias,” where manual sampling is avoided or impossible
    in bad weather conditions, and on the other hand the quality and accuracy of these
    measurements, when their acquisition is logistically possible, are affected by
    the weather conditions (Rand et al., 2022). However, it should be noted that the
    availability of continuous, automatic in situ monitoring can be affected by the
    presence of harsh weather/climate conditions: a clear example is the removal of
    surface buoys from the Laurentian Great Lakes when they freeze in winter to avoid
    risk of damage by ice (e.g., Van Cleave et al., 2014). Automatic monitoring also
    allowed for installing networks of sensors within a lake (e.g., Hart & Martinez,
    2006; Meinson et al., 2016) or in different lakes of a region (e.g., Vitale et
    al., 2018), generating spatially distributed in situ data to an extent that was
    improbable using manual sampling alone. However, it should be recognized that
    earlier examples of distributed monitoring based on manual sampling are available
    even for large lakes (see e.g., Izmest''eva et al., 2016 for a network of 79 stations
    sampled ca. annually from 1977 to 2003 in Lake Baikal, Russia). Despite the advent
    of automatic measurements, manual monitoring has not been disappearing and, in
    many cases, it is still the only source of observations. Manual monitoring is
    routinely performed with CTD or multiparametric probes for research and quality
    control purposes. Besides routine measurements, typical manual monitoring activities
    include the acquisition of high frequency temperature microstructure profiles
    for turbulence analysis (e.g., Macintyre et al., 2021), which can also be used
    for investigating specific physical (e.g., Piccolroaz et al., 2019) and biological
    processes (e.g., Sepúlveda Steiner et al., 2019). It should be noted that in recent
    years there were attempts to alleviate the operational burden associated with
    taking this type of measurements, through the development of automatic microstructure
    profilers either (a) propelled by the action of waves and moving vertically along
    a wire (Pinkel et al., 2011) or (b) propelled by internal-battery-powered thrusters
    and free to drift (see e.g., the Argo float program, Roemmich & Owens, 2000 or
    the ASIP—Air-Sea Interaction Profiler, Ward et al., 2014) that have been used
    in the ocean. Buoyancy-driven Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs; also called
    gliders) were also traditionally developed for application in the oceans, but
    their limnological applications are increasing, particularly in large lakes as
    such as Lake Superior (Austin, 2012, 2013), Lake Tahoe (McInerney et al., 2019),
    and Lake Geneva (Sepúlveda Steiner et al., 2023). Gliders allow for repeated observations
    covering long distances over periods from days to weeks. These instruments are
    typically operated in “yo-yo” mode, conducting depth/distance transects with a
    time and spatial resolution that are difficult to attain using other manual or
    automatic monitoring techniques. In this respect, the use of gliders is particularly
    promising for the understanding of temperature related processes such as internal
    waves and deep intrusions, thus being particularly useful for the validation of
    2D and 3D lake models. Among the emerging techniques for spatially distributed
    monitoring, we refer to the use of autonomously operating vessels to measure near
    surface water temperatures, and drones and balloons (Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles—UAVs)
    equipped with infrared camera for the observation of lake surface thermography
    (Irani Rahaghi et al., 2019). In the latter case, high resolution maps (∼1 m)
    can be acquired, thus allowing to appreciate LSWT patterns at sub-pixel satellite
    scale (see the next section and Table 1). Table 1. Infrared Sensors and Satellite

    for thermal infrared. 3.2 Satellite Observation of LSWT Records of LSWT based
    on in situ measurements are not always easily accessible, and global-scale in
    situ LSWT observations are rare. This is particularly the case for tropical lakes,
    where compared with temperate and arctic regions, long-term, in situ LSWT data
    sets are scarce. Furthermore, the available in situ data do not provide comprehensive
    coverage of entire lake surface and are limited to point measurements. Additionally,
    there is significant variation in the temporal coverage of data across different
    lakes, making it challenging to conduct global or regional studies with a high
    degree of certainty. In contrast, satellite observations have provided a global
    archive of LSWT in recent decades, oftentimes with several passes per day, with
    progressively higher spatial and temporal resolution in recent years. This invaluable
    data source, which can rectify the latitude bias of in situ LSWT monitoring, allows
    for near-daily observations of LSWT over the full lake, across many lakes worldwide
    consistently for the same period of time, depending, of course, on the availability
    of cloud-free pixels. Indeed, satellite Earth Observation data are critical for
    studying climate change impacts on lakes worldwide by routinely measuring LSWT
    from space. Satellite Earth observations have largely contributed to the availability
    of global lake observations in recent decades (Carrea, Crétaux, et al., 2023;
    MacCallum & Merchant, 2012; Schneider & Hook, 2010), and can be considered a key
    tool for assessing climate change impacts in lakes worldwide. LSWT is defined
    as an Essential Climate Variable (ECV) by the Global Climate Observing System
    (GCOS) (GCOS-244, 2022). To be considered an ECV, a variable must meet three primary
    criteria: (a) that the variable in question is critical for characterizing the
    climate system and its changes; (b) observing and deriving the variable on a global
    scale is technically feasible using proven and scientifically sound methods; and
    (c) generating and archiving data on the variable is affordable, mainly relying
    on coordinated observing systems using proven technology. LSWT meets these criteria,
    largely owing to recent developments in satellite technology and processing methods,
    which have made the characterization of LSWT from space more comprehensive and
    quantitatively robust, overcoming the lack of a standardization of observations
    that characterizes long-term ground-based observational data. Though satellite
    observations have greatly expanded our ability to monitor lake temperature across
    the globe, it is not without challenges. Efforts investigating lake responses
    to climatic variations need to be grounded in a sustainable and systematic way.
    Lake water temperature is measured from satellite by an instrument called a radiometer,
    but not directly. The quantity measured by the radiometer is the radiant flux
    (energy emitted per unit time) emitted by the surface of the lake water per unit
    solid angle and unit projected area. This quantity is called radiance and the
    temperature is then inferred through mathematical inversion (Rodgers, 2000). To
    retrieve LSWT, radiances are measured for frequency bands in the infrared (but
    also microwave) region of the electromagnetic spectrum. In these frequency bands,
    the atmosphere is almost transparent and when no clouds are present, the radiances
    measured by the satellite are related to the energy emitted by the surface water
    and ultimately to the temperature of the water. Using an infrared radiometer operating
    at wavelengths across 3.7–12 μm, the water temperature is sensed at a depth of
    10–20 μm, depending on the local energy flux through the surface of the water.
    This depth is within the so-called “skin layer.” This skin layer is the molecular
    boundary between a turbulent water surface and a turbulent atmosphere. Below the
    skin layer, water temperatures then transition to what is commonly referred to
    as the “bulk” temperature. This bulk layer temperature is comparable to that measured
    conventionally using floating thermometers or instruments mounted on in situ monitoring
    stations. The bulk temperature is consistently warmer than the skin temperature,
    typically by a few tenths of a degree, but the difference between the two can
    also be much higher (Hondzo et al., 2022; Hook et al., 2003; Wilson et al., 2013).
    This temperature difference between the skin and bulk temperature is commonly
    known as the cool skin effect (Fairall et al., 1996; Minnett et al., 2011), the
    magnitude of which is influenced by the air-water surface heat fluxes (Hondzo
    et al., 2022; Wilson et al., 2013). The cool skin effect also varies considerably
    at diurnal timescales (Hook et al., 2003). In brief, nighttime skin temperature
    retrievals are considered to provide better accuracy than daytime data when compared
    with bulk temperatures due to, among other things, the absence of solar heating
    (Hook et al., 2003). At depths of a meter or more below the lake surface a bulk
    temperature measurement can differ from the skin layer by a few degrees Celsius,
    depending on the depth and variability of the diurnal mixed layer (Imberger, 1985).
    Although the cool skin effect in lakes leads to oftentimes noticeable differences
    between bulk temperatures and those measured from satellite Earth observations,
    skin surface temperatures are nonetheless tightly coupled to temporal variations
    in bulk lake surface temperature, particularly over long timescales. In turn,
    these global observations have been used extensively to observe climate change
    signals in lakes. For several decades, satellite Earth observation have provided
    continuous data for observing spatial and temporal variations of LSWT worldwide
    (see Table 1 and T. Jia et al., 2022 for a recent review). Most studies have been
    based on moderate spatial resolution high radiometric quality meteorological sensors,
    with a pixel size of approximately 1 km, including MODerate resolution Imaging
    Spectroradiometer (MODIS), Along Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR), and Sea and
    Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR), at up to daily time scales (Carrea,
    Crétaux, et al., 2023; MacCallum & Merchant, 2012; Reinart & Reinhold, 2008; Schneider
    et al., 2009). These have been heavily relied upon to estimate LSWT in recent
    years, as well as to investigate lake responses to climate change. However, their
    application to small sized lakes is limited due to their relatively moderate spatial
    resolution, resulting in most global scale studies being restricted to the largest
    lakes of the world (Carrea, Crétaux, et al., 2023; MacCallum & Merchant, 2012;
    Schneider & Hook, 2010). In contrast, Landsat satellites could provide useful
    information of LSWT for both large and small lakes worldwide. The strength of
    Landsat includes its high spatial and radiometric resolution, and long-term continuous
    record. However, the 16-day revisit time, which can be longer due to cloud cover,
    limits the applicability of Landsat for tracking sub-seasonal patterns in surface
    water temperature. This can be particularly problematic for some parts of the
    world where cloud cover is common (see Figure 4 and relative discussion below),
    thus limiting the reliability of estimated changes in LSWT. Furthermore, Landsat
    offers two infrared channels only from Landsat 8 onwards in the series, which
    do observe at 100 m resolution. However, currently no mature LSWT method or product
    of the accuracy required by users for climate related purposes (of order 0.5 K
    or better; GCOS-245, 2022; Schaeffer et al., 2018) is available for Landsat data.
    Future developments are aiming to improve high resolution LSWT retrievals. Figure
    4 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint (a) Number of days when a lake surface water
    temperature (LSWT) observation at the lake center (as defined in Carrea et al.
    (2015)) is present in the timeseries over the 1995–2022 period in the European
    Space Agency-Climate Change Initiative Lakes LSWT data set v2.0.2 (Carrea, Crétaux,
    et al., 2022) extended for the European Union Copernicus Climate Change Service
    (Carrea et al., 2020). Note that the number of days in the period 1995–2022 with
    satellite coverage over the 2024 lakes is 9,757. Observations associated to quality
    level 1 (bad data) have been discarded as they should never be used. (b) Fraction
    of daytime LSWT of quality levels 4 and 5 in relation to the total number of available
    observations (quality levels ≥2) shown in subplot (a). LSWTs of quality levels
    4 and 5 are the only ones which should be safely used. (c) LSWT trend for 1976
    lakes calculated over the 1995–2022 period. Note that to avoid overlapping in
    high density areas, the dot has been plotted at the latitude of the lake center
    but the longitude has been shifted. Some of the first studies investigating the
    impact of climate change on global LSWT via satellite Earth observation focused
    on a central within-lake region (Schneider & Hook, 2010). This central region,
    often defined relative to a maximum distance from land and based on 3 × 3 arrays
    of ∼1 km2, was chosen to provide a balance between sampling a relatively large
    surface area and conservatively avoiding any potential bias by including shoreline
    pixels, which would result in contamination of the LSWT retrieval. Subsequent
    studies that were able to investigate spatially resolved LSWT, and provide pixel-based
    information, calculated both average LSWT (i.e., averages across all pixels within
    a water body) (MacCallum & Merchant, 2012; Woolway & Merchant, 2017) and within-lake
    thermal patterns, as well as their responses to climate change (Calamita et al.,
    2021; Mason et al., 2016; Woolway & Merchant, 2018; Zhong et al., 2016). Specifically,
    studies that have investigated spatially resolved observations of LSWT demonstrated
    considerable within-lake warming patterns, with warming rates often differing
    at sub-basin scales (Kraemer et al., 2015; Mason et al., 2016; Zhong et al., 2016).
    The Laurentian Great Lakes, for example, show clear intra-lake warming patterns,
    often associated with shortening winter ice cover as well as other geophysical
    factors, such as bathymetry (Calamita et al., 2021; Mason et al., 2016; Toffolon
    et al., 2020; Zhong et al., 2016). In particular, higher summer warming rates
    have been reported over the deepest parts of the Laurentian Great Lakes. Similar
    responses have also been reported in other lakes throughout the Northern Hemisphere
    (Woolway & Merchant, 2018). Such analyses of spatially resolved LSWTs have been
    pivotal in improving our understanding of within-lake thermal responses to climate
    change and the underlying mechanisms. LSWT from satellite and measured on-site
    are used in climate reports, such as the State of the Climate Report released
    every year by the Bulletin of the American Society (see for example Carrea, Merchant,
    et al., 2023), where the lake-average warm-season temperature anomalies of the
    year are reported in the context of the anomalies across the full extension in
    time of the satellite data record. Satellites provide consistent data in space
    and time, which allow us to understand where water bodies are more drastically
    impacted by global climate change. The latest published version of LSWT data set
    (Carrea et al., 2020; Carrea, Crétaux, et al., 2022; Carrea, Crétaux, et al.,
    2023; Carrea, Merchant, et al., 2023) from satellites is currently provided for
    a period of 25 years (with harmonisation across different instruments), with regular
    updates aiming to increase the temporal coverage of the record, and with future
    releases that will include improvements of the data set/coverage. The LSWTs of
    2,024 lakes (selected within the European Space Agency-ESA Climate Change Initiative-CCI
    project, Carrea, Merchant, & Simis, 2022) are available at a spatial resolution
    of about 1 km, on regular grid, with an estimation of the uncertainty and a confidence
    level (quality level), and they are validated against in situ data. The LSWT data
    set has been created utilising only daytime imagery as it was coupled with a threshold-based
    water detection algorithm that does not rely on a solid prior to classify water/non-water
    pixels. The time resolution and spatial coverage of satellite data depends, among
    other factors, on the cloud/ice cover, since radiances that are affected by clouds/ice
    differ from clear-sky radiances (Merchant et al., 2019). Figure 4a illustrates
    the total number of available observations at the lake centre (Carrea et al.,
    2015), which exclude LSWT measurements at a quality level equal to 1 and days
    without LSWT values due to various factors such as cloud cover, ice cover, polar
    night, among others. We note that we excluded quality level 1 (bad data) from
    the count as they should never be used (Carrea, Crétaux, et al., 2023). The tropical
    area is known to be affected by clouds, as confirmed by the figure, which clearly
    shows that data availability for lakes located at equatorial latitudes is lower
    in comparison to other regions. A low number of days with observations is appreciable
    also in the Arctics, which is primarily attributed to polar nights, which restrict
    LSWT daytime observations, and ice cover. Likewise, the frequency of observations
    decreases towards higher latitudes and in the Tibetan Plateau due to ice cover,
    while in Australia because the selected lakes are very likely experiencing drying
    out conditions. Figure 4b shows the fraction of LSWT with good/best quality levels,
    specifically quality levels 4 and 5, recommended for climate applications, for
    each lake with respect to the total number of available observations reported
    in Figure 4a. The map clearly indicates that the tropics have the lowest fraction
    of observations of good quality, primarily due to factors such as thin clouds
    and high density of low water vapor, which make the retrieval of LSWT more complex.
    Despite the inherent data gaps in satellite observations, they remain highly valuable
    for describing where climate change is currently impacting water bodies most substantially.
    This is primarily due to the consistent global coverage provided by a limited
    number of instruments, whose characteristics are well-known and closely monitored
    during their orbital operation. Figure 4c shows LSWT trends computed from 1995
    to 2022 of the lake-average warm-season LSWT anomalies. The warm season is defined
    as July-August-September for the northern hemisphere, January-February-March for
    the southern hemisphere and the whole year for the tropics (region between the
    ±23.5 parallels). Only the acceptable/best quality levels LSWT data have been
    used to compute the trends for 1978 lakes (out of the ESA CCI 2024 for which a
    sufficient number of observations was available). From Figure 4c it can be clearly
    seen that lakes in southern and eastern Europe, in the Middle East, eastern China,
    and in some regions in the Arctics are warming faster than the lakes in the other
    regions. Overall, the majority of lakes, approximately 85%, exhibit a warming
    trend. However, there are a few regions, particularly in the southern hemisphere
    and in Central Asia, where this warming pattern is less prevalent. Satellite Earth
    observation data are also often used to validate LSWT simulations in climate change
    assessments. For example, satellite-derived LSWTs have been used to validate lake
    models, which were then applied in the analysis of seasonal cycles (Maberly et
    al., 2020), the onset of summer stratification and overturning behavior (Fichot
    et al., 2019; Woolway, Jennings, et al., 2021), and climate-induced alterations
    in lake mixing regimes (Woolway & Merchant, 2019). However, it''s important to
    note that if the error in satellite-derived surface temperatures (e.g., Schaeffer
    et al., 2018) is greater than the predictive error from models, then satellite
    Earth observations are less useful for validating simulations (e.g., Willard,
    Read, et al., 2022). 4 Classification of Lake Temperature Models For many decades,
    two major types of models have been used to simulate lake temperatures: statistical
    models based on regressions, and deterministic models. More recently, two other
    groups of models have been developed, namely machine learning (ML) models, and
    hybrid models that combine statistical or ML approaches with process-based approaches.
    These different models can be represented on a two-dimensional plane, where one
    axis measures the amount of data needed to run a model and the other measures
    the scientific knowledge required to represent the underlying processes (see Figure
    5, modified from Karpatne et al. (2017)). The combination of statistical and ML
    models belongs to the realm of data-driven models, which directly distill critical
    information from data sets to elucidate system behavior and relationships among
    variables. Conversely, deterministic models require the formulation of first principles
    and relationships among variables, according to empirically or theoretically derived
    laws. When scientific knowledge is limited, deterministic models may require simplifying
    assumptions that can reduce their performance and make it difficult to interpret
    the results. Similarly, when data are scarce, data science models may struggle
    to learn as well as extrapolate from the data, and identify relationships among
    variables. In this regard, hybrid models combine the available sources of information,
    leveraging available data while being grounded on the underlying scientific knowledge
    (Karpatne et al., 2017). Figure 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Classification
    of lake temperature models based on model type and scientific knowledge versus
    data information requirements (adapted from Karpatne et al. (2017)). Statistical
    models have the advantages of being simple and generally requiring little data
    for their use. These models provide mathematical relationships between forcing
    variables and the target variable (water temperature), without inferring the mechanistic
    connections among them. For this reason, their performance is highly dependent
    on the case study and quality of data at hand, and their use may be questionable
    when applied with input variables going beyond the limits used for model calibration,
    as for example, in climate changes studies (Piccolroaz et al., 2018) or when extreme
    events are of interest (Jankowski et al., 2006; Shinohara et al., 2023). These
    models require little or no scientific knowledge about the simulated processes,
    making them accessible to a wider range of users. The boundary between statistical
    models and ML is a topic of current debate (see e.g., Bzdok, 2017; Bzdok et al.,
    2018; Wikle & Zammit-Mangion, 2023), and one may consider the two types of models
    belonging to the same macro-group. The main difference between classical statistics
    and ML methods can be found in the degree of automation (which is lower for statistical
    models), complexity, and in the number of assumptions that are needed to solve
    a problem (which is higher for statistical models). Deep learning methods are
    generally regarded as a subset of ML, and have been combined with both statistical
    models (Shlezinger et al., 2023; Wikle & Zammit-Mangion, 2023) and physical models
    (Read et al., 2019; Reichstein et al., 2019; Y. Zhu et al., 2023). Deep learning
    models have limited assumptions on the data and processes that are to be modeled,
    and can use a large amount of information. However, they cannot be treated as
    a panacea for solving any task, as they can learn spurious relationships and make
    bad predictions outside of observed conditions, can demand a lot of computational
    resources (Menghani, 2023), and can sometimes be less accurate than process-based
    or simpler statistical models (Gamage & Samarabandu, 2020; Korbmacher & Todeaux,
    2022; Rajula et al., 2020; H. Zhao et al., 2022). Deterministic models, also referred
    to as mechanistic, process-based or theory-based models (see e.g., Soares and
    do Carmo Calijuri, 2021) simulate the fundamental processes relevant for lake
    water temperature, including the accurate quantification of the different energy
    fluxes involved. The development of these conceptual models requires an understanding
    of the fundamental processes involved and the ability to represent them mathematically.
    Depending on the complexity of the processes involved, these models may require
    a significant amount of diverse data for their proper functioning, which may not
    always be available with sufficient spatial and temporal coverage. Hybrid models
    are somewhat in between process-based and statistical models (in its wider sense,
    including classical statistics, statistical learning, data-driven optimization,
    up to deep learning). These models combine first principle-based models with data-driven
    models into a joint architecture (Kurz et al., 2022) and aim at preserving some
    of the physical realism of process-based models, while allowing for the flexibility,
    simplicity, and performance of data-driven models. Hybrid models do not necessarily
    use more knowledge or data, but combine the benefits of process-based and statistical
    models, placing them at a level equal to or below the highest data and knowledge
    use scenarios (Figure 5). Models can also be classified according to the number
    of spatial dimensions that they can solve, ranging from zero-dimensional (0D)
    to three-dimensional (3D) models (see Figure 6). The choice of the best model
    to use depends upon the processes that are investigated and the morphological
    characteristics of the lake at hand and is often constrained by the type and quality
    of available data. In this respect, we refer the interested reader to the study
    by Ishikawa et al. (2022) for a detailed comparison among models with different
    dimensions (from 1D to 3D) in relation to their ability in simulating, among others,
    thermal stratification in a medium-sized drinking-water reservoir. Here, we provide
    a description of each category of model along with references to the most relevant
    literature on the topic, with a particular focus on 0D and 1D models passing through
    0.5D models. Figure 6 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Classification of lake
    temperature models according to the number of spatial dimensions solved. 4.1 0D
    Models 0D models (also termed bulk models) are used for modeling either LSWT or
    the vertically homogeneous water temperature of a lake assuming complete mixing
    throughout the water column (e.g., in shallow lakes). Depending on the spatial
    representativeness of the data used for model calibration, 0D models can be used
    to model spatially-averaged or local lake water temperature. In all cases, this
    category of models does not consider any spatial variability in either horizontal
    or vertical direction. These models generally belong to the category of statistical
    models (e.g., Sharma et al., 2008; Willard, Read, et al., 2022), although there
    are examples of hybrid 0D models (e.g., Bilello, 1964; Kettle et al., 2004). Furthermore,
    since such models are typically designed for the purpose of predicting LSWT, according
    to the notation already introduced in Equation 10, in the following we will denote
    water temperature as Ts. This can be interpreted as the temperature of the surface
    well-mixed layer (i.e., the epilimnion, see Figure 2) normally measured from ships,
    buoys, or moored stations at depths ranging from centimeters to a couple of meters
    below the lake surface (bulk temperature) or as the temperature of the thin surface
    layer on the order of 10 μm generally measured by infrared radiometers (skin temperature;
    see Section 4). 4.1.1 Climatological Models An example of 0D statistical models
    are sinusoidal models fitted to observed data, which are able to capture LSWT
    seasonality and the timing of maximum and minimum temperatures, but limited to
    the climatological mean only, thus neglecting any inter-annual variability. These
    models can be first-order models based on a sine-cosine pair with annual periodicity
    (Flaim et al., 2016) or higher-order models with additional sine-cosine pairs
    characterized by sub-annual periodicity (Minns et al., 2018): (15) where β denotes
    a generic model parameter both here and throughout the rest of the text, DOY refers
    to the day of the year, and n is the number of sine-cosine pairs. Likewise, certain
    authors proposed models founded on the complementary error function erfc (Hutorowicz,
    2020), which take the form: (16) However, one may prefer to consider the climatological
    year obtained by averaging the temperature for each DOY as a better, first-approximation
    model of the water temperature seasonality. Expanding upon these basic models,
    a more sophisticated, yet still simple, statistical 0D model is the three part,
    trapezoidal-like model proposed by Trumpickas et al. (2009) consisting of linear
    warming through the spring, a plateau in mid-summer, and linear cooling in fall.
    Besides being lake-specific, the model parameters are year-specific, allowing
    to determine the relationships between model parameters and climate variables
    (e.g., air temperature). These relationships can be used to draw preliminary climate-change-related
    considerations in the context of expected climate scenarios. 4.1.2 Regression
    Models Moving toward more advanced statistical 0D models, we can refer to statistical
    models that utilize multivariate regressions to establish the correlation between
    water temperature and one or more predictors. These models allow for a deeper
    understanding of the seasonality and inter-annual variability of water temperature.
    A generic multivariate regression model can be represented as: (17) where x1,
    x2, …, xN are the independent variables (the predictors), β0, β1, β2, …, βN are
    the regression coefficients, and ϵ is the error term. Previous studies found that
    water temperature can be effectively explained by utilizing a combination of different
    predictors. The most commonly used predictors include meteorological variables
    like air temperature, dew point temperature, solar radiation, wind speed, wind
    direction and precipitation (Hondzo & Stefan, 1993). Geographical information
    such as latitude, longitude and elevation are additional factors that have been
    considered, particularly when the objective is to set-up a multi-lake modeling
    framework specifically tailored to a specific region (e.g., Bachmann et al., 2019;
    Livingstone et al., 1999; Sabás et al., 2021). Lake morphological variables such
    as lake area, volume, depth, and shape have been shown to be important factors
    affecting water temperature dynamics (e.g., Calamita et al., 2021; Edmundson &
    Mazumder, 2002; Kettle et al., 2004; Toffolon et al., 2014; Woolway et al., 2016),
    and as such have been considered as relevant predictors in several statistical
    models (Edmundson & Mazumder, 2002; Sharma et al., 2008; Shuter et al., 1983;
    Snucins & Gunn, 2000). In accordance with the climate-morphometry-typology hierarchical
    framework, as proposed by Edmundson and Mazumder (2002) to describe the thermal
    properties of Alaskan lakes, another significant set of predictors pertains to
    water quality and chemistry (Rose et al., 2016). These may include parameters
    such as Secchi depth (a measure of water clarity, introduced by Italian priest
    and scientist Pietro Angelo Secchi in the mid-19th century, determined by lowering
    a standard disk into the water until it is no longer visible, then measuring the
    depth at which it disappears), turbidity, water color, and dissolved organic carbon,
    which are examples of parameters frequently employed as predictors in previous
    studies (e.g., Minns et al., 2018; Snucins & Gunn, 2000). A generic multivariate
    regression model can either be linear, where all predictors are assumed to have
    a linear relationship with the response variable, or non-linear, allowing for
    more complex relationships between predictors and the response variable. In some
    cases, quadratic or higher order terms, logarithmic or exponential functions,
    or other transformations of the predictors may also be included in the model (e.g.,
    Minns et al., 2018; Sharma et al., 2008). Many studies, from regional (e.g., Livingstone
    & Lotter, 1998; Woolway, Jennings, & Carrea, 2020) to worldwide (e.g., Schmid
    et al., 2014; S. Wang et al., 2021; Winslow et al., 2018) applications, have consistently
    demonstrated a significant relationship between air and water temperatures. This
    has motivated the development of numerous simple linear regression models that
    utilize air temperature alone to predict water temperature values on a daily (e.g.,
    Bachmann et al., 2019; Matuszek & Shuter, 1996), monthly (e.g., McCombie, 1959),
    and annual (e.g., Shuter et al., 1983) basis, or to predict peak summer temperatures
    (Minns et al., 2018; Sharma et al., 2007). In deep lakes characterized by clear
    hysteresis cycles between air and water temperatures, the impact of the lake''s
    thermal inertia is addressed indirectly by estimating separate seasonal regressions
    of air-water temperature relationships for each branch of the hysteresis loop
    (M. S. Webb, 1974). Alternatively, linear regressions can be used to estimate
    monthly means of surface water temperature from monthly means of measured air
    temperature data (Lathrop et al., 2019; McCombie, 1959). In some cases, linear
    regressions are substituted by non-linear functions such as the logistic function
    that is given by: (18) where Ta is air temperature. This model has been widely
    applied in studies on stream water temperature forecasting (Mohseni & Stefan,
    1999; Piccolroaz et al., 2016; S. Zhu et al., 2018), but has also been applied
    to LSWT forecasting, (Roberts et al., 2017; S. Zhu, Ptak, Choiński, & Wu, 2020;
    S. Zhu, Ptak, Yaseen, et al., 2020). While the logistic model generally offers
    better performance compared to linear regression models for extreme upper and
    lower values, its applicability is reasonably restricted to the case of shallow
    lakes that, similar to rivers, exhibit a small thermal inertia and thus weak (or
    absent) hysteresis cycles between air and water temperatures. 4.1.3 Autoregressive
    Models In some cases, particularly when thermal inertia is high and water temperature
    reacts to air temperature changes with a damped and delayed response, autoregressive
    models that account for the previous predicted values have been used (e.g., Håkanson,
    1996; Kettle et al., 2004; Ottosson & Abrahamsson, 1998; Prats & Danis, 2019).
    For example, to estimate the hypolimnion temperature, Prats and Danis (2019) used
    an autoregressive model based on an exponential smoothing function of the epilimnion
    temperature, which in turn was modeled through an exponential smoothing function
    of air temperature based on the model proposed by Kettle et al. (2004) that is
    presented below (see Hybrid models). In this context, it is worth noting that
    second-order Markov models have been successfully employed for modeling river
    water temperature (Caissie et al., 2001; Cluis, 1972). Although such systems exhibit
    lower thermal inertia than lakes, there is potential for these models to be applicable
    in lake systems. In this type of model, water temperature is represented as the
    sum of two terms. In parallel with the Reynolds notation introduced earlier, these
    two terms can be understood as the mean annual component, denoted as , and a residual
    (or fluctuating) component, denoted as , such that . The mean annual component
    is described by a sinusoidal model of the type shown in Equation 15. The residual
    component is obtained by subtracting the actual water temperatures from the annual
    component, and this series are subsequently used to calibrate a stochastic second-order
    Markov model of the type: (19) where is the residual of air temperature with respect
    to its corresponding annual component evaluated according to a sinusoidal model
    as done for water temperature, and denotes a generic model parameter. More specifically,
    and are related to the autocorrelation coefficients for a lag of Δt and 2Δt, respectively
    (Caissie et al., 2001; Cluis, 1972), where Δt is generally assumed equal to one
    day. 4.1.4 Bayesian Models Bayesian regression models extend standard regression
    models and use Bayes'' theorem to infer the probability distribution of the parameters.
    The posterior distribution is obtained by combining the prior distribution, which
    represents our prior beliefs about the parameters, and the likelihood of the data,
    which represents the probability of obtaining the observed data given the parameter
    values. This approach allows for modeling uncertainty in the parameters and provides
    a probabilistic framework for making predictions. More specifically, the prior
    distribution represents our initial beliefs or guesses about the probability distribution
    of the model parameters before observing any data. The posterior distribution,
    in contrast, incorporates both the prior distribution and the likelihood of the
    data, resulting in an updated probability distribution of the model parameters
    that accounts for both the prior information and the information contained in
    the observed data. In general, probability distributions are built using Monte
    Carlo simulations. Bayesian modeling allows for a hierarchical approach that can
    be applied to analyze complex data structures. This approach is based on a sequential
    procedure with more than one model structure in the hierarchy, allowing for estimation
    of the parameters and prior distributions for each level using the observed data.
    In this way, each model structure builds upon the previous model''s results, incorporating
    informative priors that leverage additional sources of information and enable
    the use of past knowledge in the analysis. As an example, Christianson et al.
    (2019) implemented a sequential procedure with three models in hierarchy to predict
    sub-daily LSWT of high altitude lakes of the Southern Rocky Mountains (U.S.A).
    The first-level model described daily and seasonal variation in LSWT by combining
    sine and cosine functions and a linear term dependent on lake surface area. Here,
    vague priors were employed initially, assuming normal distributions, while in
    subsequent steps the means and covariance results from the previous model were
    utilized for all previously introduced parameters. In the second-level model,
    the effect of elevation was added to account for the wide range of variability
    of the studied lakes. Finally, the third-level model has been built on the second
    one by adding a term dependent on the year and considering an unknown sampling
    time, yielding to the full equation written below: (20) where A0 is lake surface
    area, Elev is the lake elevation, and Year is the year of observation. In this
    case, not only did the complexity of the model increase moving through the hierarchy,
    but the authors also used different data sets with increasingly larger but more
    sparse (i.e., less densely sampled in time and space) observations at each level.
    4.1.5 Machine Learning ML models are now a popular tool for water quality modeling
    (Appling et al., 2022). Studies that used ML for lake temperature modeling can
    be divided into two groups: shallow and deep ML models. The shallow ML models
    used in the literature include artificial neural networks (Di Nunno et al., 2023;
    Heddam et al., 2020; W. C. Liu & Chen, 2012; Saber et al., 2020; S. Zhu, Ptak,
    Yaseen, et al., 2020; S. Zhu et al., 2023), support vector regression (Quan et
    al., 2020), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (Yousefi & Toffolon, 2022),
    and decision trees (Heddam et al., 2020; Yousefi & Toffolon, 2022). Most deep
    ML models use recurrent neural networks, for example, long short-term memory (LSTM)
    models (X. Jia et al., 2021; Read et al., 2019; L. Wang et al., 2022; Willard,
    Read, et al., 2022; Yousefi & Toffolon, 2022) to replicate the memory of the thermal
    system. The majority of studies using ML for lake temperature prediction have
    focused on surface predictions (e.g., Di Nunno et al., 2023; Hao et al., 2023;
    Heddam et al., 2020; Quan et al., 2020; Saber et al., 2020; Sharma et al., 2008;
    Yousefi & Toffolon, 2022; Willard, Read, et al., 2022; S. Zhu, Ptak, Yaseen, et
    al., 2020; S. Zhu et al., 2023), but some have also simulated depth-resolved lake
    water temperatures (e.g., Read et al., 2019; Willard et al., 2021). Among these
    studies, Yousefi and Toffolon (2022) compared nine ML models including both shallow
    and deep models for the forecasting of LSWT and evaluated the best input predictors.
    The results showed that none of the nine ML models performed significantly better,
    and that the best input predictors are air temperature and day of the year. The
    analysis also showed that including the air temperature from previous days as
    inputs in the ML models improved prediction performance, as this helped to retain
    the historical context of the forcing conditions. ML has the potential to improve
    modeling of lake water temperature at broad spatial scales through several mechanisms.
    ML models can leverage information across thousands of lakes to improve predictions.
    Willard, Read, et al. (2022) used LSTM-based deep learning to estimate LSWT for
    185,549 lakes in the conterminous United States, and the results showed that a
    global deep learning model substantially improves predictive accuracy compared
    to a prior empirical model and a debiased process-based approach. For temperature
    profiles, Willard et al. (2021) proposed a meta-transfer learning method, which
    predicts transfer performance from candidate source models to unmonitored target
    lakes using lake attributes. This work showed that information from lakes that
    are similar (e.g., similarity in maximum depth) can be successfully transferred
    between well- and unmonitored systems, and that hybrid deep learning and process-based
    models (described in the next paragraph) transferred better than process-based
    models. An additional challenge for broad scale modeling is that process-based
    models often require information about lake characteristics (e.g., bathymetry,
    water clarity) for parameterization that are not known for most lakes. ML techniques
    are flexible where you can exclude certain parameters that are not available at
    large extents. For example, Willard, Read, et al. (2022) did not use depth or
    water clarity despite the known importance in predicting temperature across lakes.
    In fact, ML methods can be used to learn about the lake characteristics themselves
    from the observational temperature data set. For example, LSTM and inversion techniques
    have been combined to build models that can predict both dynamic lake temperatures
    and infer static features of lakes that are important for making temperature predictions
    across lakes (e.g., lake depths; Tayal et al., 2022). 4.1.6 Hybrid Models Hybrid
    0D models generally rely on the fundamental zero-dimensional heat budget Equation
    9. As shown in Equation 10 and the corresponding text, applying this heat balance
    to the well-mixed layer yields the time evolution of the water temperature averaged
    over the corresponding volume. A simplified way to account for the right-hand-side
    of the equation is through assuming that the heat flux is predominantly controlled
    by the sensible heat exchange, so that: (21) where Ta is air temperature, and
    η is a heat exchange coefficient having dimension of inverse time. This simple
    model was first proposed by Rodhe (1952) and has been applied to the Baltic Sea
    to predict the timing of ice formation, which was simply computed as the time
    when the water temperature Ts drops below 0°C. Since then, the same model has
    been used in numerous other locations, as for example, Canadian rivers, lakes,
    and bays (Bilello, 1964), Lake Mendota in USA (Robertson et al., 1992), as well
    as lakes in Greenland (Kettle et al., 2004) and other regions. In this model η
    is constant, therefore the effects of seasonality on the heat exchange coefficient
    and of stratification (i.e., varying volume in Equation 10) are neglected. Equation
    21 can be solved numerically or, as done in the aforementioned works, integrated
    over time, rearranged and solved iteratively (see Rodhe (1952) and Bilello (1964)
    for the mathematical treatment) to obtain: (22) where Δt is the integration time
    interval, normally assumed equal to one day. This equation suggests that if Ta
    is constant in time, the temperature in the surface well-mixed layer Ts tends
    to approach it exponentially. Following Kettle et al. (2004), this equation can
    be rewritten assuming that water temperature is related to air temperature through
    a smoothing function f, such that Ts(t) = f(Ta(t)), yielding to: (23) where is
    a smoothing parameter that has the effect of reducing the variance of air temperature
    and introducing a time delay in the thermal response of the lake. In this way,
    the model includes an autoregression component thus accounting for the thermal
    inertia of the lake. To enhance the model''s applicability to lakes where factors
    beyond the temperature difference between air and water may influence the system,
    an extended version incorporates theoretical short-wave solar radiation Hs as
    an additional component (Kettle et al., 2004): (24) where the term Hs can refer
    to the theoretical clear-sky radiation (see e.g., Annear & Wells, 2007 for an
    overview of models to calculate it), as proposed by the authors, be represented
    as a sinusoidal fit to average daily solar radiation data (Prats & Danis, 2019),
    or be assigned directly based on measured data. The model parameters in Equation
    24 and the smoothing parameter α are specific to each lake and should be calibrated
    by fitting the model to the corresponding observational data. In the study by
    Kettle et al. (2004), scaling relationships were discovered between these model
    parameters and lake area and maximum depth, which led to the creation of a regional
    model for predicting summer LSWT in lakes located in southwest Greenland. 4.1.7
    Equilibrium Temperature Models Edinger et al. (1968) introduced the concept of
    equilibrium temperature Teq, defined as the surface water temperature at which
    the net heat flux Hnet exchanged at the lake''s surface would be zero. The equilibrium
    temperature can be therefore calculated from Equation 1 by setting Hnet to zero,
    substituting Ts with Teq in the heat fluxes terms depending on LSWT, and solving
    for Teq. Before doing so, let us obtain the equation for Hnet by subtracting Equation
    8 in the case when Hnet = 0 and Ts = Teq, from the case when Hnet ≠ 0. This yields:
    (25) where we assumed that since the difference between Teq and Ts is generally
    small for averaging periods larger than daily, it is reasonable to assume δeq
    = δs = δ. This equation can be linearized by neglecting the second term on the
    right-hand-side, usually contributing by less than 10% of the total Hnet (Edinger
    et al., 1968; Eggers & Tetzlaff, 1978), to give: (26) where the heat exchange
    coefficient Keq in this equation is defined by the terms within the square brackets.
    With this definition of Keq, the equilibrium temperature can be computed from
    Equation 8 with Hnet = 0, by setting Ts = Teq and δeq = δ, and neglecting higher
    order terms: (27) In addition, by substituting Equation 26 into Equation 10 for
    the time evolution of Ts in the well-mixed surface layer, one obtains: (28) We
    note that this equation is formally equivalent to Equation 21 and that has the
    same meaning as the coefficient η in that equation. Hence from a mathematical
    point of view the solutions provided in Equation 22 holds true also in this case,
    once Ta and η have been replaced by Teq and ηeq, respectively. However, these
    two equations differ substantially in their physical interpretation, since in
    the latter the heat exchange between a water body and the atmosphere is proportional
    to the difference between LSWT and the equilibrium temperature, rather than the
    difference between LSWT and the air temperature. We note that the equilibrium
    temperature would be the same as the air temperature only if heat were exchanged
    solely through conduction and convection (Hnet = Hc). However, this is usually
    not the case although it is the assumption underlying the model proposed by Rodhe
    (1952), as shown above. LSWT models based on the concept of the equilibrium temperature
    are grounded in the fundamental physical principles that control the lake''s thermodynamics.
    Indeed, solving the system of Equations 27 and 28 corresponds to solving the heat
    budget of a lake, which can be done numerically by considering either constant
    or variable ηeq and Ds through time. However, in some previous applications, the
    problem has been simplified by solving Equation 28 using a sinusoidal function
    to describe Teq, obtained by fitting the values from Equation 27 using a sinusoidal
    regression (which has been proven to explain most of the variance of Teq; Livingstone
    & Imboden, 1989). This approach allowed for gaining insight on the effects of
    meteorological factors on water temperatures (Edinger et al., 1968; Livingstone
    & Imboden, 1989), and for quantifying the average and the amplitude of sub-daily
    LSWT in the form of a simple sine wave (Eggers & Tetzlaff, 1978). In some other
    applications, Teq computed according to Equation 27 or considering other assumptions
    to simplify the heat flux terms has been used as a proxy for LSWT to investigate
    the thermal sensitivity of lakes to changes in meteorological forcing variables
    (Schmid et al., 2014). 4.2 0.5D Models 0.5D models (also termed box models, according
    to the wide literature in ocean science; see e.g., Welander, 1982) are intermediate
    between 0D and 1D models, in that they model water temperature within a time-varying
    upper well-mixed layer, thus allowing for including the effect of stratification
    and vertical mixing. This type of models can be coupled with one underlying layer
    considering it decoupled from the upper well-mixed layer (as e.g., in air2water,
    Piccolroaz et al., 2013) or coupled through simple temperature-depth parameterizations
    (as e.g., in FLake, Mironov et al., 2010). Similar to 0D models, depending on
    the spatial representativeness of the data used for model calibration, 0.5D models
    can be used to model spatially-averaged or local lake water temperature. The air2water
    model is an example of a 0.5D hybrid model for LSWT prediction that combines the
    simplicity and parsimony of statistical models with the high performance of more
    complex deterministic models, thanks to its physically based derivation (Piccolroaz,
    2016; Piccolroaz et al., 2013; Toffolon et al., 2014). The model solves the volume-integrated,
    zero-dimensional heat equation applied to the well-mixed surface volume of the
    lake as described in Equation 10. In this case, the net heat flux Hnet is mathematically
    simplified through linearization using Taylor expansion and with air temperature
    serving as a proxy for the integrated effects of relevant processes and fluxes.
    The result is a simple ordinary differential equation that depends on air temperature,
    LSWT, and model parameters summarizing the main climatic and thermophysical properties
    of the lake. This equation is not fundamentally different from Equation 28 and
    reads: (29) where a1, …, a6 are model parameters and δ = Vs/Vlake = Ds/Dmean is
    the dimensionless depth (or volume) of the well-mixed surface layer relative to
    the lake mean depth Dmean (total volume Vlake). The inclusion of δ provides a
    significant advantage for air2water over purely regressive models. In fact δ is
    described by a time-dependent function that explicitly accounts for the significant
    role of vertical stratification on lake thermal dynamics: (30) where Th is the
    temperature of the hypolimnion (i.e., the deep layer, see Figure 2), which can
    be assumed equal to the minimum (maximum) surface temperature registered during
    the year for warm (cold) monomictic lakes that mix once per year, or equal to
    the temperature of maximum density (temperature of maximum density varies with
    salt content and is approx. 4°C in freshwater lakes at the atmospheric pressure)
    for the case of dimictic lakes that circulate twice a year. Although the definition
    of δ as implemented in the air2water model is empirical, the comparison between
    simulated and observed values of δ for Lakes Constance and Superior showed good
    agreement (Piccolroaz et al., 2015; Toffolon et al., 2014). Furthermore, a recent
    analysis by Toffolon et al. (2022) using a 1D physically-based model confirmed
    that δ decreases exponentially over time. However, the study suggests that a potential
    improvement could be achieved by considering different exponential decay parameters
    for the warming and cooling periods. Similarly, it has been suggested that at
    least for some lakes the model may better follow observations when Th is considered
    to be another model parameter to be calibrated, instead of being fixed as described
    above (Piotrowski et al., 2022). In addition to distinguishing air2water from
    standard regression models, the inclusion of a time-varying δ also allows this
    model to be classified as 0.5D, because it simulates the temporal evolution of
    the epilimnion. Besides the 8-parameter full model, alternative versions of the
    model also exist: one with 6 parameters, where δ equals 1 during inverse stratification
    (i.e., when Ts < Th), and another with 4 parameters where the sinusoidal term
    in Equation 29 is neglected. The first simplification was reasonable in a wide
    range of cases (Piccolroaz et al., 2013), and implies a mild effect of reverse
    stratification (i.e., parameter a7) and the possible insulating effect of ice
    cover (see the fictitious increase of delta through the term depending on parameter
    a8) on the resulting LSWT dynamics. The second simplification is particularly
    reasonable, especially when the air temperature and LSWT cycles are almost sinusoidal,
    in which case the third sinusoidal term would be redundant: the sum of sinusoidal
    functions with the same frequency but different amplitude and phase yields another
    sinusoid with different amplitude and phase but the same frequency. FLake (Freshwater
    Lake model) is another example of a widely used 0.5D lake model capable of predicting
    the vertical temperature structure and mixing conditions in lakes of various depths
    on a time scale from a few hours to many years (Mironov, 2008; Mironov et al.,
    2010). The model is based on two dynamic layers: an upper mixed layer and a thermocline
    layer in which the water temperature is parameterized using the concept of self-similarity
    of the temperature-depth curve, meaning that the characteristic shape of the temperature
    profile is conserved irrespective of the depth of this layer. The model is written
    in terms of potential water temperature Θ that is the temperature a parcel of
    water would have if it were moved adiabatically (i.e., without exchange of heat)
    to a reference pressure, normally at the surface (see e.g., Imboden & Wüest, 1995).
    According to the two-layer parameterization of FLake, the time evolution of the
    potential water temperature profile is given by: (31) where Θ = Θ(z, t), z is
    the vertical coordinate, Θs(t) and Θb(t) are the potential water temperatures
    in the surface well-mixed layer of depth Ds and at the very bottom (i.e., z =
    Dlake), and ϕ(ζ) is the dimensionless “universal” shape function describing the
    self-similar temperature profile in the thermocline. The shape function used in
    the FLake model is a fourth order polynomial in the dimensionless depth and depends
    on a shape coefficient C varying in time to account for the effect of mixed-layer
    deepening, stationary state, or retreat (Mironov, 2008). The same self-similarity
    theory is used to describe the temperature profile of the lake ice, snow, and
    active upper layer of bottom sediments. While this approach relies on “verifiable
    empiricism,” it still incorporates much of the essential physics, thus offering
    a good compromise between physical realism and computational economy (Mironov
    et al., 2010). However, because FLake does not allow for the hypolimnion layer
    below the thermocline, a virtual bottom at 40–60 m is used in simulations, instead
    of the real lake depth (Martynov et al., 2010). In FLake the upper layer is assumed
    to be well mixed and vertically uniform. The depth of this layer (Ds) is dynamically
    parameterized through an entrainment equation for the depth of a convectively
    mixed layer and a relaxation-type equation for the depth of a wind-mixed layer
    in stable and neutral stratification, as well as accounting for volumetric solar
    radiation absorption. The set of equations used in this parameterization along
    with all details for their comprehension can be found in Mironov (2008) and in
    the Appendix of Mironov et al. (2010). We refer interested readers to those previous
    studies for a detailed explanation. Although the FLake model is commonly referred
    to as a bulk model, it is classified as a box model in the classification scheme
    used in this review because the model solves for the time-dependent depth of the
    well-mixed layer. FLake has been implemented within the weather prediction model
    COSMO (Mironov et al., 2010) and coupled in one-way (Gula & Peltier, 2012) and
    two-way (Mallard et al., 2014) model configurations to the Weather Research and
    Forecasting (WRF) model, which demonstrated a good performance with respect to
    the lake surface temperature and to the freeze-up of lakes and the ice break-up.
    The interested reader can refer to the FLake model website (http://www.flake.igb-berlin.de/)
    for downloading the code and for the relevant documentation. 4.3 1D Models 1D
    models (also termed column models) allow the simulation of water temperature vertical
    profiles. 1D models can be applied either at the deepest point of a lake considering
    its hypsometric curve (variable area over depth) or, particularly when the detailed
    bathymetry is not available, on shape assumptions, for example, assuming an equivalent
    cylinder in which lakes have constant area equal to the surface area and depth
    equal to the lake''s mean depth, or a simplified cone if only surface area and
    depth are known. 1D models can be used as lake-averaged or single station models
    depending on the observations used for model calibration (i.e., horizontally averaged
    vs. local). The first case is more appropriate for small and deep lakes where
    lateral variability is less important than the vertical one. In either case, this
    should be explicitly clarified when presenting the results to avoid misinterpretations
    (Henderson-Sellers, 1984). 1D lake models are based on the assumption that mixing
    processes happen rapidly on the horizontal axis, making horizontal density gradients
    negligible. This allows the focus on the vertical axis of the water column for
    transport and mixing processes. Various criteria for the validity of the 1D assumption
    have been proposed. Generally, the 1D assumption requires a mostly stably stratified
    water column which can be validated by calculating the dimensionless Wedderburn
    number or Lake Number (Imberger & Patterson, 1989; Patterson et al., 1984). The
    Lake Number (LN) quantifies the dynamic stability of the water column and is defined
    as the ratio of the momentum of stabilizing forces (resulting from stratification)
    to the momentum of the destabilizing forces due to wind. Long periods characterized
    by LN ≫ 1 can be used as a preliminary basic validation of the 1D model assumption
    (Bruce et al., 2018) (32) where St is the Schmidt stability, β is the angle of
    the metalimnion surface to the lake bottom (that can be approximated as , where
    Dm is the depth of the thermocline and A0 is the lake surface area), u∗ is the
    wind friction velocity, and zv is the center of volume depth. While we refer to
    classical limnological textbooks for the details on the definitions of St and
    zv, we specify that the wind shear velocity u∗ can be quantified as: (33) where
    ρa and ρ are air and water density (in the latter case, the density of the surface
    water), CD is the drag coefficient for momentum, and is wind velocity measured
    at 10 m above the lake surface. Generally, the use of 1D lake models in reservoirs
    is not a common practice, especially when the geometry is intricate and marked
    by a dendritic pattern (see also Section 16). Further, the 1D assumption is generally
    valid for lakes that are not affected by the effects of Earth''s rotation on the
    internal flow field, although there are several examples of 1D lake models applied
    to large lakes (see e.g., Fenocchi et al., 2019; Gaudard et al., 2019; Goyette
    & Perroud, 2012; Piccolroaz & Toffolon, 2013; Wood et al., 2023). This can be
    verified by calculating the Rossby radius and is mostly valid for small and medium-sized
    water bodies. It should be noted that turbulence-based 1D models (see below for
    the definition), as for example, Simstrat (Goudsmit et al., 2002) and LAKE 2.0
    (Stepanenko et al., 2016) account for the effects of the Coriolis force in their
    hydrodynamic calculations and can generally be used for lakes regardless of size.
    The key equation at the basis of 1D lake models is the vertical water temperature
    transport equation. This equation can be formulated starting from Equation 14
    by focusing only on vertical processes and neglecting the vertical advection term
    to give: (34) where is the vertical eddy diffusivity (that, we recall, has a lower
    bound determined by the value of molecular diffusivity D). In this equation we
    replaced j = 3 with z, z being the depth hence defined as positive downwards,
    and omitted the overbar that denotes averaging. This equation can be rewritten
    making explicit the dominant heat source/sink terms and accounting for the lake''s
    hypsography: (35) where I(z, t) represents the internal heat generation due to
    penetrative solar radiation, Hsed(z, t) is the heat flux at the water-sediment
    interface (defined to be positive if heat flows from the sediments into the water),
    ST denotes other sink/source terms, and A(z) is the lake area. The penetrative
    solar radiation I is governed by the water clarity and, in general, is described
    through an exponential approximation of the Beer-Lambert attenuation law as follows:
    (36) where I0 = Hs,net is the available solar radiation at the lake surface and
    kd is the light extinction coefficient. It should be noted that, in general, the
    light extinction coefficient is not constant and varies as a function of the wavelength
    across the light spectrum (Bouffard et al., 2019). However, for simplicity, a
    monochromatic source is often assumed, and a constant value of kd is frequently
    empirically estimated as a function of the Secchi depth (Subin et al., 2012).
    In general, kd is on the order of 1 m−1 for turbid lakes and 0.1 m−1 for clear
    lakes (Bouffard & Wüest, 2019). In some cases, a fraction βs of the available
    solar radiation associated with wavelengths in the red end of the solar spectrum
    (wavelengths >700 nm), is allowed to be absorbed within the surface layer za.
    In such cases, Equation 36 is adjusted by defining and applying it for depths
    z ≥ za, with the component of I0 absorbed within the uppermost za layer being
    accounted for within the source term per unit volume ST. The fraction βs accounts
    for approximately 40%–50% of the total energy, which is absorbed within a surface
    layer za ∼ 0.6 m (Henderson-Sellers, 1986). We note that in shallow/clear lakes
    the portion of penetrating solar radiation reaching the bottom is absorbed in
    the top layer of sediments, although it can be partially reflected back and either
    absorbed in the layers above or released to the atmosphere, increasing the lake
    albedo (Subin et al., 2012). In order to solve Equation 35 an upper, surface boundary
    condition of the Neumann type is generally assumed with the form of: (37) where
    Hnet is the net heat flux exchange (positive when directed from the atmosphere
    toward the lake) between atmosphere and water column given by Equation 8, where
    the effects of precipitation, inflows/outflows, and water-sediment exchanges were
    excluded. The net shortwave radiation Hs,net is removed from the right-hand-side
    because, as noted above, it is already included in Equation 35 as a separate production
    term. Similarly, the contributions of precipitation, inflow/outflows, and water-sediment
    exchanges are regarded as additional source/sink terms in Equation 35. The right-hand
    side of Equation 37 includes only long-wave and non-radiative fluxes exchanged
    at the lake-atmosphere interface, which are absorbed within the uppermost 1–2
    mm of the water column (Henderson-Sellers, 1986). This thickness is smaller than
    the depth of surface layers typically considered in lake models, thus justifying
    its application as a Neumann-type boundary condition. The bottom boundary condition,
    is already introduced in Equation 35 as the term , which accounts for the water-sediment
    heat flux through approximating the water-sediment interface areas by the difference
    in horizontal areas between two consecutive depths according to the bathymetry
    of the lake (Goudsmit et al., 2002; Saloranta & Andersen, 2007). In general, this
    heat flux varies with depth and can be assigned if it is known, particularly when
    it is predominantly influenced by the upward geothermal flux (Gaudard et al.,
    2019; Piccolroaz & Toffolon, 2013), or modeled by taking into account sediment
    layers through the following heat conduction equation: (38) where λsed is the
    thermal conductivity, Tsed the temperature, and zsed the depth of the sediments
    (see e.g., the MyLake model in Saloranta and Andersen (2007)). We recall that
    the water-sediment heat flux Hsed is defined as positive when directed toward
    the water column. The effect of Hsed is often neglected (adiabatic boundary conditions
    at the sides), but it should always be considered in long-term climatic simulations
    (de la Fuente & Meruane, 2017). Ice and snow dynamics, and their impact on vertical
    heat fluxes, are mostly handled in a separate algorithm for 1D water temperature
    models. Here, more detailed descriptions of different algorithms can be found
    in H. Yao et al. (2014) and U. G. Kobler and Schmid (2019). Water temperature
    models differ in their ability to simulate a set of multiple variables, for example,
    black ice (congelation ice), white ice (snow ice) and/or snow thickness, the respective
    effects on atmosphere-water exchanges, and if ice growth can happen on top or
    below the ice-water interface. As the plethora of different ice algorithms makes
    a comprehensive description challenging, we will briefly describe the popular
    ice and snow algorithm of the MyLake model (Saloranta & Andersen, 2007) in this
    paragraph, which is also incorporated into Simstrat (Goudsmit et al., 2002) and
    GOTM (Burchard et al., 1999), which will be presented regarding their water temperature
    modeling approach in more details below. The MyLake ice and snow algorithm considers
    the dynamics of black ice, white ice as well as snow. Here, ice thickness changes
    when air temperature is below the freezing point and is quantified using Stefan''s
    law: (39) where hice is ice thickness, λice is thermal conductivity of ice, ρice
    is ice density, Lf is latent heat of freezing, Tf is water temperature at the
    freezing point (Tf = 0°C), and Tice is the temperature of the ice surface (Leppäranta,
    1993). Snow thickness is a function of precipitation, and white ice forms whenever
    the weight of snow exceeds the buoyancy capacity of the ice layer. Ice cover causes
    the surface layer to stay at constant freezing point temperatures, and heat diffusing
    into this layer is used for melting. Ice and snow thickness further affect the
    albedo regarding incoming short-wave radiation. Two prominent formulations for
    1D water temperature modeling have been established (Ford & Stefan, 1980; Perroud
    et al., 2009) based on how they simulate vertical transport. Both types of 1D
    models apply the 1D water temperature transport Equation 35 but individual models
    differ regarding their turbulent closure schemes which eventually results in different
    formulations for deriving the eddy diffusion coefficient . The first type estimates
    eddy diffusivity coefficients based on empirical or physically-based relationships.
    These models include integral energy models (also called mixed-layer models) as
    well as eddy-diffusion models. The other type are turbulence-based models that
    use additional equations to quantify turbulent transport of turbulent kinetic
    energy (TKE, k) and of its rate of dissipation (ɛ) (Rodi, 1984). In most cases,
    integral energy models apply the TKE by wind shear directly to calculate the mixed
    layer depth without focus on vertical transport of TKE (Ford & Stefan, 1980).
    The transport below the mixed layer depth is modeled solving Equation 35 with
    estimated using empirical relationships, mostly based on parameterizations related
    to the gradient Richardson number defined as the ratio between local gradients
    of buoyancy (stabilizing) and shear (causing turbulent mixing): (40) where u is
    the horizontal velocity, N is the Brunt-Väisälä or buoyancy frequency , and S
    represents local shear (note that the vertical coordinate z is defined as positive
    downwards). In a simple form, the eddy diffusivity can be related to buoyancy
    effects as: (41) where is the diffusivity at neutral stratification (Ri = 0),
    b and c are empirical coefficients that vary across a wide range according to
    the several relationships available in the literature (Henderson-Sellers, 1982;
    Munk & Anderson, 1948; Pacanowski & Philander, 1981). An example is the approach
    following Henderson-Sellers (1985), in which turbulent diffusivity is also parameterized
    based on the gradient Richardson number, see Equation 40, and is used to quantify
    vertical mixing over the full vertical axis (e.g., in the so-called Hostetler-type
    models, after Hostetler and Bartlein (1990)). This turbulent diffusivity model
    does not estimate a mixed layer depth from the external available kinetic energy
    and can be classified as eddy-diffusion model. It differs from turbulence-based
    models as it does not use additional calculations to account for turbulent energy
    production and dissipation. Therefore, methodologically and technically, models
    sensu Henderson-Sellers (1985) are closer to integral energy models than turbulence-based
    models. On the other hand, turbulence-based models quantify directly the production,
    transport and dissipation of TKE along the entire water column and have thereby
    a mechanistic basis for analyzing vertical turbulent transport and shear. Two-equation
    turbulence models like the k − ɛ model or the Mellor-Yamada model relate the TKE,
    k, to its dissipation rate, ɛ, using a characteristic length scale (42) and thereby
    introducing two additional equations for calculating the 1D water temperature
    transport (Burchard & Baumert, 1995; Burchard et al., 1998; Rodi, 1987). Several
    1D lake models have been proposed by the scientific community, including widely
    used modeling software such as Advanced Lake Biogeochemistry Model (ALBM, Tan
    et al., 2015), DYnamic REservoir Simulation Model (DYRESM, Imberger & Patterson,
    1981; Yeates & Imberger, 2003), General Lake Model (GLM, Hipsey et al., 2019),
    General Ocean Turbulence Model (GOTM, Burchard et al., 1999), the Hostetler model
    (Hostetler & Bartlein, 1990), LAKE 2.0 (Stepanenko et al., 2016), Multi-year Lake
    simulation model (MyLake, Saloranta & Andersen, 2007), Simstrat (Gaudard et al.,
    2017; Goudsmit et al., 2002), CLM4-LISSS (Subin et al., 2012), LAKEoneD (K. Jöhnk
    & Umlauf, 2001; K. D. Jöhnk et al., 2008), MINLAKE96 (Fang & Stefan, 1996), Weather
    Research and Forecasting-Lake (WRF-Lake, Gu et al., 2015), and customized lake
    models developed for investigating specific lakes conditions, for example, deep
    ventilation due to thermobaric instability (Piccolroaz & Toffolon, 2013), temperature
    patterns in turbid lakes (Fukushima et al., 2022). All these 1D modeling tools,
    see also F. Wang et al. (2019) for a similar list, provide lake-averaged projections.
    GLM, MyLake, and MINLAKE96 are examples of integral energy models in which the
    depth of the mixed layer is determined, and then the available external kinetic
    energy is compared to the internal potential energy of the water column to entrain
    denser water into the mixed layer (although specific formulations of the integral
    energy comparison vary, see i.e., Ford and Stefan (1980)). Integral energy models
    assume that the mixed surface layer is a perfectly mixed slab with constant temperature
    over depth and are based on early works of bulk mixed layer depth assumptions
    by for example, Kraus and Turner (1967). Generally, the external amount of TKE
    in such models mostly represents the external wind shear stress, but can also
    include convective overturn, shear production between layers and Kelvin-Helmholtz
    billowing (see Hipsey et al. (2019) for such an implementation). For surface layer
    mixing to occur, the TKE budget must be higher than the potential energy in the
    water column which is needed to lift up denser water from below the mixed layer
    and into the newly formed mixed layer, as well as in some formulations to account
    for the energy consumption by previously mentioned Kelvin-Helmholtz billowing.
    In other words, the lake is divided into a series of layers that are successively
    mixed downward until the available TKE is no longer sufficient to mix the next
    deeper layer. As an example for an integral energy scheme, we highlight here the
    approach sensu Herb and Stefan (2004) (neglecting the effects of the macrophyte
    vegetation reducing wind mixing) which is based on MINLAKE96. The external kinetic
    energy per unit area KE is parameterized based on surface wind velocity as: (43)
    where τ is surface turbulent shear stress, is surface shear velocity, and Δt is
    the model time step. Potential energy PE at layer i (with the reference at the
    surface) is: (44) where zi is the mean depth of the ith layer, zcm is the center
    of mass of the mixed layer, and Δρ is the density change from the mixed layer
    to the layer i + 1 (Herb & Stefan, 2004). At each model time step, the depth of
    the mixed layer is iteratively calculated until the condition PEi+1 > KE is met.
    All these models apply an empirical parameterization of the eddy diffusivity,
    , related to buoyancy effects and therefore to the Brunt-Väisälä frequency to
    model mixing below the mixed layer, hence in the thermocline: (45) (46) GLM uses
    the Weinstock derivation which relates the eddy diffusivity to water column stability
    and rate of turbulent dissipation, in which CHYP is a constant coefficient for
    the mixing efficiency, ɛTKE is a simplified approximation of turbulent dissipation
    rate based on the dissipation by inflows and wind, kTKE is the turbulence energy
    containing wavenumber, and u∗ is the wind shear velocity (Weinstock, 1981). We
    note that in GLM, kTKE is empirically parameterized based on lake morphometry
    and stratification (Hipsey et al., 2019). MyLake and MINLAKE96 relate the eddy
    diffusivity to an empirically measured relationship of diffusivity values to the
    buoyancy frequency, where ak is a parameterization of the lake surface area (Hondzo
    & Stefan, 1993). WRF-Lake, ALBM, and the Hostetler model are examples of models
    based on the previously mentioned formulation after Henderson-Sellers (1985) which
    can be considered as eddy-diffusion-based models. The depth of the surface mixed
    layer is not calculated directly from external KE but solved for solely through
    turbulent diffusion, in which the eddy diffusivity coefficient is related to the
    gradient Richardson number, and employing a mixing scheme to adjust water temperature
    instabilities by mixing instantaneously and recursively adjacent water layers
    until the temperature difference is less than a small specified-value: (47) where
    κ is the von Karman''s constant, σt,0 is the neutral value of the turbulent Prandtl
    number (normally assumed equal to 1 according to the Reynolds analogy), and k∗
    is a latitudinally dependent parameter of the Ekman profile (see also Hostetler
    and Bartlein (1990)). k∗ can be quantified as: (48) where ϕ is the latitude of
    the lake, and U2 is wind speed 2 m above the water surface. The turbulent Prandtl
    number is defined as: (49) where νz is the kinematic eddy viscosity along the
    z direction. Simstrat, LAKE 2.0, LAKEoneD, and GOTM are examples for turbulence-based
    models that apply the k − ɛ two-equation turbulence model to quantify production,
    transport and dissipation rates of TKE. These type of models add two more equations
    of the general form: (50) (51) in which k and ɛ are related to the turbulent diffusivities
    of TKE and TKE dissipation ( and , respectively), the TKE production due to shear
    (P), and the production and dissipation of TKE related to buoyancy (B) (Goudsmit
    et al., 2002; Rodi, 1984). The empirical constants cɛ,1, cɛ,2, and cɛ,3 are fitted
    using field or experimental data. The eddy viscosity can be calculated as , where
    cμ is an empirical coefficient based on flow experiments (Rodi, 1984). In the
    standard k − ɛ model, the eddy diffusivity coefficient is related to the turbulence
    kinetic energy k and dissipation rate ɛ through the turbulent Prandtl number σt,
    which was introduced earlier: . Similarly, and , where σk and σɛ are model constants
    (Goudsmit et al., 2002). According to the Reynolds analogy, the turbulent Prandtl
    number σt is typically assumed to be equal to in neutrally stratified environments.
    On the other hand, in stable stratification environments, it may be a calibration
    parameter (Boegman et al., 2001) or a function of the Richardson number (Venayagamoorthy
    & Stretch, 2010). These four highlighted 1D turbulence-based models all apply
    a fixed numerical grid with the grid layers having a constant thickness over the
    course of a simulation. Turbulence-based models may also include the horizontal
    velocity components over the vertical axis through which they account for the
    effects of the Coriolis force on the vertical flow field. Because turbulence-based
    models have a mechanistic representation of momentum as well as production and
    dissipation of TKE, they can be used to directly compare model projections with
    measured quantities of TKE and shear stress. This enables them to have a greater
    generality than integral energy models which rely on specific assumptions about
    how external TKE affects the heat budget inside the water column. Due to their
    low computational costs and the availability of long-term monitoring data typically
    measured at a lake''s deepest site, vertical 1D water temperature models are prominently
    used for lake modeling. Their main applications are regarding physical limnological
    investigations, for example, projecting changes in lake mixing and stratification,
    quantifying vertical heat transport, guiding lake and reservoir management, and
    investigating the thermal habitat of different species. A typical application
    is to use 1D lake models in projecting climate change effects on lake systems
    (e.g., Ayala et al., 2020; Fenocchi et al., 2018; U. G. Kobler & Schmid, 2019;
    Magee & Wu, 2017; Moras et al., 2019; Piccolroaz & Toffolon, 2018; Robertson &
    Ragotzkie, 1990; Woolway, Jennings, et al., 2021; Wood et al., 2023), as, due
    to low computational costs, they can project long-term effects in a low time frame.
    Their application for climate change projections is especially advisable as 1D
    lake models can sufficiently replicate the dynamics of lake systems regarding
    stratification, ice formation and mixing compared with higher dimensional models
    (Ishikawa et al., 2022), and upscaling is technically feasible due to low computational
    demands. 1D lake models are also frequently used to evaluate the effect of meteorological
    extreme events on in-lake mixing and heat transport (e.g., Bueche et al., 2017;
    Mesman et al., 2021; Perga et al., 2018; Shinohara et al., 2023). Further, 1D
    lake models are frequently used for quantifying heat and mass transport in water
    bodies and therefore to infer and adapt water management (e.g., Barbosa et al.,
    2021; Ladwig et al., 2018; Mi et al., 2018; Olsson, 2022; Soares et al., 2019;
    Weber et al., 2017). Also, important ecological information like the thermal habitat
    or the solubility of gases can be inferred from the vertical distribution of water
    temperature (e.g., Butcher et al., 2015; Magee et al., 2019). 1D water temperature
    models can be easily coupled, or in some cases are already internally coupled,
    to aquatic ecosystem models (AEM3Ds) to project changes in water quality and ecosystem
    dynamics (e.g., Andersen et al., 2022; Kong et al., 2023; Ladwig, Hanson, et al.,
    2021; Salk et al., 2022). In most cases, there is a one-way coupling between the
    thermodynamics and the AEM3D, in which the projected vertical diffusivity coefficient
    is used to infer the transport of water quality variables. Two-way couplings exist,
    notably when the light attenuation by dissolved and particulate matter is projected
    from the water quality model and fed-back to the thermodynamic model for calculating
    the internal heat generation. 4.4 2D and 3D Models 2D models are used to simulate
    lake transects (length-depth), typically, but not necessarily, lying along the
    longitudinal and lateral directions of a curvilinear coordinates system. This
    type of model is particularly suitable for application in fjord lakes, deep-valley
    reservoirs, and elongated lakes in general (e.g., Kim & Choi, 2021; Lindenschmidt
    et al., 2019; Mi et al., 2020; Ulloa et al., 2022). Besides temperature and other
    scalars, 2D models normally solve also the bi-dimensional flow field. One of the
    most widely used 2D models is the CE-QUAL-W2 model, which is a longitudinal/vertical
    hydrodynamic and water quality model developed and maintained by US Army Corps
    of Engineers and Portland State University (Cole & Wells, 2006). The model is
    laterally averaged, assuming that lateral variations in velocities, temperatures,
    and constituents are negligible. For this reason, it is best suited for relatively
    long and narrow water bodies characterized by longitudinal and vertical water
    quality gradients. The CE-QUAL-W2 model uses fixed computation grids with a static
    bathymetric surface onto which longitudinal segments and vertical layers are mapped,
    and the hydrodynamic and water temperature computations are performed at the intersections
    of these segments and layers. The model user can choose among several different
    turbulence closure schemes, ranging from Richardson number based parameterizations
    to the k − ɛ model, the latter being the turbulence closure recommended by the
    developers. These models quantify the eddy vertical viscosity νz, which is then
    used to calculate the vertical thermal eddy diffusivity assuming a default constant
    value of the turbulent Prandtl number σt = 7. The value of σt = 7 is commonly
    accepted for laminar flows in freshwater. However, previous sensitivity analyses
    of the CE-QUAL-W2 model have shown that optimal values for this parameter are
    smaller, as expected in turbulent flows where the parameter approaches unity (Boegman
    et al., 2001). The model also requires the definition of a horizontal diffusion
    coefficient, which, according to the approach proposed by Okubo (1971), is linearly
    proportional to the lateral grid spacing through a coefficient. 3D models are
    utilized to reconstruct the full thermo-hydrodynamics of a lake. These models
    are commonly used in large water bodies or when a detailed simulation of specific
    processes is required. Like 2D models, 3D models simulate not only temperature
    and other scalar values but also the flow field, resulting in the most physically
    realistic and complete simulation of the processes occurring in a water body.
    Parallel to a better representation of the processes, also the complexity, computational
    cost, and data requirements increase compared to simpler models. Several 3D models
    are used to simulate the thermodynamics of lakes, many of which are also used
    in the oceanography community. Delft3D, an open-source integrated modeling suite
    (Deltares, 2023), is an example widely used by limnologists. It simulates two-dimensional
    flow (in either the horizontal or vertical plane) and three-dimensional flow (through
    the Delft3D-FLOW module), as well as sediment transport, morphology, waves, water
    quality, and ecology through other specific modules of the modeling suite. This
    model has been successfully applied in several physical and ecological lake studies
    (e.g., Amadori et al., 2021; Guo et al., 2023b; Schwindt et al., 2023; Soulignac
    et al., 2019) and is at the basis of an online platform providing lake observations
    and three-dimensional numerical simulations in near real-time with short-term
    forecasts and data assimilation (Baracchini, Wüest, & Bouffard, 2020). Another
    example is MITgcm (Massachusetts Institute of Technology General Circulation Model,
    Adcroft et al., 1997), whose hydrodynamic kernel is used to drive both atmospheric
    and oceanic models and that includes physical and biogeochemical parameterizations
    of key atmospheric and oceanic processes. This model has been recently applied
    also to lake modeling (e.g., Safin et al., 2022). The ELCOM model (Estuary and
    Lake COmputer Model, Hodges et al., 2000), adapted from the TRIM model (Casulli
    & Cheng, 1992) with the inclusion, among the other modifications, of a mixed-layer
    turbulence closure, is another well-known 3D hydrodynamics model that has been
    widely applied for simulating processes in lakes and reservoirs. ELCOM is often
    coupled with the biogeochemical model Computational Aquatic Ecosystem DYnamics
    Model (CAEDYM, Hamilton & Schladow, 1997), the coupled model being known as (AEM3D)
    and being used for water quality analyses including water temperature and stratification
    forecasting (Lin et al., 2022). Finally, among many others here we mention Environmental
    Fluid Dynamics Code (EFDC, Hamrick, 1992) that can be used to simulate aquatic
    systems in 1D, 2D, and 3D and has been applied to simulate thermal structures
    and dynamics in many lakes worldwide (e.g., Arifin et al., 2016; Hui et al., 2018;
    Khazaei et al., 2023; Y. Li et al., 2010). Compared with the above discussed 1D
    and 2D models, 3D models are closer to reality as they can model the thermal dynamics
    in the longitudinal, lateral, and vertical directions. However, they need more
    computational efforts due to their higher complexity and, in principle, require
    spatially distributed forcing variables to impose the boundary conditions and
    spatially distributed observations for their validation. In fact, the proper assessment
    of any 3D lake model would require a comparison of simulated and observed velocity
    fields at several locations. However, even 3D models may produce unrealistic scenarios,
    especially when the calibration of their parameters was improperly or unsuccessfully
    conducted (Schwindt et al., 2023). Moreover, available measurements are often
    limited to water temperature profiles and velocity measurements are generally
    scarce or absent, thus limiting the application of 3D models. In some cases, however,
    in absence of velocity measurement a consistent reproduction of the 3D lake dynamics
    may be tempted, by distilling information across diverse spatial and temporal
    scales from a heterogeneous set of water temperature data alone (Amadori et al.,
    2021). In absence of sufficient information or computational power required to
    run a 3D model, lower dimensionality models can be used to obtain quasi-3D simulations
    (see Figure 6). For example, the CE-QUAL-W2 model can be applied in a quasi-3D
    manner by discretizing the computational domain into different branches. This
    approach is particularly useful when modeling dendritic lakes, which is typical
    of reservoirs with several side arms (Cole & Wells, 2006). Likewise, there are
    examples of 1D models applied in a spatially distributed domain thus obtaining
    a so-called multi-column lake model, which can be assumed as a quasi-3D representation
    of a lake (e.g., Gaillard et al., 2022; Martynov et al., 2010; Subin et al., 2012;
    Sugiyama et al., 2018). This approach does not allow for the simulation of the
    lake''s hydrodynamics and hence of horizontal heat advection but has been proven
    to be a good (and more economic) alternative to full 3D models to simulate the
    horizontal and vertical spatial thermal patterns of large lakes over seasonal
    time scales (Gaillard et al., 2022). Also 0D and 0.5D models can be applied in
    a distributed framework to obtain 2D and 2.5D representation of a lake, respectively,
    in terms of horizontal spatial patterns of LSWT, in the second case including
    the estimate of the well-mixed layer depth (see e.g., Calamita et al., 2021).
    5 Model Performance 5.1 Performance Metrics To evaluate the performance of environmental
    models, including water temperature models, a large number of performance metrics
    has been proposed in the literature. The most used performance metrics span from
    standard residual criteria, to correlation and model efficiency measures, and
    are summarized in Table 2. For other common performance metrics we refer the interested
    reader to previous reviews specifically focused on presenting these metrics with
    their strengths and weaknesses (Bennett et al., 2013; Moriasi et al., 2007). Likewise,
    we refer to the work by Hipsey et al. (2020) for a comprehensive list of performance
    metrics specifically tailored to the case of aquatic ecosystem modeling, which
    includes a section dedicated to physical models of aquatic systems. In that study,
    the authors proposed a four levels framework for model validation, combining:
    conceptual accuracy (Level 0), state accuracy (Level 1), process accuracy (Level
    2), and accuracy in capturing system behavior (Level 3). The conceptual validation
    of a model is a needed prerequisite (Level 0) that is implicitly ensured when
    developing a new model, but often taken for granted when applying an existing
    model. Process validation (Level 2) and system validation (Level 3) are seldom
    undertaken (Hipsey et al., 2020) as they require richer available data sets than
    are generally available; the comparison of simulated state variables with observations
    (Level 1) is the predominant approach available in the literature (Hipsey et al.,
    2020). Examples of higher validation levels may include model performance metrics
    to assess the simulated heat fluxes and turbulent mixing intensity within the
    water column against for example, turbulence measurements (Level 2) or the simulated
    water age and eddy structures against estimates from geochemical tracers and thermal
    satellite images, respectively (Level 3). These higher levels of model validation
    are restricted to 1D/2D models (Level 2) and 3D models (Level 3). Table 2. List
    of the Most Used Performance Metrics (See e.g., Bennett et al., 2013; Hipsey et
    al., 2020 for Additional Metrics and Further Details) Name Formula Notes Mean
    Error (ME) or Bias Calculates if the model over/underestimates observations. Values
    close to zero does not necessarily indicate low error due to cancellation Mean
    Absolute Error (MAE) Similar to ME except absolute values are used instead. It
    is not affected by cancellation Mean Square Error (MSE) Similar to ME but in data
    units squared. It is not affected by cancellation and squaring the data penalizes
    more higher error values Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) The squared root of MSE.
    It facilitates interpretation since it is in the same data units. Often referred
    to as Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) Absolute Maximum Error (AME) Indicates
    the largest error Mean Relative Mean Error or Bias (MRME) Relative equivalent
    of ME. This metric increases the weighting of errors related to low measurement
    values. The same normalization approach is commonly applied to MAE. ϵ is a small
    value to avoid division by 0 when Oi = 0 Normalized Mean Error or Bias (NME) Normalized
    equivalent of ME. Normalization can be obtained also dividing by the standard
    deviation or range of variability of observations. The same normalization approach
    can be applied to MAE, MSE and RMSE Correlation Coefficient (Corr or r) Pearson
    correlation coefficient, which measures the linear correlation of the observed
    and modeled values. The squared of the Pearson correlation coefficient is called
    coefficient of determination (r2) and estimates the fraction of the variance in
    O that is explained by M in a simple linear regression Nash Sutcliffe Efficiency
    (NSE) A normalized statistic that evaluates the relative magnitude of the residual
    variance compared to the observed data variance (Nash & Sutcliffe, 1970). NSE
    = 1 indicates perfect fitting while NSE = 0 indicates that the model performs
    as accurate as the mean of the observed data. NSE <0.5 is associated to unsatisfactory
    performance (Moriasi et al., 2007). When is substituted with the climatological
    year, we refer to the modified version NSE*, which is especially useful in the
    presence of significant seasonal patterns Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) A
    metric that weights the RMSE based on the N number of observations used in calibration
    and k number of model parameters. AIC is aimed at finding the most parsimonious
    model and preventing over-fitting (Akaike, 1974) Bayesian Information Criterion
    (BIC) Similar to AIC (Schwarz, 1978) Note. The terms Mi and Oi indicate simulated
    and observed values, respectively; i = 1, …, N indicates time index and N is the
    total number of observations; the bar symbol ( and ) refers to the time average
    of the time series. Level 1 validation is generally undertaken by direct comparison
    of time-series of water temperature. The vast majority of cases use point measurements
    or vertical profiles, but more recently, LSWT derived from satellites have been
    used to evaluate the horizontal performance of 3D models (e.g., Amadori et al.,
    2021; Baracchini, Chu, et al., 2020; Mao & Xia, 2020) and 2D multi-box models
    (Calamita et al., 2021). In some cases, the limitations of using point measurements
    with low spatial representativeness can be alleviated by distilling the information
    across multiple temporal scales (typically from hourly to seasonally, depending
    on the frequency and duration of the time series) using wavelet analysis or other
    signal decomposition strategies and comparing the power spectra resulting from
    observations and simulations (e.g., Amadori et al., 2021; Kara et al., 2012).
    Likewise, the informativeness of vertical temperature profiles can be used beyond
    direct comparison of predicted and observed values by comparing derived indices
    of thermal stratification intensity such as the Schmidt stability (e.g., Bruce
    et al., 2018) or the Lake Number, or indicators of stratification phenology such
    as the mixed layer and thermocline depths (e.g., Bayer et al., 2013; Bruce et
    al., 2018), stratification onset and break-up (e.g., Woolway, Sharma, et al.,
    2021), or ice cover duration (e.g., Piccolroaz, Zhu, et al., 2021). This approach
    partially accomplishes a Level 2 model validation. When assessing model performance
    using observed temperature profiles, we recommend evaluating depth-specific or
    layer-specific metrics in addition to the metrics calculated for the entire profile,
    which is the common standard. To properly interpret the model errors relative
    to the depth-specific variance of observations, we also suggest using normalized
    model efficiency performance criteria such as NSE (see Table 2 for the definition
    of all performance metrics). For instance, the same residual error in the epilimnion,
    which is typically characterized by larger observational variance, or in the hypolimnion,
    which is typically associated with much smaller variance, does not have the same
    meaning and if not normalized it may lead to incorrect conclusions (Amadori et
    al., 2021; Feldbauer et al., 2022; Wood et al., 2023). The usefulness of evaluating
    depth-specific metrics clearly emerges from Figure 7 (that will be discussed in
    more detail in Section 24), where for the 1D lake model GLM has a similar RMSE
    in the epilimnion or in the hypolimnion (around 0.75–0.80°C at 5 and below 20
    m depth) is associated to different NSE values (around 0.97 and <0.93, respectively).
    We note that for metrics such as ME, MAE, MSE, and MRME the overall values obtained
    considering all the available data correspond to taking the average of the depth-specific
    metrics, if the sample sizes at different depths are the same. When assessing
    the performance of a model in simulating time series with prominent seasonal patterns,
    such as LSWT, it may be preferable to use NSE* instead of NSE (see Table 2) to
    better understand how well the model captures dynamics that are not part of the
    seasonal component (Piccolroaz et al., 2016; Schaefli & Gupta, 2007). In this
    case, it is worth noting that NSE* = 1 indicates perfect model fitting, just like
    NSE. However, NSE* = 0 implies that the model performs as well as assuming the
    mean year of measurements, which is different from NSE = 0 that indicates the
    model performs as well as assuming the mean observed value. Figure 7 Open in figure
    viewer PowerPoint Depth-specific distribution of some key performance metrics
    for the 1D models the General Lake Model, General Ocean Turbulence Model, and
    Simstrat, obtained over a 2-year period in Lake Feeagh (Ireland) utilizing the
    R package LakeEnsemblR. The values of the same metrics evaluated using all the
    available data are also shown (vertical lines). Please refer to Table 2 for a
    detailed explanation of the metrics used. Particularly when evaluating the performance
    of 0D and 0.5D statistical or hybrid models, it is recommended to use information
    theory and the corresponding scores to rank models based on a trade-off between
    goodness of fit and model parsimony (i.e., number of model parameters, see Table
    2). The main examples of these scores are the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC,
    Akaike, 1974) and the Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC, Schwarz, 1978). These
    information criteria have been successfully adopted in several studies (e.g.,
    Piotrowski et al., 2021; Toffolon et al., 2022; Woolway, Sharma, et al., 2021).
    However, we note that the choice of the performance metric may not be sufficient
    to evaluate the reliability of a model to predict the investigated processes.
    It must be coupled with appropriate calibration procedures that are appropriate
    for the model and for the physical processes that are approximated by the model
    (Triana et al., 2019), as is further discussed in the next section. The degree
    to which a model is validated depends on the choice of the number and type of
    performance metrics to be adopted. This choice is often guided by the background
    and experience of the modeler and is not immune from a general desire to report
    favorably on the performance of the model (Hipsey et al., 2020). This subjectivity
    and possible bias in model validation could be overcome by the adoption of assessment
    standards based on universally accepted performance criteria, which however is
    still lacking but is highly desired to facilitate inter-comparison of different
    model approaches. An unspoken rule that seems to be tacitly accepted by modelers
    is the combined use of multiple performance metrics. In fact, each performance
    metric generally measures only specific aspects of a model''s performance thus
    single performance criterion may lead to counterproductive or biased results such
    as favoring models that do not reproduce important features of a system (Bennett
    et al., 2013). 5.2 Calibration/Optimization Methods The majority of computational
    models in different fields of science have some parameters that need to be calibrated/optimized,
    hereafter referred to as optimized, often by fitting them to empirical-based data.
    There are, however, contradictory conceptual, or ideological, approaches to optimization.
    According to some researchers, optimization is merely a technique to make the
    model empirically adequate, even if it does not necessarily make it reliable for
    making predictions of any kind (Oreskes et al., 1994). Although such an approach
    may seem ideologically tempting at first, it is empirical confirmation that allows
    scientists to trust any theory or model. For example, the lack of empirical confirmation
    makes some fundamental issues, like the theoretical discussion on the existence
    of multiverse (Ellis, 2008) or on the real existence of pure mathematical objects
    (Abbott, 2013) at best on the edge of science. Although optimization of models
    can limit the validity of the research that is made using such models, fitting
    some model parameters to empirical data is often unavoidable and makes a process-driven
    model a semi-empirical model (Gupta et al., 2006). However, existing literature
    provides evidence that enhancing the realism of a model can, in some cases, diminish
    the necessity for extensive model calibration (e.g., Gharari et al., 2014; Guinot
    & Gourbesville, 2003). There are generally four main ways to perform optimization
    of water temperature models. Some prefer manual calibration, in which user modifies
    the values of parameters based on expert knowledge. Although this approach is
    still sometimes recommended (Yu et al., 2022), it can be highly inefficient in
    terms of both time needed and effects obtained. Nonetheless, manual calibration
    is frequently used for computationally demanding, 2D (Diogo et al., 2008; Ishikawa
    et al., 2022; Zouabi-Aloui et al., 2015) and 3D (Castelletti et al., 2010; Hodges
    & Dallimore, 2001; Hui et al., 2018; B. Martin et al., 2013; Missaghi & Hondzo,
    2010; Preston et al., 2014; Soulignac et al., 2017) thermo-hydrodynamic lake or
    reservoir models. The other approach is using gradient, or second-order derivative-based
    algorithms (Battiti, 1992; Levenberg, 1944), which are often fast and accurate
    in finding the local optimum. However, such algorithms generally converge to the
    closest local solution and require the model to be differentiable; both issues
    pose important limitations for lake water temperature models. The examples of
    application of such algorithms include mainly ML tools (Saber et al., 2020; S.
    Zhu, Ptak, Yaseen, et al., 2020). The third group of methods is composed of so-called
    metaheuristic optimization algorithms (Del Ser et al., 2019), which are optimization
    algorithms inspired by natural or artificial systems to fine-tune model parameters
    and achieve an optimal fit to observed data, and can be applied for calibration
    of almost any kind of lake water temperature models (e.g., Afshar et al., 2011;
    Piccolroaz et al., 2013; Piotrowski et al., 2022; Shabani et al., 2021; Xia et
    al., 2021; Yousefi & Toffolon, 2022; S. Zhu et al., 2021). The use of metaheuristic
    algorithms in calibrating environmental models is encouraged in Maier et al. (2019).
    Finally, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms (Andrieu et al., 2010; Braak,
    2006; Vrugt et al., 2013) that iteratively generate samples of parameter values
    from a probability distribution, are mainly used for calibration of 3D models
    (e.g., Hipsey et al., 2019; Safin et al., 2022). Some early LSWT modeling studies
    claim that water temperature models may not need calibration to each specific
    lake, as their parameters are relatively easily generalized to different water
    bodies (Hondzo & Stefan, 1993). For example, generalizations may be made based
    on links between model parameters, location and bathymetry of the lake (Fang &
    Stefan, 2009). However, studies on large numbers of lakes have shown that the
    lack of lake-specific calibration decreases the performance of water temperature
    model simulations (Read et al., 2014). Recently, lake-specific features were used
    to transfer trained process-guided deep learning models of water temperature from
    observed to unobserved systems via a meta-model (Willard et al., 2021). This work
    highlights the flexibility of deep learning to leverage information across lakes,
    but also confirms the importance of lake features in the prediction of lake water
    temperature at broad scales. Currently, most lake water temperature models are
    being calibrated for each specific case. In our opinion, model calibration methods
    should be explicitly described, as previous studies showed that the choice of
    calibration method may be a crucial factor affecting the performance of lake water
    temperature modeling (Piotrowski et al., 2023; S. Zhu et al., 2021). The choice
    of the calibration method should always depend on the model and user requirements
    (Maier et al., 2019; Osaba et al., 2021; Weise et al., 2012). If the objective
    function is differentiable and the problem is unimodal (or have a few local optima
    with solutions of similar quality), gradient-based methods are a good choice.
    If the problem is not differentiable, but low-dimensional and its fitness landscape
    have a simple shape, one may try manual calibration. If the problem may have many
    local minima of diverse quality, metaheuristics or MCMC algorithms should be used.
    Specifically, when one wants to address the problem of parameter uncertainty,
    MCMC are often the best options. When a single solution is to be found for a highly-dimensional
    model, metaheuristics are the advisable tools. Other factors that should be taken
    into account include computational complexity (computationally demanding models
    may require gradient-based methods or surrogate-based heuristics Jin (2011), see
    also Xia et al. (2021) for a case focused on limnology) and the number of objectives
    (if one wants to fit the model to more than one criteria, multi-objective algorithms
    are needed). There are also some technical points that are often neglected, but
    may highly affect the final outcome of the calibration procedure. First, one has
    to repeat calibration of the model a number of times because most calibration
    algorithms are stochastic in the sense that they include some randomness in their
    operators. As a result, two different simulations may produce two different results,
    hence a number of simulations is needed to summarize the quality of solutions.
    Additionally, even if the calibration procedure is purely deterministic, if the
    model is not unimodal (hence have more than a single optimum), the solution finally
    found may depend on the location of the initial solutions. Again, multiple simulations
    from different initial solutions is needed. After performing a number of simulations,
    some statistics on the quality of solutions should be reported. The importance
    of repeated simulations has been pointed out in the optimization literature (Vecek
    et al., 2017), but also in limnological research (Yousefi & Toffolon, 2022). The
    second important technical point that needs to be addressed in calibration is
    the careful choice of the algorithm''s control parameters. It is often overlooked
    that nearly every calibration algorithm has its own set of control parameters,
    and some of these parameters can significantly affect performance. The simplest
    example is population size in evolutionary algorithms (Eiben et al., 1999; Piotrowski
    et al., 2020), but various kinds of control parameters exist in almost any optimization
    algorithm, including MCMC, metaheuristics, and gradient-based techniques. Before
    running an algorithm one should decide whether to use the “classical” (e.g., suggested
    by the authors of the particular procedure) control parameters, or perform pre-tuning
    (C. Huang et al., 2020). Pre-tuning is advisable for a novel application of particular
    optimizer, but as tuning is computationally demanding, in most cases authors prefer
    to rely on the suggested control parameters. However, this may lead to sub-optimal
    performance of the method if the recommendations were produced using a different
    use-case. The third technical issue to consider when calibrating lake temperature
    models relates to the stopping criteria that are to be used for the algorithm.
    In the case of gradient-based methods, these are rather simple to set, but for
    metaheuristics or MCMC methods the choice of stopping conditions is more subjective
    and may highly affect the results (e.g., Even-Dar et al., 2006; Piotrowski et
    al., 2017; Sergeyev et al., 2018). Modelers should ensure the computational time
    allowed for the optimizer would be sufficient to find solutions of appropriate
    quality, otherwise the performance of the calibrated model may be affected. Finally,
    it should be remembered that developing the universally “best” calibration method
    is impossible (Wolpert & MacReady, 1997), and that the performance of various
    algorithms may highly differ for the specific problem. For a more general guide
    on the application of optimization algorithms, we refer the interested readers
    to Handberg and Campante (2011), Weise et al. (2012), Shahriari et al. (2016),
    Maier et al. (2019), Osaba et al. (2021), and Ma et al. (2023) for more details.
    6 Emerging Modeling Approaches and Future Directions 6.1 Forecasting Forecasting
    of water quality and ecological variables is needed for projecting future changes,
    validating our modeling tools and informing water management (Dietze et al., 2018).
    There has been a recent focus on either near-term or seasonal forecasts of water
    temperature. Thomas et al. (2020) developed the real-time iterative water temperature
    forecasting system Forecasting Lake and Reservoir Dynamics (FLARE) which consists
    of a data assimilation procedure and an ensemble-based forecasting algorithm to
    create 16-day forecasts of water temperature (using GLM) with uncertainty. A near-term
    forecasting study on six lakes across the United States revealed that the accuracy
    of water temperature forecasts depended on lake depth as well as water clarity
    (Thomas et al., 2020). Recently, the National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON)
    Ecological Forecasting Challenge created an open-data framework to advance theory
    in ecology by near-term forecasting of ecological variables, including water temperature
    (Thomas et al., 2022). There are also examples of near-term forecasting applications
    including data assimilation that use 3D hydrodynamics models in large lakes, that
    is, Lake Geneva (Baracchini, Wüest, & Bouffard, 2020) or Lake Erie (Lin et al.,
    2022). In both cases, the simulations results are published on user-friendly data
    visualization web-platform open the public and are expected to support governmental
    agencies in charge of the water resources management and policy making (see http://meteolakes.ch
    and https://coastlines.engineering.queensu.ca/). For seasonal forecasts, Mercado-Bettín
    et al. (2021) used GLM and GOTM for two lake systems to explore how temperature
    forecasts vary across different hydrologic models and climate input data. Clayer
    et al. (2023) further coupled these lake models with hydrological models forced
    with seasonal meteorological forecast ensembles to provide probabilistic predictions
    of seasonal anomalies in lake water temperature and ice-off. The concept of using
    forecasting to improve modeling theory can be an opportunity in water temperature
    modeling to improve existing algorithms and compare alternative model concepts
    (A. S. Lewis et al., 2022; Carey et al., 2022). 6.2 Digital Twins A digital twin
    is a virtual representation of a physical “real” lake. The concept of a digital
    twin is commonly applied in other fields like water resource management and hydrology
    (e.g., Henriksen et al., 2023; Ramos et al., 2023; Rigon et al., 2022), but has
    not been extensively applied to lakes. As part of the Digital Earth (X. Li et
    al., 2023), the digital twin of lakes has the potential to be a strategic resource
    for decision-making, enabling timely interventions that can yield improved results.
    For instance, it can assist in assessing the impact of climate change on lake
    thermal dynamics and identifying feasible mitigation measures. To develop a digital
    twin for the study of lake thermal dynamics, four foundational elements are needed:
    (a) the physical twin, namely the lake itself, (b) data sets, which includes all
    available observations, (c) the digital twin, which includes one or more lake
    models with access to the data sets and modeling results to support well-timed
    decision-making; and (d) incorporation of decision-support tools, which include
    visualization capabilities and customizable digital interfaces. With the development
    of the digital twin of lakes, we can further answer “what if” questions, for example,
    what if the lake experiences extreme events (e.g., heatwaves) or human-induced
    alterations (e.g., selective withdrawals)? How will this impact the lake thermal
    dynamics (e.g., stratification and mixing) and water quality? What can be done
    to mitigate the negative impacts? Engaging in the creation of digital twin models
    for lakes represents a strategic and pioneering approach with promising prospects
    for scientific advancement. 6.3 Combining Process-Based Modeling With Deep Learning
    ML models are more flexible compared to process-based models as they do not require
    the mathematical structure that represents physical processes. Though ML models
    have proven their efficiency and accuracy in lake water temperature modeling (see
    the literature cited in Section 6), they lack clear physical meaning, which can
    lead to poor performance when predicting in out-of-bounds conditions such as future
    climate scenarios or in the large majority of lakes that are rarely or never monitored.
    To overcome this issue, coupling ML models (e.g., deep learning) with theory (physical
    laws) in various model architectures and methods have been proposed (Willard,
    Read, et al., 2022). For example, Read et al. (2019) proposed a hybrid modeling
    framework for the prediction of lake water temperature profiles. Three aspects
    of knowledge or theory were included in this modeling framework: temporal awareness
    in the form of an LSTM, enforcement of physical laws through model penalties when
    predictions violated conservation of energy, and pretraining with simulated water
    temperature from a process-based model. These methods have been shown to outperform
    process-based models and pure deep learning methods (Read et al., 2019; X. Jia
    et al., 2021). These and other hybrid models have led to the emergence of a new
    modeling approach often referred to as Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning (KGML),
    in which deep learning neural networks and physics-based models are combined to
    leverage their complementary strengths and improve the modeling of physical processes
    (Appling et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2023; X. Jia et al., 2019; Willard, Jia, et
    al., 2022). Furthermore, ML has the potential to assist in calibrating process-driven
    models and identifying the aspects or algorithms that may be lacking in these
    models. 6.4 Evaluating Structural Model Differences Through Ensemble Modeling
    Water temperature modeling studies routinely compare the predictions and performance
    of different models (e.g., Heddam et al., 2020; Sharma et al., 2008; Yousefi &
    Toffolon, 2022; S. Zhu, Ptak, Yaseen, et al., 2020). For example, Yousefi and
    Toffolon (2022) compared nine ML models including both shallow and deep ones for
    the forecasting of LSWT, and the results showed that none of the nine ML models
    clearly prevails. In a recent study, Di Nunno et al. (2023) demonstrated that
    ensemble models, created by stacking multiple ML algorithms, can enhance the predictive
    performance of individual ML algorithms when forecasting LSWT. Likewise, Almeida
    et al. (2022) compared the prediction capabilities of FLake and the Hostetler
    models in reproducing LSWT against a ML algorithm in 24 reservoirs where temperature
    dynamics are substantially affected by inflows/outflows. They found that ML models
    may outperform process-based physical models in terms of both accuracy and computational
    cost when long-term observations were available. However, because these inter-comparisons
    were conducted on a limited number of lakes/reservoirs, they could not claim which
    modeling approach was the best. This is particularly true considering that, generally
    speaking, the choice of the best model depends on the specific process at hand
    and results from a compromise between model performance, data requirements, and
    computational cost. Furthermore, the performance of any model relies on the user''s
    knowledge of the model and ability to calibrate or train it. However, it is challenging
    for scientists to be experts in the implementation of every model. Therefore,
    it is advisable to approach model comparison studies with caution in this regard.
    Ensemble modeling is the state-of-the-art technique to conduct structural model
    comparison studies of 1D process-based models and evaluate the uncertainty around
    future projections. An early ensemble modeling initiative was the LakeMIP project
    which was initiated in 2008. During the first phase, several 1D models were compared,
    including a completely mixed model, FLake, Hostetler, CLM4-LISSS, MINLAKE96, LAKE,
    Simstrat, and LAKEoneD. The models were evaluated by using data from a shallow,
    turbid lake in Germany. The results showed that all eight models generally captured
    diurnal and seasonal variability of LSWT reasonably well. However, some models
    were not able to realistically reproduce temperature stratification in summer
    (Stepanenko et al., 2013). Further, Stepanenko et al. (2014) compared five of
    the eight models (FLake, CLM4-LISSS, LAKE, LAKEoneD, and Simstrat) in a small
    boreal lake and Thiery et al. (2014) compared seven of the eight models in a large,
    deep tropical lake. These ensemble modeling studies improved the ability to project
    future water temperature and thermal structure of lakes at global or regional
    scales, while further improvement is still needed to better serve the community
    regarding the impact of climate change on lake ecosystems (e.g., water quality,
    lake biogeochemistry). An emerging issue of ensemble modeling is that the computational
    implementation is quite challenging and time-consuming in case of setting up and
    running multiple lake models as emphasized in Soares and do Carmo Calijuri (2021),
    which might need better cooperation within the scientific community. To facilitate
    and ease the use of ensemble modeling, and to create a common framework for ensemble
    modeling of 1D process-based lake models, the R package LakeEnsemblR was developed
    by Moore et al. (2021). Users of LakeEnsemblR can run ensembles of 1D lake models
    (FLake, GLM, GOTM, Simstrat, MyLake) from the same input data, and the results
    are compiled in a single output file (Moore et al., 2021). Example ensemble studies
    include the evaluation of a lake''s physical properties (Lake Kinneret, Israel)
    using an ensemble of 1D hydrodynamic lake models (Gal et al., 2020); an ensemble
    of vertical 1D hydrodynamic lake models used to calculate water temperature, stratification,
    and ice cover for the reservoir Lichtenberg in Germany (Feldbauer et al., 2022);
    and the impact of increased winter salt loads on spring overturn and summer stratification
    evaluated using an ensemble approach (Ladwig, Rock, & Dugan, 2021). As an example,
    we used LakeEnsemblR to simulate the thermal structure of Lough Feeagh (Ireland)
    over a period of 2 years. The lake has a surface area of 3.9 km2, a surface elevation
    of 11 m, a mean depth of 14 m, and a maximum depth of 46 m. The results are shown
    in Figure 7 for the three 1D lake models GLM, GOTM, and Simstrat, and refer to
    the calibration period running all models on an hourly time step. Figure 7 illustrates
    the distribution of various performance metrics throughout the water column, showcasing
    the evaluation of each metric at specific depths. We also calculated the same
    metrics across all depths (red lines in Figure 7) to emphasize the importance
    of considering depth-specific metrics to better understand the strengths and weaknesses
    of each model (see Section 18 and Table 2 for a detailed explanation of each metric).
    Overall, both methods of calculating performance metrics lead to similar conclusions
    for this lake: (a) Simstrat outperforms GLM and GOTM, (b) GLM exhibits lower overall
    performance with the highest error at the depth of the metalimnion but also overall
    smaller performance differences between the epilimnion and hypolimnion, (c) Simstrat
    and GOTM clearly demonstrate a decline in performance in the hypolimnion compared
    to the epilimnion. Generally, model performance degrades the further a grid cell
    is located away from the surface boundary conditions. Especially integral energy
    models (i.e., GLM) have shortcomings replicating heat transport at the location
    of the highest density gradient, hence the metalimnion. In this example, turbulence-based
    models (i.e., GOTM and Simstrat) performed better at the metalimnion, but their
    performance deteriorated in the hypolimnion. A framework for ensemble modeling
    of climate change impacts on lakes worldwide has been established through the
    lake sector initiative in the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project
    (ISIMIP, Golub et al., 2022). The framework included 11 lake models and observed
    data for lakes worldwide, which permits lake thermal studies at a global scale.
    The ISIMIP results highlighted the potential impacts of future climate change,
    such as increased summer stratification periods (Woolway, Sharma, et al., 2021),
    a global future increase in methane production (Jansen et al., 2022), a decrease
    of winter ice thickness in lakes in the Northern hemisphere (Grant et al., 2021),
    increased future intensity of heatwaves acting on the lake surface (S. Wang et
    al., 2021), and the magnitude of global heat uptake in inland waters (Vanderkelen
    et al., 2020). Multi-lake-model simulations are increasingly used to obtain robust
    assessments of freshwater ecosystem responses to climate change. A key challenge
    for understanding historic and future change in the thermal structure of lakes
    is to quantify the contribution of natural versus human-induced external forcing.
    With large ensemble simulations (i.e., a set of projections starting from different
    initial conditions but produced with a single model and identical external forcing),
    the human-induced and naturally varying variations in lake temperature can be
    quantified (Deser et al., 2020). Most notably, using large ensembles, one can
    investigate the anthropogenic and natural variability components of lake temperature
    changes, enabling (a) identification of the anthropogenic signal itself and (b)
    a timescale over which such changes will emerge over natural variability (Woolway
    et al., 2022). Recent studies have highlighted the benefit of using large ensemble
    simulations to investigate lake ice responses to natural and anthropogenic drivers
    (L. Huang et al., 2022), but future studies could also consider evaluating lake
    temperature responses to climate change within a large ensemble. 6.5 Adaptive
    Water Management In reservoirs, the transport of mass, dissolved or suspended
    compounds, and overall energy is affected by the presence of a dam. Upstream-downstream
    transfers of water mass and properties, including water temperature, is often
    complex to quantify and to model due to the existence of withdrawals, diversions
    and inflows. Selective withdrawals, for example, are structures allowing the release
    of water from different depths in the reservoirs and are used to meet downstream
    water temperature and, more generally, water quality targets and mitigate undesirably
    warm or undesirably cool peak events (i.e., thermopeaking). A common way to operate
    a selective withdrawal system is by releasing warmer water from a shallower depth
    to mitigate the impact of cold and abrupt peak flow during the period of hydropower
    generation in summer compared to the case of a fixed hypolimnetic withdrawal,
    which is the most common situation (Kim & Choi, 2021). Another more sophisticated
    alternative is to modulate the use of the different withdrawals distributed along
    the water column during the year, which can relieve the impact of climate warming
    on downstream river water temperatures in summer and the consequent decline of
    cold water species'' habitats but at the cost of warmer stream temperatures in
    winter (Rheinheimer et al., 2015). In any case, a proper design of a selective
    withdrawal system requires knowledge of depth-specific thermal dynamics of the
    reservoir, which can be obtained with one of the modeling tools discussed above
    (in many previous studies the 2D lake model CE-QUAL-W2 has been used). The modeling
    of selective withdrawal not only allows to optimize its operation to meet the
    downstream temperature targets but provides a quantification of the impact of
    these operations on stratification, mixing, and water flow in the reservoir, which
    have obvious implications for its ecology and environment. Some research suggests
    that a deep withdrawal decreases the strength of summer stratification, thus improving
    oxygen availability and reducing the accumulation of nutrients in the hypolimnion
    (Duka et al., 2021; U. Kobler et al., 2018) (note that e.g., Weber et al., 2017
    highlighted how withdrawal from the epilimnion on the other hand strengthened
    thermal stratification and decreased hypolimnetic oxygen availability). However,
    complexities of the reservoir regulation scenarios make this finding difficult
    to generalize. The different types of control structures (e.g., stoplog gate,
    temperature-control curtain; He et al., 2023), and the peculiarities of each hydropower
    network, are often complicated by the presence of a cascade of reservoirs (H.
    Wang et al., 2023) or pumped-storage plants (U. Kobler et al., 2018). The release
    of water from a reservoir (e.g., for power generation, dam spills) can cause the
    displacement of fish from the reservoir, a process known as fish entrainment.
    Fish entrainment can directly result in injury or death of individuals, as well
    as reduce the abundance of upstream populations and increase the abundance of
    downstream populations (Coutant & Whitney, 2000). The seasonal temperature stratification
    and fish habit use of the reservoir result in different entrainment vulnerability
    for fish species. Recommendations were provided for the reservoir operators to
    maximize operations while mitigating and compensating for fish entrainment. In
    this respect, lake modeling is a valuable tool to support the design and operation
    of reservoirs characterized by selective withdrawals and pumped-storage plants,
    which could be considered when carrying out environmental impact assessments for
    an effective management of the water resources. 6.6 Coupling of Climate and Lake
    Models To investigate the impact of climate change on the thermal dynamics of
    lakes, it is essential to couple climate and lake models, which can be achieved
    through one-way or two-way coupling. In one-way coupling, time series of climate
    variables that are relevant for lake thermal dynamics, such as air temperature,
    are extracted and used as inputs for the lake model to simulate future lake thermal
    conditions (see e.g., Fang & Stefan, 1996; Gula & Peltier, 2012; Mi et al., 2020;
    Sterckx et al., 2023). In one-way coupling, downscaled meteorological forcing
    from global circulation or regional climate models is often required, which can
    be obtained using various methods available in the literature, such as the change
    factor method (Piccolroaz, Zhu, et al., 2021), empirical-statistical approaches
    (Gutiérrez et al., 2019), and deep learning methods (Baño Medina et al., 2022).
    Our ability to understand future lake conditions has improved as climate modeling
    and downscaling techniques have improved in recent decades (Alizadeh, 2022). However,
    large uncertainty remains in some future climate features (e.g., precipitation)
    that will impact lake thermodynamics (Alizadeh, 2022; Lopez-Cantu et al., 2020).
    Further, it is important to recognize that while connecting lake temperature models
    to climate projections can help us understand future lake conditions, both data-driven
    and process-based models can perform poorly when trying to predict in previously
    unseen conditions (e.g., Sungmin et al., 2020). One advantage of data-driven models
    is their flexibility to incorporate and learn from a wider range of data that
    might help inform the model on how lakes might respond to future change (e.g.,
    data from multiple lakes across latitudes that might represent future conditions).
    Carefully considering evaluation criteria and model setup is critical for predicting
    responses to climate change (Madsen et al., 2014). While one-way coupling is the
    simplest and most widely used approach, it only considers the impact of climate
    change on lake thermal dynamics and does not account for feedbacks from lakes
    to the atmosphere. As a result, important interactions between the two systems
    may not be captured. Two-way coupling solves this issue by fully integrating the
    climate and lake models, enabling the feedback impact of lake thermal processes
    on regional climate to be considered (Guo et al., 2022; Mallard et al., 2014).
    A typical example of two-way coupling is given by the models sensu Henderson-Sellers
    (1985), and other examples have been implemented in the Community Land surface
    Model (CLM-Lake) (Oleson et al., 2013), Common Land Model (CoLM-Lake) (Dai et
    al., 2018), Community Earth System Model (CESM-LISS) (Lawrence et al., 2019; Subin
    et al., 2012), and the Weather Research and Forecast model (WRF-Lake) (Gu et al.,
    2015). Two way coupling has been widely used to study lake/reservoir thermal dynamics,
    lake ice coverage, lake–atmosphere interactions, and climate change effects on
    lakes (see e.g., Guo et al., 2022, 2023a; Gu et al., 2015; F. Wang et al., 2019;
    Wu et al., 2020; X. Wang et al., 2023; Xiao et al., 2016). Another example is
    the FLake model, which has been coupled in one-way with ERA40 reanalysis data
    (Martynov et al., 2010) and WRF (Gula & Peltier, 2012), and incorporated as a
    lake parameterization scheme into the Consortium for Small-scale Modeling—COSMO
    model (Mironov et al., 2010) and coupled in two-way model configurations with
    WRF (Mallard et al., 2014). FLake and Hostetler models have been successfully
    coupled with the Canadian Regional Climate Model—CRCM5, demonstrating that considering
    lakes in simulated climate can have a significant impact, as shown by comparing
    multi-decadal simulations with and without lakes. The models have performed well
    in simulating temperate subgrid lakes and large shallow lakes, especially for
    FLake (Martynov et al., 2012). However, the performance of both 1D lake models
    in large deep lakes has been relatively poor due to the lack of representation
    of 3D processes such as upwelling and downwelling, horizontal circulation, and
    thermal bar formation. In this regard, efforts have been made in the last decades
    to fully couple 3D lake models with climate models for regional studies, especially
    because large and deep lakes exhibit substantial seasonal lags in temperature
    and fluxes compared to other landscapes (León et al., 2007). Multi-column 1D lake
    models for example, based on Hostetler (Notaro et al., 2013) and Simstrat (Gaillard
    et al., 2022), have been proposed as computationally-efficient alternatives to
    full 3D lake models. Multi-column models consider 1D flat-bottom columns distributed
    spatially across a 2D domain and neglect horizontal heat and mass transport, thus
    achieving a first level spatially-resolved representation of 3D thermal dynamics.
    However, recent studies in the Great Lakes region have overcome these limitations
    by proposing a two-way coupled 3D lake-ice–climate modeling system called the
    Great Lakes-Atmosphere Regional Model, which significantly outperformed previous
    coupled 1D simulations (Xue et al., 2017). This system has also been used to provide
    high-resolution ensemble projections of climate change, highlighting its potential
    for regional climate studies (Xue et al., 2022). 7 Conclusions This review offers
    a valuable resource for scientists working in limnology and hydrology who seek
    to understand lake water temperature modeling and its potential applications.
    It provides an overview of the subject matter and highlights important considerations
    for future research and application, making it useful for both seasoned modelers
    and those new to the field. The review covered the physics governing thermal dynamics
    in lakes, different sources of observational water temperature data, available
    lake water temperature models, model performance evaluation, and emerging modeling
    approaches. Based on our analysis we identified some key areas that future efforts
    could prioritize, including improving forecasting capabilities also through the
    development of digital twins of lakes, evaluating lake water temperature responses
    to climate change using large ensemble models and advancing toward two-way coupling
    between 3D lake and climate models, and adopting universally accepted performance
    criteria for model assessment and inter-comparison of different model approaches.
    Overall, this review emphasizes the importance of mathematical modeling as an
    essential tool for understanding how various factors, including climate change,
    affect lake thermal dynamics and related processes. Acknowledgments SP acknowledges

  description: Providing adequate water supply to the growing number of urban residents
    will be a challenge faced by many utility managers throughout the remainder of
    this century. Though traditionally, water managers have looked toward supply-based
    solutions (e.g., expanding reservoirs), recent trends indicate a shift toward
    demand-side management (e.g., encouraging conservation behaviors). Here, we present
    an agent-based model (ABM) that simulates water supply as a function of the local
    climatic conditions and water consumption, which is, in part, determined based
    on water conservation attitudes. Our results indicate the ABM performs well (normalized
    root mean squared error <10%) for the study area. Further, we explore various
    hypothetical demand management scenarios by changing the water conservation attitudes
    of the households (i.e., the archetypes). This scenario testing reveals a statistically
    significant improvement to water availability after successfully changing water
    conservation attitudes to be more participatory. Ultimately, this study aims to
    understand the nuances of water conservation attitudes and aid utilities in their
    goal to better manage urban water demand.

    The research article titled "Simulating socio-hydrological responses to climatic
    conditions in Phoenix, Arizona" by Renee Obringer and Dave D. White presents an
    agent-based model (ABM) that simulates how water supply is affected by local climate
    conditions and water consumption patterns in the city of Phoenix. The model considers
    various climate variables (precipitation, temperature, evaporation, streamflow)
    and household water consumption, which is influenced by water conservation attitudes
    and behaviors. Using data from a household survey conducted in Phoenix, the ABM
    categorizes households into seven archetypes based on their water conservation
    attitudes and quantifies their water consumption accordingly. The model calculates
    the change in water storage over time based on the water balance equation, accounting
    for water inputs and outputs from the system. The authors evaluate the model performance
    by comparing the simulated water supply with historical observations and report
    high accuracy with low error rates, indicating that the model is a reliable representation
    of the water system in Phoenix.


    **Relevance Evaluation**


    **This article is highly relevant to the point raised in the review outline, which
    focuses on providing user-friendly interfaces for farmers to input preferences,
    constraints, and expert knowledge into automated irrigation systems using techniques
    like participatory design or user-centered design.** The ABM developed in this
    study addresses the broader context and intent of the literature review by demonstrating
    how household water consumption patterns can be influenced by water conservation
    attitudes and how these attitudes can impact the overall water supply system.
    Although the model does not directly simulate farmer behavior or the use of automated
    irrigation systems, it provides a framework for understanding how user preferences
    and behaviors can affect water resource management, which is essential for the
    development and implementation of user-friendly interfaces for automated irrigation
    systems. The insights gained from this study can inform the design of interfaces
    that effectively engage farmers and facilitate their participation in water management
    decisions.

    six months from publication: . SECTIONS PDF TOOLS SHARE Abstract Providing adequate
    water supply to the growing number of urban residents will be a challenge faced
    by many utility managers throughout the remainder of this century. Though traditionally,
    water managers have looked toward supply-based solutions (e.g., expanding reservoirs),
    recent trends indicate a shift toward demand-side management (e.g., encouraging
    conservation behaviors). Here, we present an agent-based model (ABM) that simulates
    water supply as a function of the local climatic conditions and water consumption,
    which is, in part, determined based on water conservation attitudes. Our results
    indicate the ABM performs well (normalized root mean squared error <10%) for the
    study area. Further, we explore various hypothetical demand management scenarios
    by changing the water conservation attitudes of the households (i.e., the archetypes).
    This scenario testing reveals a statistically significant improvement to water
    availability after successfully changing water conservation attitudes to be more
    participatory. Ultimately, this study aims to understand the nuances of water
    conservation attitudes and aid utilities in their goal to better manage urban
    water demand. Research Impact Statement Working to change water conservation attitudes
    to be more participatory positively impacts the long-term water availability for
    the City of Phoenix. 1 INTRODUCTION Globally, water resources are under increasing
    stress (Krueger et al., 2019; Rodell et al., 2018; Wada et al., 2014). Part of
    this stress is caused by consistently high agricultural demand and rising municipal
    demand (Hanasaki et al., 2013; Hejazi et al., 2013; Wight et al., 2021). Additionally,
    climate change is reducing the availability of water for people and nature in
    certain areas (AghaKouchak et al., 2015, 2021; Hejazi et al., 2013; Vörösmarty
    et al., 2000). This combination of increased demand and limited supply has made
    water management one of the most pressing challenges facing society today. Traditionally,
    water management has focused on supply-side solutions to address water stress,
    such as building (or expanding) reservoirs, developing new surface water supplies,
    or extracting groundwater (Di Baldassarre et al., 2018). Under conditions of uncertainty,
    complexity, and climate non-stationarity, water managers and policy makers are
    augmenting these strategies by emphasizing conservation and demand management,
    increasing water use efficiencies, and enhancing water recycling and reuse. Contemporary
    water management aims to better integrate natural and social systems. To this
    end, socio-hydrological systems research has advanced, reflecting and informing
    new approaches in policy and management (Gain et al., 2020; Gober et al., 2017;
    Pande & Sivapalan, 2017). A key tenet of socio-hydrological systems research is
    the idea that people can have an impact on the hydrological system through their
    own consumption patterns (Garcia et al., 2016; Sivapalan et al., 2014). Many socio-hydrological
    models fall into one of two categories—(1) static models that look at a single
    “snapshot” of the system, thus assuming that the relationships are stationary,
    and (2) dynamic models that account for these changing relationships. Both types
    of modeling have advantages and disadvantages. For example, many static models
    are able to account for large spatial and temporal extents and tend to be more
    computationally efficient. Static models often leverage statistical techniques
    such as regression (Ashoori et al., 2016; Ramsey et al., 2017; Rasifaghihi et
    al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020), although recent work has shifted toward the use
    of more complex machine learning models (Obringer et al., 2022; Obringer & Nateghi,
    2018; Wongso et al., 2020). These studies have provided critical information on
    understanding the relationship between water systems (both supply and demand)
    and the prevailing climatic conditions. However, as they are static models, they
    are built on the assumption that relationship between the water system and the
    climate will remain stationary, which is unlikely given the ongoing climate crisis
    and the projected population growth in many parts of the world (Milly et al.,
    2008). Conversely, dynamic modeling, including the use of agent-based models (ABMs),
    can account for these changing relationships, while also accounting for more extreme
    climatic events, population growth, and policy changes. Early ABMs in water systems
    research evaluated changes to water consumption based on economics and community
    characteristics (Athanasiadis et al., 2005; Zellner, 2007), as well as consumer
    behavior (Darbandsari et al., 2017; Giacomoni et al., 2013; Kanta & Zechman, 2014).
    These latter studies tend to define consumer behavior in binaries (e.g., agents
    either conserve water or they don''t), which is not representative of the complex
    and varied behaviors surrounding water consumption and conservation in modern
    cities, particularly in drought-prone areas, such as the southwestern United States
    (U.S.). Recently, there have been several studies that focus on modeling consumption
    in the Colorado River Basin, primarily due to the ongoing issues related to overallocation
    of the river and prolonged droughts in the region (Murphy et al., 2019; Sampson
    et al., 2022) In particular, Sampson et al. (2022), developed an ABM to simulate
    changes in future water demand in Denver, Colorado, under various scenarios of
    land use. The authors found that increased urban irrigation efficiency could reduce
    demand by 5%–25% over baseline, equivalent to increased urban housing density.
    Other studies have sought to define water demand by quantifying indoor and outdoor
    use to evaluate the feedback loop between water consumption and water supply (Berglund,
    2015; Chu et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2021). The water consumption is quantified
    based on a variety of climatic, socioeconomic, and end-use variables, but the
    attitudes toward water conservation are rarely included. Given that recent works
    have shown that attitudes and social norms can confound predictive models, leading
    the overpredictions of total water use (Obringer et al., 2022), excluding these
    critical social variables could be leading to misrepresentations of the water
    system and feedback loops within the system. There have been a few ABMs that focused
    on modeling consumer attitudes and perceptions (Galán et al., 2009; Hyun et al.,
    2019; Wens et al., 2019). However, much like the studies that model consumer behavior,
    these attitudes are often assumed to be binary. Galán et al. (2009), for example,
    modeled agent attitudes as either environmentalist or non-environmentalist. This,
    however, ignores the range of attitudes that users may adopt, which will subsequently
    impact their water consumption. Thus, there is a need to leverage a more comprehensive
    set of possible attitudes in order to better understand how water availability
    is impacted by the actions that stem from these attitudes. While the studies discussed
    above have demonstrated the impact of water consumption on the water system, there
    remains significant knowledge gaps related to the characterization of households.
    Specifically, many ABMs characterize households based on demographics or housing
    characteristics (e.g., household income, lot size, etc.), with little emphasis
    on attitudes, values, or beliefs that may impact conservation behavior. These
    models are missing the nuances that are present within modern-day societies, and
    therefore are at-risk of misrepresenting the water system they seek to model.
    Here, we present an ABM that adopts a more nuanced approach to defining agents.
    Using results from a household survey conducted across three metropolitan areas
    in the Colorado River Basin, we consider households to belong in one of seven
    archetypal groups that have different attitudes toward water conservation and
    participation in conservation programs (see White et al., 2019 and Obringer &
    White, 2023 for information on the survey and archetypes). This work aims to fill
    the gap related to the lack of water conservation attitudes in ABMs, while also
    providing nuanced insights into the role of household decisions on the larger
    water system. In the following sections, we describe the study area and the methods,
    which follow the ABM protocol developed by Grimm et al. (2010) and further expanded
    upon by Grimm et al. (2020). Then, we show the results from our model as well
    as a discussion surrounding possible scenarios of changing attitudes. Finally,
    we wrap up with the conclusion and possibilities for future work. 2 STUDY AREA
    To test the capability of our attitude-based ABM, we selected the city of Phoenix,
    Arizona, as the study area. Phoenix is a fast-growing city in the southwestern
    U.S. Both local and state authorities are working to reconcile growth with limited
    water resources. In fact, Arizona and the southwestern U.S. have been beset by
    a decades-long megadrought, which may be the driest 22-year period in 1200 years
    (Williams et al., 2022). This has led to the city to pursue a range of water conservation
    measures to maintain the existing supply levels. The city of Phoenix has a long
    history of adapting to its desert climate and limited local water availability.
    The city sources water from hundreds of miles away, including the Colorado River,
    as well as local supplies from the Salt-Verde River system. About 20% of the city''s
    water supply is sourced from the Colorado River, via the Central Arizona Project
    (CAP). Through the CAP, water is withdrawn from Lake Havasu and moved through
    190 miles of canals to reach the cities of Phoenix and Tucson. Another 50% of
    the water supply is obtained through the Salt River Project (SRP), which obtains
    water from the Salt and Verde Rivers that originate in northern and eastern Arizona.
    The SRP manages about 130 miles of canals, which they use to move water throughout
    their service area, including the city of Phoenix. This reliance on long-distance
    water transfers make Phoenix vulnerable to both local and regional droughts, including
    droughts that originate in the upper Colorado River Basin. As such, the city has
    begun to focus on demand management to make the most of their limited water supplies.
    At present, the Colorado River Basin is experiencing one of the worst droughts
    on record, leading to reductions in water level across the basin (Udall & Overpeck,
    2017; Williams et al., 2022). Along with local droughts, the basin-wide issues
    are putting stress on Phoenix as well as Arizona as a whole. While the city may
    choose to implement various demand management strategies, such as incentivizing
    the switch to drought-tolerant landscaping or mandatory water use restrictions,
    there is no guarantee that people will act to conserve water. The act of conserving
    may depend more on resident''s attitudes toward water conservation, which would
    ultimately impact the efficacy of demand management programs. This has motivated
    the current study, in which we seek to model the role of consumer attitudes on
    the water system. 3 METHODS In this section, we described the ABM that has been
    developed. Specifically, we have outlined the model following the Overview, Design
    concepts, and Details (ODD) protocol (Grimm et al., 2010, 2020). 3.1 Model purpose
    The specific purpose of this study is to model the impact of water conservation
    attitudes on the larger water supply system. Previous work has shown that attitudes
    do impact water consumption (Brownlee et al., 2014; Straus et al., 2016; Wolters,
    2014), meaning that they can be used to evaluate the potential success of various
    interventions. The goal of this model, therefore, is to include the role of water
    conservation attitudes within a socio-hydrological system model to be of use to
    management entities seeking to encourage water conservation through interventions.
    We envision a model that can be used to evaluate various policies and interventions
    while considering the various attitudes held by residents within a given service
    area. The model discussed herein is the first step toward this goal, in which
    we focus solely on evaluating the impact of water conservation attitudes with
    limited scenario testing. To evaluate this model, we will compare the modeled
    water supply to the actual water supply, seeking to match the pattern as closely
    as possible. 3.2 Entities, state variables, and scales The primary entities in
    our model are the agents, which represent households in the city of Phoenix (n = 400,000).
    The agents use water, which ultimately adds to the total water consumption and
    impacts the water supply in the area. Additionally, there is an environment entity
    that tracks the passage of time within the simulation as well as the various climate
    variables used to calculate the water supply. The main state variable attributed
    to the agents is the archetype. The archetypes were determined through a previous
    analysis using a clustering technique (Obringer & White, 2023). Specifically,
    there are seven archetypes for consumer attitudes toward water conservation (see
    Supporting Information for further details). Using a formula developed by Wang
    et al. (2021), we were able to extract the distribution of water consumption for
    each archetype. The agents are then randomly assigned an archetype based on the
    proportion of the observed archetypes, which then allows the agents to draw from
    a specific distribution of water consumption values. In the environment, state
    variables include the streamflow, precipitation, evaporation, and storage, which,
    when combined with the total water consumption, are used to calculate the change
    in storage over each time step. These variables are based on historical observations
    in the study area. Further description of these variables can be found in Table
    1. TABLE 1. Environmental input data used in our model. All variables are daily
    measures. Variable Units Source Minimum Median Maximum Precipitation inches NCEI

    The spatial scale for the model is the city of Phoenix. In theory, however, the
    model could be applied to several other areas, provided the data was available.
    Temporally, the model is run on a daily scale over the course of 10 years (2010
    through 2019). 3.3 Process overview and scheduling The aim of this model is to
    investigate the impact of water conservation attitudes on the overall water supply.
    As such, the main processes in the mode involve extracting historical data on
    environmental conditions and calculating the water consumption, before calculating
    the change in storage. The following actions are performed at each time step:
    1. The environment extracts historical data for precipitation, evaporation, streamflow,
    and losses. 2. The agents draw their water consumption value from the distribution
    that corresponds to their archetype and the season (winter, summer, or intermediate
    months). 3. The environment calculates the total water consumption. 4. The environment
    calculates the change in storage through a water balance equation, using the historical
    environmental conditions and the calculated water consumption. 5. The display,
    output files, and storage variable are updated. In essence, the model uses the
    historical observations and the total water use of all the agents to determine
    the change in storage compared to the previous time step. The storage variable
    is initialized at the beginning of the process based on the historical data, but
    after that, it changes based on the model input. The historical values for the
    storage are maintained for comparison. The distribution of water consumption was
    determined prior to the model run. To do this, we leveraged an equation developed
    by Wang et al. (2021) to calculate water consumption for each respondent from
    Phoenix in the survey (n = 792). Then, we fit gamma distributions to each of the
    archetypes to determine their possible water consumption values. The gamma distribution
    only allows for positive values, which is important for water consumption research,
    where negative values are physically not possible. Moreover, gamma distributions
    are good at capturing right-skewed data in which there are a few large values
    and many small values. Water consumption often follows this pattern, with a few
    users that consume a lot of water, while the majority of users consume much less
    than the maximum. It should be noted, however, that the equations developed by
    Wang et al. (2021) only considered socioeconomic and climatic variables. In order
    to account for the impact of attitudes on water consumption, we considered the
    findings from several recent studies that have demonstrated the impact of pro-environmental
    attitudes on conservation behaviors (Boylu & Gunay, 2017; Gilg & Barr, 2006; Jorgensen
    et al., 2014; Obringer et al., 2022; Willis et al., 2011). As such, within our
    modeling framework, we added a constant increase or decrease in water consumption
    beyond the baseline water use (e.g., calculated following Wang et al., 2021) for
    each archetype. Following the calculations, the display plots the change to the
    modeled storage variable with the historical values. The values are also saved
    in an output file. Finally, after the model reaches the final time step, the measures
    of error are calculated and printed to the screen. 3.4 Design concepts One of
    the basic principles of this model is that attitudes influence behavior. Here,
    we consider an attitude to be an assessment of an entity, object, or concept that
    influences one''s perceptions and behavior (Ajzen, 1991). In our model, we consider
    attitudes toward water conservation, which have been shown to play a major role
    in individual perceptions and actions related to water and climate change (Boylu
    & Gunay, 2017; Jorgensen et al., 2014; Larson et al., 2011; White et al., 2019).
    Additionally, the basis of the storage calculation is a water balance equation,
    which has been shown to be an effective way to model hydrological systems (Klingel
    & Knobloch, 2015; Xu & Singh, 1998). Essentially, if we can capture all of the
    inputs and outputs to the system, we can calculate the change in storage fairly
    accurately. The determination of water consumption was performed outside the ABM,
    as discussed in Section 4. However, the storage calculation is performed at each
    time step and is controlled by the water balance submodel (see Section 4). The
    model is ultimately designed to provide insight into the role of attitudes in
    large water systems. Although this connection has been demonstrated through empirical
    studies (Boylu & Gunay, 2017; Jorgensen et al., 2014; Larson et al., 2011; White
    et al., 2019), there has not been a study that explored this phenomenon through
    an ABM. The ABM has the ability to test scenarios and policies aimed at changing
    attitudes toward water conservation; thus, it can be used to predict the efficacy
    of potential demand management strategies. A fundamental characteristic of ABMs
    is emergence. That is, the concept that system changes can emerge through individual
    agent behaviors. In our model, the system behavior is the change in storage, which
    is controlled through a combination of climatic factors and water consumption.
    Ultimately, system behavior will emerge from the changing water consumption, driven
    by the water conservation attitudes held by the agents. This behavior is dependent
    on the archetype to which the agent belongs. There are, however, non-emergent
    properties, such as the climate forcing of the water supply, which follows historical
    observations. These values also impact water supply but are independent of agent
    behavior. While these variables are, at the moment, governed by the historical
    values in the study region, there is an opportunity to extend the model to include
    either stochastic parameterizations of climate factors or a coupled model that
    explicitly models the climate in the area. Ultimately, we decided to maintain
    the more simplistic version that considers historical values so that we could
    focus on the impact of changing attitudes. Similarly, the agents in our model
    do not adapt to changing conditions. This is a feature that could be built into
    the model for future iterations, but would increase complexity and go beyond the
    current scope of this study. Another key design concept of ABMs is the amount
    of information agents can sense and interact with. In our model, each agent knows
    their own archetype but not that of any other agent. That is, there is no “sensing”
    of other agents'' archetypes. Similarly, the agents do not sense the climatic
    conditions beyond the season (e.g., their water consumption will change if it
    is summer vs. winter, but not if it is a rainy vs. sunny day). Future iterations
    may use this aspect as a point of extension, since in reality, people make water
    consumption decisions based on environmental conditions (e.g., choosing not to
    water lawns when there is rain in the forecast). This decision was made to keep
    the model as parsimonious as possible, as the goal is to focus on the impact of
    shifting attitudes, not model fully realistic households. In addition to the lack
    of sensing, there are no interactions between agents. This further reduces the
    complexity and allows us to investigate the impact of archetypes overall without
    evaluating in- or out-group interactions. This, however, does reduce the realism
    of our model, since people tend to have networks of friends and family that may
    influence attitudes toward water conservation. Stochasticity is another design
    concept that can help to add realism to the ABM. The main addition of stochasticity
    in our model is through the use of statistical distributions. First, the agents
    are randomly assigned to an archetype based on the empirical proportion of each
    archetype in the city. Then, water use is pulled from an archetype-specific distribution
    that was determined through the empirical data. This means that each simulation
    has different agents in each archetype, as well as different water use rates.
    This helps capture the real-life variability in water consumption rather than
    assuming a set value for each agent. Further, in many ABMs, collectives are used
    to distinguish groups among agents and provide characteristics shared by all members
    of the group. In our model, the archetypes are considered to be a collective.
    That is, each agent is a member of one archetype, which determines their individual
    water consumption. The archetypes are explicit entities that do not emerge from
    agent behavior. Rather, they are a top-down classifier that controls water consumption.
    There is limited interaction between archetypes, although we will explore scenarios
    in which agents switch archetypes between simulations. Finally, the observations
    obtained through the modeling process are a critical piece of the overall design
    concepts. The key output of this model is the reservoir storage over time. At
    each time step, the model calculates the change in storage. At the end of the
    simulation, the model compares the modeled time series with the actual data. We
    calculate the measure of error (normalized root mean squared error; NRMSE, shown
    in Equation 3) to evaluate model accuracy and R2 (shown in Equation 2) to evaluate
    the goodness of fit. Over 100 simulations, we determine the average error as well
    as the range over which the error tends to fall. This provides us with a summary
    of the model performance. 3.5 Initialization To set up the model, we first initialized
    the hydrological and climatological data. This step included uploading observational
    data for the model to pull from when necessary. Then, we initialized 400,000 agents,
    which represent households in the city, and specified the archetype each agent
    belongs to based on the proportion in the observed dataset. Given the specificity
    of this initialization, it is important to note that our model has been tailored
    to model water supply in the city of Phoenix, Arizona. In theory, if there was
    data from additional cities, it would be possible to transfer the model to other
    research areas. One would need to collect the hydroclimatic data as well as the
    archetype data, the latter being more labor intensive. The initial conditions
    remain the same throughout all the simulations, since the goal of the model is
    to assess the impact of agent behavior. We did, however, run multiple experiments
    in which the proportion of archetypes is initialized differently. This allowed
    us to explore the impact of shifting archetypes in the city through hypothetical
    policies. That being said, each experiment had 100 simulations, all of which had
    the same climatic initialization. 3.6 Input data The input data in our model includes
    several hydroclimatic variables—precipitation, evaporation, streamflow, and storage.
    Each of these variables was obtained through publicly available databases. In
    particular, the precipitation data were collected from the National Centers for
    Environmental Information (NCEI), which hosts a database of weather stations (NOAA
    National Centers for Environmental Information, 2019). We extracted daily precipitation
    data from eight stations around the city of Phoenix, which we then aggregated
    spatially. The evaporation data were obtained from the Arizona State Climate Office,
    which records daily pan evaporation rates near Phoenix. We obtained streamflow
    data from U.S. Geological Survey (2020), while storage was collected directly
    from the management agencies (SRP and CAP) through FOIA requests. To model the
    total storage throughout the system, we conceptualized the system as one large
    reservoir equal to the size of the many smaller reservoirs that make up the system.
    In this sense, we did not have to account for transfers between reservoirs, simplifying
    our model. More information on these environmental variables can be found in Table
    1. 3.7 Submodels The main submodel in our model is the water balance submodel,
    which calculates the reservoir storage. This model takes the historical observations
    for precipitation, evaporation, and streamflow, as well as the agents'' water
    consumption. The storage is calculated as shown in Equation (1). (1) Here, St
    is the storage being calculated at t time step and St−1 is the storage calculated
    at the previous time step. P is the precipitation, Qin is the streamflow into
    the reservoir, Qout is the streamflow out of the reservoir, E is the evaporation,
    and W is the water consumption. Additionally, at the end of the model run, we
    calculate errors through the model performance submodel. In particular, we calculate
    R2 and NRMSE, which are shown in Equations (2) and (3), respectively. (2) (3)
    In both Equations (2) and (3), y represents the observed values, represents the
    predicted (i.e., modeled) values, represents the average of the observed values,
    and n is the sample size. 4 RESULTS The aim of this study was to develop an ABM
    to further understanding the impact of water conservation attitudes on overall
    water supply. As such, we used historical observations of climate and only varied
    the water consumption over the 100 model runs. These variations were driven by
    random draws from predetermined distributions (see Section 4 for more details).
    The results from this analysis are shown in Figure 1, which depicts the results
    from the 100 different model runs in gray and the average of those runs in black.
    As shown, there was very little variation between the model runs. This is primarily
    caused by the fact that the only variation comes from the water consumption, since
    we used the same climatic conditions in all runs. This decision allowed us to
    evaluate the impact of water consumption, which is driven by water conservation
    attitudes, on the water supply without needing to account for the changes in climate
    between model runs. Also in Figure 1, we show the observed water supply values,
    indicated by the blue line. These results indicate a fairly accurate match between
    the observed water supply and the modeled water supply. There is a notable separation
    between the modeled results and the observations as the time period progresses,
    particularly when the water supply drops below 1.5 billion m3. Here, the actual
    water supply is higher than the modeled supply, possibly due to the assumption
    that all households are drawing from the same water consumption distribution for
    the entire time period. This may not be realistic in times of drought, for example,
    when there may be policies encouraging or mandating water use reductions beyond
    the “normal” distribution. Our model, at this time, does not account for those
    changes, which might explain the lower water supply in those periods. That being
    said, the model performs fairly well overall and appears to be able to match the
    pattern of water supply in the city. FIGURE 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Modeled storage over time for each of the 100 modeled runs (light gray lines)
    and the average of all 100 model runs (black line). The actual storage is also
    plotted (blue line). 4.1 Model performance Going beyond the visual analysis of
    the model, we can calculate various measures of model performance. To evaluate
    the model performance, we calculated the NRMSE and R2 for each of the 100 model
    runs. The R2 values can be used to evaluate the goodness of fit between the observed
    and modeled values, while the NRMSE is a measure of error that can be interpreted
    as a percentage. The results from this analysis are reported in Table 2. TABLE
    2. Model performance for the baseline scenario over 100 model runs. Measure Minimum
    Mean Maximum NRMSE 8.2 9.4 10.1 R 2 0.98 0.98 0.98 Abbreviation: NRMSE, normalized
    root mean squared error. The results presented in Table 2 confirm the visual results
    shown in Figure 1—the model is accurate, with high R2 values and low NRMSE values.
    In particular, all 100 model runs had a final R2 value of 0.98 (note that there
    was some variation, but all rounded to 0.98), indicating a high goodness of fit.
    Moreover, this value can be viewed as the amount of variation explained by the
    model. In this sense, the ABM explains 98% of the variation in the observed water
    supply values. Similarly, the NRMSE values are low, indicating a relatively low
    amount of error in the model. In fact, across all 100 model runs, the error ranged
    from 8.2% to 10.1%. This suggests that the model is a good representation of the
    real water system that supplies the city of Phoenix. Going forward, we will use
    this baseline scenario to explore the impact of changing the proportion of archetypes
    in the city, which will ultimately impact the overall water consumption. 4.2 Scenario
    testing Water managers often implement policies aimed at reducing water consumption,
    particularly during periods of drought. These policies are generally broad in
    nature; however, it is possible that more targeted interventions might be more
    successful in reducing water consumption. To test the influence of these hypothetical
    targeted policies, we developed five generic scenarios. These scenarios are not
    tied to specific policy; rather, they represent a generic action aimed at changing
    the proportion of the various archetypes within the city (see Obringer & White,
    2023 for details on the archetypes, as well as the Supporting Information for
    a brief summary). The five scenarios are: 1. “Partial Participation”: some policy
    is adopted after which 50% of the households in archetype 3 (“the would-be participants”)
    become archetype 5 (“the participants”). 2. “Full Participation”: some policy
    is adopted after which 100% of the households in archetype 3 (“the would-be participants”)
    become archetype 5 (“the participants”). 3. “Individualistic”: some policy is
    adopted after which 100% of the households in archetype 6 (“the confident deniers”)
    become archetype 2 (“the individualists”). 4. “Concerned”: some policy is adopted
    after which 100% of the households in archetype 7 (“the disengaged”) become archetype
    4 (“the concerned”). 5. “All Changes”: the policies from scenarios 2–4 are adopted
    simultaneously. Each of these scenarios was run 100 times using the same climate
    data as the baseline scenario. The results from this analysis are shown in Figure
    2, which contains both the time series of the average model run in each scenario
    and the box plots showing the distribution of water supply in each scenario. We
    can see that changing the proportion of archetypes does have an impact on the
    overall water supply when compared the baseline, although some scenarios have
    a greater impact than others. FIGURE 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint (a) Modeled
    storage over time for each scenario averaged over the 100 model runs. Note that
    the scenarios are numbered as previously shown in the text. (b) Distribution of
    storage values for each scenario. The plots show the median, interquartile range,
    and maximum/minimum values in each of the scenarios through time. For example,
    the “Full Participation” scenario leads to the greatest change of the solitary
    policies (i.e., excluding the “All Changes” scenario). In this scenario, the households
    that were classified as “would-be participants” are converted to “participants,”
    which have positive attitudes toward water conservation and are actively participating
    in programs (see Obringer & White, 2023 or Supporting Information for details
    on the archetypes). As such, we see a statistically significant increase in the
    water supply (p < 2.2 × 10−16). In fact, the median storage increased by 9.5%
    above the baseline in this scenario. The “Partial Participation” is similar to
    the “Full Participation” scenario, but with less households changing archetypes.
    Nonetheless, this scenario still sees a statistically significant increase in
    the storage (p = 2.889 × 10−5), with the median increasing by 4.5% above the baseline
    scenario. This indicates that even getting a fraction of the households to shift
    archetypes can benefit the water system through increased supply. Scenarios 3
    and 4 (“Individualistic” and “Concerned,” respectively) were less effective at
    increasing storage. The “Individualistic” scenario involves transforming the “confident
    deniers,” who deny the existence of any water-related problems but feel confident
    in their ability to respond to any future water-related problems, into “individualists,”
    who view water conservation as a personal endeavor rather than a top-down government
    regulatory issue (see Obringer & White, 2023 or Supporting Information for details
    on the archetypes). While this may be a difficult policy to implement, if successful,
    it would lead to a median increase in 2.1% of storage, which is only slightly
    significant (p = 0.04275). The “Concerned” scenario is similar in that it considers
    the impact of converting the “disengaged” households into “concerned” households
    (see Obringer & White, 2023 or Supporting Information for details on the archetypes).
    The “disengaged” households are not aware of any water-related problems nor any
    conservation programs in the city, so educating these households on the current
    status of the water supply system could be beneficial. However, the “disengaged”
    archetype is the smallest group in Phoenix, so their transformation only leads
    to an increase in the median water storage of 0.4%, which is statistically insignificant
    (p = 0.6549). While it would still be beneficial to try to reach out to these
    households, water managers may wish to spend resources elsewhere to see the largest
    improvement. 5 DISCUSSION The goal of this study was to build an ABM to model
    the impact of water conservation attitudes on overall water availability. In periods
    of drought, cities often encourage, possibly even mandate, reduced water consumption
    to help conserve the water supply. However, without changing the underlying values,
    beliefs, and attitudes associated with water conservation, it is unlikely that
    these initiatives will be successful, particularly in the long term (Bernedo et
    al., 2014; Cominola et al., 2021). Here, we leveraged an ABM to specifically model
    the impact of these attitudes while holding all other variables constant (e.g.,
    population, climate, demographics). Our results indicated that the best course
    of action was to focus intervention efforts on a subset of residents that recognize
    the problem but are unsure how to help. These residents, the “would-be participants,”
    are not only willing to participate in water conservation programs but are also
    among the most prevalent archetypes in Phoenix (Obringer & White, 2023). Thus,
    targeted campaigns have a high chance of success and are more likely to make a
    significant difference in the water availability, as discussed in Section 4. An
    example of this targeted intervention would be a high-quality educational campaign
    aimed at providing information and resources related to existing water conservation
    programs. As reported in Obringer and White (2023), this archetype has a larger
    percentage of non-white identifying people, more lower- and middle-income households,
    and more long-term residents compared to the other archetypes. This suggests that
    the members of this archetype have lived in the area long enough to recognize
    the problem but have not felt like they are able to participate, either through
    a lack of knowledge, funds, access to other supporting resources (e.g., time),
    access to decision-making processes, and/or structural discrimination on the basis
    of race or class. As such, policies aimed at targeting the Would-Be Participants
    should focus on low-cost programs to help conserve water. By focusing on affordable
    solutions, it might be possible to engage with these residents that would like
    to participate but might not have been able to afford to do so. Additionally,
    given that nearly 50% of the non-white residents in this archetype identify as
    Latinx (Obringer & White, 2023), it would likely help to run these targeted campaigns
    in both English and Spanish. That being said, this should not preclude simultaneous
    targeting of high-intensity users, which often consume more water than disadvantaged
    groups. It is crucial that any interventions aimed at low- and middle-income,
    non-white households do not result in the expectation that disadvantaged households
    need to “do more”. Instead, such interventions should emphasize bringing these
    households into the conversation and focusing on their needs regarding water conservation.
    By leveraging this combination of agent-based modeling and water conservation
    attitude archetypes, we are able to extract insights that can then be used to
    either inform policies or future studies. Going forward, this work can be done
    as a precursor to interview work, which often results in a rich qualitative dataset
    that can further integrate with the data-driven methodology presented here, similar
    to what was demonstrated by Obringer et al. (2022). Future work can use this study
    as a steppingstone for deeper studies, perhaps focusing on conducting interviews
    with the Would-Be Participants, so that we can determine their reasoning behind
    not participating rather than relying solely on demographics, as we have done
    here. This would allow for interventions that are even more tailored to the residents,
    likely leading to more successful implementation. In terms of the water saved
    through these hypothetical policies, the results of this study indicate that there
    could be up to a 9.5% increase in total water supply above the baseline, depending
    on the level of conversion from Would-Be Participants to Participants. While 9.5%
    may not seem like much for individual households, but when considering the water
    supply for the entire city, this becomes a sizable savings. For example, over
    our observed time period, Phoenix had an average of 1.73 billion m3 of water available
    per day (storage). Our results indicate that by converting residents from Would-Be
    Participants to Participants, there could be an increase of 9.5%, approximately
    164 million m3. This is enough to fill over 65,000 Olympic-sized swimming pools.
    Over the course of the year, this could save a significant amount of water that
    could be used to make up for lower flows in the Colorado River (Udall & Overpeck,
    2017; Williams et al., 2022) or contribute to groundwater recharge efforts. There
    are several limitations of this study. The primary being the lack of specificity
    within the survey data. Due to the anonymous nature of the survey, we were unable
    to account for geographic variables (e.g., locations within the city) or actual
    meter readings for water consumption. Instead, we have focused on discussing the
    household-specific impacts on water conservation as well as the demographics that
    can be related to the archetypes. In terms of the water consumption, we leveraged
    several equations published within the literature to calculate base water consumption
    as well as the archetype-specific consumption trends. Finally, this work used
    survey data from a fraction of the total households in Phoenix; thus, our model
    generalizes those results to the entire population through a distribution function.
    Future work may want to extend the survey to account for more people within the
    area, and therefore capturing a greater variety of attitudes across the city.
    Overall, this study can serve as a first step toward integrating water conservation
    attitudes with models of water availability. Changing these attitudes, alongside
    one''s values and beliefs, is one way that management agencies can work to enact
    long-term water consumption reductions. 6 CONCLUSION The goal of this study was
    to develop an ABM that leveraged water conservation attitudes to control the overall
    water consumption in the city of Phoenix. Through this work, we first demonstrated
    that the model was fairly accurate over 100 model runs, with an average normalized
    root mean squared error of 9.4. Using the modeled water supply, we tested several
    scenarios in which we changed the resident attitudes while leaving every other
    variable the same. This allowed us to compare the results of unspecified, hypothetical
    policies on the overall water supply. The results indicated that converting the
    Would-Be Participants into Participants has the largest effect on the overall
    water availability. These archetypes represent two similar attitudes toward water
    conservation. The participants recognize there is a problem and are actively participating
    in water conservation programs. The Would-Be Participants also recognize that
    there is a problem; however, while they indicate a desire to participate in programs,
    they also state that they do not know how to get involved. Thus, well-developed
    educational campaigns might be a beneficial intervention to reach these residents.
    Going forward, this work can be used as a steppingstone for similar analyses in
    different cities or more detailed analyses within the city of Phoenix. With additional
    data, it will be possible to test specific policies and get an idea of the results
    prior to spending time and money on implementation. Research such as this can
    be used to not only better understand the role of attitudes on water consumption,
    but also lead to a practical model for local management agencies trying to reduce
    water demand in the long term. AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS Renee Obringer: Conceptualization;

    regulations cost-benefit analysis Introduction ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To To meet
    ever increasing water demands, utilities are constantly seeking the most cost-effective
    options to expand their water supplies. (1) While in the recent past this may
    have involved conveying surface water over greater distances or drilling deeper
    wells into freshwater aquifers, the onset of climate change has added considerable
    uncertainty to these cost-benefit calculations. (2,3) As a result, alternatives─especially
    municipal wastewater reuse─have been gaining traction because of their resiliency
    to drought. (4) Notably, the planned treatment of municipal wastewater for potable
    (and nonpotable) applications is also being adopted in water-abundant regions
    to satisfy stricter wastewater disposal regulations, overcome geographic limitations
    in water storage capacity, protect natural resources, and achieve greater water
    resource independence. (5,6) Due to its critical role in legitimizing water reuse,
    the original treatment train designed by the Orange County Water District (OCWD)
    in California for Water Factory 21 has informed what has become the gold standard
    for water reuse. (7) Further validated by Singapore’s NEWater program and OCWD’s
    upgraded Groundwater Replenishment System, this three-step, multibarrier process
    involves pretreatment by microfiltration (MF)─more recently, ultrafiltration (UF)─to
    remove suspended solids, colloidal matter, and pathogens; reverse osmosis (RO)
    to remove dissolved solids, metals and chemical pollutants; and advanced oxidation
    processes (AOP) to remove trace micropollutants. (8) Specifically, the RO step
    in wastewater reuse operates at moderate pressures (10–20 bar) to filter wastewater
    effluent through a polymeric membrane that rejects salt and most dissolved constituents
    and recovers 80–85% of the inlet flow as permeate. (9) Municipal wastewater reuse
    concentrate (MWRC) accounts for the remaining 15–20% of flow and contains all
    the constituents fed to and rejected by the RO, which have now been concentrated
    5–6-fold. In addition to having higher total dissolved solids (TDS) of approximately
    3,000 to 8,000 mg/L, and process chemicals (e.g., antiscalants and biocides),
    MWRC contains elevated concentrations of metals, nutrients, and micropollutants,
    which include pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), endocrine disrupting
    compounds (EDCs), per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), microplastics, and
    other contaminants of emerging concern (CECs). (10) The rising prevalence of MWRC
    as a byproduct of water reuse distinguishes it from other reverse osmosis concentrates
    (ROCs), requiring special consideration for MWRC management (Figure 1). Figure
    1 Figure 1. Cycle of municipal wastewater reuse and the corresponding production
    of municipal wastewater reuse concentrate (MWRC). Today, advanced wastewater treatment
    for reuse typically involves ultrafiltration (UF), reverse osmosis (RO), and advanced
    oxidation processes (AOPs). The generation of MWRC is inherent in the operation
    of RO, which recovers 80–85% of its inflow but concentrates most dissolved contaminants
    into the MWRC waste stream that comprises the remaining 15–20% of flow. MWRC differs
    from other reverse osmosis concentrates because it contains elevated concentrations
    of contaminants specific to municipal wastewater, including total dissolved solids
    (TDS), metals, nutrients, and micropollutants. As water reuse practices become
    more widespread, the generation of MWRC will also increase. Therefore, challenges
    and opportunities for the future management of MWRC need to be explored. As we
    transition our linear water systems into a One Water Cycle─or an integrated planning
    and implementation approach to managing finite water resources for long-term resilience
    and reliability, meeting both community and natural ecosystem needs─the ability
    to implement water reuse is becoming contingent on the ability to manage the MWRC
    that is generated in the process. (11−13) The goal of this critical review is
    to create a common foundation for researchers, practitioners, and regulators by
    providing an interdisciplinary set of tools and frameworks to address the challenges
    and opportunities of MWRC management. To encourage systems thinking across different
    water sectors for MWRC management, this review draws on existing wastewater and
    general brine management practices to inform holistic planning for MWRC management,
    applies advancements in monitoring and regulatory techniques to ensure the safe
    and cost-effective implementation of MWRC management, and explores the promises
    and pitfalls of MWRC valorization while examining the critical role of cost-benefit
    analysis. Holistic Planning of MWRC Infrastructure ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To MWRC
    management strategies for wastewater municipalities implementing reuse (“reuse
    municipalities”) are currently developed case-by-case, depending on geographical
    considerations, discharge/disposal regulations, proximity to sensitive environments,
    capacity of existing infrastructure, and other local determinants (Figure 2).
    Drawing from established brine management practices, current MWRC management options
    include discharge into surface waters (e.g., seas, estuaries, freshwater systems),
    sewer disposal, direct use via land application, well injection, evaporation ponds,
    zero liquid discharge (ZLD), or, in combination with another disposal option,
    minimal liquid discharge (MLD). (14) Overall, brine management can constitute
    a significant portion of total costs (up to 33%). (15) Meanwhile, stricter environmental
    discharge regulations are reducing the options for MWRC disposal. (16,17) Figure
    2 Figure 2. The interconnected categories of MWRC management include conveyance
    (e.g., brine lines, sewer disposal), artificial end points (e.g., evaporation
    ponds, MLD, and ZLD), and environmental end points (e.g., surface water outfall,
    well injection, and land application). Artificial end points are distinct from
    environmental end points in that they are still engineered systems that do not
    discharge to the environment until solid waste is produced and typically disposed
    of by landfill. Nature-based treatment systems, direct use via land application,
    and MLD/ZLD are highlighted because they offer multibenefits in addition to MWRC
    disposal. Interconnectedness of MWRC Management Options Existing MWRC management
    options can be organized into three categories: conveyance, artificial end points,
    and environmental end points. Conveyance is the transport of MWRC beyond the jurisdiction
    of the reuse municipality via brine lines (to artificial or environmental end
    points) and by sewer disposal. Artificial end points─including evaporation ponds,
    MLD or ZLD─are “artificial” because highly concentrated or solid waste from the
    MWRC is produced, requiring disposal to an environmental end point. Environmental
    end points are the eventual outlet of MWRC from our engineered water system, including
    surface water outflow, land application, well injection, and landfilling (for
    solid waste). Ocean outfall (or discharge to any saline water body) is a critical
    environmental end point for MWRC, due to the already elevated TDS and vast volumes
    for dilution of the receiving water body. (18) However, this option is less accessible
    for inland municipalities that may be considering reuse. As a result, conveyance
    infrastructure (to both artificial and environmental end points) will play an
    important role in increasing MWRC management options for inland reuse municipalities.
    For example, the City of Beaumont in southern California, USA was able to implement
    reuse due to its proximity to the Inland Empire Brine Line, despite being located
    more than 70 miles from the coast. (19) Constructing a 23-mile pipeline (or “lateral”)
    to connect to this conveyance infrastructure, the City of Beaumont is able to
    convey their MWRC an additional 73 miles to Orange County Sanitation District’s
    municipal wastewater treatment facility where it is blended and treated with local
    wastewater before being discharged to the Pacific Ocean. (20) Although urban development
    throughout southern California would likely make the construction of this infrastructure
    cost-prohibitive today, brine lines are still viable in regions where land costs
    are lower or─alternatively─can be used to convey MWRC to artificial and environmental
    end points other than the ocean. Another important form of conveyance is sewer
    disposal or discharging the wastewater generated by one municipality into the
    sewer network of another (typically larger) municipality. In fact, the previous
    example could be thought of as a form a sewer disposal as the MWRC eventually
    made its way to Ocean County Sanitation District before ocean outfall. The benefits
    of sewer disposal include: (i) unlike new artificial end points, larger sewer
    networks have already been constructed; (ii) sewer networks can be more readily
    accessible than environmental end points; (iii) existing wastewater in the sewer
    network dilutes MWRC, making it easier to discharge; and (iv) eventual disposal
    falls under existing discharge permits of the larger wastewater municipality.
    (21) To ensure sewer disposal of MWRC does not impact the larger wastewater municipality’s
    operation or ability to discharge, reuse municipalities would likely be subjected
    to industrial pretreatment programs. (22) As MWRC is a concentrated form of secondary
    wastewater effluent, sewer disposal is unlikely to introduce new constituents
    that would significantly impact the larger municipality’s ability to discharge,
    although this may depend on what industries are upstream of the reuse municipality.
    (23) A challenging constituent in MWRC for sewer disposal is TDS, which may impact
    biological wastewater treatment processes. However, these biological processes
    have been shown to acclimate to TDS as high as 10 g/L after several weeks. (24)
    As a result, there is still significant capacity for larger wastewater municipalities
    to assimilate MWRC as reuse becomes more prevalent in the future. Distributed
    MWRC Infrastructure Conveyance is an effective strategy, assuming that MWRC (and
    its associated TDS content) is eventually purged from the engineered water system.
    As environmental regulations decrease the availability of environmental end points,
    there is a need for distributed MWRC infrastructure to provide small-scale, cost-effective
    options for MWRC management near the point of MWRC generation. (25) One form of
    distributed MWRC infrastructure is to designate an area to serve as an engineered
    or natural reservoir that facilitates natural evaporation of the MWRC. Evaporation
    ponds are shallow pits that promote evaporation by spreading brine over broad
    swaths of land, and─in some cases─promote natural attenuation of micropollutants.
    (26) To protect underlying aquifers, evaporation ponds are often required to be
    constructed with impervious linings, which increases the total cost of this approach
    to between $3.3/m3 and $10.0/m3 when coupled with rising land costs. (27,28) While
    mechanical misting can be used to enhance evaporation by spraying brine into the
    air to form tiny droplets, this comes at the added cost of $0.8/m3. (29) However,
    evaporation ponds are restricted to regions where evaporation rates are high (>1
    m/year), precipitation rates are low (<0.3 m/year), and flat land is both abundant
    and cheap. (21,30) Moreover, evaporation ponds run the risk of introducing micropollutants
    to the environment if there is a breach in the impervious layer or by direct exposure
    to wildlife. (18,31) In addition to these considerations, natural evaporation
    rates are often too low to meet the throughput required for MWRC management. Recent
    research has explored the possibility of using porous, light-absorbing materials
    to accelerate the evaporation process for ZLD applications. (32−34) Known as interfacial
    solar vapor generation, this process uses capillary action to spread water into
    thin films across three-dimensional surfaces to achieve evaporation rates 100
    times higher than traditional evaporation ponds. (35) Furthermore, these materials
    could cover standing bodies of water to mitigate wildlife exposure and can be
    designed to facilitate the degradation of micropollutants. (36) Although promising,
    the durability of these materials and their long-term performance on actual brine
    streams still require further investigation. ZLD offers another form of a distributed
    MWRC infrastructure. ZLD refers to the process where the water is completely recovered
    from a concentrated waste stream, leaving only solid waste for disposal. Conventional
    ZLD is achieved in two steps: brine concentration through mechanical vapor compression
    (MVC) to increase TDS to ∼250,000 mg/L, followed by brine crystallization through
    vapor compression crystallization to remove any remaining water. (37) The trade-off
    with land-intensive evaporation ponds is that thermal-based ZLD processes are
    energy-intensive, with brine concentration requiring 20–25 kWhe/m3 and brine crystallization
    requiring 52–66 kWhe/m3 of treated water. (38,39) These high energy demands lead
    to high operating costs, which at an average electricity cost ($0.15/kWh) corresponds
    to brine concentration costing $3.0/m3 to $3.8/m3 and brine crystallization costing
    $7.8/m3 to $9.9/m3. (40) To reduce the high operating costs of thermal brine concentration,
    a wide range of membrane-based technologies have emerged to achieve minimal liquid
    discharge (MLD), or up to 95% recovery of water from the concentrated stream.
    (41−43) Not having to induce a phase-change for brine concentration, membrane-based
    MLD technologies are inherently less energy-intensive, achieving the same level
    of brine concentration as MVC, but with 75% less energy. (44) Membrane-based MLD
    technologies that are currently under development include high-pressure reverse
    osmosis (HPRO), osmotically assisted reverse osmosis (OARO), and low-salt-rejection
    reverse osmosis (LSRRO). (43,45,46) In conjunction with artificial end points,
    the goal of MLD is to minimize the amount of MWRC that needs to be managed by
    evaporation ponds or ZLD. One final option that is similar to ZLD (in that it
    does not produce a liquid waste) is the implementation of carbon-based advanced
    treatment for reuse. As an alternative to the membrane-based advanced treatment
    train that uses UF-RO-AOP, carbon-based advanced treatment consists of ozone (O3),
    biological activated carbon (BAC), granular activated carbon (GAC), and ultraviolet
    radiation (UV), which follows the nonmembrane treatment scheme of the world’s
    first direct potable reuse plant in Windhoek, Namibia. (47,48) The primary benefit
    of carbon-based advanced treatment is that─without RO─MWRC is not produced and
    does not need to be managed. Comparing these two treatment trains by the Sustainable
    Water Initiative for Tomorrow (SWIFT) program, carbon-based advanced treatment
    was ultimately selected because of its lower levelized cost of water and improved
    geochemical compatibility of reclaimed water for groundwater augmentation (with
    higher TDS effluent reducing metal mobilization). (49−51) Although this is a promising
    advancement for reuse, more research is needed to compare the advantages and disadvantages
    between carbon- and membrane-based advanced treatment. For example, the implementation
    of carbon-based treatment may be less feasible in regions where the TDS of wastewater
    effluent is higher or supplemental water supplies to dilute the final reclaimed
    water are limited, which tends to be more common in water scarce regions. (52)
    Furthermore, the formation of ozonation transformation products or region-specific
    regulations on contaminant removal (e.g., total organic carbon) can significantly
    influence whether carbon- or membrane-based advanced treatment is selected. (53,54)
    As a result, the development of distributed MWRC infrastructure still has a critical
    role to play in facilitating reuse. Multi-Benefit MWRC Disposal It should be noted
    that both evaporation ponds and ZLD produce solid waste from MWRC that is typically
    disposed of by landfill as an environmental end point. This solid waste may contain
    micropollutants and requires testing to determine whether the landfill used for
    disposal should be rated for municipal solid waste or hazardous waste. (29) While
    the impacts of emerging micropollutants on environmental systems are still being
    studied, it can be safely assumed that their release to the environment is likely
    to lead to adverse outcomes that can range from negligible to disastrous. As these
    micropollutants are at their most concentrated since their initial discharge into
    the sewer system, the capabilities of ZLD could be expanded to not only enable
    MWRC management but also facilitate the destruction of these contaminants before
    their potential introduction to the environment. However, more research is needed
    to evaluate both the efficacy and cost of micropollutant destruction methods.
    (55,56) Alternatively, other benefits can be derived from the direct use of MWRC.
    Land application is the use of MWRC to irrigate salt-tolerant plants (called halophytes).
    (21) As land does not need to be purchased, this MWRC management strategy can
    be less costly (between $0.74/m3 and $1.95/m3), if a suitable operation is locally
    available. (27) In addition to land application, the Agua Doce Program in Brazil
    experimented with using ROC from inland desalination plants to grow tilapia and
    Spirulina as fodder supplements for livestock. (57) Although this program has
    provided economic benefits to rural regions in northeastern Brazil, the use of
    ROC for irrigation has been observed to cause progressive soil salinization. (57,58)
    Furthermore, the suitability of MWRC (as opposed to ROC from groundwater desalination)
    for these applications is still uncertain due to the presence of micropollutants.
    Similar to evaporation ponds, aqua- or algaculture can directly expose wildlife
    to these contaminants, whereas percolation from land application can potentially
    contaminate drinking water aquifers. (59) As a result, additional precautions
    or treatments may be necessary before direct use of MWRC. A final multibenefit
    option for MWRC disposal is the use of nature-based treatment systems. (60) In
    the form of engineered wetlands, ponds, or subsurface flow, nature-based treatment
    systems can reduce MWRC volumes through evapotranspiration and promote the further
    degradation micropollutants. (61) Like other forms of green infrastructure, nature-based
    treatment systems can also foster habitats to support biodiversity, prevent soil
    erosion, provide flood control, reduce the heat island effect, mitigate noise
    pollution, all while providing aesthetic green spaces for the public to enjoy.
    (60,62) Serving as the potential backdrop for multiuse public spaces, green infrastructure
    for MWRC management also brings together a wide range of stakeholders, from community
    members and conservationists to utility providers and city planners. (63) And
    it is by integrating these diverse perspectives into decision-making processes
    that gives rise to holistic solutions for MWRC management. Enabling Reuse through
    MWRC Regulations ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To MWRC management typically falls under
    existing disposal programs that cover municipal wastewater treatment plants. (64)
    As a result, water reuse facilities must obtain permits that specify treatment
    and monitoring requirements before being able to discharge MWRC to the environment.
    (65) Depending on the environmental end point (e.g., ocean, surface waters, land
    application, aquifer), these treatment and monitoring requirements may vary. (64)
    As previously discussed, the composition of MWRC is comparable to secondary effluent
    that has (i) undergone UF to remove suspended solids, colloidal matter, and pathogens;
    (ii) been infused with small concentrations (0.5–2 mg/L) of process chemicals
    additives, such as residual coagulants or antiscalants; and (iii) been concentrated
    5–6-fold by RO (Table 1). The MWRC concentrations presented in Table 1 have been
    estimated based on values reported for secondary wastewater effluent. However,
    this composition may vary significantly depending on industrial dischargers and
    regional regulations. Table 1. Typical Properties and Composition of Municipal

    sodium metabisulfite Micropollutants Pharmaceutical and personal care products
    (PPCPs), endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs), disinfection byproducts (DBPs),
    per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), microplastics The Expanding Role of
    Monitoring Due to the variable composition and concentrated nature of MWRC, it
    can be extremely challenging to characterize. However, the expanded monitoring
    of secondary effluent can be used to develop a basic understanding of the compositional
    makeup of MWRC, where regulations often require monitoring of bulk parameters
    such as chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), total organic
    carbon (TOC), total suspended solids (TSS), nutrients (e.g., nitrogen, phosphorus),
    and other priority contaminants. (71) As these constituents will be concentrated
    by RO, a conservative approximation would be to assume complete rejection and
    multiply the secondary effluent concentrations by the concentrating factor of
    the RO, where the concentrating factor is the inverse of 100% minus the RO recovery.
    However, deviations from this approximation are likely to occur because the UF
    will reduce TSS, BOD, COD, and potentially other dissolved species if a coagulant
    has been used, and RO may have variable species rejection─especially of small,
    neutrally charged constituents. (72−74) As larger, biological constituents of
    concern (e.g., protozoans, bacteria, viruses, and ARGs) are likely to be rejected
    by UF and recycled upstream of the municipal wastewater treatment plant, the primary
    MWRC constituents of concern for discharging to the environment are micropollutants
    (e.g., PPCPs, EDCs, DBPs, PFAS, microplastics), metals (e.g., cadmium, chromium,
    copper, lead, mercury, nickel, zinc, arsenic, selenium), and nutrients. (75) Focusing
    on the presence of these constituents in secondary effluents, micropollutants
    may constitute thousands of different organic compounds that are present at extremely
    low concentrations. Although organic constituents are traditionally characterized
    by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and gas chromatography (GC),
    these techniques need to be coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic
    resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and may require extensive isolation and enrichment
    protocols to accurately obtain molecular and structural information. (76) In the
    presence of these organic compounds, metals form complexes with organic ligands.
    (77) Although metal concentrations of specific species can be determined by inductively
    coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), this analysis provides an incomplete
    picture of how metals will behave in the environment with complexation impacting
    both mobility and toxicity. Therefore, a similar suite of instruments may be required
    to further characterize metals in MWRC. (78) In lieu of a high-resolution characterizations
    of MWRC, it may be more practical to target a diverse set of micropollutants and
    metals as proxy compounds using established techniques. (79,80) However, the availability
    of analytical instrumentation and technical expertise in reuse municipalities
    should not be assumed and is currently a barrier for establishing effective monitoring
    programs. Fortunately, monitoring nutrients is more straightforward, with well-established
    procedures to measure nitrogen and phosphorus typically incorporated into preexisting
    monitoring programs at wastewater treatment plants. (81) To improve the utility
    of these monitoring techniques, automation and artificial intelligence will likely
    play a significant role in reducing the cost and increasing the accessibility
    of many of these analyses, which is why this is an active area of research. (82,83)
    Fluorescence spectroscopy is gaining prominence as an inexpensive, noninvasive,
    and highly sensitive characterization technique that can provide real-time data
    on the organic constituents for secondary wastewater effluent. (84−86) Fluorescence
    spectroscopy uses high-energy light to excite electrons and cause fluorescence
    of specific molecules or moieties. (87) The resulting emissions can be organized
    into excitation–emission matrices (EEM) or synchronous fluorescence spectra (SFS)
    that provide information about the composition and structure of organic constituents
    that may be present in MWRC. (88,89) While fluorescence spectroscopy has been
    shown to correlate well with bulk measurements like BOD, COD, and TOC, peak overlap
    of fluorophores makes source apportionment of specific micropollutants difficult.
    (90) Furthermore, the total analysis of all fluorophores can make it difficult
    to extract information about specific micropollutants or heavy metal complexes.
    (91) However, the detection capabilities of fluorescence spectroscopy are improving,
    especially as this technique is validated alongside other analytical techniques
    (e.g., LC-MS, GC-MS, NMR). Furthermore, artificial intelligence is even being
    used to improve data analysis by increasing the accuracy of constituent identification
    and expanding feature interpretation of the fluorescence spectra. (76,92) Bioassays
    to determine the adverse biological effects on living organisms may prove to be
    useful tools for the direct monitoring of MWRC. Deviating from the methods described
    thus far, this effect-based approach to monitoring focuses on the outcome of MWRC
    exposure as opposed to the chemical composition. (93) Relying on in vitro (on
    a culture dish, typically with cells) or in vivo (in a biological host, e.g.,
    daphnia, zebrafish) techniques, these bioassays can be used to determine toxicity,
    mutagenicity, genotoxicity, and physical stress response of living organisms.
    (94) Bioassays can be run with raw MWRC (demonstrating a worst-case scenario)
    or diluted MWRC to evaluate ecotoxicity scenarios. Furthermore, effect-directed
    analysis could be run to probe the relationship between biological responses and
    the chemical composition of MWRC (or fractionated MWRC). (95) As a result, these
    analyses may be critical for identifying needs for industrial pretreatment of
    wastewater or post-treatment of MWRC to protect natural ecosystems. However, bioassays
    are time-intensive, require expertise, and─due to the variability in MWRC composition,
    may be difficult to generalize. As a result, research is needed to improve the
    accuracy and rapidity of these techniques so that they can be more easily implemented
    in reuse municipalities. Despite these drawbacks, effect-based methods can form
    the foundation for an ecological monitoring program and inform MWRC regulations
    and management. (96) Especially for discharging MWRC into surface water, ecological
    indicators should be identified that align with uses and values of the water resources
    (e.g., drinking water source, swimming, fishing, biodiversity). Depending on these
    values, relevant biological criteria should be identified for monitoring. For
    example, if the receiving water body is used for fishing, the developmental stages
    of sentinel fish populations would be a key indicator for monitoring the impact
    of MWRC discharge. (97) Furthermore, monitoring algae, aquatic plants, benthic
    organisms, and the presence of stress hormones could provide a more holistic understanding
    of healthy fish communities. (98) For each of the biological criteria, warning,
    unacceptable, and severe thresholds should be defined to prompt corrective actions
    and safeguard the environment receiving MWRC. (99) Although ecological monitoring
    faces the same hurdles as holistic chemical analyses and effect-based bioassays
    (i.e., expensive, time-intensive, and requiring specific expertise), these responsibilities
    could be shared with other governing bodies that manage the same water resources
    (e.g., fishery oversight board). This underscores the importance of sharing data,
    not only to ensure the safe discharge of MWRC, but also to help researchers elucidate
    the connections between chemical composition, biotoxicity, and ecological response
    (Figure 3). Figure 3 Figure 3. Composition of MWRC can be extrapolated from the
    composition of the secondary effluent, which is likely being monitored in compliance
    with water reuse programs. In secondary effluent, it is especially important to
    analyze for metals and micropollutants due to the elevate risk they pose to environmental
    systems. Meanwhile, MWRC should be evaluated using bioassays to identify any adverse
    biological effects on living organisms, whereas effect-based monitoring should
    be used to monitor ecosystem health of the MWRC-receiving environment. In conjunction
    with MWRC monitoring, effective MWRC regulations begin with enhanced sewershed
    protection, facilitated by general permits, and empowered by strengthened public
    relations. Easing the Cost of MWRC Regulations Affordability is a critical consideration
    when designing regulations that impact MWRC management, especially because of
    the cost that this may add to implementing reuse. Furthermore, there are many
    examples around the world of how to reduce or spread these costs while still prioritizing
    social and environmental outcomes. The first recommendation is to simplify the
    permitting process through the creation of general permits. Unlike individual
    permits, where dischargers are approved on a case-by-case basis, general permits
    allow dischargers to enroll if they satisfy the requirements of the permit. Despite
    their name, general permits should be adaptable to enable site-specificity. Dilution
    factors─or the assumed dilution that is applied to regulating brines, typically
    when discharging to the ocean─provide an example of how to achieve this balance.
    These dilution factors are typically determined through a mixing study or by use
    of approved hydrodynamic models, allowing for a more accurate calculation of concentration
    at the edge of a designated mixing zone. (100) This is an example of how general
    permits can be site-specific and reflect the physical realities of the receiving
    water body. (101,102) Moreover, general permits should be designed to foster collaboration
    between discharging entities to achieve collective goals. The Hunter River Salinity
    Trading Scheme in Australia provides an example, where various dischargers were
    provided tradeable credits to discharge TDS into the Hunter River depending on
    the river’s flow. (103) This scheme not only reduced the occurrence of salinity
    “hot spots” but also encouraged intrabasin collaboration and stakeholder engagement.
    (104) It should be noted that the Hunter River Salinity Trading Scheme relies
    on extensive monitoring of this important waterway, underscoring the importance
    of expanding water monitoring beyond the point of discharge. The second recommendation
    is for industries connected to the sewer system upstream of a reuse municipality
    to share the burden of treatment (and cost), especially for recalcitrant micropollutants
    that they are responsible for introducing into the sewer system. Treating these
    contaminants at the source of production is likely to achieve higher treatment
    efficacy as the target contaminants are most concentrated and isolated before
    mixing with other sewage. Typically regulated through industrial pretreatment
    programs, an enhanced sewer source (or “sewershed”) protection entreats industries
    to pretreat their wastewater before discharging into the sewer. (105,106) Although
    past applications of sewershed protection have focused on protecting drinking
    water quality from reuse, enhanced sewershed protection has the expanded goal
    of reducing the cost of MWRC management. Furthermore, the stewardship of recalcitrant
    micropollutants should also extend beyond the parent compound to transformation
    products that are likely to arise in wastewater treatment and the natural environment.
    (107−109) In addition to enacting at the industrial level, enhanced sewershed
    protection should also be applied to consumer products. A key limitation of industrial
    pretreatment programs is an inability to regulate nonpoint-source introduction
    of chemicals (i.e., from residential households). This was the case in Israel
    in the late 1990s, where 80% of municipal wastewater was being reuse for agriculture
    and other nonpotable applications. (110) As TDS (especially boron) can have an
    adverse effect on crop growth, the Israeli government regulated the amount of
    boron, sodium, and chloride that could be in domestic and industrial detergents.
    (111,112) While this may be challenging for some dischargers (e.g., pharmaceuticals
    and hospitals) where active ingredients may be difficult to substitute, industries
    should still partner with wastewater and reuse municipalities to identify opportunities
    to facilitate enhanced sewershed protection. However, there is currently little
    incentive to do this. A key challenge with industrial pretreatment programs is
    that the responsibility of enforcement falls on the wastewater municipality, which
    may lack the resources and legal authority needed to ensure sufficient compliance,
    particularly in the case of unregulated or emerging contaminants. (113) To aid
    municipalities, research is needed to develop forensic methods for tracing the
    source of micropollutants that are accurate, timely, and affordable. (114) The
    third recommendation to reduce the costs for reused municipalities is strengthening
    relations with the public they serve. Water resources may hold significance for
    people for a wide range of reasons, including water supply, recreation, wildlife
    habitat, and cultural. (71) Therefore, the optimal MWRC management strategy may
    depend on how well that strategy aligns with the values held by their constituents.
    For example, in Switzerland, concerns about pharmaceuticals in drinking water
    and the environment prompted government action to upgrade wastewater treatment
    plants to reduce the discharge of micropollutants in 2014. In addition to government
    funding, these upgrades were also supported by increases in the cost of wastewater
    services of 10–50%. (115) Although traditionally a source of public tension, these
    rate increases were determined after extensive public consultation and passed
    due to alignment with held values. (116,117) This public outreach can also be
    considered a form of institutional work that contributed to this project achieving
    legitimacy. (118) According to institutional theory, various forms of institutional
    work─including advocacy, political work, changing normative associations, constructing
    normative networks, mimicry, theorizing, educating, valorizing and demonizing,
    mythologizing, and imagery─are required at different phases of the legitimation
    process (i.e., innovation and local validation, diffusion, general validation).
    (119,120) This legitimacy framework has been applied to study a variety of systems
    from the influence of water scarcity on fluctuating demand for seawater desalination
    in Australia to the proliferation of water reuse in California. (118,121) However,
    more research is needed to identify opportunities for institutional work that
    can inform actionable strategies for reuse municipalities to legitimize emerging
    MWRC management approaches. (Re)Defining Valorization for MWRC ARTICLE SECTIONSJump
    To The economic viability of any infrastructure project is often evaluated using
    cost-benefit analysis (CBA), where the costs of investing in a water project are
    compared with the monetary benefits. As costs and benefits are incurred at different
    points in time, the net present value (NPV) is often used to compare the current
    value of these future monetary streams. (122) NPV is calculated by NPV= ∑ 𝑡=0
    𝑛 𝐵(𝑡)−𝐶(𝑡) (1+𝑖) 𝑛 n where B(t) and C(t) are the annual rates of benefits and
    costs as a function of time, respectively, i is the discount rate (typically set
    to between 5% and 7%), and n is the projected lifespan of the project (typically
    30–50 years for new projects and 10–25 years for retrofits). The present value
    for both benefits and costs accounts for the fact that fixed monetary streams
    generally decrease in value over time due to positive interest rates. The net
    present value, therefore, is the difference between benefit and cost monetary
    streams over the lifespan of the project, which should be greater than 0 for projects
    to be deemed net beneficial. To help tip the scales of CBA, there is growing interest
    in augmenting benefits through resource recovery from wastewater. (123,124) Which
    “Resources” are Worth Recovering from MWRC? Wastewater valorization is the process
    of deriving additional value from wastewater, its constituents, or its properties.
    Based on this definition, resource recovery is a form of wastewater valorization
    that focuses on recovering and selling specific constituents from wastewater or
    products derived from those constituents. Resource recovery from municipal wastewater
    streams has the potential to remove pollutants that would otherwise be discharged
    into the environment as well as expand benefit streams to improve CBA prospects.
    Importantly, resource recovery would displace more environmentally damaging mining,
    petrochemical, or chemical-processing industries associated with conventional
    practices for obtaining these resources. MWRC─with potentially recoverable constituents
    from secondary effluent having been concentrated 5–6-fold─would appear to be a
    logical wastewater stream for resource recovery. However, the MWRC has undergone
    ultrafiltration, removing coagulated nutrients and particulate organic matter.
    Furthermore, all aqueous species─including interfering constituents like dissolved
    organics that chelate to metals and antiscalants that prevent precipitation of
    minerals─have also been concentrated, which can significantly reduce the recovery
    efficiency for extracting a specific constituent of interest. As a result, without
    the reconfiguration of upstream wastewater treatment processes or specialized
    pretreatment, the prospects of resource recovery from MWRC are like to be low.
    (125−127) While the prospects of resource recovery from MWRC are like to be low,
    this does not mean that there is nothing to be valorized from MWRC. As previously
    discussed, the direct use of MWRC for irrigation, aquaculture, or algaculture
    can serve as a multibeneficial form of MWRC disposal. (57) Furthermore, the advent
    of MLD technologies are lowering the cost associated with achieving higher water
    recoveries from MWRC. Although municipal reuse might not justify the cost of implementing
    MLD, additional postprocessing of this high-purity water could be used to meet
    water quality criteria for specific industries. Known as “fit-for-purpose” this
    water can be sold at a premium, while reducing the volume of MWRC that needs to
    be managed. (128) However, it is essential to ensure that fit-for-purpose water
    meets an actual demand in an accessible market and that MLD and postprocessing
    technologies are designed to be agile enough to meet constantly changing market
    demands. Valorizing MWRC Management Services Beyond resource recovery, there are
    a wide range of ancillary benefits to the proper management of the MWRC that have
    already been discussed. Nature-based treatment systems for MWRC disposal not only
    support habitats for biodiversity but can also provide aesthetic spaces for recreation.
    (60,62) Additionally, expanding ZLD to facilitate the destruction of micropollutants
    in MWRC can result in significant damages avoided in the future. (129) Lastly,
    the data generated both from wastewater and natural ecosystem monitoring programs
    can have important implications for public and environmental health. (108) Another
    benefit of MWRC management is enabling the adoption of reuse into new regions
    where MWRC disposal is the cost-limiting factor. Depending on how water reuse
    is implemented, reclaimed water has been used to prevent seawater intrusion, impede
    land subsidence, and disrupt the formation of harmful algal blooms. (8,130,131)
    Most of all, water reuse can be a reliable, decentralized water source that has
    been viewed as a form of “drought insurance” and offers reuse municipalities flexibility,
    resiliency, and independence to adapt to climate change. (132,133) However, many
    of these benefits (and costs) go unaccounted for in CBA because they are either
    “incommensurable” or “intangible”. Incommensurable benefits can be physically
    measured but it is difficult to assign these benefits a monetary value (e.g.,
    water scarcity, pollution), whereas intangible benefits cannot be physically measured
    or assigned a monetary value (e.g., aesthetic beauty, resilience). (134) Although
    physical measurements or qualitative assessments of these benefits can be included
    in CBA, a lack of comparable monetary quantities cause these nonmarket services
    to be undervalued. (135) To help bridge this gap, contingent valuation has been
    used to ascertain monetary values of social and environmental benefits. (136)
    This surveying method uses hypothetical scenarios to probe the willingness to
    pay for specific benefits or willingness to accept compensation for specific losses.
    (137) However, by relying on stated preference to assign values to these nonmarket
    services, this technique is susceptible to biases (e.g., hypothetical bias, social
    desirability, lack of familiarity bias). (138) Alternatively, revealed preference
    methods infer the value of nonmarket services by monitoring the behavior of related
    market transactions. Examples of revealed preference methods include “hedonic
    pricing”, where changes in the price of a market good are correlated to an underlying
    nonmarket service (e.g., using differences in housing prices to infer air quality),
    and the “travel cost method” where the distance traveled to experience a nonmarket
    service is correlated to its value (e.g., traveling to a MWRC-fed wetland for
    birdwatching). (139) However, revealed preference methods are limited by the availability
    of relevant data and the confounding factors that impact behavior. (140) Although
    these methods are imperfect (and tend to be human-centric), any attempt to more
    holistically account for benefits is better than disregarding them from CBA altogether,
    which is why research is still needed on applying these methods to the valuation
    of MWRC management services. Moreover, increasing the value of benefits for MWRC
    management can have only a limited impact unless the other fundamental aspects
    of CBA are addressed. Revamping Cost-Benefit Analysis The formulation previously
    discussed for CBA presents several challenges for many infrastructure projects
    including MWRC management. The first challenge is the “lag time” associated with
    permitting and construction before the streams of benefits begin to incur. As
    a result, discount rates disproportionately reduce the value of these delayed
    benefit streams over cost streams, which favor retrofits over new constructions
    to reduce the lag time. The second challenge is that the time horizon used for
    cost-benefit analyses is often too short for long-term benefits to materialize.
    For example, a 6% discount rate causes the present value of benefits to decrease
    to less than 20% of their original value after 30 years, rendering long-term benefits
    effectively negligible. (141) This incentivizes near-sighted cost-saving (or cost-externalizing)
    measures, like the use of carbon-intensive or environmentally damaging practices
    where the full costs may be unknown and difficult to measure. (142) The third
    challenge is that publicly owned reuse municipalities are oftentimes prohibited
    from making a profit and have to provide their services at-cost. While this regulation
    safeguards affordable water prices, it hinders the ability of reuse municipalities
    to generate revenue and can undermine long-term solvency. (143−145) As a result,
    revamping how discount rates and time horizons are used is potentially more impactful
    to CBA determinations (Figure 4). (142,146) Higher discount rates (5–7%) have
    been traditionally used in CBA for reasons ranging from uncertainty about long-term
    benefits to priority of immediate social needs. As previously discussed, these
    high discount rates render long-term benefits beyond 30 years effectively negligible.
    This is often the justification for using shorter time horizons, despite the projected
    lifespan of infrastructure projects (30–50 years) and even longer implications
    this infrastructure may have on the environment. (142) Furthermore, high discount
    rates carry an ethical implication that the welfare of people alive today is more
    important than the welfare of people in the future. (146) As a result, CBA favors
    projects that produce benefits in the short term and externalize costs that manifest
    in the long term. Figure 4 Figure 4. As observed by the “traditional valorization”,
    discount rates used in cost-benefit analysis (CBA) cause the value of benefits
    to decrease over time (i.e., years). While resource recovery and, to a greater
    extent, the valorization of MWRC management services can increase the stream of
    benefits in CBA, the underlying mechanics of how CBAs are conducted (specifically
    discount rates and time horizons) need to be revamped to improve the CBA prospects
    of MWRC management. Many of the benefits of proper MWRC management that have been
    discussed begin to accrue in the long term or support complex ecosystems services
    that grow nonlinearly with time. (147) To better capture the value of the benefits
    in CBA, the use of longer time horizons with lower discount rates are recommended.
    Prioritizing intergenerational equity, strong cases have been made to use low
    (and even zero) discount rates. However, to balance short-term costs with long-term
    benefits, the use of time-dependent discount rates is recommended. These include
    declining or hyperbolic discount rates that preserve the value of long-term benefits
    by reducing the discount rate over an appropriate time scale. For example, the
    United Kingdom uses a discount rate of 3.5% for the short- and medium-term, but
    a discount rate of 1% after 300 years. (148) Another technique is differential
    discounting, where distinct discount rates are applied to different costs and
    benefits independently. Similarly, the time horizon for analysis can also be varied
    to look at the financial analysis period (∼30 years), the technically useful or
    physical lifetime of the project (30–100 years), and the welfare impact horizon
    (100 years and beyond). (142) Although this makes the CBA more complicated, it
    can also allow for a more targeted sensitivity analysis, where the effect of discount
    rates and time horizons on specific costs and benefits can be evaluated. (149)
    Further research is needed to demonstrate the effect of modifying discount rates
    and time horizons on the CBA prospects of various MWRC management options. While
    these techniques can be applied to all kinds of infrastructure projects, it is
    particularly important to incorporate them into how we evaluate MWRC management
    because of the critical role water reuse will play in creating resilient water
    systems. Outlook for MWRC Management ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To As the water infrastructure
    built in the 20th century reaches the end of its operational lifespan, there is
    an opportunity to build something better. Treatment technologies have improved
    to enhance the mitigation of pollutants while lowering energy requirements. Analytical
    techniques have deepened our understanding not only about the chemical and biological
    composition of wastewaters but also the impact on human and environmental health.
    Additionally, policy tools can enable cost-effective decisions that prioritize
    both resilience and equity. While these advancements will aid in the transition
    to a One Water Cycle─where improved water supplies and reduced environmental burden
    can be simultaneously achieved through expansion of water reuse─ultimately the
    ability to implement reuse is contingent on options for MWRC management. (12)
    Essential to the development and implementation of MWRC management practices is
    collaboration. This review attempted to bring together insights, tools, and frameworks
    from a wide range of disciplines, including engineering, chemistry, microbiology,
    ecology, economics, public policy, and other fields of social science. Furthermore,
    MWRC management lies at the intersection of multiple sectors including municipalities,
    regulators, industries, and the environment. Fortunately, there is already a thriving
    intellectual ecosystem for water reuse, supported by institutional actors that
    fund research, formalize expertise, and organize annual conferences. (118) These
    activities have been successful in legitimizing water reuse (especially in the
    United States), but as water reuse practices become more widespread, greater attention
    should be paid to advancing MWRC management. As there are currently only a few
    examples of MWRC management, data sharing and case studies are needed that showcase
    how context-specific factors inform MWRC management and monitoring strategies.
    Not only can this information be used to build frameworks to assist municipalities
    considering water reuse weigh different MWRC management options, but this would
    also help generalize MWRC management practices to be more broadly applicable for
    different international contexts. Although MWRC management focuses on the wastewater
    specifically from water reuse activities, as our water infrastructure evolves
    into the One Water Cycle, MWRC management becomes the future of all wastewater
    management. As a result, the future of MWRC management is not just an opportunity
    but a fundamental obligation to take full responsibility over the wastewater we
    produce. Building on ideas presented in this review, MWRC management can serve
    as the first steps toward the comprehensive treatment of micropollutants and harmonizing
    of our built infrastructure with natural ecosystems. Moreover, MWRC management
    has a pivotal role in increasing climate resilience and ensuring equitable outcomes
    for our water infrastructure. To realize this potential, it is imperative that
    we harness the collective insights and diverse perspectives of researchers, practitioners,
    and stakeholders from all sectors into the development of the emerging field of
    MWRC management. Author Information ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To Corresponding Author

    Abstract Figure 1 Figure 1. Cycle of municipal wastewater reuse and the corresponding
    production of municipal wastewater reuse concentrate (MWRC). Today, advanced wastewater
    treatment for reuse typically involves ultrafiltration (UF), reverse osmosis (RO),
    and advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). The generation of MWRC is inherent in
    the operation of RO, which recovers 80–85% of its inflow but concentrates most
    dissolved contaminants into the MWRC waste stream that comprises the remaining
    15–20% of flow. MWRC differs from other reverse osmosis concentrates because it
    contains elevated concentrations of contaminants specific to municipal wastewater,
    including total dissolved solids (TDS), metals, nutrients, and micropollutants.
    As water reuse practices become more widespread, the generation of MWRC will also
    increase. Therefore, challenges and opportunities for the future management of
    MWRC need to be explored. Figure 2 Figure 2. The interconnected categories of
    MWRC management include conveyance (e.g., brine lines, sewer disposal), artificial
    end points (e.g., evaporation ponds, MLD, and ZLD), and environmental end points
    (e.g., surface water outfall, well injection, and land application). Artificial
    end points are distinct from environmental end points in that they are still engineered
    systems that do not discharge to the environment until solid waste is produced
    and typically disposed of by landfill. Nature-based treatment systems, direct
    use via land application, and MLD/ZLD are highlighted because they offer multibenefits
    in addition to MWRC disposal. Figure 3 Figure 3. Composition of MWRC can be extrapolated
    from the composition of the secondary effluent, which is likely being monitored
    in compliance with water reuse programs. In secondary effluent, it is especially
    important to analyze for metals and micropollutants due to the elevate risk they
    pose to environmental systems. Meanwhile, MWRC should be evaluated using bioassays
    to identify any adverse biological effects on living organisms, whereas effect-based
    monitoring should be used to monitor ecosystem health of the MWRC-receiving environment.
    In conjunction with MWRC monitoring, effective MWRC regulations begin with enhanced
    sewershed protection, facilitated by general permits, and empowered by strengthened
    public relations. Figure 4 Figure 4. As observed by the “traditional valorization”,
    discount rates used in cost-benefit analysis (CBA) cause the value of benefits
    to decrease over time (i.e., years). While resource recovery and, to a greater
    extent, the valorization of MWRC management services can increase the stream of
    benefits in CBA, the underlying mechanics of how CBAs are conducted (specifically
    discount rates and time horizons) need to be revamped to improve the CBA prospects
    of MWRC management. Partners 1155 Sixteenth Street N.W. Washington, DC 20036 Copyright

  description: Digital twins provide insights into physical objects by serving as
    advanced virtual representations. Their sensors capture detailed information about
    an object's functionality through their use of various sensors. It is possible
    to gain a deep understanding of the object's performance and potential areas for
    improvement by collecting data, which includes metrics such as energy output,
    temperature, and weather conditions. Digital twins are becoming important in a
    variety of research and industrial application sectors as production lines and
    processes become more digitalized and as improved data analysis techniques such
    as machine learning and enhanced visualization techniques are used. There is no
    unified definition of the digital twin concept in scientific literature, which
    results in imprecise applications and the weakening of its terminology. However,
    this study demonstrates how digital twin models can be applied to urban drainage

    'Providing user-friendly interfaces (e.g., mobile apps, web dashboards) for farmers
    to input preferences, constraints, and expert knowledge into the automated irrigation
    system, using techniques like participatory design or user-centered design' relates
    to the outline point and review intention from the review. The specific point
    focus is about the use of user-friendly interfaces to incorporate farmer input
    into automated irrigation systems. The outline point and review intention is to
    identify and review literature that focuses on strategies for ensuring the robustness
    and reliability of automated systems for real-time irrigation management, including
    resilience and fault tolerance, advanced monitoring techniques, closed-loop control,
    and addressing security concerns and risks in large-scale deployments.

    intelligenceSensor technologySmart city 1. Introduction The idea of the digital
    twin has been crucial in aiding engineers with the creation and oversight of complex
    systems as an outcome of model-based engineering [1]. In this method, physical
    twins are paired with virtual twins (digital representations of essential aspects
    and behaviors of the system, often implemented as software agents) as described
    in [2]. A digital twin facilitates the assessment of feasibility during the requirements
    analysis and initiation phase by enabling trade-off analysis and experimentation
    without requiring the actual operation of the system. The virtual twin aids in
    delineating specifications and removing ambiguity throughout the development process.
    Sensors connect the physical system to its virtual counterpart for real-time monitoring
    and enhancement of the physical system using the digital twin’s data and longitudinal
    analysis [3]. More examples of digital twin applications in cities have been provided
    in recent review publications [4], [5]. Numerous cases have been reported where
    single-metric solutions have been used to solve problems, such as streamlining
    production lines [6], managing wastewater [7], maintaining vehicles [8], and others.
    The digital twin technology has recently drawn attention for its potential in
    mass personalization, particularly in relation to distinctive wetland habitats
    [9]. While most of the earlier research on the subject of the digital twin focused
    on manufacturing, recent studies have explored the relationship between the digital
    twin and mass individualization in order to develop a com- prehensive reference
    architecture for digital twin applications [10]. A Digital Twin as a Service (DTaaS)
    model demonstrated notable benefits in several industries, such as smart planned
    maintenance, real-time monitoring, remote control, and predictive functions [11].
    New capabilities are set to be added to the AQUADVANCED® Water Networks “Distribution”
    software, which is essential for managing drinking water distribution systems.
    Thousands of users will benefit from these upgrades before the summer of 2022,
    not only in France but globally as well [12]. Using artificial intelligence (AI)
    in digital twin models for smart cities can enhance the efficiency and sustainability
    of stormwater systems. A digital twin model that incorporates AI techniques can
    provide valuable insights for decision- makers and stakeholders, enabling them
    to make informed decisions regarding infrastructure planning, design, and maintenance.
    1. AI algorithms, such as machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), can process
    vast amounts of data from various sources, including sensors, weather forecasts,
    and historical data. This enables the digital twin to make accurate predictions
    about stormwater flow, system performance, and potential issues. Consequently,
    decision-makers can proactively address potential problems and optimize system
    operations. 2. AI-enhanced digital twin models can dynamically adjust the stormwater
    infrastructure''s operation based on real-time data and predictions. This includes
    controlling retention basins, gates, and pumps, allowing for adaptive responses
    to changing weather conditions, and preventing flooding or damage to infrastructure.
    3. AI-powered digital twins can analyze data to identify patterns and trends in
    system performance, enabling predictive maintenance. By identifying areas requiring
    attention before failure occurs, maintenance efforts can be focused where needed
    most, reducing costs, and minimizing disruptions to the system. 4. AI algorithms
    can help identify the best solutions for multiple, often conflicting, objectives
    within stormwater infrastructure systems. This includes balancing water quality,
    flood mitigation, and cost-effectiveness while considering environmental and social
    impacts. The digital twin model can analyze various scenarios and provide decision-makers
    with optimal solutions based on the desired outcomes. 5. Digital twin models enhanced
    with AI can provide visualizations and simu- lation, enabling stakeholders to
    better understand the system''s performance and potential impacts. This promotes
    more effective communication, collab- oration, and decision-making among various
    parties involved in stormwater management. Integrating AI into digital twin models
    for stormwater infrastructure systems, smart cities can better manage and optimize
    their resources, ultimately improv- ing urban resilience and sustainability. As
    AI technology continues to advance, digital twin models will likely play an increasingly
    important role in addressing complex urban challenges, such as stormwater management,
    in an increasingly interconnected world. This paper explores the integration of
    Artificial Intelli- gence into Digital Twin models to enhance stormwater infrastructure
    systems within smart cities. With a focus on urban drainage systems, it provides
    an analysis of the current state of digital twin technology. Reviewing and organizing
    existing literature on smart stormwater management, the study clarifies terminology
    and practices. Case studies from various cities demonstrate how digital twins
    can be used to manage urban water systems practically. As well as identifying
    key research areas, the paper emphasizes how AI can revolutionize stormwater management
    in smart urban environments. An overview of digital twins and their importance
    in smart cities is presented in the introduction, along with information on how
    AI can enhance stormwater systems. A description of the literature review process
    and the time frame of selected publications is presented in the methodology section.
    A detailed examination of the technologies fundamental to digital twin models
    follows a detailed examination of how digital twin models integrate with AI. After
    discussing characteristics, terminology, optimization of Smart Water Management
    (SWM), short-term forecasting, decentralized systems, and the role of AI in stormwater
    management, the paper explores the application of digital twins in smart cities.
    The subsequent sections analyze the implementation of digital twins and the role
    of AI in cities such as Helsinki, Zurich, and Vienna. An examination of digital
    twins’ contributions to green infrastructure planning is included in one section,
    while another focuses on digital twin modeling and real-time data visualization.
    In a conclusion section, the paper examines the current state of digital twin
    technology, its potential limitations, and the implications for future research
    on AI-enhanced digital twin models for smart cities’ stormwater infrastructure.
    2. The literature review methodology Considering the recent developments in AI
    applications within Digital Twin models for stormwater infrastructure in smart
    cities, our methodology incorporates a literature review and a case study analysis.
    It ensures a rigorous examination of both theoretical insights and practical applications
    by exploring the field. We reviewed the literature using prominent databases,
    including Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science, chosen for their extensive
    coverage across interdisciplinary research areas relevant to our subject matter.
    As part of our search strategy, we used terms such as “digital twin,” “AI in urban
    water management,” “smart city infrastructure,” and “stormwater system modeling”
    in combination with Boolean operators and specific filters (e.g., publication
    years 2015 to 2023) to identify the most relevant studies. A two-stage screening
    process - reviewing titles and abstracts, followed by a full-text review based
    on inclusion criteria such as relevance, contribution to the field, and citation
    impact - ensured that noteworthy works were included. Using a thematic analysis,
    key information was systematically gathered from the selected publications and
    synthesized. Through this process, core themes, challenges, and opportunities
    in leveraging AI for digital twins in managing stormwater systems were identified,
    bridging theoretical knowledge with practical insights. In addition, we highlighted
    the global application of digital twins in various geographic locations and urban
    environments because of our case study analysis. Academic journals, municipal
    reports, and project documents were consulted when selecting these case studies
    for their innovation, maturity, and depth of information. We examined how these
    practical applications addressed challenges and opportunities identified in the
    literature, providing a real-world perspective on theoretical findings. Based
    on insights from the literature re- view and observations from case studies, we
    were able to construct a nuanced understanding of the current state and future
    directions for AI in stormwater infrastructure digital twins. Besides providing
    an overview, this methodology also identified common challenges such as data integration
    issues and model accuracy, as well as opportunities such as enhanced decision-making
    capability and operational efficiency. Its strength lies in the systematic and
    rigorous examination it facilitates, combining the depth of literature review
    with the breadth of case study analysis. Despite this, we acknowledge that there
    may be limitations, such as database selection bias and publication bias inherent
    in the method. In order to address these concerns, future research could include
    additional databases and grey literature. As a result of using this structured,
    yet integrated methodology, we ensured an exploration of AI applications in digital
    twins for stormwater management, contributing valuable knowledge to the field
    and addressing the research question in its entirety. 3. Technologies that enable
    digital twin A city is composed of several blocks or neighborhoods that are distinguished
    by their social and technical characteristics. In smart buildings, rooms may contain
    devices affected by the environment, with additional interconnections like those
    in smart cities where power consumption reduction is linked to device usage, competing
    with, or aligned with room controls. A planner is more concerned with the consequences
    of their execution than with offering smart equipment. The second problem is to
    build realistic representations of the city and its components after embracing
    the idea of a multi-scale, multi-attribute, multi-objective, complex, sociotechnical
    system. Fig. 1 illustrates the digital twins of urban physical assets. An image
    of the physical city is depicted on the left, along with its buildings, supporting
    infrastructure, and citizens, while organizations and corporations are represented
    on the right, along with technical sensors and their derived metrics. For planning
    and governance, the digital twin ensemble provides computational decision support.
    In the lower part of Fig. 1, you can see how the interaction of crucial standards,
    metrics, and methods is illustrated. These benchmarks, measures, and techniques,
    which may be used in both physical and virtual contexts, are developed from green
    best practices. In the sections that follow, these ideas in greater detail are
    examined, as well as the standards shown in Fig. 1. In the rapidly evolving economy
    of today, organizations must prioritize sustainability in order to maintain a
    competitive edge, as illustrated in Fig. 2. Sustainable practices can reduce costs,
    enhance safety and security, and improve employee well-being [14]. Moreover, being
    green enhances an organization’s brand image, contributing to talent recruitment
    and employee retention [15], [16]. Despite increased awareness and acceptability,
    firms'' sustainability activities are not assessed using a single, widely accepted
    set of indicators. These metrics serve as the basis for creating rules and regulations
    in addition to being crucial for monitoring and evaluating businesses and their
    operations. Fig. 2 illustrates a preliminary definition of the structure of an
    urban digital twin by examining the physical city as the field in which finite
    quantities of resources flow among a wide range of agents, each with a different
    degree of influence over public policy decisions, with effects on each of these
    agents in terms of their quality of life. There is no doubt that the regulatory
    framework plays a important role in this matter. Download : Download high-res

    full-size image Fig. 2. The urban digital twin as model of physical objects and
    urban agents [17]. The urban digital twin as a model of physical objects and urban
    agents is shown in Fig. 2. The digital twin is developed and managed through a
    range of technological innovations that capture, process, and display data. Digital
    twins are supported by a set of fundamental elements already present in many organizations
    today, providing operational and data processing support. These digital twins
    are a class of emerging technologies typically implemented during an organization’s
    digital transformation process, allowing them to reach their full potential as
    comprehensive, live data models spanning various resources. Key technologies that
    form the foundation of the digital twin system include the Internet of Things
    (IoT), 5G technology, AI and Big Data Analytics, Visualization Tools, Digital
    Platforms, Social Sensing, Participatory Sensing, Spatio-temporal fluctuation,
    Semantic Model Approach, ML Approach, and Energy Bench- marking Approach, among
    others. IoT, a network of interconnected devices equipped with sensors, software,
    and other technologies, enables interaction and information exchange with various
    systems and platforms over the Internet. Equipment monitoring via IoT helps construction
    firms track usage, manage costs, and make informed decisions. Cloud computing
    and real-time monitoring assist in reducing theft, enhancing efficiency, and controlling
    resource expenses. 5G technology serves as an integral digital twin accelerator,
    offering ultra-high speeds, rapid response times, and the capacity to support
    high device densities. With constantly changing construction site environments,
    teams can leverage 5G to monitor real-time activities and execute virtual or autonomous
    construction operations. This technology enables seamless access to data-intensive
    edge and cloud applications, facilitating real-time communication among users
    globally [19]. Digital twin technology relies heavily on AI and big data analytics.
    The use of AI aids city managers in making informed decisions and automating operational
    tasks when combined with analytical tools. An audio sensor within the city infrastructure,
    for example, could alert operations center personnel to an incident and suggest
    potential responses. Drones can also be automatically activated by such sensors.
    The emergence of automation in construction relies on AI and extensive data mining
    technology [20]. In addition to digital twins, visualization tools play an important
    role as well. The main components of digital twins are real-time operation centers
    with video walls and 3D simulation software like BIM. These tools can be enhanced
    with augmented reality and virtual reality technologies, enhancing their accuracy
    and utility. Additionally, these technologies have impactful implications for
    operations, training architecture, and simulation. The Digital Platform connects
    all previously mentioned technologies, linking applications and data to eliminate
    the need for storage facilities. The platform also connects various businesses
    and socioeconomic and educational sectors, enabling an exploration of the ecosystem
    and surpassing individual system capabilities. Social sensing involves various
    sensing paradigms wherein data is collected on behalf of humans or computers.
    Mobile sensing devices are crucial in social sensing to monitor and sense mobile
    targets. Social sensing generally encompasses three types of data collection:
    participatory sensing, opportunistic sensing, and social data scavenging. Participatory
    sensing involves individuals actively participating in the sensing process and
    performing specific tasks essential for meeting application requirements [13],
    [21]. Spatiotemporal fluctuation measures landscape changes based on change patterns.
    These metrics indicate landscape structure changes in various ways, while the
    direction and frequency of fluctuations reveal spatial variations. This helps
    identify physical vulnerabilities that may cause hazards and risks in construction
    [21]. The semantic data model is a conceptual data model containing semantic information
    that imparts significant meaning to data and relationships among them. A semantic
    approach to information processing and execution implicitly defines the purpose
    of represented knowledge using semantic settings and prior information [22]. The
    goal of ML is to enable computers to adapt and improve based on experience, rather
    than directly programmable instructions. Computer systems that are capable of
    acquiring and interpreting data for self-learning are being developed. As a method
    to assess the energy efficiency of buildings over time by comparing them to other
    similar structures or modeled simulation of a reference building designed to meet
    specific standards, benchmarking, a method that compares one or more aspects of
    products, services, and strategies against industry-leading organizations, is
    applied to building energy consumption. Benchmarking is an effective tool for
    gauging the energy efficiency of buildings and identifying areas for improvement
    when it is applied to their energy consumption. Therefore, the digital twin concept
    utilizes a combination of advanced technologies such as IoT, 5G, AI, Big Data
    Analytics, Visualization Tools, Digital Platforms, Social Sensing, spatial–temporal
    fluctuations, Semantic Model Approach, ML Approach, and Energy Benchmarking Approach
    to create a comprehensive, real-time data model. The combination of these technologies
    enhances decision-making, optimizes resource utilization, and improves overall
    efficiency in the number of industries, including construction and urban planning.
    The use of digital twins will become increasingly important as organizations continue
    to adopt digital transformation processes and embrace emerging technologies. An
    explanation of modeling and visualization techniques is shown in Table 1. Table

    4. Digital twins and smart city A Digital Twin is a simulation technique that
    combines several disciplines, physical qualities, scales, and probabilities using
    physical models, sensors, and historical operational data. This simulation acts
    as a digital depiction of the product throughout its useful life. There are now
    many ways to understand the idea of a digital twin, and there is no agreed-upon
    definition. The physical things, virtual models, data, connections, and services
    make up the digital twin. A digital twin gives a two-way mapping between the real
    and virtual worlds, which is where it differs from a digital shadow. Digital twins,
    unlike digital shadows, enable physical entities to be controlled without human
    intervention [31], a feature not present in digital shadows. A virtual twin enables
    the representation of physical characteristics, structures, states, performance,
    functions, and behaviors of a system in a virtual environment [28], creating a
    dynamic model with high fidelity over a variety of dimensions, scales, and physical
    quantities. The model allows for effective observation, comprehension, control,
    and transformation of the physical world [28], [29]. In cities embracing technological
    advancements and urbanization challenges, humans, infrastructure systems, and
    technologies are increasingly interdependent. As a result of these interdependencies,
    management decisions may be less than ideal, resulting in increased uncertainty
    and inaccurate predictions. To address this problem, city decision-makers must
    change the way they understand, influence, and manage urban infrastructure. A
    Smart City Digital Twin (SCDT) integrates the real and digital worlds through
    iterative, data-driven feedback loops. Virtual reality, augmented reality, and
    mixed reality technologies combine IoT, analytics, and visualization capabilities
    to create a virtual representation of municipal infrastructure [31]. Decision-makers
    may be able to evaluate policies and projects that are driven by the community
    and stakeholder groups thanks to synergistic feedback loops between physical infrastructure
    and human systems. What-if scenarios and emergent behaviors may be used to predict
    how smart cities will function under various economic, environmental, and social
    circumstances. It is crucial to comprehend this idea in order to evaluate the
    success of smart growth initiatives and to close the gap between smart utopia
    and smart reality [32], [33]. The development of such integrated cyber-physical
    city infrastructures requires new technological and methodological advances, as
    well as multidisciplinary collaboration. Digital twin cities will be a “new starting
    point” for innovation in urban management, planning, and services in the development
    of smart cities [34], [35]. As a result, we will be able to visualize all aspects
    of city information and will be able to intelligently plan, manage, and deliver
    services within the city. As a key element of smart cities, digital twin cities
    are not only a goal of digital cities but also a critical component. To become
    smarter, cities must have these facilities and basic capabilities, marking a step
    in the transformation of urban information technology from qualitative to quantitative
    change, which creates greater opportunities for innovation in the development
    of smart cities [36]. 4.1. Characteristics of smart cities based on digital twins
    As a result of diverse perspectives, the concept of the digital twin has been
    interpreted in many ways. In their study, Tao et al. [29] explore various dimensions
    and analyze current understandings of digital twins. In Table 2, they describe
    the five dimensions of an ideal digital twin: model, data, connection, service/function,
    and physical. It has been noted by Tao et al. that digital twins exhibit unique
    characteristics at various stages, so it is important to understand and apply
    digital twins in the context of specific objects, applications, and requirements
    [29], [30], [31]. In real-world implementations, a digital twin need not exhibit
    all ideal traits; satisfying the users'' particular requirements is enough [28],
    [29]. The digital twin city concept, as a broader application of the digital twin
    idea in urban contexts, displays distinct features that originate from the ideal
    attributes of digital twins. Various industries, such as manufacturing, aerospace,
    healthcare, and transportation, have applied digital twin technology in recent
    years implementation of digital twins has led to improved efficiency, reduced
    costs, and enhanced decision-making in these sectors [32]. In the context of smart
    cities, digital twin cities can help with urban planning, resource management,
    traffic control, and environmental monitoring. By incorporating real-time data,
    digital twin cities can optimize infrastructure utilization and maintenance, leading
    to more sustainable urban development. The capabilities of digital twin cities
    can be bolstered by integrating cutting-edge technologies like AI, ML, and big
    data analytics. This enables improved forecasting, optimization, and adaptability
    in response to evolving circumstances [33], [34], [35]. To ensure the successful
    implementation of digital twin cities and to address the diverse needs of urban
    environments, collaboration among stakeholders such as governments, businesses,
    researchers, and citizens will be crucial. Table 2. Varied interpretations of
    the term digital twin. S.No. Perspective Understanding of Digital Twin 1. Representation
    Aspect A digital representation of a physical system or product that captures
    its geometry, composition, and structural behavior. 2. Data Dimension The integration
    of real-time and historical data, enabling continuous updating and synchronization
    of digital twins with its physical counterpart. 3. Linkage Aspect A digital twin''s
    connection and communication with its physical counterpart, as well as with other
    digital twins are seamless. 4. Functional Aspect The digital twin''s capacity
    to provide services and functions, such as predictive maintenance, performance
    optimization, and what-if scenario analysis. 5. Physical Dimension The ability
    of a digital twin to control and influence its physical counterpart, enabling
    real-world changes based on insights and decisions derived from the digital twin.
    Digital twin city consists of precise mapping, virtual-real interaction, software-
    driven representations, and intelligent feedback. Aerial, ground, subterranean,
    and river sensors are used to map urban infrastructure, such as roads, bridges,
    manhole covers, lamps, and buildings [37], [38], [39], [40], [41]. Through this,
    it is possible to gain a complete understanding of the city''s operational status
    as well as a dynamic monitoring of it, which ultimately allows an accurate alignment
    of the virtual city with the physical city in terms of information. A virtual
    model of the physical city can be created by twin cities using software platforms
    that simulate the behavior of urban people, events, and objects in the virtual
    environment [42], [43], [44], [45]. By planning, designing, and simulating the
    digital twin city and proposing reasonable and viable countermeasures, intelligent
    feedback can provide smart early warning of potential negative effects, conflicts,
    and threats within the city. By integrating next-generation technology into the
    basis of the digital twin city, such as Internet of Items, cloud computing, big
    data, and AI, it is feasible to direct and optimize the design and management
    of smart cities [46], [47]. The provision of citizens'' services will be enhanced,
    as well as the development of smart cities will be further assisted [48]. As part
    of the following discussion, five exemplary applications are presented for illustrating
    how digital twins support the operation of smart cities [49]. 4.2. Clarifying
    the terminology Despite its widespread use in everyday speech, science, government,
    and practice, smart technology is unlikely to be used as often in stormwater,
    hydrology, or hydraulics. The use of smart technology in a broader sense might
    pique the interest of decision-makers, legislators, and the public [50], but such
    expansive terminology can cause misunderstandings when discussing scientific advances.
    It is important to use consistent language so that the audience understands the
    nature, scope, and goal of the ideas being presented. To tie our discussion to
    the literature sources on which it is based [51], [52], [53], A variety of terminology
    is used to reflect similar yet noticeably different uses of smart technology.
    In this way, stormwater management will be improved along with related disciplines
    including green infrastructure, urban planning, and urban ecology. It refers to
    features and technologies that can be retrofitted to improve the capabilities
    of other devices, assets, or networks by enhancing their sensing, monitoring (data
    collection), communicating, managing, analyzing, integrating, controlling, or
    optimizing capabilities. Due to the inclusion of a variety of technologies with
    different degrees of “smartness” in this definition, current research uses smart
    technologies in a fragmented and uneven manner. In everyday conversations, as
    well as in science, governance, and practice, the term smart technology is pervasive.
    However, it is arguably more prevalent in fields like energy, telecommunications,
    and HVAC than in stormwater, hydrology, and hydraulics. Using smart technology
    as a general descriptor can attract the interest of decision-makers, policymakers,
    and the public [50], but such broad terms can cause confusion when discussing
    scientific progress and needs. Consistent terminology usage is crucial for effectively
    disseminating knowledge, and ensuring that audiences understand the nature, scope,
    and intent of the proposed approaches. In this review, various terms are used
    to describe similar yet subtly different applications of smart technology, attempting
    to connect our discussion to the literature sources upon which it is based [51],
    [52], [53]. To prevent confusion, we will define the terms used in the following
    section. Authors should clearly define the terms they use in an evolving field
    like this to foster clear communication within the stormwater discipline and promote
    dialogue with related disciplines such as system optimization and control, green
    infrastructure, urban planning, and urban ecology. Smart technology refers to
    technologies capable of sensing, monitoring (data collection), communicating,
    managing, analyzing, integrating, controlling, or optimizing devices in a systematic
    manner. These integrated smart features and technologies can be retrofitted to
    enhance the capabilities of other devices, assets, or networks. This definition
    covers a wide range of technologies with varying levels of smartness, leading
    to fragmented and inconsistent application of smart technologies in current research.
    The development of a framework is reviewed within this paper to accommodate this
    array of technologies and capabilities, allowing for benchmarking and comparison.
    Real-time control (RTC): In stormwater management, smart is an advancement from
    the established research field of RTC [54], [55], [56]. Parker et al. (2021) describes
    actuators, controllers, sensors, and telemetry in RTC systems [57]. Passive/active
    control: Passive control systems generally depend on hydraulic conditions to change
    the discharge rate from a specific asset, including orifices, vortex flow controls,
    and weirs. Passive systems may incorporate some degree of smartness if monitored
    (e.g., through telemetry reporting water levels) [58]. Typically, active control
    systems involve a device like an actuator which is driven by a local or global
    control system, and does not encompass assets controlling flow velocities using
    mechanical principles, such as vortex flow controls [59], [60], [61]. Internet
    of Things: The IoT refers to the interconnectivity of devices (both physical and
    virtual) to the Internet and other connected devices [62]. It encompasses both
    hardware and software in the context of smart stormwater. Artificial Intelligence:
    AI has enabled stormwater management improvements such as optimization, prediction,
    and forecasting. By evaluating vast datasets, spotting trends, and generating
    predictions using AI approaches, stormwater systems can be managed more effectively
    [63], [64], [65]. AI can be used to optimize adaptive control strategies, enabling
    stormwater infrastructure to respond effectively to changing environmental factors
    such as rainfall intensity and duration. The result is a reduction in flooding
    risk and better management of water quality [66]. Geographic Information Systems
    (GIS): Stormwater infrastructure geo- graphical data may be managed, analyzed,
    and visualized using GIS [67]. It assists with flood risk assessment, the design
    of stormwater systems, their upkeep, and the identification of sensitive locations
    [68]. Remote Sensing: Remote sensing technology, which utilizes satellite imaging
    and aerial photography makes it possible to monitor vast regions and gather useful
    information on land cover, precipitation, and urban growth [69]. Stormwater management
    decisions can be guided this information current stormwater systems can be evaluated
    on the basis of this data [70]. Green Infrastructure: Green infrastructure consists
    of natural or constructed systems that mimic natural processes to manage stormwater
    [71]. Permeable pavement, bioswales, rain gardens, and green roofs are some examples.
    Further- more, these methods help to reduce stormwater runoff, enhance water quality,
    and mitigate urban heat islands [72], [73]. Sensors and Telemetry: Stormwater
    infrastructure can be equipped with sensors and telemetry systems to measure water
    levels and flow rates in real-time. Proactive management of stormwater systems
    can be enabled by RTC systems [74]. Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA)
    Systems: SCADA systems centrally monitor and control stormwater infrastructure,
    allowing operators to effectively manage numerous assets, spot problems, and adapt
    to changing conditions [75], [76], [77]. Modeling and Simulation: The behavior
    of stormwater systems may be predicted using sophisticated hydrologic and hydraulic
    models, which can also be used to evaluate the operation of current infrastructure
    and provide information for the creation of new stormwater management strategies
    [78]. Cloud Computing and Big Data Analytics: Data related to stormwater management
    can now be processed and stored in huge quantities using cloud computing [79],
    [80]. By analyzing big data uncover trends and make better decisions [81]. 4.3.
    Optimization of SWM Due to the advancement of network-scale monitoring, several
    best-practice RTC methods are being created. These methods include fuzzy logic
    control, genetic algorithms, and neural networks. Making sure that water systems
    are used sustainably and independently is a key component of optimizing SWM [13],
    [81]. As a result, it is possible to minimize leaks and losses, guarantee the
    quality of the water, enhance customer happiness, and increase operational effectiveness.
    Understanding water systems better, detecting leaks earlier, controlling water
    loss more effectively, and continuously monitoring water quality, and achieving
    economic gains from water and energy conservation, financial loss reductions (of
    up to 30 % on water bills), improved system efficiency, and customer service quality,
    among other things are additional benefits of the sophisticated information technology
    used in SWM systems [82]. Flood control, combined sewer overflows, and network
    capacity are a few of the optimization techniques that emphasize water quantity
    management over water quality management. A major reason for this discrepancy
    is the maturity of the components required for monitoring quantity, which includes
    sensors, actuators, and telecommunications. Due to reliability and scalability
    issues, water quality measurement technology, in particular sensors, hasn''t yet
    reached the point where it can provide real-time feedback [83], [84], [85], [86].

    were both only partially successful in creating the best water distribution networks.

    was applied to three benchmark water distribution network optimization issues,
    and the outcomes were consistently good. Engineers can use the SOP-WDN to help
    with water distribution pipeline design and restoration. Xin et al. [92] 2022
    Mult objective Optimization Balancing water quality, energy, and cost factors

    As the problem of aging pipes worsens, NSGA-III should replace NSGA-II as the
    go-to technique for solving increasingly difficult WDS optimization issues, however,
    NSGA-II may still be used for easier optimization tasks. This constraint, in contrast
    to the virtually immediate nature of water level monitoring, results from the
    lag between gathering water quality samples and lab analysis. Proxy measurements
    including color, turbidity, and dissolved oxygen content have been used in recent
    years to develop this field, frequently in combination with real-time management
    of downstream treatment alternatives [87]. 4.4. The role of short-term forecasting
    in smart stormwater Data management at catchment scale has been improved by the
    integration of weather data and short-term forecasts into RTC [93], [94], [95].
    As a result, storm predictions and responses have become more accurate. A considerable
    period has passed since early flood warnings were developed for predicting future
    network states [96]. Meydani et al. [97] developed a real-time daily runoff forecast
    system by downscaling seasonal weather forecasts using Bayesian Belief Networks
    (BBN), particularly demonstrating BBN''s effectiveness in improving the accuracy
    of probabilistic precipitation forecasts. Zamani et al. [98] recently studied
    water quality forecasting. Various DL models were evaluated for chlorophyll-a
    concentrations, including recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memories
    (LSTMs), gated recurrent units (GRUs), and temporal convolutional networks (TCN).
    According to their results, the GRU model performed better, and the integration
    of these models into ensemble models using genetic algorithms improved forecasting
    accuracy. Particularly, the Mult objective optimization algorithm NSGA-II outperformed
    standalone DL and ensemble models based on GA. Having the ability to predict such
    events has reduced flood-related damage and improved emergency response. As computational
    models have become more powerful and cost-effective, coupled with high-resolution
    input data like weather radar, rainfall radar has been incorporated into the management
    of large sewer systems [99], [100], [101], [102]. Consequently, stormwater infrastructure
    has become more efficient and automated, enhancing urban communities'' resilience.

    modeling by using data from nearby sites as a means of transferring learning.

    coupled with computational advancements that integrate them with physics-based

    monitoring and forecasting. Zounemat-Kermani et al. [107] 2021 Surface water hydrology
    and hydraulics According to the findings of this study, ensemble strategies are
    clearly superior to single-model learning in hydrology. Additionally, boosting
    techniques (such as boosting, AdaBoost, and extreme gradient boosting) are more
    commonly employed to solve hydrological problems than bagging, stacking Antwi-Agyakwa
    et al. [108] 2023 Flood Risk Prediction In the present study, they found that
    ML models have been extensively employed to predict floods, while probabilistic
    models such as Copula and Bayesian Networks (B.N.) play a crucial role in evaluating
    the uncertainty associated with flood risks, which warrants further study due
    to their inherent uncertainty. In addition, the advancement of remote sensing,
    GIS, and cloud computing creates an ideal platform for integrating data and tools
    for flood forecasting. Rainwater harvesting systems can benefit from RTC technology
    in terms of water provision, flood protection, and environmental flow. Predicting
    rainfall before storm events allows this system to release water before storms
    occur, preventing uncontrolled overflows. A more efficient management of water
    resources can be achieved due to this approach, thereby reducing flood risks.
    Many advanced applications have relied on 24-hour forecasts, while long-term forecasts
    remain largely unexplored. It is possible that the exploration of these longer-term
    forecasts may result in further benefits and improvements to the performance of
    the system. RTC systems harvest less rainwater than passive systems, but they
    deliver environmental water for streamflow restoration and flood mitigation [99],
    [100]. It has been primarily the use of weather data for prediction rather than
    for actuating the operation of network features that have been the primary focus
    of the initial deployment. The accuracy and responsiveness of these systems can
    be further enhanced using auto-calibration feedback loops developed by some models
    using observed measurements within drainage catchments. Furthermore, several modeling
    studies have demonstrated that nowcasting approaches can be implemented to actuate
    and control detention ponds and drainage systems using rainfall radar [101]. As
    far as stormwater management is concerned, this is an important development. Recent
    reviews have demonstrated that nowcasting has significant potential, and a limited
    number of pilot studies have already been carried out on a commercial scale. Climate
    change also drives big changes in cities [109]. SWM and urban resilience will
    be impacted by this technology as it continues to evolve. 4.5. Decentralized smart
    stormwater systems The majority of literature on smart stormwater management systems
    incorporates RTC primarily into large infrastructure systems. These trends have
    led to centralized systems for water supply, treatment, and sewerage, sometimes
    called gray systems [110], [111]. In recent years, the emphasis has shifted from
    large assets to maximizing network capacity by utilizing multiple large assets
    across traditional sewer network components, including pipes, combined sewer overflows,
    and tanks. As such, RTC has been extensively demonstrated as a cost-effective
    method for increasing network capacity while maintaining options for future adaptation
    through retrofitting or updating control rules. There are some strategies for
    transforming existing urban areas into decentralized stormwater runoff management,
    but these are usually country- or city-specific [112], [113], [21]. The transition
    of urban areas towards decentralized management approaches, therefore, requires
    a systematic approach. Additionally, cities need assistance in assessing the practical
    potential for transforming their urban areas into decentralized solutions [114].
    A framework for smart water systems is shown in Fig. 3 [118]. Coordinated catchment-scale
    networks are believed to be the most effective way of using rainwater harvesting
    and attenuation basins. Offline optimization based on asset status, upstream conditions,
    or forecasting is currently the predominant method for coordinating assets. Despite
    equivalent volumes of distributed measures in individual tanks, distributed smart
    control systems offer some advantages [115], [116]. The decentralized control
    is becoming more widely accepted as a reliable solution because it requires minimal
    communication and has been shown to perform better in managing assets, such as
    capturing water during high- magnitude events, compared to passive operation alone.

    Fig. 3. A New Framework of Smart Water System [118]. This is commonly referred
    to as “sweating the assets.” However, most studies have only looked at the benefits
    at the individual asset level, ignoring the advantages of coordinated control
    across networks. Therefore, further research is needed to explore how these benefits
    can be optimized [117]. 4.6. Modeling AI in stormwater In many newly developed
    towns, stormwater retention ponds are a best manage- ment practice, but their
    widespread usage may be harmful to aquatic life. Many input parameters must be
    collected and calibrated for existing models, which are process-based. Researchers
    studied thermal modeling tool that incorporates readily available climatic data
    based on AI. AI-process-based models can often predict the temperature of shallow
    water bodies, such as small lakes and ponds [118], [119], [120], [121], [122],
    [123]. These types of models use climatological information and empirical equations
    to study convection, advection, and evaporation heat transport before utilizing
    numerical techniques to solve the heat equation. The quality of the input variables,
    some of which are hard to collect or prone to mistakes, has an impact on the accuracy
    of the model. As well as ANN models, evolutionary computing algorithms are influenced
    by Darwinian processes of natural selection and biological operations. In [125],
    genetic programming (GP) was introduced as the first advancement of the genetic
    algorithm. Random numbers (also called chromosomes) are used to form populations
    in the GP model. By comparing the fitness of each chromosome to a target value,
    fitness is evaluated. According to Darwin’s principle of survival of the fittest,
    computer programs are genetically reproduced through genetic crossover. GP models
    have been used to predict velocity in laboratory-scaled vegetated floodplains,
    develop rainfall-runoff relationships from synthetic data, assess salt intrusion
    in estuarine environments, simulate rainfall-runoff processes, and predict total
    organic carbon concentrations in lakes with flexible beds covered with vegetation.
    There is not a perfect link between hydrological parameters, climatic circumstances,
    and flow behavior in complex hydraulic systems like man-made wetlands. Hydrodynamic
    equations including the Manning''s roughness coefficient and the coefficient may
    be used to simulate the hydraulic behavior of these wetlands. Hydrodynamic models
    need a lot of data to be calibrated and validated in remote, biodiverse habitats
    like artificial wetlands. In comparison to hydrodynamic models, data- driven models
    may be better able to depict the nonlinear interactions between various hydraulic
    and hydrologic parameters connected to wetlands [118], [119], [120], [121], [122],
    [123], [124], [125]. Table 5 is a new attempt to contrast the usage of AI models
    in a wetland system since no other studies have thoroughly studied the use of
    data-driven models for forecasting hydrological parameters. In addition to using
    AI techniques, wetland hydraulic characteristics were compared with the conventional
    stepwise regression model as a baseline. Even though there have been numerous
    research efforts on neurocomputing models for predicting sediment concentration,
    as well as evaluations of their accuracy, some of these models are still not accurate
    or are computationally expensive. In [126] features a comparison of four multivariate
    non-linear regression models, including FFNN, ARIMA, and Multivariate Non-Linear
    Regression. FFNN often provided better forecasts, according to the researchers
    (Table 5). Table 5. Summary of the reviewed studies in modelling AI in stormwater.

    twin implementation experience In this paper, each city was chosen due to its
    unique contribution to the under- standing of digital twin technology in urban
    management. Helsinki’s leadership in digital twin innovation, Zurich’s focus on
    3-D spatial data and open govern- ment data policies, Vienna’s approach to 3-D
    city modeling, the University of Crete’s application of IoT for sustainability,
    the UK’s integration of digital twins in heritage conservation, Barcelona’s use
    of supercomputing for urban planning, and Imola’s emphasis on walkability and
    urban design all contribute to a rich collection of insights and experiences.
    These cities represent a cross-section of geographical locations, urban challenges,
    and technological advances, making them ideal case studies for exploring the diverse
    applications and impacts of digital twin technology in enhancing stormwater infrastructure
    systems and contributing to the development of smart, sustainable, and resilient
    cities. In addition to their individual achievements and challenges, their selection
    is based on the breadth of knowledge and experience they bring to the study of
    digital twins in urban infrastructure management. 5.1. Digital twin in Helsinki
    The city of Helsinki, Finland is leading the way, spearheaded by Jarmo Suomisto,
    with its digital twin, which consists of both a Reality model and a semantic city
    GML model. As a benchmark for urban modeling, the city’s approach to digital twinning
    includes both visual and semantic data. Helsinki’s inclusion in this study is
    justified by its pioneering status in applying digital twin technology to urban
    planning and sustainability goals, particularly its ambitious carbon neutrality
    goals. Through the use of advanced software and open-data models, as well as its
    efforts to engage the public through digital twins on mobile devices, the city
    offers valuable lessons regarding the use of digital twins for improved urban
    simulation, public engagement, and data management. A reality model consists of
    two billion polygons and depicts the visual representation of the city, whereas
    a semantic model consists of layers of data that can be labeled, queried, modified,
    and expanded (see Fig. 4). Download : Download high-res image (524KB) Download

    data infrastructure. • A digital twin on mobile devices can be used to communicate
    project information and gather crowd-sourced input, increasing public engagement.
    • A federated source of truth that serves as an archive and hub for the city data,
    information, and spatial views and allows immersive VR headset exploration. 5.2.
    Digital twin in Zurich Another facet of digital twin applications is Zurich’s
    digital twin, which incorporates 3D spatial data, theme elements, and public participation.
    Its alignment with the Infrastructure for Spatial Information in the European
    Community“ (INSPIRE) Directive, despite not being a member of the EU, and its
    proactive Open Government Data policies since 2012 illustrate how digital twins
    can facilitate data accessibility and interoperability. As a result of its innovative
    use of digital twin technology in evaluating architectural designs and its commitment
    to improving spatial data visualization’s visual and performative quality, Zurich
    illustrates the transformative potential of digital twins for urban planning and
    management. A focus on 3D spatial data is at the heart of Zurich’s digital twin,
    which incorporates various thematic elements. It serves as a reference point for
    connecting spatial and other types of data. Cadastral and engineering surveying
    processes are adjusted to accommodate the third dimension during digitization
    and further processing of space. Blindflug Studios incorporated a 3D architectural
    component of the City of Zurich’s digital twin in a dystopian cyberpunk recreation
    of Zurich that is focused on its Reformation. The objective is to pique the curiosity
    of those who are not generally drawn to the topic. A digital twin is shown in
    Fig. 5 in Zurich [130]. Download : Download high-res image (353KB) Download :
    Download full-size image Fig. 5. Digital twin in Zurich [130]. The Federal Act
    on Geoinformation provides descriptions of spatial data, spatial data models,
    and spatial metadata, exceeding the INSPIRE Directive even though Switzerland
    is not an EU member state. Unlike other European countries, Switzerland already
    had a formal Spatial Data Infrastructure and a robust governance framework before
    implementing INSPIRE. In a digital city’s infrastructure, Open Government Data
    (OGD) refers to administrative data that does not require specific protection.
    Since 2012, data from the city''s public administration has been freely accessible,
    machine-readable, and available under an open license. OGD policies and guidelines
    have also been issued and implemented. The Office for Building Construction is
    utilizing digital technologies as part of a pilot project to facilitate the examination
    of submitted designs throughout the judging process. Through a web-based 3D map,
    the first tool enables users to review and submit 3D models of competition submissions
    (Fig. 6). The 3D map is projected onto a screen during the judgment process so
    that the jury may inspect the models, adjust viewpoints and sizes, compare designs
    simultaneously, and view spatial data like construction lines (Baulinien). Fig.
    6 illustrates how 3D spatial data are becoming more prevalent as a spatial solution.
    There are more than a dozen cities worldwide that use Zurich''s virtual city model
    in areas such as environmental studies (noise modeling, air pollution modeling,
    mobile phone radiation modeling), energy (solar potential modeling), and urban
    planning (shade analysis, visibility modeling), to name just a few. Download :

    spatial data in Zurich [130]. To explain the creation and tracking of spatial
    data, models, and metadata, 3D spatial data is used as a reference point for merging
    geographical and other types of data. Digital places can be created and maintained
    through metadata and lifecycle management. Real-time updates can be performed
    on the digital twin for some applications using sensors. Consequently, the third
    dimension is consistently captured and stored during the digitization of real
    space. The visualization of spatial data should be attractive and performant in
    order to enhance understanding and support for the digital twin. In order to encourage
    the dissemination of spatial data and the development of new applications, Open
    Government Data must be made available. There is a need for an automated mechanism
    for gaining access to and ordering data, as well as a simple and attractive method
    for searching and analyzing that data. 5.3. Digital twin in Vienna A method for
    generating 3D city models and other geodata products was proposed by Lehner &
    Dorffner [131]. In order to create a virtual 3D replica of the city’s elements,
    they used existing 3D surveying and mapping data to create a digital geoTwin.
    Besides developing photogrammetric roof models, they developed detailed building
    models based on construction plans and facade images. In order to create photorealistic
    models of buildings, generic textures were used. Furthermore, they developed models
    for two specific areas of landscape, vegetation, and city furniture. The 3D objects
    in these areas were not associated with any semantic information, however. The
    Digital geoTwin of Vienna is designed to develop a topological and semantic 3D
    model of the city based on raw measurements and other input sources. It is possible
    to create City Information Models (CIMs) by combining the Digital geoTwin with
    other datasets, such as census, socioeconomic, energy consumption, and maintenance
    management data. To capture smooth terrain forms and fill in missing information
    from terrestrial and photogrammetric surveys, both discrete surveying data and
    Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) data are employed during the modeling process. For
    the Digital geoTwin, LOD2.4 F0 is selected as the preferred level of detail in
    order to address inconsistencies in footprints and to meet the requirements for
    generating lower levels of detail (LODs). An illustration of Schwedenplatz in
    3D is shown in Fig. 7. Following is a summary of the process for measuring various
    building features for the Digital geoTwin: • Rooftop: Stereo-photogrammetry is
    used to measure rooftops. The LOD2.4 takes into account roof overhangs, which
    require roof edge measurements, and captures the general roof shape and large
    superstructures. • Overbuilt structures: Using terrestrial, mobile mapping data,
    or Terrestrial Laser Scanning (TLS), overbuilt structures must be mea- sured from
    ground level if air space extends into the structure. On top portions of buildings
    with protruding parts, stereo-photogrammetry can be used, while on the bottom
    portions, terrestrial methods can be used. • Footprint: In addition to terrestrial
    surveying, other methods are needed for building faces adjacent to public spaces.
    Data from mobile mapping can be used for facades facing streets but not adjacent
    public areas. ALS, oblique imagery, or stereo-photogrammetry can be used for facades
    that are not adjacent to public spaces and are orientated away from street areas.
    As a last resort, a fixed distance (Fd) can be employed if none of these datasets
    are available. Download : Download high-res image (460KB) Download : Download

    sustainability at the University of Crete The Technical University of Crete in
    Greece has integrated an IoT sensor system to improve its current building energy
    management system (BEMS). Between 2015 and 2020, OpenLink sensors were installed
    in three stages. On the TUC campus, more than 6,000 sensors have been put in more
    than 300 rooms spread over 16 student residential halls. The sensors are managed
    via a web interface that continually tracks energy use, takes into account room
    occupancy, and collects data for system application analysis. The ultimate goal
    is to increase campus sustainability by lowering operating expenses by identifying
    utilization inefficiencies and spotting irregularities in energy use (Fig. 8).

    [132]. Mavrokapnidis et al. [132] used the TUC building management system as a
    use case in their research, proposing a methodology for fusing static and dynamic
    building data from various sources. They tested this methodology using data from
    the OpenLink sensors. The high-level system architecture of the TUC building management
    system is depicted in Fig. 8. OpenLink sensors from different rooms wirelessly
    transmit data to their respective Remote Terminal Units (RTUs), which then forward
    the data to the system middleware via Modbus TCP/IP. The data is processed by
    the middleware and is kept in a database. A web-based server that centrally manages
    the building management system interprets the data using digital twins of campus
    structures. By merging data from the digital twin and the physical twin sensors,
    the front-end application creates graphical output, including building topology,
    electrical equipment, energy meters, and HVAC. Advanced analytics and calculations
    for optimum control may be done using this information (Fig. 9). Download : Download

    of the hardware and software infrastructure that supports these sensing devices.
    5.5. Digital twin in clifton suspension Bridge, UK This digital twin provides
    a shared and open ecosystem of data and information from various collaborators
    and stakeholders to connect the real and digital worlds. Public and private organizations,
    both large and small, can benefit from its scale and delivery of meaningful output
    and services. Due to the municipal interest and complementary activities around
    regeneration in the area, East Birmingham and TEED were selected to provide a
    better understanding of previous influencing projects, initiatives, and strategic
    plans. An illustration of Birmingham''s ecosystem of activities is shown in Fig.
    10. The snapshot captures a variety of local activities, and taking these activities
    into account will increase the value and relevance of the creation of a tangible
    digital twin. Each of the initiatives listed has been examined to determine its
    general focus and potential connections to the digital twin. Fig. 10 displays

    revolution was launched by Barcelona Supercomputing Centre (BSC), an entity that
    houses the MareNostrum supercomputer in a 19th-century chapel in Barcelona. This
    computing power allows urban planners to anticipate impacts and mitigate negative
    consequences by making decisions based on real data. A digital twin of the city
    has been created by BSC, allowing testing and validation of potential city planning
    scenarios before implementation. Over the next five years, the scheme will become
    a fundamental tool for urban planning, despite being still in its test phase.
    Across European cities, this technology-driven approach is expected to become
    standard practice in urban planning to benefit all citizens. Challenge. Air quality
    and emissions issues have been inadvertently pushed to other areas by previous
    traffic and pollution management measures, necessitating additional measures.
    There are a number of key challenges to be addressed, including: • Improving a
    community''s access to facilities and services. • Dealing with urban renewal and
    gentrification. • Putting into action major climate change initiatives between
    2030 and 2050. Approach. • Planning decisions, such as clean air measures, should
    be simulated prior to implementation, to identify and mitigate negative impacts,
    or to plan additional measures in advance. • Monitoring gentrification trends
    based on indicative measures, such as homestays. • Public transportation and services
    are underserved areas. • The use of open-access technologies, including OpenstreetMap,
    to encourage citizen participation; allowing them to challenge and contribute
    to planning processes. Impact. • To restructure cities so that people may live,
    work, and access all the services they require (such as shopping, health care,
    and education) within a 15-minute walk or bike ride. • Decision-making based on
    evidence, data, and citizen accountability. 5.7. Digital twin in Imola Italy Recently,
    urban design has made walkability a key consideration. The idea stresses the use
    of local transit, bicycles, or foot for the bulk of everyday requirements. Urban
    morphology, which encompasses the design of buildings, public areas, and roadway
    layouts, has an impact on walkability. In terms of urban morphology, connection
    and accessibility are crucial for walkability. A location is more likely to be
    frequented by pedestrians if it is geographically linked to other destinations.
    Contrarily, connectivity describes the availability and directness of paths connecting
    two sites. Using Rhino 6, the neighborhood''s urban land use is imported to ensure
    accessibility and connectivity. Public green nodes, public transit nodes, and
    public urban space nodes are thought of as destinations as pedestrian paths originating
    from residential parcels. Within a small local region, the likelihood of walking
    far enough to fulfill health recommendations is frequently assessed. Every distance
    level between the starting nodes and the destinations, ranging from 0 to 3 km,
    is given a distinct score according to this model. The map will then be overlaid
    with the PET map to create a green pedestrian network. Imola, a historically big
    city in Italy with a humid subtropical climate, is the subject of the case study.
    The city, which has a population of 70,000, has a total area of 204 km2. The city,
    which is part of the Bologna metropolitan area, has frigid winters and sweltering
    summers. The neighborhood in Imola that was chosen is in the city''s historic
    district and is distinguished by its low-rise structures and scant street tree
    canopy coverage (Fig. 11). Download : Download high-res image (689KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 11. The 3-dimensional model of the city includes
    connection routes, buildings, and urban vegetation [134]. The implementation of
    a digital twin in Imola, Italy, aims to enhance urban planning and address walkability
    challenges within the historical contextual 3D replica of Imola''s urban elements
    and objects, enabling city planners and stakeholders to visualize, analyze, and
    optimize various urban planning scenarios. By incorporating multiple data sources
    such as cadastral data, aerial imagery, LiDAR, and socio-economic information,
    the digital twin offers a dynamic representation of the city''s existing conditions.
    As a result of its low tree canopy cover and low-rise building structures, Imola''s
    digital twin focuses on its historical core. This problem is addressed by incorporating
    data on public green nodes, public transportation nodes, and public urban spaces
    into the digital twin. Imola''s city planners can identify potential improvements
    to the pedestrian network by analyzing the connectivity and accessibility of these
    nodes, leading to an increase in walkability and a greater quality of life for
    the city''s residents. Additionally, planners can use the digital twin to evaluate
    the impact of various urban interventions, such as adding green spaces, expanding
    public transportation, or redesigning streets to prioritize pedestrians and cyclists.
    In order to create a more sustainable and livable city, stakeholders can simulate
    these interventions in a digital environment to better understand their potential
    outcomes and make more informed decisions. As shown in Fig. 11, a three-dimensional
    model of the city has been developed, which includes connections, buildings, and
    urban vegetation [134]. The thermal comfort digital twin model presented in this
    study aims to effectively mirror the physical world through a three-step process:
    data collection, learning process and analysis, and post-implementation processes
    and decision-making. This innovative approach allows for an understanding of urban
    microclimates, walkability, and green pedestrian networks, ultimately supporting
    urban planners in making informed decisions. Data collection involves gathering
    a variety of data sources, such as meteorological data, GIS data, remote sensing
    imagery, and socio-economic information. These datasets are crucial for constructing
    a detailed and accurate digital twin that reflects the physical environment and
    its microclimatic conditions. After collecting the necessary data, ML algorithms
    and other analyt- ical tools are employed to process and analyze the information,
    allowing the model to learn patterns and relationships between various factors,
    such as urban morphology, vegetation, and thermal comfort. The outcome is an understanding
    of the factors influencing walkability and green pedestrian net- works within
    the urban context. confirming the digital twin and utilizing it to assist in decision-making
    for urban planning and design is the model''s last stage. The digital twin may
    be improved to incorporate a wide range of data sources and simulations on many
    dimensions and themes by fusing offline microclimate models with real-time data
    sources. 6. Green infrastructure inventory In order to create an inventory of
    local green infrastructure components in the research region, the first step in
    was to identify botanical species and their locations (Fig. 12). The location
    of the urban green infrastructure samples was established in the field using a
    GPS device. The measured points were saved as a KML file for Google Earth. In
    addition to registering the species of each specimen, a unique identification
    number for each item of urban infrastructure was documented in an interoperable
    table using the KML format. The following phase entailed employing engineering
    and mapping techniques to determine the geometric dimensions of the specimens
    under study. By measuring the area (in square meters) of the crown projection
    over the orthophoto image with ArcMap GIS software, the surface area of each tree
    crown was documented (Fig. 12). Using Autodesk Recap software, the dimensions
    of each specimen from the LiDAR point cloud were measured in order to determine
    the specimens'' height (Fig. 12). A list that was obtained had dimensions that
    were quite similar to those of genuine specimens. This 3-dimensional Green Pedestrian
    Network (GPN) digital twin’s first section aims to estimate the Physiological
    Equivalent Temperature (PET). Based on Python 3.8.1 code, a hybrid model is developed
    which simulates each parameter in its own engine. The interrelationships of the
    parameters are programmed as an Python script in order to guarantee accuracy of
    input and output ordering in each phase, as well as the outcome of the model in
    the final step. There are three engines used in the model: EnergyPlus, Grasshopper,
    and OpenFOAM. Imola''s historic center is shown in Fig. 12 [134]. Download : Download

    1) Calculation of the body''s thermal state for a specific set of meteorological
    variables using the Munich Energy-Balance Model for Individuals (MEMI); 2) Entering
    the computed mean skin and core temperatures into the MEMI model and solving the
    energy balance equation system for air temperature with specific parameters (v
    = 0.1 m/s, vapor pressure (VP) = 12 hPa, and mean radiant temperature (Tmrt) =
    Ta) (Table 6). Table 6. Thermal perception ranges of physiological equivalent
    temperatures (PET). PET Thermal Perception Grade of Psychological Stress ≤18 °C
    Very cold High 18 °C − 23 °C Cold Moderate 23 °C − 26 °C Slightly cool Slight
    26 °C − 29 °C Comfortable None 29 °C − 32 °C Slightly warm Slight 32 °C − 38 °C
    Hot Moderate ≥38 °C Very hot High In Table 6, the ranges of the Physiological
    Equivalent Temperature (PET) for different grades of thermal perception by human
    beings and physiological stress on human beings can be classified as follows (with
    internal heat production at 80W and heat transfer resistance of clothing at 0.9
    [135]. Using the MEMI model. As a result of this method, the digital twin can
    accurately calculate the PET values across the urban environment, which will help
    to inform decisions related to improving walkability and establishing green pedestrian
    networks in urban planning and design. 7. Digital twin modeling and real-time
    visualization A real-time link between the virtual digital twin and the real world
    was suggested by Wang et al. [136]. IoT sensors capture data, which is recorded
    in real-time in a database. By evaluating, modeling, and making decisions based
    on real-time data, users may build a virtual representation of the actual world.
    Gao et al. [137] introduced the idea of a digital twin production line based on
    simulation and modeling of the production line and digital twin. The production
    process for the digital twin is then in real-time modeled and simulated. The usefulness
    of the suggested approach is illustrated with an illustration of a product assembly
    line. As part of NASA''s design, operation, and monitoring of airplanes, grieves
    initially put out digital twins in 2011. Scholars have created a large number
    of 3D models of Digital Twin technology. Digital twins were used by Sepasgozar
    et al., [138] to assess the feasibility of combining virtual and actual energy
    in industrial systems. A 3D representation of the digital twin utilizing the EnergyPlus,
    Honeybee, and Ladybug components from the grasshopper framework was recommended
    by Gholami et al. [134] for the Rhinoceros platform. Based on in situ datasets
    that demonstrate its dependability, a digital twin for the GPN is verified. Additionally,
    by giving urban planners and policymakers a precise and helpful approach for modeling
    pedestrian-level urban greenery impacts on human thermal comfort, it assures the
    effectiveness of policies in various urban contexts. Stakeholders can concentrate
    on their individual duties with the aid of the digital twin building system developed
    by Choi et al. [139]. The instances in this essay also concern Korean suppliers
    of car components. The system is simple to use for both major organizations and
    small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs). The digital twin may be utilized to
    easily manage the production site in addition to watching CCTV. According to Yang
    et al.''s [140] description, true 3D was achieved by transferring structural and
    semantic geographical elements that facilitate human- machine compatibility and
    real-time perception of the IoT on 3D geographical sceneries. Digital elevation
    models, digital surface models, digital orthophotos, actual orthophotos, oblique
    3D models, and laser point clouds are a few examples of digital representations
    of geographic scenes. The use of scanners to gather data presents a number of
    novel opportunities and difficulties, according to Perc and Topolek [141]. This
    analysis examines the digital development of smart green buildings to generate
    continuous ecological development regions in green ecological cities. The major
    points of Intelligent Green Buildings (IGB) are described in this part, along
    with the use and function of digital twins in intelligent buildings. 8. Discussion
    and potential limitations of digital twins Digital twin modeling and real-time
    visualization as a powerful tool for modeling and simulating physical systems
    in real time, digital twins have gained attention in recent years. Through virtual
    representations of physical systems, data can be analyzed and manipulated in real-time,
    enabling more informed decisions and efficient management. There are, however,
    several limitations and challenges associated with digital twins that need to
    be considered, despite their potential benefits. The accuracy of digital twins
    is one of their potential limitations. A digital twin can only be as accurate
    as the data it is based on, so any errors or inaccuracies in the data will affect
    its accuracy. Any faults or malfunctions in the sensors or technologies used to
    collect data can also affect the accuracy of digital twins. Below is a summary
    of each application’s limitations: 1. Data-driven vs. data science: In order to
    accurately represent complex systems being modeled, data science rather than a
    data- driven approach is needed. 2. Complexity of digital twins: Creating an exact
    digital twin of complex systems, such as life on Earth, weather, climate, and
    human health may be more challenging than creating a simple, static digital twin.
    3. ML limitations: Modern ML models have impressive numbers of parameters, but
    they can''t capture all the interactions and effects, leading to inaccurate predictions.
    4. AI concerns: There is no universal AI, and AI systems are black boxes, which
    raises concerns about their potential harm and the need for meaningful human control.
    5. Optimization challenges: Due to the lack of science to determine the right
    goal function, the concept of optimizing the world is problematic. 6. Data-driven
    society limitations: Intangible qualities are important to human life, but data-driven
    societies may struggle to achieve them. 7. Disruptive innovations: Digital twins
    can make pessimistic predictions that do not take into account disruptive innovations.
    8. Humans vs. things: In a highly networked and complex world, managing people
    like things that pose ethical challenges. 9. Dual-use concerns: In order to prevent
    dual-use and improve transparency and accountability, digital twins, due to their
    powerful nature can cause large-scale damage. 10. Alternative uses of technology:
    The socio-ecological finance system promotes sustainable circular and sharing
    economies as an alternative to traditional technology-driven approaches. 11. Need
    for social innovation: The digital age can be fully tapped by promoting a multi-stakeholder
    approach to participatory resilience through social innovation. Therefore, Complexity
    is an opportunity for new solutions and digital assistance can support flexible
    adaptation and co-evolution, but it is important to recognize that societies are
    not machines, and a narrow optimization approach is not sufficient to manage them.
    9. Conclusion By building on the insights and contributions presented throughout
    the paper, our conclusion underscores the potential transformative impact of combining
    AI with digital twin models in the development of stormwater infrastructure systems
    within smart cities. Besides enabling more efficient resource management, this
    integration contributes to urban resilience and sustainability. Increasingly,
    AI technology is playing an increasingly pivotal role in augmenting digital twin
    models, providing sophisticated solutions to the multifaceted challenges of urban
    stormwater management. The present study reveals the current state and capabilities
    of digital twin technology in urban water systems management based on an review
    of existing literature and enriched by diverse case studies from cities such as
    Helsinki, Zurich, and Vienna. This paper lays a solid foundation for understanding
    how digital twins can be optimized through AI by clarifying terminology, practices,
    and fundamental technologies. The exploration of digital twins in managing smart
    water systems, from short-term forecasting to the enhancement of decentralized
    systems, underscores the critical role AI plays in revolutionizing stormwater
    management within smart urban environments. In addition to demonstrating practical
    applications of digital twins in urban water management, the case studies also
    highlight key research areas where AI can further revolutionize these processes.
    In this study, we examine digital twins’ contributions to green infrastructure
    planning and the pivotal role of real- time data visualization in the creation
    of more sustainable and resilient urban landscapes using AI-enhanced digital twins.
    The purpose of this paper is not only to examine the status of digital twin technology
    and its integration with AI, but also to project its trajectory in the future.
    In spite of the study’s limitations, it identifies crucial implications for future
    research on AI-enhanced digital twin models, particularly in relation to the stormwater
    infrastructure of smart cities. With the development of digital twin technology,
    combined with advances in AI, complex urban challenges can be addressed more effectively.
    We must continue to explore and refine the integration of AI into digital twin
    models in the future to ensure that these technologies can fully realize their
    potential in contributing to smarter, more sustainable urban environments. In
    this endeavor, we can anticipate not only the enhancement of stormwater management
    systems, but also the improvement of urban living conditions in general, a step
    towards the realization of truly smart cities. CRediT authorship contribution

  data_sources: Hydraulic model of the Funchal water distribution network developed
    using EPANET software, simulation data from HOMER software, case study data from
    Funchal, Portugal
  description: The world’s water infrastructures suffer from inefficiencies, such
    as high energy consumption and water losses due to inadequate management practices
    and feeble pressure regulation, leading to frequent water and energy losses. This
    strains vital water and energy resources, especially in the face of the worsening
    challenges of climate change and population growth. A novel method is presented
    that integrates micro-hydropower plants, with pumps as turbines (PATs), in the
    water network in the city of Funchal. Sensitivity analyses evaluated the microgrid’s
    response to variations in the cost of energy components, showing favorable outcomes
    with positive net present value (NPV). PV solar and micro-wind turbines installed
    exclusively at the selected PRV sites within the Funchal hydro grid generate a
    combined 153 and 55 MWh/year, respectively, supplementing the 406 MWh/year generated
    by PATs. It should be noted that PATs consistently have the lowest cost of electricity
    (LCOE), confirming their economic viability and efficiency across different scenarios,
    even after accounting for reductions in alternative energy sources and grid infrastructure
    costs.

    1. Introduction By managing natural resources, society exerts significant pressure
    on the natural environment [1]. There is a threat of systemic collapse. As a result,
    many industrialized nations have begun implementing green energy strategies, reaching
    over 10% of total energy production [2]. The projection of energy consumption,
    especially in regions under significant urbanization pressure and associated carbon
    dioxide emissions, poses a formidable challenge to society [3]. The acceleration
    of economic development and rising standards of living have made energy security
    a top priority for policy makers worldwide [4]. This predicament requires a city
    to take innovative approaches to resource management to improve the quality of
    life for its residents. Achieving these goals is consistent with the imperative
    to minimize resource use, leading to increased sustainability efforts [5]. Water
    research has provided clear evidence on the global dimension of the water challenge
    and the role of humans as a chief force shaping the global water cycle [6,7].
    Water infrastructures, in particular, are characterized by high energy consumption,
    ranging from 0.2 to 4.08 kWh/m3 [8]. This energy is mainly obtained from pumping
    stations. It includes the energy required to perform various processes and distribution
    activities. Renewable resources such as solar, wind, and hydropower offer viable
    alternatives for providing this energy and reducing dependence on non-renewable
    sources [9]. Using renewable energy systems involves integrating hybrid pumped
    storage, photovoltaic, and wind turbine systems in conjunction with battery storage
    [10]. The synergistic use of these technologies enables water utilities to operate
    their water systems independently of the conventional grid infrastructure [11],
    in which the pumped hydro-storage is a real infrastructure to manage the renewable
    production [12]. Numerous research studies have used heuristic methods to develop
    flexible solutions for hybrid system optimization [13]. Parameters such as temperature,
    wind speed, and solar radiation significantly impact the optimization of these
    hybrid systems, as found by [14]. Moreover, a comprehensive review of different
    techniques for hybrid system optimization has been given in [15]. For this purpose,
    various algorithms have been used, including genetic algorithms for solar and
    wind systems in Hong Kong [16], particle swarm optimization for power generation
    in Rafsanjan (Iran) ranging from 42 to 80 kW [17], and an imperialistic competition
    algorithm for a 1450 kW hybrid system in Pulau Perhentian (Malaysia) [18]. Harmony
    search methods were used by [19] to optimize the components of the hybrid system
    with a power of 1 kW. Researchers [20] formulated an approach for optimal sizing
    of distributed power generation by photovoltaic and diesel generator systems using
    energy management and size optimization through a new approach for an islanding
    solution. The gray wolf optimization method was used to determine the optimal
    number of PV panels, wind turbines, and battery banks while considering the minimum
    annual cost [21]. Another optimization of hybrid systems focusing on minimizing
    electricity costs was performed using the firefly-inspired algorithm [22]. In
    contrast, harmony search methods were used to minimize life cycle costs in a hybrid
    system in Ardabil (Iran) [23]. Evolutionary algorithms and artificial bee swarm
    optimization were also used to optimize various hybrid systems, such as the 7
    kW system in Rafsanjan [24] and the 5 kW system [25]. On the other hand, examples
    of hybrid system sizing using the big bang–big crunch method were presented in
    [26], with an optimized power target of 3715 kW. In [27], using HOMER software,
    a performance analysis of off-grid hybrid power systems in remote areas was carried
    out, minimizing the net present cost and CO2 emissions. In addition, HOMER was
    used to optimize hydro systems with hydropower and photovoltaic plants in Lisbon
    (Portugal) [28]. The authors of [29] developed an optimized methodology using
    simulated annealing for hybrid systems involving photovoltaic and micro-hydropower
    systems with pumps as turbines (PATs), achieving an annual reduction of 2838 tons
    of CO2 emissions and 553 MWh of energy generated from non-renewable sources in
    Spanish irrigation systems. The feasibility of similar systems in remote cities,
    such as the Bahamas, was investigated in a case study by [30]. Integrating these
    technologies into water management is essential to improve the water–energy nexus.
    This aligns with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and enables adaptation
    to the challenges of climate change while reducing greenhouse gas emissions [31].
    Numerous studies highlight how implementing operational strategies can significantly
    improve the sustainability of water distribution networks while optimizing energy
    management [31]. Following the references above, energy communities can use associations,
    cooperatives, partnerships, nonprofit organizations, or small/medium businesses
    to facilitate citizen participation and joint investment in energy assets [32].
    This collaborative approach contributes to a decarbonized and more flexible energy
    system, as energy communities can act as a unified entity that can access renewable
    energy markets in different combinations and at a smaller scale [33]. By upgrading
    the water sector, an essential service for the population, energy communities
    can contribute to grid flexibility through adaptive demand reduction mechanisms
    [34]. In summary, energy communities offer an opportunity to reshape how society
    perceives and integrates essential variables such as water and energy satisfaction.
    By harnessing available renewable energy sources, citizens can actively participate
    in the energy transition, resulting in significant benefits for all. Pressure-reducing
    valves (PRVs) are used in water distribution networks to ensure standardization
    and regulation of pressure, dividing the water network into pressure zones according
    to topographical conditions. The operation of PRVs results in a localized loss
    of pressure and, thus, a loss of hydraulic energy due to a lower outlet pressure.
    PRVs generate controlled pressure and flow zones where an efficient management
    of water losses becomes possible, allowing for faster detection and response [35,36,37].
    Pumps as turbines (PATs) provide an alternative means of pressure control in water
    distribution networks (WDNs) and increase system efficiency and flexibility. However,
    the main disadvantage of PATs is the lack of flow device control, which leads
    to suboptimal efficiency when flow rates fluctuate. For WDNs, flow and head pattern
    fluctuations can reduce overall energy production due to low efficiency at partial
    load and the inability to provide the required head for suitable operational conditions.
    In general, manufacturers do not provide the characteristics of PATs, which is
    one of the biggest challenges for their application. Under stable operating conditions,
    pressure-reducing valves (PRVs) and PATs exhibit similar behavior. Therefore,
    PATs are a viable alternative for generating sustainable energy at low cost. Despite
    the drawbacks and challenges of implementing PATs, they offer a compelling alternative
    for harnessing hydropower and improving system efficiency. This results in reduced
    dependence on other energy sources and induces lower operating costs. Integrating
    PATs into WDNs can improve water, energy, and cost management in intelligent water
    grids and is an important step toward developing future smart cities [38,39,40,41,42,43,44].
    The addition of strategies to improve the sustainability of water systems is crucial
    to reach the zero-emission balance [45,46,47]. Hence, this research proposes a
    new strategy that includes different optimized methods, both hydraulic and energetic,
    that allow for improving the management of water distribution systems to analyze
    the possibility of combining different renewable systems to meet energy needs
    in small energy communities [48,49]. The development of this research enables
    the establishment of a green management proposal, which allows water managers
    the development of new strategies to improve sustainability in the water sector
    [50]. 2. Materials and Methods The methodology used in this study includes the
    use of water networks that supply water to local communities, focusing on identifying
    possible optimal locations for pressure-reducing valves (PRVs), controlling the
    pressure in the network, for the recovery of water energy (e.g., pumps as turbines—PATs)
    to generate hydropower. Next, (i) hydraulic simulation (ii) can be used to identify
    the implementation of PATs and (iii) the energy simulation with complementarity
    between other renewable sources to generate an optimal hybrid small energy solution
    that (iv) allows for the analysis of microgrids in an economical way through the
    best combination of renewable systems (Figure 1). Figure 1. Flow chart of the
    proposed integrated methodology. 2.1. Hydraulic Model Simulator The hydraulic
    simulation methods used in the analysis of water distribution networks rely on
    the EPANET model (or equivalent) developed by the U.S. Environmental Protection
    Agency (EPA) (Figure 2). This model allows for both static simulations and simulations
    over time so that hydraulic behavior and flow and pressure distribution throughout
    the network can be evaluated. Figure 2. Hydraulic simulator methodology. The EPANET
    simulator (2.2) is widely known and considered one of the most widely used software
    applications for water system simulation. EPANET uses the “gradient method” to
    derive equations governing the principles of continuity, energy conservation,
    and the relationship between flow and pressure drop, all of which characterize
    hydraulic equilibrium within a piping system. The continuity of flow at a node
    is governed by Equation (1), while Equation (2) establishes the relationship between
    flow and pressure drop in a pipeline segment from node i to j. Equation (3) specifies
    the demand for each branch of the pipeline network. ∑ 𝑗 𝑎𝑖𝑗  𝑄 𝑖𝑗 + 𝐷 𝑖 =0 𝑓𝑜𝑟
    𝑖=1,…𝑁 (1) 𝐻 𝑖 − 𝐻 𝑘 = ℎ 𝑖𝑘 =𝑟 𝑄 𝑛−1 𝑖𝑗 (2) 𝐿 𝑓 =𝑘· 𝐿 𝑖 ·𝑁 (3) where 𝐷 𝑖 is the
    demand in each node (by convention, the flow that arrives at the node is positive)
    (L/s) , 𝐻 𝑖 is the nodal head (m) , ℎ is the head loss (m) , 𝑟 is the resistance
    coefficient, 𝑄 is the flow rate (L/s) , 𝑛 is the flow estimation orifice leak
    exponent, Lf is the fictitious pipe length, L is the real pipe length, and N is
    the number of building floors. The coefficient k depends on the line service,
    whether on both sides, at just one side, or with no service. Thereby, knowing
    the head of the fixed nodes, it is possible to obtain the heads,  𝐻 𝑖 , and flows,  𝑄
    𝑖𝑗 , of the network that satisfies Equations (1)–(3). The water resource calculation
    involves multiplying the peak flow observed at each valve by the corresponding
    hourly demand curve. 2.2. Energy Recovery with PATs Implementing pump-as-turbine
    (PAT) systems in energy recovery involves identifying key parameters, such as
    flow rate and available head, to estimate power output. In addition, pressure-reducing
    valves (PRVs) are critical in maintaining pressure control within the network.
    Installation of PAT systems is defined in terms of various modes of operation,
    including no control (NR); hydraulic control (HR), which includes additional valves
    in the main line and PAT bypass; energy control (ER), which is achieved by variable
    operating speed (VOS) of the PAT impeller; or a combination of both (HER) (as
    shown in Figure 3, Figure 4 and Figure 5). Figure 3. PAT implementation methodology.
    Figure 4. Scheme of a PAT in a pipe system (a), with hydraulic and/or electrical
    regulation (HR, ER, HER) (b). Figure 5. Scheme for single–serial–parallel (SSP)
    PAT mode (a), characteristic curves for SSP modes (b). Once the locations for
    the pressure-reducing valves (PRVs) are identified, a characteristic curve of
    the installation (CCI) is generated based on the measured inlet and outlet pressures
    at the PRV nodes. This CCI illustrates the relationship between flow rate and
    available head within the hydraulic system. An appropriate characteristic curve
    for a pump as turbine (CCPAT) is then selected that matches the hydraulic characteristics
    of the network. In defining the CCPAT, various maximum heads are established to
    match local pressure conditions and ensure optimal utilization for power generation.
    The CCPAT curves are carefully matched to the flow rate and head in the system
    to maximize the extraction of available hydroelectric energy. The point where
    the characteristic curve of the system intersects with the characteristic curve
    of the PAT defines the operating point of the turbine. To simulate the implementation
    of pump-as-turbine (PAT) systems, the pressure-reducing valves (PRVs) in the EPANET
    model are replaced by general-purpose valves associated with the corresponding
    turbine characteristics. Then, following the principles of hydraulic similarity,
    characteristic curves are defined for different speeds (in an energy regulation
    mode). The relationship between electric power and hydraulic power generates several
    efficiency points that facilitate the preparation of an efficiency analysis. The
    main objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of energy recovery
    within the pilot zone of the Funchal water network through the use of PATs. Instead
    of replacing the PRVs in the distribution network, an alternative approach was
    adopted based on practical conditions. Since ensuring adequate water supply and
    controlling leakage are higher priorities, measures were taken to prevent any
    degradation of the existing pressure level in the system. The PATs were strategically
    positioned in series ahead of the PRVs to prevent a pressure rise in the event
    of a malfunction of the PAT. Various PAT configurations for power generation can
    be applied, as depicted in Figure 4, offering flexibility in implementing this
    technology. The primary objective in water distribution networks is to control
    water losses, as this is the most important means of conserving energy and water
    resources. This need is of financial importance to water utilities globally and
    results in significant savings across the spectrum of water-related processes
    that include extraction, treatment, transport, and distribution. In water supply
    systems (WSSs), hydraulic energy resources are sometimes abundant. This inherent
    characteristic makes water pipelines potential sources of renewable energy. Notably,
    discharge nodes exhibit constant daily variations in flow rates and heads. Consequently,
    accurate knowledge of energy availability is critical in predicting and delineating
    the economic benefits of using less energy for power generation. Control valves
    (CVs) are strategically positioned within water networks to separate regions of
    significant topographic elevation differences or reduce the remaining flow head
    at the end of pipelines. On the other hand, pressure-reducing valves (PRVs) are
    used to relieve excessive pressure in the network. However, converting excess
    pressure into electrical energy through pump-as-turbine systems (PAT) encounters
    certain limitations. The main difficulty in implementing PATs is the constant
    fluctuation of hydraulic conditions, characterized by varying flow rates and pressures
    depending on demand. The problems with energy recovery in water networks can be
    solved by utilizing a unique planning technique called variable operating strategy
    (VOS). PATs are made useful as energy generators in the water sector by VOS, which
    takes into account the temporal variations in flow rates and pressures. Hydraulic
    regulation (HR) and electric regulation (ER) can both benefit from the effective
    application of VOS to account for the fluctuating operating conditions brought
    on by daily water demands. It is crucial to integrate a control system for PATs
    in order to handle the fluctuating operating conditions brought on by daily water
    demand. Figure 4 illustrates the various PAT operating states: a) In hydraulic
    control mode (HR), the PAT installation scheme consists of two branches: a control
    valve and a PAT are connected in series in the first branch, which is the discharge/production
    branch; a regulating valve is installed in the second branch, which is the bypass
    (Figure 4a). When the head is available in HR mode—Hd is greater than the head
    that the machine supplies, Ht (points above the PAT characteristic—Figure 4b)—the
    excess pressure is released by the series-connected valve (Valve A). On the other
    hand, if Qd exceeds the available head (indicated by points below the PAT characteristic
    in Figure 4b), then a head higher than what is available is produced by the PAT.
    In such cases, Valve B opens up to lower the discharge from Qd to Qt within the
    PAT. To avoid exceeding the available head, the PAT is equipped with a bypass
    valve. When operating in ER mode, the generator’s speed adjusts to correspond
    with both flow rate and head at any given moment. Meanwhile, regardless of mode
    (HER), desired results are achieved by selecting an appropriate combination of
    valve regulation and machine rotational operating speed [34,35,36,37]. A variable
    operating strategy (VOS) employed within water distribution systems can optimize
    performance for both HR and ER modes via idealizing PAT selection. As far as mathematical
    considerations go, NR mode delivery occurs when points align on characteristic
    curve-to-network flow rates (as seen in Equation (4)): 𝐻 𝑡 = 𝐻 𝑡 ( 𝑄 𝑑 ) (4) where
    𝐻 𝑡 is the net head delivered by the PAT (m) and 𝑄 𝑑 is the available discharge
    ( m 3 /s ). In no regulation (NR) mode, three working regions can be defined as
    follows: Region 1— 𝑄 𝑖 < 𝑄 𝑡,𝑚𝑖𝑛 : 𝐸𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑦=0 ; Region 2— 𝑄 𝑖 > 𝑄 𝑡,𝑚𝑎𝑥 or 𝑄 𝑡,𝑚𝑖𝑛
    < 𝑄 𝑖 < 𝑄 𝑡,𝑚𝑎𝑥 and 𝐻 𝑡 > 𝐻 𝑖 : 𝐸𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑦=0 ; Region 3— 𝑄 𝑡,𝑚𝑖𝑛 < 𝑄 𝑖 < 𝑄 𝑡,𝑚𝑎𝑥   and
    𝐻 𝑡 < 𝐻 𝑖 : 𝐸=𝑃( 𝑄 𝑖 )Δ 𝑡 𝑖 . where 𝑄 𝑖 ,  𝐻 𝑖 are the flow and the available
    head in the instant i; 𝑄 𝑡 , 𝐻 𝑡 are the turbine flow and the net head delivered
    by the PAT; P is the power; and ∆t is the operation period. “min” and “max” are
    the operating extreme values of the PAT. In HR mode, the rotational speed of the
    PAT is fixed, and Valves (A) and (B) control the flow through the machine (Equation
    (5)): ⎧ ⎩ ⎨         𝐻 𝑑 = 𝐻 𝑡 ( 𝑄 𝑡 )+ 𝐻 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑣𝑒 𝑄 𝑑 = 𝑄 𝑡 + 𝑄 𝑏𝑦𝑝𝑎𝑠𝑠 𝐻
    𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑣𝑒 >0, 𝑄 𝑏𝑦𝑝𝑎𝑠𝑠 =0 𝑖𝑓  𝐻 𝑡 ( 𝑄 𝑡 )< 𝐻 𝑑 𝐻 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑣𝑒 =0, 𝑄 𝑏𝑦𝑝𝑎𝑠𝑠 >0 𝑖𝑓  𝐻 𝑡 ( 𝑄
    𝑑 )> 𝐻 𝑑 (5) where 𝐻 𝑑 , 𝐻 𝑡 are the available and the PAT head (m) ;  𝐻 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑣𝑒
    is the head delivered by the valve (m) ; 𝑄 𝑡 ,  𝑄 𝑑 are the turbine discharge
    ( m 3 /s) and the available discharge ( m 3 /s) ; 𝑄 𝑏𝑦𝑝𝑎𝑠𝑠 is the bypass discharge
    ( m 3 /s) . In HR mode, four working regions can be defined: Region 1— 𝑄 𝑖 < 𝑄
    𝑡,𝑚𝑖𝑛 or 𝐻 𝑖 < 𝐻 𝑡,𝑚𝑖𝑛 : 𝐸𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑦=0 ; Region 2— 𝑄 𝑡,𝑚𝑖𝑛 < 𝑄 𝑖 < 𝑄 𝑡,𝑚𝑎𝑥   and 𝐻
    𝑖 > 𝐻 𝑡 ( 𝑄 𝑖 ) : 𝐸𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑦=𝑃( 𝑄 𝑖 )Δ 𝑡 𝑖 ; Region 3— 𝑄 𝑡,𝑚𝑖𝑛 < 𝑄 𝑖 < 𝑄 𝑡,𝑚𝑎𝑥 and
    𝐻 𝑡,𝑚𝑖𝑛 < 𝐻 𝑖 < 𝐻 𝑡,𝑚𝑎𝑥 : 𝐸𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑦=𝑃( 𝑄 𝑡 ( 𝐻 𝑖 ))Δ 𝑡 𝑖 ; Region 4— 𝑄 𝑖 > 𝑄 𝑡,𝑚𝑎𝑥
    and 𝐻 𝑖 > 𝐻 𝑡,𝑚𝑎𝑥 : 𝐸𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑦=𝑃( 𝑄 𝑡,𝑚𝑎𝑥 )Δ 𝑡 𝑖 . In HER mode, the HR and the ER
    modes are coupled to improve the performance of the PAT (Equation (6)): ⎧ ⎩ ⎨
            𝐻 𝑑 = 𝐻 𝑡 ( 𝑄 𝑡 , 𝑁 𝑡 )+ 𝐻 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑣𝑒 𝑄 𝑑 = 𝑄 𝑡 ( 𝑁 𝑡 )+ 𝑄 𝑏𝑦𝑝𝑎𝑠𝑠 𝐻
    𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑣𝑒 >0, 𝑄 𝑏𝑦𝑝𝑎𝑠𝑠 =0 𝑖𝑓  𝐻 𝑡 ( 𝑄 𝑡 , 𝑁 𝑡 )< 𝐻 𝑑 𝐻 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑣𝑒 =0, 𝑄 𝑏𝑦𝑝𝑎𝑠𝑠 >0 𝑖𝑓  𝐻
    𝑡 ( 𝑄 𝑑 , 𝑁 𝑡 )> 𝐻 𝑑 (6) In HER mode, Valves (A) and (B) work together with the
    rotational speed regulation, allowing for better control of flow and head to maximize
    the energy production. Four working regions can be defined as follows: Region
    1— 𝑄 𝑖 < 𝑄 𝑡,𝑚𝑖𝑛 or 𝐻 𝑖 < 𝐻 𝑡,𝑚𝑖𝑛 : 𝐸𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑦=0 ; Region 2— 𝑄 𝑡,𝑚𝑖𝑛 < 𝑄 𝑖 < 𝑄 𝑡,𝑚𝑎𝑥
    and 𝐻 𝑖 > 𝐻 𝑡 ( 𝑄 𝑖 , 𝑁 𝑡 ) : 𝐸𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑦=𝑃( 𝑄 𝑖 )Δ 𝑡 𝑖 ; Region 3— 𝑄 𝑡,𝑚𝑖𝑛 ( 𝑁 𝑡 )<
    𝑄 𝑖 < 𝑄 𝑡,𝑚𝑎𝑥  ( 𝑁 𝑡 ) and 𝐻 𝑡,𝑚𝑖𝑛 ( 𝑄 𝑡 , 𝑁 𝑡 )< 𝐻 𝑖 < 𝐻 𝑡 ( 𝑄 𝑖 , 𝑁 𝑡 ) : 𝐸𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑦=𝑃(
    𝑄 𝑡 ( 𝐻 𝑖 ( 𝑁 𝑡 ))Δ 𝑡 𝑖 ; Region 4— 𝑄 𝑖 > 𝑄 𝑡,𝑚𝑎𝑥 ( 𝑁 𝑡 ) and 𝐻 𝑖 > 𝐻 𝑡,𝑚𝑎𝑥 (
    𝑁 𝑡 ) : 𝐸𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑦=𝑃( 𝑄 𝑡,𝑚𝑎𝑥 ( 𝑁 𝑡 ))Δ 𝑡 𝑖 . In these modes, the optimization process
    aims to achieve the combined values of flow ( 𝑄) and head ( 𝐻) that maximize the
    energy production. In order to face the limitations of the PAT operation for small
    flow values, a new PAT regulation strategy can also be presented: single–serial–parallel
    regulation mode (SSP). In SSP mode, the installation comprises two PATs and three
    on/off valves [34,35,36,37] (Figure 5). The installation scheme of the SSP mode
    is illustrated in Figure 5a. The SSP mode has three different working conditions
    that vary based on the daily demand, as depicted in Figure 5b). These conditions
    are as follows: (i) valve I and PAT A are on while valves II and III plus PAT
    B remain off, leading to a single energy-producing PAT; (ii) both valves II and
    III along with PATs A and B are turned on while valve I is off, resulting in series
    production of energy by the two PATs; (iii) both valves I and III are open with
    PAT A and B running parallel, resulting in double the flow compared to operating
    condition (i). An increased head for serial-operated turbines was observed during
    operation condition (ii), shown in Figure 5b, compared to a single turbine under
    operating state (i). Consequently, the flow rate doubled when parallel operating
    turbines were employed (under operating condition (iii)), also demonstrated in
    Figure 5b. Thus, it can be concluded that using the SSP mode is practical for
    recovering energy in small energy communities [34,35,36,37]. 2.3. Energy Simulator
    The next step is to develop simulations in the HOMER model (Figure 6), for which
    the site and load data requirements must first be determined. The location for
    the project’s case study is on Madeira Island. HOMER downloads data from NASA
    POWER to obtain wind speeds and solar radiation data. Figure 6. Energy simulator
    methodology. The load for the selected project must be entered into the model.
    The components for the microgrid must also be selected. Renewable components include
    photovoltaic, wind, and hydropower (PAT). Once the renewable components have been
    selected, their specifications and costs must be determined. Some of the specifications
    are already available in the HOMER library. For the cost specifications, experts
    in the field can be consulted, or various platforms that provide a cost estimate
    for components based on their capacity can be adapted. After all the data are
    entered, HOMER optimizes the hybrid system based on many combinations. These results
    also show electrical and economic results, which can be used for further analysis.
    2.4. Energy Production Power generation from pumps as turbines (PATs) is effectively
    analyzed and tracked using the HOMER energy optimization model. HOMER uses a grid
    search algorithm and a proprietary derivative-free algorithm to determine the
    most cost-effective microgrid model that meets load demand. The location chosen
    for these simulations is the city of Funchal in the Madeira Islands. The results
    of these simulations will provide valuable insight into the performance of PATs
    in power generation, especially when combined with hydropower. Specific data inputs
    are required to perform these simulations, including load requirements, capital
    and operating costs, replacement costs for all energy systems to be installed,
    and the availability of resources such as solar, wind, hydro, and biomass at the
    project site. The software obtains solar, wind, and temperature data from NASA’s
    Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resource database. To evaluate hydropower production
    with PATs, energy components such as solar arrays, wind turbines, hydropower,
    and grid connections are selected for the simulations. Considering the different
    water demands, the flow rates are determined. Winter flow is calculated as 0.7
    times summer flow. In comparison, spring and fall flows are assumed to be 0.85
    times summer flow, with the highest demand occurring in the summer. The simulation
    model shown in Figure 6 includes photovoltaic systems, wind turbines, the power
    grid, PATs (hydro turbines), a battery for storage, and an inverter to convert
    DC from photovoltaic systems to AC. For flows below 35 L/s, a 5 kW water turbine
    is used, while for flows above 35 L/s, a 10 kW water turbine is used. The model
    specifies these flow rates, with a nominal flow of 35 L/s for the 5 kW water turbine
    and 70 L/s for the 10 kW water turbine. The efficiency of the water turbines is
    set at 80% for both. The simulations are performed over a project life of 25 years,
    considering an inflation rate of 2% and a discount rate. To get as close as possible
    to real-time consumption patterns, hourly electricity consumption data for Portugal
    were taken from an open-source database from the website REN [42]. Then, the data
    adjustment was defined to represent the energy consumption at a smaller municipality
    level. The load data used in the simulations from HOMER show a peak electricity
    demand of 9.94 kW and an average daily energy consumption of 160.44 kWh. Over
    the year, the average electricity consumption is 6.68 kW. It is noteworthy that
    the highest monthly peak load occurs in January. A visual representation of the
    load distribution in each month can be found in Figure 7, which shows the load
    box plot for each month. Figure 7. Box plot of load demand considered for the
    simulations. Solar PV uses solar radiation to generate electricity. The use of
    solar PV renewable energy systems has been growing rapidly in recent years. The
    calculation of electricity generated by solar PV in the model is calculated as
    follows: 𝑃 𝑃𝑉 = 𝑌 𝑃𝑉 𝑓 𝑃𝑉 ( 𝐺 𝑇 𝐺 𝑇,𝑆𝑇𝐶 ) [1+ 𝛼 𝑃 ( 𝑇 𝑐 − 𝑇 𝑐,𝑆𝑇𝐶 )] (7) where
    𝑌 𝑃𝑉 = power output during standard test conditions in kW. 𝑓 𝑃𝑉 = derating factor
    of solar PV. 𝐺 𝑇 = incident solar irradiance in kW/ m 2 . 𝐺 𝑇,𝑆𝑇𝐶 = incident solar
    irradiance at Standard test conditions, which is 1 kW/ m 2 . 𝛼 𝑃 = temperature
    co-efficient of power. 𝑇 𝑐 = cell temperature of solar PV in °C. 𝑇 𝑐,𝑆𝑇𝐶 = cell
    temperature under standard test conditions, which is 25 °C. Another renewable
    energy system growing in today’s market is wind energy. Many innovative wind turbine
    models are on the rise to harness wind energy on both large and small scales.
    The wind turbine considered for the case study simulation is a generic 3 kW wind
    turbine predefined by the model. It first calculates the wind speed at hub height
    using the following equation: 𝑈 ℎ𝑢𝑏 = 𝑈 𝑎𝑛𝑒𝑚 · ln( 𝑍 ℎ𝑢𝑏 𝑍 0 ) ln( 𝑍 𝑎𝑛𝑒𝑚 𝑍 0
    ) (8) where 𝑈 ℎ𝑢𝑏 = wind speed at the hub height of the wind turbine in m/s. 𝑈
    𝑎𝑛𝑒𝑚 = wind speed at the anemometer height in m/s. 𝑍 ℎ𝑢𝑏 = hub height of the wind
    turbine in m. 𝑍 0 = the surface roughness length in m. 𝑍 𝑎𝑛𝑒𝑚 = anemometer height
    in m. After calculating the wind speed at hub height, the model considers the
    wind turbine’s power curve to calculate the power generated by the wind turbine
    under standard temperature and pressure conditions. To obtain the power generated
    under real conditions, the model uses the following equation: 𝑃 𝑊𝑇𝐺 =( 𝜌 𝜌 0 )·
    𝑃 𝑊𝑇𝐺,𝑆𝑇𝑃 (9) where 𝑃 𝑊𝑇𝐺 = output power of wind turbine in kW. 𝑃 𝑊𝑇𝐺,𝑆𝑇𝑃 = output
    power of wind turbine at standard temperature and pressure in kW. 𝜌 = actual air
    density in kg/ m 3 . 𝜌 0 = air density at STP, which is 1.225 kg/ m 3 . Hydropower
    is one of the oldest techniques of energy generation. For this research, a 5 kW
    hydro turbine was chosen for lower flow rates and a 10 kW hydro turbine for higher
    flow rates. These water turbines represent the PATs that can be installed at the
    locations of the pressure-reducing valves. The calculation for the water turbine,
    which is a PAT, is given as follows: 𝑃 ℎ𝑦𝑑 = ŋ ℎ𝑦𝑑 · 𝜌 𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟 ·𝑔· ℎ 𝑛𝑒𝑡 · 𝑄 ˙ 𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑏𝑖𝑛𝑒
    (10) where 𝑃 ℎ𝑦𝑑 = hydro turbine power output in kW. ŋ ℎ𝑦𝑑 = efficiency of hydro
    turbine in %. 𝜌 𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟 = water density, which is 1000 kg/ m 3 . g = acceleration
    due to gravity 9.81 m/ s 2 . ℎ 𝑛𝑒𝑡 = effective head in m. 𝑄 ˙ 𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑏𝑖𝑛𝑒 = hydro
    turbine flow rate in m 3 /s . The simulation for all selected valves had the same
    load and the same renewable energy microgrid system (Figure 8) to better understand
    the LCOE, NPC, and other economic parameters. Figure 8. Microgrid system for all
    simulations of PATs and other components. 2.5. Methodology for the Analysis of
    Results The HOMER model acts as an optimizer for renewable energy systems, offering
    potential and feasible solutions. It selects the case with the lowest net present
    cost (NPBC) for a comprehensive analysis. It also performs detailed calculations
    to evaluate the benefits of incorporating pumps as turbines (PATs) into the microgrid
    system. The Electrical Analysis component of HOMER provides valuable insight into
    the role of PATs in power generation. It allows for the power generation of all
    power systems to be considered. It provides insight into each system’s individual
    contribution and the lowest electricity cost (LCOE). It also provides insight
    into grid purchase and recovery values, facilitating analysis of the interplay
    between each energy component’s power generation and its impact on costs and benefits.
    Sensitivity analysis is proving to be a valuable tool for understanding the importance
    and role of a power system within the microgrid system. Manipulating parameters
    such as the capital cost multiplier or the costs associated with a power system
    identifies a microgrid system with the lowest NPC, providing important insights
    for decision-making and optimization (Figure 9). Figure 9. Procedure for analysis
    of results. The net present cost of the system is all costs of the project incurred
    during its life and reported at present value. This includes O&M costs, capital
    costs, and replacement costs. These costs are calculated by HOMER using the discount
    factor to obtain discounted cash flows. 𝑁𝑃𝐶=𝐶𝑎𝑝𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝐶𝑜𝑠𝑡+𝑅𝑒𝑝𝑙𝑎𝑐𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝐶𝑜𝑠𝑡+𝑂&𝑀
    𝐶𝑜𝑠𝑡+𝑔𝑟𝑖𝑑 𝑝𝑢𝑟𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑠𝑒 𝑐𝑜𝑠𝑡−𝑆𝑎𝑙𝑣𝑎𝑔𝑒  (11) Levelized cost of energy production (LCOE)
    is the ratio of the annual average cost of the project and the total electricity
    load served. LCOE is an essential economic factor in considering the attraction
    towards a project. This is calculated using the following equation: 𝐿𝐶𝑂𝐸= 𝐶 𝑎𝑛𝑛,𝑡𝑜𝑡
    𝐸 𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑑 (12) where 𝐶 𝑎𝑛𝑛,𝑡𝑜𝑡 = total annualized cost of the system in EUR/year.
    𝐸 𝑠𝑒𝑟𝑣𝑒𝑑 = total electrical energy served in kWh/year. The model uses the nominal
    interest and inflation rates as inputs to calculate the real discount rate. This
    is used to calculate the discount factor, which is used to calculate the annualized
    cost. The calculation for the discount rate is as follows: 𝑖= 𝑖 ′ −𝑓 1+𝑓 (13)
    where i = real discount rate. 𝑖 ′ = nominal discount rate. f = expected inflation
    rate. According to the simulation in this research, 𝑖 ′ = 8% and f = 2%, and i
    can easily be calculated by 𝑖= 0.08−0.02 1+0.02 =0.059 (14) The discount factor
    is a ratio that can be used to obtain the present value of costs in any year of
    the project. This factor is used to express, at present value, the savings that
    will be realized over the project’s life. The discount factor can be calculated
    using the following equation: 𝑓 𝑑 = 1 (1+𝑖) 𝑁 (15) where 𝑓 𝑑 = discount factor.
    i = real discount rate. N = number of years. The discount factor in all simulations
    in this research for the 25th year can be calculated as follows: 𝑓 𝑑 = 1 (1+0.059)
    25 =0.238 The renewable energy investment is the NPC of all renewable energy systems
    installed in the microgrid system. This value is calculated by subtracting the
    grid purchase cost from the total useful life. This value indicates the actual
    investment made in renewable energy. 𝑁𝑃𝐶 𝑜𝑓 𝑅𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑤𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒𝑠=𝑁𝑃𝐶 𝑜𝑓 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑗𝑒𝑐𝑡−𝑔𝑟𝑖𝑑 𝑝𝑢𝑟𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑠
    (16) The main benefit of installing renewable energy systems is the consumption
    of locally generated energy. The savings can be determined by calculating the
    total energy produced by all renewable energy and calculating the bills that would
    have to be paid if the same energy was consumed from the grid. This value shows
    the monetary savings from consuming energy without paying bills. The value is
    calculated by multiplying the grid purchase cost, set at 0.258 kW/h, by the energy
    generated by the renewable energy sources during the project period. The meaning
    of this value is derived from calculating the value of net present cost savings.
    𝑆𝑎𝑣𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑠 𝑎𝑡 0.258 € kWh grid price ={𝑆𝑜𝑙𝑎𝑟 𝑃𝑉 ( 𝑘𝑊ℎ 𝑦𝑟 )+𝐻𝑦𝑑𝑟𝑜( 𝑘𝑊ℎ 𝑦𝑟 )+𝑊𝑖𝑛𝑑(
    𝑘𝑊ℎ 𝑦𝑟 )}×0.258  € kWh ×25 𝑦𝑟 (17) Net present savings is an external calculation
    created from the software results to highlight the microgrid’s economic advantage
    and the contribution of PATs. This value is the cost savings over the project’s
    life, expressed as a present value. This value is calculated by multiplying the
    cost savings over the project’s life by the discount factor (fd). This value gives
    an idea of the profits that can be calculated by deducting the savings, i.e.,
    the revenues from the renewable energy NPC. 𝑁𝑒𝑡 𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑆𝑎𝑣𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑠=0.238×𝑆𝑎𝑣𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑠
    𝑎𝑡 0.258  € kWh  𝑔𝑟𝑖𝑑 𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒 (18) Net present value (NPV) is the difference between
    the revenue or savings generated by the project discounted to the current year
    of consideration. A positive NPV means that the project is attractive. When the
    project is initiated, the NPV can be calculated as follows: 𝑁𝑃𝑉=𝑁𝑃𝐶−𝑁𝑒𝑡 𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑡
    𝑆𝑎𝑣𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑠 (19) Return on investment (ROI) is an essential factor when considering
    the investment in a project. It is calculated by dividing the profits by the cost
    of the project. ROI for the simulation results is calculated externally in this
    research by calculating the net profit, which is the difference between the renewable
    energy investment and the net savings. This value is further divided by the renewable
    energy investment as shown in the equation: 𝑅𝑂𝐼= 𝑁𝑒𝑡 𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝐶𝑜𝑠𝑡 𝑆𝑎𝑣𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑠 (€)−𝑁𝑃𝐶
    𝑜𝑓 𝑅𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑤𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒𝑠(€) 𝑁𝑃𝐶 𝑜𝑓 𝑅𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑤𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒𝑠 (€) (20) The costs are entered into the model
    to calculate the lowest-cost microgrid system. These costs are used to calculate
    net present costs (NPCs), LCOE, CAPEX, and OPEX. The cost of photovoltaic systems
    has been decreasing over the years, and the cost of simulating photovoltaic systems
    includes all equipment, including wiring and labor for installation. The cost
    of the wind turbine, battery, and inverter are predefined in the software package
    HOMER. The grid electricity price is set at 0.258 EUR/kWh, and the grid feedback
    price at 0.030 EUR/kWh. The costs of the different components used are listed
    in Table 1. Table 1. Costs of various components used in the simulation. 3. Results
    and Discussion 3.1. Brief system Definition The investigation of energy recovery
    methods in this study was carried out using a specific framework aimed at controlling
    water losses. This study was carried out in the municipality of Funchal (CMF),
    in a pilot area where a comprehensive study on the control of water losses had
    previously been developed (Figure 10). Figure 10. Funchal municipality (dark blue)
    and pilot zone (light blue). The municipality’s water supply system benefits from
    the natural topography and relies on gravity reservoirs that receive water from
    the Águas e Resíduos da Madeira (ARM) supply system and neighboring municipalities.
    Given the predominantly residential nature of the region and the high population
    density, water consumption is remarkably high, requiring an efficient and well-managed
    system. However, a thorough analysis of the components of water losses based on
    data provided by the Camara Municipal do Funchal (CMF) revealed the urgent need
    to implement a strategy focused on reducing actual water losses, representing
    90% of total losses in the pilot zone. Furthermore, the total water losses comprised
    over 60% of the entire amount discharged into the system. This presents a notable
    financial obstacle to the water utility and poses an ecological danger to its
    ecosystem. These circumstances emphasize that there is a pressing need to diminish
    water losses below 20%, as dictated by national protocols. The overarching strategy
    was developed based on the Institute for Water and Waste Regulation (IRAR) Leakage
    Control Protocol to address and correct the situation described above. This protocol
    includes several essential steps, including the following: Establishment of district
    metered areas (DMAs): This means creating defined zones within the distribution
    system to facilitate the metering and regulation of pressure levels and flow rates
    in each area. In the first phase, the primary areas of influence are delineated.
    Effective pressure management: This step focuses on properly regulating pressure
    to avoid excessive water loss and ensure adequate water supply to consumers. Active
    damage control: In this phase, measures are taken to detect and repair leaks in
    the system in good time. The following subsections provide a comprehensive overview
    of the current situation and elaborate on the specific procedures used to address
    this issue. 3.2. Hydraulic Simulations 3.2.1. Hydraulic Scenarios To gain insight
    into the causes of water loss and determine the most effective loss control strategy,
    a basic hydraulic model was created using EPANET software. This step proved critical
    in conducting a diagnostic assessment of current circumstances. It helped inform
    decision-making regarding establishing district metering areas and intermediate
    pressure stages. These elements were the initial building blocks for creating
    the “New Situation” model (see Figure 11). The hydraulic simulation used the Hazen–Williams
    equation to compute head losses by applying distinct roughness coefficients: values
    of 140 for recently installed HDPE or cast iron pipelines, 130 for pre-existing
    HDPE or cast iron pipes, 120 for steel or PVC pipes, and, lastly, 100 was used
    for fiber and galvanized metal pipe material. Figure 11. Selected PRV for PAT
    implementation. In an initial review of the hydraulically constructed model, we
    found specific deficiencies in the hierarchical structure of the network. In addition,
    the evaluation showed that the pressure drops in the network were relatively low,
    which could lead to increased water pressure and consequently to the risk of fractures
    and leaks. This problem is visually represented in Figure 12a, where areas exceeding
    the legal maximum pressure of 60 m of water column (m w.c.) are highlighted in
    yellow. Consumption requirements in the intersections are shown in Figure 12b.
    Figure 12. EPANET model—pressure levels in network junctions (a) and consumption
    demand on network junctions (b). The EPANET model developed has proven invaluable
    in providing crucial insights into the pressure dynamics of the water network.
    On average, the pressure is about 53 m w.c. and occasionally rises to about 100
    m w.c. The developed model corresponds to the current situation and includes all
    previously defined mitigation measures, such as implementing newly installed PRVs
    and establishing new DMAs. Figure 13 shows the EPANET model, which shows the network
    nodes’ pressure levels and consumption demand. Figure 13. The current situation
    is spatial pressure distribution at 13:00 (a) and a percentage of less than a
    particular pressure value (b). The hydraulic simulator model was significantly
    improved as part of the new improved scenario. This included the creation of 30
    new district metered areas (DMAs) with an average extent of 6 km each. In addition,
    50 new pressure-reducing valves (PRVs) were added to the model to provide additional
    pressure levels. In addition, certain existing valves were adjusted, i.e., both
    opened and closed, and approximately 11 km of new piping was added to the network.
    These measures enabled a more uniform pressure distribution, resulting in lower
    average and maximum pressure values (Figure 14). Figure 14. New situation spatial
    pressure distribution at 13:00 (a) and percentage of less than a particular pressure
    value (b). After simulating this revised scenario, a brief analysis of the results
    revealed several noteworthy findings: (i) The pressure values of the network decreased
    to an average value of about 37 m w.c., which is a decrease of 16 m w.c. compared
    to the previous scenario. (ii) Only 4% of the nodes in the network registered
    a minimum pressure above the legal maximum of 60 m w.c.—a significant decrease
    (35%) from the previous scenario. Moreover, this figure increased slightly to
    5% when studied under static boundary conditions, in stark contrast to the 50%
    recorded in the existing scenario. (iii) It is particularly noteworthy that most
    of the network is no longer under excessive pressure, with an average reduction
    of about 1.6 bar compared to the current situation. These results underscore that
    the excessive pressure from sectorization efforts has been significantly alleviated.
    In the new scenario, the proportion of the network exposed to high pressure decreased
    significantly, and pressure fluctuations decreased noticeably. To illustrate,
    in the current model, 40% of the network nodes were exposed to pressures above
    60 m w.c. In the new model, this number increased to almost 6%. In addition, it
    is essential to highlight the establishment of new district metered areas (DMAs)
    and the introduction of additional pressure-reducing valves (PRVs). In addition,
    the existing pressure-reducing valves with different pressure drops were fine-tuned,
    and flow meters were strategically placed in front of these valves. These measures
    were implemented to recalibrate the pressure in the network and exert better control
    over flow dynamics. Overall, these improvements reduced water losses and lowered
    the probability of system breaks in the distribution network. 3.2.2. PRV and PAT
    Characteristics Without data on PRV prices, a correlation between valve diameter
    and price is assumed based on multiple valves from a particular manufacturer (Tecnilab).
    The estimated cost of PRVs was derived from available average market prices (Table
    2). These costs are comparable to the costs of PATs. Recent studies [43] show
    a cost comparison of four different PAT options: a radial pump with one, two,
    or three pairs of magnetic poles (pp) and a vertical multistage pump with one
    pair of magnetic poles. The radial pumps (the most commonly used) have similar
    costs and are less expensive than vertical multistage pumps. The vertical pumps
    are more efficient for a more extensive flow range. Table 2. PRV price *. For
    the PAT application, the price for each PAT is determined based on the maximum
    power of each device. The price varies with the maximum power generated by each
    PAT: the greater the installed power, the lower the unit cost (Figure 15). Figure
    15. Proposed PAT unit cost vs. power based on several machines. Despite the availability
    of numerous potential sites for energy recovery based on the location of PRVs,
    only ten pressure-reducing valves (PRVs) were selected for pump-as-turbine (PAT)
    installation (Table 3). This selection was deemed sufficient to gather the necessary
    data to evaluate the energy recovery potential of the network in small communities
    with local power generation. The selection process included a preliminary assessment
    of each PRV’s suitability for PAT implementation. Specifically, the pressure drop
    provided for each PRV was multiplied by its flow rate. Then, the 10 PRVs with
    the highest values, represented as QH (flow rate multiplied by pressure drop),
    were selected for subsequent in-depth analysis. Table 3. PRVs selected for PAT
    implementation. Some options have been defined. The results of the optimal fixed
    ER energy for each PRV site, along with the respective optimal PAT selection and
    rotation speed, are shown in Table 4. Note that the NR mode does not correspond
    to each PAT’s optimal energy recovery scenario. Table 4 shows the selected PAT
    type, optimal fixed rotation speed, and energy production. Table 4. Type of PAT
    for optimal fixed rotation speed and energy production. A careful examination
    of Table 4 reveals a discernible correlation between the power generated and the
    pump as turbine (PAT) speed. This relationship is likely a result of the typically
    higher flow rates in pressure-reducing valves (PRVs) with greater energy output,
    which require higher speeds for the PATs to achieve their optimum energy recovery
    capability. However, an exception to this trend is PAT 100–200 in PRV TR08B, which
    produces three times the power compared to PAT 65–250 in PRV SM04.5B, although
    it has a lower speed. This discrepancy can be attributed to the broader characteristic
    curve of PAT 100–200 at the rated speed, which affects the optimum speed. Another
    crucial aspect is the relationship between the maximum energy generated and the
    appropriate PAT selection for each scenario. While PAT 100–200 proves optimal
    for PRV TR08B, PRV MP02.5A-1 provides the highest energy yield when paired with
    PAT 65–200. This phenomenon underscores that higher energy production is often
    associated with higher discharge rates and head, which typically requires larger
    turbomachinery to maximize energy recovery potential. 3.3. HOMER Simulation The
    simulations conducted as part of HOMER provide valuable insight into the economics
    and power generation within the microgrid. These simulations illuminate the central
    role that pumps as turbines (PATs) play in the economic dynamics of the project.
    The methodology includes the definition of various economic terms. It presents
    results demonstrating the cost benefits of incorporating PATs into microgrids.
    The optimization process of the software revolves around meeting electricity demand
    through the judicious use of energy systems and available resources. The simulations
    consider different flow values with an underlying constraint on grid purchases
    that aims to limit CO2 emissions to 10,000 kg/year. The results of these simulations
    highlight the importance of hydropower through PATs in reducing costs and increasing
    profits in a relatively short time frame. It is worth noting that the TR08B valve
    has the highest net present value (NPV) and economic benefit, primarily due to
    a higher flow rate. Conversely, the lowest NPV was observed for valve TR06.5B.
    In addition, hydropower, represented by PATs, has the lowest LCOE compared to
    all other energy systems considered in all scenarios studied. Table 5 summarizes
    the economic benefits using metrics such as return on investment (ROI) and net
    present value to consolidate the economic aspects. Table 6 summarizes the technical
    results of all scenarios to provide a comprehensive overview. Table 5. Brief simulation
    results after optimization with HOMER for different valves and a lifetime of 25
    Years. Table 6. Contribution of all energy systems in the microgrid and electrical
    specifications. Using power generation from water distribution networks and exploring
    small-scale hydropower generation opportunities are new technologies that contrast
    with established large-scale hydropower facilities. The resulting findings relate
    to the economics of the proposed project. Determination of renewable resource
    investment, grid price savings, net savings (NPS), and net present value (NPV)
    was performed externally following the equations presented in the Methodology
    section. Table 5 shows a consistent positive NPV for all project scenarios where
    PATs replace or are coupled with existing NPVs, depending on the pressure control
    required. This indicates that the project delivers favorable outcomes and is an
    enticing investment opportunity. It can be seen that an increased contribution
    of hydropower or an increased value of QH leads to a corresponding increase in
    NPV, highlighting the direct correlation between hydropower production and the
    NPV of the project, as visually illustrated in Figure 16. Figure 16. NPV vs. QH
    for all the valves replaced with PATs in the microgrid. The most important source
    of savings and benefits is in avoiding the purchase of grid electricity. Solar
    photovoltaic (PV) systems are limited to daylight hours. At the same time, small-scale
    wind energy has variable power output, reducing reliability. Hydroelectric PATs
    can generate power throughout the day, which is consistent with the constant demand
    for water. Most importantly, the higher flow rates (QH) associated with PATs,
    such as the TR08B valve, contribute to their cost-effectiveness, as shown in the
    LCOE data in Table 6. These versatile PAT devices are used in various contexts,
    including small watercourses, water treatment plants, distribution networks, and
    more. The favorable LCOE profile of PATs results in significant cost benefits,
    especially when integrated into municipal networks with the necessary engineering
    considerations. This integration can lead to lower energy costs for consumers.
    In addition, PATs play a central role in smart cities, particularly in response
    to the increasing demand for electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure. Given
    the rise in summer tourism associated with high water demand, off-grid technologies
    using PATs offer a significant advantage in relieving the strain on the power
    grid associated with EV charging. Using PATs can potentially reduce the cost of
    electric vehicle charging, which benefits a broader consumer base. The most important
    source of savings and benefits is in avoiding the purchase of grid electricity.
    Solar photovoltaic (PV) systems are limited to daylight hours. At the same time,
    small-scale wind energy has variable output, resulting in reduced reliability.
    Hydroelectric PATs for hydropower can generate power throughout the day, consistent
    with the constant demand for water. Most importantly, the higher flow rates (QH)
    associated with PATs, e.g., through valves such as the TR08B valve, contribute
    to their cost-effectiveness, as shown in the LCOE data in Table 6. These versatile
    PAT devices are used in various applications, including small watercourses, water
    treatment plants, distribution networks, and more. The favorable LCOE profile
    of PATs results in significant cost benefits, especially when integrated into
    municipal networks while addressing networks with the necessary technical requirements.
    This integration can lead to lower energy costs for consumers. In addition, PATs
    play a central role in smart cities, especially in response to the increasing
    demand for electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure. Given the increase in
    summer tourism associated with high water demand, off-grid technologies that use
    PATs offer a significant advantage in relieving the strain on the power grid associated
    with electric vehicle charging. Using PATs can potentially reduce the cost of
    electric vehicle charging, which benefits a broader consumer base. MP-02.5A-1:
    Illustration of the valve with the lowest flow value. SM04.5B: Identifies the
    valve with a flow value approximately equal to the average flow of all valves.
    TR08B: Designates the valve with the highest flow value. These three scenarios
    provide insight into how the model responds when integrating different energy
    systems. The main objective of the model is to optimize the microgrid system to
    achieve the most cost-effective configuration while ensuring that energy needs
    are met. This optimization strategy, known as “load tracking”, prioritizes the
    satisfaction of load demand. Table 7 lists the codes for each energy component.
    Figure 17a–c graphically illustrate the power generation required to meet the
    different load demands for the various microgrid configurations defined in these
    cases. Figure 17. Electricity production with different components of the microgrid
    for the valves: (a) MP-02.5A-1, (b) SM04.5B, (c) TR08B. Table 7. Energy system
    code identification. All energy systems are integrated into the microgrid system
    with the valve MP-02.5A-1 to cover the energy demand. On the other hand, in the
    case of valve SM04.5B with a flow rate of 43.12 L/s, the wind turbine is excluded
    from the configuration due to the higher energy production of the PAT’s hydro
    power, which has a more favorable LCOE. In particular, in the case of valve TR08B,
    with a flow rate of 152.41 L/s, only the PAT (hydro power) is used since it is
    sufficient to meet the power demand without additional power systems. The grid
    is used in all cases, as there is a possibility to export surplus electricity
    to the grid as well. The transition from excluding high-cost energy systems at
    the lowest flow value of hydropower to using PATs exclusively at the highest flow
    value underscores the importance of PATs as a cost-effective solution for small
    communities. Figure 18a–c visually represent the power consumption within the
    microgrid energy system. These figures illustrate the operation of the microgrid
    system and the energy output of all the energy systems to meet the energy demand.
    The grid draws decrease as the water capacity increases. In the case of TR08B
    (Case 3), not only is the demand met, but excess energy is also generated, resulting
    in a negative net cost. The main objective of a microgrid is to reduce costs while
    ensuring continuous load demand coverage. Figure 18. Meeting load demand with
    all the energy systems of the microgrid for the valves: (a) MP-02.5A-1, (b) SM04.5B,
    and (c) TR08B. A sensitivity analysis was performed for the three selected cases
    to evaluate the variation in power system configurations. Figure 19a–c illustrate
    the optimal cost-effective solutions with varying capital costs for solar PV and
    a constant capital cost of 0.3 for the wind turbine. Notably, the wind turbine
    has the highest LCOE compared to the other power systems. The variations in grid
    purchase price were between 0.1 EUR/kWh and 0.5 EUR/kWh. Figure 19. Sensitivity
    analysis with wind turbine capital cost multiplier of 0.3 for the valve: (a) MP-02.5A-1,
    (b) SM04.5B, (c) TR08B. Considering all these variables, we see that hydropower
    remains a consistent component across all sensitivity cases, underscoring the
    indispensability of the pump as a turbine (PAT), even given the cost variations
    in solar PV, grid, and wind turbine. In the baseline case with the MP-02.5A-1
    valve, a significant portion of the sensitivity spectrum is covered by the optimal
    combination of solar PV, wind turbine, hydropower, and grid. However, this dominance
    decreases in the case of valve SM04.5B, where the flow rate of the turbine is
    higher. This increase in flow rate leads to higher electricity generation from
    PATs, which have the lowest LCOE. Remarkably, the last case uses only hydropower,
    which consistently results in negative net cost (NPC). This is due to the sufficient
    hydropower generation that not only meets the load demand but also generates a
    surplus of electricity that exceeds the installation cost due to the revenue from
    grid recovery. The sensitivity analysis, which includes variations in photovoltaic,
    wind turbine, and grid purchase costs within the specified range, consistently
    emphasizes the need to include hydropower in all conceivable energy systems to
    achieve the lowest NPC for meeting load demand. Through this sensitivity analysis,
    it can be conclusively stated that PATs are a cost-effective approach to small-scale
    renewable energy. It is essential to note that this study is based on estimated
    averages for the different seasons. In addition, the limitations of HOMER, which
    restrict the inclusion of multiple hydro turbines, mean that this study cannot
    explore the full potential of multiple PATs within a microgrid system. Nonetheless,
    alternative tools can be used to explore the full integration of PATs in such
    systems. In summary, all of the simulations of HOMER in the various cases and
    scenarios aimed to satisfy electricity demand through selected small energy community
    systems, and while these systems may vary depending on the load size, hydropower
    remains a central component for cost-effective power generation throughout. This
    research paves the way for future studies in smart cities and in various small
    energy communities (i.e., topographic features, flow and drop heights, solar radiation
    and wind availability, and type of turbines) where sophisticated systems can be
    deployed to harness energy from PATs for integration into the microgrid. These
    future studies could also include demand forecasting based on weather patterns
    and components that influence electricity prices and promise economic benefits
    and opportunities in distributed renewable generation. 4. Conclusions The world’s
    water supply systems face high energy consumption and water loss due to poor management
    and inadequate water utility practices. Frequent breaks and leaks in these networks
    are associated with inadequate water pressure regulation, which reduces system
    efficiency and increases demand for water and energy. This mismanagement strains
    water and energy resources, which are critical in today’s society and environmental
    context, especially with the increasing threat of climate change and population
    growth exacerbating water scarcity. Addressing water losses and energy inefficiencies
    is essential for sustainable development without compromising the quality of life
    of future generations. A new optimized method is proposed to achieve the following:
    - Integrate micro-hydropower plants into water distribution systems, creating
    hybrid energy solutions. - Replace or add pressure control valves with PATs, allowing
    for clean power generation while maintaining pressure levels within certain limits.
    - Apply a real case study for an alternative solution, using the Funchal water
    network as an ideal case study for implementing this energy recovery method. -
    Demonstrate suitable locations for pressure-reducing valves (PRVs) and for the
    implementation of PATs. - A comprehensive analysis of the system’s operation to
    evaluate the economic feasibility of the investment. A simulation model for hydraulics
    developed by EPA, USA (EPANET), and for energy systems developed by the National
    Renewable Energy Laboratory in the USA (HOMER Pro) were used. This study uses
    the model to analyze the economic benefits of using pumps as turbines (PATs) for
    small-scale power generation and to gain insights into how microgrids can meet
    energy demand with PATs. Sensitivity analysis is performed to evaluate the variability
    of the microgrid system in response to variations in the cost of its energy components.
    The economic analysis shows favorable results for integrating PATs with a positive
    net present value (NPV). The highest NPV was obtained for the TR08B valve with
    a maximum flow rate of 152.41 L/s. The grid-connected microgrid system includes
    PV solar, wind turbines, and hydropower. The sensitivity analysis results consistently
    show the economic viability of PATs under different scenarios, even when the costs
    of PV, wind turbines, and grid infrastructure are reduced. In all simulation cases,
    PATs have the lowest electricity (LCOE) cost compared to other energy systems,
    confirming their economic feasibility and efficiency. Based on the comprehensive
    methodology developed, it is clear that pumps as turbines (PATs) occupy a central
    role in cost-effective small-scale power generation. Consequently, many PATs have
    emerged as alternatives to conventional turbines due to their cost-effectiveness,
    accessibility, and reasonable efficiency. To evaluate the feasibility of this
    technology, the water distribution system in Funchal, Portugal served as a case
    study for implementing several PATs in conjunction with pressure-reducing valves
    (PRVs) at sites with significant energy recovery potential. The following are
    the main conclusions from this part: i. Variable-speed electrical regulation (ER)
    is preferable to a fixed-speed ER because it provides slightly higher performance
    for the exact equipment cost. ii. The “no regulation” mode (NR) is an unsuitable
    investment because it cannot adapt to fluctuating flow conditions, resulting in
    limited energy output. iii. Of the 50 newly implemented PRVs in Funchal’s water
    distribution system, only 10 PRVs were deemed viable for PAT. These PRVs together
    generate 406 MWh/year of energy, with a combined net present value. Hydraulic
    analysis shows significant potential for hydroelectric generation, especially
    in small communities where favorable topographic conditions for power generation
    in inclined grids lead to promising economic and energy results. This also contributes
    to positive environmental impacts by promoting the sustainability of water distribution.
    In energy analysis, the HOMER model, used by professionals in over 150 countries
    for microgrid projects, provides optimized solutions that achieve the lowest net
    present cost (NPC) while meeting load demand. The main objective of using this
    model in research is to highlight the importance of PATs in achieving economic
    benefits from small-scale power generation. Key findings from this part of the
    analysis include the following: i. Various PRVs were identified, and simulations
    were performed for each local system without changing the load and other power
    system specifications, such as capital, O&M, and replacement costs. ii. All simulations
    for all valves resulted in positive net present values, and additional analyses
    were performed to understand the nature of the economic benefits resulting from
    increased electricity generation from micro-hydro using PATs. iii. PV solar and
    micro-wind turbines installed in small DMAs in Funchal’s water distribution system
    produce 153 MWh/year and 55 MWh/year, respectively, adding to the 406 MWh/year
    generated by PATs. This adds up to 615 MWh/year at the ten selected PRV sites
    within Funchal’s water network alone. In addition, the sensitivity analysis shows
    that the inclusion of PATs remains a cost-effective solution for various scenarios
    with capital cost multipliers for solar PV, wind, and grid purchase costs. This
    methodology currently considers the inclusion of a hydro turbine for the simulations.
    Future research incorporating multiple PATs will provide deeper insights into
    the different types of microgrid behavior in smart cities and communities. The
    integration of the micro-hydropower systems could contribute with other clean
    energy systems to achieve having zero non-renewable resources in the water cycle.

    Energy Transition in Urban Water Infrastructures towards Sustainable Cities. Water,
    16(3), 504.
  journal: Water (Switzerland)
  key_findings: The study demonstrates the potential of PATs for energy recovery in
    water distribution networks, with positive net present value (NPV) and economic
    benefits. The integration of PATs with photovoltaic and wind turbine systems can
    further enhance the system's efficiency and sustainability. Sensitivity analysis
    shows that the inclusion of PATs remains a cost-effective solution under various
    scenarios with capital cost multipliers for solar PV, wind, and grid purchase
    costs.
  limitations: This study is limited to a specific case study in Funchal, Portugal,
    and the results may not be generalizable to other water distribution networks
    with different characteristics. Additionally, the study assumes that PATs can
    be installed without major technical or economic constraints, which may not be
    the case in all scenarios.
  main_objective: To evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of using pumps-as-turbines
    (PATs) for energy recovery in water distribution networks.
  relevance_evaluation: 'The paper is highly relevant to the specific point of interest
    because it focuses directly on evaluating the use of pumps-as-turbines (PATs)
    as a means of energy recovery in water distribution networks, which aligns with
    the outline point of providing user-friendly interfaces for farmers to input preferences
    and expert knowledge into automated irrigation systems, using techniques like
    participatory design or user-centered design.


    The paper addresses the specific issue of harnessing energy that would otherwise
    be lost via hydraulic systems for real-time irrigation management. The study provides
    valuable insights and evidence to support the use of PATs as an effective method
    for energy recovery in water distribution networks, contributing to the broader
    discussion on automated irrigation management systems.

    Introduction Agriculture plays a pivotal role in the global food production and
    supply chain, and is constantly adapting to meet the recurring challenges it faces.
    The adoption of Digital Agricultural Technologies (DATs) has emerged as a prominent
    aspect of this transformative process, offering a forward-thinking perspective
    within the agricultural domain [1]. DATs broadly encompass a suite of technologies
    including precision agriculture, remote sensing, and data analytics. They differ
    from other technologies by providing an integrated approach that combines various
    digital tools and platforms to revolutionise traditional farming practices, whereas
    smart farming often refers to the application of IoT and connectivity solutions,
    and precision agriculture specifically focuses on the precise management of farm
    inputs. Together, these advancements facilitate informed decision-making and optimised
    resource use [[2], [3]]. Digital agriculture encompasses a broad spectrum of technologies,
    including communication, information, and spatial analysis tools. These technologies
    enable farmers to efficiently plan, monitor, and manage both the operational and
    strategic aspects of their production systems. Beyond established technologies
    like field sensors [[4], [5], [6]], orbital and UAV-embedded remote sensors [[7],
    [8], [9]], global positioning systems, telemetry, and automation [10], digital
    agriculture is also characterised by the integration of the Internet and connectivity
    in crops [11,12], cloud computing, big data, blockchain, and cryptography [[13],
    [14], [15]], as well as deep learning [[16], [17], [18]], the Internet of Things
    (IoT) [19], mobile applications, and digital platforms [20,21], and artificial
    intelligence [22]. These advancements not only support critical pre- and post-production
    decisions but also promote greater sustainability within production systems [[23],
    [24]], offering access to differentiated markets that benefit short food supply
    chains. The integration of DATs is critically aligned with global sustainability
    and food security goals, particularly under the European Green Deal and its ''Farm
    to Fork Strategy''. These initiatives aim for a radical transformation of the
    food system towards sustainability, setting ambitious targets for the reduction
    of chemical pesticides and fertilisers, and the expansion of organic farming by
    2030 [25]. DATs, encompassing innovations such as precision agriculture, remote
    sensing, and data analytics, are at the forefront of this transformation, offering
    pathways to harmonise economic profitability with environmental stewardship. These
    technologies enable precision resource application, efficient crop monitoring,
    and data-driven management, presenting significant advantages in optimising agricultural
    productivity and reducing ecological footprints [[2], [23], [26], [27]]. Multiple
    studies have analysed the adoption trends [[28], [29], [30]], the potential in
    improving the quality of life for rural populations [31], and the overall resources
    efficiency of the agri-food sector [32,33]. Researchers have extensively studied
    the holistic effect of DATs in the form of systematic process-based analyses [34,35],
    with the environmental footprint of the sector and the potential of DATs in reducing
    it being at the forefront of numerous studies [36,37]. The evidence supporting
    the transformative impact of DATs in agriculture is compelling, highlighting their
    role in enhancing yields, conserving resources, and mitigating environmental impacts.
    Such outcomes are vital for tackling the challenges of feeding a growing population
    while preserving natural resources and ecosystems. However, harnessing the full
    potential of DATs necessitates a comprehensive analysis of their benefits, catering
    to the informational needs of various stakeholders including policymakers, farmers,
    and the agricultural industry. Limited research has been done in combining the
    environmental and economic parameters associated with the adoption of DATs across
    the entire agricultural sector, with most existing studies either focusing on
    a single production system [38] or a single DAT applied in different agricultural
    cases [39]. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review covering both the
    economic and environmental benefits of DATs in a single manuscript, to facilitate
    decision-making processes, guiding the adoption and implementation of these technologies
    in line with the sustainability goals of the European Green Deal and the ''Farm
    to Fork Strategy''. The EU-funded QuantiFarm project [40], which is dedicated
    to evaluating the impact of digital agricultural solutions, actively promotes
    the integration of DATs to increase sustainability and competitiveness. As part
    of this project, an integrative literature review was conducted to gain a comprehensive
    understanding of the existing percentage and numerical benefits associated with
    the economic and environmental aspects of DATs in crop production. Consequently,
    the primary aim of this paper was to provide a thorough understanding of the economic
    and environmental impacts of DATs in crop production. Methodology The approach
    followed was grounded on an integrative review of the existing literature, as
    described by [41]. Integrative reviews offer new perspectives, both theoretical
    and conceptual, through the synthesis and/or critique of existing research [42].
    By using this approach, the outcomes contribute to research by providing a comprehensive
    perspective on the topic, while also systematically organising the existing knowledge
    base in a meaningful way. To guide and clarify the integrative process, the general
    principles proposed by Tranfield et al. [43] are followed, which include (1) framing
    the objective, (2) executing the process, and (3) presenting the results [42].
    Framing the objective The overall aim of this review was to provide numerical
    evidence of the economic and environmental benefits of adopting DATs. By quantifying
    the benefits associated with each DAT, the aim is to encourage adoption of these
    technologies amongst farmers, improve their understanding of the benefits and
    consequently increase their willingness to adopt such innovations in crop production.
    Consequently, the paper''s primary objective was formulated by revisiting the
    core research questions: RQ1: What are the economic benefits of integrating DATs
    into crop production? RQ2: What environmental benefits arise from the adoption
    of DATs in crop production? Categorisation of DATs for crop farming systems To
    assess the predefined research questions and to ensure a well-structured search,
    searches were conducted using specific categories. The categorisation of the DATs
    of this paper was based on Van Evert et al. [44], which divided Precision Agricultural
    Technologies into 3 categories, Recording, Guidance and Reacting. For the purpose
    of this study, these categories have been further expanded to include the wider
    spectrum of DATs into the following five categories: Recording and Mapping Technologies
    (RMT) : Characterised by systems to monitor and map what exists in the crop environment
    (soil, crop, micro-climate), using yield and soil mapping, Real-Time Location
    Systems (RTLS) and monitoring mechanisms, these technologies create a bridge between
    real-time field data and actionable farming strategies [45]. By tracing diverse
    field metrics, they facilitate the development of detailed field blueprints, thereby
    guiding agricultural operations in efficient, targeted, and environmentally-friendly
    directions. Guidance / Controlled Traffic Farming (CTF) Technologies: These technologies
    stand as a testament to innovations addressing the adverse impact of random vehicle
    movement across fields [46]. By localising all vehicular movement to predetermined
    lanes, CTF combines productivity, sustainability, and profitability, ensuring
    soil preservation and a favourable environment for crop growth [47]. Variable
    Rate Technologies (VRT): VRT permits farmers to manage resources with precision.
    It paves the way for the customised distribution of fertilisers, insecticides,
    and irrigation, aligning with individual crop needs. This technology has the potential
    to mitigate the environmental footprint of farming practices while also bolstering
    resource management, crop yield, and profitability [48]. Robotic Systems or Smart
    Machines (RSSM): With a combination of Artificial Intelligence (AI), advanced
    Information and Communications Technology (ICT), Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication,
    RSSM mark the digital transformation of agriculture [49]. From drones to machine
    learning algorithms and robotic systems and vehicles, they represent the union
    of technology and agriculture, guiding the development of current and future agricultural
    paradigms. Farm Management Information Systems (FMIS): Evolving from basic record-keeping
    systems, today''s FMIS platforms and their resulting products, including Decision
    Support Systems (DSS) and Quality Management Systems (QMS), have evolved into
    sophisticated holistic platforms. Modern agricultural FMIS allow for automated
    data processing, by syncing data streams from numerous internet of things (IoT)
    components (such as sensing devices and cloud services), enabling data-oriented
    decisions and efficient resource management [50]. Fig. 1 illustrates the categories
    of DATs applied in the context of crop farming, which are derived from the pre-existing

    ‘Flow chart of the literature search strategy’. Identification of studies via
    databases Search Strategy The search for relevant literature was undertaken through
    Scopus and Web of Science, electronic databases known for their comprehensive
    coverage of scientific and academic publications [42,51,52]. The search strategy
    encompassed a range of keywords related to DATs, and the economic and environmental
    aspects of these technologies. Keyword combinations were structured to target
    specific DAT categories and their associated economic and environmental benefits.
    General Keywords: “agriculture”, “farming”, “crop production” DATs Categories
    Keywords: \"Farm Management Information System\", \"FMIS\", \"Decision Support
    System\", \"DSS\", \"Guidance”, \"Controlled Traffic Farming\", \"CTF\", \"Variable
    Rate Technologies\", \"VRT\", \"Recording Technologies\", \"Mapping Technologies\",
    \"Robotic Systems\", \"Smart Machines\". Economic Benefits Keywords: “yield increase”,
    “fertiliser saving”, “pesticide saving”, “herbicide saving”, “labour saving”,
    “fuel saving”, “efficiency improvement ”, “productivity enhancement”, “cost reduction”.
    Environmental Benefits Keywords: “greenhouse gas emissions”, “nitrous oxide”,
    “N2O”, “methane emissions”, “CH4”, “carbon footprint”, “groundwater quality”,
    “water quality”, “aquatic ecosystem”, “soil erosion”, “soil emissions”, “water
    runoff”, “environmental sustainability”. The conducted literature search resulted
    in a significant number of potential sources. In order to guarantee the incorporation
    of the most relevant and updated content, literature selection criteria and a
    multi-stage screening process was implemented. Literature Selection Criteria The
    formulation of the selection criteria was aimed at ensuring the inclusion of research
    that is relevant and rigorous. The following criteria were applied throughout
    the literature search: Relevance: The inclusion of articles depended on whether
    they addressed DATs within the context of crop systems, with a focus on their
    economic and environmental implications. Publication Date: A preference was given
    to literature published within the last decade (2013 to 2023) to ensure the incorporation
    of the most current information. Language: Inclusion of articles primarily in
    English, with consideration of articles in other languages if deemed highly relevant
    and if English translations were available. Multi-stage screening At this stage,
    a review of titles and abstracts of retrieved articles was conducted to evaluate
    their alignment with the research objectives and inclusion criteria. Subsequently,
    a comprehensive examination of the full texts of the selected articles was carried
    out. Studies that did not provide substantial information regarding the economic
    and environmental aspects of DATs in crop systems, particularly those lacking
    information on numerical and percentage-based benefits, were excluded. This decision
    was made in line with the primary aim of the review, which was to record scientific
    data for economic and environmental benefits as part of the QuantiFarm project
    to assist farmers in optimising their economic returns and environmental impact.
    Identification of EU project documentations via CORDIS Search Strategy The search
    for relevant EU projects was undertaken through CORDIS, the European Commission''s
    central repository for outcomes derived from projects financed by the EU''s framework
    programs. The following keywords were used to gather the projects related to the
    general context of our research. Keywords: “smart agriculture”, “precision farming”,
    “precision agriculture”, “smart farming”, “digital agriculture”, “digital farming”.
    In order to manage the large amount of results obtained from CORDIS, a thorough
    selection process was carried out. Selection Criteria The use of specific keywords
    allowed for the retrieval of relevant materials, resulting in a significant amount
    of projects and their documentation. All relevant files from CORDIS were downloaded
    for examination, with a specific focus on extracting quantitative insights into
    the efficacy of DATs in crop production within the EU context. The initial phase
    of the selection involved a thorough assessment to eliminate any documents that
    did not directly contribute to the objectives of our research. Multi-stage screening
    After an initial selection process based on predefined criteria in Section 2.3.1,
    a multi-stage screening approach was used to further refine the dataset and isolate
    project documentation that specifically addressed the quantitative benefits of
    DATs in crop production. A deeper analysis was conducted to extract documents
    containing specific references to percentages and numerical benefits associated
    with the implementation of DATs in crop production. This involved reviewing project
    descriptions, reports, and findings to identify key metrics and data points that
    illustrate the impact of DATs on crop production. Presentation of the results
    The presentation of the results is structured to offer a comprehensive overview
    of the economic and environmental impacts of DATs in crop production. Given the
    diverse nature of DATs and their varied applications in agriculture, the findings
    are organised into specific categories corresponding to the technology types identified
    in the methodology: RMT, CTF technologies, VRT, RSSM, and FMIS. For each category,
    a dual approach in presenting the results has been adopted: Quantitative Summary
    Tables: The number of peer-reviewed papers alongside the number of documents with
    empirical data from relevant EU projects are synthesised into summary tables.
    These tables provide a clear, quantified snapshot of the number of papers and
    documents associated with each DAT category, as well as specific benefits including
    yield increase, fertiliser savings, pesticide savings, water savings, labour/fuel/cost
    savings, and environmental benefits (Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, Table 4, Table
    5–6). Table 1. Number of References related to DAT Categories. DAT Categories

    28 Narrative Synthesis: Complementing the quantitative tables, a narrative synthesis
    followed to thoroughly examine these findings, presenting a coherent narrative
    that connects the various pieces of data. This narrative comprehensively examined
    all notable findings for each DAT category and each specific benefit derived from
    the literature and projects, presenting a comprehensive perspective on the advantages
    linked to DATs. It explained the mechanisms through which DATs deliver their advantages
    and the crop types that the DATs were implemented. Results From the screening
    process, a total of 160 references were selected, comprising 132 peer-reviewed
    papers and 28 documents with empirical data from relevant EU projects. These selections
    were based on their specific contributions to understanding the economic and environmental
    impacts of DATs. Table 1 below categorises these references according to their
    relevance to a DAT category and their provision of data on specific benefits.
    It is important to note that the total number of references included all sources
    that provided information relevant to one or more DAT categories. Some documents
    examine more than one DATs category, highlighting the interconnection and multifaceted
    benefits of DATs in agriculture. Analysing the table, it is evident that the information
    provided by scientific articles (136) are more than double that of the European
    projects (28). Delving into more detail, it is apparent that certain technologies
    are more extensively studied and analysed than others. For instance, the VRT category
    provided 48 peer-reviewed articles, ranking first among all categories. From this
    result, it can be asserted that this category is of fundamental importance in
    all those agricultural systems whose primary objective is to minimise the misuse
    of inputs, both for economic reasons and environmental concerns. For this reason
    most articles in this category referred to the variable rate application of agricultural
    inputs. Continuing with the analysis of peer-reviewed articles that garnered significant
    interest, the ''RMT'' category ranked second with 27 articles, followed by the
    ''RSSM'' category in third place with 23 articles. With regard to the results
    obtained by RMT, this was undoubtedly attributed to the strong presence in today''s
    market of high-performance GPS devices at reasonable costs. This DAT category
    encompasses several technologies widely adopted in Precision Agriculture and is
    essential for the proper management of all phases of agricultural management and
    production. Concerning robotic systems, the significant number of articles was
    probably due to the growing popularity of these technologies, thanks to the substantial
    investments currently being made in a sector that is growing not only in agriculture.
    Finally, the categories ''CTF'' and ''FMIS’ concluded the ranking with 20 and
    14 peer-reviewed articles, respectively. These categories, although used in agriculture
    for their effectiveness, may be considered less crucial than other technologies
    analysed, potentially playing a less fundamental role in scientific research.
    Regarding the ranking of data obtained from European projects (28), the first
    position was occupied by data derived from projects related to FMIS technologies.
    In this case, 13 specific valid data points for this technology were found. This
    situation demonstrated that the interest in the development of information systems
    is widely spread and finds space in the agricultural field as well. The second
    category with the highest number of data is \"RMT,\" which presented 7 European
    projects. The various technologies falling within this DAT were studied with growing
    interest. The reason is attributed to the fact that a correct management support
    system depends on accurate recording of georeferenced data. Finally, the last
    three categories, \"VRT,\" \"RSSM,\" and \"CTF Technologies,\" produced 3, 3,
    and 2 data obtained from European projects, respectively. Recording and mapping
    technologies (RMT) (inc. monitoring and mapping systems, real-time location systems
    (RTLS)) Table 2 below provides a detailed and quantified overview of the peer-reviewed
    papers and documents with empirical data from relevant EU projects associated
    with the RMT DAT category, detailing the specific benefits observed. These benefits
    include yield increase, fertiliser savings, pesticide savings, water savings,
    and savings in labour, fuel, and overall costs, as well as environmental benefits.

    reduction 8.6–17 % – CO2 emissions reductions – 5–20 % Yield Increase: RMT have
    been instrumental in driving yield increases across various agricultural sectors
    by enabling more informed and precise farm management decisions. Studies such
    as that by Paulius et al. [53] have shown yield increases in organic winter wheat
    grown under low soil performance conditions, with gains ranging from 9.7 % to
    13.34 %. Keller et al. [54] observed an 8 % to 12 % yield boost in winter wheat
    from site-specific weed control, illustrating the potential of targeted agricultural
    practices. Yield improvements were also reported by projects like the Added-Value
    Weeding Data use case of the IOF2020 project, confirming these findings. Through
    high-resolution camera data processing, this project achieved a 5 % increase in
    lettuce yield, optimising harvest timings and selective harvesting in organic
    vegetable farming (Added Value Weeding Data– [55]). Similarly, the Precision Crop
    Management project, utilising IoT sensors and agronomic models, mirrored these
    results with a 5 % increase in wheat yield and quality (Precision Crop Management–
    [56]). This is in line with the results reported by Munnaf et al. [57], where
    maize grain yield increases led to a gross margin increase of up to $92.67 per
    hectare. The Within-Field Management Zoning Baltics initiative, part of the IOF2020
    project, utilised hyperspectral imaging, IoT technologies, and AI-driven analytics
    to enhance crop health in potatoes and wheat. The project achieved substantial
    yield increases, ranging from 52.5 % to 62.6 % for potatoes and 7.5 % to 8.6 %
    for wheat, reinforcing the findings of Astanakulov et al. [58] who reported significant
    wheat yield increases from 4.46 t/ha to 6.24 t/ha using GPS-equipped combines
    (Within Field Management Zoning Baltics– [59]). Further evidence from Squeri et
    al. [60] and Haghverdi et al. [61] in viticulture and irrigation management, respectively,
    with yield increases up to 40 % and 32 %, solidifies the role of RMT in enhancing
    agricultural productivity. Fertiliser Savings: Advancements in RMT have substantially
    enhanced fertiliser efficiency. Basso et al. [62] found a 12 % reduction in nitrogen
    fertiliser use in wheat through spatially variable nitrogen fertilisation in Mediterranean
    environments. Argento et al. [63] reported a reduction in nitrogen leaching, greenhouse
    gas (GHG) emissions, and improved nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) by approximately
    10 % through site-specific nitrogen management in winter wheat, facilitated by
    remote sensing and soil data, with fertiliser application reduced by 5–40 %. Andújar
    et al. [64] demonstrated an up to 80 % reduction in fertiliser dosage for vineyard
    crops using aerial imagery and on-ground detection, compared to conventional applications.
    In greenhouse crops, Vakilian and Massah [65] achieved an 18 % decrease in nitrogen
    fertiliser consumption with a farmer-assistant robot. Medel-Jimenez et al. [35]
    who achieved input savings of 14 % using prescription maps and 23.9 % using sensors.
    Colaço and Bramley [66], Colaço and Molin [67] and Guerrero and Mouazen [68] also
    provide literature evidence of nitrogen application reduction, ranging from 1.6
    % to 82.0 % with proximal sensors and 6.0 % to 50.0 % with remote sensors. Empirical
    data align with these findings. The Precision Crop Management project within IOF2020,
    utilising IoT sensors and satellite data, achieved a 5 % reduction in nitrogen
    application (Precision Crop Management– [56]). The Within-Field Management Zoning
    Baltics use case of IOF2020 employed hyperspectral imaging and machine learning
    algorithms to precisely assess the nutritional demands of potato and wheat crops,
    leading to substantial fertiliser cost reductions of €229.5 to €323 per hectare
    for potatoes and €160 to €224 per hectare for wheat.(Within Field Management Zoning
    Baltics– [59]) The ''GaiaInFarm'' project under HORIZON 2020, using RMT and an
    FMIS for fruit cultivation, reported a remarkable 50 % to 70 % decrease in fertilisers
    usage (GAIA InFarm– [69]). This project utilised sensing stations, app technology,
    and DSS to enhance monitoring and decision-making processes. Pesticide savings:
    RMT have made significant strides in Plant Protection Products (PPP) savings across
    various agricultural practices, as evidenced by both empirical studies and real-world
    applications. In the realm of literature, Ørum et al. [70] demonstrated that utilising
    low-dose herbicides through precision application technologies can lead to cost
    reductions ranging from 20 % to 50 %. Laursen et al. [71] introduced a weed quantification
    algorithm for maize that significantly reduced herbicide use by 65 %. Yan et al.
    [72] explored a laser sensor-guided spray control system in greenhouses, achieving
    a reduction in spray volume by 29.3 % to 51.4 %.Castaldi et al. [73], obtained
    herbicide savings, based on application map, in the range of 14 % and 39.2 % compared
    to a uniform application. Gusev et al. [74] observed a 3.6 % reduction in PPP
    usage by implementing precision farming technologies. De Bortoli et al. [75] reported
    up to 50 % savings in product usage with the Structure from Linear Motion (SfLM)
    canopy profiling system for sprayer control. Tewari et al. [76] utilised sonar
    sensing in orchards, resulting in a 26 % reduction in PPP use. Complementing these
    findings, empirical data from projects like SDOP (Smart Detection of Pests) and
    the EIP-AGRI Focus Group further reinforce these findings. The SDOP project, using
    optical and acoustic sensors for pest detection, achieved a 20 % reduction in
    pesticide use by enabling precise and early pest identification, leading to more
    targeted applications (SDOP– [77]). The EIP-AGRI Focus Group''s work on precision
    fertilisation in fruit production anticipates reductions of 15–20 % in fungicide
    use for stone fruit and 20–30 % for pome fruit, specifically against powdery mildew
    [78]. Water savings: Although these systems need more investigation, RMTs contribute
    to the necessity of water conservation in agriculture.Millán et al. [79] implemented
    an automatic irrigation scheduling system in a hedgerow olive orchard, leveraging
    an algorithm that readjusted the water balance based on soil moisture sensor data,
    resulting in a 24 % reduction in water usage. Similarly, Zhe et al. [80] developed
    innovative irrigation scheduling software that uses model-predicted crop water
    stress to determine optimal irrigation timing and quantities, achieving water
    savings between 16 % and 35 %. These academic findings are mirrored in empirical
    data from the Precision Crop Management initiative. Utilising a combination of
    IoT sensors, satellite imagery, and drone technology, this initiative successfully
    reduced irrigation costs by 10 %, demonstrating effective water-saving strategies
    and efficient water resource management in wheat cultivation. This real-world
    application highlights the practical benefits and applicability of RMT in enhancing
    water conservation in agricultural practices (Precision Crop Management– [56]).
    Labour/Fuel/Cost savings: RMT in agriculture, encompassing a range of precision
    farming tools and methods, have demonstrated substantial efficiencies and cost
    savings across various aspects of farm management. Gusev et al. [74] explored
    the impact of precision farming technologies on production and economic indicators
    in agriculture organisations, identifying a significant 6.3 % reduction in fuel
    consumption. Concurrently, Strub et al. [81] observed a substantial cost reduction
    by transitioning from Vertical Shoot Positioning (VSP) to Mechanical Pruning (MP)
    training systems on steep slopes, achieving an overall cost reduction of 34 %
    and 46 %, respectively. This decrease was largely attributed to reduced machinery
    costs. Complementing these studies, empirical data from the IoF2020 EU-funded
    project provide real-world evidence of similar benefits. The Added-Value Weeding
    Data use case within IoF2020, utilising advanced vision systems, achieved a 5
    % reduction in machine running hours by optimising image collection and processing
    (Added Value Weeding Data– [55]). This improvement in efficiency was a direct
    result of enhanced image analysis capabilities, facilitating more precise weeding
    operations and reducing the need for extended machine usage. Furthermore, this
    approach led to a 5 % improvement in labour efficiency, demonstrating how refined
    image processing can aid in more accurate crop parameter calculation and enhance
    crop growth predictions, ultimately reducing the manual labour required for weeding
    and crop monitoring (Added Value Weeding Data– [55]). Additionally, the Precision
    Crop Management project within IoF2020, applying IoT-based sensing and advanced
    analytics, streamlined operations and achieved a 5 % reduction in labour duration
    (Precision Crop Management– [56]). This efficiency gain underscores the advantages
    of automated and efficient monitoring methods in saving time and optimising resource
    allocation, illustrating the practical impact of RMT in enhancing labour, fuel,
    and cost savings in the agricultural sector. Environmental Benefits: Environmental
    benefits derived from RMT have shown promising reductions in GHG emissions and
    energy use, contributing significantly to the mitigation of global warming potential
    (GWP). These technologies, particularly when integrated with precision agriculture
    practices, offer direct environmental benefits through the efficient use of resources
    and optimization of crop production processes. Medel-Jiménez et al. [82] quantified
    the environmental impacts of using optical crop sensors in winter wheat production,
    revealing an 8.6 % reduction in global warming potential, highlighting the efficacy
    of crop sensors in reducing the carbon footprint of agricultural operations. Further
    research by Medel-Jiménez et al. [35] underlined the potential of crop sensors
    in precision agriculture to cut global warming by 17 %, showcasing their vital
    role in combating climate change. Empirical evidence further supports these findings,
    with the implementation of solar-powered sensors and AI-driven precision farming
    leading to a 20 % drop in CO2 emissions (Solar Powered Field Sensors– [83]). This
    integration of renewable energy sources and advanced analytics into farming practices
    underscores the potential for significant environmental improvements. Moreover,
    the Precision Crop Management initiative within the IOF2020 EU-funded project
    leveraged IoT technology and data-driven decision-making to notably reduce its
    environmental impact, achieving a 10 % reduction in GHG emissions and a 5 % decrease
    in energy usage (Precision Crop Management– [56]). These outcomes reflect a strong
    commitment to environmentally sustainable wheat production practices, illustrating
    how modern agricultural technologies can lead to considerable environmental benefits.
    Guidance and controlled traffic farming (CTF) technologies Table 3 below provides
    a detailed and quantified overview of the peer-reviewed papers and documents with
    empirical data from relevant EU projects associated with the CTF DAT category,
    detailing the specific benefits observed. These benefits include yield increase,
    fertiliser savings, pesticide savings, water savings, and savings in labour, fuel,
    and overall costs, as well as environmental benefits. Table 3. Quantitative Benefits

    – Reduction in Chemical Runoff – 99.8 % GHG Emissions Reduction – 56 % Yield increase:
    CTF technologies have been consistently linked to yield increases in various crops,
    as evidenced by a range of studies. Hargreaves et al. [84] observed a 13 % increase
    in dry matter yield due to CTF practices. Galambošová et al. [85] reported that
    CTF could enhance yields by 35 % compared to multi-pass treatment and 9 % compared
    to single-pass treatment. In the context of onion production on sandy soils, Pedersen
    et al. [86] noted 19 % higher yields in CTF simulation plots. Hefner et al. [87]
    demonstrated significant yield increases in white cabbage, potato, and beetroot
    of 27 %, 70 %, and 42 %, respectively, associated with CTF. Additionally, Hussein
    et al. [88] found that CTF outperformed non-CTF practices with a 30 % higher grain
    yield in average rainfall seasons, and Zhang et al. [89] documented a 16.81 %
    increase in kiwifruit orchard yields using CTF technologies. The cumulative findings
    from these studies, including those by Misiewicz & Galambosova [90], indicate
    that CTF systems can increase yields by 10–15 %, depending on soil type and operation
    duration. These studies collectively demonstrate the advantages of CTF systems
    over traditional multi-pass or single-pass treatments. While empirical data specifically
    related to yield increases in CTF from field applications are not readily available,
    the consistency and range of improvements reported in academic studies across
    different crops and soil conditions strongly suggest the potential benefits of
    CTF in real-world agricultural scenarios. These benefits are primarily attributed
    to optimised planting and application processes, reduced soil compaction, and
    improved overall agronomic efficiency. Fertiliser savings: CTF technologies have
    been identified as effective means for reducing fertiliser usage and costs, a
    benefit supported by both academic research and empirical data. Balafoutis et
    al. [38] noted that in CTF systems, where fertilisers are not applied to permanent
    wheel tracks, there is a potential cost reduction of 10–15 % for narrow-spaced
    crops. Similarly, Soto et al. [37] reported a 15 % reduction in fertiliser usage
    through the implementation of CTF. Gasso et al. [91] observed a broader range
    of fertiliser reduction, between 1 % and 26 %, depending on the context. Tullberg
    [92] highlighted an even more significant aspect of CTF: an enhancement in nitrogen
    efficiency by 40–80 %, attributed to reduced soil compaction and improved soil
    biological activity. Hussein et al. [88] corroborated this, demonstrating a 1.75
    times increase in NUE in CTF compared to non-CTF systems. Furthermore, Misiewicz
    & Galambosova [90] found a 15 % improvement in fertiliser uptake due to less soil
    compaction in CTF systems. Pesticide savings: CTF technologies have shown promising
    results in reducing PPP usage, as evidenced by both academic research and empirical
    data. Masters et al. [93] discovered that the combination of controlled traffic
    and early-banded application in sugarcane farming led to a significant 32–42 %
    decrease in herbicide losses in runoff, which also contributed to lower input
    costs. Gasso et al. [91] reported a reduction in pesticide use ranging from 1
    % to 26 % in their studies. Furthermore, Tullberg [92] noted that CTF could potentially
    reduce herbicide requirements by 25 %, attributed mainly to more timely and efficient
    spraying facilitated by permanent traffic lanes. Complementing these academic
    findings, empirical data from innovations like the Wingssprayer, a patented crop
    spraying technology from the Netherlands, reinforces the fertiliser savings potential
    in practical applications. The Wingssprayer enables farmers to reduce the use
    of expensive spraying chemicals by up to 30 % (Wingssprayer– [94]), showcasing
    the efficiency and environmental benefits of such technologies. This reduction
    is achieved by focusing on eliminating weeds, insects, and fungi within crops
    while preventing chemical waste into the surrounding environment. Water savings:
    CTF technologies have been identified as key contributors to water savings in
    agricultural practices, as supported by various studies and empirical data. Bellvert
    et al. [95] observed water reductions of 13.0 % and 9.0 % for different crops
    through precision irrigation in CTF systems, highlighting the efficiency of water
    use. Hussein et al. [88] linked CTF to a 65 % increase in rainfall-use efficiency,
    leading to reduced runoff and water conservation. This aligns with yield increases,
    making CTF not only environmentally beneficial but also cost-effective. Gasso
    et al. [91], Thomsen et al. [96], and Macák et al. [97] conducted comprehensive
    reviews and research, consistently finding that CTF resulted in reductions in
    water runoff by 28 % to 42 % compared to conventional farming practices. These
    reductions contribute significantly to soil and water conservation by mitigating
    erosion and preserving water quality. Empirical evidence supporting these findings
    comes from the implementation of the Wingssprayer. This technology, while primarily
    focused on reducing spray agent use, also significantly decreases water usage
    by 30 % to 50 % due to its efficient spraying method. The Wingssprayer technology,
    through its unique aerodynamic advantages, enhances the efficiency of spraying,
    thus contributing to substantial water savings (Wingssprayer– [94]). Labour/ Fuel/
    Cost savings: CTF technologies have demonstrated substantial benefits in reducing
    labour, fuel, and overall operational costs, as shown by various studies and empirical
    data. Soto et al. [37] highlighted a 4 % reduction in fuel consumption and a 6.42
    % labour saving, attributing these improvements to reduced operator error and
    fatigue. Nørremark et al. [98] focused on optimising in-field route planning for
    grain harvest operations, revealing a 7 % reduction in fuel consumption through
    strategic route planning and operational adjustments. Cheein et al. [99] discussed
    how service units used in precision agriculture, including path tracking controllers
    for articulated service units, can significantly improve the efficiency of processes
    like harvesting and agrochemical application. In their study, time associated
    with harvesting olives was improved by approximately 42–45 %. Pedersen et al.
    [100] found that auto-steer systems enhance planting and fertiliser application
    efficiency, leading to cost benefits for seed, fertiliser, and tractor fuel. Hameed
    et al. [101] reported that the interpretation of data in specific algorithms could
    reduce tractor usage costs by 2–14 %. Gasso et al. [91] showed a 23 % reduction
    in fuel use, while Tullberg [92] found that CTF significantly reduces tractor
    fuel requirements by 40 % and 70 % in different tillage scenarios compared to
    conventional tillage. Misiewicz & Galambosova [90] noted a 25 % fuel saving due
    to reduced soil compaction in CTF systems. Empirical data further supports these
    findings. The Wingssprayer does not require extra fuel to pump spray fluid, leading
    to additional fuel savings of 10 to 20 litres per hour (Wingssprayer– [94]). The
    EIP-AGRI Focus Group on \"Mainstreaming Precision Farming\" confirmed that CTF
    reduces fuel consumption by 10 % by avoiding overlapping [78]. Additionally, the
    SIEUSOIL project documented that optimised routes for farm machinery, developed
    using specific algorithms, were about 14 % shorter than reference trajectories,
    with turning costs reduced by up to 16 % [102]. Environmental Benefits: CTF technologies
    have been identified as a pivotal strategy for reducing GHG emissions and enhancing
    environmental stewardship in agriculture. These technologies facilitate significant
    reductions in fuel consumption, soil emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O), methane
    (CH4), and water runoff, underscoring their role in promoting sustainable agricultural
    practices. Research conducted by Gasso et al. [91] revealed that the adoption
    of CTF could result in fuel savings of up to 23 %, showcasing the system''s efficiency
    in energy use. Additionally, the study highlighted a reduction in soil emissions
    of nitrous oxide by 21–45 %, which plays a crucial role in diminishing the overall
    GHG emissions associated with farming activities. Moreover, studies from Australia
    and China, as documented by Macák et al. [97], demonstrated that CTF could significantly
    reduce water runoff by 28–42 %, thereby preventing soil erosion and protecting
    aquatic ecosystems from sedimentation. A comparative Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)
    conducted by Gasso et al. [103] between CTF and random traffic farming (RTF) in
    Denmark illustrated CTF''s broad environmental advantages. The study showed reductions
    across various impact categories, including human toxicity by 3–15 %, eco-toxicity
    by 11–138 %, terrestrial eutrophication by 29 %, and climate change by 50 %, underscoring
    CTF''s potential to mitigate environmental impacts through precise management
    and reduction of agricultural inputs. Empirical data further supports these findings.
    The Wingssprayer technology, a component of CTF, has been demonstrated to prevent
    waste effectively, reducing runoff to the ground by 56 %. This innovation ensures
    minimal spray agent penetration into the groundwater, aligning with environmental
    protection goals. Furthermore, the Wingssprayer''s design, which blocks wind,
    has led to a drastic reduction in drift by 99.8 %, substantially minimising the
    risk of chemical dispersal into non-target areas (Wingssprayer– [94]). Reacting
    or variable rate technologies (VRT) Table 4 below provides a detailed and quantified
    overview of the peer-reviewed papers and documents with empirical data from relevant
    EU projects associated with the VRT DAT category, detailing the specific benefits
    observed. These benefits include yield increase, fertiliser savings, pesticide
    savings, water savings, and savings in labour, fuel, and overall costs, as well
    as environmental benefits. Table 4. Quantitative Benefits of VRT DAT Category

    Reduction in NO emissions 42 % – Yield increase: VRT have demonstrated significant
    yield increases across a variety of crops, showcasing the efficiency and effectiveness
    of precision agriculture. In studies focusing on irrigation, Sui et al. [104]
    and Balafoutis et al. [38] noted a 2.8 % increase in soybean yield and 0.8 % in
    corn yield through VRI management. The potential of VRT extends to diverse crops,
    as evidenced by Samborski et al. [105] and Amaral et al. [106] who conducted studies
    on VRNA, achieving yield increases of 6.25 % and 30 %, respectively. Guerrero
    et al. [107] observed an increase in yields of up to 10 %, Bergerman et al. [108]
    recorded a 33 % increase in corn yield with VRF,) and Esau et al. [109] reported
    a 31 % higher yield in wild blueberries using a variable-rate (VR) fungicide application.
    Casa et al. [110] highlighted a 28 % increase in silage maize yields through the
    use of variable rate nitrogen fertilisation (VRNF) driven by multi-temporal clustering
    of archives guided by satellite data. In the context of vineyards, Sanchez et
    al. [111] achieved a 10 % increase in yield through VRI, while Nadav & Schweitzer
    [112] implemented Variable Rate Drip Irrigation (VRDI), resulting in a 17 % increase
    in total yield. Further supporting the benefits of VRT, Vellidis et al. [113]
    introduced a dynamic control system for VRI, leading to an 8.4 % increase in yields.
    Additionally, Munnaf et al. [114] utilised a multi-sensor data fusion approach
    for site-specific seeding in potato production, achieving a substantial 21.94
    % increase in yield. Corassa et al. [115] found that reducing seeding rates by
    18 % did not compromise yields, offering tangible economic benefits in terms of
    seed savings. Empirical support for these findings comes from the Within Field
    Management Zoning project of IOF2020, where a 2 % increase in yield was achieved
    through precise field management and customised VR application strategies (Within
    Field Management Zoning– [59]). This project exemplifies the practical application
    of VRT in enhancing crop productivity. Fertiliser savings: VRT has proven to be
    a significant tool in reducing fertiliser usage across a variety of agricultural
    settings, as evidenced by numerous studies. Basso et al. [62] observed a 12 %
    reduction in nitrogen fertiliser use in Mediterranean environments, demonstrating
    the efficiency of spatially variable application. Similarly, Li et al. [116] reduced
    N fertiliser use by 11 % without decreasing grain yield, while Guerrero et al.
    [107] reported a substantial reduction of 19 % in nitrogen consumption through
    site-specific management in cereal crops. Argento et al. [63] also achieved notable
    decreases in nitrogen leaching and GHG emissions, along with improved NUE, reducing
    fertiliser application by 5–40 % in winter wheat. Liakos et al. [117] showed substantial
    savings in a Greek apple orchard, with 59.6 % and 63.4 % less fertiliser used
    compared to uniform application using VRA based on yield-based mathematical formulae.
    Further research by Colaço and Molin [67] led to a 13.1 % increase in citrus yield
    alongside a significant reduction in potassium and nitrogen applications. Chattha
    et al. [118] developed a VR spreader for wild blueberries, achieving fertiliser
    savings between 30 % and 50 %. Van Evert et al. [44] applied VRT in olive production,
    cutting down the use of various fertilisers by substantial margins, including
    a 31 % reduction in potassium fertilisers and 59 % in phosphate. Saleem et al.
    [119] highlighted a 50 % reduction in fertiliser use in wild blueberries, also
    noting decreased water contamination. Soto et al. [37] emphasised the broader
    impacts of precision agriculture, achieving an 8 % reduction in nitrogen fertiliser
    use. Stamatiadis et al. [120] reduced total nitrogen application by 38 % in winter
    wheat, translating to a 58 % increase in NUE. Additionally, Vatsanidou et al.
    [121] successfully implemented nitrogen VRT in a pear orchard, leading to a 56
    % and 50 % reduction in nitrogen fertiliser usage. Empirical data aligns with
    these academic findings. The Within Field Management Zoning project of IOF2020
    demonstrated a 22–30 % reduction in nitrogen fertiliser use, highlighting the
    potential of VRT for efficient resource utilisation and cost savings (Within Field
    Management Zoning– [59]). The TARGIS-VRA system, adaptable to traditional agricultural
    machines, achieved 25 % to 30 % fertiliser conservation, confirming that precision
    farming can be both effective and economically viable, even for smaller scale
    operations (TARGIS-VRA– [122]). Pesticide savings: Recent advancements in VRT
    have shown significant potential for PPP savings in agriculture. These technologies,
    leveraging sensor-based systems and precision agriculture techniques, have been
    effective in various studies and empirical data. Tackenberg et al. [123] achieved
    an 8 % fungicide savings in winter wheat using sensor-based variable-rate application
    (VRA). Zhang et al. [124] reported a 51.9 % reduction in spray volume for air-assisted
    spraying based on real-time disease spot identification. Román et al. [125] implemented
    geostatistical optimisation for PPP application, resulting in approximately 25
    % savings. Gil et al. [126] and Campos et al. [127] conducted vineyard experiments,
    achieving PPP reductions of 21.9 % and over 40 %, respectively, through VR spraying.
    Dammer [128] reported annual herbicide savings ranging from 30 % to 43 % in carrot
    fields using a real-time VRA system. Keller et al. [54] explored site-specific
    weed control, achieving herbicide savings of 40 %, 29 %, and 71 % for different
    types of weeds, with overall savings of 36 %. Maghsoudi et al. [129] and Nackley
    et al. [130] focused on precision spraying in pistachio orchards and deciduous
    perennial crops, respectively, reducing PPP use by about 34.5 % and between 67
    and 80 %. Rodriguez-Lizana et al. [131] and Li et al. [132] explored variable
    PPP application in olive groves and orchards, with savings ranging from 21 % to
    38 % and a 46 % reduction in spraying volume. Kempenaar et al. [133] and Fessler
    et al. [134] showed average savings of about 25 % and 54 %, respectively. Fountas
    et al. [50], Ørum et al. [70] and Gonzalez-de-Soto et al. [135] reported substantial
    herbicide savings of 20–50 % and 66 %, respectively, through precision herbicide
    application technologies. Additionally, Tewari et al. [136] developed a microcontroller-based
    herbicide applicator for field crops, which utilised a camera and MATLAB software
    for image processing to control herbicide application. Their system resulted in
    an average of 50 % savings in herbicide usage, with a weeding efficiency of 90
    %. Vorotnikova et al. [137] evaluated a web-based expert system for precision
    fungicide management in strawberry production. The Strawberry Advisory System
    (SAS) led to significant reductions in crop losses (23.7 % for anthracnose and
    20 % for Botrytis) and decreased fungicide use by 47 % for anthracnose and 49
    % for Botrytis, while increasing profit by 41.6 % and 16.8 %, respectively. Zhu
    et al. [80] tested a laser-guided VR air-assisted sprayer in commercial nurseries,
    achieving reductions in spray volume and chemicals by 60 % to 77.6 %, depending
    on the pest and nursery. Xun et al. [138] demonstrated that advanced spraying
    systems in apple orchards could reduce PPP application by 12 % to 43 % compared
    to conventional methods. Empirical evidence from various projects supports these
    findings. The Within-Field Management Zoning Use Case within the IOF2020 project
    achieved substantial PPP savings by utilising advanced sensor-based technologies,
    resulting in a 43 % to 53 % reduction in haulm killing herbicide use, a 17 % decrease
    in weed control herbicide, and a 20 % to 25 % reduction in overall herbicide and
    fungicide use (Within-Field Management Zoning– [59]). The TOAS initiative developed
    intelligent drones for weed detection in crops, leading to a 15–35 % decrease
    in herbicide use (TOAS - [139]). The Smart Sprayer OPTIMA, part of the EU Horizon
    2020 research project, achieved a 23 % reduction in PPP usage [78]. The EU LIFE
    project Life-F3 demonstrated a reduction of spray volume by 17.65 % [78], and
    the Agricultural Mechanization Unit of the Polytechnical University of Catalonia''s
    OPTIMA smart sprayer achieved a 23 % reduction in pesticide use [78]. Additional
    trials with high-end Fede sprayers in Poland saved 25 % of water and PPPs [78].
    A project involving Rota Unica utilised sensors and cameras in orchards, leading
    to a 20 % to 30 % reduction in PPP use [78]. Water savings: Recent developments
    in VRT have demonstrated their potential in significantly reducing water consumption
    in agricultural practices. These technologies, which employ precision agriculture
    techniques and sensor-based systems, have been validated through various studies
    and empirical data. Balafoutis et al. [38] conducted computer simulations showing
    variable water savings up to 26 % with optimised specific zone control in centre-pivot
    irrigation. Vellidis et al. [140] introduced a soil moisture sensor-based irrigation
    scheduling system, achieving water savings ranging from 7.5 % to 19 %. Sui et
    al. [104] revealed that VRI systems can reduce irrigation water use by 8–20 %
    for soybeans and 25 % for corn. Sanchez et al. [111] reported up to a 17 % gain
    in water use efficiency with VRI in California vineyards. Nadav & Schweitzer [112]
    implemented VRDI in vineyards, achieving a 20 % reduction in water consumption.
    Modina et al. [141] successfully applied VRI in vineyards and orchards, reducing
    water usage by 20 % in vineyards and 50 % in pear orchards. Campos et al. [127]
    developed canopy vigour maps using UAVs for site-specific management, resulting
    in over 40 % water savings during vineyard spraying. Bohman et al. [142] evaluated
    variable rate nitrogen (VRN) and reduced irrigation management in potato production,
    achieving a 15 % reduction in irrigation water use. Martello et al. [143] assessed
    a VRI system integrated with soil sensor technologies, indicating improvements
    in irrigation water use efficiency with increases of 35 % and 10 % in different
    zones. Ortuani et al. [144] and Turker et al. [145] explored the feasibility of
    VRI, reporting water savings of 18 % and a range from 2.56 % to 7.3 %, respectively.
    Mendes et al. [146] presented a feasibility study of a fuzzy VRI control system,
    achieving a 27 % reduction in irrigation water use. Gutiérrez et al. [147] developed
    an automated irrigation system optimising water use for agricultural crops, achieving
    water savings of up to 90 % compared with traditional irrigation practices. Empirical
    data further supports these findings. The HydroSense project applied VRI in cotton
    fields in Greece, showing 5 to 34 % savings in water consumption [148]. The EU
    LIFE project Life-F3 demonstrated a reduction in spray volume of plant protection
    products and water by 17.65 %, maintaining effective coverage [78]. Labour/Fuel/Cost
    savings: Recent studies have highlighted the economic benefits of Reacting or
    VRT in agriculture. These technologies optimise resource usage, leading to significant
    reductions in input costs, fuel consumption, and labour hours, thereby enhancing
    farm profitability and environmental sustainability. Velandia et al. [140] found
    that VR systems could reduce the cost of sowing by 3.5 to 22.9€/ha, which includes
    avoiding the need for replanting. Kuang et al. [149] compared traditional and
    VR approaches in Danish spring barley and observed an increase in lime consumption
    but also an increase in yield, resulting in a net profit of €3.61/ha for the VR
    approach. Daccache et al. [150] estimated the benefits to lettuce growers in Cambridge,
    UK, from using VRI to be around 30 €/ha, especially in over-irrigated areas in
    humid climates. Liakos et al. [117],based on yield-based mathematical formulas,
    implemented variable-rate fertilisation (VRF) resulting in cost savings ranging
    from 2.3 % to 7.6 % Soto et al. [37] noted that VRN Technology led to a 2.8 %
    reduction in fuel consumption, illustrating the economic and environmental benefits
    of precision agriculture. Manandhar et al. [151] conducted a techno-economic evaluation
    of a laser-guided VR spraying system in apple orchards, finding a significant
    reduction in labour hours and fuel consumption by approximately 28 %. Empirical
    data from projects like the EU LIFE project Life-F3 further supports these findings.
    The project demonstrated savings by using FEDE''s Smartomizer H3O, which improved
    work performance by around 26 % (from 2.25 ha/h to 3 ha/h) due to increased tractor
    speed while maintaining similar fuel consumption. This led to both labour cost
    savings and a 26 % reduction in fuel use. The cost savings from using the Smartomizer
    H3O compared to the reference sprayer were approximately 18.28 % [78]. Additionally,
    a high-end Fede sprayer tested in an apple field resulted in a 29 % reduction
    in spraying hours, a 25 % cost reduction, and a 29 % fuel saving. The cost-benefit
    analysis for this situation indicated financial savings of around 760 € per hectare
    per year [78]. Environmental Benefits: VRT have emerged as significant contributors
    to environmental sustainability in agriculture by offering precise application
    of inputs like water, fertilisers, and pesticides, thus enhancing resource efficiency.
    Studies have underscored the environmental benefits of VRT, particularly in reducing
    GHG emissions and optimising water use, marking a positive shift towards sustainable
    farming practices. Li et al. [116] demonstrated the environmental benefits of
    implementing a proximal sensor for VRNA achieving a 10 % reduction in soil N2O
    emissions,reduction in volatilization of NH3 by 23 % and last of all 16 % reduction
    in NO3 leaching.Bohman et al. [142] highlighted a 15 % reduction in GHG emissions
    through the implementation of VRN and Reduced Irrigation Management in potato
    production. El Chami et al. [152] demonstrated the superiority of precision irrigation
    systems over conventional methods by achieving a 22.6 % reduction in CO2 emissions
    and a 23.0 % decrease in water use. McCarthy et al. [153], Abalos et al. [154],
    and Balafoutis et al. [38] further supported these findings, with reductions in
    GHGs emissions by 15.2 %, a 42 % decrease in NO emissions, and a 17.2 % reduction
    in GHGs emissions, respectively. These studies collectively affirm the role of
    VRT in reducing the environmental footprint of agriculture by significantly cutting
    down on emissions and resource use. Empirical data further corroborates the environmental
    benefits of employing VRT in agricultural practices. A field test involving a
    high-end Fede sprayer equipped with crop sensing capabilities on an apple farm
    led to a 29 % reduction in GHG emissions, mirroring a similar decrease in fuel
    consumption [78]. Another practical application at an olive farm in Portugal utilised
    FEDE''s Smartomizer H3O, which not only improved work performance by 26 % but
    also achieved a 26 % decrease in GHG emissions. This reduction was accompanied
    by significant economic savings, moving from a cost of 332 €/ha per year to 271.35
    €/ha per year with the Smartomizer H3O, highlighting an 18.28 % cost-saving [78]

    – 48 % Yield increase: The studies conducted by Munnaf et al. [155] and Kitić
    et al. [156] on the use of sensors for site-specific silage seeding and real-time
    soil analysis using robotic systems have resulted in an increase in yield of 4.4
    % and 1.76 %, respectively. Regarding orchards, the robotic systems studied by
    Nagasaki et al. [157] for harvesting and by Rose & Bhattacharya [158] for precision
    forecasting have led to yield increases of 50 % and 15 %, respectively. In the
    case of the study conducted by Rose & Bhattacharya [158], a 10 % saving in used
    land was achieved, with a 20 % reduction in damaged fruit. These developments
    underscore the significant impact of advanced agricultural technologies on yield
    enhancement and operational efficiency. Fertiliser savings: The autonomous robotic
    systems for real-time soil analysis studied by Kitic et al. [156] allowed for
    a saving of 7.5 % in KAN fertiliser (Potassium, Ammonium, Nitrate). In the fruit
    cultivation field, the study conducted by Esau et al. [159] on the use of machine
    vision smart sprayers for targeted agrochemical distribution in wild blueberry
    fields resulted in a fertiliser saving ranging from 10 % to 12.6 %. Finally, the
    study conducted by Vakilian and Massah [65] on machine vision smart sprayers for
    targeted agrochemical distribution in wild blueberry fields achieved an 18 % saving
    in nitrogen fertiliser. These advancements are not only boosting productivity
    but also promoting sustainable agricultural practices by curbing unnecessary resource
    use. Pesticide savings: The integration of RSSM, incorporating AI, into modern
    agricultural practices has led to substantial PPP savings, highlighting significant
    strides towards sustainability. These technologies, through precise weed detection,
    spot application, and sensor fusion, have markedly reduced PPP usage, demonstrating
    both environmental and economic benefits. Gonzalez-de-Soto et al. [135] showcased
    an autonomous system achieving 66 % herbicide savings through precise weed detection
    and spraying. Pérez-Ruiz et al. [160] observed a 45 % reduction in applied spray
    volume with autonomous crop protection technologies. Zaman et al. [161] reported
    fungicide savings ranging from 9.9 % to 51.22 % with automated prototype VR sprayers
    in wild blueberry fields. Partel et al. [162] highlighted a 28 % reduction in
    spraying volume using sensor fusion and AI in smart tree crop sprayers. Oberti
    et al. [163] noted PPP use reductions between 65 % to 85 % with CROPS robots in
    grapevine spraying, while Biocca et al. [164] achieved a 43 % reduction in copper-based
    PPP use with the Rovitis 4.0 autonomous robot. Hussain et al. [165] demonstrated
    savings of 42 % and 43 % in spray liquid during weed and simulated diseased plant
    detection experiments with AI-based VR sprayers. Sanchez-Hermosilla et al. [166]
    observed herbicide savings of 34.39 % and 35.15 % across two seasons with leaf
    area estimation technologies. Rose & Bhattacharya [158] achieved a 90 % reduction
    in fungicide usage with autonomous UVC disease treatment robots in the soft fruit
    sector. Tewari et al. [76] reported a 26 % reduction in PPP usage with sonar sensing-based
    automatic spraying technology. Berenstein & Edan [167] achieved a 45 % reduction
    in PPP material with an automatic adjustable spraying device. Empirical data further
    supports these advancements. The Smart Orchard Spray Application, integrated within
    IOF2020, recommended precise treatment parameters based on crop conditions, leading
    to a 13 % to 26 % decrease in PPPs and spray volume (Smart Orchard Treatment–
    [168]). The EU-FP7 project CROPS developed a precision spraying robot for viniculture,
    achieving an 84 % pesticide reduction in greenhouse tests and demonstrating the
    potential for up to 90 % reduction with selective spraying [169]. The EU-funded
    Asterix project''s autonomous robot, AX-1, applies eco-friendly biopesticides
    sparingly, reducing weed killer usage by up to 95 % and suggesting a yield increase
    up to 45 % in parsley root [170]. Water savings: The integration of RSSM, powered
    by AI, into agricultural practices has demonstrated significant potential for
    water savings. These advanced technologies, by enabling precise irrigation management,
    have shown to markedly improve water use efficiency in agriculture. Viani et al.
    [171] introduced a scalable smart irrigation system for precision agriculture,
    utilising a fuzzy logic strategy integrated with a distributed monitoring system
    based on wireless sensor network technology. This system, experimentally validated
    in an apple orchard, enhanced irrigation efficiency by more than 40 % compared
    to standard irrigation methods. The approach led to more accurate water exploitation,
    stabilising soil moisture levels, which positively impacted crop health and product
    quality. Dobbs et al. [172] explored sensor-based automatic irrigation, achieving
    water savings of up to 75 %. Their study highlighted the effectiveness of using
    automatic rain sensors, soil water sensors (SWS), and evapotranspiration controllers
    (ET) over traditional automatic timer treatments. These technologies applied significantly
    less water, with reductions ranging from 17 to 49 %, 64–75 %, and 66–70 %, respectively,
    demonstrating substantial improvements in water conservation. Empirical evidence
    further supports the water-saving capabilities of these technologies. Within the
    IOF2020 project, the Smart Orchard Spray Application showcased water savings between
    14 % to 26 % through strategic application and IoT-driven precision. By optimising
    spray parameters and targeting specific areas, this innovation significantly reduced
    water consumption in orchard irrigation, contributing to efficient resource utilisation
    and sustainable agricultural practices (Smart Orchard Treatment– [168]). Labour/Fuel/Cost
    savings: The deployment of robotics in precision agriculture, specifically in
    arable farming, vineyards, and soft fruit sectors, has evidenced considerable
    economic benefits, marking a significant advancement towards efficient resource
    management. Lampridi et al. [173] conducted an economic evaluation of robotics
    in precision arable farming, finding that a 5 % increase in field efficiency of
    robots led to a 17 % reduction in total cost per unit of time, and a labour saving
    of 37.75 % by reducing the required units from four to three. Pérez-Ruíz et al.
    [174] demonstrated a 57.5 % reduction in labour time with a co-robotic intra-row
    weed control system, significantly decreasing the time spent on hand hoeing in
    the intra-row region. On the contrary, Bochtis et al. [175] demonstrated that
    the use of deterministic behaviour robotic systems (AMS) in path planning reduced
    non-working time from 10.7 % to 32.4 % in inter- and intra-row operations in orchards.
    Lopez-Castro et al. [176] developed a Vineyard Terrestrial Robot, achieving a
    97 % reduction in labour required for fumigation processes, while Bechar et al.
    [177] highlighted that agricultural robots could reduce manual labour required
    in vineyard mechanisation by 45–62 %. Tziolas et al. [178] revealed fuel savings
    between 22.15 % and 49.14 % through the use of Collaborative Robots in Greek viticulture.
    Rose & Bhattacharya [158] noted substantial labour reductions in the soft fruit
    sector, with packhouse labour down by 30 % and farm labour by 40 %, attributing
    additional savings to logistic support robots. Empirical data further underscores
    these advancements. The Smart Orchard Spray Application, integrating IoT-enabled
    airblast atomizing sprayers, achieved a 55 % reduction in fuel consumption, equating
    to €517 in fuel savings per hectare annually (Smart Orchard Treatment– [168]).
    This system optimises crop protection efficiency in cherry, apple, and almond
    production, minimising environmental impacts while enhancing cost control and
    decision-making. Additionally, the EU-FP7 project CROPS aims to develop modular,
    adaptable robotic systems that promise to reduce harvest costs by 40 %, showcasing
    the potential of intelligent tools in agriculture [169]. Environmental Benefits:
    RSSM, incorporating AI showcased remarkable environmental benefits, particularly
    in the reduction of green missions and PPP use. EIP-AGRI Focus Group reported
    a 26 % decrease in GHG emissions alongside a 17.65 % reduction in PPP usage. Furthermore,
    the same study noted a significant 29.3 % reduction in CO2, CH4, and NO2 emissions
    per sprayer per year, highlighting the potential of smart technologies to mitigate
    environmental impact in agricultural practices [78]. Empirical evidence supports
    these findings, with the Smart Orchard Spray Application within the IOF2020 initiative
    demonstrating a substantial 22 % to 39 % reduction in GHG emissions. This achievement
    was facilitated by the adoption of precise, IoT-enabled smart sprayers that optimise
    PPP application, focusing treatment on specific zones to minimise unnecessary
    usage and thereby reduce emissions. This approach not only enhances environmental
    sustainability in orchard farming but also results in a 48 % reduction in spray
    drift, further contributing to the conservation of surrounding ecosystems and
    reducing the potential for environmental contamination (Smart Orchard Treatment
    - [168]; Smart Orchard Spray Application - [179]). Farm management information
    systems (FMIS) Table 6 below provides a detailed and quantified overview of the
    peer-reviewed papers and documents with empirical data from relevant EU projects
    associated with the FMIS DAT category, detailing the specific benefits observed.
    These benefits include yield increase, fertiliser savings, pesticide savings,
    water savings, and savings in labour, fuel, and overall costs, as well as environmental
    benefits. Table 6. Quantitative Benefits of FMIS DAT Category from Peer-Reviewed

    & Disease risk – 20 % Yield increase: FMIS has led to notable yield increases
    across various agricultural sectors by harnessing the power of IoT, data analytics,
    and precision agriculture techniques. Sapkota et al. [180], demonstrated how the
    application of the DSS Nutrient Expert® enabled farmers to implement site-specific
    nutrient management (SSNM) for wheat. This adoption resulted in a 14 % increase
    in yield and 9 % increase in biomass compared to conventional farming practices.
    Cui et al. [181] conducted field trials across China, utilising a decision-support
    program that resulted in an average yield increase of 10.8 % to 11.5 % for major
    crops such as maize, rice, and wheat. Karydas et al. [182] further demonstrated
    the economic benefits of PreFer services in Greece, where 33 farmers experienced
    significant yield improvements up to 15 % across 1864 hectares of rice, maize,
    cotton, and wheat cultivation. Empirical evidence from the IoF2020 EU-funded project
    has significantly demonstrated the benefits of IoT-driven monitoring and precision
    control across various agricultural domains. The \"Fresh Table Grapes Chain\"
    use case has shown a notable improvement in the quality and yield of organic table
    grapes, with a 10 % increase in grape size and a 5 % enhancement in sugar content
    (Fresh Table Grapes Chain– [183]). Similarly, the \"Soya Protein Management\"
    initiative capitalised on sensor-driven technologies and a DSS to enhance soybean
    protein quality by 5 % and increase overall yield by the same margin, thanks to
    precise irrigation management and tailored seed density applications. In the realm
    of potato production, the \"Data-Driven Potato Production\" initiative utilised
    IoT data analytics and advisory systems to facilitate a 10 % increase in product
    quality, thereby boosting yield through informed decision-making processes (Data-driven
    Potato Farming– [184]). The \"Chain-Integrated Greenhouse Production\" use case,
    which implemented IoT-based DSS and data amalgamation, achieved a significant
    rise in crop harvested per square metre per year, ranging between 6.9 % and 8.3
    %, specifically in greenhouse tomato cultivation (Chain Integrated Greenhouse
    Production - [185]). Furthermore, the \"Automated Olive Chain'''' demonstrated
    how a comprehensive IoT infrastructure could effectively monitor and adjust irrigation
    and fertilisation, culminating in a 10 % increase in yield per hectare (Automated
    Olive Chain - [186]). The AREAS (Agriculture Remote Aerial Sensing) project, leveraging
    remote sensing and machine learning, provided timely decision-making data that
    led to a 10 % yield increase (AREAS - [187]). Lastly, TeamDev''s Agricolus DSS,
    a cloud application designed for precision agriculture, utilised NDVI analysis
    to predict the occurrence and spread of pests, thereby aiding in quick disease
    management and potentially safeguarding yields [188]. Fertiliser savings: Integrating
    FMIS into agricultural practices has led to significant fertiliser savings, demonstrating
    the power of technology in enhancing resource use efficiency and sustainability.
    The research conducted by Cui et al. [181] across China''s major agro-ecological
    zones employed a robust decision-support program, which resulted in nitrogen application
    reductions by 14.7 % to 18.1 %. Gallardo et al. [189] explored the FERTIRRIGERE
    V2.11 DSS for optimising fertigation management in drip-irrigated tomatoes in
    Italy, achieving a 46 % average reduction in nitrogen application while maintaining
    production and quality standards. Li et al. [190] reported a 40 % decrease in
    chemical fertiliser use through a systematic water-saving management system based
    on the IoT, and Cheng et al. [191] introduced a surrogate model-assisted multiobjective
    algorithmic framework for precision agriculture, demonstrating a 37 % reduction
    in nitrogen application. These improvements not only contribute to cost reduction
    but also align with environmentally sustainable practices. Empirical evidence
    from various initiatives underscores the impact of FMIS on fertiliser savings.
    The \"Fresh Table Grapes Chain\" within the IoF2020 EU-funded project demonstrated
    a reduction in fertiliser usage by 15 % per kilogram of grapes annually, illustrating
    the system''s effectiveness in promoting resource efficiency and eco-friendly
    agricultural practices (Fresh Table Grapes Chain - [183]). Similarly, the \"Soya
    Protein Management\" initiative realised a substantial 10 % decrease in fertiliser
    use through the implementation of advanced sensor-based technologies and precision
    farming practices. This reduction signifies a notable advancement towards sustainable
    agriculture, facilitated by informed decision-making based on sensor data (Soya
    Protein Management - [192]). Furthermore, the \"Big Wine Optimization\" project
    achieved significant fertiliser cost savings of 15 %, translating to 13€ per hectare.
    This initiative leveraged data analytics to optimise soil fertility and vine health,
    thereby streamlining fertiliser applications and promoting cost efficiency alongside
    sustainable viticulture practices (Big Wine Optimisation - [193]). In the \"Data-Driven
    Potato Production\" use case of the IoF2020 project, the integration of IoT technology
    and satellite data resulted in fertiliser cost savings ranging from 5 % to 15
    %, alongside a remarkable 15 % improvement in NUE. This optimisation of resource
    allocation underscores the benefits of precise farming practices (Data-driven
    Potato Farming - [184]). The \"Automated Olive Chain\" utilised IoT-based monitoring
    and tailored recommendations to achieve a significant 10 % decrease in fertiliser
    use. This approach guided farmers in precise and efficient fertiliser application,
    enhancing sustainability and reducing costs (Automated Olive Chain - [186]). GAIA
    InFarm, powered by GAIAtrons IoT devices, offers a holistic smart farming solution
    that significantly cuts fertiliser usage by 50–70 %, supporting small farmers
    in optimising farming practices for better yields and environmental conservation
    (GAIA InFarm - [69]). Lastly, the Agricolus DSS developed by TeamDev provides
    a cloud-based precision farming system that aids farmers and agronomists in reducing
    over-fertilisation by 12–22 %, showcasing the application''s utility in enhancing
    agronomic decisions [188]. The EU''s Horizon 2020 program, IoF2020, facilitated
    the adoption of smart solutions among potato farmers in Poland, Cyprus, and Ukraine.
    These solutions, spanning irrigation, pest management, and fertilisation, make
    strategic use of telemetry IoT stations, satellite data, and tailored scientific
    models based on regional geographical characteristics. The GAIA sense smart farming
    solution drives data-driven potato predictions, integrating advanced technologies
    like IoT, Big Data, Earth Observation, context-based decision support, and machine
    learning.The GAIA sense solution is enhanced with FIWARE-powered data exchange
    mechanisms, promoting interoperability and openness between systems. The impact
    of this technology includes a 15 % improvement in NUE (Data-driven Potato Production
    - [194]) Pesticide savings: Research and empirical evidence have highlighted the
    effectiveness of these technologies in optimising PPP application, leading to
    significant savings and environmental benefits. Ørum et al. [70] emphasised the
    economic efficiency of utilising low-dose herbicides, with potential cost reductions
    ranging from 20 % to 50 %. Li et al. [190] observed a 61.67 % decrease in PPP
    use in strawberry cultivation with a systematic water-saving management system
    based on the IoT, which also resulted in a 32.48 % reduction in PPP costs. Román
    et al. [125] reported about 25 % in PPP savings from precise, map-based variable-dose
    treatments in vineyards, showcasing the advantages of DSS in disease management.
    Crop Protection Online (CPO), a DSS described by Kudsk et al. [195], integrates
    decision algorithms and a herbicide dose model to optimise herbicide choice and
    dosage, achieving substantial herbicide reductions (about 60 % measured as the
    Treatment Frequency Index (TFI)) in spring barley through field experiments in
    Denmark. This demonstrates that decision support can significantly contribute
    to sustainable weed management. Empirical evidence from the IoF2020 EU-funded
    project further underscores the impact of FMIS. The \"Fresh Table Grapes Chain\"
    use case illustrated a 6 % decrease in PPP application per kilogram of grapes
    annually, leveraging innovative IoT technologies for sustainable pest management
    (Fresh Table Grapes Chain - [183]). The \"Digital Ecosystem Utilisation\" use
    case utilised sensor-based data and predictive analytics to monitor environmental
    conditions correlated with pest occurrence, leading to a significant 5 % to 10
    % decrease in the usage of PPPs (Digital Ecosystem Utilisation - [196]). The \"Big
    Wine Optimisation\" initiative realised a substantial 15 % reduction in PPP costs,
    equating to savings of 120€ per hectare by leveraging predictive analytics (Big
    Wine Optimisation - [193]). The \"Data-Driven Potato Production\" use case effectively
    lowered PPP costs by 10 % up to 15 %, showcasing efficient pest management strategies
    (Data-driven Potato Farming - [184]). Employing weather forecasts and fertigation
    models within the \"Chain-Integrated Greenhouse Production\" use case under the
    IOF2020 project resulted in a 5.3 % decrease in PPP use, fostering environmentally
    conscious practices (Chain Integrated Greenhouse Production - [185]). The Horizon
    2020 program''s support for smart solutions in potato farming has facilitated
    a 15 % reduction in PPP consumption by integrating telemetric IoT stations, satellite
    data, and scientific models (Data-driven Potato Production - [194]). Water savings:
    Research has demonstrated the impact of these systems on water conservation. The
    integration of IoT for water-saving management in strawberry cultivation reported
    by Li et al. [190] resulted in a 128 % improvement in water use efficiency. Tsirogiannis
    et al. [197] showed that a participatory DSS for irrigation management in wine
    grapevines led to improved crop water productivity (WPC) by 20–44 %. Mirás-Avalos
    et al. [198] introduced the Irrigation-Advisor for vegetable crops, achieving
    a 42.1 % reduction in water use. Fotia et al. [199] indicated water savings of
    up to 13 % in olive cultivation, and Cayuela et al. [200] demonstrated how FMIS
    could reduce water use by 20 % in oranges and tomatoes with controlled deficit
    irrigation strategies. Cheng et al. [191] reported a 44 % reduction in water consumption
    through precision agriculture management. Buono et al. [201] found that a DSS
    for kiwifruit farming saved 20–25 % of water, and Tamirat and Pedersen [202] highlighted
    water-saving benefits ranging from 10 % to 50 % in orchards. Empirical evidence
    from the IoF2020 EU-funded project further supports these findings. The \"Fresh
    Table Grapes Chain\" use case achieved a 20 % reduction in irrigation water usage
    annually by employing IoT-enabled precision control (Fresh Table Grapes Chain
    - [183]). The \"Digital Ecosystem Utilisation\" use case optimised irrigation
    schedules through sensor data, leading to a 5 % to 10 % reduction in water consumption
    (Digital Ecosystem Utilisation - [196]). The \"Soya Protein Management\" initiative
    reduced irrigation costs by 10 % (Soya Protein Management - [192]), while the
    \"Big Wine Optimisation\" project saw a 10 % reduction in water consumption (Big
    Wine Optimisation - [193]). The \"Data-Driven Potato Production\" use case accomplished
    a 25 % reduction in water consumption (Data-driven Potato Farming - [184]), and
    the \"Chain-Integrated Greenhouse Production\" use case curtailed water usage
    by 4.3 % to 5.6 % (Chain Integrated Greenhouse Production - [185]). The \"Automated
    Olive Chain\" facilitated a 15 % reduction in water consumption through intelligent
    water management (Automated Olive Chain - [186]). GAIA InFarm, with its IoT-driven
    solution, slashes irrigation water usage by up to 25 % (GAIA InFarm - [69]). The
    FIGARO project estimates that its DSS can save 20–60 % of irrigation water ([203].),
    and SMARTAGRIFOOD2′s irrigation advice application helps farmers reduce irrigation
    costs by up to 30 % [204]. Lastly, the Agricolus DSS supports decisions leading
    to a 20 % reduction in water stress for crops [188]. Labour/Fuel/Cost savings:
    FMIS, including DSS and QMS, have demonstrated considerable benefits in terms
    of labour, fuel, and cost savings across the agricultural sector. These systems
    optimise farm operations, leading to enhanced productivity and efficiency while
    significantly reducing operational costs. Karydas et al. [182] showcased the economic
    benefits of PreFer, an FMIS offering site-specific prescription maps for fertilisation.
    Farmers utilising PreFer reported yield increases up to 15 % and input cost reductions
    up to 20 %, highlighting the system''s effectiveness in simplifying fertilisation
    planning and application processes. Empirical evidence further corroborates the
    advantages of FMIS and related technologies. The \"Fresh Table Grapes Chain\"
    within the IoF2020 EU-funded project optimized operations, leading to a 15 % reduction
    in labour hours per kilogram of grapes harvested annually and a 20 % decrease
    in irrigation costs per year (Fresh Table Grapes Chain - [183]). The \"Digital
    Ecosystem Utilisation\" use case leveraged IoT devices and data analytics to streamline
    farm management practices, reducing the need for physical field visits by 20 %
    and achieving a 10 % cost reduction per kilogram input (Digital Ecosystem Utilisation
    - [196]; Digital Ecosystem Utilisation - [205]).In soybean cultivation, the \"Soya
    Protein Management\" initiative employed advanced sensor technologies and a tailored
    DSS, resulting in a 5 % reduction in production costs and work time (Soya Protein
    Management - [192]). The \"Big Wine Optimisation\" use case utilised tractor-mounted
    camera systems and multispectral imagery to achieve a 5 % reduction in treatment
    frequency, indicating significant labour savings (Big Wine Optimisation - [193]).
    Furthermore, the \"Data-Driven Potato Production\" use case demonstrated reductions
    in irrigation costs by 5 % to 25 % and total inputs costs by 18.6 %, highlighting
    the efficiency of IoT stations and satellite information in potato cultivation
    (Data-driven Potato Farming - [184]; Data-driven Potato Production - [194]). The
    \"Chain-Integrated Greenhouse Production\" project achieved a 5.2 % reduction
    in crop cultivation expenses through innovative IoT technologies and robust data
    analysis (Chain Integrated Greenhouse Production - [185]).The \"Automated Olive
    Chain\" optimised processes, reducing labor time by 10 % per kilogram produced
    and production costs by 15 %, demonstrating the impact of IoT-powered analytics
    and streamlined automation on operational efficiency (Automated Olive Chain -
    [186]). TeamDev''s development of the Agricolus DSS aims to support farmers and
    agronomists in making informed decisions, leading to an increase in farm productivity
    by 5–10 % and cost savings of 504€ per hectare, potentially saving farms an average
    of 10,000€ [188]. Environmental Benefits: FMIS, including DSS and QMS, present
    direct environmental benefits, notably in reducing GHG emissions and enhancing
    sustainability in agricultural practices. Barradas et al. [206] discussed the
    DSS-FS fertigation simulator, designed to optimise irrigation and fertigation
    systems, increasing their environmental sustainability. This system, as reported
    by users, boosts production significantly while saving 20–30 % in input factors
    and energy, illustrating the positive impact of FMIS on environmental sustainability.
    Empirical evidence further supports the environmental benefits of FMIS. The Big
    Wine Optimisation initiative, by installing electricity metres and optimising
    power usage within cellars and wine production areas, achieved a 10 % reduction
    in energy consumption. This was realised through meticulous monitoring, control,
    and optimisation of resource consumption, enhancing operational efficiency while
    reducing environmental impact (Big Wine Optimisation - [193]). The Chain-Integrated
    Greenhouse Production use case within the IOF2020 project improved energy efficiency
    by 2.7 % to 4.8 % and reduced water contamination by 5.3 %, mitigating adverse
    ecological effects associated with intensive greenhouse farming (Chain Integrated
    Greenhouse Production - [185]). The Automated Olive Chain, by integrating IoT
    technologies, managed energy consumption across operations, resulting in a 15
    % reduction. This system provided farmers with actionable insights, enabling them
    to optimise energy usage and contribute to a more sustainable farming environment
    (Automated Olive Chain - [186]). The Agricolus DSS, developed by TeamDev, offers
    a cloud application to support farmers and agronomists in making informed agronomic
    decisions. This project claims to mitigate the carbon footprint by 15 %, thereby
    reducing environmental impacts and disease risk by 20 % for issues like Olive
    Fruit Fly and Phytophthora [188]. Discussion Recording and mapping technologies
    (RMT) (inc. monitoring systems, real-time location systems (RTLS)) In this category,
    34 articles were identified, of which 27 were peer-reviewed articles, and 7 were
    attributed to European projects. This category of DATs is of fundamental relevance
    in the context of Precision Agriculture, and the quantity of data obtained demonstrates
    it. Among the numerous peer-reviewed articles, the most evident benefits were
    attributed to savings and increased efficiency in fertiliser use, with the identification
    of 8 valid studies. Among these, Andújar et al. [64] achieved the most remarkable
    result, managing an 80 % reduction in fertiliser doses applied in a vineyard through
    the use of aerial imagery and ground detection, optimising input usage without
    compromising crop yield. Additional benefits of RMT were found in further studies.
    Squeri et al. [60] achieved a 40 % yield increase in viticulture, thanks to vegetative
    indices based on prescription maps obtained from satellite images. Based on data
    from recordings and mappings, Laursen et al. [71] introduced a weed quantification
    algorithm for maize that significantly reduced herbicide use by 65 %, with positive
    environmental and economic impacts. The use of recording systems was also studied
    by Millan et al. [79], managing to use soil moisture sensors to reduce water usage
    by 24 %. Finally, Medel-Jiménez et al. [35] highlighted the potential of crop
    sensors in precision agriculture to reduce global warming by −17.04 %, compared
    to a conventional agricultural management scheme. Regarding European projects
    relevant to the investigation, once again, the most significant data is attributed
    to fertiliser savings. In particular, the ''GaiaInFarm'' project under HORIZON
    2020, using RMT and an FMIS application for fruit cultivation, was able to achieve
    a decrease in fertiliser usage between 50 % and 70 %. It should be noted that
    the project utilised sensing stations, app technology, and Decision Support Systems
    (DSS) to enhance monitoring and decision-making processes. Based on what has emerged,
    it can be stated that the proper use of these technologies is capable of bringing
    concrete benefits, such as the use of a lower quantity of fertilisers. Furthermore,
    the widespread availability of images and data (both satellite and non-satellite),
    if correctly interpreted, translates into an economic benefit that contributes
    to higher farmer''s profits. Guidance and controlled traffic farming (CTF) technologies
    Similarly to the previous category, this category has also provided a significant
    number of articles, totalling 20, while the number of projects was the lowest
    among all the technologies analysed, only 2. The most significant results in terms
    of benefits were found in the field of fertiliser and fuel use and savings. The
    study that stands out the most for the quality of the results achieved is the
    one conducted by Tullberg in 2014. The study stated that CTF systems can improve
    soil biological activity due to reduced compaction. This also leads to an improvement
    in Nitrogen Use Efficiency (NUE) between 40 % and 80 %, resulting in a lower demand
    for fertilisers [92]. The study also attributed to CTF a reduction in fuel consumption
    between 40 % and 70 % during all soil cultivation operations, making this technology
    less impactful in terms of consumption and sustainability [92]. Additional benefits
    were found in the study conducted by Hefner et al. [87] regarding the increase
    in yields of white cabbage, potatoes, and beetroots, which reached increases of
    27 %, 70 %, and 42 %, respectively, thanks to the use of CTF. The benefits of
    this technology were also highlighted in the study by Hussein et al. [88], which
    reported a 175 % increase in NUE and a 65 % increase in rainfall-use efficiency
    due to reduced soil compaction. The use of CTF has also demonstrated the ability
    to reduce herbicide requirements by 25 % [92] and decrease soil emissions of nitrous
    oxide (21–45 %), as demonstrated by Gasso et al. [91]. Regarding European projects,
    the best result was achieved in terms of drift reduction. Specifically, the \"Wingssprayer\"
    project was able to achieve a 99.8 % reduction in drift, minimising the risk of
    chemical dispersal into non-target areas (Wingssprayer - [94]). In light of the
    analysis, it is evident that crop management through CTF technologies is crucial
    to reduce the amount of fertilisers used and optimise the quality of operations
    performed. Furthermore, what has been highlighted is indispensable within a cropping
    system that can be defined as technological and sustainable. Therefore, these
    technologies must be further developed and adopted on a large scale. Reacting
    or variable rate technologies (VRT) This category has encountered the highest
    number of relevant peer-reviewed articles (52), while only 3 European projects
    have addressed the topic. Certainly, within a cropping system aiming to be efficient,
    sustainable, and technologically accurate, this technology is vital to reduce
    any kind of waste, whether it be inputs or economic resources. This technology
    has also proven to generate the most significant environmental benefit, precisely
    due to its ability to reduce the quantity of PPPs used during crop operations.
    Thanks to the wealth of data obtained, it has been possible to attribute the main
    benefits to two categories, namely PPP savings and water savings. Regarding PPP
    use, two studies have proven highly valid, with encouraging results: the study
    conducted by Tewari et al. [136] led to the creation of a system capable of achieving
    a 50 % savings in herbicide use, with a weeding efficiency of 90 %. Similarly,
    Zhu et al.''s [80] study allowed for a reduction in pesticide volume between 60
    % and 77.6 %. The best water management was found in the study conducted by Modina
    et al. [141], where the use of a Variable Rate Technology (VRT) irrigation system
    allowed for savings of 20 % and 50 % respectively for a vineyard and a pear orchard.
    In addition to these, other studies have highlighted the benefits of variable-rate
    technologies. The use of variable-rate fertilisation allowed Bergerman et al.
    [108] to record a 33 % increase in wheat yield compared to conventional fertilisation.
    Regarding fertiliser consumption, Van Evert et al. [44] were able to achieve a
    significant reduction in potassium-based fertiliser of 31 % and a reduction in
    phosphate consumption of 59 %. All these benefits cannot be classified solely
    as fertiliser savings but must also be considered as economic savings and more
    sustainable agricultural management. Finally, although the number of European
    projects in this field was not satisfactory, the \"Life-F3″ project, using a high-end
    Fede sprayer tested in an apple field, resulted in a 29 % reduction in spraying
    hours, a 25 % cost reduction, and a 29 % fuel saving (which translates into a
    decrease in greenhouse gas emissions by 29 %). The cost-benefit analysis for this
    situation indicated financial savings of around €760 per hectare per year [78].
    In light of the knowledge gained, it can be said that the wise application of
    VRT has the potential to produce significant environmental benefits. The amount
    of PPPs saved through these operations should not be underestimated, as it contributes
    significantly to both pollution mitigation and economic savings. This underlines
    the importance of adopting precision farming practices, not only for environmental
    sustainability but also for the economic efficiency they bring to farming operations.
    Robotic systems or smart machines (RSSM) (inc. artificial intelligence (AI)) Within
    this category, it was possible to identify 23 peer-reviewed articles and 3 European
    projects. The results from various research studies and European projects focusing
    on RSSM have demonstrated a significant positive impact, primarily emphasising
    savings in PPPs and water. The experiment conducted by Oberti et al. [163], using
    the \"CROPS\" robot, led to a reduction in vineyard PPP usage between 65 % and
    85 %. A slightly higher result is reported by Rose & Bhattacharya [158], achieving
    a 90 % reduction in fungicide usage with autonomous UVC disease treatment robots
    in the soft fruit sector. Regarding water conservation, Dobbs et al. [172] explored
    sensor-based automatic irrigation, achieving water savings of up to 75 %. Their
    study highlighted the effectiveness of using automatic rain sensors, SWS, and
    ET compared to traditional automatic timer systems. Furthermore, the research
    and projects developed have significantly contributed to reducing the required
    labour and have led to appreciable environmental benefits. Lopez-Castro et al.
    [176] developed a Vineyard Terrestrial Robot, resulting in a 97 % reduction in
    labour required for fumigation processes. From the point of view of yield increase,
    not many studies have been found, apart from the one carried out by Nagasaki et
    al. [157] who found a 50 % increase in yield by using a robotic harvesting system
    in an orchard. Additionally, the Smart Orchard Spray application within the IOF2020
    initiative demonstrated a substantial 22 % to 39 % reduction in GHG emissions
    (Smart Orchard Spray Application - [179]). In summary, the analysis of the RSSM
    category reveals a positive impact in agricultural sectors. The data on which
    the study is based highlights significant savings both in PPPs and in water usage.
    The highlighted examples underscore the importance of such technologies. Farm
    management information systems (FMIS) The conducted research has yielded a substantial
    amount of data, both concerning peer-reviewed articles (14) and, especially, European
    projects (13). The lower presence of peer-reviewed articles might be attributed
    to the fact that many companies and farmers do not consider this technology crucial
    for better crop management, likely because they prefer to invest in technologies
    with a more significant impact on their operations, such as VRT or guidance systems.
    As for the analysis of data obtained from European projects, it is noteworthy
    that data from projects related to FMIS rank first. This is evidently due to the
    fact that these technologies intersect with the realms of data management and
    data reception, elements that currently find ample space within startups and new
    computing projects. Among the many studies and projects analysed, those that have
    sparked the most interest cover a range of topics, from fertiliser savings to
    improved work efficiency. For instance, the DSS explored by Gallardo et al. [189]
    was able to reduce nitrogen application by 46 % through a fertigation system.
    In the same context, the \"GAIA InFarm\" project enabled a reduction in fertiliser
    use by 50 % to 70 %, supporting small farmers in optimising farming practices
    for better yields and environmental conservation. From a water management perspective,
    Tsirogiannis et al. [197] demonstrated that a participatory DSS for irrigation
    management in wine grapevines led to improved crop water productivity (WPC) by
    20–44 %. Regarding the savings of PPPs, Li et al. [190] observed a 61.67 % decrease
    in PPP use in strawberry cultivation with a systematic water-saving management
    system based on the IoT, which also resulted in a 32.48 % reduction in PPP costs.
    In economic terms, European projects have shown the most interest in study. The
    \"Big Wine Optimisation\" initiative achieved a substantial 15 % reduction in
    PPP costs, equivalent to savings of €120 per hectare, leveraging predictive analytics
    (Big Wine Optimisation - [193]). Similarly, the study conducted by Karydas et
    al. [182] demonstrated the economic benefits of PreFer, an FMIS offering site-specific
    prescription maps for fertilisation. Farmers utilising PreFer reported yield increases
    up to 15 % and input cost reductions up to 20 %, highlighting the system''s effectiveness
    in simplifying fertilisation planning and application processes. TeamDev''s development
    of the Agricolus DSS aims to support farmers and agronomists in making informed
    decisions, leading to an increase in farm productivity by 5–10 % and cost savings
    of €504 per hectare, potentially saving farms an average of €10,000 [188]. The
    same Agricolus DSS project also claims to be able to mitigate the carbon footprint
    by 15 %, demonstrating itself as a valuable environmental resource. The highlighted
    studies and projects mainly focus on the theme of fertiliser savings and all the
    related environmental and economic benefits. In conclusion, the research has provided
    significant contributions through peer-reviewed articles and European projects.
    The latter additionally underscore an increasing significance placed on data management
    and acquisition within the framework of contemporary computing environments. This
    growing emphasis reflects a recognition of the pivotal role that effective data
    handling plays in the success and advancement of technological initiatives. As
    these projects unfold, they not only contribute to specific objectives but also
    contribute to the broader understanding of the pivotal role data management holds
    in driving innovation and efficiency in diverse sectors. This trend aligns with
    the evolving landscape of technological advancements, where informed and strategic
    data usage is increasingly recognised as a key determinant of success in various
    fields. Conclusion This paper presented an integrative literature review on the
    economic and environmental impacts of DATs in crop production, emphasising their
    transformative potential across various categories, including RMT, CTF, VRT, RSSM,
    and FMIS. The analysis, grounded in peer-reviewed papers and documents with empirical
    data from relevant EU projects, demonstrates that DATs offer substantial economic
    benefits, such as yield increases, cost savings in fertilisers, pesticides, water,
    labour, and fuel, alongside notable environmental advantages by minimising the
    use of chemical inputs and optimising resource utilisation. Economically, DATs
    have demonstrated significant benefits across various agricultural practices,
    directly impacting yield outputs and input cost savings. Specifically, RMT has
    shown a potential yield increase ranging from 9.7 % to 62.6 % across different
    crops, highlighting their effectiveness in enhancing crop production efficiency.
    Furthermore, advancements in CTF technologies have been linked to yield increases
    of up to 70 %, demonstrating the positive impact of optimised field operations
    on crop productivity. In terms of input cost savings, VRT has led to substantial
    reductions in the use of fertilisers and pesticides, with studies reporting fertiliser
    savings of up to 59.6 % and pesticide savings ranging between 8 % and 80 %. These
    reductions not only lower the operational costs for farmers but also contribute
    to more targeted and efficient resource use. Additionally, RSSM have facilitated
    labour and fuel savings, with autonomous systems achieving a reduction in labour
    time by up to 97 % in specific tasks and fuel savings between 22.15 % and 49.14
    % through optimised machinery use. The implementation of FMIS has further enhanced
    economic efficiency by enabling better decision-making and resource allocation,
    leading to a reduction in water consumption by up to 60 % and a decrease in fertiliser
    use by 50–70 % in various case studies. These systems support the strategic management
    of agricultural inputs, optimising the application of water, fertilisers, and
    pesticides, thereby reducing excess use and minimising costs. From an environmental
    perspective, the analysis showcases DATs'' capacity to markedly improve resource
    use efficiency and reduce the ecological footprint of farming practices. Specifically,
    the deployment of RMT and VRT has been associated with substantial reductions
    in pesticide usage, ranging from 20 % to 50 %, and fertiliser savings up to 80
    %, mitigating soil and water pollution. CTF technologies contribute to soil structure
    preservation and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by optimising field operations
    and minimising unnecessary soil compaction. Furthermore, the adoption of RSSM
    and FMIS emphasises precision in application and resource management, leading
    to notable decreases in water usage by up to 40 % and enhancing the sustainability
    of water resources. The review has established that the economic and environmental
    benefits of DATs are closely linked, with gains in efficiency directly contributing
    to reduced environmental impacts. These benefits illustrate the pivotal role of
    DATs in facilitating a transition toward agricultural systems that are both more
    sustainable and economically viable. However, the maximisation of these benefits
    necessitates overcoming barriers to adoption, such as the need for improved integration
    across DAT platforms, the development of user-friendly interfaces for a diverse
    range of users, and the creation of supportive policy environments. To address
    these needs, future research should focus on developing holistic and interoperable
    DAT solutions that can seamlessly integrate into various agricultural practices.
    Additionally, creating policies that support the adoption and scaling of these
    technologies will be crucial for their widespread implementation. In summarising
    the main objectives and findings, it is clear that DATs offer valuable opportunities
    to enhance both the sustainability and efficiency of crop production, providing
    tangible economic benefits alongside significant contributions to environmental
    conservation. As the agricultural sector evolves to meet the challenges of the
    21st century, the strategic deployment of DATs will be essential in securing food
    security, economic resilience, and environmental sustainability. Importantly,
    the deployment of DATs aligns with and is essential for achieving the ambitious
    objectives of the European Green Deal and the Common Agricultural Policy, which
    seek to transform the EU into a fair and prosperous society with a modern, resource-efficient,
    and competitive economy. This review calls for continued innovation and the broader
    adoption of DATs, urging stakeholders to embrace digital agriculture''s potential
    in transforming farming into a more efficient, sustainable, and productive sector.

  description: This study aimed to assess the environmental effectiveness of vineyards
    utilising on-site weather stations integrated with a decision support system (DSS),
    and to identify the critical hotspots in smart farms that have already obtained
    integrated or organic certification. For this purpose, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)
    methodology was applied. The research comprised three smart farms employing on-site
    weather stations and a traditional farm without advanced technologies, which served
    as a benchmark. The analysis revealed variations in environmental footprints driven
    by differences in farm management practices and soil characteristics. The results
    highlighted that smart farms, in compliance with integrated or organic certifications,
    focus on reducing inputs such as agrochemicals or water consumption. However,
    these reductions could shift the environmental burden to other impacts, such as
    those related to machinery use, which remained the most critical aspect across
    all vineyards considered. In some smart farms, critical issues involve other aspects,
    such as irrigation and fertilisation. The lack of awareness about the potential
    environmental impacts of the adopted technical options could make smart farms
    more impactful than traditional farms. Interestingly, this study found that solely
    implementing advanced technologies could fall short of achieving ecological objectives.
    This study emphasises the significance of utilising LCA as a valuable tool to
    support farmers in making informed decisions while adopting technological strategies
    to achieve environmentally sustainable goals.

    • Employing weather stations alone is insufficient to achieve environmental goals.
    • LCA could allow the benefits accruing from smart technologies to be exploited.
    • The LCA could avoid burden shifting from one life cycle step to another. • Machine
    and electricity use was the major impact source in smart vineyards. Abstract This
    study aimed to assess the environmental effectiveness of vineyards utilising on-site
    weather stations integrated with a decision support system (DSS), and to identify
    the critical hotspots in smart farms that have already obtained integrated or

    stations and a traditional farm without advanced technologies, which served as

    highlighted that smart farms, in compliance with integrated or organic certifications,
    focus on reducing inputs such as agrochemicals or water consumption. However,
    these reductions could shift the environmental burden to other impacts, such as

    weather station 1. Introduction The negative environmental impact of agriculture
    is an old issue that remains a serious concern because it is responsible for 29
    % of the total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and utilises 70 % of all available
    freshwater (Rinaldi et al., 2016). Population growth and the consequent demand
    for food, as well as climate change, which puts the quality and amount of food
    available at risk (Alexandratos and Bruinsma, 2012; Maja and Ayano, 2021; Molotoks
    et al., 2021; Turi et al., 2014), could increase the environmental impacts of
    the agri-food sector. In this regard, the European Union, as part of “The European
    Green Deal” (EC, 2019), has introduced the “Farm to Fork Strategy”, aimed at creating
    a fairer, healthier and more environmentally friendly agri-food sector (EC, European
    Commission, 2020). Therefore, ecological transitions have become a priority for
    agricultural systems. In addition, the wine sector has become aware of the significant
    environmental impact of its activities. The effects of conventional viticulture
    on soil degradation and surface water pollution due to the intensive use and production
    of synthetic fertilisers and pesticides (Rugani et al., 2013; Villanueva-Rey et
    al., 2014), air pollution resulting from greenhouse gases and other emissions
    generated by agricultural machinery (Balafoutis et al., 2017; Renaud-Gentié et
    al., 2020), and excessive land and water consumption (Christ and Burritt, 2013)
    have also been demonstrated. Therefore, the need to measure the environmental
    sustainability of wine chains has increased in recent years. In this regard, different
    indicators and methods have been proposed and implemented, such as carbon and/or
    water footprints (Bonamente et al., 2016; Bosco et al., 2011; D''Ammaro et al.,
    2021a; Marras et al., 2015; Miglietta et al., 2018; Rinaldi et al., 2016; Rugani
    et al., 2013; Vázquez-Rowe et al., 2013), a set of indicators defined in the program
    VIVA established by the Italian Ministry of the Environment to promote the sustainability
    of the Italian wine sector (Borsato et al., 2020; D''Ammaro et al., 2021b; Lamastra
    et al., 2016), and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) (Casson et al., 2022; Fusi et al.,
    2014; Gazulla et al., 2010; Harb et al., 2021; Jourdaine et al., 2020; Masotti
    et al., 2022; Pattara et al., 2012; Roselli et al., 2020; Villanueva-Rey et al.,
    2014). The wine sector was the first to experience a significant ecologically
    oriented transformation, as the reputation of wine, more than that of other products,
    was closely tied to its origin and the climatic conditions of the relevant territories
    (terroir). Hence, operators consider climate change a deeply concerning issue,
    given its worldwide influence on wine production (Ollat et al., 2016; Santos et
    al., 2020). The environmentally sound turn is also dictated by increasing pressure
    from customers, whose purchasing choices tend to increasingly favour farms sensitive
    to environmental issues (Vecchio et al., 2023). Another reason that makes the
    ecological transition the right way for wine operators is the opportunity to expand
    their businesses by entering food and wine tourism. Garibaldi (2023) highlights
    that cellars and vineyards are the most interesting tourist places, as shown by
    numerous Italian vineyards being part of wine tourism itineraries. In addition,
    in the Sardinian region, which is considered a good destination for any wine enthusiasm,
    tourism is a profitable business for farms involved that generates 7–10 % of their
    turnover. As sustainability is a driver of choice for travellers attracted by
    these experiences, winegrowers interested in joining these tourist circuits must
    demonstrate their commitment to environmental protection by investing in ecological
    certifications and innovative technologies aimed at reducing the impact of their
    activities on the environment (Festa et al., 2023). The transition from conventional
    to integrated, organic, or biodynamic farming is considered an appropriate approach
    to reduce the negative impacts of viticulture (Borsato et al., 2020; Masotti et
    al., 2022; Notarnicola et al., 2017; Renaud-Gentié et al., 2020; Rouault et al.,
    2016; Volanti et al., 2022). In this regard, the European standards for integrated
    and organic agriculture principally focus on reducing synthetic fertilisers and
    pesticides but do not consider other aspects, such as GHG emissions. Accordingly,
    organic farms may not necessarily have better environmental performance than conventional
    farms (Renaud-Gentié et al., 2020; Rouault et al., 2016; Rugani et al., 2013;
    Venkat, 2012). Thus, other strategies are needed to fully achieve environmental
    sustainability. Smart technologies are considered a very promising solution for
    achieving environmental and economic efficiency in agricultural activities (Lieder
    and Schröter-Schlaack, 2021). As a result, a shift towards “smart farming” methods
    is taking place. The implementation of new technologies, such as global positioning
    systems (GPS) (Balafoutis et al., 2017), satellite and airborne remote sensing
    (Sassu et al., 2021), geographic information systems (GIS) (Ozdemir et al., 2017),
    robotics (Pradel et al., 2022), Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, drones,
    and artificial intelligence (Dantas et al., 2021; Drath and Horch, 2014), has
    enabled farmers to monitor field conditions and make strategic decisions for the
    whole farm or even a single plant (Khan et al., 2022; Martinho and Guine, 2021).
    Considering that successful farming depends on the monitoring of meteorological
    conditions, the application of wireless sensor networks (WSN), frameworks, and
    IoT platforms to detect various parameters such as soil temperature and moisture,
    air temperature and humidity, rainfall, and wind conditions has rapidly increased
    (Ebiesuwa et al., 2022; Nachankar et al., 2018; Prabu et al., 2021). These IoT-enabled
    networks can automate numerous farm activities through decision support systems
    (DSS) (Rinaldi and He, 2014). Therefore, in agriculture, it is becoming more common
    to use on-site weather stations integrated with a DSS, which allows growers to
    make well-informed decisions on several aspects of vineyard management, such as
    disease and pest control, irrigation scheduling, alerts on potential hazards such
    as freezing or hailstorms, control of the growth phase of grapevines, and grape
    ripening. Some studies have shown that the introduction of innovative technologies
    benefits farms by maximising yields and reducing impacts (Balafoutis et al., 2017;
    Canaj et al., 2021; Casson et al., 2022; Del Borghi et al., 2022; Núñez-Cárdenas
    et al., 2022). However, there are certain exceptions. Pradel et al. (2022) highlighted
    an overall increase in the environmental impact of a vineyard when weeding was
    carried out with robots rather than in a conventional manner. In addition, the
    use of technologies to reduce a given impact may increase the occurrence of different
    environmental harms (trade-offs). For example, in Australian vineyards, the reduction
    in water use achieved through the conversion from flood to drip irrigation increased
    GHG emissions owing to the increased energy consumption for water pressurisation
    (Longbottom and Petrie, 2015). Therefore, a multi-criteria assessment from the
    perspective of the life cycle stages of a product should be appropriate for exploiting
    all the environmental benefits offered by innovation, especially when the operations
    responsible for negative impacts are diverse, as in viticulture. Indeed, Bosco
    et al. (2011) and Vázquez-Rowe et al. (2012), in Italian and Spanish vineyards,
    respectively, indicated that fertiliser and pesticide production were the primary
    processes involved in global warming, whereas Rouault et al. (2016) and Balafoutis
    et al. (2017) observed that field energy was the leading cause of GHG emissions
    for French and Greek vineyards, respectively. The implementation of LCA has the
    potential to address these challenges and aid in the decision-making process for
    adopting technological solutions that optimise resource utilisation and minimise
    the environmental impact of crop production (Balafoutis et al., 2017; Canaj et
    al., 2021; Del Borghi et al., 2022; Núñez-Cárdenas et al., 2022; Pradel et al.,
    2022). This methodology, based on international standards (ISO, 2006), is widely
    used to assess environmental impacts and improve the environmental performance
    of goods and services throughout their life cycles (Finnveden et al., 2009; Guinée,
    2002; Tukker, 2000). It has also found various applications in the agricultural
    sector (Arzoumanidis et al., 2017; Notarnicola et al., 2017). In viticulture,
    LCA has primarily been employed to compare organic, biodynamic, and conventional
    farming methods (Masotti et al., 2022; Rouault et al., 2016; Rugani et al., 2013;
    Sinisterra-Solís et al., 2020; Villanueva-Rey et al., 2014; Volanti et al., 2022),
    and as an eco-design tool to evaluate the potential impact of precision agricultural
    strategies on vineyards (Rouault et al., 2020; Tziolas et al., 2023). Few studies
    have focused on utilising LCA to evaluate the environmental impacts of vineyards
    using advanced technologies (Balafoutis et al., 2017; Casson et al., 2022; Pradel
    et al., 2022), highlighting that awareness of the impacts linked to the farm management
    techniques adopted is fundamental to leverage all the benefits derived from the
    implementation of smart technologies. Therefore, it may be difficult to assert
    that smart farms have better environmental performance than traditional farms
    without this knowledge. Further studies are needed to deepen the knowledge of
    the opportunities offered to smart farms using the LCA methodology to highlight
    the environmental criticalities due to farm management and to obtain data on which
    to make informed choices to improve their environmental performance. This approach
    allows the benefits accrued from smart technologies to be exploited. Considering
    the usefulness of on-site weather stations integrated with DSS in vineyards, this
    study involved three smart farms employing this technology and, as a benchmark,
    a farm that did not utilise advanced technologies, with the following main objectives:
    1) Identifying critical hotspots from an environmental perspective that may persist
    in smart farms using remotely controlled on-site weather stations operating in
    the same geographical area under the same meteorological conditions that have
    already indicated their commitment to environmental protection through certification.
    2) testing the hypothesis that employing smart technologies alone enables farms
    to achieve environmental sustainability objectives fully. 2. Materials and methods
    2.1. Case studies LCA studies on vineyards in Northern Sardinia (Italy) were conducted
    using data from the year 2021. Three smart farms (Asm, Bsm and Csm) equipped with
    on-site weather stations including multiple sensor devices which could monitor
    wind speed, wind direction, air temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, solar
    radiation, air pressure, light, soil moisture, and leaf wetness were selected.
    The data acquired through the WSN are automatically sent to the cloud and readable
    by a smartphone so that the operator can monitor the trends of the parameters
    of interest, make quick decisions, and act effectively. Agronomic technicians
    supervised the selected vineyards to obtain reliable information and data. As
    a benchmark for smart farms, a traditional farm (Dtr) was considered, which did
    not use any technological devices to acquire information on weather forecasts
    and soil conditions but relied entirely on the multi-year experience of an agronomist
    and the regional meteorological service. The farms involved, whose characteristics
    are detailed in Table 1, were located in a limited geographical area characterised
    by a Mediterranean climate, with mild winters and hot, sunny summers tempered
    by sea breezes. The average values of temperature, humidity, and rainfall registered
    by the on-site weather stations owned by the farms during the grape growth cycle
    are listed in Table 1. The farms involved follow the path of sustainability guaranteed
    by environmental certification. Specifically, three farms obtained the SQNPI (Sistema
    di Qualità Nazionale di Produzione Integrata - National Quality System of Integrated
    Production) certification, established in Italy by Decree Law No. 4 (2011). This
    certification is granted to agricultural and agro-industrial production methods
    which comply with the technical standard of integrated production, an agri-food
    production system that uses production techniques aimed at minimising the use
    of synthetic chemicals and rationalising fertilisation in compliance with ecological,
    economic, and toxicological criteria. One of the farms (Csm) obtained the organic
    certification in compliance with the EU Regulation 2018/848. The farms involved
    in this study had areas ranging from approximately 3 ha to 40 ha, yielding 3400–10,000
    kg/ha of grapes. The production almost exclusively concerns grapes for certified
    Controlled and Guaranteed Denomination of Origin (DOCG), Controlled Denomination
    of Origin (DOC), and Typical Geographical Indication (IGT) wines. The production
    protocols for these certifications provide guidelines for grape cultivation techniques
    and yield limits. “Vermentino” is the predominantly grown grape cultivar in the
    farms involved; however, winegrowers manage all varieties cultivated under the
    same management schemes. The differences between farms were related to the soil
    texture, which ranged from predominantly sandy to mostly clayey, as well as the
    type of soil operations and the number of repetitions of each practice per year
    (Table 1). Fertilisation techniques range from fertigation and foliar fertilisation
    to buried fertilisation. Regarding irrigation, all farms adopted the drip irrigation
    system, with a variable (Farm Asm and Farm Bsm) or uniform rate (Farm Dtr). Unlike
    the others, Farm Csm did not include an irrigation phase. To identify the production
    steps that most influenced the environmental performance of each farm, the contributions
    to the various impact categories from soil operations (accounting for those linked
    to tillage, weed, and grass management), irrigation, fertilisation, and plant
    protection treatments were considered separately (Table 3). Regarding the phases
    related to fertilisation and plant protection treatments, the contributions to
    the considered impact categories of input products (manufacturing and use), diesel
    consumption for the use of machinery for spreading products, transport of products
    from the selling point to the farm, and product packaging were analysed in detail
    (Table 4). Table 1. Characteristics of the selected farms. Data from the reference

    the environmental performance of grapes from vineyards operating under the same
    climatic conditions and employing on-site weather stations and identify the aspects
    related to the different farm management techniques that significantly influence
    their environmental footprint. The functional unit (FU) chosen for this study
    was 1 kg of grapes produced; an FU based on mass was considered more suitable
    when only upstream processes were considered (Pizzigallo et al., 2008; Zambelli
    et al., 2023). Modelling was performed using SimaPro software (ver. 9.1.1.1) (PRé-sustainability,
    2023). A “from cradle to farm gate” approach was adopted (Fig. 1), i.e., from
    the production of raw materials to obtaining grapes. The vineyard planting stage
    and explantation stage were excluded from the analysis to avoid additional uncertainties
    from data with poor accuracy provided by the farms. Gazulla et al. (2010) excluded
    these stages by considering the long average lifespan (30–70 years) of vineyards.
    Replacement of dead or damaged vines was a usual activity carried out during the
    year. Therefore, the impacts of this activity were included in grape production.
    In general, these stages are included when analysing impacts related to transitioning
    from one agricultural technique to another (Falcone et al., 2016; Ferrara and
    De Feo, 2018). The soil operations considered for each farm are listed in Table
    1. All inputs (water, fuel, energy, fertilisers, and pesticides) and output flows
    (emissions into the air, water, soil, and waste) were considered for each agricultural
    stage or activity within the defined boundaries (Fig. 1). These data refer to
    the year 2021. Given the seasonal variability of crops and microclimatic conditions,
    which could also imply variability in the characteristics of agricultural practices
    (Ferrara and De Feo, 2018), it is advisable to use average data over three or
    more years (Borsato et al., 2020; Harb et al., 2021). However, referring to a
    single year is typical (Gazulla et al., 2010; Harb et al., 2021; Laca et al.,
    2021; Russo et al., 2021) because of the difficulty of conducting data collection
    over multiple years. Download : Download high-res image (157KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 1. System boundaries. Facilities and equipment used to manufacture
    farm tools and machinery, as well as products and infrastructure related to employees''
    needs, were excluded (Pradel et al., 2022). Waste produced by employees during
    field operations, such as disposable masks, gloves, boots, and overalls, was not
    considered as their quantity, in terms of mass, did not exceed 1 % of the total.
    Vineyard stakes were excluded from the study because they were in the planting
    stage (Fusi et al., 2014). Finally, the wires for tying the shoots were not considered,
    as it was difficult to quantify all the manufacturing materials used, as they
    were made of mixed materials (e.g. rubber, plastic, iron, and natural twine).
    Regarding the multifunctionality issue, the following choices were made: Farm
    Dtr-practiced fertigation integrates fertilisation into an irrigation system.
    The fertigation equipment was powered using a diesel generator. Thus, the allocation
    of diesel consumption between fertilisation and irrigation processes is required.
    The allocation could have been carried out considering the diesel needed to pump
    water for irrigation only and for fertilisation (Casson et al., 2022). Because
    such data were not available, we opted for an allocation criterion based on the
    mass (of water and fertiliser, respectively). In addition to being the most widespread
    allocation criterion, it also expresses a causal relationship between the flow
    to be allocated (amount of diesel consumed) and the functions provided (amount
    of water and fertiliser, respectively), as recommended by ISO 14044 (ISO, 2006).
    Therefore, based on the mass of water and fertiliser used in fertigation by Farm
    Dtr in the reference year, 1/6 of the diesel consumption for fertigation was allocated
    to the fertilisation phase, and the remaining 5/6 was allocated to irrigation.
    2.2.2. Life cycle inventory The input data collection (Table 2), initially conducted
    using a questionnaire to obtain the primary data, was subsequently completed and
    expanded through several direct interviews with the farms'' reference technicians.
    Pesticide emissions in the three areas (air, water, and soil) were computed using
    the environmental distribution suggested by Mackay''s model (level I) (Mackay
    and Paterson, 1981). Considering this distribution, substances for which data
    were not found were computed according to the Product Environmental Footprint
    (PEF) guidelines developed by the Joint Research Centre (JRC), which assume that
    90 % of the substance is emitted into the agricultural soil compartment, 9 % into
    the air, and 1 % into the water (Zampori and Pant, 2019). The JRC guidelines,
    which propose specific emission factors for the main fertilising substances, were
    also considered for fertiliser emissions (Zampori and Pant, 2019). Secondary data
    were obtained from the Ecoinvent database (Ecoinvent database 3.5, 2018) and the
    Agri-Footprint database (Agri-Footprint 5.0, 2019); specifically, the collated
    data pertained to fuel, electricity, raw material production, transportation,
    and waste treatment. Table 2. Data inventory related to the selected FU (1 kg

    impact assessment The CML-2001 baseline V3.06/EU25 LCIA method was used for the
    impact assessment phase as it is the most widely used assessment method in this
    context (Ferrara and De Feo, 2018). The impact categories considered were abiotic
    depletion (elements and ultimate reserves) (AD), abiotic depletion (fossil fuels)
    (ADff), global warming (GW), ozone layer depletion (OLD), human toxicity (HT),
    photochemical oxidation (PO), acidification (AF), eutrophication (EP), freshwater
    aquatic ecotoxicity (FAE), marine aquatic ecotoxicity (MAE), and terrestrial ecotoxicity
    (TE). Normalisation, which is an optional step in the LCAs, was also performed.
    For normalisation, the absolute impact indicators for the various impact categories
    are compared to reference scores – the so-called “normalisation factors” (NFs)
    – describing the impacts associated with a reference system, e.g. a region (Sala
    et al., 2017; D''Ammaro et al., 2021b), to obtain dimensionless indices. Therefore,
    normalisation allows comparisons between impact categories by expressing them
    on a common scale. In this study, the NFs were based on the total impacts for
    the EU 25 area, according to the CML2001 method. 3. Results and discussion The
    characterisation results for the environmental footprint of each farm are shown
    in Table 3. The relative contribution of the vineyards to each impact category,
    presented in Fig. 2, highlighted that the smart organic farm (Csm) contributed
    to eight impact categories out of 11 impact categories more than the other farms.
    These results are in agreement with those of previous studies (Renaud-Gentié et
    al., 2020; Rouault et al., 2016; Rugani et al., 2013; Venkat, 2012), highlighting
    that organic farms may have worse environmental effects than conventional farms.
    It should be noted that the impacts of the traditional Farm Dtr were similar or
    sometimes even lower than those of the smart farms, except for FAE, which had
    the greatest contribution by far. However, to identify the environmental criticalities
    and better understand which phases of production most affected the performance
    of each farm, an analysis of the contributions to the impact categories from soil
    operations (detailed for each farm in Table 1), irrigation, fertilisation, and
    plant protection treatments was conducted (Table 3). The analysis of the life
    cycle stages, presented in Fig. 3, shows that in Farms Bsm, Csm, and Dtr, soil
    operations made the greatest contribution to most of the impact categories. In
    contrast, irrigation, particularly the related electricity consumption, has the
    greatest impact in Farm Asm. Fertilisation in Farms Asm and Bsm and the use of
    pesticides in Farms Csm and Dtr had the second-greatest impact. Therefore, in
    line with Lamastra et al. (2016), pesticides and fertilisers did not have the
    most relevant effects at the vineyards considered. Criticalities persisting in
    the life cycle stages of smart farms are analysed and discussed in the following
    sections. Moreover, a comparison with the literature was made considering that
    grape production is heterogeneous, making comparisons with other studies difficult
    owing to different choices regarding FU, system boundaries, and other assumptions
    (Letamendi et al., 2022). Table 3. Contribution of the various farm activities

    emissions. 3.1. Fuel consumption and impact of soil operations Considerable differences
    were observed among the smart farms with regard to fuel consumption (Table 2).
    Organic Farm Csm had the highest diesel consumption (75 g/kg), which was approximately
    double that of Farm Bsm and approximately six times that of Farm Asm. The fuel
    consumption of Farm Csm was similar to that of Farm Dtr. Comparison of diesel
    consumption of the vineyards involved in this study with the other vineyards located
    in Sardinia. Indeed, the diesel consumption (105.6 g/kg) reported by Marras et
    al. (2015) was two to nine times higher than that of the farms considered in this
    study. On the contrary, in the Sardinian vineyard analysed by Benedetto (2013)
    and Fusi et al. (2014) (after converting into g/kg the data originally referring
    to 1 0.75-L bottle of wine as a FU, corresponding to 1.1 kg of grape), the consumption
    of diesel (around 11 g/kg) was similar to that of Farm Asm, but lower than that
    of the other farms. The fuel consumption of these vineyards was also higher than
    that of the farms located outside Sardinia. The diesel consumption (after conversion
    of data from L/ha to g/kg of grapes) for 15 conventional wines from 8 farms located
    in various regions of central-northern Italy (D''Ammaro et al., 2021b) varied
    between approximately 8 g/kg and 60 g/kg (on average 35 ± 17.5 g/kg), thus placing
    the conventional vineyard Dtr of our study towards the higher end of this range.
    Compared with other organic farms, the diesel consumption of Farm Csm was around
    four times higher than farms in the north of Italy (Masotti et al., 2022), and
    around five to eight times higher than the Spanish farms analysed by Villanueva-Rey
    et al. (2014) across two different years (15 g/kg and 9.2 g/kg, respectively).
    Notably, the farms considered in the aforementioned studies had higher yields
    than the smart farms considered in the present study. As the yield increases,
    the incidence of inputs and the related impacts per unit of harvested produce
    tends to decrease. Therefore, grape yield is a sensitive parameter that affects
    the environmental performance of vineyards (Bosco et al., 2011; Sinisterra-Solís
    et al., 2020). Diesel consumption was allocated to soil operations, irrigation,
    fertilisation, and pesticide application (complementary Table S1) to evaluate
    its contribution to the different impact categories of the fuel used for various
    agricultural operations. Across the four farms examined, 70 % (approximately 60
    % in Farm Bsm and more than 80 % in Dtr), on average, of the fuel employed and
    the related impacts were attributable to soil operations. The remaining fuel was
    used to distribute fertilisers and pesticides, as discussed in 3.3 Fertilisation,
    3.4 Plant protection treatments. More specifically, the incidence of the fuel-related
    impacts for fertiliser application ranged from approximately 7 % (Csm) to almost
    25 % (Bsm) (excluding Dtr, which carried out fertigation) of the overall fuel-related
    impacts. As regards the application of plant protection products, the percentage
    contributions ranged from approximately 14 % (Asm) to almost 20 % (Csm) of the
    overall fuel-related impacts. Focusing on soil operations, it can be seen that
    Farm Asm recorded the lowest impact for all categories (Fig. 3) since it carried
    out fewer operations than the other farms (Table 1). In contrast, organic Farm
    Csm, despite not conducting certain agricultural operations (such as tillage and
    pre-pruning), had the highest impact. This farm had to repeat the practice of
    mechanical weed control five times a year, which the other farms either did not
    carry out (Asm and Bsm) or carried out only once (Dtr). In the organic farm, this
    practice had to be repeated to prevent the grass from acting as a competitor for
    water and nutrients, since Farm Csm chose to avoid irrigation and had mostly sandy
    soil that has very low water retention capacity. Therefore, the extent of the
    environmental impacts largely depends on farmers'' management choices, as observed
    by Tuomisto et al. (2012). Owing to fuel consumption, soil operations generally
    had the highest impact on the categories AD, ADff, GW, OLD, HT, MAE, PO, and AF
    (Table 3), confirming the results obtained by Fusi et al. (2014) and Marras et
    al. (2015). Field energy was the input most related to GHG emissions, even in
    Greek farms (Balafoutis et al., 2017), regardless of whether conventional or precision
    viticulture techniques were used. Sinisterra-Solís et al. (2020) and Volanti et
    al. (2022) confirmed the primary role of machinery fuel on the negative environmental
    performances of both organic and conventional Spanish farms. In comparison with
    the literature, the GW impact category was mostly correlated with fuel consumption.
    Across the four farms analysed in this study, this category showed a value between
    0.28 and 0.61 kg CO2e (Table 3), within the range of about 0.1 to 1.42 kg CO2e
    per kg of grapes observed in conventional (Balafoutis et al., 2017; Borsato et
    al., 2020; Bosco et al., 2011; D''Ammaro et al., 2021b; Harb et al., 2021; Laca
    et al., 2021; Sinisterra-Solís et al., 2020) and integrated (Rouault et al., 2016)
    vineyards. The organic vineyard has a value of 0.61 kg CO2e, approximately 30
    % higher than the average of the other vineyards. Therefore, as confirmed by other
    studies (Rouault et al., 2016; Rugani et al., 2013), the common opinion that organic
    agriculture has a lower carbon footprint than conventional agriculture is not
    universal. On the contrary, the behaviour of Farm Csm differed from that observed
    in other organic farms whose value of GW was lower than that of conventional,
    and precisely 0.8–0.9 kg CO2e/kg and 0.138 kg CO2e/kg (average value over a 5-year
    period) of grapes in vineyards in the north of Italy found by Masotti et al. (2022)
    and Borsato et al. (2020), respectively. Finally, the GW of Farm Csm is not even
    comparable with that obtained in Spanish organic vineyards, where the values range
    between about 0.05 and 0.13 kg CO2e per kg of grapes (Sinisterra-Solís et al.,
    2020; Villanueva-Rey et al., 2014). In the farms analysed by Villanueva-Rey et
    al. (2014), however, most of the operations were carried out by hand, thus reducing
    the use of diesel by 80 %. As suggested by other authors (Vázquez-Rowe et al.,
    2012; Neto et al., 2013), reducing fuel consumption is the primary strategy for
    improving the environmental performance of vineyards. Several solutions have been
    proposed to mitigate emissions from fuel combustion, such as reducing the number
    and types of operations in vineyards in each season (Rugani et al., 2013) and
    introducing livestock to manage grass (Villanueva-Rey et al., 2014; Longbottom
    and Petrie, 2015). These activities imply efforts by agronomists to revise vineyard
    management techniques. Adopting eco-driving systems for tractors (Dettù et al.,
    2022), most-performing engines, and biofuel-powered (Hosseinzadeh-Bandbafha et
    al., 2021), green hydrogen-powered, or electric (Baker et al., 2022; Gao and Xue,
    2020; Gorjian et al., 2021; Lagnelöv et al., 2021; Scolaro et al., 2021) tractors
    could contribute decisively to reducing impacts, a solution which, given the costs
    of high-tech machinery, is currently difficult to consider, especially in the
    case of small farms. 3.2. Water consumption and irrigation Water conservation
    is one of the primary reasons why smart farms use on-site weather stations. Irrigation
    was not carried out at the organic Farm Csm, whereas significant differences in
    water consumption were recorded among the other farms (Table 2). The consumption
    of Farm Asm was 10 times lower (0.05 m3/kg) than Farm Bsm. Farm Dtr performed
    best in terms of water consumption (0.0015 m3/kg) despite not using IoT devices
    to detect soil moisture. This difference did not seem to be attributable to the
    irrigation technique, as smart farms were using variable drip irrigation, whereas
    Farm Dtr adopted a drip-irrigation system with a uniform rate, which was found
    to have a consumption of approximately 9 % higher than the variable rate drip-irrigation
    system (Casson et al., 2022) implemented by smart farms. In this regard, the considerable
    effect was due to the different soil texture, which in Farm Asm was loamy (i.e.,
    “medium-textured”, with a balanced presence of sand, silt and clay), in Farm Bsm
    was sandy and, therefore, had a poor water-holding capacity and a tendency to
    remain dry during the summer season, while the soil in Farm Dtr was mainly clayey
    and was thus able to retain a great deal of water. The latter also utilises zeolite,
    which helps to keep the soil aerated and moist for a long time (Yasuda et al.,
    1998) by reducing the need for irrigation. Farm Bsm''s agronomist claimed that
    by using the on-site weather station with moisture-sensing sensors in the field,
    irrigation became more rational, preventing the over- or under-watering of different
    areas of the field; however, this did not result in less overall water consumption.
    This technician justified the high water consumption by stating that water stress
    shortens the life cycle of the vines, resulting in high economic losses for the
    farm. The techno-managerial approach of Farm Csm (no irrigation) does not seem
    appropriate for oenologists because high water stress can influence the organoleptic
    characteristics of grapes and, consequently, wine. Indeed, irrigation gives the
    red wine higher acidity and a better “bouchet” of polyphenols (Borsato et al.,
    2020; Cavaliere et al., 2010) and the white one a higher aromatic expression with
    a lower bitter taste (Zufferey et al., 2020). However, the example of Farm Csm
    demonstrated that even when operating in Mediterranean climatic conditions and
    with a soil texture which is predominantly sandy, water saving could be possible.
    Thus, in Farm Bsm, water management seems inefficient, and all the opportunities
    offered by on-site weather stations should be exploited. Another aspect that might
    affect water use is the grapevine cultivar, as identified by Balafoutis et al.
    (2017) in the northern Greek vineyards, where water consumption was different
    in the case of the Sauvignon and Syrah cultivars (0.23 m3/kg and 0.11 m3/kg, respectively).
    Sinisterra-Solís et al. (2020) observed that in Spanish vineyards where different
    varieties were cultivated, the differences in water consumption and other inputs
    were ascribed to the yield more than the varieties. In this research, the grapevine
    variety was excluded as a factor influencing the considerable differences in water
    consumption observed since Vermentino was the exclusive or predominant grape variety
    cultivated, and, in any case, all the varieties were managed the same way across
    the farms. Therefore, soil characteristics and vineyard management choices may
    be more important than other factors in determining water use. Considering that
    water scarcity and the excessive exploitation of aquifers are factors linked to
    ongoing climate change and that forecasts indicate a growing demand for water
    in the Mediterranean area in the near future (Mancuso et al., 2020), the reduction
    of water consumption is an important challenge for Sardinian viticulture. Therefore,
    various management options should be considered in vineyards, such as adopting
    effective cultivation methods that leave the soil settled to prevent the surface
    runoff of rainwater or avoiding trampling that reduces the macropores, which are
    considered true soil reservoirs (Giordano, 1999). As shown in Table 3, the irrigation
    phase generated impacts only in Farms Asm and Dtr because of the energy consumption
    required to power the irrigation system. Farm Asm drew water from a well that
    used electricity to run a pump to pressurise the irrigation system, and Farm Dtr
    used a diesel-powered generator to distribute water from the municipal supply
    network. In Farm Bsm, the impact of irrigation was zero because it did not consume
    energy, as it applied gravity-fed surface irrigation by drawing water from a reservoir.
    Irrigation, the most impactful phase in Farm Asm, was responsible for approximately
    50 % of its total impact on the categories linked to air emissions (Table 3),
    which may be attributable to the Italian power mix that is largely dependent on
    fossil fuels. Apart from the drip irrigation already practised by farms, Russo
    et al. (2021) recommended using deficit irrigation and the implementation of photovoltaic-powered
    irrigation to mitigate GHG emissions and make vineyards more resilient to drought
    phenomena. Deficit irrigation is possible in the Mediterranean regions, as demonstrated
    by Farm Csm. However, as stated previously, the effects of high water stress on
    the quantity and quality of production must be considered. The employment of renewable
    energy sources could be an appropriate choice from an environmental perspective
    and could even be integrated into vineyards through innovative specific agrivoltaic
    solutions (enovoltaics) (Padilla et al., 2022). The impacts of irrigation were
    greater in Farm Asm than in the Dtr (Table 3) because the latter applied fertigation.
    Indeed, as explained in Subsection 2.2.1, the diesel consumption to power the
    fertigation equipment was partly allocated to the fertilisation phase and the
    remainder to irrigation. Considering the experiences of the traditional Farm Dtr,
    fertigation could be another solution for mitigating the impact of irrigation.
    However, this technique is difficult to apply to land with a high slope, and only
    fertilisers with high water solubility can be distributed. However, the trade-off
    between water and energy consumption must be considered to meet the vine cultivation
    and grape quality requirements (Roselli et al., 2020). 3.3. Fertilisation In the
    fertilisation phase, different fertilisers purchased from the market were used
    in the vineyards. In addition, unlike the traditional Farm Dtr, smart farms utilise
    green manure to enrich the soil with nutrients. Farm Asm estimated the input of
    nutrients from pruning residues of a sample of vines for a more rational use of
    fertiliser. Generally, eutrophication is the category in which fertilisation has
    the greatest impact. EP impact was generated almost exclusively by fertilisation,
    which contributed more than 95 % of the total EP impact, except for the Farm Csm,
    where the contribution of fertilisation to EP was only 10 % of the total. The
    contribution of fertilisation to the total impact was by far the weakest in Farm
    Csm because, for the various categories, its contribution to the total ranged
    between 5 % and 10 % (on average 7 %), decidedly lower than the impact levels,
    ranging between 27 % and 42 % (on average 34 % excluding EP), found in Farm Bsm.
    Although the traditional Farm Dtr used only chemical fertilisers and did not use
    green manure, the contribution of this phase to the various impact categories,
    excluding EP, ranged between 0 % and 17 % (on average, 7 %) of the total, an impact
    similar to or sometimes lower than that of smart farms. To explain the different
    behaviours and better understand which factors related to the fertilisation phase
    had the greatest impact, the contributions to the different categories given by
    the use of machinery for distributing the fertilisers, the production of the fertilisers
    and their fate in the environment, the transport of fertilisers to the farm from
    the sale point, and their packaging were considered. Across all the farms considered,
    the contribution of transporting fertilisers to the farm and their packaging''s
    production and end-of-life was generally negligible (Table 4). In contrast, the
    major impact on most categories was due to the fuel for the machinery used for
    fertiliser application. Farm Dtr had a lower impact owing to machinery use than
    smart farms (Table 4) because it practised fertigation. The change in fertiliser
    management from conventional to fertigated led to a reduction in emissions derived
    from the application of products, thus, confirming the findings of Casson et al.
    (2022). Table 4. Contribution of the fertilisation and plant protection treatments

    −1,88E−08 4,20E−10 sm = smart farm; tr = traditional farm. When considering only
    the impacts of the products, the data reported in Table 4 provide evidence that
    the products utilised by Farm Csm (algae) had the lowest impact. In this vineyard,
    the fertilisers'' contribution to the total impact of the various categories did
    not exceed 3 %. At the same time, in the other farms, excluding EP, it ranged
    between 1 % and 20 % of the total. Fertilisers contributed, on average, for 5
    % of Farm Asm and Dtr and 10 % of Bsm to the total. In Farm Bsm, the greatest
    contribution was from NPK-based fertilisers. These products were also used by
    Farm Dtr; however, the amounts employed were one-third of those employed by Farm
    Bsm (Table 2). Farm Dtr had a nutrient-rich, clayey soil with less need for fertilisers
    (Table 1). Furthermore, it uses zeolite, one of its properties being the prolonged
    action of the fertiliser, which prevents the leaching of nutrients into the soil
    (Soltys et al., 2020). NPK-based products affect different product categories.
    The contribution of these fertilisers to GW, PO, and AF is principally related
    to their production processes, particularly the consumption of fossil fuels and
    the extraction of phosphorus or potassium from rock materials (Bosco et al., 2011;
    Casson et al., 2022). Furthermore, urea production contributed to the HT category,
    especially with regard to the emission of metals (in particular, Ba, Ni, Cr VI,
    and Hg). P- and N-based compounds were responsible for the eutrophication caused
    by Farms Bsm and Dtr (Fig. 2). These products are translocated through runoff
    and leach into water, which significantly affects the EP category (Jourdaine et
    al., 2020; Ngatia and Taylor, 2018). Farm Asm, which used pelleted manure, contributed
    the most to the ecotoxicity categories (Table 4). Manure is considered a product
    with a high environmental burden, principally regarding CH4 emissions when spread
    on the soil (Volanti et al., 2022). Nevertheless, it was proved that pelletising-drying
    could lower the nitrogen and CH4 emissions from agro-biowaste compost (Ball et
    al., 2004) and mitigate the farm''s environmental impact by more than 63 % (Sarlaki
    et al., 2021). In addition, the pelleted manure used in Farm Asm was inoculated
    with the selected microbial strains. Compared to those not inoculated, this fertiliser
    allows a 40–60 % reduction in N2O emissions (Nishizawa et al., 2014). Therefore,
    the impact of Farm Asm may have been overestimated. Pelleted manure principally
    affected the EP category, like the NPK compounds. Therefore, approximately 97
    % of the eutrophication caused by Farm Asm was due to this natural fertiliser.
    Other natural products, such as algae employed by Farm Csm, had little effect
    on all environmental categories, including EP. Thus, vineyards employing natural
    fertilisers did not necessarily have a lower level of impact than those utilising
    synthetic fertilisers, as highlighted by the comparison between Farms Asm and
    Dtr. Therefore, farmers should consciously choose the type and quantity of these
    products while considering their environmental burden. 3.4. Plant protection treatments
    In smart vineyards, on-site weather stations integrated with DSS were used for
    irrigation and pest management. Indeed, microclimatic conditions, such as local
    temperature, sun exposure, and average annual rainfall, influence vine diseases,
    and the quantity of pesticides to be applied in the vineyard (Ferrara and De Feo,
    2018). As shown in Table 2, differences were observed in the types and quantities
    of pesticides used in the vineyards. Similar to other certified organic farms
    (Borsato et al., 2020; Masotti et al., 2022; Volanti et al., 2022), Farm Csm exclusively
    utilises mineral products, and this type of plant protection product is among
    the few pesticides allowed in organic farming. However, considering that Cu accumulation
    may alter soil life, using Cu compounds in viticulture remains controversial.
    Karimi et al. (2021) reported that an amount of up to 4 kg/ha/year of Cu should
    not substantially modify soil biological quality and function. Based on this consideration,
    the amount of copper used by Farm Csm (2.7 kg/ha/year) was lower than the proposed
    limit (Karimi et al., 2021). The same considerations are valid for Farm Asm and
    Dtr utilising an amount of Cu compounds equal to 0.05 kg/ha/year and 0.9 kg/ha/year,
    respectively. Smart Farms Asm and Bsm, as well as the traditional Dtr, utilised
    mineral and synthetic products, particularly mancozeb, folpet, and fosetyl-aluminium,
    as a single pesticide or a combination thereof (Table 2). These chemicals are
    often used in conventional viticulture, as observed in Italian (Borsato et al.,
    2020; Ferrara and De Feo, 2018; Fusi et al., 2014), French (Rouault et al., 2016),
    and Spanish (Vázquez-Rowe et al., 2012; Villanueva-Rey et al., 2014) vineyards.
    Generally, the categories in which the pest control phase had the greatest impact
    were abiotic depletion and ecotoxicity. The contribution of these categories to
    the total burden was higher than the levels registered for the others, accounting
    for 1 % to 15 % on all the farms, except for the organic vineyard Csm, where the
    levels ranged between 20 % to 24 %. Notably, in this phase, traditional farms
    that did not use advanced technologies had similar or lower impacts than smart
    farms across all categories except for FAE and TE (Table 3). To identify the factors
    related to pest control that contributed the most to the different categories,
    the impacts of using machinery, products, and the transport and packaging of pesticides
    were considered (Table 4). As previously observed for fertilisation, these latter
    factors made a negligible contribution to the impact categories, whereas the greatest
    impact was attributable to the use of machinery to spread pesticides. This factor
    had the highest incidence in the organic Farm Csm, which was carried out twice
    as many times (12/year) with low doses of pesticides compared to the other farms,
    as it used highly leachable sulfur and copper-based products. Similar results
    have been observed in Italian (Volanti et al., 2022), French (Rouault et al.,
    2016), and Cypriot (Litskas et al., 2020) organic vineyards. Litskas et al. (2020)
    attributed the substitution of synthetic pesticides to an increase in fuel consumption.
    In the case of Farm Csm, the replacement of chemicals increased treatment frequency
    and, consequently, aggravated the impacts associated with the pest control phase.
    By considering only the plant protection products, generally, for all the categories,
    excluding abiotic depletion and those linked to ecotoxicity, the contribution
    of pesticides to the total burden ranged between 1 and 5 %. To summarise, the
    contribution of pesticides to the total impact caused by the vineyards was, on
    average, 15 %, 3 %, 4 %, and 17 % for Farm Asm, Bsm, Csm, and Dtr, respectively.
    Farm Asm had the greatest impact in five of the 11 categories (Table 4), principally
    due to the pesticides mancozeb and fosetyl-aluminium. Mancozeb, also used by Farm
    Bsm in quantities similar to Asm, mainly affects AD due to the extraction of sulfur
    and metals employed for its production, as this pesticide is a manganese/zinc
    ethylene-bis-dithiocarbamate, and PO and AF for sulfur dioxide emissions during
    its production. Mancozeb''s contribution to MAE due to the toxic effect of this
    pesticide on aquatic organisms (Vieira et al., 2020) was negligible (1 % of the
    total burden), confirming the findings of Russo et al. (2021). Considering that
    mancozeb exposure has been linked to a wide range of environmental and health
    hazards, the European Commission issued Regulation No. 2020/2087 (2020), which
    banned mancozeb use from 2022. Despite this, in 2021 (the year of data collection),
    two smart farms were using this pesticide, contrary to the traditional Farm Dtr,
    which did not utilise this product. Folpet and fosetyl-aluminium were used in
    Farms Asm and Dtr. In particular, these pesticides affected the impact categories
    connected to ecotoxicity due to their emissions into the air, water, and soil
    (Table 4). The effect of these two vineyards on FAE depended entirely (99 %) on
    the use of Folpet, and the impact of Farm Dtr on TE was, for about 70 % of the
    total, depending on the use of fosetyl-aluminium; Asm and Dtr use these two products
    in different quantities. In particular, Farm Asm used approximately one-third
    of the folpet (0.025 g/kg) used by the other farm and tripled the quantity of
    fosetyl-aluminium (0.43 g/kg). The various quantities of these two pesticides
    used indicated that Farm Asm contributed the most to MAE, and Dtr contributed
    the most to FAE and TE (Table 4). Other viticulture studies (Renaud-Gentié et
    al., 2015; Vázquez-Rowe et al., 2012; Villanueva-Rey et al., 2014) have highlighted
    the effects of folpet on MAE. Organic Farm Csm, which exclusively used mineral
    products based on copper, sulfur, and bentonite, had the least impact on all categories
    except for AD, HT, and EP, which made the most significant contributions. AD is
    related to sulfur and copper extraction, whereas the production of copper (Beylot
    and Villeneuve, 2017) and bentonite, to a minor extent (Zhou et al., 2021), contributes
    to HT and EP. The effect of Cu compounds on these categories is mainly linked
    to the emission of toxic metals during production and storage (Beylot and Villeneuve,
    2017). Cu-related impacts may be overestimated because they are not adequately
    characterised by existing LCIA methods (Rouault et al., 2020). 3.5. Normalisation
    The normalized results (complementary Fig. S1) showed that the categories that,
    in general, presented the greatest relative impacts were FAE (especially for Farms
    Bsm and Asm) and MAE, followed by EP (except for Farm Csm). Plant protection treatments
    are responsible for virtually all contributions to FAE. MAE was mainly affected
    by soil operations (diesel), except for Farm Asm, which was irrigation because
    of related power generation. However, as highlighted in the literature, toxicity
    categories have a particularly high degree of uncertainty owing to incomplete
    inventory data for the reference system and lack of characterisation factors (Benini
    and Sala, 2016; Crenna et al., 2019; Scalbi et al., 2015; Van Hoof et al., 2013).
    Therefore, excluding the toxicity categories, the most affected impact category
    in Farms Asm, Bsm, and Dtr was EP due to the fertilisation phase. Fertilisation
    affected EP in both Farm Asm and Bsm through the phosphorus pentoxide included
    in the fertilisation product. In Farm Csm normalisation, the highest contribution
    was made by soil operations in all impact categories, confirming what was found
    with the characterisation. Excluding MAE, the most affected impact category was
    ADff, due to the use of fossil fuels. 4. Conclusion Considering the limited studies
    related to the effect of smart farming on environmental impacts, research was
    conducted to evaluate the ecological effectiveness of vineyards employing on-site
    weather stations integrated with a DSS and to identify the critical hotspots that
    may persist in smart farms which have already started on the path towards sustainability.
    The results obtained through the LCA methodology showed that soil characteristics
    can exert both positive and negative influences on various aspects of environmental
    performance, irrespective of the use of decision-supporting technological devices.
    Agricultural machinery or electricity use were the major sources of impact; therefore,
    the main strategy for vineyard sustainability involves adopting measures to reduce
    the use of field energy. In addition, the results of this study highlight that
    replacing agrochemicals with natural products would not be the most appropriate
    choice from an environmental perspective. The contribution of organic fertilisers
    to certain impact categories could be higher than that of synthetic products,
    as in the case of an integrated smart farm which utilised pelleted manure, which
    had the greatest effect on the categories linked to ecotoxicity. Moreover, the
    objective of reducing herbicide, fertiliser, pesticide use, and water consumption
    in compliance with integrated or biological certification requirements shifted
    some of the environmental burdens to other life cycle steps, as in the case of
    the organic farm, whereby the water footprint improved, but the carbon footprint
    worsened. Employing on-site weather stations to monitor climatic and soil conditions
    is insufficient for improving environmental performance. This study could enhance
    management and staff awareness of the importance of an integrated assessment throughout
    the life cycle stages of products to ensure a robust methodology to effectively
    leverage the advantage of technological innovation. Moreover, this study could
    be significant in assisting relevant stakeholders with decision-making to ensure
    a balanced trade-off between environmentally friendly and economically feasible
    options. A limitation of this study is that it was not possible to analyse the
    environmental performance of grape production before and after the installation
    of on-site weather stations to better understand how much these technologies could
    influence it. Further studies are required to deepen our knowledge of the environmental
    effects of smart farming to allow farmers to profit from the prime opportunities
    offered by smart technologies. Moreover, to achieve this objective, the economic
    aspects of grape production can effectively contribute to a comparative analysis
    of the sustainability of adopting technical management. The following are the

    of geospatial decision support research, particularly when considering vulnerability,

    Previous research enumerated a collection of V-R-R-S conceptual component commonalties

    within decision support systems. The core relationship within the VRRSability
    framework is ‘functional performance’, which couples land and water concerns within
    complex ULWS. Using functional performance, we elucidate other significant conceptual
    relationships, e.g., scale, scenarios and social knowledge, among others. A narrative
    about the functional performance of green stormwater infrastructure as part of
    a ULWS offers a practical application of the conceptual framework. VRRSability
    decision evaluation trade-offs among land and water emerge through the narrative,

  explanation: The paper introduces the concept of VRRSability and explains how it
    can be used to improve geoinformation decision support. The authors argue that
    VRRSability is a more comprehensive and useful concept than vulnerability, risk,
    resilience, and sustainability when it comes to making decisions about complex
    systems. They provide a detailed explanation of the VRRSability framework and
    how it can be used to evaluate the different components of a system.

    Keywords: VRRSability; vulnerability; risk; resilience; sustainability; urban

    An enhanced understanding of the trade-offs among decision evaluation objectives
    continues to motivate researchers and practitioners for improving geospatial decision
    support applications [1], particularly geodesign decision support for complex
    ‘sustainable systems’ evaluation [2]. The term ‘sustainable’ acts as a descriptor
    for many complex systems because of an interest in the ‘longevity of health and
    well-being’ of such systems. Decision support software applications encode our
    basic understanding of what we know about making decisions within programming
    languages and databases [1], whether for entire systems and/or portions thereof.
    Developing comprehensive frameworks is one way to contextualize complex system
    issues as a step toward practical implementation of applications, moving from
    data into information and onto knowledge-based applications, e.g., in the form
    of knowledge graphs representing open knowledge networks implemented using artificial
    general intelligence agents designed to help humans facilitate inter-organizational
    collaboration on decision support [3] about VRRSability decision trade-offs. As
    part of the initial research about the fundamentals of sustainable systems, a
    framework called measurement-informed ontology and epistemology for sustainability
    information representation (MOESIR) was developed to clarify the steps for framing
    the development of spatial decision support systems [4]. Related research used
    a geodesign approach to decision support for examining green infrastructure development
    as a part of complex urban–land water systems (ULWS), concluding that we need
    more insight in addition to the vulnerability of systems to inform complex system
    decision evaluation [2,5]. Addressing that concern, other research identified
    vulnerability, risk, resilience, and sustainability (V-R-R-S) as four concepts
    commonly used in participatory decision support for sustainable systems [6]. We
    demonstrated that none of the four V-R-R-S concepts can replace one another when
    evaluating sustainable systems. Furthermore, VRRSability was identified as an
    overarching concept that synthesizes among V-R-R-S concepts and their associated
    components, providing an opportunity to facilitate decision trade-offs [6]. However,
    that research stopped short of elucidating conceptual relationships, which is
    a necessary next step for developing operational models. The research effort reported
    herein represents a fourth effort in the series for extending and deepening collaborative
    decision support systems. The overall goal of this research is to broaden and
    deepen geospatial decision research that eventually implements a comprehensive
    yet flexible approach to decision evaluation within a geodesign decision support
    system. The objectives to reach that goal include the following: (1) complete
    a conceptual synthesis of VRRSability useful for decision evaluation, (2) specify
    constructs and their relationships within operational models based on the conceptual
    synthesis; (3) implement the operational models using geospatial technologies,
    making it clear that the synthesis precedes operational models that precede software
    technology implementation, e.g., within geospatial decision support systems, geographic
    information systems (GIS), and/or remote sensing. As such, the main objective
    of this paper is to report on the completion of the conceptual synthesis (at least
    to some extent) resulting in knowledge contributions within three focus areas.
    First, knowledge resulting from VRRSability synthesis flesh out MOESIR Tier 2
    ontology and MOESIR Tier 4 epistemology for contributing to the focus area of
    geospatial ontology and epistemology. Second, the VRRSability conceptual framework
    composed of components and relations provides a solid foundation (in both breadth
    and depth) for the next step in operationalizing models characterizing decision
    evaluation trade-offs contributing to the focus area of geodesign assessment.
    Third, preliminary knowledge about the operationalization of VRRSability models
    using a VRRSability intelligence ramp of data, information, evidence, knowledge
    and wisdom contributes to the emerging focus area of artificial intelligence technology
    development. Further formalization of concepts and relationships through the development
    of a comprehensive conceptual framework, consisting of conceptual components and
    relations among them, can guide the operationalization of decision evaluation
    trade-offs for improving software-enabled intelligence about the health and well-being
    of sustainable systems. The development of a comprehensive conceptual framework
    further details the synthesis across V-R-R-S, enabling articulation of VRRSability
    relationships as a basis for the examination of decision evaluation trade-offs.
    Identifying a core relationship between a stressor and receptor in terms of functional
    performance provides a basis for elucidating nuances among the V-R-R-S concepts
    and associated components of VRRSability. Application of the conceptual framework
    to green stormwater infrastructure (GSI) offers further insights into GSI functional
    performance as a key issue for improving decision evaluation at watershed and
    regional scales. Measuring the functional performance of low-impact development
    as an example of GSI can provide important insights into investments in, and implementation
    of, stormwater management options for addressing concerns about climate change
    within urban watershed environments [7]. GSI redevelopments, i.e., removing contaminants
    from fresh and estuarine waters plus the control of flooding through natural means,
    are of high interest world-wide for improving the sustainability of health and
    well-being within ULWS, particularly along coastal areas [5]. Micro-, meso-, and
    macro-scale insights are needed when considering reductions in vulnerability,
    risk mitigation, improving the resiliency of response, and enhancing the sustainability
    of well-being for both humans and the environment within urban–regional watersheds.
    Moving toward the operationalization of VRRSability, a functional performance
    relationship between land and water offers a basis for characterizing how insights
    about data representations as measurements can lead to improved information representations
    as relationships among measurements. Formalizing information representations provides
    a basis for evidence representation, and evidence representations offer a basis
    for knowledge representations that can enhance decision support research that
    aligns with geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) research [8]. A common
    long-held assumption is that improving data, information, evidence, knowledge,
    and wisdom-based representations as an ‘intelligence ramp’ will likely improve
    the characterization of complex system relationships, and therefore improve geodesign
    decision support applications [4]. We suggest that GeoAI research can be the next
    step to enhancing the development of a human–machine intelligence ramp for geodesign
    decision support. The next steps for developing a VRRSability intelligence ramp
    as a novel contribution to decision evaluation can take advantage of the three
    pillars of GeoAI technology, i.e., high-performance computing, machine learning,
    and geospatial big data [8]. Each of the three pillars will add a unique benefit
    to operational modeling as part of the next steps for VRRSability operationalization.
    For example, research about cyberinfrastructure-based geographic information systems
    (CyberGIS) [9], which involves high-performance computing and geospatial big data,
    partially motivated the creation of the MOESIR framework to organize issues about
    complex systems decision problems [4]. Technology perspectives from GeoAI will
    help extend developments for geodesign assessment, implementing VRRSability intelligence
    within decision evaluation as a key step within geodesign assessment of complex
    human–natural system problems. Conceptual frameworks about social–ecological (human–environment)
    systems assist with obtaining insight into the development of hypotheses and operational
    models [10,11]. As such, a VRRSability conceptual framework can organize relationships
    to improve our understanding of VRRSability and enhance prospects for specifying
    trade-offs among V-R-R-S decision objectives for improving spatial–temporal decision
    evaluation, particularly for improving decision support for participatory geodesign
    for ULWS [12,13]. To contextualize this synthesis research effort, we continue
    with an application of geodesign decision support for managing an ULWS, particularly
    low-impact development as part of GSI influences on water resource health as a
    sustainable system [2,4]. Functional performance of low-impact development is
    the ability of system elements in combination (e.g., for green infrastructure
    and water) to affect levels of service that foster well-being [7]. Focusing on
    functional performance relationships within systems enables people to examine
    various behaviors of complex systems, including those described in terms of any
    one of the V-R-R-S concepts, but particularly those in combination using VRRSability
    decision objectives. Functional performance emerges from multiple interacting
    factors, with some of them controlling variables (stressors) and others deemed
    variables reflecting change (often thought of as receptors) [14]. The behaviors
    of these factors are at play in physical, social, and social–physical systems,
    whether we refer to such systems as coupled natural–human systems, social–ecological
    systems, human–environment systems, hazard–receptor systems or nature–society
    systems, all of which take on some form of a sustainable system over the long-term
    [4]. In a geodesign workflow, intelligence insight is built by using an information
    gain and abstraction strategy by traversing six steps of modeling, often using
    model iteration. In brief, geodesign decision support involves three steps of
    assessment and three steps of intervention [13], wherein assessment results inform
    intervention strategies. A geodesign assessment workflow consists of representation,
    process, and evaluation modeling; assessment is a process that results in characterizing
    conditions of a problem from which appropriate solution options can be designed.
    A geodesign intervention workflow consists of design, impact, and choice modeling,
    in which intervention is a process that results in a choice for action. The research
    question calls out the geodesign assessment step involving evaluation modeling
    because evaluation results are the key input to a geodesign intervention workflow,
    and the basis of impact modeling. The geodesign model (i.e., information) embedding
    strategy, referred to as information gain with information abstraction, was adopted
    for use in the MOESIR framework. As such, Tier 1 information about elements of
    a system is embedded within Tier 2 V-R-R-S evaluative information; consequently,
    Tier 2 layer extends the information of Tier 1 with an evaluative context. Tier
    2 evaluative information is embedded within Tier 3 workflow information, wherein
    Tier 3 extends Tier 2 with how-to-measure information and work with evaluative
    information. Tier 3 decision support workflow information is embedded within Tier
    4 application implementation information, i.e., how to compute evaluative information
    about GSI. This research clarifies Tier 2 VRRSability evaluative information,
    thus clarifying Tier 1 system information from previous research plus Tier 3 computational
    workflow information supporting Tier 4 application information about GSI. All
    four tiers together are required for the implementation of VRRSability in geodesign
    decision support. This paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we elucidate
    numerous relations among research publications about V-R-R-S syntheses with the
    potential to further elucidate VRRSability at MOESIR Tier 2. We synthesize a VRRSability
    conceptual framework using the relevant concepts, components, sub-components,
    and relationships. In Section 3, we present an application (MOESIR Tier 4) of
    ULWS as a social-ecological system. This information context focuses on a chain
    of relationships about land cover influencing water resource health (water flow
    and quality) and habitat condition in Puget Sound, while adopting Tier 2 VRRSability
    and Tier 3 geodesign workflow considerations to frame the application. Section
    4 explores VRRSability as decision evaluation trade-offs among the V-R-R-S concepts
    together with the details of the components, using the functional performance
    of green stormwater infrastructure as the application context. Section 5 presents
    a discussion about decision trade-offs. We conclude in Section 6 by highlighting
    knowledge contributions and offering directions for VRRSability operationalization,
    with a particular focus on GeoAI research for enhancing geodesign decision support.
    2. Geospatial Ontology for Decision Evaluation In the MOESIR framework, Tier 2
    evaluation ontology overlays the Tier 1 descriptive ontology to characterize sustainable
    system well-being. The singular V-R-R-S decision evaluation concepts, synthesized
    into the overarching VRRSability concept, contain evaluative relationships, e.g.,
    about sensitivity, harm, improvement, and/or longevity (respectively), which provide
    insight into decision evaluation trade-offs about the health and well-being of
    complex systems. To initiate characterization of relationships among V-R-R-S concepts,
    we first identify variables with units of measure for the sub-components of GSI
    systems. We then turn to enumerating potential relationships among V-R-R-S using
    a Venn diagram approach and demonstrate why table-based analytical enumeration
    is a superior approach. From insights into the differences between information
    structures, we chose to enumerate a collection of seven approaches for depicting
    a conceptual framework. We explain why a box–relation diagram approach is the
    most appropriate for our purpose. We then organize the V-R-R-S concepts into a
    VRRSability conceptual framework using a box–relation approach. From there, we
    “drill down” into the core relationship of the framework, using the concept of
    functional performance to further explore relationships about sensitivity, harm,
    improvement, and longevity of sustainable system well-being. 2.1. MOESIR Tier
    2 Using VRRSability for Decision Evaluation As mentioned earlier, previous research
    about decision support for complex systems identified a need for synthesis of
    V-R-R-S concepts that could enhance participatory evaluation of decision support
    trade-offs [2]. Although resilience and sustainability are the more comprehensive
    concepts in contrast to vulnerability and risk, none of the four concepts individually
    provide an overarching focus through which decision trade-offs could be managed
    easily. VRRSability as an overarching concept offers a way to operationalize trade-offs
    [6], but details about the relationships among sub-components are needed for making
    VRRSability operational. Based on previous research that offered a textual narrative
    for each of the V-R-R-S concepts and thirteen components and published by IJGI
    in 2021 [6], here we list the respective components of V-R-R-S concepts as a start
    to the analytical operationalization of VRRSability (Table 1). Note that the terms
    concepts and components are intentionally different for uniquely identifying the
    two lists. Components are meant to ‘specialize’ concepts and subcomponents specialize
    components from a data modeling perspective. Table 1. VRRSability components detailed
    as measurable variables. Italics signifies the best elucidation of a measurable
    variable relative to other expressions in the row, and thus the basis of entry
    in the VRRSability column at right side of table. At this point, we offer a brief
    summary of the research workflow that led to the articulation and elucidation
    of the thirteen components with associated subcomponents, contributing to the
    veracity of this particular list of components. We started with the individual
    V-R-R-S concepts, identifying internationally published handbooks and/or papers
    containing one or more of the concepts as presented in [6]. We searched for handbook
    sources listing two or more of the concepts, as such inclusion indicated recognition
    of a broader topic treatment. At least three definitions for each concept were
    enlisted for content analysis. Using those definitions we performed a content
    analysis of phrases, iterating until all definitions were parsed completely into
    components. We compared and contrasted the phrases to identify commonalty, enumerating
    a comprehensive and unique collection of five conceptual components. The components
    include the following: (1) elements such as stressors or receptors, (2) functional
    performance related to exposure between the stressors/receptors, (3) dose–response
    thresholds associated with functional performance, (4) management actions based
    on decision evaluation, and (5) functional performance outcomes such as harm or
    improvement of well-being. The second major step involved identifying V-R-R-S
    references. We used Google Scholar to retrieve reference citations based on all
    combinations of V-R-R-S, discovering that the order of concepts in the query mattered
    when retrieving references. More than 100 references were identified. We then
    started with the five conceptual components to identify a collection of other
    (one might say secondary, but important) components. A total of thirteen unique
    conceptual components plus seven associated sub-components were identified through
    multiple iterations to foster consistency of interpretation and gather corroborating
    evidence about the components across the published works. A complete enumeration
    together with all reference citations associated with each component and sub-component
    appears in the earlier publication [6]. One of the principal recommendations for
    next-step research to that list of components included identifying and elucidating
    concept and component relations as provided within this paper. Each of the V-R-R-S
    concepts contain a collection of components from among thirteen VRRSability components
    (a–m) as listed in Table 1 in column 1. Nine components characterize vulnerability,
    ten components characterize risk, twelve components characterize resilience, and
    eleven components characterize sustainability (Table 1 column headings). Although
    thirteen components of VRRSability fully describe the concept, several sub-components
    are needed for operationalizing the treatment of components. Although we address
    the full application in Section 3, here we introduce domain specificity to describe
    the components (a–m) using the ULWS context focusing on GSI. The GSI domain context
    offers the reader information on how and why all the components a–m are important
    as a basis for identifying and elucidating relations among the components from
    a practical application perspective. As such, the entries in Table 1 columns 2–5
    suggest a collection of data needs that can be useful for model operationalization
    once the research achieves this level of specificity. Note that the duplication
    of component entries among the columns highlight the commonalty of components
    among V-R-R-S concepts, which suggests that a core set of computations underlie
    the overarching concept of VRRSability as a synthesis among V-R-R-S concepts.
    Identifying the best elucidation of components as a variable description (in italic
    font) offers initial insight into how each of the V-R-R-S concepts can contribute
    to VRRSability synthesis (in the last column). 2.2. Articulating Relationships
    among V-R-R-S Concepts Previous research [6] did not enumerate relationships among
    the four V-R-R-S concepts, let alone the thirteen components (and respective sub-components)
    composing VRRSability. Two levels of relationships were identified. The first
    are relationships among V-R-R-S, while the second are relationships among all
    thirteen components and respective sub-components. The V-R-R-S relationships formed
    from combinations of V-R-R-S concepts are more general in character than the relationships
    among components because the former is somewhat context-free, whereas the latter
    assumes a context about complex systems. However, both levels contribute to a
    comprehensive conceptual framework of VRRSability, and each offers insight for
    making VRRSability operational. While all the V-R-R-S concepts are important to
    consider, just how each is related to another presents a challenge, and how each
    of the thirteen components (and sub-components) relate to one another adds further
    complexity. This section about enumerating and elucidating concept and component
    relationships addresses a second clause within the research question. A Venn diagram
    helps to enumerate the relations between and among the four V-R-R-S concepts and
    depict them for ease of understanding (Figure 1 and Figure 2). Figure 1 and Figure
    2 show two ways to treat the combinations. Figure 1 depicts combinations wherein
    precedence order does not matter in the combinations, i.e., all the concepts are
    treated as nouns and as such, any ordering of the same collection of V-R-R-S would
    convey the same character of relationships. Figure 2 uses order to characterize
    relationships, wherein the ordering takes on a particular interpretation using
    adjectival precedence; thus, the last concept is the noun and the preceding concepts
    are adjectives. All combinations of adjectives should be described or the order
    could be misleading, at least initially. The main point of the difference in Figure
    1 and Figure 2 is that they depict very different kinds of meaningful V-R-R-R
    concept relations. Nonetheless, after composing several versions, we discovered
    that a 2D Venn diagram cannot show all combinations of four concepts, no matter
    if the order is relevant or not. Although three circles can show all nine combinations
    of three concepts, four circles portraying combinations of four concepts prohibit
    two of the overlaps from being shown within any 2D display, no matter the configuration
    of the circles. The configuration in Figure 1 does not depict the sustainability–risk
    and vulnerability–resilience combinations. Similarly, the configuration in Figure
    2 is missing the adjectival description of those two combinations. We assume that
    it would take a 3D diagram to show all combinations of the four concepts, for
    which a dynamic software application would be helpful. Nonetheless, the 2D rendition
    is useful for synoptic portrayal, and the enhancement to a 3D diagram is left
    for future research. Figure 1. Synthesizing vulnerability (Vul), risk (Risk),
    resilience (Res), and sustainability (sus) in a Venn diagram shows nine of eleven
    combinations of concepts; Vul-Res and Risk-Sus cannot be depicted when using four
    concept circles in this manner, as a third concept Sus for Vul-Res, and Res for
    Vul should be included with Risk-Sus. Figure 2. V-R-R-S Venn diagram depicting
    commonalty among vulnerability, risk, resilience and sustainability using adjectival
    precedence to describe concepts. Recognizing the limitation of 2D Venn diagrams
    for our purpose, and having a list of all combinations of V-R-R-S concepts, we
    concluded that a table would enumerate the complete list of eleven combinations
    of V-R-R-S concepts as binary, ternary, and quad-nary combinations (Table 2, column
    1), plus offer a means to describe them. Comparing and contrasting the potential
    of Venn diagrams and tables, we used this insight about information structuring
    (of synoptics and analytics) for exploring different ‘expression conventions’
    that characterize relations among the thirteen components, seeking full enumeration,
    synoptic portrayal, and analytic detail of relations. A literature review (see
    references in Table 2, column 3) identified seven conventions, each expressing
    a different information structuring capability, including: O: operational expression,
    G: graph diagram (between two variables), M: map display, B: box-relation diagram,
    V: Venn diagram, T: table list of enumerated characteristics, and N: narrative
    (Table 2, column 2 and legend). These conventions are listed in order of potential
    for analytic expression, and capability for providing both an overview and details
    of elements while clarifying the character of a relation. The list is ordered
    from the most robust (i.e., operational expressions suitable for modeling) to
    narrative (i.e., textual description within paragraphs) to describe relationships
    among information elements (i.e., components). Table 2. Conceptual frameworks
    across vulnerability, risk, resilience, and sustainability. Operational expression,
    graph, and map display information structures provide a basis for data structures
    within models, and thus are commonly more detailed than conceptual frameworks.
    Although those information structures will eventually be significant for research
    about VRRSability modeling, our main interest is in developing a robust conceptual
    framework before addressing logical modeling as discussed previously [6]. Consequently,
    graphs, box–relation diagrams, Venn diagrams, tables, and narratives provide the
    best source for an information structure approach to compose a conceptual framework.
    We used those expression conventions to perform a meta-content analysis of the
    literature. Within each publication listed in Table 2, column 3, we identified
    the types of information structuring used as part of their contribution listed
    in Table 2, column 2. Readers might question the validity of the list of information
    structure entries within Table 2, i.e., whether each entry is accurately listed,
    and how significantly each entry might influence the overall research findings.
    The selection of the entries represented a pre-screening of the literature references
    as an intermediate finding, i.e., the entries offer nominal insight about possible
    considerations only. As such, Table 2 entries indicate the existence of information
    structures within specific references merely for later consideration. Identifying
    and characterizing one type of information structure in contrast to another is
    a matter of interpretation, based on expertise of those developing and interpreting
    such expressions. Since the lead author made all the interpretations, there is
    internal consistency with the listed entries. In brief, the principal form and
    function of each acted as a selection guideline as follows. Operational models
    characterize functional relationships most easily translated into methods and
    data structures in programming languages. Graphs portray trends between ranges
    of numbers, even when the ranges are abstractions. Maps are multidimensional characterizations
    of relations using world space and time as foundational domains. Box–relation
    diagrams emphasize connections (relations) among conceptual components (boxes).
    Venn diagrams as graphic portrays of information demonstrate nominal commonalty
    as the basis of relations, wherein overlapping areas depict similar content. Tables
    combine a list of primary entities (rows) and a list of characteristics (columns),
    wherein the advantage is the complete enumeration of lists, providing exhaustive
    treatment of entities. Narratives offer descriptions of relations in a free-form
    textual manner. As mentioned above, we applied the guidelines loosely, emphasizing
    inclusion as opposed to exclusion of entries for any given information structure
    associated with a published work. This process provided a sufficiently large number
    of information structures and references within Table 2 for consultation during
    the next steps of the research process. Although differences among information
    structures are important, we again note that the focus of this research is about
    enumeration and synthesis of meaningful V-R-R-S concept relations associated with
    VRRSability as opposed to focusing on how one type of information structure is
    more advantageous than another. Table 2 helped us to identify which publications
    were the most salient for initiating work on a comprehensive VRRSability conceptual
    framework. Publications indicated with a plus (+) after the numbered reference
    in the table offer a particularly useful and explicit treatment of the VRRSability
    combinations, and thus provided special insight for framing a VRRSability synthesis,
    i.e., composing a conceptual framework. 2.3. Organizing V-R-R-S Components into
    a VRRSability Conceptual Framework While we could enumerate all the relationships
    among all the 13 components across V-R-R-S, and although it would require considerable
    time, the result would be difficult to comprehend. Thus, as per the list of components
    in Table 1, we start with the core components of ‘human’, ‘related to’, and ‘environment’,
    and associate other components previously identified to these three components.
    This makes sense because those same three components are part of the Tier 1 system
    description ontology. The V-R-R-S conceptual components in Table 1 (far-left column)
    reappear in Table 3 (far-left column). We focus on the articles that use box–relation
    diagram(s) portraying a conceptual framework as a guide for developing insights
    about conceptual components, emphasizing articles with a plus (+) in the far-right
    column of Table 2. We argue that a box–relation diagram provides fruitful insight
    for organizing and portraying concepts and conceptual relations from a synoptic
    perspective, as they are related to flow charts, systems diagrams, entity–relationship
    diagrams, and can include hierarchical nesting. A box–relation diagram is the
    most similar to an entity–relationship diagram as a compromise between text narratives
    and operational models for organizing multi-dimensional topics and relationships.
    From the overall collection of references with box–relation diagrams listed in
    Table 2, we provide the most comprehensive treatments (references) at the top
    of columns 2–6 of Table 3. This sub-collection offers a more focused exploration
    of the potential for enumerating the thirteen components. Relevant descriptions
    associated with each component appear as row entries across columns 2–6 of Table
    3. Table 3. VRRSability components compared and contrasted from selected conceptual
    frameworks. V-R-R-S entries within Table 3 row with reference citations indicate
    the V-R-R-S focus of the respective frameworks. None of the references treat all
    four V-R-R-S concepts explicitly in a comprehensive manner; some treat two and
    others treat three. The framework created by Turner et al. [57] focuses on vulnerability,
    while incorporating resilience and sustainability. The framework created by Birkmann
    et al. [69] focuses on vulnerability, while incorporating risk and sustainability.
    The framework created by Birkmann et al. [51] focuses on vulnerability, while
    incorporating risk and adaptation, with adaptation being a core action associated
    with resilience. The framework created by Lam et al. [24] focuses on resilience,
    while incorporating vulnerability and adaptation. The framework created by Linkov
    et al. [29] focuses on risk and resilience, but contextualizes that relationship
    with vulnerability. The frameworks created by Lam et al. [24] and Linkov et al.
    [29] guide computational approaches that support the identification and use of
    methods, techniques, and tools for the respective concepts, but neither of them
    treats computational sustainability. Row entries for the components (a–m) within
    Table 3 across columns 2–6 provide an overview of how each component is treated
    within the respective publication. Having already synthesized twenty components
    into thirteen main components (labels a–m) and seven sub-components (labels with
    letter–integer combinations) appearing in Table 1, we compared the entries to
    form conceptual component relationships. The row entries depicted with bold-faced
    font signify explicit consideration for inclusion in the syntheses within a VRRSability
    conceptual framework (Figure 3). The VRRSability framework is depicted as a box–relation
    diagram, which shows the resulting relationships among the components/subcomponents
    using text label codes within parentheses. No doubt there are other aspects of
    each component of the conceptual framework, but the framework depicts the salient
    relationships among the components. The relationships suggest the most interesting
    aspects of the framework for further investigation. Such investigation draws from
    insights about the variables offered in Table 1 about GSI, requiring variables
    for each of the components/sub-components, and focusing on a GSI core relationship
    to start. Figure 3. VRRSability conceptual framework for synthesizing perspectives
    on vulnerability, risk, resilience, and sustainability about human–environment,
    social–ecological and natural–human systems. 2.4. Exploring VRRSability Using
    Functional Performance as a Core Relationship A functional performance relationship
    (center of Figure 3, i.e., a1 ← b1,2 → a2) within an integrated system involves
    several sub-components, including human (social, economic, cultural, and institutional
    conditions) elements (stressor label a1 and receptor label a2), interacting through
    exposure (label b, b1, b2) with environmental (physical and ecological) elements.
    Turner et al. [57] describe human–environment systems in terms of interacting
    human elements and environmental elements situated within potentially vulnerable
    places associated with the core of the conceptual framework. Space–time collocation,
    i.e., more specifically impact envelopes, often referred to as the exposure (b)
    of stressors (a1) and receptors (a2), is a key relation of the conceptual framework.
    Exposure pathways (label b1) between stressors and receptors as a sequence of
    collocations (impacts) take the form of event occurrences (label b2). These event
    occurrences pair stressor and receptors at different sensitivities based on various
    dose–response thresholds (label c) for the stressor–receptor combinations [24,51]
    through spatial–temporal dimensions. Lam et al. [24] link receptor exposure and
    receptor damage using a vulnerability relationship. Birkmann [69] explicitly recognizes
    hazard (stressor) event occurrences as the precursor to vulnerability that motivates
    exposure with a given set of receptors. Birkmann et al. [51] further explain that
    recognition by classifying hazards into natural and socio-natural events. Turner
    et al. [57] outline human and environmental sensitivity levels, with these sensitivity
    levels being associated with various dose–response thresholds (c1). Units of measurement
    are fundamental for more precise characterization of functional performance, which
    is commonly measured on an ordinal level for vulnerability and sustainability
    [15,23,57], or on interval or ratio levels for risk and resilience [17,27,50],
    although intervals–ratios can be reduced to ordinals. Ganin et al. [27], Lam et
    al. [24], and Linkov et al. [26] present characterizations of functional performance
    using units of measurement within the context of vulnerability, risk, and resilience,
    without treating sustainability. We draw from their work and expand the treatment
    of V-R-R, adding sustainability of functional performance over the long term to
    a functional relation (Figure 4). Vulnerability is seen to be a part of risk (vulnerability
    is referenced within the concept of risk); the higher the vulnerability, the higher
    the risk associated with an event. Risk, as the probability of harm, is seen as
    the drop in functional performance from a level (be it ideal or satisfactory)
    in the time interval measured as the area between TEB and TRE (i.e., TRE − TEB),
    above the minimum level [17,50]. Generally, resilience has an inverse relationship
    to risk, and is measured as the area under the performance curve. However, locations
    (organizations) around the world will respond differently to in situ conditions
    given human, financial, and ecosystem resource availability; thus, curve shapes
    have an in situ context. We also note that vulnerability is also part of resilience,
    but in an inverse way: the lower the vulnerability, the greater the resilience.
    Sustainability takes a long-term perspective in the diagram; it incorporates much
    of resilience (area under the curve), but extends the area to time TRP, which
    then would cycle through multiple time periods. The work of Linkov et al. [29]
    extends the work of Linkov et al. [26] by recognizing acceptable and unacceptable
    levels of damage based on thresholds at local, regional, and global levels. It
    is these ‘informed’ levels of performance that underlay the meaning of ideal,
    satisfactory, and minimum, all of which are interpreted in terms of thresholds
    as in the resilience literature [14]. Figure 4. Functional performance levels
    regarding the V-R-R-S time points of an event. The performance curve provides
    insight into the timeframes associated with management actions (d) that result
    in certain impacts (e) as portrayed in Figure 3. Management actions to plan, absorb,
    recover, or adapt functional performance are associated with different timeframes
    as depicted in Figure 4. Although functional performance over time is important
    to track, understanding functional performance as a relation of stressors to receptors
    is just as important; Figure 4 does not characterize that insight about different
    types of functional performance influences. Walker and Salt [14] outline four
    types of relation (herein, we interpret them as functional performance) diagrams
    for characterizing relationships between stressors as controlling variables and
    receptors as variables of change (Figure 5). Using the idea of sensitivity within
    resilience relationships, we refer to performance thresholds as ‘tipping points’
    within the relation [14]. Figure 5. Four functional profiles between a stressor
    (controlling) variable and a receptor variable of change) demonstrating dose–response
    sensitivity thresholds, also called tipping points (based on diagrams in [14]).
    The four types of conditions likely require different management actions (d) depending
    on the availability and adequacy of evaluation information, particularly from
    a resilience perspective involving space–time dynamics with feedback. Whether
    a management action occurs or not, an impact (e) is likely to occur, e.g., as
    in parts per million of water contamination to a measured degree above a regulated
    standard or land flooding to a measured height in inches/feet above the flood
    stage. Whether such impacts in the short term or long term are managed properly
    addresses concerns about sustainability. In addition to different management actions,
    each of the sensitivity situations can be characterized in terms of different
    scenarios (f), each formed from a collection of conditions addressing components
    (a–e), which can help enrich relational perspectives. Natural processes work at
    different scales, e.g., global regions of warming oceans and cooling oceans influence
    low and high pressure, respectively, which in turn influence wind patterns, which
    in turn influence precipitation patterns directly related to stormwater. More
    widespread and longer-lasting and/or more intense precipitation events together
    with local conditions of elevation changes influence stormwater flow, often resulting
    in flooding at national and regional scales, although national does not necessarily
    imply a geo-political-oriented scale. We extend the functional performance treatment
    to address scenario conditions, based in part on suggestions by Linkov et al.
    [26]. We identify four main types of scenarios based on the collections of conditions
    that result in different risk and resilience circumstances (Figure 6). Everyday
    normal scenarios involve conditions with a low risk with expected high resilience
    because the challenges are small. Acute scenarios involve conditions with a high
    risk with high resilience; the challenges do not occur often, but are reasonably
    well-known and people can prepare for these circumstances because resources are
    available and attention is high. Chronic scenarios involve conditions with a low
    risk and low resilience from circumstances that are continually at hand; resources
    are minimal and spread across a long time-period. Catastrophic scenarios involve
    conditions with a high risk and low resilience; the conditions seldom occur, are
    hard to predict, and therefore, recovery takes a long time, if it can occur at
    all, given the circumstances. When recovery is long and difficult, a new stable
    state can arise more easily, involving degraded performance over time, e.g., as
    depicted in Figure 5d. Although scenario types are generalizations, providing
    a rough idea of circumstances that can occur from time to time, they are useful
    because they synthesize a collection of conditions for ease of discussion. Figure
    6. Different scenario conditions commonly associated with different functional
    performance curve shapes (adapted after [26]). Turner et al. [57] note the importance
    of scenarios for investigating vulnerability (sensitivity conditions) and resilience
    (response to hazards) within human–environment systems; units of measurements
    take the form of human-contextual and environmental-contextual conditions. Birkmann
    et al. [51] consider a variety of dimensions based on physical, ecological, social,
    economic, cultural, and institutional conditions for all four V-R-R-S concepts,
    with these dimensions measured to set specific features, conditions and events
    that contextualize the relation a1 → a2. Different features, conditions, and events
    occur at diverse local, regional, national, and global scales (label g) because
    every scenario is scale-dependent. Turner et al. [57] describe spatial, temporal,
    and functional scales, as shown in Figure 3, using embedded scales (box frames),
    which infer relative sizes (spatial extents) of areas. Spatial and temporal dimensions
    characterize feature attribute scales, i.e., attribute scales follow from space–time
    scales. Together, spatial-, temporal- and attribute-scale dimensions create a
    functional scale; that is, functional scales follow from attribute conditions,
    associated with space–time scales. Birkmann et al. [51] enumerate local, sub-national
    (aka regional), national, and international areal scales to embed functional relationships
    characterizing human–environment (e.g., people → land development → water) interactions.
    Due to different scales, we recognize different levels of resolution (label h)
    for events and conditions within diverse social, economic, cultural, institutional,
    physical, and ecological domains. Land resolution in terms of land parcels provides
    an institutional perspective as opposed to characterizing acres (or hectares)
    for land and acre-feet for water. Turner et al. [57] embed human–environment relationships
    within place, regional, and global scales, suggesting that scales and the features
    therein are each associated with finer to more coarse levels of resolution, i.e.,
    individuals, groups, communities, states, or nations. Controlling variables as
    stressors and variables of concern as receptors require expression at specific
    levels of resolution, with finer levels of resolution providing better feature
    articulation of interaction relationships. Furthermore, Birkmann et al. [51] describe
    the susceptibility and fragility of conditions in terms of physical, ecological,
    social, economic, cultural, and institutional dimensions, and as such, resolution
    of the relation for susceptibility associated with vulnerability and fragility
    associated with resilience rely upon fine to coarse units of resolution for articulation
    of these relationships. Scenario considerations, with appropriate scales (spatial
    extents of areas) and resolutions (unit of observables within those areas), guide
    the selection of stressor and receptor features, conditions, and events that underpin
    functional performance. For example, controlling variables as stressors (such
    as land as label a1) influence variables of concern as receptors (such as water
    with label a2) over space–time horizons [14]. Turner et al. [57] and Birkmann
    et al. [51] both describe hazards as being human and/or natural–environmental
    sourced (i.e., a1 or a2). Turner et al. [57] describe the variability and change
    in human conditions as the basis of variables of concern as receptors. Following-up
    on a previous characterization of functional performance [26], Linkov et al. [29]
    describe three tiers of assessment for functional performance relationships, considering
    different levels of resolution for elements participating in these relationships.
    Feedback (i) from causal influences is critical for understanding functional performance
    sensitivities, particularly regarding reactions associated with tipping points.
    Feedback loops commonly create tipping points, causing systems to flip into a
    different state as a reaction [14]. Turner et al. [57] suggest that nested spatial–temporal
    scales are important for clarifying the different levels of resolution involved
    with feedback. Birkmann [69] recognizes the importance of feedback from events
    that foster successive rounds of (re)action. Once insight about the interactions
    and the frames of reference that guide them is obtained, we can expand the perspective
    to examine agency (directed motivation) when taking action (label d1) implemented
    through social empowerment (label d2) and governmental (label d3) approaches.
    Birkmann et al. [51] reference risk governance regarding ‘human agency’ as motivation
    to act for improvement, and we recognize that this perspective extends to VRRSability
    governance. Regulatory contexts situate the importance of social empowerment in
    risk assessment [73], now extending to risk and resilience [29], both showing
    a need for practical methods and tools for performing assessments. Birkmann et
    al. [51] mention the importance of societal empowerment in addressing vulnerability.
    Lam et al. [24] enumerates many geodemographic variables suitable for characterizing
    social empowerment. VRRSability evaluation, as a third step within geodesign VRRSability
    assessment, provides information insights for management intervention actions
    (label d). Social empowerment infuses stakeholder perspectives with diversifying
    perspectives on decision priorities (label e1). Turner et al. [57] describe place-based
    adjustments including coping and adaptation as responses to vulnerability. Birkmann
    et al. [51] describe how hazard intervention and vulnerability (and by extension
    VRRSability) intervention as adaptation (management action) can lead to risk reduction,
    while vulnerability intervention includes exposure reduction, susceptibility reduction,
    and resilience improvement. Resilience improvement could include increasing capacities
    for mitigation (planning before disturbance events), coping (acting during disturbance
    events) and recovery (efforts after disturbance events). Birkmann [69] describes
    intervention systems that can address vulnerability threats. Linkov et al. [29]
    outline decision priorities that foster choices about interventions based on evaluation
    of damage thresholds. Decision priorities use guidelines from evaluation as they
    apply to potentially desired and undesired impact outcomes (e2), remembering that
    all components together interact to influence priority of outcomes. Thus, geodesign
    evaluation feeds forward when considering geodesign alternatives, each with various
    associated impacts. All frameworks consider impacts (degradations or improvements)
    at various levels of detail. Turner et al. [57] describe impacts as consequences
    in response to hazards. Birkmann [69] describes impacts within contexts of risk
    reduction and resilience improvement. Birkmann et al. [51] describe impacts within
    a context of risk reduction. Lam et al. [24] describe impacts within a context
    of vulnerability reduction. Linkov et al. [29] describe impacts within the contexts
    of risk reduction and vulnerability improvement. Birkmann [69], Lam et al. [24],
    and Schultz and Smith [28] consider impacts within multiple cycles over time,
    which aligns with emergency management life cycles. Different circumstances of
    human–environment conditions lead to alternate stable states (label j): some preferred
    and others not preferred. Birkmann [69] and Walker and Salt [14] describe alternate
    state conditions in relation to thresholds that create alternate stable states
    of world conditions. Empowerment often involves social learning for setting directions
    that influence conditions (label k). Although that sub-component is not recognized
    explicitly within any framework, it is important to include it in the VRRSability
    framework because people within institutions act as agents of change. Information
    technology-based knowledge systems can enhance learning to foster social empowerment
    and effectiveness of management actions (label l). Knowledge-based systems embedded
    within geographic information systems are useful for exploring VRRSability to
    support structural change [52,74]. Organizing many of the above components for
    fostering structural change can enhance sustainable development (label e3), wherein
    long-term structural change called ‘transformation’ leads to sustained functional
    performance over the long term [64]. Correspondingly, recognition of resilience
    cycles over time will foster sustainable development over the long term [24,69,71].
    Turner et al. [57] recognize the importance of tools, but do not cite any references
    since their framework was an early treatment of V-R-R-S concepts. Birkmann et
    al. [51] describe tools and measurements (label m) that can be key to implementing
    software for assessing vulnerability, risk, and adaptation. Lam et al. [24] implemented
    computer methods for estimating resilience with subcomponents of vulnerability
    and adaptation using data at county levels along the US Gulf of Mexico. Linkov
    et al. [29] compare risk and resilience assessment methods to show that they are
    complementary to each other, and suggest how software tools could also be complementarity
    if implemented appropriately. With the above insights in mind, we now turn to
    outlining a VRRSability application focusing on functional performance evaluation
    of GSI. 3. VRRSability Evaluation of Green Stormwater Infrastructure Functional
    Performance In this section, we use the findings from the MOESIR Tiers 1–3, including
    the VRRSability synthesis elucidated above, for articulating a case study example
    focusing on the functional performance of GSI. Eckart et al. [7] investigate the
    functional performance of low-impact development (LID), and called for research
    on GSI decision evaluation at watershed and regional scales. Their research identifies
    several LID alternatives that perform various functions for returning stormwater
    runoff to the natural hydrologic cycle, including (1) a reduction in surface water
    runoff volume, (2) infiltration improvement, (3) a reduction in peak flow, (4)
    extending lag time reduction in pollutant loads, and (5) an increase in baseflow
    [7]. Each of those five functional performance behaviors contributes to a level
    of ‘functional performance’ for improving water flow and quality. The GSI example
    described herein adopts this perspective on water-focused GSI functional performance
    as an important focus within a ULWS, while treating the other components as needed.
    The GSI example provides a proof-of-concept application toward making MOESIR Tiers
    1–4 operational across various scales. This functional performance relationship
    is key to our GSI example, whether one examines two or more individual system
    elements, two or more subsystems within an individual system, or two or more interconnected
    systems. Regardless of the level of aggregation, GSI functional performance is
    at the core of ULWS relationships. Land–water relationships include components
    of land (a1), water (a2), land–water relationships (b1) and surge occurrences
    (b2), together with the resulting impacts (e1), e.g., degradation of the land
    or the water resource, for a1 or a2, whichever is relevant for the focus of functional
    performance. The direction of influence is important when characterizing the relation
    (i.e., arrows that depict interaction among elements). For example, the interaction
    between land (a1) → water (a2) would involve land cover (a1) as a stressor and
    water (a2) as a receptor. Alternatively, the interaction between water (a1) →
    land (a2) would involve water as a stressor (flood conditions) and land as a receptor
    (infiltration conditions). For both cases, dose–response sensitivity thresholds
    (c) are associated with each interaction. Water can suspend only so much contaminant
    material, e.g., phosphorous, nitrogen, or sediment with or without heavy metals(s).
    Alternatively, land can become saturated to a level wherein additional water causes
    flooding. Places are potentially vulnerable depending on the collocation of exposure
    and levels of influence, but specific measurements such as hectares (acres) of
    land and cubic feet (acre-feet) of water are required for the computation of risk
    probability. As mentioned in the introduction, let us consider the water resource
    assessment of the Puget Sound Characterization (PSC) conducted by the Washington
    State Department of Ecology [74]. The geographic information system-enabled (GIS)
    multi-scale approach that addresses all nineteen watersheds within the Puget Sound
    basin represents a comprehensive water resource assessment of the regional resource.
    The assessment is part of the Puget Sound Partnership effort to understand land–water
    dynamics at multiple spatial and temporal scales, focusing on the influence of
    water flow on quality plus fish and wildlife habitats; the GIS data are available
    on the Washington Ecology GIS website [75]. The assessments examine water flow
    (WF), water quality (WQ) and habitat condition (HC). WF is of critical functionality
    within the water system in Puget Sound basin as it influences WQ and HC, particularly
    in relation to the health of salmon populations. The WF, WQ, and HC assessments
    include variables that combine with their respective functional performance levels.
    Considering a causality chain, WQ and HC functional performance stem from WF functional
    performance. Furthermore, the WF assessment points out that WF is a function of
    rainfall (RF) and land cover imperviousness (LCI), and the infiltration relationship
    between RF and LCI. From the assessed levels of functional performance for WF,
    WQ, and HC, the PSC team recommended water resource planning strategies for local
    governments. Surprisingly, a text string search of the PSC volume 1 document (.pdf
    format) did not find explicit use of any V-R-R-S concepts. However, a search of
    other terms (e.g., water and assessment, etc.) did return results. Nonetheless,
    because the PSC report subtitle is “water resource assessments” and focuses on
    the importance and degradation of WF, WQ, and HC, we surmise that most researchers
    and practitioners would agree that V-R-R-S evaluations, and hence the VRRSability
    conceptual framework, could provide important evaluative information within V-R-R-S
    assessments. Furthermore, operationalizing VRRSability is possible only if all
    V-R-R-S components can be made operational. With WF being the most critical subsystem
    in relation to WQ and HC, space limitations encourage a focus on WF, while treating
    WQ and HC in relation to WF. The VRRSability components listed in Table 3 and
    relationships depicted within Figure 3 provide the basis for a functional performance
    relationship (a1 → b1 → a2) that characterizes GSI VRRSability more specifically
    (Figure 7). In the PSC report [74], WF functional performance is computed as a
    combination of two main conditions, landscape physiographic conditions contributing
    to the unaltered capacity of the WF regime, and degradation of the land cover,
    which reduces the capacity of the WF regime. As such, WF functional performance
    is the combination of the level of importance of the physiographic conditions
    that facilitates flow function plus the level of degradation to flow function
    due to land development. Figure 7. VRRSability of water flow (WF) and water quality
    (WQ) functional performance influenced by land-use land-cover (LULC) imperviousness.
    Letters a-l are V-R-R-S component labels. Detailing the WF regime, drainage analysis
    units (AUs) within the PSC watershed areas compose landscape groups with similar
    environmental characteristics, including precipitation, landform, and geology.
    The current version of model characterization includes landscape groups using
    geographical positions in terms of coastal, lowland, and mountain areas, plus
    a subset of lowland AUs that drain to one of four large lakes. In the models that
    assess AU importance, the study team compared AUs within landscape groups, but
    not between landscape groups. The PSC report states the following [74]: “The importance
    submodel evaluates each AU in its ‘unaltered’ state—that is, based on its physical
    attributes of topography, soils, geology, and hydrology, and without any consideration
    of land-use changes or human modifications that may have occurred. It considers
    four fundamental groups of water-flow processes: delivery, surface storage, movement
    (separated into recharge and discharge), and loss of water in each AU. The fundamental
    assumption is that different parts of the landscape have intrinsic differences
    in their importance for supporting natural volumes, rates, and timing of delivery,
    storage, movement, and loss. Those areas that are most essential to maintaining
    natural flow regimes will presumably be those areas most critical to the support
    of aquatic biota that have evolved in concert with these natural conditions”.
    [74] (p. 43) The PSC report also states the following: “The degradation submodel
    evaluates the watershed in its ‘altered’ state by considering the impact of human
    actions to the four water-flow processes (delivery, storage, movement, and loss)
    across all landscape groups. This evaluation is based on the magnitude of human-affected
    land cover (for the Puget Sound region, this is assumed to be all non-forest land,
    except those limited areas that are natural grassland), constructed infrastructure
    (roads and rooftops), and measures of consumptive water extraction and use”. [74]
    (p. 44) Based on the above narrative, the vulnerability of WF functional performance
    involves exposure to threats associated with sensitive conditions, e.g., the number
    of days without precipitation within a season. Dryness stems from the climate
    condition, which involves air and water circulation. WF functional performance
    is sensitive to the number of dry days, i.e., sensitivity increases when more
    than normal dry days occur. Vulnerability, in terms of exposure to dry conditions,
    would suppress WF functional performance. The risk of WF functional performance
    incorporates vulnerability, but the level of measurement is more refined, extending
    to a probability of harm resulting in damage to WF. Given a cycle of events within
    a season, we can compute the probability of damage to vegetation due to low water
    across a season, i.e., the risk of harm to vegetation increases when water availability
    decreases. This becomes an impact indicated on the right side of the LULC → WF
    interaction relationship depicted in the center of Figure 7. The probability of
    damage does not, however, offer insight about what to do to improve conditions,
    which is one reason for an emerging interest in resilience, shown on the left
    side of Figure 7. Resilience of WF functional performance focuses on the relationship
    between disturbance and improvements of functional performance conditions. In
    regard to functional performance, resilience is an inverse of risk; therefore,
    damage to functional performance plus remaining functional performance capacity
    equals total performance [26,27]. Resilience offers insight into the total capacity
    to respond to disturbances over time. Management action, in the form of LULC policy,
    is one such action, wherein these actions are often seasonal. Sustainability of
    WF functional performance focuses on maintaining a level of performance delivery
    satisfactory to all stakeholder groups over the long term (impacts on right side
    of Figure 7). Goal setting would be reasonable; goals and associated objectives
    are likely to involve decision trade-offs to maintain satisfactory functional
    performance, e.g., human drinking water, crop irrigation, and salmon habitats
    would involve many such trade-offs (priority settings on the left side of Figure
    7). Overtime, an amount of damage to performance (considering risk) plus the amount
    of performance capacity (considering resilience) equals the total satisfactory
    functional performance over time. Therefore, sustainable functional performance
    in relation to satisfactory functional performance might be higher, the same,
    or lower depending on extant conditions, e.g., within scenarios developed using
    various assumptions about space–time conditions at local and regional scales.
    The above considerations are helpful for distinguishing and relating the VRRSability
    components, providing a guide to making V-R-R-S concepts operational in an integrated
    manner. Within threshold diagrams of functional performance (e.g., Figure 5),
    time is assumed as the underlying relationship within the controlling variable;
    as such, the third dimension is assumed. Therefore, characterizing GSI functional
    performance, i.e., LULC imperviousness (in particular low-impact development)
    as a1 in association with functional performance of WF (a2), requires at least
    two 2D functional performance diagrams similar to Figure 4 because ‘time’ is the
    independent variable within the functional performance diagram. For a given amount
    of water, the magnitude of infiltration (different for various imperviousness
    surfaces) across the amount of land area influences the amount of water filtering
    through the soils for groundwater recharge or seepage back into watercourses.
    For a given amount of land, the magnitude of water influences the amount of (potential)
    flooding that will likely occur for that land area. There are threshold magnitudes
    for both land and water as part of a dose–response relationship that subsequently
    results in impacts from infiltration or flooding. Based on Figure 5, thresholds
    for dose-response and interaction during evaluation modeling of green infrastructure
    include the (sub) components c, d1, d2, d3 and e3. Depending on the magnitudes
    and timeframes as conditions, we might expect one or more of the scenarios to
    occur. Resources that commensurate with those conditions drive management actions
    for addressing conditions as less or more vulnerable, less or more risk prone,
    less or more resilient, and less or more sustainable; and together, these factors
    result in less or more VRRSability impacts. Based on Figure 6, operationalization
    (m) of VRRSability must include one or more scenarios (f) for contextualizing
    GSI decision evaluation modeling. Such scenarios specify space–time conditions,
    but not all conditions. Decision evaluation modeling must also include the other
    six contextual sub-components for particularizing situations, including the following:
    scale (g), resolution (h), feedback (i), alternate stable states (j), social learning
    (k), and knowledge systems (l). As mentioned earlier, scenarios at global to local
    scales include different forcing mechanisms for natural processes. As such, precipitation
    that causes stormwater can take on different spatial–temporal dynamics, wherein
    global processes of warmer oceans together with wind patterns can cause widespread
    and longer-lasting precipitation events across regions. Such large-scale events
    would encourage consideration of regional GSI development programs rather than
    single project activities. GSI investment programs as part of the more traditional
    capital investment in infrastructure programs are needed to address resilient
    and sustainable conditions. These six components represent a specification of
    social, economic, and physical conditions for contextualizing WF within a geographically
    based knowledge society. Each of the six components specify conditions of a particular
    situation needed for operationalizing VRRSability evaluation of GSI for watersheds.
    4. Trade-Offs within a Green Stormwater Infrastructure Decision Evaluation Changes
    in the conditions of complex human–environment systems over space and time encourage
    research into synthesis concepts about evaluating decision objective trade-offs
    that addresses the third and final clause within the research question. Elucidating
    all combinations of V-R-R-S and synthesizing them into a concept called VRRSability
    enables a wide-ranging perspective about what components and sub-components to
    consider within evaluation models. While the general overview of relationships
    is useful for understanding the scope of influences, drilling down into the details
    of the stressor–receptor functional performance relationship, i.e., a1 → b → a2,
    required several two-variable diagrams to characterize functional performance
    (as offered in Figure 4, Figure 5 and Figure 6). Four different scenarios of functional
    performance levels are provided in Figure 6, each offering a different shape of
    the curve, which show dramatic effects. When adding time into the functional relationship,
    as in Figure 6, we see that there are at least four possible scenarios. Factoring
    in Figure 5 relationships (stressors and receptors) and Figure 6 relationships
    (functional performance over time) results in at least 16 scenarios. Considering
    each of the V-R-R-S and VRRSability concepts, i.e., five concepts each applied
    to sixteen scenarios, results in eighty different scenarios. Such a conceptual
    enumeration begs for a computational approach, as a computational approach offers
    specificity for making decision objective trade-offs for any given application.
    Nonetheless, because a computational approach requires conceptual grounding, a
    narrative-based discourse of these concepts offers further clarification of the
    trade-offs as follows. Resilience (as depicted in Figure 4, Figure 5 and Figure
    6) offers a core (relationship) concept within VRRSability because resilience
    is an important quality for understanding improvement or degradation of well-being.
    The common dimension across Figure 4 and Figure 5 is functional performance, e.g.,
    the level of water flow improvement within a land–water GSI relationship. Units
    of measure for the dimensions of Figure 4 and Figure 5 can be implemented in both
    ordinal and interval–ratio terms. At present, they are characterized in ordinal
    terms. Measuring those dimensions is key to implementing VRRSability for decision
    objectives. Evaluation trade-offs for decision objectives, which relate the controlling
    variable to the variable of concern in Figure 5, are fundamental in forming GSI
    decision options. Characterizing evaluation trade-offs across time as depicted
    in Figure 6 is a further explication of decision options, but we must draw upon
    the relationships among V-R-R-S concepts if we are to understand trade-offs. For
    each of the four V-R-R-S concepts, consider the functional relationships among
    land cover, water flow, and water quality (LC → WF → WQ), wherein LC is the stressor
    and WF is the receptor for LC → WF, and WF is the stressor and WQ is the receptor
    for WF → WQ (See Table 4). Column 2 offers the unique character of each V-R-R-S
    concept described in terms of ‘sensitivity, harm, improvement and long-term well-being,
    respectively. Columns 3 and 4 present the stressor and receptor characterizations
    for LC → WF and WF → WQ, respectively. Column 5 presents the full functional performance
    relationship for LC → WF → WQ in the respective context. Table 4. V-R-R-S component
    relationships for land cover (LC), water flow (WF), and water quality (WQ) 1.
    The relationship of LC → WF → WQ (abbreviated as LC → WQ) functional performance
    is the basis for examining each of the V-R-R-S concepts in a pairwise manner (Figure
    8). Arraying VRRSability components in terms of dimensions helps characterize
    geodesign decision evaluation trade-offs regarding functional performance among
    pairs of V-R-R-S concepts. Dimensions range from the minimum (min) to maximum
    (max) for each of the four V-R-R-S concepts, wherein each dimension characterizes
    an aspect of functional performance. The characterization shown in Figure 8 depicts
    the complementarity and inverse relationships of the V-R-R-S concepts. Vulnerability
    and risk complement each other. Resilience and sustainability are complements
    to each other. Vulnerability and sustainability are inverses of one another. Risk
    and resilience are inverses to one another. As such, a position within the framework
    identifies a trade-off for both VUL-SUS and RISK-RES dimensions; assuming we hold
    the other dimension constant. A position along the VUL-SUS dimensions (vertical
    dimensions in figure) indicates a trade-off between harm sensitivity and maintaining
    well-being. Positions along the RISK-RES dimensions (horizontal dimensions in
    the figure) indicate a trade-off between harm impact and capability (capacity
    + ability) to maintain well-being. The center point intersection of dimensions
    identifies a ‘balanced position’ among all four components, which may or may not
    be a beneficial condition. A position at maximum sensitivity and maximum harm
    is a position corresponding to minimum resilience and minimum sustainability.
    In contrast, a position at minimum sensitivity and minimum harm corresponds to
    a position of maximum resilience and maximum sustainability. The descriptions
    within the four quadrants offer further insight into the relations among the V-R-R-S
    concepts in a binary manner. We note that the figure depicts general relationships
    among the components; thus, we must be cautious that some (desired) conditions
    in the world might encourage other interpretations. For example, annual flooding
    of the Snoqualmie River just east of Seattle, WA, encourages nutrient renewal
    on an annual basis, so what was generally considered a high risk can at times
    be beneficial (high as opposed to low resilience). However, a knowledge-based
    operational model can sort through such relationships, and remains a goal in future
    research. Figure 8. VRRSability dimensional (V-R-R-S) concepts depicting complementary
    and inverse relationships. Pair-wise relationships are useful, but VRRSability
    is composed of all four concepts. Thus, we use binary, ternary and quaternary
    relations of the concepts to understand the basis of trade-offs (Table 5 is a
    summary and Table A1 in Appendix A offers a full table). Reading through the tables,
    there is a ‘building block’ relationship among the V-R-R-S concepts. Note that
    the last row entry is V-R-R-S, i.e., VRRSability. All other rows offer ‘coded
    relations’, e.g., Vul-Risk-Res, for describing the concepts. As before, land cover
    (LC) in relation to water flow (WF) in relation to water quality (WQ) functional
    performance relationships (i.e., LC → WF → WQ abbreviated as LC → WQ) appear for
    each of the binary, ternary, quaternary V-R-R-S coded relations. Remember, WF
    is a receptor in the LC → WF relationship (Table A1, column 3), but is a stressor
    in the WF → WQ relationship (Table A1 column 4). A summary of the trade-offs for
    the land cover to water quality functional relationship (LC → WF → WQ) appears
    in column 3 (Table 5), and that same summary appears in column 5 (Table A1). All
    of the functional relationships can be used to guide decision evaluation trade-offs
    for each of the eleven coded relations, when such relations are relevant to decision
    negotiation. LC-type (LULC imperviousness) contingencies for WF are presented
    in Appendix A Table A1, columns 3 and 4, which is the primary reason the full
    table is more informative, and more useful when moving toward operationalization.
    Table 5. Summary of V-R-R-S binary, ternary, and quaternary relations for undergirding
    functional relationships among land cover (LC), water flow (WF), and water quality
    (WQ). Appendix A Table A1 offers a fully expanded version of Table 5. Acting as
    a guide for moving toward implementation of operational models, Table 2 enumerates
    several approaches to operational models for combinations of V-R-R-S addressing
    trade-offs, although none of them treat all four concepts that demonstrate evaluation
    trade-offs. Nonetheless, the several combinations of two and three concepts can
    provide a solid next step when considering the enumeration of relationships as
    per Table 5. For example, mathematical operational models are published for combinations
    of Vul-Risk about social–ecological systems [16] and safety within hazardous systems
    [17]. Although Aven’s [17] approach is the more complete of the two, unfortunately
    neither is spatially explicit. Vul-Risk in Table 5 shows that a spatial–temporal
    explicit approach to land and water systems is necessary. A statistical spatially
    explicit operational model of the U.S. Gulf Coast exists for the combination of
    Vul-Res [24]; although it is temporally explicit, the temporality is limited.
    A geodesign operational model exists for Vul-Sus [2], but trade-offs between GSI
    scenarios are not treated in an explicit manner. Operational models combining
    trade-offs between Risk-Res include a mathematical model [27], a multicriteria
    decision model [30], and a spatially explicit simulation model [31]. Combining
    those three approaches offers valuable insight for integrating all combinations
    of V-R-R-S. Operational models combining trade-offs between Res-Sus include a
    spatially explicit statistical model for social–ecological systems [37,38] and
    composite indicator models for wastewater management [45]. Composite indicators
    offer a simple but effective approach for providing insights about functional
    performance levels. Operational models combining trade-offs among Vul-Risk-Res
    include a mathematical approach for earthquake seismic concerns [46], a qualitative
    approach to social concerns in social–ecological systems [59], and a general model
    about safety [50]. Those models provide insights about the explicit treatment
    of trade-offs that can improve the implementation of trade-offs. Operational models
    combining trade-offs among Risk-Res-Sus include two numerical models about bridge
    infrastructure [64,65]. Since Risk-Res-Sus are treated within those operational
    models, and Vul is often considered part of Risk, these approaches may be the
    next steps for implementing VRRSability. One operational model treats the collection
    of Vul-Risk-Res-Sus in the form of a time-series assessment of a water reservoir
    system [68], but trade-offs are not considered. The above observations suggest
    that a modeling platform that treats all combinations of V-R-R-S can be useful
    for comprehensive evaluation of VRRSability decision trade-offs. Furthermore,
    the entries in Table 5, and particularly entries in Table A1, suggest a detailed
    collection of data needs that can be useful for model operationalization once
    the research reaches that phase of effort. 5. Discussion This paper elucidates
    the relations among V-R-R-S and the 13 components with respective sub-components.
    The Venn diagram approach to synthesis fell short for full elucidation of V-R-R-S
    concept combinations compared to a table that could enumerate all 2, 3, and 4
    concept combinations. The latter enumeration provided a basis for considering
    how various types of information structures could depict relationships among the
    13 components. A box–relation information structure was selected for portraying
    a VRRSability conceptual framework because it provides a synoptic compromise between
    the narrative and operational approaches. Five sophisticated box–relation examples
    were chosen to represent component relationships across the components and sub-components
    as potential for organizing a VRRSability conceptual framework. We highlighted
    in bold a collection of the most effective characterizations of components for
    forming a comprehensive conceptual framework of VRRSability. Those selections
    were synthesized and organized to depict the ‘related to’ relationship at the
    core of the VRRSability conceptual framework. Many iterations were needed to develop
    the framework, but the iterations were guided by excellent partial frameworks.
    Whether this framework is truly comprehensive awaits further confirmation with
    operational models. We applied the VRRSability conceptual framework to a UWLS,
    focusing on the VRRSability of GSI, particularly land cover in relation to water
    flow. The example provides a proof-of-concept validation of the relationships.
    Within a ULWS, land influences on water and water influences on land are both
    possible. Land influence on water is often seen as (potentially contaminated)
    ‘run-off;’ while water influence on land is seen as irrigation or flooding after
    the land is saturated. We chose the former land to water relationship as GSI for
    an application of the conceptual framework. The ULWS application helped verify
    the character of conceptual relations, demonstrating that the VRRSability of ULWS
    is indeed a useful and important application that would be improved considerably
    when a computational approach is available. Using an ordinal level of measurement
    for the GSI functional relationship, decision evaluation trade-offs among vulnerability,
    risk, resilience, and sustainability include the following examples: (1) minimizing
    the sensitivity of receptors to harm from hazard(s) as part of vulnerability,
    (2) minimizing the probability of harm to receptors as part of risk, (3) maximizing
    the probability of capability for the improvement in wellbeing as part of resilience,
    and (4) maximizing the capability to maintain well-being over the long term. V-R-R-S
    concepts were arrayed in terms of dimensions to depict complementary and inverse
    relationships. This made it easier to characterize decision evaluation trade-offs
    within and among functional performance relationships in the context of V-R-R-S
    concepts. These relationships will be a key guide to specifying and implementing
    operational models of VRRSability. Operationalization of decision evaluation trade-offs
    requires specification of data measurement units (metrics) within operational
    models designed by research practitioner analysts. Identifying units of measurement
    for the thirteen components plus sub-components characterized can be accomplished
    more easily for operational models based on the tables and frameworks presented
    herein. If these frameworks are not yet suitable, at least research groups now
    have a head start with sorting through the complexity to develop their own frameworks
    as researchers work toward comprehensive operational models. The enumeration of
    V-R-R-S partial combinations (Table 4 and Table A1) together with units of measurements
    (Table 1) can act as a guide for the comprehensive evaluation of VRRSability decision
    trade-offs. 6. Conclusions Three main contributions to knowledge emerge from the
    research effort reported in this paper. First, the results about VRRSability synthesis
    flesh out MOESIR Tier 2 ontology as a proof of concept and elucidation of its
    use within a geodesign assessment of green stormwater application fleshes out
    MOESIR Tier 4 epistemology as a proof of concept, which together provide motivation
    for the continued use of the MOESIR framework as a guide for improving geospatial
    decision support research and development. Second, the VRRSability conceptual
    framework composed of components and relations among them provides a solid foundation
    (in both breadth and depth) for the next step in operationalizing models characterizing
    decision evaluation trade-offs among (1) minimizing the sensitivity of receptors
    to harm from hazard(s) as part of vulnerability, (2) minimizing the probability
    of harm to receptors as part of risk, (3) maximizing the probability of capability
    for improvement in wellbeing as part of resilience, and (4) maximizing the capability
    to maintain well-being over the long term. Third, informed by the conceptual framework,
    operationalization of VRRSability models using a VRRSability intelligence ramp
    of data, information, evidence, knowledge and wisdom can take advantage of two
    artificial intelligence directions: GeoAI technology composed of three pillars
    (i.e., high-performance computing, machine learning, and geospatial big data),
    which interact to provide insights and large language model (LLM) technology based
    on massive knowledge graphs to provide insights about VRRSability decision evaluation
    trade-offs. In this synthesis of VRRSability, the number of V-R-R-S items being
    treated is beyond most peoples’ abilities when faced with making comparisons of
    evaluative constructs; therefore, computer-based decision support is required.
    The next steps for improving the designs of decision support software through
    systematic consideration of VRRSability decision trade-offs require operational
    modeling. As such, practical recommendations for the next steps in the research
    effort can draw information from Table 1, Table 2, Table 4 and Table A1 to offer
    direct insights into operational modeling across the combinations of V-R-R-S.
    As we examined each combination of V-R-R-S, many of those approaches identified
    with operational modeling will provide solid next steps for exploring the implementation
    of models. Some approaches offer useful insights about measurement, while others
    offer useful insights about multicriteria analysis. Some approaches offer insights
    about how to implement spatial and/or temporal models, while others offer insights
    about implementing trade-offs. We justified the selection of the thirteen components
    based on a preponderance of corroborating evidence culled from studies containing
    definitions and frameworks of one or more of V-R-R-S concepts. Although a preponderance
    of evidence approach will likely be used for enumerating operational constructs,
    a more structured approach such as SWOC (Strength, Weakness, Opportunity and Challenge)
    analysis [76] can provide additional insights for justifying and validating a
    selection of operational constructs. All of these insights can be useful for further
    integration and synthesis for implementing a family of operational models of VRRSability.
    Operationalizing comprehensive models of VRRSability might look to GeoAI research
    that combines machine learning on big spatial data and ontology frameworks for
    developing knowledge-based systems [8] and/or to LLMs that operationalize massive
    narrative text, with both approaches using knowledge graph technology [77,78].
    Measurements for variables of ULWS could be used in machine learning to obtain
    insights about trends, as a form of inductive inference. Concepts and relations
    in the conceptual framework could be used as an ontology for analyzing and synthesizing
    information, and when verified, that insight becomes evidence. Use of that ontology
    takes the form of deductive inference to guide machine learning. Merging (moving
    between) machine learning with big data (inductive reasoning) and analysis/synthesis
    with ontology (deductive reasoning) approaches as a cycle of processing constitutes
    the basis of GeoAI [8], and is the strategy employed in abductive reasoning, as
    a more effective approach for discovering hypotheses for knowledge building than
    either inductive or deductive reasoning alone [79]. GeoAI approaches have been
    used to merge data science, big spatial data, and geographic information systems
    and science to improve smart city approaches for spatial planning and decision
    support [80]. An approach to a GeoAI-VRRSability application could be as follows.
    VRRSability can be the ontology that serves as the schema that defines the semantic
    structure of V-R-R-S domain knowledge. With this, a knowledge graph can be created
    that is manually and auto populated with millions of triples: <subject, predicate,
    object>. This knowledge graph can be conversed via natural language queries by
    humans, as well as be the starting point for the GeoAI agent to find patterns,
    learn, adapt, and suggest robust and/or novel geospatial decision support. Critical
    to the success of this vision is ensuring this starting “top down” ontology is
    correct. The contributions in this paper move us closer as a community to that
    type of development. As a supplement to GeoAI, AI for LLM software technology
    has been developing for decades, but recent wide-spread availability of highly
    parallel computing has made LLMs more viable for synthesizing large amounts of
    text [77,78]. Such syntheses can enhance solutions that address the myriad of
    relationships within complex GSI decision problems that are often common in addressing
    improvement across ULWS, for example by reducing hallucinations and improving
    reasoning accuracy through augmentation by knowledge graph representations [81].
    Furthermore, LLMs have been shown to enhance the transparency of large amounts
    of narratives within sustainability reports [82]. Adding VRRSability ontology
    and epistemology to that mix of GeoAI and LLM technology will likely advance the
    transparency of decision evaluation trade-offs within geodesign decision problem
    assessment for ULWS within participatory decision settings. For example, Participatory
    AI can be used to help professional facilitators improve the way stakeholder participatory
    and decision-making processes are structured and performed [83]. The amount of
    LLM AI agents that can support VRRSability is exponentially increasing [84]. There
    is also the frontier of artificial general intelligence [85] that broadens the
    many specific AI areas of expertise, like GeoAI and Participatory AI, in integrated
    AI with the goal of supporting VRRSability. An enabling factor for this is the
    recognition that the VRRSability intelligence ramp as a novel contribution to
    the data–information–evidence–knowledge–wisdom spectrum can be enabled by including
    purpose as a pivotal parameter, thus contextualizing how data are processed into
    wisdom [85]. If we as a community can ensure that MOESIR and VRRSability are right,
    then many other promising developments can flow. Moving toward operational modeling
    of VRRSability can benefit from using a convergent research approach, which combines
    analysis and synthesis approaches while taking advantage of CyberGIS computing
    [9]. CyberGIS computing employs big data and high-performance resources as two
    of the three pillars of GeoAI [8], and as mentioned earlier, the original context
    motivates the development of MOESIR. CyberGIS computing can improve geodesign
    decision support applications of GSI with big data resources [9] and improve decision
    support processing of ULWS with high-performance computing. Developing insights
    across an intelligence ramp of data–information–evidence–knowledge–wisdom using
    CyberGIS-enabled GeoAI resources may provide the exciting next steps for operationalizing
    and implementing the MOESIR framework, and thereby considerably enhance ULWS-focused
    geodesign decision support. Finally, recommendations about the next steps for
    follow-on research by researchers across the world include broadening the VRRSability
    synthesis to address other geodesign application areas requiring the specification
    of variables and measurements (at MOESIR Tier 4). Many research application areas
    are in need of improved assessment of conditions, e.g., ocean ecosystem resources
    under considerable pressure from warming ocean regions, wildfire hazard pressures
    on forest ecosystem resources, water resource pressures such as extended droughts
    causing regional famines, aquifer depletion with associated collapses of farm
    productivity, homelessness community issues within urban–regional settings, and
    almost any application area addressing sustainable system health and well-being.
    Addressing any one (or more) of these topic areas will likely broaden and deepen
    our knowledge about applications at MOESIR Tier 4, and provide insights into the
    VRRSability synthesis at MOESIR Tier 2, while at the same time improving geodesign
    decision evaluation (assessment) by offering insights into MOESIR Tier 3, thereby
    enhancing decision support research and practice for communities around the world.

  description: There is a growing demand to develop sensors for health monitoring
    applications such as wearable systems for early detection of chronic diseases
    signs, water and food quality monitoring, and industrial production equipment
    monitoring. Among the many non-invasive health-monitoring sensors, ammonia, pH,
    and temperature sensors are particularly important as they have a critical effect
    on health of living organisms by changing chemical and biological reactions. This
    article provides a comprehensive examination of the attributes found in electrolytic
    solutions and the impact of electrolyte interface surface in pH sensors, along
    with the sensing mechanism in each sensor. The paper also includes a discussion

  explanation: '**Issue:** Once they are dissolved in water, metal salts acquire the
    ability to dissociate ions, which can cause an electrical current to flow through
    a solution. The current density from this movement of ions is proportional to
    the quantity of ions present in the solution. This property is utilized in electrochemical
    sensors, which are used to quantify the presence of specific ions, including hydrogen
    atoms (which have a +1 charge, making them "+1" ions), in a solution. There are
    instruments like pH sensors and ammonia gas sensors that are extremely sensitive
    and can be employed for monitoring health and food quality.


    **Problem:** The production of electrochemical sensors often includes harmful
    chemicals and synthetic materials, which upon improper disposal, can pose health
    hazards resulting from heavy metal (such as RuCl3) contamination in the environment.
    Unmanaged disposal of electrodes after sensor use can also lead to heavy metal
    contamination in landfills, which may cause hazardous health effects if it reaches
    the water supply. This issue mandates sustainable disposal processes to ensure
    that discarded sensors and their components do not harm the environment or its
    inhabitants.


    **Solution:** This problem can be addressed through the adoption of sustainable
    and eco-friendly practices throughout the life cycle of electrochemical sensors,
    including their design, fabrication, and disposal. Here are some specific measures
    that can be implemented:


    **In the design phase:**

    * **Selection of environmentally friendly materials:** Choosing materials with
    less hazardous properties for the fabrication of sensors can significantly reduce
    the environmental impact. For instance, replacing heavy metals with non-toxic
    conductive materials can minimize the risks associated with heavy metal contamination.

    * **Design for longevity:** Designing sensors with a longer lifespan can reduce
    the overall number of sensors produced and discarded, thereby minimizing the environmental
    impact. Employing robust materials and fabrication techniques that enhance sensor
    durability can contribute to sustainability.

    * **Modular design:** Adopting a modular design approach allows for the replacement
    of individual components instead of discarding the entire sensor. This approach
    reduces waste and facilitates the repair and refurbishment of sensors, extending
    their useful life.


    **In the fabrication phase:**

    * **Sustainable manufacturing processes:** Utilizing eco-friendly manufacturing
    techniques, such as those that minimize energy consumption and reduce waste generation,
    can contribute to sustainable sensor production. Employing processes like screen-printing
    or inkjet printing, which require less energy and produce less waste compared
    to traditional methods like photolithography, can be beneficial.

    * **Use of recycled materials:** Incorporating recycled materials into the fabrication
    process can reduce the environmental impact associated with raw material extraction
    and processing. Using recycled plastics or metals in sensor components can promote
    circularity and minimize waste.

    * **Minimizing the use of hazardous chemicals:** Employing non-toxic and biodegradable
    materials in the fabrication process can reduce the potential for environmental
    contamination. Substituting hazardous chemicals with safer alternatives can minimize
    the risks associated with their disposal.


    **In the disposal phase:**

    * **Proper waste management:** Establishing proper waste management practices
    is crucial to ensure that discarded sensors and their components are handled responsibly.
    Implementing recycling programs for sensor components, such as electrodes and
    electronic parts, can recover valuable materials and reduce the amount of waste
    going to landfills.

    * **Collaboration with waste management companies:** Partnering with specialized
    waste management companies that have expertise in handling electronic waste can
    ensure the safe and environmentally sound disposal of electrochemical sensors.
    These companies employ appropriate technologies and processes to extract reusable
    materials and treat hazardous substances, minimizing the environmental impact
    of sensor disposal.


    To further enhance the sustainability of electrochemical sensors, researchers
    and manufacturers should actively explore innovative approaches, such as the development
    of biodegradable sensors or the integration of sensors into recyclable or compostable
    materials. By embracing these sustainable practices throughout the entire life
    cycle of electrochemical sensors, we can minimize their environmental impact and
    contribute to a more sustainable future.'

    1. Introduction Ion sensitive metal oxides (MOx) with different geometries ranging
    from micro-to nano-structured morphologies and with the potential to tune their
    physical and chemical properties to meet each specific application, have gained
    considerable interest in electrochemical-biomedical disciplines. Diverse characteristics,
    including distinct electrical, electrochemical, and biocompatible attributes,
    enable their application in health monitoring sensors, such as wearable devices
    for detecting chronic diseases, monitoring water and food quality, and overseeing
    industrial production equipment. MOx exhibiting a considerable surface-to-volume
    ratio would suggest an enhancement in response time, selectivity, and catalytic
    activity [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5]]. Further, they are highly sensitive to the
    small change in the environment to be sensed and stable in the long term under
    different environmental conditions, making them a very favorable option for the
    next generation of online monitoring systems and wireless sensing applications
    [6]. Electrochemical breath sensors are noteworthy among the numerous non-invasive
    sensors that have a significant impact in maintaining the healthy equilibrium
    of physiological activity, the well-being of living organisms, and the treatment
    of illnesses [7,8]. Breath analysis is an important technique that does not require
    invasive measures for detecting and monitoring some specific diseases. It is valuable
    because it can offer insights into various biochemical mechanisms taking place
    within the human body. Among the numerous compounds that can be found in a breath
    sample, ammonia stands out due to its association with various conditions affecting
    the lungs, liver, kidneys, and stomach [8]. In the food industry, food items that
    contain a high amount of protein are prone to spoilage. This is because the breakdown
    of amino acids by microbial enzymes can lead to the formation of volatile amines
    such as NH3, through reactions such as decarboxylation and deamination [9]. The
    monitoring and regulation of pH, which is denoted by the hydrogen ion concentration,
    play a crucial role in numerous biological and chemical reactions across diverse
    domains like food processing, environmental science, and wearable technologies
    [[2], [3], [4]]. In addition, the simultaneous measurement of pH and ammonia level
    would help us to have a better understanding of any change in human body, food
    and water quality. Also, the pH values are influenced by temperature, which affects
    the extent of chemical reactions and the quantity of hydrogen ions (H+) or hydroxide
    ions (OH−) present. Beyond the interest in the relation between chemical reactions
    and temperature, researchers’ interests have evolved to monitor sophisticated
    health conditions such as pulmonological diagnostics and cardiovascular diseases
    [10,11]. Taken together, pH, temperature, and ammonia gas sensors can collect
    the effects of each factor on our health. In order to make these sensors an attractive
    option for wireless health monitoring systems, they should be inexpensive, easy-to-use,
    accurate, and flexible (in case of wearable applications). Further, creating high-functionality
    systems by integrating these sensors with other IT components would help them
    to operate autonomously. Therefore, microfabrication methods with the advantages
    of precise control over the surface morphologies/properties of material and reduction
    of materials used, would enable the utilization of these sensors in electrochemical-biomedical
    disciplines [[12], [13], [14]]. Hydrogel-based sensors, as one type of sensors,
    which is founded on the use of micro chemical-mechanical transducer, have been
    reported for pH measurement; however, their implementation poses challenges owing
    to their fragility and slow response time [[15], [16], [17]]. In contrast, micro-optical
    sensors offer exceptional precision and sensitivity, but they are expensive with
    limited sensing range and poor linearity [[18], [19], [20]]. Therefore, electrical
    and electrochemical sensors without the limitations of these two types of sensors
    are an attractive option for health monitoring systems. The advantages of these
    sensing systems are their affordability, ability for fast detection over a larger
    sensing range, ease of integration with microelectronic components for automated
    operations, small size and compatibility for wearable sensor systems [14]. Over
    the past ten years, several reviews were written regarding sensors that measure
    pH, temperature, and ammonia using electrical or electrochemical methods. One
    review article was published that explored metal-oxide-based pH sensors and their
    appropriateness in flexible and wearable biosensors intended for medical applications,
    and this was among the studies conducted [6]. Alam''s review in 2018 focused on
    the application of organic materials and polymers in healthcare for developing
    pH sensors [21]. In 2018, Mustafa and Andreescu published a review that centered
    on the use of smart packaging sensors for food monitoring [22]. In 2015, Qin et
    al. conducted a comprehensive review on electrochemical sensors, addressing the
    sensing mechanisms of pH and free chlorine sensors [14]. In 2020, a comprehensive
    study was published, focusing on the latest progress made in temperature sensors
    that employ nanomaterials and conductive polymers with flexible properties [23].
    Barmpakos and Kaltsas''s review in 2020 [24] focused on the design of printed
    temperature sensors. They also reviewed humidity and strain sensors. Another review
    paper in 2017 reported on the recent advances in flexible temperature sensors
    for wearable physiological monitoring [10]. For NH3 gas sensors, Lefferts et al.
    [8] focused on ammonia sensors as non-invasive tools for diagnosis the diseases
    related to human health. Their particular focus in terms of the main analytical
    methods for ammonia analysis in this paper was chemical sensing methods. Focusing
    on breath analysis, another paper published in 2019 [7], in which breath marker
    selection, breath sampling, and material design to achieve the requirements for
    a sensor with good performance characteristics were described. In 2019, Aarya,
    published a review paper focused on ammonia gas sensors, examining a range of
    responsive materials, including metals, metal oxides, metal oxide-polymers, and
    hybrid nanostructures based on carbon nanotubes. The paper delved into their distinct
    capabilities for detecting varying levels of ammonia across diverse applications
    [25]. In the field of food industry, Andre et al. introduced a notable advancement
    in amine gas sensors, specifically ammonia sensors, utilized for monitoring food
    quality [26]. However these reviews have not discussed the detailed sensing mechanism
    of metal oxides specific to each type of sensor, including the recent developments
    and fabrication methods that affect their performance. Moreover, there is a gap
    of knowledge on how these three different sensors (ammonia, pH, and temperature)
    are related to each other. Therefore, in this review we aim to include all the
    aforementioned information in detail. The primary aim of this review is to provide
    an in-depth discussion into how each type of sensor works and the latest advancements
    in the field. The overall perspective presented in this paper emphasizes the possibility
    of incorporating these sensors into cost-effective, adaptable, and precise wireless
    health monitoring systems, particularly for wearable uses. Fig. 1 shows the visual
    structure of the review paper for three major classes of health monitoring sensors.

    1. Graphical overview of this review paper. 2. Health monitoring systems Health
    monitoring systems have become increasingly important in various fields, including
    pharmaceuticals, environmental science, food processing, and biomedical applications.
    These systems play a central role in maintaining the well-being of living organisms
    and have applications in diverse domains. In this section, we will explore the
    critical role of pH, temperature, and ammonia sensors in health monitoring and
    their impact on different aspects of our lives. 2.1. pH sensor The pH value plays
    a central role in numerous health and monitoring domains, including pharmaceuticals,
    environmental science, food processing, and biomedical applications. In biological
    environments, maintaining a healthy equilibrium is achieved by sensing this essential
    parameter (pH), represented in terms of the hydrogen ion concentration [[27],
    [28], [29]]. The pH level significantly affects an individual''s medical and biological
    condition. For instance, healthy skin maintains a slightly acidic pH (around 5.5),
    while wounded skin shifts towards a more basic pH range (approximately 7.0–8.5)
    due to the presence of enzymes and bacteria [1]. Therefore, continuous pH monitoring
    of skin would help in detecting infectious skin diseases such as acne vulgaris,
    atopic dermatitis, or irritant contact dermatitis [4,5,30]. In fact, sustaining
    life in biological systems is a result of balancing interactions between chemicals,
    which is achieved through equilibrium states. These equilibrium states would regulate
    the proper activity of different fluids, reactions rates, and eventually the proper
    pH value. Therefore, any change in the pH value alters the balance and the equilibrium
    [31]. As another example, a tumor cell is a complex entity existing within the
    body. When tumors lead to a decrease in blood vessels and oxygen supply, they
    cause an elevation in anaerobic energy production, resulting in by-products that
    have the capacity to donate H+ ions. Consequently, this leads to a notably more
    acidic environment compared to the surrounding healthy tissues. This distinct
    pH difference can serve as a means to distinguish tumor tissues from normal ones
    and enable the monitoring of its progression and growth [32]. Apart from biomedical
    applications, the pH value is an important index in food processing since it describes
    protein denaturation, microorganism growth, and the activation or deactivation
    of bacterial spores [[33], [34], [35]]. pH is a useful tool in food packaging
    as it helps to identify the presence of microbes or volatile nitrogen compounds
    that are generated during the spoilage of fish or meat, making it an effective
    indicator of food freshness. Similarly, in the wastewater industry, the pH value
    of polluted water can be measured and monitored to indicate the level of pollution.
    For drinking water, maintaining a consistent pH level between 6.5 and 8.5 is required
    in order to guarantee good quality [36,37]. In Table 1, the importance of pH monitoring
    for environmental, health, and food samples is summarized. Table 1. The importance
    of pH monitoring for different samples. Category Sample type Function Balanced

    of amino acids [56] Due to the critical significance control of pH levels, different
    methods of pH detection within biological systems and health-related monitoring
    systems can be used depending on the restrictions and situational needs. The two
    main methods used for measuring pH, are the colorimetric and electrochemical approaches.
    However, there are two main problems with colorimetric methods: one is stability
    and the other is accuracy [6]. Hence, there is a significant demand for electrochemical
    pH sensors across various fields due to their fast response time (less than 10
    s), capacity to operate within a wide pH range (2-12), easy integration onto flexible
    substrates, and remarkable sensitivity (approximating the Nernstian value of 59.12
    mV/pH). Moreover, they offer the advantages of biocompatibility and cost-effective
    fabrication [6,38]. In order to design a highly sensitive and selective electrochemical
    pH sensor, there is a need to understand the mechanism of charge transport in
    electrolytes, as most chemical and biological experiments are carried out in electrolytes
    (ionic solutions) [39]. The conductive properties of electrolytes differ from
    those of semiconductors and metals due to the involvement of ions in conduction.
    These ions not only carry the charge but also exhibit chemical reactivity, enabling
    them to interact with surfaces. Consequently, it becomes essential to account
    for chemical-related occurrences when exploring ionic conduction. Ions exhibit
    different behavior in the bulk electrolyte than at the interface of metal/oxide-electrolyte.
    Charge transfer in the bulk electrolyte is comparable to that in resistors, and
    identifying the factors that determine the resistivity/conductivity of the bulk
    electrolytes can help in understanding its bulk transport [40]. The molar conductivity
    is a common measure of electrolyte conductivity, and it is used to characterize
    strong (fully dissolved) and dilute electrolytes. The formula for molar conductivity
    is provided below [41]: (1) Ʌ Ʌ Ʌ where Ʌ is the molar conductivity when a solution
    is infinitely diluted and the interactions between the counter ions are ignored.
    Ʌ ( Ʌ ) is the molar ionic conductivity for positive (negative) ions, and ( )
    is the valence of positive (negative) ion. The correlation between the molar ionic
    conductivity, ionic mobility (μ) and concentration (n) can be expressed as [41]:
    (2) Ʌ Ʌ Since ions in bulk electrolyte and electrons in metal resistors, are influenced
    by similar forces; then it is possible to simulate the movement of ions in the
    electrolyte using a resistor [41,42]. However, the mechanism by which charges
    are transported at the metal-electrolyte interface is quite different because
    ions are not able to migrate into metals. Instead, the electrons would be exchanged
    between the ions and the electrode (metal) to conduct current. Redox reactions
    occurring at the electrode''s surface facilitate the transfer of electrons between
    the electrolyte and metal interface. The probability of electron exchange depends
    on various factors such as the electrolyte composition, chemical potential differences
    on both sides, and the properties of the electrode''s surface [43]. Accordingly,
    as shown in Fig. 2 three hypotheses are suggested for metal electrodes: • Ideally
    polarizable electrodes: In such electrodes, which can be also modeled as a capacitor,
    there is no charge transfer between electrolyte and electrode because metals are
    resistive to redox reactions, hence electron transfer. • Non-polarizable electrodes:
    Unlike the previous case, these electrodes provide no hindrance for the migration
    and accumulation of charge carriers. Therefore, an extremely small resistor can
    model such an electrode. • Partially polarizable electrodes: They exhibit varying
    levels of resistance to the movement of charge carriers. Sometimes, they would
    exhibit the same characteristics as ideally polarizable electrodes over a certain
    range of applied potential, and outside that potential range, they would deviate
    considerably [42]. Download : Download high-res image (237KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 2. Basic simplified models for three distinct electrode types
    [44]. Typically, whenever an electrode encounters an electrolyte, there will be
    a difference in chemical potential at the interface region, which will result
    in the presence of a certain number of charges on the electrode and the electrolyte
    interface. These charges arise from redox reactions [40]. When charges are separated,
    an electric field is created at the interface, which prevents the redox reactions
    to progress further. Consequently, if an external bias is introduced between the
    electrode and electrolyte, some of it will compensate for the inherent electric
    potential, while the remainder would enable current flow [41,42]. By applying
    an external bias, accumulation of charge carriers in the electrolyte''s surface
    area and the electrode takes place. Due to abundance of charge carriers, all the
    charges reside on the surface of the electrode. Nevertheless, the charges present
    in the electrolyte area are ionic in nature, characterized by their relatively
    large radii. As a result, these ionic charges are unable to shield the associated
    electric field generated by the excess charges on the electrode surface. Consequently,
    a diffuse region of surplus ions forms near the interface. The finite width of
    these charges results in an electrostatic potential drop. This region with a diffuse
    layer of charges is commonly referred to as the electrical double layer or the
    Gouy-Chapman double layer, illustrated in Fig. 3(a) [43,45]. However, the experimental
    calculations in terms of the double layer charges and capacitance are different
    from the predicated values. Stern addressed this discrepancy by discovering that
    the minimum distance between the ions and the electrode''s surface must be equal
    to or greater than the ionic radius. This distance which is known as the outer
    Helmholtz plane (OHP), could be affected by the solvation shell of water molecules
    [43]. This phenomenon is shown in Fig. 3(b). Download : Download high-res image

    theory of electrical double layer, showing the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP), outer
    Helmholtz plane (OHP), and the diffuse layer and its potential variation. Releasing
    an ion from its surrounding water molecules requires a significant amount of energy.
    Consequently, a region close to the electrode''s surface will lack charged ions,
    leading to a consistent capacitance referred to as the Stern capacitance. The
    Stern capacitance is approximately valued at 20 μF/cm2. Stern''s double layer
    theory provides a precise framework for describing how the potential applied to
    an electrochemical surface relates to the charge buildup on its surface. However,
    this theory neglects to account for the potential influence of chemical reactions,
    which could lead to supplementary charge generation and alter the surface potential.
    Therefore, Yates et al. [57] introduced the site-binding theory to explain this
    change in surface potential. As an example, if you consider SiO2, its surface
    with a large amount of unsatisfied bonds is able to make bonds with unshielded
    hydrogen and hydroxyl ions, in the absence of specific adsorption. At thermal
    equilibrium, this surface layer is dynamically balanced: (3) (4) According to
    the reactions occurring at the interface, the pH-sensitive layer''s initially
    neutral surface (insulator) has the potential to transform into a positive or
    negative site. This transformation is a result of either accepting protons from
    the electrolyte or donating electrons to the electrolyte solution. The overall
    charge on the surface is determined by the imbalance between the number of positive
    and negative sites, which is influenced by the pH of the solution. Therefore,
    H+ and OH− are the determining ions for the potential of the interface and the
    charged surface groups at the interface of SiO2-solution create an electric double
    layer (EDL) structure. The EDL consists of the Helmholtz layer (Stern layer) and
    the diffuse layer. The Stern layer comprises two distinct planes, referred to
    as the inner Helmholtz plane (IHP) and the outer Helmholtz plane (OHP). The IHP
    corresponds to the location where adsorbed ions form pairs with the charged surface
    sites, while the OHP is the region where hydrated ions come closest to the surface.
    The diffuse layer extends from the OHP to the bulk of solution (Fig. 3(c)). The
    surface potential of the insulator depends on the reactions occurring in the electrolyte,
    particularly at the interface between the solution and the insulator. The pH level
    influences this relationship, and the resulting expression for the surface potential
    can be described as follows [45]: (5) where, k is the Boltzmann''s constant, T
    is the absolute temperature, pHpzc is the value of the pH for which the oxide
    surface is electrically neutral and β reflects the sensor sensitivity and depends
    on the density of hydroxyl groups over the surface. The capability of an oxide
    layer for chemical sensing is represented by β. Assuming that β is sufficiently
    large, it is possible to consider  = 1. At 25 °C, altering the pH level by one
    unit results in a surface potential shift of 59.16 mV, commonly known as the Nernst
    response. In the context of pH sensors, β denotes the binding sites responsible
    for H3O+ (e.g., –OH groups) on the surface and is defined as: (6) The greater
    the number of surface binding sites per unit area (NS), along with the dissociation
    constants for acidic (Ka) and basic (Kb) equilibrium, and the double-layer capacitance
    (CDL), the more sensitive the pH response becomes. Additionally, a larger NS leads
    to a linear response. Consequently, for an effective pH sensing material, it is
    crucial to possess abundant surface binding sites to facilitate the adsorption
    of H3O+. Among the different electrochemical sensors available, most of the pH
    sensors cited in literature depend on the potentiometric method. These pH sensors
    comprise two essential electrodes: the working electrode (WE) and the reference
    electrode (RE). By measuring the potential difference between these electrodes,
    the sensor''s sensitivity to changes in pH is determined. This potential difference,
    according to Eq. (7), is dependent on the properties of material''s surface such
    as porosity, microstructure, crystallinity, and homogeneity. The Nernst equation
    is employed to express the material''s pH sensitivity as the Nernstian response
    [6]: (7) where E represents the potential difference (in mV) between the working
    and reference electrodes, while Eo stands for the standard redox potential (in
    mV). R denotes the universal gas constant (8.314 JK−1mol−1), T represents the
    temperature (in K), n indicates the number of electrons, and F represents the
    Faraday constant (96485 Cmol-1). Assuming the transfer of a single electron at
    room temperature, the electrode''s ideal pH sensitivity, which is considered the
    benchmark for excellent pH sensors, is −59.16 mV/pH. When the solution has more
    H+ ions at low pH, the open circuit potential increases due to the accumulation
    of charges [6]. While, in an alkaline solution when there is a buildup of OH−
    groups on metal oxide surfaces, the electrode potential will decrease. Besides
    sensitivity, the pH sensor''s overall performance depends on various factors such
    as response time, hysteresis, drift, selectivity, and stability. “Response time”
    refers to the time it takes for the open circuit potential to achieve 90 % of
    its equilibrium when placed in a solution with a specific pH level [58]. This
    period is affected by the characteristics of the material, including its morphology,
    composition, porosity, and thickness, as well as the range of pH values being
    measured. In terms of material properties, Zhuiykov et al. [59] concluded that
    an increase in the thickness of planar film made of Cu2O doped RuO2, would result
    in a faster response due to the increase in open porosity, which helps the ions
    from the outer active surface to diffuse or adsorb onto the inner active sites.
    A faster reaction time may also stem from electrochemical reactions occurring
    on the surface of the WE, particularly on the active surfaces located in the interior
    and in connection with the grain faceting of the WE, as well as the grain size
    (shown in Fig. 4(a)). Manjakkal et al. conducted a study on the impact of pH measurement
    range on metal oxide sensors. They found that these sensors exhibit a more rapid
    response in acidic solutions with a greater concentration of hydrogen ions. This
    phenomenon can be attributed to the greater mobility and smaller size of H+ ions
    relative to OH− ions [6]. The next factor involves the impact of other ions on
    the pH sensor''s sensing capabilities, known as the interference effect. It is
    used to characterize the ability of the sensor to distinguish a specific ion from
    other common ions that may be present in the solution, which is one of the main
    drawbacks of MOx sensors made of commercial pastes [60]. This may be due to the
    presence of lead in the WE and could be improved by changing the type of material
    of the WE. Download : Download high-res image (308KB) Download : Download full-size

    carriers to reach the Pt current conductor [59]. (b) The definitions for hysteresis
    and drift as factors for accuracy and stability, respectively [61]. The performance
    characteristics of pH sensors is not limited to sensitivity, response time, and
    selectivity. In order to investigate their accuracy, useful lifetimes, and their
    performance in decreasing or increasing the pH in a loop, two more parameters,
    namely potential drift and hysteresis must be considered. Fig. 4(b) illustrates
    the impact of hysteresis and drift on pH sensors during pH measurements. The term
    “potential drift” pertains to the changes in the output voltage of the WE over
    time, occurring within a pH solution with consistent composition and temperature.
    Some factors that contribute to the drift effect include: presence of OH− ions
    in basic solutions [45], trapped H2 at grain boundaries or pores due to the transport
    of H+ ions through the WE [62], or Cl− ions [5]. When the pH levels are constant,
    there is a variation in the recorded electrochemical potentials, which is known
    as the hysteresis effect. The hysteresis width has a strong dependence on the
    measurement range of pH value and the pH cycling time, so its effect is often
    greater in basic solutions and for longer cycling times. Furthermore, variations
    in the surface morphology and hydration levels of an electrode can affect the
    width of the hysteresis. This phenomenon arises as a result of the establishment
    of new equilibrium conditions between the electrode and the neighboring solution
    [63]. In summary in Fig. 5, a schematic explaining the various metal oxide-based
    pH sensors along with their applications, key measurement techniques, parameters
    for analysis and applications are shown. • Potentiometric pH sensor Potentiometry
    is one of the most widely used technique for pH measurement, due to its small
    size, and precise and reliable operation. It consists of a WE and a RE, where
    the RE is mainly Ag/AgCl due to its stable potential [1,64] as shown in Fig. 6(a).
    Although different types of metal oxides have been used for the fabrication of
    the working electrode, the potentiometric method suffers from the lack of a suitable
    RE, especially in the context of wireless and miniaturized device for an integrated
    sensor. In these sensors, due to the absence of KCl as the electrolyte for the
    exchange of Cl− ion, the AgCl layer becomes unstable over time resulting in the
    change of its potential [65,66]. To address this problem, a layer of KCl−containing
    glass, free from lead, was applied over the AgCl to stabilize the concentration
    of Cl−. When compared to glass-based reference electrodes, this particular electrode
    exhibits a potential of 10 mV and remains functional for a duration of 2 years
    [64,67]. Download : Download high-res image (326KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 6. (a) Illustration of potentiometric (b) Chemiresistive/Conductimetric
    and (c) ISFET pH sensor [6]. The method for measuring sensitivity involves determining
    the electrical potential difference between the RE and the WE while they are submerged
    in a solution of a specific pH level. Then the slope of graph of output potential
    as a function of pH gives the sensitivity of the sensor. Potentiometric pH sensors
    have emerged as a promising technique for online monitoring applications due to
    their excellent performance and the fact that they do not require a power source.
    As an example, this has led to the use of inkjet printed PdO-based pH sensors
    for online water quality monitoring [68]. For health monitoring applications where
    we care about the quality of water and food, miniaturized low-cost pH sensors
    using MOx-based materials developed using printing methods are promising. It may
    be due to the numerous advantages that these methods offer such as mass production,
    high homogeneity, and the incorporation of wireless transmission capabilities
    through a single module that integrates WE, RE, and electronic circuits [[68],
    [69], [70]]. • Chemiresistive/Conductimetric pH sensor Chemiresistive and conductimetric
    pH sensors operate by similar principles. In these sensors, the working electrode
    is placed between two conducting electrodes, which removes the requirement for
    a RE [71,72] as shown in Fig. 6(b). Chemiresistors contain pH-sensitive materials
    that possess inherent electrical properties, and these materials are responsive
    to the change in the concentration of H3O+/OH− ions [73]. The properties of a
    material with n-type or p-type conductivity can be influenced by its intrinsic
    charge carriers or external impurities. When H3O+/OH− ions interact with these
    substances, specific regions may emerge because of both physical and chemical
    reactions. Such occurrences can lead to alterations in the material''s resistance
    or conductance through the generation of new localized materials possessing distinct
    electrical characteristic [74], or the creation of charge accumulation or depletion
    layers within the material [14]. Fig. 6(b) illustrates this process. When there
    are higher concentrations of H3O+ ions, the surface of an n-type material will
    have a higher concentration of electrons, while a higher concentration of OH-
    ions will lead to a lower concentration of electrons on the surface [75]. Although
    these sensors do not require a RE, an external power supply is needed for operating
    chemiresistive sensors. To tackle this problem, Manjakkal et al., developed a
    self-powered pH sensor using CuO. The device incorporates a flexible solar cell
    for energy generation and a supercapacitor for energy storage [3]. • Ion-sensitive
    field-effect transistor (ISFET) pH sensor The ISFET represents a field-effect
    transistor (FET) that detects and reacts to molecules and ions present in solutions
    or gases and operates in a similar way to the MOSFET. Bergveld [76] employed the
    first ISFET in 1970 for ion activities measurement within electrochemical and
    biological environments. Its configuration is a MOSFET except that the gate is
    separated from the chip and is replaced by a reference electrode and the electrolyte
    (Fig. 6(c)), and the dielectric (oxide) layer is normally a pH sensitive layer
    [76,77]. Compared to a glass pH electrode, ISFETs offer miniaturized size, fast
    response, and low cost. However, due to their direct formation on FET electrode,
    they have certain drawbacks that include device instability (hysteresis and drift),
    sensitivity to light, and low current sensitivity [14]. Download : Download high-res

    pH sensors along with their applications, key measurement techniques, parameters
    for analysis and applications. To overcome drawbacks, Spiegel et al. [128] introduced
    Extended Gate Field-Effect Transistors (EGFETs). In EGFETs, the FET is isolated
    from the chemical solution, and the sensitive film is deposited at the end of
    a signal line extended from the FET electrode [78,79]. EGFETs find widespread
    applications in biosensor development [[78], [79], [80]]. They offer significant
    advantages, including long-term stability, insensitivity to light and temperature
    drift, and disposability. The pH sensing mechanism of EGFETs aligns with site
    binding theory. Interestingly, only a limited number of semiconductor metal oxides
    (e.g., SnO2 on FTO substrate [81], ITO [82]) have been employed for EGFET-based
    pH sensor fabrication. These advancements contribute to the broader understanding
    of ion-selective pH sensing technologies, offering enhanced stability and applicability
    in biosensing applications. 2.2. Temperature sensor Temperature regulation extends
    beyond the human body and holds significant importance in various domains like
    food and water management. While the quality of food and water is not solely dependent
    on their temperature, it significantly influences numerous biological, physical,
    and chemical processes that ultimately affect their overall quality. Therefore,
    temperature serves as an important factor to prevent bacterial and microbial growth
    and is often used as an indicator of the overall quality of food and water [83].
    To ensure accurate monitoring of food and water quality, temperature measurements
    are essential, as temperature affects other parameters. For instance, the sensitivity
    of pH sensors and the consistency of their results depend on the temperature,
    as per the Nernst equation (equation (7)). This dependence is due to the impact
    of temperature on the viscosity and ion mobility in the solution. In general,
    the temperature can affect pH measurements in two main ways. Firstly, it may cause
    a decline in the precision and speed of the electrode, affecting the accuracy
    of measurements. Secondly, it can introduce result discrepancies due to the material''s
    temperature coefficient [84]. The “isothermal point,” which is the point where
    calibration lines intersect at different temperatures, ideally represents the
    zero potential point. However, since different materials have various temperature
    coefficients contributing to the overall potential, the isothermal point might
    deviate from the ideal, leading to drifting pH measurements over time. This issue
    can be addressed by maintaining a carefully controlled thermal environment or
    using temperature-insensitive electrode materials [85]. Thermal variation would
    also affect the chemical equilibriums at the electrode-electrolyte interface,
    given that the solubility extent of the metal salt due to the temperature change
    would lead to a time-varying response and drift. In glass pH electrodes, the electrode
    resistance rises as the temperature decreases, leading to a delayed response,
    and if temperatures drop significantly, the electrodes may cease to function entirely.
    Therefore, considering all temperature effects, accuracy of the pH measurement
    and the repeatability of the results are necessary to extend their applications
    to the healthcare fields. Rosenthaul et al. demonstrated the temperature dependence
    coefficient of blood and plasma pH with the values of −0.0147 and −0.0118 pH/
    , respectively [86]. Furthermore, pH sensors show temperature dependence in addition
    to altering the solution pH with temperature. Huang et al. highlighted this phenomenon
    by studying iridium oxide films'' pH sensing capabilities, enabling accurate monitoring
    of pH levels based on temperature variations [87]. They showed that based on the
    Nernst equation, the Nernstian potential, which is used to determine the pH, has
    an intrinsic dependency to the temperature. Their findings indicate that the temperature
    sensitivity of the pH sensor would shift from −0.3 to −2.0 mV/°C, respectively,
    when subjected to varying pH levels ranging from 2 to 10. In biomedical domains,
    pH sensors find further utilization, including their application within organisms
    like detecting potentially acidic tumor cells. In this context, it becomes essential
    to address the temperature sensitivity of these pH sensors to avoid any misinterpretation
    between healthy and diseased cells. Consequently, current research endeavors focus
    on developing integrated sensors capable of simultaneously measuring temperature
    and pH to enhance accuracy and reliability [88,89]. For instance, Nakata et al.
    [90] reported on the development of wearable sensors designed to continuously
    monitor pH and temperature by analyzing an individual''s sweat. The incorporation
    of a flexible temperature sensor in this system allows for the simultaneous compensation
    of pH sensing''s temperature dependence while also enabling skin temperature monitoring.

    full-size image Fig. 7. Schematic illustrating various types of temperature sensors
    and methods for applying sensing materials onto substrates, together with their
    corresponding applications. Electronic temperature sensors are primarily divided
    into two main types: resistance temperature detectors (RTD) and thermistors. RTDs
    function by capitalizing on the alteration in the electrical resistance of a metal
    concerning changes in temperature. When the temperature rises, the electrical
    resistance increases due to the generation of electron vibrations, which restrict
    the free flow of electrons in conductive materials [91]. The sensitive components
    employed in building RTDs consist of pure metal elements like Pt, Ni, and Cu.
    The temperature responsiveness, which governs the correlation between resistance
    and temperature, depends on the composition of materials utilized in constructing
    the RTD. This characteristic is referred to as the temperature coefficient of
    resistance (TCR, α), as demonstrated in the following depiction: (8) The resistance
    at temperature T is denoted as R(T), and the initial resistance of the sample
    at temperature T0 is represented as R(T0) [92]. RTDs can be constructed in two
    forms, either wire wound (Fig. 8(a)), where a metal wire is wrapped around a ceramic
    rod, or thin film (Fig. 8(b)), where a temperature sensing material is deposited
    as a thin layer on a substrate. To ensure accuracy in applications related to
    the human body and prevent errors due to self-heating of the resistive film or
    wire, a highly sensitive sensing material with precision is required. Hence, the
    Wheatstone bridge is widely employed. In Fig. 8(c), an illustration of a simple
    configuration for the measurement circuit is presented, featuring a voltage source
    and two parallel resistive voltage divider circuits, each containing two resistors
    [93]. The second most common temperature sensor is the thermistor with the advantages
    of response to small temperature changes and higher accuracy compared to RTDs.
    The thermistor operates on a sensing mechanism similar to RTD, relying on alterations
    in the electrical resistance of the sensing substances in response to temperature
    changes. Thermistors can be divided into two categories: those with a negative
    thermal coefficient of resistance (NTC), where their resistance decreases as temperature
    rises, and a second category with a positive thermal coefficient (PTC), causing
    their resistance to increase as temperature rises. Thermistors primarily utilize
    ceramic-type semiconductors (such as oxides of Ni, V, Co), organic semiconductors,
    and carbon-based materials (including CNT, Gr, GO, rGO) [24]. Download : Download

    2.3. Ammonia sensor Currently, we have many diagnostic tools and preventative
    and therapeutic measures to combat diseases. However, despite this, controlling
    some diseases like diabetes, renal dysfunction, or cancer remains a major challenge.
    The ongoing revolution in healthcare, transitioning from a disease-focused approach
    to a forward-looking, preventive, individualized, and collaborative medical model
    known as “4P” medicine, holds immense promise for the future [94]. Examining volatile
    organic compounds (VOCs) present in exhaled breath may offer prompt and crucial
    health information via low-cost, rapid, and non-invasive screening techniques
    for detecting and monitoring some prevalent illnesses [95]. Indeed, the abundant
    physiological information present in human breath [96], makes it highly appealing
    for (1) identifying early stages of diseases through abnormal breath patterns
    [97], and (2) tailoring disease treatment on a personal level [97]. The COVID-19
    pandemic has influenced individuals with chronic diseases in both direct and indirect
    ways. 28 % of COVID-19 hospital patients are found to have chronic kidney disease
    (CKD), a condition where kidney function is reduced or limited [98]. COVID-19,
    a highly transmissible disease triggered by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, presents symptoms
    like fever, cough, and difficulty breathing. Recent investigations have revealed
    notable differences in the biochemical profiles of COVID-19 patients, with severe
    cases showing increased blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels due to kidney damage
    [[99], [100], [101], [102], [103]]. Studies indicate that kidney dysfunction signs,
    including proteinuria (59 %) and hematuria (44 %), are also observed in COVID-19
    patients [101]. BUN is a measurement of the nitrogen in your blood caused by urea,
    a waste chemical that accumulates due to kidney damage. This accumulation of urea
    impairs liver function and slows down the processing of ammonia [104]. Elevated
    levels of blood urea nitrogen suggest higher amounts of ammonia in the body. Other
    studies have shown that blood urea nitrogen levels can be highly correlated (95
    %) with ammonia levels in breath [105]. Similar to COVID-19, elevated BUN and
    ammonia levels have been reported in patients with CKD [106,107]. However, increased
    ammonia levels have also been observed in patients infected with H. pylori [108,109],
    a bacterium that raises ammonia production in the stomach [110]. Hence, ammonia
    has the potential to serve as a biomarker for liver and kidney screening as well
    as detecting H. pylori infections. As mentioned earlier, deficiencies in liver
    and kidney performance, along with H. pylori infection, can lead to increased
    ammonia levels in various parts of the body, such as the mouth (248−2935 ppb)
    [111], nose (at ∼ 100 ppb) [112], and skin (<10 ppb) [113]. However, it is important
    to note that enzymes in saliva mainly produce the amount of ammonia exhaled from
    the mouth, and high levels may indicate poor oral hygiene [114,115]. Therefore,
    measuring ammonia levels through exhaled breath from the nose may provide a better
    correlation to blood ammonia levels, but it can be difficult because of its low
    concentrations. Additionally, ammonia levels can rise after eating protein-rich
    meals and during fasting [116]. Due to these factors, the clinical significance
    of ammonia levels measured from the mouth or nose exhaled breath must be carefully
    evaluated [115]. Ammonia sensing is not limited to biomedical applications; but
    it also would be an important indicator of food and water safety. Food items with
    a high protein content are highly perishable due to the breakdown of amino acids
    by both natural and microbial enzymes, resulting in the production of volatile
    amines [9]. This process of spoilage leads to an increase in volatile amines over
    time [117]. Ammonia, dimethylamine (DMA), and trimethylamine (TMA) are the most
    commonly encountered volatile amines. These compounds are responsible for producing
    unpleasant odors that can adversely affect the overall quality of food [118].
    Consequently, assessing the concentration of these amines in food serves as an
    effective means to gauge its quality, freshness, and safety. The specific type
    of amine produced and its concentration during spoilage will differ depending
    on the type of food. For example, relying solely on measuring ammonia levels is
    not a dependable method to ascertain the freshness and quality of fish [119].
    DMA is regarded as a more dependable measure of meat''s freshness, but this applies
    solely to species that possess the trimethylamine oxidase enzyme. In contrast,
    TMA can indicate spoilage but not the freshness of meat. While it may be consistently
    present in certain fresh foods, its levels can notably rise after 10 days of storage
    [119]. Therefore, the total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N), which is the sum
    of the primary, secondary, and tertiary volatile amines, is considered the most
    reliable indicator of food freshness. This method is more robust and eliminates
    the necessity for calibration based on food item, like the type of fish, red or
    white meat, or specific cuts of red meat [120]. In recent years, there has been
    a joint effort between scientific groups and government bodies to set limits on
    TVB-N for determining the freshness of protein-rich foods. The most recent guidelines
    indicate that a TVB-N of less than 0.15 mg g−1 in pork, beef, lamb or poultry,
    and a TVB-N of less than 0.2 mg g−1 in fish, is acceptable for consumption. Spoilage
    is considered to begin at TVB-N values above 0.28 mg g−1, which is classified
    as nonacceptable for human consumption [[121], [122], [123]]. It is noteworthy
    that some national organizations have stricter recommendations for TVB-N limits.
    Most research has focused on developing sensors for measuring food quality. These
    sensors generally determine food quality by detecting the presence of ammonia
    or a mixture of ammonia and other volatile amines [26]. In addition to food monitoring,
    it is crucial to regularly observe water quality, particularly by assessing ammonia
    levels, as it can result in toxic accumulation in tissues and blood [124]. Such
    monitoring is essential to minimize the risk of diseases and maintain a healthy
    environment for aquatic life. Aquatic ammonia is present in two forms, dissolved
    ammonia (NH3) and ammonium ion (NH4+), with the former being particularly harmful
    even at low concentrations [125]. Elevated NH3 levels can lead to eutrophication,
    depleting dissolved oxygen levels and reducing sunlight availability for aquatic
    species [125]. As per the World Health Organization, a concentration of NH3 exceeding
    0.01 mM in chlorinated drinking water can reduce disinfection efficiency, and
    higher concentrations indicate possible fecal pollution [126]. A significant amount
    of research has been carried out to devise techniques for detecting extremely
    low concentrations of ammonia in the gaseous phase. Nevertheless, each approach
    comes with its own limitations when it comes to detecting ammonia with optimal
    effectiveness and efficiency. For example, fluorescence chromatography aims to
    identify ammonia at 100 ppb [127], but encounters difficulties due to potential
    interference from background gases such as nitrogen, necessitating additional
    calibration. Alternative methods such as spectroscopy [[128], [129], [130]] and
    gas chromatography [131] are employed for ammonia detection as well. Nevertheless,
    their utilization as a screening tool is hindered due to the requirement of costly
    and cumbersome equipment, the necessity for well-trained and experienced personnel,
    and the time-consuming pre-concentration of samples [132]. Therefore, to monitor
    breath ammonia in large populations on a daily basis, and for food quality monitoring,
    there is a need for easy-to-use, portable ammonia gas detectors. Extensive research
    has been directed towards gas sensors utilizing electrical transduction owing
    to their affordability, simple design, and seamless integration with mainstream
    electronic technologies [[133], [134], [135]]. The fundamental principle underlying
    these sensors lies in the alteration of electrical attributes of conductive materials
    upon interaction with particular gases [136,137]. By converting electrical conductivity/resistivity,
    work function, and dielectric constant into measurable electrical signals such
    as current, voltage, resistance, capacitance, or impedance, these sensors can
    effectively quantify gas presence [133]. Chemiresistive sensors stand out among
    various electrical gas sensor variants, holding promise as clinical diagnostic
    instruments because of their compact size [138], affordability, and energy efficiency
    [139], making them suitable for use in handheld devices [140]. Such low-cost technology
    has remarkable potential for use at the point of care as breath markers, able
    to quickly reflect changes in a patient''s physiology and health and can be repeatedly
    used to continuously monitor without any burden to the patient. This opens up
    new possibilities for healthcare in regions with limited medical resources [141].

    which are intended to assess the condition of human health, as well as the quality
    of food and water, are shown. Download : Download high-res image (979KB) Download

    sensors that detect ammonia in order to assess the quality of water, food, and
    the health of living organisms. Among many different types of materials that have
    been used for the fabrication of ammonia gas sensors, metal-oxide-semiconductor
    (MOS)-based sensors are the most common materials because they have a high surface
    area to volume ratio, are chemically and thermally stable, and have high sensitivity
    and fast response [26]. When the sensing layer directly interacts with the target
    gas, it undergoes changes in its physical and/or chemical properties, leading
    to alterations in its conductivity or resistivity. The degree of change is directly
    related to the type and concentration of the gas. Most MOS-based sensors employ
    n-type materials, which exhibit heightened responsiveness when exposed to volatile
    substances with strong reducing abilities, like ammonia. When oxygen chemisorbs
    onto the surface of the sensing layer, its species vary depending on the operating
    temperature, being O2− at room temperature. Chemisorbed oxygen behaves as a surface
    acceptor, capturing free electrons from the conduction band, resulting in a depleted
    electron surface layer. Upon exposure to a reducing gas like NH3, the n-type material
    releases free electrons, leading to an expected increase in material conductivity
    [26,136]. As gas sensing relies on surface interactions, augmenting the material''s
    reactivity can be achieved by amplifying its specific surface area, commonly referred
    to as the surface-to-volume ratio. This enhancement can be accomplished by downsizing
    the structural dimensions to nanostructures like nanofibers and nanorods. Gas
    sensors are evaluated based on six performance criteria, which are sensitivity
    (response value), response time, recovery time, limit of detection (LoD), stability,
    and selectivity. To obtain the first three criteria, a dynamic cycle is employed.
    During this cycle, the gas sensor is exposed to a specific concentration of the
    target gas, such as NH3, for a period resulting in either a peak or minimum resistivity/conductivity
    value. Subsequently, the sensor returns to its baseline value by exposure to ambient
    air. The response value can be defined in two ways: (i) as the percentage ratio
    of the total resistance change over its initial pristine value in the air ( ),
    or (ii) as the ratio of baseline over peak magnitude and vice versa for n-type
    ( ) and p-type ( ) materials, respectively. The lowest amount of target gas that
    a sensor can quantify is called the limit of detection (LoD). To summarize, by
    employing nanoscale-engineering techniques on sensing films, it becomes feasible
    to attain ample sensitivity and a reduced Limit of Detection (LoD) within the
    low parts per billion (ppb) range. When evaluating sensing materials for a specific
    application like breath analysis where we have high relative humidity [142] and
    high relative analyte concentration in gas mixtures [96], it is important to do
    the characterization at realistic conditions. However, tests are frequently conducted
    under unrealistic conditions, using high concentrations of single analytes in
    a dry environment, which makes it difficult to accurately determine the true capabilities
    of a sensor for breath analysis in terms of their sensitivity and LOD. Some other
    factors used for describing the performance of the sensor, are response and recovery
    times that are defined as the time required the sensor to reach 90 % of the total
    change upon exposure to a target gas and air, respectively [143,144]. Finally,
    the evaluation of a gas sensor''s selectivity involves two main steps. Firstly,
    the sensor is exposed either to a gas mixture containing the desired gas and various
    interfering gases, or to individual interfering gases at specific concentrations.
    Subsequently, the selectivity is assessed by comparing the response values of
    the sensor to both the target gas and the interfering gases. A greater difference
    between these response values indicates a higher level of selectivity for the
    sensor. The primary obstacle in the design of breath sensors lies in achieving
    a considerable level of selectivity. This selectivity can be influenced by various
    factors, including the sensing material, arrays, and filters (as seen in Fig.
    10). To address this challenge, designers typically begin by testing the selectivity
    on individual gases and simplified gas mixtures that mimic breath composition,
    aiming to identify any potential interfering factors. Ultimately, the effectiveness
    of the sensor must be validated using real breath samples, with a statistically
    significant quantity, and compared to advanced technologies such as high-resolution
    mass spectrometers for verification [7]. Download : Download high-res image (416KB)

    nanomaterials 3.1. MOx-based Nanomaterials for pH Sensing pH measurements in health
    monitoring applications suggest the use of ion sensitive metal oxides (MOx) due
    to their high mechanical and chemical stability, usefulness for measuring body
    fluids, and high sensitivity. Besides their long lifetime in different conditions,
    they offer several other attractive features such as possibility of miniaturization
    and flexibility, low-cost fabrication, biocompatibility, and integration on various
    substrates. The morphology of metal oxides at the nanoscale significantly improves
    the performance of sensitive electrodes by increasing their sensitivity, response
    time, selectivity, and catalytic activity. This is primarily attributed to the
    high surface area to volume ratio of the nanostructures [146]. Additionally, when
    the pH sensor is intended for use in biological systems, specific factors must
    be carefully considered. These factors include preserving the organism''s life
    and understanding their impact on the sensing methodology [147]. Taken together,
    these considerations validate the appropriateness of using MOx as pH sensing materials.
    At the interface between the metal oxide and the solution, OH- groups as a consequence
    of their interaction cover the MOx surface. This gives rise to the creation of
    a Helmholtz layer, wherein H+ ions migrate towards the oxygen ions within the
    oxide''s crystal structure, while OH− ions move towards the cations. As a result,
    the metal-hydroxide groups have the option to either donate protons to the solution,
    creating negatively charged sites, or accept protons from the solution, resulting
    in positively charged sites. The release of protons results in the formation of
    oxide regions on the electrode, which generates a potential difference proportional
    to the solution pH. The magnitude of this potential difference can be determined
    using the Nernst equation [6,148]. This mechanism is called ion exchange in a
    surface containing –OH groups. The MOx sensors employ a second mechanism known
    as “oxygen intercalation”, which involves the reversible insertion of oxygen atoms
    into the MOx via pores and structural defects. This process causes a change in
    the electrochemical properties of the material through the doping and de-doping
    of charge carriers, which is consistent with the reported results [149,150]. In
    this review, our primary attention is directed towards the metal oxides that have
    received the most attention - RuO2 and IrO2. This is because they exhibit exceptional
    sensing capabilities across a broad range of pH values (2-12), such as high sensitivity,
    accuracy, and selectivity, along with their high chemical stability. All these
    features make them very suitable for health monitoring applications [6]. Table
    2 presents an overview of the most recent pH sensors based on MOx technology.

    increased FoM is achieved through improved sensitivity, reduced drift, minimized
    hysteresis, and faster response time. Numerous research works have reported the
    use of RuO2 and IrO2 either individually or in conjunction with other oxides or
    inert substances like carbon-based materials. Liao et al. [162] reported a pH
    sensor based on sputtered RuO2 electrode. The sensor shows near Nernstian response,
    55.64 mV/pH, in the pH range of 1–13 with response time ∼1 s and maximal hysteresis
    and drift of 4.36 mV and 0.38 mV/h, respectively. Moreover, they adopted four
    RuO2 sensing membrane ion-selective electrode (ISE) devices to form array sensors
    in a real-time measurement system, and to reduce the measurement error and testing
    time. Despite these advantages, the expensive cost of RuO2 would limit its frequent
    use for such an application. Therefore, doping/mixing of RuO2 with other metal
    oxides or inert materials would reduce the cost of RuO2 sensors and improve the
    flexibility of electrode for wearable applications where a high bendability is
    favorable. Accordingly, we developed a low cost and highly sensitive pH electrode
    by utilizing RuO2/graphene oxide (GO) nanocomposite [153]. The deposition of RuO2
    nanoparticles onto GO''s surface was achieved using the in-situ sol-gel technique,
    representing a simple, cost-effective, and eco-friendly approach. The oxygen functionalities
    present on the graphene oxide nanosheets acted as binding sites for anchoring
    RuO2. To achieve enhanced pH sensitivity, it was essential for the RuO2 nanoparticles
    to be of small size, possess a high specific surface area, and be uniformly distributed
    on the graphene oxide sheets. Thus, more metal oxide centers will be available
    as the sensing sites. The as-synthesized GO-RuO2 nanocomposites with a low volume
    were applied on the surface of screen-printed carbon paste. The obtained GO-RuO2
    nanocomposite pH sensor achieved high pH sensitivity (55.3 mV/pH) in the pH range
    of 4–10 with low hysteretic width and drift effect. These properties along with
    the green synthesis approach, where water and polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP) were
    used as the solvent and stabilizer, respectively, makes this novel material very
    promising for the mass production of high-performance electrochemical pH sensors.
    Using carbon-based materials, Xu and Zhang [58] deposited RuO2 onto MWCNTs that
    are vertically aligned using magnetron sputtering, for pH monitoring. Fig. 11(a)
    and (b) demonstrate the composition of the resulting composite, displaying the
    even distribution of tubular MWCNTs. An in-depth examination of the tubular cross-section,
    particularly near the edge of an individual tubular structure, shows the presence
    of a RuO2 layer. In Fig. 11(c), the newly created sensor demonstrates a response
    of 57 mV/pH, which closely aligns with the Nernstian response. However, when the
    sensor is immersed in a pH buffer solution of 7 for 24 h, the sensitivity reduces
    to 55 mV/pH. The influence of immersion time on sensitivity and Eo is illustrated
    in Fig. 11(d). According to the figure, after the 24-h immersion in a pH 7 environment,
    the Eo and sensitivity values largely remain stable. The initial changes in potential
    and sensitivity are attributed to hydration reactions occurring on the surface
    of the RuO2 electrode, a phenomenon also reported by Zhuiykov [163] and Manjakkal
    [67] on RuO2 based pH sensors. Download : Download high-res image (859KB) Download

    Measured sensitivity of IrOx flexible pH sensor from pH = 1.5 to pH = 12.1 [168].
    Other than carbon-based substances, one can combine a chemically unreactive oxide
    such as Ta2O5, TiO2, SnO2, etc., with an active transition metal oxide like RuO2,
    IrO2, etc., to create a binary MOx. This combination leads to reduced expenses
    and enhanced stability [164,165]. Pocrifka et al. [166] used TiO2 in order to
    develop a binary material, RuO2–TiO2, for pH sensing. They employed the Pechini
    method, which involves the thermal breakdown of a polymeric precursor with metallic
    cations, to manufacture the sensor at a low temperature, 130 for 30 min. The resulting
    sensor exhibited a sensitivity of 56 mV/pH and demonstrated good stability. In
    another study, Ta2O5 was introduced into RuO2 structure because as a proton-conducting
    solid, it would help more protons to be inserted between the lattice points at
    the surface of RuO2 grains [167]. The nanostructures of the screen-printed electrode
    with a porous morphology and high specific surface area create more pH sensing
    centers that serve to improve the performance characteristics of the sensor in
    terms of higher sensitivity (−56 ± 0.8 mV/pH), faster response time, and less
    power consumed. After RuO2, IrO2 is the second most widely used and investigated
    pH sensitive material. Compared to RuO2 and other metal oxides, it is widely acknowledged
    that IrO2 has greater chemical stability in alkaline solutions. It is also shown
    that it has a greater selectivity upon exposure to interfering ions, faster response
    time, and stability over a wide pH range for longer periods of time [6]. On the
    other hand, as IrO2 can undergo various degrees of hydration, ranging from partial
    to complete hydration, there may be inconsistencies in terms of the prevalence
    of redox reactions on the sensor''s surface and its pH sensitivities. Typically,
    IrOx exhibits a sensitivity that is close to Nernstian at approximately 59 mV/pH
    [154]. Nevertheless, when hydrated, the Nernstian response will be multiplied
    by 1.5, thereby enabling a maximum pH response of 88.74 mV/pH [169]. The properties
    of IrOx sensors are highly responsive to the film''s structure and composition,
    influenced by the fabrication process. In consideration of these factors, Katsube
    et al. [170] investigated a pH sensor utilizing a metal-MOx configuration, specifically
    employing an IrO2 film deposited via the sputtering method on various substrates
    such as titanium and tantalum. The sensing electrode demonstrated stability in
    aqueous solutions at temperatures reaching 200 °C. Notably, films sputtered onto
    stainless steel and tantalum substrates exhibited a Nernstian response with a
    slope factor of 59 mV/pH. The study revealed that the electrochemical reactions
    at the IrO2 film, prepared through sputtering and anodization methods, differed
    due to variations in the film''s structure. The sol-gel technique offers a more
    straightforward and cost-effective method for the low-temperature production of
    iridium oxide films. In their work, Nishio et al. [171] utilized a dip coating
    process to create IrO2 films. They used iridium chloride in the solution preparation
    for the formation of working electrode, and the resulting film underwent heat
    treatment at 300 °C. Following Nishio et al.''s approach, Huang et al. [168] designed
    a flexible IrO2 pH sensor on a polymeric substrate, as depicted in Fig. 11(e).
    This sensor demonstrated a sensitivity of 51.1 mV/pH within the pH range of 1.5–12
    at 25 °C, as shown in Fig. 11(f) [168]. Notably, the flexible sensor exhibited
    remarkable characteristics, including sensitivity, response time, stability, reversibility,
    repeatability, and selectivity [168]. Based on this work, Nguyen et al. [172]
    employed the sol-gel method to create a pH sensor array. This array consisted
    of sixteen individual sensors (Solid Electrolyte based on IrO2 and Reference Electrode
    based on Ag/AgCl) on a single flexible polyamide substrate. To map pH values across
    the surface, a thick layer of PDMS polymer with 4 × 4 punched-out wells (diameter:
    5 mm) was positioned on top of the sensor surface. The sensors were affixed to
    the outer surface of a plastic tube (radius: 3.5 cm) to prevent the test solutions
    from mixing. The developed sensor array exhibited sensitivity close to Nernstian
    responses within the range of 57.0–63.4 mV/pH [172]. Wang et al. [173] introduced
    an innovative technique termed ‘carbonate melt oxidation’ for fabricating a durable
    iridium pH electrode through chemical oxidation. This method involves coating
    iridium metal wire with a consistent iridium oxide film achieved by oxidizing
    the wire in a carbonate melt. The resulting pH sensor demonstrates exceptional
    sensitivity and prolonged stability across a broad pH spectrum. Notably, it is
    well-suited for continuous pH monitoring, eliminating the necessity for frequent
    recalibration. The Ir salts are more expensive compared to Ru salts. In an effort
    to reduce the cost of IrO2 working electrode, Da Silva et al. [174] employed a
    cost-effective approach. They created a binary oxide, IrO2–TiO2, using the polymeric
    precursor method for sensor fabrication. By varying the composition of IrO2–TiO2
    with (one hundred–0), (70–30), (30–70), and (20–80) mol%, they developed solid
    electrolytes on titanium substrates. Notably, the electrode based on IrO2–TiO2
    (30–70) mol% exhibited exceptional sensitivity, rapid response, and reproducibility
    in the pH range of 1–13 [174]. 3.2. MOx-based nanomaterials for temperature sensing
    The high temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR) of MOx would improve their
    sensing performance, making them a potential candidate for applications where
    high sensitivity and high resolution are needed. The thermal sensitivity of metal
    oxide semiconductors is a phenomenon in which the resistance value of the material
    changes with temperature [175]. Vanadium oxide (VO2) and nickel oxide (NiO) are
    among the materials that have been extensively investigated. Table 3 shows overview
    of the most recent temperature sensors based on MOx technology. Table 3. Properties
    of MOx based electrical temperature sensors. Material Fabrication method Response

    VO2 Transfer printing 1.12 % −1 -3–46 – 2(8) [183] 2017 VO2 has attracted considerable
    interest in different products such as thermometers, smart windows, and microbolometers,
    due to its reversible phase transition caused by various stimuli such as thermal
    [176], electrical [177], and optical stimuli [178]. It undergoes an insulator-to-metal
    transition (IMT) at around 68 , where at a temperature lower than the IMT temperature,
    it is an insulator with the monoclinic structure, and above that temperature,
    it transforms into a metal with a tetragonal structure. There is a huge change
    in its electrical conductivity of several orders of magnitude as a result of this
    phase transition, making VOx a potential candidate for many temperature sensing
    applications [179]. However, its IMT temperature is dependent on its composition
    (doped/undoped and grain size) [180], film thickness [181], and annealing atmosphere
    [182]. Considering the application of VO2 as temperature sensors in the field
    of health monitoring application with wearable sensor to control the body temperature,
    to food and water quality systems, we are dealing with a temperature range in
    the order of 0–50 . Although this range of temperature is not close to the IMT
    temperature, different studies have shown its capability for temperature monitoring
    with high sensitivity and accuracy. Liao et al. [183] developed a flexible temperature-mechanical
    dual-parameter sensor based on a PET/VO2/PDMS multilayer structure. The sensor
    with ultra high mechanical sensitivity to strain in the range of 0%–0.1 % and
    high temperature resolution of 0.1 K was fabricated using the transfer printing
    technique (Fig. 12(a)). The sensor with a negative TCR presented the change in
    resistance with increasing the temperature from 270 K to 320 K as shown in Fig.
    12(b). The inset of Fig. 12(b) displays the resistance-time curve under a temperature
    gradient of 0.1 K. Next, the independent mechanical sensing performance of the
    sensor was studied by obtaining the cyclic variations in resistance when the sensor
    was loaded and unloaded using a bending apparatus (Fig. 12(c)). Finally, the developed
    sensor was attached to the wrist of a healthy adult male in order to evaluate
    its simultaneous temperature and mechanical sensing abilities. As shown in Fig.
    12(d) and the inset, temperature and pulse signals at the wrist are quite distinguishable.
    In order to separate the mechanical and temperature signals, the frequency characteristics
    of the time domain signals were computed. According to Fig. 12(e), the peaks at
    1.43 Hz, 2.86 Hz, 4.29 Hz, 5.72 Hz and 7.15 Hz in the frequency spectrum are the
    main frequency related to the wrist motion, while the frequency lower than 1 Hz
    shown in the inset of Fig. 12(e) represents the change of temperature. Therefore,
    by using a low-pass and a high-pass filter with a cut-off frequency at 1 Hz, temperature
    and mechanical signals have been extracted, as shown in Fig. 12(f) and (g); respectively.
    This sensor with temperature and mechanical capabilities may be used for monitoring
    real-time pulse and body surface temperature. Download : Download high-res image

    (g) Real-time pulse signals [183]. NiO is another metal oxide with a negative
    temperature coefficient, large TCR, and great chemical stability [[184], [185],
    [186]]. Huang et al. [187] developed a NiO-based temperature sensor using the
    inkjet printing process in order to accurately map the temperature changes of
    the body surface. The change in the electrical resistance in accordance with the
    temperature variation of the printed sensor has been well characterized by changing
    the temperature in the range of room temperature to 200 . Showing no thermal hysteresis,
    fast response time, high temperature sensitivity, along with the bendability of
    the sensor confirms its ability to measure temperature distributions with high
    precision. Further, applicability of solution- or printing-based processes for
    the fabrication of miniaturized flexible sensing devices instead of the traditional/expensive
    coating processes was shown. As it was explained earlier, the pH value is highly
    dependent on temperature according to Nernst equation (Eq. 7). Therefore, for
    the accurate pH measurement when there are temperature fluctuations, an integrated
    sensor arrays including pH and temperature sensors is highly recommended. Using
    palladium/palladium oxide (Pd/PdO), Qin et al. [193] developed an integrated water
    quality monitoring system with pH, temperature, and free chlorine sensors (Fig.
    13(a)). The temperature sensor was inkjet printed onto the glass substrate using
    Pd ink. The printed substrate was then subjected to thermolysis at 200 °C for
    20 min in a low-vacuum chamber, followed by oxidation in air at 200 °C for 48
    h to create PdO-rich films. These resulting films were utilized as two thermistors,
    which exhibit a negative temperature coefficient of resistance, in a Wheatstone-bridge-based
    temperature sensor (see Fig. 13(b)). To evaluate the sensor''s performance, its
    temporal response was measured in water between 0 and 50 °C, which is a suitable
    range for various water quality monitoring applications. As depicted in Fig. 13(c),
    the output voltage demonstrates a rapid and linear response to temperature changes,
    highlighting its potential for real-time pH sensor compensation. The sensitivity
    and hysteresis of the sensor were calculated using the temporal response with
    the values of around 3.35 mV/ and 0.93 mV (corresponding to a resolution of 0.28
    ), respectively (Fig. 13(c) and (d)). To assess the sensor''s long-term stability,
    its drift behavior was examined by immersing it in water at 25 °C and storing
    it in darkness. Throughout the entire test duration of approximately 18 h, the
    drift rate measured 1.24 mV per hour (refer to Fig. 13(e)). Download : Download

    behavior of the temperature sensor at 25 in water in dark [193]. The extensive
    research on metal oxide-based temperature sensors has laid the foundation for
    their application in the field of flexible temperature sensing based on their
    thermal properties. 3.3. MOx-based Nanomaterials for Ammonia Gas Sensing MOS-based
    sensors are among the most widely used available gas sensitive materials, due
    to their high stability, low cost, easy fabrication, and most importantly, the
    possibility of tuning their physical and chemical properties to meet specific
    application requirements. Because of these reasons, MOS-based sensors are a very
    favorable option for gas detection. However, despite all these advantages, they
    suffer from the inherent drawback of poor selectivity and low sensitivity, especially
    at room temperature. Also, functioning at high temperatures makes them incompatible
    for health monitoring systems [194]. Hence, developing a remarkably sensitive
    sensor with rapid response and recovery rates, while maintaining a low operating
    temperature and long-term stability, is essential for secure and efficient gas
    sensing, particularly for substances like NH3 during in-situ monitoring. Moreover,
    this sensor''s lower power consumption would enable its application in self-powered
    devices, where alternative energy sources like mechanical and thermal energies
    can be harnessed and converted into electrical energy. Consequently, the concept
    of a self-powered sensor with the desired bias voltage becomes feasible, given
    that the nanogenerator already exhibits gas sensing capabilities [195]. Until
    now, only a limited number of metal oxides have been utilized in low-temperature
    NH3 gas sensing. These challenges can be overcome by modifying the MOS layers
    through physical [196,197] (e.g., geometry and size) and chemical [198,199](e.g.,
    doping) strategies. The initial approach to enhance gas sensing properties involves
    physical modification, wherein reducing the structure size from micro to nanoscale
    significantly increases the specific surface area and active sites for oxygen
    adsorption. For example, Van Duy et al. [196] designed a room temperature ammonia
    gas sensor utilizing p-type-like V2O5 nanosheets. Due to their small thickness
    and high porosity, these nanosheets prove to be efficient sensors for detecting
    ammonia at room temperature. When exposed to 5 ppm ammonia (NH3), the sensors
    exhibit a relative change in resistance of 9.4 %, and they can even detect ammonia
    as low as 0.4 ppm. Due to its affordability, ease of use, and reliable sensing
    capabilities, this sensor has the potential to be used for continuous tracking
    of ammonia levels, such as in breath monitoring, as well as evaluating the quality
    of food throughout its production and distribution process. In another study,
    an inorganic two-dimensional material, MoSe2, which is capable of detecting ammonia
    at low temperature, was used [197]. MoSe2 falls under the classification of 2D
    substances referred to as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). These materials
    are generally denoted by the formula MX2, where M represents either Mo or W, and
    X can stand for elements like S, Se, or Te. Recently, these TMDCs have gained
    a lot of attention because of their interesting physical properties, which are
    dependent on the number of layers. One notable distinction separating TMDCs from
    graphene is their inherent bandgap, which shifts from being indirect to direct
    when transitioning from a bulk to a monolayer structure. This characteristic,
    combined with their considerable surface-to-volume ratio, renders TMDCs an appealing
    option for gas sensing applications under room temperature conditions [[200],
    [201], [202], [203]]. The developed sensor has the ability to detect ammonia at
    a level as low as 1 ppm. In addition, it has demonstrated fast response and recovery
    times (tresponse = 15 s and trecovery = 135 s). These fast times may be due to
    the lower adsorption energy and the presence of different defects in the processed
    MoSe2 nanosheets compared to the pristine version [197]. In the case of chemical
    modification, the main approaches are the incorporation of noble metals as modifiers
    [204] or the use of hybrid MOS [198,205,206]. Modification with metal nanoparticles
    not only results in randomly distributed Schottky junctions at the interface,
    but it also promotes the catalytic dissociation of molecular oxygen species. The
    resulting oxygen atoms migrate onto the sensor surface and form oxygen ions by
    capturing the free electrons, thus creating more active sites for the adsorption
    of both oxygen and the test gas on the sensor surface. Therefore, the gas sensor''s
    response is governed by two main factors: 1. Number of active sites for the adsorption
    of oxygen and the test gas. 2. Reactivity of the test gas [207]. In a study by
    Wu et al., how the percentage of Ce doping affects the sensing capabilities of
    TiO2 nanostructures was investigated [199]. They found that as the concentration
    of Ce doping increased (from 0.17 to 0.43 at%), there was a corresponding increase
    in the specific surface area and pore volume according to Brunauer-Emmett-Teller
    (BET) analysis. TiO2 nanocrystals doped with 0.43 mol% Ce showed the best NH3
    sensing performance at room temperature, with high response (23.99 @ 20 ppm) and
    a limit of detection of 140 ppb. The enhanced efficiency was linked to various
    factors. These included the greater surface area that offered additional adsorption
    sites, the reduced gap between NH3 molecules and the surface as depicted in Fig.
    14(a), and an increase in oxygen vacancies, which enhanced the donor effect (Fig.
    14(b)). The sensor was also tested practically by detecting amine gas from fish
    spoilage using Ce–TiO2 nanocrystal gas sensor. The sensor showed increased response
    as NH3 concentration increased, indicating the fish spoilage after 12 h of storage
    (Fig. 14(c)). In recent times, considerable attention has been devoted to investigating
    composite materials, which have displayed promising outcomes in advancing sensor
    technology owing to their high sensitivity, detection limit, and capacity to operate
    effectively at room temperature. The appeal of composite materials lies in their
    ability to amalgamate advantageous traits from their individual components, resulting
    in sensors that outperform those relying solely on single phases [205,208,209].
    Using this scheme, Shi et al. [206] have developed a highly sensitive electrode,
    named TiO2-PANI/SFF, by combining TiO2, polyaniline, and silk fibroin fiber for
    ammonia detection at ambient conditions. The TiO2-PANI/SFF sensor exhibited successful
    detection of 100 mg/L NH3, yielding a response value of 0.82 and an impressive
    10-s response time. Furthermore, the sensor displayed a direct relationship with
    TVB-N levels in pork meat, underscoring its capability for monitoring meat freshness.

    (f) Illustration of SiO2:ZnO nanofibers with SWCNTs attached to a readily accessible
    RFID Tag, depicting changes in radiofrequency signal reaction upon exposure to
    ammonia derivatives [208]. In another work, Singh et al. [198] created an effective
    ammonia sensor at room temperature by employing a MoS2/SnO2 composite that was
    synthesized through hydrothermal methods. The distinct properties of two-dimensional
    layered transition metal dichalcogenides, such as their semiconducting behavior
    and significant surface-to-volume ratio, have facilitated their application in
    gas detection. However, their sensing abilities due to long recovery times and
    incomplete recovery have been a problem. To address these two limitations, a composite-based
    approach was developed. This involves a simple double-step synthesis of a MoS2/SnO2
    composite, which has been shown to be a superior ammonia sensor at room temperature.
    Compared to sensors made solely from nanosheets, the composite-based sensors display
    faster response times and better sensing properties. The sensor that utilized
    composites demonstrated impressive sensitivity, achieving a notable 10 % sensitivity
    even when detecting extremely low levels of ammonia at 0.4 ppm. Additionally,
    its response and recovery times were recorded at 2 and 10 s, respectively. Naderi
    et al. developed a sensor using marigold flower-like V2O5/CuWO4 heterojunctions
    [209]. The sensing properties of the sensitive layer was significantly improved
    after sensitizing by Au nanoparticles. The sensor, which was enhanced with gold,
    demonstrated quick response (within a few seconds) and exhibited high sensitivity
    to ammonia while effectively distinguishing it from other types of VOCs. When
    the sensor was tested at a temperature of 150 °C, it was able to detect ammonia
    at concentrations as low as 212 ppb and had a linear range of 5–158 ppm, making
    it suitable for detecting exhaled breath ammonia in patients with end-stage chronic
    kidney disease. Other than the ammonia measurement through exhaled breath for
    diagnosis of diseases, measurement of elevated ammonia observed in human blood
    or plasma is an indicator of malfunctioning of the liver. The typical amount of
    ammonia present in the venous blood of individuals who are healthy is approximately
    30 μM [210]. However, even a slight elevation in the concentration of ammonia
    above the normal level can result in changes in mood or memory loss [211]. A sudden
    rise in blood ammonia levels beyond the normal level can lead to irreversible
    brain damage or potentially fatal consequences [211]. As a result, it is crucial
    to monitor blood or plasma ammonia levels regularly, particularly in these disorders,
    through early, frequent, or online monitoring. Accordingly, Sharma et al. developed
    a highly responsive FET biosensor based on WO3 to monitor the concentration of
    total ammonia (ammonium NH4+ and NH3) [212]. The developed FET device has demonstrated
    its accuracy in sensing ammonia, showing a peak response of 498 at a concentration
    of 100 μM and a detection limit as low as 6 μM. This apparatus enables quicker
    measurement of ammonia levels in bodily fluids compared to existing techniques
    and exhibits a robust reaction to ammonia presence in commercially accessible
    human plasma. Furthermore, it has the capability to instantly detect exceedingly
    low concentrations of ammonia (2 μM) across a broad range spanning from 2 to 100
    μM. Additionally, the device''s potential for mass production was demonstrated,
    and it consistently performs with high stability. Overall, this research presents
    a reliable and consistent sensing platform that can directly detect ammonia levels
    in human plasma, making it suitable for point-of-care applications. Materials
    that alter their electrical conductivity when exposed to organic volatile substances,
    like ammonia, can be integrated with communication circuitry to develop wireless
    chemiresistive sensors. These sensors transmit and receive information through
    electromagnetic waves in the radiofrequency (RF) range [213,214]. They are often
    used for applications such as breath analysis, food safety, homeland security,
    and law enforcement. To make these sensors practical and accessible, they need
    to be lightweight, easy to use, and affordable. One option is to use commercially
    available RFID tags, which are flexible and have a communication antenna and microchip
    transponder that can store and process data, modulate and demodulate the RF signal
    [215,216]. A specific technology presented in Ref. [204] facilitates wireless
    identification of ammonia and biogenic amines (specifically putrescine and cadaverine)
    using chip-less tags that operate within the ultrahigh frequency range, approximately
    1000 MHz In this method, layers of molybdenum disulfide nanosheets adorned with
    silver nanoparticles are applied onto a copper magnetron sputtered nested split-ring
    resonator (SRR) using shadow masks, as depicted in Fig. 14(d). These tags offer
    several notable benefits, including a low limit of detection (less than 1 ppm
    for ammonia), heightened sensitivity, rapid responsiveness, and the ability to
    withstand varying environmental and directional conditions. Unlike conventional
    approaches that rely on assessing the antenna reflection coefficient (S11) to
    gauge responses, this technology measures the resonant frequency, requiring employment
    of a network analyzer and subsequent processing of output data. While these sensors
    are more complex compared to the binary outcomes generated by NFC and mobile phones,
    they effectively identify spoilage by detecting the presence of 20 mg of TVB-N
    (total volatile basic nitrogen) per 100 g of diverse meat types (such as pork,
    mutton, beef, and chicken), as illustrated in Fig. 14(e). Furthermore, the technology
    has been demonstrated in a poultry farm to monitor the levels of biogenic amines
    and ammonia in the atmosphere. In another work, wireless sensors that use a combination
    of SiO2:ZnO nanofiber/SWCNTs structures (shown in Fig. 14(f)) were developed [208].
    These sensors are highly sensitive to amines, with a dosimetric sensitivity about
    40 times higher than other volatile organic compounds (VOCs). They can detect
    amines quantitatively at very low concentrations of 2.5 ppm. The sensors were
    tested successfully for detecting biogenic amines that are produced during the
    spoilage of different types of meat, such as beef, chicken, and fish. The response
    of the sensors was particularly strong for chicken meat, which tends to emit amines
    that are more volatile during putrefaction. By monitoring the changes in the NFC
    signal resulting from the spoilage of chicken meat stored at room temperature
    for 72 h, the sensor was able to switch a mobile phone from the “on” state to
    the “off” state. This demonstrates that such a wireless sensor is a low-cost and
    effective way to monitor the quality of food. For meat stored at 4 °C, it took
    longer for the NFC signal to attenuate completely using a mobile phone, indicating
    that the spoilage process was delayed when lower storage temperatures were used.

    in this review include: 1) the importance of each analyte to be sensed along with
    the sensing mechanism; (2) the design and components of each sensor; and 3) additional
    challenges and future perspectives for these sensors. The sensors discussed in
    this article require improvements in their reliability and lifespan for real-world
    applications. When designing sensors for health monitoring applications, it is
    important to ensure that they are accurate and suitable for the specific application.
    However, it is worth noting that most of the devices studied in this article were
    proof-of-concept prototypes and were tested in ideal laboratory conditions, meaning
    that they may not perform as effectively in real-world situations. Further, hysteresis
    of the sensor, whether in real world or testing environment, determines how accurate
    the sensor is – a lower hysteretic width translates into a more accurate sensor.
    Also, the drift effect of the sensor in order to have a stable response over a
    certain period of time, should be minimized. 4.1. Safety and biocompatibility
    Electrochemical-biomedical sensors can provide needed information in applications
    including point of care diagnostics, food and environmental monitoring, industrial
    monitoring, and wireless/remote health monitoring. Considering the vital role
    of these sensing devices in improving public health, their safety and security
    is quite important [232]. The crucial aspects lie in the safety and adaptability
    of wearable sensing platforms, as these gadgets are designed to remain in touch
    with the user''s skin and body for prolonged durations while conforming to their
    everyday schedules. Moreover, they should not impose any new safety risks or restrictions
    on the user''s lifestyle [[233], [234], [235], [236]]. The advancements in flexible
    electronics and the utilization of organic biomaterials like silk, chitin, sodium
    alginate, and cellulose, both as functional components and supportive structures
    in flexible sensing systems, have played a significant role in the rapid development
    of wearable devices that are easy for users to interact with [237,238]. These
    substrates that are both biocompatible and flexible act as a bridge connecting
    integrated sensors with the user''s skin, effectively preventing any skin irritation
    [239]. However, it is challenging to predict the interaction between a single
    substance and the human body due to the complex biological reactions that can
    occur. Apart from the substrate, electrodes, and sensitive material, wearable
    devices usually have additional components like a wireless communication system,
    a microcontroller, and a power source. The complexity of these systems may lead
    to unforeseen safety hazards. For example, numerous wearable devices include metallic
    elements like electrodes, network connectors, or conductive fabrics, which could
    lead to allergic responses or the accumulation of bacteria on the skin following
    extended periods of contact. We also need to consider the specific manufacturing
    process, which can change biocompatible materials, resulting in devices that are
    not biocompatible or unsafe. Moreover, wearable sensors that incorporate electronic
    circuitry may generate high operating temperatures because of their fast-switching
    speeds or high frequency operation. Although occasional usage with elevated temperatures
    may not pose any harm, prolonged exposure to elevated temperatures can lead to
    burns or tissue damage. In addition, it is essential to consider the possibility
    of electrical shock due to current leakage from circuitry that is worn or damaged
    [38]. However, it is possible to avoid any potential safety hazards associated
    with wearable devices through careful design and subsequent safety evaluations.
    ISO 10993 stands as a biocompatibility measure established by the International
    Organization for Standardization (ISO), which serves to assess the safety of instruments
    that regularly come into contact with human tissue. Despite having established
    standards and guidelines for biocompatibility testing, product safety is frequently
    given the least amount of attention in the fast-paced world of consumer wearables
    [38]. Considering the use of metal oxides for the fabrication of pH, temperature,
    and ammonia sensors, their flexibility and biocompatibility are of concern. In
    order to tackle the concerns mentioned earlier, one potential solution could be
    to mix these oxides with other substances, such as biocompatible conductive materials
    or inert oxides [[240], [241], [242], [243]]. For example, ZnO and TiO2 are widely
    used metal oxides with excellent biocompatibility and low toxicity. Mixing RuO2
    or IrO2 with ZnO or TiO2 can enhance the stability and biocompatibility of the
    resulting composite material. They also offer good electrical properties and have
    been utilized in various sensor applications. By incorporating ZnO and TiO2 into
    the sensor design, you can potentially improve its performance and reduce any
    adverse effects associated with pure metal oxides [67,166]. 4.2. Performance metrics
    4.2.1. Sensitivity Considering the health monitoring applications for the developed
    sensors, there is an increased demand for accurate monitoring of the pH values
    of the package of food, water, and body fluids. In terms of the temperature and
    breath analysis for ammonia detection, the small range suitable for each target
    also highlights the importance of having a high-sensitivity sensor. As we are
    focusing on the use of metal oxides such as RuO2, IrO2, and PdO for the development
    of pH sensors, they all achieve Nernstian limits or near Nernstian limits. The
    high temperature coefficient of resistance of metal oxide materials such as vanadium
    oxide and nickel oxide used for the fabrication of temperature sensors would improve
    their temperature sensing performance e.g., sensitivity. On the other hand, using
    metal oxides for the fabrication of ammonia sensors makes it difficult to have
    a highly sensitive sensor at room temperature for detection of sub-ppm levels
    of NH3. They mostly need a high operating temperature that would negatively affect
    the long-term stability of the material and the application of the developed sensor
    for health monitoring systems. To address this issue, incorporation of metal nanoparticles
    or having a p-n junction would increase the sensitivity of the material at low
    temperatures. By incorporating metal nanoparticles into metal oxide-based ammonia
    sensors, the operating temperature can be significantly reduced. Metal nanoparticles
    act as catalysts, facilitating the gas sensing process at lower temperatures.
    They enhance the surface reactions, improve the adsorption and desorption kinetics,
    and improve both the sensitivity and selectivity of the sensors. The metal nanoparticles
    can be dispersed within the metal oxide matrix or deposited on its surface. They
    provide additional active sites for gas interaction, leading to enhanced sensing
    performance [194,199,204]. Another approach is p-n junction. By incorporating
    semiconducting materials, the p-n junction reduces the operating temperature while
    maintaining or even enhancing the sensor''s performance. This temperature reduction
    is achieved through several mechanisms. Firstly, the p-n junction creates a depletion
    region, resulting in improved sensitivity. When exposed to ammonia gas, the interaction
    between the gas and the p-n junction causes changes in the electrical properties,
    leading to variations in the sensor''s output. This allows for sensitive detection
    even at lower temperatures. Secondly, semiconducting materials in the p-n junction
    generate more carriers (electrons and holes) under lower energy input, enhancing
    the sensor''s sensitivity and response. Consequently, the sensor can detect lower
    concentrations of ammonia at reduced operating temperatures. Moreover, the presence
    of a p-n junction decreases the activation energy required for the chemical reactions
    involved in the sensing process. This enables the ammonia sensor to operate effectively
    at lower temperatures, as the chemical reactions occur more readily and efficiently.
    Additionally, the p-n junction improves the selectivity of the ammonia sensor.
    The unique electronic properties, such as energy bandgap and charge carrier mobility,
    enable specific interactions with ammonia molecules, resulting in distinct electrical
    responses. This enhanced selectivity allows the sensor to discriminate between
    ammonia and other gases [198,205,206]. By combining these factors, the p-n junction
    structure in ammonia sensors offers the advantage of reduced operating temperature
    without sacrificing sensitivity, response time, or selectivity. This advancement
    holds the potential for more energy-efficient and cost-effective ammonia detection
    in various applications. 4.2.2. Selectivity A significant limitation associated
    with the utilization of a pH sensor based on metal oxide is that the existence
    of diverse ions within a solution can affect the sensor''s capacity to precisely
    assess pH levels. This interference can result in various reactions occurring,
    affecting the sensor''s measured potential in both acidic and basic pH ranges.
    However, the effect of common anions (Cl−, Br−, SO42−) and cations (Li+, Na+,
    K+, Ca2+) on the sensor''s performance is usually negligible in most metal oxide-based
    pH sensors [167,244,245]. Also, based on published results, it is evident that
    commercially made sensitive electrodes using pastes are vulnerable to interference
    from common anions such as halide, sulfate, and carbonate ions. This interference
    arises from the inclusion of lead in the working electrode (WE) [60]. In this
    regard, Zhuiykov [246] developed a novel sensing material using Bi2Ru2O7+x-RuO2.
    This material was designed for continuous tracking of water pH. However, the use
    of a sensing electrode containing standard RuO2 paste often results in reduced
    specificity, particularly when halide, sulfate, and carbonate ions are present.
    This lack of specificity can be attributed to the incorporation of lead within
    the conventional RuO2 paste. The new material developed in Ref. [246] reduces
    the amount of lead, thereby preventing its negative influence on measurement results.
    This advancement allowed for better accuracy and more selective pH sensing. An
    alternative approach to enhance the specificity of pH sensors involves the use
    of an ion-selective membrane along with an anti-fouling coating. Biofouling is
    a common issue that affects water quality monitoring devices, leading to reduced
    sensor efficiency. This fouling layer can hinder the redox reaction between the
    sensing material and H3O+ or obstruct the adsorption of H3O+ onto the sensor surface
    [14]. Kinlen et al. introduced a novel approach for designing a pH sensor. They
    utilized an IrO2 electrode coated with Nafion, along with a polymer-altered Ag/AgCl
    reference electrode. The Nafion layer on the IrO2 surface was endowed with specificity
    for cations following annealing, granting it pH sensitivity while curbing disruptions
    from anions. The polymer-driven reference electrode entrapped Cl− ions in its
    polymer stratum, enclosed by an external Nafion layer. Post-annealing, the Nafion
    membrane effectively barred Cl− diffusion into the testing solution, upholding
    constant Cl− activity on the AgCl surface and an unvarying electrode potential.
    This approach tackles a pivotal hurdle encountered by pH sensors rooted in metal
    oxides, mitigating susceptibility to redox agents in the solution and thereby
    augmenting pH measurement precision [247]. The impact of mechanical stimuli on
    the accuracy of temperature sensors remains a persistent challenge, especially
    for wearable sensors and food quality monitoring systems. Temperature sensors''
    design must guarantee conformity to curved surfaces and provide precise and reliable
    measurements while accommodating the user''s natural movements and comfort in
    wearable devices. Therefore, the ability of flexible sensors to conform to the
    skin''s surface is a crucial factor. However, the reliability of flexible temperature
    sensors can be compromised due to strain or stress induced by human body movements
    [248]. One approach to address this issue is to use highly flexible thermo-plastic
    polymers such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) or polyurethane (PU), as well
    as silicone elastomers like PDMS [249,250]. The other approach is using metal
    oxides with dual characteristics of being temperature and mechanical sensitive.
    For example, vanadium oxide is used for developing a dual-parameter sensor in
    which the signals simultaneously were recorded [183]. With the use of ammonia
    gas sensor both for analysis of exhaled breath and monitoring the gas emission
    from the package of food, the most challenging part is the selective detection
    of the target marker in the complex human breath (>800 compounds)/food environment.
    Most chemiresistive sensors face the difficulty of selectivity because the chemical
    reactions they utilize are commonly not specific to only one chemical compound,
    including those that involve redox reactions. One potential solution involves
    utilizing an electronic nose, composed of an array of sensors that collectively
    generate distinct response patterns for each vapor being analyzed. This strategy
    offers a level of selectivity that a solitary sensor cannot achieve [8]. To illustrate,
    a recent instance employed an assortment of metal oxide sensors to differentiate
    between three distinct lung diseases [251]. This approach holds interest due to
    the compact and cost-effective device achieved by combining multiple small and
    reasonably priced sensors. Another approach involves incorporating a filter (such
    as zeolite or polymers [252,253]) to enhance the selectivity of gas sensors. Lastly,
    in certain scenarios, it may be feasible to carry out a control experiment within
    an identical environment and on the same individual. This technique facilitates
    the identification of discrepancies between two measurements, focusing on differences
    rather than relying solely on an absolute value against a background comprising
    a variety of components. 4.2.3. Humidity effect Humidity stability is another
    challenge for ammonia and temperature sensors. Many temperature sensors fail in
    maintaining stable electrical characteristics due to factors such as swelling
    from humidity or irreversible chemical or structural changes caused by heating
    and cooling [254,255]. To address this issue, selecting an appropriate binder
    can provide stability for the sensitive material under different environmental
    conditions. Binders such as Benzocyclobutene (BCB)-based resins are a good option
    as they have low moisture absorption and possess excellent dielectric, chemical,
    and thermal stability [256,257]. Examining the detection of ammonia in exhaled
    breath, an average breath sample generally holds approximately 80–90 % relative
    humidity. Should the sensor being developed possess sensitivity to humidity, it
    gives rise to two challenges. Firstly, the lack of selectivity may make it problematic
    to distinguish between the substantial signal generated by water vapor and the
    weaker signal produced by the target molecule. The second problem is that water
    molecules may saturate the sensor by blocking all reactive sites, which then prevents
    interaction with the intended target gas. Employing an electronic nose can alleviate
    problems caused by humidity if they arise due to a lack of selectivity. However,
    if high humidity levels are causing sensor saturation, additional solutions are
    required. One solution is to using sample preparation techniques such as utilizing
    a desiccant or covering the sensor surface with a selectively permeable layer
    [258]. In addition, to mitigate problems caused by elevated humidity levels, another
    option is to operate the sensor at a higher temperature, but this option is not
    suitable for wearable applications. For instance, to prevent the high relative
    humidity of a sample from interfering with an ammonia breath analysis sensor,
    a sodium hydroxide filter was placed between the sample inlet and the sensor [259].
    Sodium hydroxide has a high affinity for water vapor and readily absorbs it from
    the surrounding environment. By passing the gas through a sodium hydroxide filter,
    the water vapor present in the gas is effectively removed or significantly reduced.
    The utilization of the sodium hydroxide filter resulted in consistent conductance
    levels even when the relative humidity levels were altered. The effectiveness
    of the sodium hydroxide filter was demonstrated not only in eliminating the impact
    of humidity but also in preventing any potential interference caused by subsequent
    reaction as below: (10) 4.3. Fabrication and cost The use of high temperatures
    in the processing of metal oxide-based sensors has been a common practice [22,123,260].
    While this method is suitable for stand-alone sensors and certain applications,
    it poses a challenge for wearable or packaged food sensors that utilize PET as
    the substrate material. This is due to PET''s low glass transition temperature
    (Tg), making annealing or sintering impractical for pH-sensitive materials, which
    must be deposited, cast, or printed under conditions that do not exceed PET''s
    Tg. To address this concern, one approach involves modifying the binding agent
    in the mixture to maintain the materials'' conductivity while also acting as an
    adhesive between the MOx material and the PET substrate. Additionally, using high
    temperatures in post-deposition treatments like screen-printing or sol-gel may
    cause issues for PET-based food packaging. Since PET''s melting point is 260 °C,
    annealing at high temperatures is not advisable. Instead, it is preferred to directly
    deposit the sensitive material itself, eliminating the need for an extra annealing
    procedure, unlike the precursor deposition method. Other than the fabrication
    methods, another challenge with sensors is related to their costs. To maintain
    low sensor costs, inexpensive materials, and low-cost manufacturing should be
    used. Vacuum processes, such as CVD, or high-temperature environments should be
    avoided because their operational expenses are high. Electrochemical-based procedures
    are less expensive than CVD techniques, but they necessitate complex equipment
    like a potentiostat and harmful chemicals. The use of solution-based manufacturing
    techniques is beneficial as it permits the production of a significant quantity
    of sensing material, which can be printed utilizing inkjet or aerosol printers.
    Although there is usually a compromise between the complexity of fabrication and
    the performance of sensors, numerous inexpensive sensors still show performance
    characteristics that are comparable to those of costly sensors. 4.4. Computational
    techniques (machine learning) The integration of machine learning models into
    electrochemical sensors offers great potential for enhancing their performance
    and improving overall efficiency. By incorporating machine-learning techniques,
    such as artificial neural networks, into the sensor design, several benefits can
    be achieved. One key advantage is the ability to minimize response times and drift
    [[261], [262], [263]] leading to more accurate and reliable measurements and optimize
    the manufacturing process [[264], [265], [266]]. This is crucial in applications
    where real-time monitoring or rapid detection is essential. To optimize the manufacturing
    process, machine-learning models can analyze and gather data related to fabrication
    parameters, performance parameters, and outputs. By training these models with
    the collected data, various aspects of the sensor''s design and performance can
    be optimized. For example, machine learning can assist in determining the optimal
    combination of fabrication parameters, leading to improved sensor sensitivity
    or selectivity. Additionally, machine-learning models can aid in identifying patterns
    and correlations in the collected data, enabling the discovery of new insights
    and guiding further advancements in sensor technology. However, one of the primary
    challenges in utilizing machine-learning models for electrochemical sensors is
    the significant time required for model training. As the number of parameters
    increases, the training time exponentially grows, making it a time-consuming process
    [264,267]. While reducing the number of parameters can help to minimize the number
    of data points required for training, this can be a tedious task [268]. Thus,
    it is essential to limit the parameters as much as possible to minimize costs
    associated with enhancing sensor performance and focus on evaluating the benefits
    of optimizing its performance. By focusing on evaluating the benefits of performance
    optimization, researchers and engineers can prioritize the most impactful parameters
    and allocate resources more efficiently, ensuring cost-effective improvements
    in sensor technology. 4.5. Electronic waste (E-waste) E-waste, also known as electronic
    waste, is a rapidly increasing waste category on a global scale, and it currently
    represents the fastest-growing waste stream in the United States. According to
    the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), only a small percentage, approximately
    15–20 %, of e-waste is recycled, with the majority ending up in landfills or incinerators.
    Properly managing e-waste poses two main concerns: the safe disposal of the waste
    and the lack of adequate regulations. Developing countries, such as China, India,
    and African nations, receive a significant portion of e-waste, raising concerns
    about environmental and health risks in those regions [269]. At present, e-waste
    disposal facilities often extract valuable, non-toxic metals for recycling but
    release toxic components, like Pb/Sn solder material and brominated flame retardant
    plastics, into the environment. This poses serious threats to both human and animal
    health, as well as the environment [270]. Given the vast amount of electronic
    waste generated, failure to address this issue promptly could lead to severe consequences.
    Consequently, efforts are underway to develop more efficient recycling techniques,
    particularly for recovering metallic components. E-waste is a complex mixture
    of metals, plastics, glasses, and other materials, making economical recovery
    a challenging task. Nonetheless, the significant value of precious metals, such
    as gold, silver, and palladium, plays a pivotal role in motivating recycling endeavors.
    Notably, printed circuit boards (PCBs) and discarded fragments from mobile phones
    are notably abundant in valuable metals, accompanied by a substantial quantity
    of fundamental metals. PCBs, essential constituents present in all electronic
    devices, including sensors, are constructed from a copper-clad laminate that encompasses
    glass fiber fortified with epoxy resin, plastics, and metals. The patterns on
    the substrate are imprinted or chemically etched using copper foil, and protective
    materials like gold, nickel, and tin are employed for safeguarding purposes. The
    overall composition of PCBs is approximated to consist of 40 % metals, 30 % organic
    materials, and 30 % refractory substances [271]. The organic constituents commonly
    encompass Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS), Polycarbonate (PC), Polyvinyl
    Chloride (PVC), Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), Polyethylene (PE), Polypropylene
    (PP), and High Impact Polystyrene (HIPS) [272]. The refractory substances comprise
    silica, titanates, alumina, and alkaline oxides. The potential toxicity of these
    materials, particularly plastics, raises significant apprehensions in the management
    of waste PCBs. Among the most hazardous elements are the soldering materials and
    plastics, particularly the brominated flame-retardants (BFRs) and the Pb/Sn solder.
    To achieve more effective recycling of waste PCBs, several steps and pathways
    can be taken. These include pre-treatment, separation of non-metallic fractions,
    and separation and recovery of metals. Pre-treatment involves disassembly to remove
    hazardous components, extracting solder, and performing mechanical procedures.
    This subsequently results in the application of physical separation methods [273].
    The next stage involves extracting the non-metallic components, specifically targeting
    polymers and fire-resistant plastics, which can be transformed into premium fuel
    products [274]. Finally, the central objective of recycling PCBs is to recover
    metals using various techniques, such as pyrometallurgy, hydrometallurgy, and
    biometallurgy [271]. 4.6. In-vivo measurement In-vivo measurements are crucial,
    for example, in studying the functions of the brain and mapping brain activity
    through the analysis of chemical signals in a living organism. The significance
    of pH in the pathophysiology of the brain is becoming increasingly important due
    to recent advancements in brain science, as evidenced by several studies [[275],
    [276], [277], [278]]. An optimal in vivo biosensor should possess properties such
    as being safe for the host, compatible with biological systems, capable of maintaining
    stability over extended periods, and able to detect changes in the system with
    precise timing and location. It would be advantageous for the biosensor to be
    capable of detecting multiple signals at once. In addition, it is crucial for
    the sensor to accurately measure the biological system without disrupting normal
    biological processes [279]. Accordingly, a pH sensor with demonstration on rabbit
    and human hearts was developed using IrOx [280]. The effectiveness of pH mapping
    was assessed using an in-vitro setup, where a group of 30 pH-sensing electrodes
    was utilized to monitor the movement of acid from a container to a surrounding
    solution of 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The container was constructed
    with a PDMS mold that had an “I\" shaped aperture, and it was filled with medical
    gauze soaked in a commercial pH 4 buffer solution. Spacers were positioned between
    the electrode array and the container, enabling the diffusion of acid and liquid
    electrolyte (i.e., PBS solution) across the sensing surfaces and the reference
    electrode. The observed distribution of acidic pH corresponded to the shape of
    the aperture, clearly demonstrating that the electrode array successfully tracked
    the changes in pH over time. 4.7. Inadequate presence of bodily fluids to ensure
    accurate pH assessments The pH level of sweat is connected to the pH value of
    the skin in the context of the wearable pH sensor. Nevertheless, detecting the
    pH of sweat has significant limitations when used for clinical diagnosis or monitoring
    physical activity. These limitations include insufficient production or absence
    of sweat, difficulties in collecting sweat, which can cause poor sweat flow to
    the sensing area, as well as issues related to the sweat rate. Sweating may differ
    from person to person, and factors such as their health, physical condition, and
    level of activity can influence the rate of sweating. To address the problem of
    persistent sweat flow to the sensing area of a flexible pH sensor chip attached
    to the body, a microfluidic device made of cellulose paper that operates through
    an evaporative pumping mechanism was developed. In this process, sweat is gathered
    from the device''s surface and moved via tiny channels using capillary forces.
    Eventually, it is guided towards the device''s outlet via a permeable structure
    utilizing evaporative pumping. This strategy guarantees a steady stream of sweat
    to the sensing area. Bandodkar et al. [281] presented a new type of wearable sweat
    sensor that uses a cellulose paper to absorb sweat and a fluidic channel to collect
    it for measuring the concentration of Na+ ions. This technology is cost-effective
    and easy to integrate into microfluidic devices and sensors, thanks to its low
    production cost and roll-to-roll manufacturing capability, which allows for high-volume
    production. Nie et al. [282] used sputter-deposited IrO2 and an Ag/AgCl RE to
    create a pH sensor. This sensor showed an exceptional response (61 mV/pH) in a
    pH range of 2–10. One research has shown that contact printing of nanowires on
    a Si chip (using biocompatible MOx such as ZnO) would be advantageous in developing
    precise, sensitive, and miniaturized sensors in large areas [283]. If someone
    is not sweating enough, there are medical techniques like iontophoresis that have
    been successfully used in a patch for monitoring sweat [284]. In order to enhance
    sweat absorption during exercise, the sweat sensor can be constructed on a cellulose
    cloth. This type of cloth is characterized by its high absorbency and capillary
    action, which aids in channeling the limited amount of sweat towards the sensing
    region for easier detection [285]. Insufficient contact between the sensitive
    electrode and the outermost layer of the skin can lead to imprecise readings of
    sweat pH, in addition to the absence of sweating. However, a solution to this
    issue involves the utilization of pH-sensors that are flexible and contain hydrogel
    [146]. To create a non-invasive connection between the sensor''s sensing interface
    and the skin, a hydrogel film was utilized. This film offered a direct path to
    the electronic components of the sensor. Moreover, the sensor utilized metalized
    electrospun fibers composed of palladium and palladium oxide, embedded in the
    hydrogel film. These fibers possess strong electrocatalytic and high sensitivity
    properties, enabling the sensor to achieve high sensitivity [146]. 4.8. Practical
    breath sampling challenges Using breath analysis for medical diagnostics can be
    highly effective, but detecting subtle variations in marker concentrations that
    distinguish between a healthy and diseased state can be challenging. This difficulty
    is exacerbated by the intricate composition of breath samples. Besides developing
    sensitive and selective sensors, careful consideration of sampling methods and
    necessary sample storage and transportation prior to analysis is crucial [286].
    It is important to note that while real breath samples are essential to test sensor
    performance; simulated breath samples are often used in early sensor development
    and testing due to better experimental control and availability to researchers
    [287]. In conjunction with discrepancies in health conditions and sampling techniques,
    additional elements like environmental aspects, dietary consumption, age, sex,
    and pregnancy can influence the constitution of a breath specimen. This complexity
    makes it challenging to establish a universal benchmark for comparison. To tackle
    this issue, endeavors should be directed towards minimizing personal dissimilarities
    to ensure their insignificance when contrasted with the typical distinctions witnessed
    between states of health and illness. The implementation of effective sampling
    protocols can contribute to the reduction of certain divergences. In earlier studies
    involving breath analysis, Pauling chose participants who had refrained from eating
    prior to the experiment, aiming to mitigate variations [288]. Nevertheless, this
    approach is not practical for most clinical breath analysis scenarios and compromises
    the non-invasive essence of such analysis. A recent instance of a breath analysis
    device that addresses variations stemming from the environment is the SpiroNose
    [251]. This apparatus employs both internal and external sensors to juxtapose
    the breath sample with a control sample of ambient air. One strategy to counteract
    foundational discrepancies arising from individual differences is to execute a
    control experiment on the same individual to establish their baseline. While this
    might not be feasible for the majority of breath analysis applications, it can
    be realized in cases involving H. pylori infections. In diagnosing such an infection,
    the patient''s baseline is determined by obtaining a breath sample. Subsequently,
    the patient ingests a urea tablet and then provides a second breath sample after
    a brief interval. By comparing the two samples, an H. pylori infection can be
    diagnosed, irrespective of variations in the environment and among individuals.
    5. Conclusions In summary, this review systematically explores metal oxide-based
    pH, temperature, and ammonia gas sensors, with a focus on integrating them into
    wireless health monitoring systems, particularly for wearables. The increasing
    demand for sensors in health applications, spanning chronic disease detection
    to industrial oversight, highlights their pivotal role in advancing healthcare
    and technology. The investigation examines ion-sensitive metal oxides, showcasing
    their diverse characteristics in micro-to nano-structured morphologies. The high
    surface-to-volume ratio of metal oxides promises enhanced response times, selectivity,
    and catalytic activity, positioning them as promising candidates for the next
    generation applications in online monitoring and wireless sensing. The review
    emphasizes the collective impact of pH, temperature, and ammonia gas sensors on
    health monitoring, highlighting their potential integration into affordable, flexible,
    and accurate wireless systems, especially wearables. Microfabrication methods
    are discussed as key enablers for creating high-functionality systems with precision
    in surface properties and reduced material usage. From a comparative analysis
    of sensor types, the review underscores the advantages of electrical and electrochemical
    sensors for health monitoring. Their affordability, rapid detection, ease of integration
    with microelectronics, small size, and compatibility with wearables make them
    ideal for wider adoption. Despite several reviews in the past decade, this paper
    fills a critical gap by providing a detailed examination of sensing mechanisms
    specific to each sensor type, including recent developments and fabrication methods.
    Addressing this knowledge gap contributes to a comprehensive understanding of
    the intricate interplay between ammonia, pH, and temperature sensors. In essence,
    this review not only illuminates the current state of these sensors but also charts
    a course for future advancements. The insights underscore the potential for developing
    cost-effective, adaptable, and precise wireless health monitoring systems, offering
    a roadmap for the continued evolution of wearable sensor technologies. These sensors
    emerge as indispensable tools, ushering in a new era of personalized and proactive
    healthcare solutions as we navigate the frontiers of health monitoring. Funding

    productivityGovernment policiesLake Urmia 1. Introduction Water scarcity and its
    improper use are related to increasing industrialization, urbanization, and demand
    for agricultural farms (Khan et al., 2009). Water crises occur in many countries
    with arid climates, while agriculture has a high share in water withdrawals (Peng
    et al., 2023). The water crisis has many consequences in most regions, especially
    in Iran. Iran is exposed to water shortage due to specific climatic and geographical
    features. The drought and destruction of wetlands and rivers indicate Iran’s unstable
    situation in terms of water resources. Lake Urmia (LU) is the largest internal
    in Iran, deteriorating due to climatic and human problems. The increase in the
    area under water cultivation, the decrease in rainfall, the low efficiency of
    agricultural irrigation, and the scarcity of allocation of sufficient water to
    meet the biological needs of the rivers are considered to be the most influential
    factors exacerbating the crisis of LU (Madani et al., 2014; Dehghanisanij et al.
    al., 2022). Weakness in water resources management caused by human factors has
    a Basic impact on the LU crisis (Azarnivand et al., 2015, Hamidi et al., 2021).
    For this purpose, properly exploiting the water resources in the LU basin is necessary.
    This requires the creation of a sustainable management schedule in the water resource
    considering the natural-social dimensions and the administrative structure at
    the local, provincial, and national levels (Jia et al., 2018, Dong et al., 2021).
    According to the existing limitations in the water resources of the LU basin,
    it is necessary to consider the relationships between users. Sometimes, the results
    are significantly affected by the relationships between the stakeholders, and
    as a result, the managers are not able to handle the basin properly (Blackstock
    and Richards, 2007, Blackstock et al., 2012). Stakeholders draw from shared surface
    and groundwater resources and are reciprocally affected by influencing the resources
    and other stakeholders. The remaining water resources affect stakeholder’s future
    decisions and ultimately have positive and negative effects on the system’s sustainability
    (Ohab-Yazdi and Ahmadi, 2018, Eyni et al., 2021). Considering the stakeholder’s
    interests, approaches, and interactions with each other can lead to the development
    of models with realistic results. Stakeholders’ decisions determine the implementation
    guarantee of policies decision-makers adopt (Elsawah et al., 2015, Voinov et al.,
    2016). The decisive role of stakeholders in the water resources systems management,
    the study of these systems reveals from a socio-ecological point of view, and
    they are considered among complex systems (Gain et al., 2021, Martinez-Fernandez
    et al., 2021). Farmers also seek to secure their economic benefits by attracting
    LGA subsidies and achieving sustainability in access to water resources. practical
    agents and the role of agents in the development technology in irrigation management
    (DTIM) of the LU basin were presented. The local government admins (LGA) goal
    is to adopt the best policies to improve irrigation efficiency and create synergy
    among independent farmers to preserve critical water resources in LU basin. In
    recent years, using agent-based models (ABM) for social-ecological systems, especially
    in agriculture and specifically in modeling the adaptability of farmers’ decisions,
    has expanded in different regions (Schulze et al., 2017, Lippe et al., 2019, Van
    Strien et al., 2019, Dai et al., 2020). Social-ecological systems are usually
    a couple of social decisions, including actors’ learning, coordination, and competition
    on the one hand and ecological complexities such as environmental effects on the
    other hand (Huber et al., 2021). This couple can form a complex adaptive system
    (CAS) due to the learning and adaptability of the actors. The adaptability of
    farmers in improving irrigation systems is one of the examples of complex systems
    that have been modeled in the form of complex systems in past studies (Aghaie
    et al., 2020, Hyun et al., 2019, Pouladi et al., 2020, Peng et al., 2023). Based
    on the social and environmental dimensions representing the symbols of the water
    resources systems stakeholders, the ABM makes it possible to realistically deal
    with water resources management issues and take steps toward sustainability (Latfi
    and Iraqinejad, 2016; Nouri et al., 2019). Considering the critical role of human
    impacts in water consumption decisions, understanding social impacts can provide
    a more profound perspective on water scarcity events (Berglund, 2012, AghaKouchak
    et al., 2021). Modeling social-ecological systems that include the complexity
    and random change of ecological and social components is usually very difficult.
    The bottom-up modeling approach in ABM is the best tool for assessing such systems.
    In this approach, the results emerge from random communication between heterogeneous,
    autonomous, and intelligent agents that can learn from their experiences and their
    neighbors in social communication and ecological changes in the model environment.
    Social-ecological systems form a complex, adaptable system in social and economic
    conditions. ABM is a suitable tool for analyzing the effects of policies and various
    social and ecological factors on these systems. Considering the bottom-up modeling
    of social developments, these systems are appropriate tools for evaluating regional
    social changes and social adaptability. In recent years, ABM models have been
    developed for water resources management (Berglund et al., 2015; Lin et al., 2020).
    Berger et al. (2007) concluded that ABMs are effective for better understanding
    the complexities between stakeholders and water consumption in a watershed. Akhbari
    and Grigg (2013) showed that in ABM, it is possible to examine management scenarios
    related to various social issues and reduce stakeholder differences by examining
    the interactions between multiple factors. Giuliani and Castelletti, (2013) concluded
    that ABM models are a powerful tool for increasing cooperation between upstream
    and downstream farmers of a watershed to improve economic conditions. Ghallehban
    Tekmedash et al. (2015) concluded that ABM models enable the simulation of social
    interactions, and combining ABM with water resources simulation models helps to
    produce and increase the reliability of comprehensive decision support models
    for water resources management. Castilla-Rho et al. (2015) concluded that using
    ABM models makes it possible to simulate farmers’ effects on groundwater tables.
    Du et al. (2017) investigated farmers’ performance in the water market using the
    ABM model. They introduced soil moisture and farmers’ interest in participating
    in auctions and learning as effective factors. Darbandsari et al. (2017) concluded
    that increasing the price of water and investing in advertising is a suitable
    strategy for urban drinking water management, which can be used to develop a framework
    for the social interactions of urban residents with each other using ABM. Cai
    and Xiong (2017) presented a model to investigate the effect of LGA support on
    the promotion and diffusion rate of user cooperation in irrigation systems in
    villages with water user associations operating in central China. The results
    show that LGA support plays an essential role in users'' participation. ABMs have
    the potential to significantly improve the design of solid regulations and incentives
    for managing water resources (Castilla-Rho et al., 2015, Xiao et al., 2018, Guo
    et al., 2022). Nhim et al. (2018) concluded that ABM models are a powerful tool
    in investigating how socio-economic and environmental changes affect how humans
    use water resources. Poladi et al. (2020) reported that farmers’ performance and
    willingness to participate in the restoration of LU could be simulated by integrating
    ABM into the socio-hydrological framework. Ohab-Yazdi and Ahmadi (2018) showed
    that the appropriate interactions of the regional water organization with other
    stakeholders lead to the control of illegal water withdrawals and increased water
    levels in aquifers. Pooralihossein et al. (2020) concluded that ABM has a good
    performance in simulating the state of the basin, changes in surface water, cropping
    patterns, and groundwater source extraction. Anbari et al. (2021) concluded that
    LGA-funded programs can compensate about 23% of the negative balance of the aquifer
    within 13 years. Lang and Ertsen (2022) investigated the interaction between human
    and non-human agents in an irrigation system. The results showed that the irrigation-related
    agent-based model (IRABM) provides a novel perspective in modeling the human-water
    system. Okura et al. (2022) investigated irrigation management using the ABM model
    and Game theory. The results showed that social changes can accelerate the non-cooperative
    behavior of farmers. Shoushtarian et al. (2022) developed an ABM model to simulate
    agricultural water use and socio-hydrological dynamics in California. The results
    showed that ABM helps to evaluate the current water reuse management practices
    on the sustainability of water resources. Harik et al. (2023) developed a spatiotemporal
    ABM framework to investigate farmers’ probabilistic decisions. The results show
    the salience of the socio-economic characteristics of farmers in evaluating future
    decisions. Streefkerk et al. (2023) presented a dynamic drought adaptive modeling
    framework combining socio-hydrological modeling and ABM approaches in Kenya. The
    results showed that absorption of adaptation to drought affects soil moisture,
    groundwater, and drought propagation. Mirzaei et al. (2023) concluded that for
    the water-energy-food nexus model implementation in the water-scarce region, the
    policies of using advanced irrigation technologies under the LGA’s facilities
    (subsidies or low interest loans) scenarios are necessary. A review of the research
    shows that ABM models are an efficient tool for water resources management. However,
    one of the fundamental challenges is designing the performance of human agents.
    For actual simulation, it is necessary to include the relationship of agents with
    each other and the environment authentically in the modeling. For this purpose,
    in this study, a model based on the simulation of social interactions, effective
    agents, and the agent’s role in developing irrigation systems in the LU basin
    is investigated. LU is one of the largest saline lakes in the world, which is
    being destroyed catastrophically due to human activities, especially agriculture.
    Therefore, the focus is on LU and the water resources stakeholders in this basin.
    In previous studies, the effect of LGA agents and their relationship to changing
    the behavior of water resource stakeholders has been investigated in a limited.
    In this study, the impact of LGA agents is evaluated by presenting an actual sample.
    It seems that the implementation of LGA policy will improve the situation of water
    resource exploitation. Still, the desired result has not been achieved due to
    the scarcity of effective coordination between the LGA and the behavioral models
    of the stakeholders. Therefore, it is tried to examine the effect of implementing
    the proposed policies and provide solutions to improve applied water productivity
    (WP) by modeling the behaviors of LGA and agricultural stakeholders. The contributions
    of the article are as follows: • Determining the practical factors and their relationship
    in DTIM of LU using the ABM model. • Determining desirable and progressive policies
    and restrictions in DTIM of LU basin. • Developing the ABM model under different
    scenarios and providing the most adaptable policies to achieve higher WP and more
    profitable management of water resources in the LU basin. The other sections of
    the article are organized as follows: Section 2 illustrates the studied area,
    the proposed approach, and the influential agents. Section 3 describes the results
    and discussion. Section 4 provides a summary explanation of the article and suggestions
    for future studies. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Lake Urmia basin LU basin, located
    in the northwest of Iran, with an area of 51,876 Km2, is one of the main basins
    of Iran. LU is the largest inland Lake of Iran and one of the most valuable water
    ecosystems in Iran and the world (Danesh-Yazdi and Ataie-Ashtiani, 2019). The
    downward trend of ’s water level started in 1995, and for 20 years, the level
    of the lake has dropped more than 8 m. As a result, the balance of more than 30
    BCM of the water volume of LU has been lost due to evaporation and lack of annual
    rainfall. Due to the location of LU in a closed basin, rainfall and runoff are
    considered sources of water input to the lake, and evaporation is an output. Two
    main factors of LU drying up are (1) Unbalanced development and excessive extraction
    of renewable water resources in LU basin (human factors) (2) Climatic changes
    and fluctuations and the continuation of drought (natural factors). Investigations
    indicate that natural factors (18% decrease in rainfall and 1.5°C increase in
    temperature) and human factors are involved in the drought crisis of LU by 31%
    and 69%, respectively (Habibi et al., 2021). Fig. 1 shows the condition of LU

    full-size image Fig. 1. Previous and existing conditions of LU (Wurtsbaugh and
    Sima, 2022). Under human factors, the development of the cultivated area and the
    increase of water consumption in the LU basin have been done mainly to improve
    living conditions and increasefarmers’ income. The increase in the cultivated
    area and water consumption has caused a crisis in LU, and the living conditions
    of the residents of LU have become more unfavorable. 2.2. Miandoab plain Miandoab
    Plain is located in the southern part of Lake Urmia. Miandoab’s geographic coordinates
    are 45°43’N, 36°46’E, and its altitude is 1292 m above sea level (Dehghanisanij
    et al., 2023). The average annual rainfall is 296 mm, and the average humidity
    is 53%. The average yearly and minimum temperatures are 11.8 °C and −3 °C, respectively.
    In Fig. 2, the geographical location of Miandoab Plain is shown on the map. Miandoab
    Plain has half of the surface flows entering LU and 20% of the total groundwater
    pumping. Zarineh Roud and Simineh Roud are the primary sources of surface waters
    of Miandoab Plain, which are discharged into LU (Rahimi and Breuste, 2021). Zarineh
    Roud and Simineh Roud basins include the largest sub-basin of the LU basin (34%
    of the total LU basin area). In recent years, the function of securing the rights
    of LU has been lost due to the development of exploitation of the surface water
    resources of these rivers. Download : Download high-res image (312KB) Download

    are widely used to simulate the collective outcomes of aggregate individual behavior
    in complex systems (Helbing, 2012). This modeling method is usually connected
    to the emergence of individual behavior of autonomous and independent agents and
    the interaction between them in a complex system. Complex systems are defined
    as systems whose behavior is intrinsically challenging to model due to the dependencies,
    competitions, relationships, or other interactions between their parts or between
    a given system and its environment (Newman et al., 2019). ABM shifts the focus
    from variables to agents. These models allow for differences and interactions
    between individual factors. At the same time, the output emerges from the result
    of the overall behavior, considering their compatibility and interaction with
    other factors and the environment, and is not dependent on the individual behavior
    of the factors (Schinckus, 2019, Silverman et al., 2021). When agents desire to
    benefit from intelligent logic and procedure and learning in their decisions,
    they can adapt to environmental changes, and complex adaptive systems (CAS) are
    formed. ABM approach can model the variability and uncertainty in complex adaptive
    systems and their adaptation to modifications (Haghnevis et al., 2016, Wilson
    et al., 2023). Also, this approach can model social processes well by considering
    the bounded rationality of agents. In adaptive systems, ABM is usually mixed with
    the conflict of interests of the agents. Each agent individually evaluates their
    interest and could make the necessary decisions based on behavioral and logical
    mechanisms such as coordination or competition to achieve their expected benefits
    (Heydari et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2021). Fig. 3 shows the ABM model and its
    components. According to Fig. 3, agents form a complex adaptive system according
    to the interaction with other agents and the environment and decision-making approaches
    that can be equation-based, rule-based, and a combination of these two. Also,
    each agent has its perceptions, behavioral specifications, and interaction with
    other agents and the environment, and the results emerge from a whole complex
    system. Download : Download high-res image (149KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 3. ABM model architecture (Zhang et al. 2021). According to the explanations,
    complex adaptive systems are suitable for simulating social-environmental systems.
    For this purpose, it is expected to use ABM. On the one hand, agent-based models
    can model uncertainty, complexity, and diversity in environmental systems. On
    the other hand, these models can simulate agents’ decision-making and social patterns
    by considering a combination of agents’ autonomy, independence, intelligence,
    and limited rationality. In this study, the adaptation of smallholder farmers
    in DTIM is modeled to increase WP as a socio-biological system using the ABM model.
    2.4. Designed ABM model The ABM model is designed to model the adaptability of
    farmers in DTIM. This model includes two groups of farmers and LGA agents. Farmers
    with different levels, with low WP of DTIM, are looking for economic benefits
    and reduced irrigation and production costs. Meanwhile, the LGA is looking for
    strategic goals to maintain water resources'' sustainability. The LGA employs
    incentives (subsidies in this study) to encourage farmers to DTIM. In addition,
    it is used as a tool for supervision and training farmers'' performance. Farmers
    are currently harvesting water resources with irrigation systems and different
    levels of technology, and they intend to provide short-term benefits. Farmers
    adjust the existing approach based on their knowledge of the importance of DTIM
    and propensity to increase WP and cost-benefit evaluation. DTIM has an initial
    implementation fee. Every farmer can increase WP by using LGA subsidies. If none
    of the farmers create optimal use of water resources, access to water resources
    will be threatened in the long term. This is considered a hypothetical cost for
    farmers who do not participate in DTIM. With DTIM, considering that LGA facilities
    cover an essential part of implementation costs, farmers may think of profiting
    from LGA facilities by selling that equipment, especially if the farmers in the
    following conditions may consider selling their developed irrigation equipment.
    In this case, the technology of their irrigation system will return to the state
    before development. – When the threshold of farmers’ propensity to DTIM is low
    (for example, in the conditions of scarcity of access to sufficient training about
    the new irrigation system or its role in reducing the cost and sustainability
    of water resources) – When the share of LGA subsidy is high, and as a result,
    the profit from the sale of equipment is attractive, especially in conditions
    of inflation. – Finally, farmers’ honesty threshold should be reduced based on
    the positive experience of profit-seeking and deception among neighbors. Increasing
    the share of LGA subsidies can encourage farmers to earn profits. Therefore, the
    LGA can help increasefarmers’ profits by considering the assessment teams at different
    levels with DTIM training. LGA evaluations monitor the behavior of farmers. If
    farmers sell their improved irrigation system for profit, they may be deprived
    of some LGA services and the possibility of receiving subsidies again. Assessments
    The LGA can increase farmers'' honesty. Next, the ABM model evaluates LGA policies
    to achieve a suitable framework for water resources management in the Miandoab
    region. NetLogo is software for simulating different phenomena with a satisfactory
    interface. This feature will be beneficial for modeling farmers’ decisions in
    this study. In addition, one of the advantages of NetLogo software is that it
    is written in Java (Tisue and Wilensky, 2004, Chiacchio et al., 2014). To further
    adapt the model presented in this study to the social-ecological environment,
    questionnaires and specialized interviews were used to identify stakeholders,
    their characteristics, and interactions and define scenarios. Various interviews
    were conducted with practical stakeholders in Miandoab Plain, including managers
    and experts of regional water institutions, the Ministry of Agriculture, and farmers.
    The research team evaluated the most important factors affecting farmers’ decisions
    through surveys and interviews with local farmers (including 42 local farmers
    studied). Also, the estimation of costs, WP and its effect in reducing costs and
    increasing crop yield was performed with the help of the expert team after evaluating
    the interviews and surveys of farmers. According to the study, farmers wanted
    increased LGA support (low-interest loans) for developing agricultural irrigation
    technology and increased joint cooperation through regional associations. Also,
    their most important concern is the crisis of access to sustainable water supply
    (SWS) and water salinization in the region and reducing the effects of the drying
    up of Lake Urmia. The collected interviews were reviewed by the researcher’s self-review
    method and member control, and the validity of the interview findings corresponded
    (Andreas, 2003). Convergent interviews were used to ensure the reliability of
    the interviews. Fig. 4 shows the data collection process of the proposed ABM model.
    According to Fig. 4, the main stages of modeling include adequate information
    and data collection, modeling, and policy analysis. For this purpose, firstly,
    model features and input factors (various environmental and social aspects) affecting
    adaptation to DTIM were organized for this purpose. Then, the ABM model is formed
    by understanding all environmental and social components. Finally, with the help
    of statistical analysis, the policies and components affecting the results are
    evaluated. Download : Download high-res image (502KB) Download : Download full-size

    presented ABM model, changing the characteristics and behaviors of a group of
    farmers and the LGA decision-making effect are modeled as the foremost and influential
    agents in exploiting and using technology in optimizing irrigation management
    in the LU basin. ABM provides a clearer picture of the complex adaptive system
    of each farmer’s decisions in interaction with other farmers and the environment
    in response to LGA policies. The LGA (as a representative of the water and agricultural
    department) allocates subsidies to the farmer agent to increase WP by DTIM. Fig.

    adaptability agent-based model in the DTIM. The proposed framework collects inputs
    such as farmers’ profile information such as age, size of agricultural land, level
    of academic education, job preference, and coordinates and distances. Based on
    this information, the entrepreneurship index that shows the potential of each
    farmer to develop the irrigation system is calculated. The amount of farmers’
    costs and profits and DTIM costs have been estimated as inputs to the model. Farmers
    are scattered around the modeling world. Each farmer has social connections with
    neighbors who can share their experiences. In the model environment, the policies
    of the LGA agents such as supervision and training and LGA subsidies to improve
    their irrigation system, as well as the uncertainty caused by weather changes
    or decision-making patterns, affect them. Different scenarios have been considered
    for each of these influential factors, such as LGA subsidy or the level of LGA
    supervision and training and the level of uncertainty affecting the decisions
    of the agents. Farmer agents can make decisions by evaluating the costs and benefits
    of their decisions, considering experiences and the costs of SWS. Farmers usually
    use the triggers of the desire to DTIM and the honesty in using LGA subsidies
    to make decisions. The amount of these stimuli affects farmers’ decisions and
    vice versa. Finally, by running the ABM model in sufficient repetitions under
    different scenarios, statistical analysis is performed on the emerging results
    of the model. These results, which are considered in line with the critical objectives
    of this study, include the mean ratio of DTIM, the mean speed of DTIM, field application
    efficiency (FAE), and mean LGA expenditure (subsidy count). To explain the framework
    of the proposed model more precisely, the practical components and the decision-making
    model of the agents, both farmers and the LGA, are described in more detail. 2.5.1.
    Farmer agent Farmer agents are scattered in the model according to their geographic
    coordinates and usually use water wells to irrigate farms. Farmers use water wells
    dug in or around their farms to irrigate their crops. The objective of the farmer
    agent is to increase the profit or maintain the existing yield in the conditions
    of upgrading the irrigation system (Janssen & van Ittersum, 2007; Holtz & Pahl-Wostl,
    2012). The characteristics of farmer agents include age, occupation, education,
    available capital, amount of available water, cultivation pattern, farm scale,
    and irrigation method. Each of the agents is assigned an entrepreneurship indicator
    (entrepre), which shows the potential for creativity in the DTIM. This index is
    a normalized sum of three components: education level, age, and occupational concentration
    (the second occupation related to agriculture). Table 1 shows the different levels
    of effectiveness of the mentioned components in calculating the innovation index.
    Table 1. The effectiveness of the components in calculating the entrepre index.
    Age (year) Education Occupation Entrepre index age<40 40<age<60 age>60 University
    education or without education Without side occupation or unrelated occupation
    Normalized entrepre index [1–3] [1–5] [1–3] [0,1] The minimum and maximum value
    of the entrepre index is between 0 and 1, and a higher value indicates the tremendous
    potential of the farmer to DTIM. Farmers’ agents in the initial state have a different
    irrigation system technology level. The status of the DTIM level in the proposed
    model is considered from 1 (basin irrigation with low irrigation efficiency) to
    6 (subsurface irrigation with higher irrigation efficiency) (Table 2). It is assumed
    that the existing costs of farmers’ agents and WP will decrease and increase,
    respectively, with the increase of the entrepre index. Therefore, the DTIM is
    desirable for farmers and has economic appeal. Table 2. The status of the irrigation
    system in the study area. Irrigation method irrstatus value Basin 1 Furrow 2 Sprinkler
    3 Surface drip (tape) 4 Surface drip (tape) (with irrigation management) 5 Subsurface
    drip irrigation 6 According to the questionnaires and interviews, criteria were
    considered for each characteristic in the ABM model. The developed ABM model emphasizes
    the effect of economic profit on farmer’s decision-making process while considering
    other influencing factors. For each farmer, based on the current state of the
    irrigation system level and other influential factors, there is a subsidy for
    DTIM. The subsidy effectively increases the farmer’s motivation and propensity
    to DTIM and improves WP. On the other hand, the farmer may be encouraged to seek
    profit by selling upgraded irrigation systems and pieces of equipment for more
    liquidity and profit. The decisions of the farmer’s agent are formed based on
    the approach of learning and neighboring farmers. 2.5.2. Farmer’s agent decision
    The farmer agent in a complex adaptive system has rational limitations. These
    agents aim to learn from their own and neighbors’ experiences to improve perception
    in interaction with other agents and the environment and provide benefits. Farmers
    intellectually use some subjective indicators or mental triggers based on past
    experiences to make decisions in the real world. For this purpose, farmer agents
    use trigger values that lead to changing their existing approach and making new
    decisions. Triggers represent the subjective views of the farmer. It is assumed
    that farmers who do not have the proper level of WP can make decisions for DTIM.
    One of the considered triggers is the propensity of farmers to DTIM (prop). Reducing
    the value of the prop trigger may change the ’s behavior, including the decision
    to use or not use DTIM, the jobbery trigger, and thefarmer’s participation trigger
    in investment. The prop trigger value is formed based on the simultaneous influence
    of the characteristics and experiences of the farmer’s agent in previous decisions.
    At first, it is assumed that the farmer’s agents, including the farm scale (scale)
    and entrepreneurship (entrepre), determine the propensity of farmers to DTIM.
    The minimum value of the prop trigger (prop.min) is defined as follows: (1) where
    α and β express the effect of farm scale and the farmer’s entrepreneurship on
    the initial propensity to DTIM, respectively. The value of the propensity changes
    during the iteration of the model based on the interaction and experiences of
    the agent with its neighbors. It is assumed that the trigger of the farmers’ propensity
    to DTIM in periods t+1 and t is equal to ( ) and ( ), respectively. The amount
    of this trigger is calculated based on the positive and negative experiences of
    the farmer agent as follows (Eqs. 2 and 3): In positive experience conditions,
    (2) In negative experience conditions, (3) where e+ and e- indicate the positive
    and negative impact on the trigger of the farmers’ propensity DTIM, respectively
    (the effect of negative experience is more significant than positive experience).
    This trigger is between 0 and 1 and depends on the minimum initial trigger value
    (prop.min) and the existing experience. Negative experience shows that the costs
    of DTIM outweigh its benefits. In this study, it is assumed that the challenge
    of SWS in the long term is such that if farmers do not take action to correct
    the existing process of using water resources, this possibility is seriously threatened.
    Considering this issue, the non-participation of farmers in upgrading the irrigation
    system is regarded as a cost. This cost will decrease with the participation of
    more farmers in improving irrigation productivity (SWR). The value of the SWR
    index is equal to the result of dividing the total yield of the number of farmers
    at different levels of irrigation technology (corresponding to irrigation efficiency)
    divided by the number of farmers at the ideal level of irrigation efficiency.
    The SWR value is calculated as follows: (4) Next, DTIM costs are calculated by
    the farmer agent (cost) as follows: (5) where intcost indicates the initial cost
    of implementing DTIM, and scale is farm size, ρ is considered a random value between
    0 and 1, which indicates random changes such as seasonal and climate periodic
    changes or the random effects of social decision-making patterns that govern the
    environment of the complex system and affect the farmer’s behavior. r shows the
    impact of the random factor in decisions, and its increase means an increase in
    random change in the range of 0 and 1. par represents the participation of the
    farmer agents. par shows the amount of flexibility in the cost the farmer is willing
    to apply to upgrade the irrigation system. This value is initially considered
    equal to 1 and depends on the farmer’s propensity to upgrade the irrigation system.
    This value changes in each iteration of the model runs. In other words, this coefficient
    moderates system implementation''s profit (spend) and loss (fee). Interests of
    the farmer agent are calculated according to the costs of production (impcost)
    and its reduction ratio (CostR) due to the reduction of water consumption and
    the profit of increasing the crop yield (dyield). In addition, LGA training positively
    affects the farmer agent’s profit by improving irrigation efficiency. The effect
    of increasing profits and LGA training on the farmer agent (Ed) is calculated
    as follows. (6) Ed value was considered 15%. The profit (spend) of the farmer
    agent is calculated as follows: (7) By comparing profit (spend) and cost (fee)
    values, the farmer agent decides to develop the irrigation system technology.
    If fee > spend, a negative experience is formed from the desirability of DTIM
    (Eq. 8). If spend > fee, a positive experience (expos) is recorded to influence
    the propensity threshold (prop) of the farmer agent (Eq. 9). (8) (9) According
    to Eqs. 2 and 3 and the experience of the farmer’s representative, the prop value
    is determined. Suppose the farmer is eager to DTIM (the value of the prop trigger
    is high), by increasing the participation rate. In that case, the farmer’s share
    of covering its costs will increase. For this purpose, it is assumed that the
    benefits of irrigation system development are more than the costs, and the amount
    of farmer participation will decrease. Conversely, the higher the DTIM costs,
    the greater the farmer’s participation due to the intrinsic utility of increasing
    WP. Table 3 shows the effect of comparing profit and cost on farmer participation.
    Table 3. The effect of spend and fee on the participation of Farmer agent. Changes
    of par or jobbery values High value of trigger prop ( ) Very high value of trigger
    prop ( ) 2.5.3. Decision to sell improved irrigation equipment (jobbery of farmers’
    agent) Increasing LGA incentives can encourage farmers to upgrade DTIM. On the
    other hand, it can encourage farmers to profit by selling irrigation equipment.
    To model the adaptation in the complex system with these conditions, it is assumed
    that the farmer agent at the highest level of WP can prefer the temporary benefits
    to the DTIM benefits by selling the equipment. Since farmers have abused LGA facilities
    and supervision can lead to their exclusion from various facilities to improve
    the WP. For this purpose, the costs and benefits of the farmer’s agent are determined
    and compared. It is assumed that farmers decide to sell installed irrigation equipment.
    In this case, considering the effect of random changes (r), the ρ (impact of random
    changes), and the amount of LGA subsidies, the amount of spend is calculated in
    the model considering the jobbery coefficient (job). This coefficient acts as
    a reverse of the participation component (par). Farmer agents have both components.
    The amount of this component depends on the difference between the benefits and
    costs of the farmer in the situation where he has the potential to sell irrigation
    equipment. In general, the benefits of farmers in case of decision to sell the
    installed irrigation equipment are calculated as follows: (10) The fee for the
    farmer who decides to sell irrigation equipment is equal to the sum of the scale
    in the amount of increase in the costs of production (impcost), its reduction
    ratio (CostR) plus the costs of the loss of SWS. This cost is similar to the previous
    ones by considering the effect of r and ρ in fee estimation. It is assumed that
    the farmer has received training in the previous period. The positive effect of
    LGA training affects the farmer''s fees. Otherwise, training does not play a role
    in the farmer’s agent fees. (11) (12) Next, the farmer’s agent has to sell irrigation
    equipment against a negative cost. If the cost is more than the benefits (fee
    > spend), a positive experience of the desirability of upgrading the irrigation
    system is formed. In the opposite of this situation (spend > fee), a negative
    experience is recorded to influence the propensity threshold of a farmer. In addition,
    it may lead to the farmer agent deciding to sell the irrigation equipment and
    earn profit from the LGA subsidy on existing equipment. Similar to the decision
    of farmers to upgrade the irrigation system, farmers can learn from neighboring
    farmers and share their experiences. Therefore, the farmer’s experience is transferred
    to the neighboring farmers and influences their decisions unless each neighbor
    has a different experience. Suppose the farmer''s farmer’s profit is higher. In
    that case, the irrigation system equipment is sold depending on the cheat chance
    component value (cheatchance) and r ((13), (14)). (13) (14) The cheatchance of
    each farmer depends on the amount of subsidy and honesty. (15) Similar to the
    propensity trigger value, the farmer’s honesty value depends on existing honesty
    values and positive and negative experiences. The positive experience in the honesty
    of each agent is the direct and indirect experience of LGA supervision and training
    of the farmer and his neighbors. If the farmer agent and the neighbors (defined
    in the neighborhood network) do not have supervision experience in each period
    of running the model, negative experiences and otherwise positive experiences
    will be formed to update the honesty. Therefore, the honesty component of the
    farmer’s agents (honesty) is updated as follows: (16) (17) where the values of
    i+ and i- parameters in the range (0,1) have a positive and negative effect on
    honesty, respectively. The impact of negative experience is greater than positive
    experience. Similar to the prop, the value of the honesty is calculated based
    on the impact of positive and negative experiences and the minimum value of honesty
    (honesty.min). The honesty.min value is considered to be a positive number close
    to zero (equal to 0.003). Finally, the number of jobbery cases is updated in each
    period, as shown in Table 4. Table 4. The effect of spend and fee on the jobbery
    of farmer agent. Changes of par or jobbery values High value of trigger prop (
    ) Very high value of trigger prop ( ) If the farmer is not propensity to DTIM
    (low prop trigger value), the share of profit from the sale of irrigation equipment
    may increase by increasing the amount of jobbery. For this purpose, it is assumed
    that the profit from the sale of the irrigation system is higher than the costs,
    which increases the job component of the farmer. On the contrary, if the costs
    increase, the farmer adjusts the job component. 2.6. Local government admins’
    (LGA) agent Improving WP is the primary objective of the LGA agent. In this study,
    LGA and farmers seek to increase WP and sustainable access to SWR and prevent
    the salinization of water resources in the region. To achieve this goal, the LGA
    can grant its facilities to farmers to cover part of the costs of implementing
    DTIM while creating coordination and synergy among farmers. According to their
    economic interests, farmers are looking for the implementation of DTIM, because
    it leads to a reduction in the costs of crop cultivation and an increase in irrigation
    efficiency and crop yield. Farmers may take advantage of these facilities by preferring
    their short-term economic benefits by selling DTIM equipment as a jobbery. Due
    to the effect of social communication, farmers can share experiences and learn
    in the model. Farmers'' decisions about upgrading the DTIM or abusing LGA facilities
    can be simulated in the form of mental triggers including the propensity to upgrade
    the irrigation system and honesty in not abusing LGA facilities. In this situation,
    the LGA can influence the experiences, learning, and decisions of farmers by using
    policies such as the level of facilities supervision, and training to coordinate
    farmers in realizing the goal of increasing WP and maintaining the SWR and adapt
    them to DTIM. At the same time, the LGA is looking to reduce the number of facilities
    and evaluate the effectiveness of these policies (by assessing the speed of adaptation
    DTIM among farmers). With these assumptions, the LGA agent is trying to encourage
    and adapt the farmer agents to DTIM. It is assumed that the number of farmers,
    the amount of cultivated area and the expected crop yield remain the same throughout
    the modeling. The LGA has considered incentive policies, which are the primary
    guardians of the WP in the agricultural sector. Granting facilities for DTIM is
    one of the policies considered in this field. The LGA seeks to encourage farmers
    to increase WP by giving facilities. In addition, by considering supervision and
    training teams, the LGA can minimize the problems of DTIM and help increase WP
    and crop yield. Supervision prevents from the misuse of the facilities granted
    by the LGA as establishes honesty among the farmers. In the following, the most
    important components and indicators of LGA agents, as well as the details of different
    scenarios in the policies applied by the LGA, are introduced. As most important
    goal of the present study is to increase WP in the study area. Therefore, the
    FAE index is used to evaluate irrigation efficiency as follows: (18) where is
    the amount of expected WP in different irrigation systems, which is estimated
    as follows (Table 5) (Amosson et al., 2002). Table 5. Expected WP in different
    irrigation systems. Irrigation system Irrstatus amount Border 30% 1 Furrow 50%
    2 Sprinkler 65% 3 Surface drip (tape) 80% 4 Surface drip (tape) (with irrigation
    management) 90% 5 Subsurface drip irrigation 95% 6 One of the most essential components
    of the LGA’s success in increasing the value of the FAE index is summarized. Therefore,
    the LGA’s best policies can improve this index or increase the speed of its advancement
    in the studied complex socio-environmental system. In the ABM model, the effects
    of these incentive policies are evaluated in the form of different scenarios.
    For this purpose, the impact of LGA policies on the results is evaluated. 2.7.
    Model implementation The developed ABM model is implemented in the time step of
    half crop season for 100 years. 42 farmer agents were considered in the model.
    The considered irrigation methods include two general methods of traditional and
    advanced irrigation (including drip and sprinkler irrigation). Considering the
    importance of the economic factor in the farmer’s agent decision-making, the sub-model
    for calculating the farmers’ economic spending was considered. The cost of implementing
    irrigation systems, crop yields, and price of crop planting and harvesting (including
    fertilizers, seeds, manual workers, water pumping costs, etc.) were calculated.
    2.7.1. Definition of the policies of the LGA in DTIM 2.7.1.1. LGA subsidies In
    recent years, the LGA has tried encouraging farmers to use technology for DTIM
    by considering incentives. LGAs aim to encourage farmers to participate in improving
    the irrigation system by providing facilities such as loans, subsidies, and grants.
    However, the LGA’s financial resources are limited. On the other hand, this facility
    should be the right amount to encourage the farmers to participate and invest
    in improving the WP. In some cases, it can be seen that the high share of LGA
    subsidy can make farmers seek profit and sell irrigation equipment later. Therefore,
    the LGA’s policy is fundamental in choosing the appropriate level of subsidies.
    In this situation, four different scenarios are considered to evaluate the LGA’s
    subsidy policies in the investigated problem, and by analyzing its consequences,
    the model results are checked. For the predicted scenarios, the existing policies
    are based on the subsidy paid to the farmers depending on the type of their irrigation
    system. The four mentioned scenarios are considered with the initial assumption
    of the existing scenario. In Table 6, four different scenarios are presented for
    evaluating LGA subsidies. Table 6. Different scenarios for government subsidy
    evaluatio. Scenario specifications Scenario name Scenario Increase the subsidy
    level by 30% Enlarge Subsidy increase Reducing the subsidy level by 30% Diminish
    Subsidy reduction No change in the subsidy level Normal Unchanged The random change
    of each scenario Mix of all Random 2.7.1.2. Supervision and training policy In
    addition to LGA subsidies, supervision and training aimed at achieving the DTIM
    has been considered for the farmer. The farmer feels the need for training. However,
    the effectiveness of training and evaluating the effects of LGA subsidies on farmers''
    behavior and adaptability in the DTIM is essential. As mentioned, some farmers
    may sell irrigation equipment to increase their short-term benefits due to the
    subsidy paid. In this situation, it is assumed that in each implementation of
    the model, depending on the scenarios considered by the LGA, farmers are randomly
    selected and supervised while benefiting from training. Based on Eq. 6, the positive
    effect of increasing farmers’ profits through random numerical training is about
    15%. Each farmer’s agents in the model receives supervision and training. In the
    case of jobbery, the farmer agent is deprived of training, and all the farmer
    agents in the neighborhood network and the farmers in their radius R will have
    a positive experience of honesty (due to the fear of losing LGA support and other
    social consequences, farmers are not encouraged to make a profit and sell the
    equipment). The LGA has the power to choose the supervision and training teams.
    By analyzing the model results, it is possible to evaluate the effectiveness of
    scenarios of increasing and decreasing the supervision and training teams. The
    parameters of the ABM model are calibrated using the investigated data and field
    studies and are presented in Table 7. Table 7. Range of ABM model parameters.

    implement the proposed model, the combination of the proposed scenarios (including
    64800 states) in the model with 100 time periods has been executed 100 times each
    time. Each of these scenarios was analyzed by balanced variance analysis. On an
    8-core computer with 16 GB of RAM, the activity assumed 60 min to run and complete.
    The total number of participants and the cost of the present study are 10 (3 direct
    and 7 indirect) and 2000,000 IRR ($400), respectively. Balanced variance analysis
    was used to investigate the factors affecting farmers’ adaptation to DTIM. The
    outcomes were statistically analyzed with balanced variance analysis (ANOVA),
    including the average threshold of propensity (mean.prop) and honesty (mean.honesty)
    of farmers to supervise the influencing factors on farmers’ decisions and the
    average indicators of WP (SWR, FAE) and evaluation the amount of mean LGA expenditure

    = 23.37%. Accordingly, the most effective indicators of the farmer agent’s propensity
    (mean.prop) to develop technology in irrigation systems are uncertainty (random
    change of the system caused by climatic, farm conditions, and behavior patterns
    and social changes), SWS, and LGA supervision and training with a p-value=0.0
    at the confidence level of 95% (Fig. 6). SWS, LGA supervision and training are
    the most influential indicators of the farmer agent’s propensity to DTIM with
    F-value=4375.59 and F-value=1055.10, respectively. The seed-ratio and seed-owner
    indices are the lowest influence on the farmer agent’s propensity to DTIM. The
    effect of the initial population on the mean.prop index is negligible. Download

    The effect of input indicators on the propensity and participation of the farmer
    agent to DTIM. Therefore, the agents’ subjective propensity in the DTIM is affected
    by various inputs. The participation of the farmer agent in water resources management
    leads to the possibility of optimal local management (Warner, 2006, Liu et al.,
    2018). Community development leads to finding solutions to organize self-cooperation
    programs that lead to SWS (Horbach, 2012). Sustainable development continues with
    the optimal use of water resources (Salarpour et al., 2022). Awareness and participation
    encourage the desire to DTIM. Reducing costs and providing LGA subsidies are influential
    factors for farmers’ adoption and DTIM (Chuchird et al., 2017, Zhang et al., 2019).
    The results of the present study are consistent with the findings of Shresta and
    Gopalakristhnan (2015). The seed-ratio, network-density, uncertainty, SWS, and
    LGA supervision and training indicators are the most influential parameters on
    the mean.honesty index with p-value= 0.0 at the 95% confidence level. The LGA
    supervision and training index with F-value=1400027.11 significantly affects the
    honesty of the farmer agent. LGA supervision and training are fundamental in the
    farmer agent benefitting from LGA subsidies (Fig. 7). One of the active policies
    of the LGA is the allocation of subsidies for the DTIM (Kahil et al., 2015, Jordan
    et al., 2023). In addition, the LGA agent minimizes DTIM problems by considering
    supervision and training teams (Palanisami et al., 2011). Supervision teams minimize
    subsidy abuse and create a sense of honesty in the farmer agent. According to
    the value of R-Sq= 97.76, the analyzed data cover the differences in the variables
    satisfactorily. Download : Download high-res image (359KB) Download : Download

    Also, random change, SWS, subsidy, LGA supervision, and training with p-value=0.0
    at a 95% confidence level are the most influential parameters on the SWR index.
    Initial population, including seed-ratio, seed-owner, and network-density, does
    not affect the SWR index (Fig. 8). Based on Eqs. 2 and 3, the farmer''s propensity
    value for DTIM is formed based on economic prioritization and farmers'' experiences.
    The experience of farmers is indirectly related to the communication of neighbors
    and mostly depends on economic changes. Therefore, at the 95% level, the value
    of network-density does not affect SWR. Download : Download high-res image (379KB)

    SWR. The indicators of SWS, LGA supervision and training significantly affect
    crop yield and productivity, with F-value=1729.93 and F-value=1441.14, respectively.
    Supervision and training are essential in increasing WP and benefiting from LGA
    subsidies, influencing the threshold of honesty and propensity of farmer agents.
    Supervision and managing the operation of irrigation systems increases the physical
    and economic WP and crop yield, which is consistent with the results of the present
    study (Dehghani Dashtabi et al., 2020). The evaluations show that the amount of
    water consumed has decreased significantly under the effect of LGA supervision
    and training, which leads to a sustainable water supply, consistent with the results
    of the present study (Bwambale et al., 2022). The net profit and crop yield increase
    through LGA supervision and training in the operation of irrigation systems (Yousefi
    et al., 2022, Lee, 2022). The physical and economic WP and the willingness of
    farmer agents to develop technology in irrigation systems increase with LGA supervision
    and training, which is to the present study’s findings (Feder et al., 2004, Molden
    et al., 2007; Padhy et al., 2015). According to the conditions governing the water
    resources under the LU basin, by using supervision and training of irrigation
    systems, WP can be improved (Dehghanisanij et al., 2023, Taromi Aliabadi et al.,
    2019, Zhou et al., 2017). The LGA’s practical training includes operating and
    correctly DTIM, which is to the present study’s findings (Abioye et al., 2020).
    Advanced irrigation methods are a suitable solution for the optimal use of water
    resources, the development of which is in line with continuous supervision, which
    is by the present study (Adeyemi et al., 2017, Abioye et al., 2020). LGA supervision
    and training of farmer agents in the operation, maintenance, and management of
    irrigation in the field and all inputs and production must be provided continuously
    (Abioye et al., 2020). The most effective indicators at the 95% confidence level
    on FAE are uncertainty, SWS, and LGA supervision and training with p-value=0.0
    (Fig. 10). Based on Eqs. 2 and 3, the farmer''s propensity value for DTIM is formed
    based on economic prioritization and farmers'' experiences. The experience of
    farmers is indirectly related to the communication of neighbors and mostly depends
    on economic changes. Therefore, at the 95% level, the value of network-density
    does not affect FAE. Improvement of irrigation systems with adequate LGA supervision
    and training will increase FAE and crop yield, which is consistent with the results
    of the present study (Adeyemi et al., 2017). If the farmers of the study area
    participate in the development of the presented ABM model, the upper limit of
    the number of farmers can be estimated up to 20,000 (persons) and have 45,000 ha
    of farms, and there is a social network and social relations of local farmers
    in each sub-basin. According to the results and assuming the existence of similar
    social and climatic patterns affecting farmers'' decisions, it can be estimated
    that by considering 200 billion IRR ($40,000) of government facilities and the
    creation of supervision and training teams, the expected FAE (20%) can be increased
    during 60 months. Download : Download high-res image (369KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 10. The effect of input indicators on the amount of subsidy
    count. The improvement of irrigation systems with the existing management of farmer
    agents is not economically justified (Yohannes et al., 2017). Examination shows
    that expanding advanced irrigation systems increases FAE from 37% to 60%. Success
    in increasing the FAE of advanced irrigation systems and DTIM requires proper
    management and sufficient supervision (Koech et al., 2018; Abioye et al., 2020).
    In a similar study, it was concluded that LGA supervision and training are effective
    in DTIM by farmers, which is consistent with the results of the present study
    (Churchill et al., 2017). Feizabadi and Gorji (2018) concluded that institutional,
    legal, educational, promotional, economic, and technical factors affect water
    resources management. Rezaee et al. (2020) positively evaluated the influence
    of social factors and facilitating conditions in adapting advanced irrigation
    methods, which is consistent with the results of the present study. At the 95%
    confidence level, the indicators of the influence of the farmer’s neighbors (network-density),
    random change, SWS, policies of granting facilities, LGA supervision and training
    with p-value=0.0 are the most practical parameters on the subsidy count index.
    Initial population, seed-ratio, and seed-owner do not affect the subsidy count
    index. The index of LGA supervision and training with F-value=7346.79 significantly
    affects the level of LGA subsidy. supervision and training play an essential role
    in the farmer agent’s willingness to benefit from LGA facilities due to the effect
    on farmers’ honesty threshold and propensity (Fig. 9). Download : Download high-res
    image (368KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 9. The effect of input
    indicators on the amount of FAE. The results showed that the financial costs of
    DTIM are essential for the farmer agent. Considering the subsidy increases the
    WP and is effective as a policy to deal with drought conditions. Subsidized incentives
    for DTIM are more effective with water consumption control. The direct benefits
    resulting from the subsidies to cover the cost of DTIM indicate the change in
    the farmer agent’s income. With the increase in subsidy, the farms under surface
    irrigation will decrease. In the existing allocation system, the increase in cultivated
    farms by upgrading advanced irrigation systems is more than the amount compensated
    by the decrease in land with flood irrigation technology. This shows the increase
    in cultivated area. Simultaneously with the increase of subsidies, other farms
    are cultivated, which confirms the claims of one-time studies regarding the effects
    of irrigation water-saving policy on the basin (Brinegar and Ward, 2009). For
    this purpose, the protection of aquifers requires a fixed cultivated area. In
    addition, with the increase in LGA subsidy, the farmer agent may prefer temporary
    benefits to DTIM advantages by selling irrigation equipment. The change in irrigation
    management is controlled by the farmer agent with periodic LGA supervision and
    training. LGA supervision leads to the deprivation of subsidies. Since LGA subsidies
    have an opportunity cost, paying subsidies without proper supervision and training
    in the DTIM causes the loss of national funds (Ward, 2010, Zare et al., 2017).
    Therefore, the subsidy payment policy should be reanalyzed. In Fig. 11 and Table
    13, the mmtickfae in DTIM for different input indicators is investigated. Download

    The most effective indicators at the 95% confidence level on mmtickfae, random
    change in the system, and LGA supervision and training are with p-value=0.0. Random
    change with F-value=2978.38 has a significant effect on the mmtickfae. The increase
    in evaporation losses is one of the random change cases and one of the main reasons
    for improving irrigation systems (Playán and Mateos, 2006, Jägermeyr et al., 2015).
    Empowering farmers to be aware of economic losses in surface irrigation methods
    and LGA supervision to ensure possible costs effectively improve the irrigation
    system (Turral, 1995). Empowerment of the farmer agent leads to the highest level
    of DTIM and WP, which is consistent with the findings of the present study (Boelens
    and Vos, 2012). 4. Conclusion In this study, the ABM model was introduced as an
    efficient method for the cooperative management of water resources in the LU basin.
    The characteristics and behaviors of a group of farmers and the influence of the
    LGA’s decision on it were modeled as the primary and influential factors in the
    exploitation and DTIM of LU. Different scenarios were defined for the DTIM. The
    results showed that random change, SWS, subsidy policy, and LGA supervision and
    training with p-value= 0.0 are the most effective indicators of the willingness
    and participation of the farmer adaption to the DTIM at a confidence level of
    95%. LGA supervision and training play a fundamental role in increasing WP due
    to influencing farmer agents’ triggers of honesty and propensity. In addition,
    the LGA subsidy is an incentive to increase field application efficiency and a
    policy to deal with drought conditions. The participation of farmers through supervision
    and training leads to the DTIM. Based on the findings of the present study, by
    using ABM models, it is possible to examine different management scenarios in
    the cooperative process about feedback processes and costs and to improve management
    approaches significantly. Establishing the proper governance reform process is
    a profitable analytical direction. The ABM model presented in the present study
    can be scaled in a more expansive geographical area with more participation of
    farmers. The participation of farmers to ensure the benefits and preservation
    of sustainable water resources can be aligned with the increase in the number
    of farmers and government facilities. Increasing farmers'' participation will
    reduce the long-term costs of water resource instability (water salinity and non-cultivable
    areas) in the entire region and can encourage farmers to participate more in DTIM.
    In addition, the geographical development of the implementation of this model
    can expand the network of farmers benefiting from government facilities and supervision
    and training, and by sharing successful experiences, with a social learning approach,
    promote the increase of WP. The ABM model presented in this study can be used
    in modeling complex social patterns and evaluating LGA policies about the farmer
    agent adaptability in other countries involved in water stress. In this model,
    considering the independence and autonomy of farmers, the value of learning, patterns
    of adaptability, and evaluating the role of LGA incentive policies are significantly
    important. These studies can model the role of participation of farmers in the
    sustainable water of the region in contrast to the individual interests of each
    farmer along with their social decision-making patterns. Therefore, the use of
    these models can be recommended in many countries with similar conditions. CRediT

  limitations: The study assumes conceptual conditions in the ABM that may not fully
    reflect real-world dynamics, and the model's accuracy depends on the availability
    and quality of data for calibration and validation.
  relevance_evaluation: Relevant - The paper provides a clear and detailed description
    of the agent-based model (ABM) developed to simulate automated irrigation systems
    and their impact on crop yield and management. Specific metrics are defined to
    evaluate the effectiveness of the ABM in capturing key aspects of the system,
    including the propensity of farmers to adopt improved irrigation technology, the
    speed of adoption, field application efficiency, and LGA expenditure.

  description: Precision agriculture (PA), also known as “site-specific management
    (SSM)”, “prescription farming”, or “variable-rate technology”, offers a practical
    option to address the rising food demand for optimal and sustainable agriculture.
    Effectively identifying and analysing the spatial and temporal changes in the
    fields requires the application of agriculture sciences and information technologies.
    To sustainably conserve natural resources, including water, air, and soil quality,
    while reducing production costs, various precision agriculture approaches have
    evolved worldwide. The application of sensor-based technology and remote sensing
    modifies conventional farming methods. The agricultural industry has grown remarkably
    due to this modernization of agriculture. This study analyses every technical
    facet of precision agriculture. It looks at different sensor types and pertinent
    technology related to precision farming. Precision agriculture and the tools and
    technologies needed to implement it are also discussed, with an eye on the needs
    of small-scale farmers in developing countries.

    agriculture (PA), also known as “site-specific management (SSM)”, “prescription
    farming”, or “variable-rate technology”, offers a practical option to address
    the rising food demand for optimal and sustainable agriculture. Effectively identifying
    and analysing the spatial and temporal changes in the fields requires the application
    of agriculture sciences and information technologies. To sustainably conserve
    natural resources, including water, air, and soil quality, while reducing production
    costs, various precision agriculture approaches have evolved worldwide. The application
    of sensor-based technology and remote sensing modifies conventional farming methods.
    The agricultural industry has grown remarkably due to this modernization of agriculture.
    This study analyses every technical facet of precision agriculture. It looks at
    different sensor types and pertinent technology related to precision farming.
    Precision agriculture and the tools and technologies needed to implement it are
    also discussed, with an eye on the needs of small-scale farmers in developing

    Its Application Chapter © 2021 Precision Agriculture: Where do We Stand? A Review
    of the Adoption of Precision Agriculture Technologies on Field Crops Farms in
    Developed Countries Article 02 April 2021 1 Introduction About 50% of all households
    in India rely on agriculture as their primary source of income, making it the
    country’s most important economic sector. For 2022–23, Agriculture accounts for
    15% of the gross domestic product (GDP) of India (Anonymous, 2023). India has
    made great strides towards achieving food security since independence (Kumar et
    al., 2018). By 2025, India’s population is projected to increase to 1.5 billion
    (Kapur, 2018). To meet the consistently increasing food demand for such a large
    population using conventional farming methods is challenging. Similar to many
    other industries, agriculture has already adapted to the knowledge-based age to
    address concerns like declining total production, unethical pesticide and fertilizer
    usage, depletion of natural resources, and post-harvest losses. A closer examination
    of the situation reveals that eco-friendly technology must be developed to maximize
    crop productivity (Mondal & Basu, 2009). With the advent of information technology
    in the 1980s, the agricultural revolution officially began, as illustrated in
    Fig. 1 (Basnet & Bang, 2018). By allowing a sophisticated decision-making process
    known as precision agriculture, the development of smart wireless sensors and
    the IoT adds additional feathers to crop production and agricultural hat. The
    term “precision” began to describe agricultural fields in the 1990s. In principle,
    precision agriculture (PA) is a promising approach wherein agricultural inputs
    will be used more efficiently, resulting in increased revenue and production with
    less harm to the environment. PA is based on the application of cutting-edge information
    technologies, which involves the characterization and modelling of soil and plant
    species variety and the integration of agricultural techniques to satisfy site-specific
    requirements (Dobermann et al., 2002). This system monitors, quantifies, and reacts
    to crop variability within and between fields. In addition, this system attempts
    to increase economic returns while decreasing conventional agriculture''s energy
    input and environmental effects (Banu, 2015). Fig. 1 Revolution in agriculture
    technologies Full size image Serrano et al. (2020) assessed the influence of the
    tree canopy on the geographical and temporal variability of the soil as well as
    the productivity, quality, and floristic composition of the pasture using precision
    agriculture (PA) technology. The findings revealed the following: the positive
    impact of trees and animal grazing on soil fertility; the impact of inter-annual
    variability in precipitation on the pattern of pasture vegetative cycle; the positive
    effect of trees on pasture quality; the negative effect of trees on pasture productivity;
    and the significance of pasture floristic composition as a measure of soil constraints
    or climatic changes; the potential of technology linked with the idea of PA as
    explicit aids to decision-making assistance and for the optimization of the herbaceous
    stratum and the dynamic management of pasture in this ecological system in an
    integrated and stable manner. The interest in PA is increasing globally with the
    advancements in information technology. Various methods have been developed for
    precision agriculture based on global positioning system (GPS), geographic information
    systems (GIS), variable-rate technology (VRT), profitability, yield mapping, etc.
    (Mondal et al., 2004). Funding prospects for new hardware, software, and consulting
    sectors relevant to precision agriculture are gradually expanding (Srinivasan,
    2001). Punjab, Haryana, and other relatively more developed states in India and
    other developing nations can be incubators for cutting-edge ideas and technology
    based on local circumstances (Lang, 1992). When evaluating the use of precision
    agriculture technologies, it is essential to consider this diversity. This work
    aims to give researchers a helpful document on the future of real-time technology
    with intelligent sensors for precision agriculture. The primary objective of this
    review is to examine the advancements in precision agricultural technology and
    its application for field crops. Sensors and sensor networks for precision agriculture
    have been classified and evaluated based on the necessity of precision agriculture
    in the existing environment. Subsequently, a review of developments in precision
    agriculture technologies is conducted, including remote sensing (RS), global positioning
    system GPS, geographical information system (GIS), variable-rate technology (VRT),
    yield monitoring systems (YMS), and guidance systems (GS). Lastly, precision agriculture''s
    effect on the environment and small landowners’ access to precision farming tools
    in India has been examined. 2 Necessity of precision agriculture Currently, there
    is an urgent need for the application of precision agriculture technologies. The
    major complications related to agriculture, which necessitate the use of precision
    agriculture, are as follows (Fig. 2). Fig. 2 Need of precision agriculture technologies
    Full size image 2.1 Decline in crop productivity Today, the world''s population
    stands at 7.5 billion, increasing from 2.5 billion in 1950, 3.7 billion in 1970,
    and 6.9 billion in 2010. According to projections from the United Nations, the
    world''s population might reach 9.15 billion by 2050. As a result, we anticipate
    an average yearly growth of roughly 50 million, with an overall spike of 1.65
    billion over the coming 33 years, less than the yearly rise of 80 million between
    1970 and 2010. Food production must significantly grow by 2050 to support this
    greater population (Saha, 2017). Establish self-sufficiency for India in terms
    of the food supply is the prime concern, which has been exacerbated by the decline
    in crop productivity caused by long-term climatic changes (Anonymous, 2019), improper
    application of fertilizers, real-time monitoring of the field parameters (Mondal
    & Basu, 2009), and the constriction of agricultural land due to high operating
    costs (Dhas, 2009). To enhance crop outputs using cost-effective alternatives,
    developing and applying technologies and principles involving regulation of spatio-temporal
    variability associated with all elements of agricultural practices is imperative.
    Instead of managing an entire field based on an inaccurate average state, the
    precision farming strategy considers site-specific changes within fields, maximizing
    available resources and ensuring crop quality (Bongiovanni & Lowenberg-Deboer,
    2004). PA accommodates automation, simplifies data collection and analysis, and
    enables management decisions, such as the location of the experiment, the quantity
    of fertilizer or inputs to be applied, and the method of operation that may be
    concurrently applied. This approach ultimately leads to adequate crop quality,
    the best utilization of available land resources, and enhanced productivity. 2.2
    Excessive use of chemicals Excessive application of fertilizers contaminates various
    natural resources, including soil and groundwater. Additionally, ongoing chemical
    overdoses run the risk of destroying the inherent fertility of the soil (Auernhammer,
    2001). Consequently, farmers are advised to use the recommended amount of chemicals.
    However, insufficient information about the field''s growth patterns and soil
    properties often leads to over- or under-application of fertilizers. The PA-based
    techniques allow real-time monitoring of the field and crops, rather than relying
    on the average value and predicting the precise amount of chemicals required over
    small sub-sections and areas (Kapur, 2018). 2.3 Depreciation of natural resources
    Water used in Irrigation operations is an essential component of agriculture,
    irrespective of scale. Most farming practices depend on groundwater resources
    to meet the freshwater requirement of crops, resulting in about 85–90% of freshwater
    consumption. Over time, this has led to a severe depletion of ground water table,
    indicating a need to reduce water use by employing efficient methods (Neupane
    & Guo, 2019). Even a 10% reduction in agricultural water consumption can double
    the current amount of water accessible to the rest of the world. To achieve this,
    precision agriculture techniques such as micro-irrigation may be applied; delivering
    the exact amount of water, a plant requires right at the roots with minimal wastage
    through run-off, evaporation, or stagnation. Subsequently, laser land levellers,
    which improve the water distribution or coverage by evenly distributing the water
    in the field, can save water (Aggarwal et al., 2010). Each plant needs a certain
    amount of space to grow, and cultivation in restricted areas may lead to competition
    for soil nutrients. On the other hand, excess land use would lead to wastage of
    resources. In this regard, precision planting allows the placement of seeds at
    an adequate distance, ensuring that the roots of each plant receive sufficient
    nutrients while their shoots have access to enough sunlight. This approach maximizes
    productivity while making the best use of the available area (Bharatiya & Kale,
    2018). 2.4 Uncertainty in farmers The farmers uncertainty related to their field
    conditions or recommended input to be used in the field arises the need of precision
    farming concept. As there are recommended quantities of various farming inputs
    such as seed rate and fertilizers for farmers to be applied in the field. But
    they are uncertain for using the recommended values as they are more oriented
    to the production enhancement rather than the quantity of inputs to be used. The
    precision farming concept can provide real-time or need-based data for agriculture
    inputs, which should be applied. The precision agriculture technologies'' data
    and information enable better decision-making and lessen the risk and uncertainty
    frequently connected with agriculture (Lowenberg-DeBoer, 2003). With the help
    of precision farming technologies, farmers can have real-time or need-based information
    about the fields and apply the inputs accordingly without affecting the outcomes.
    3 Sensors and sensor networks for precision agriculture Reliable and affordable
    real-time sensor systems are indispensable implementing various PA technologies.
    Sensors allow the accessible collection of enormous amounts of field data, which
    otherwise is a time-intensive task and often involves laboratory equipment and
    analysis (Zhang et al., 2002). To measure parameters such as humidity, vegetation,
    temperature, texture, structure, nutrient level, vapour, and air, various sensors
    have been utilized. Sensor data is utilized to identify crop species, detect stress
    conditions, locate and identify pests and weeds, and track drought, soil, and
    plant conditions (Hakkim et al., 2016). The different types of sensors (Fig. 3)
    designed to sense various parameters are discussed below. Fig. 3 Classification
    of sensors for precision agriculture Full size image 3.1 Location sensors Precision
    agriculture is conceptualized around precise data-collection positioning and thus
    commonly employs location-based sensors. These sensors can determine latitude,
    longitude, and altitude within a few feet using signals from GPS (global positioning
    system) satellites. In order to triangulate a position, at least three satellites
    are needed. GPS receivers on handheld devices offer positional accuracy of about
    100 m. Using differential GPS (DGPS), this error is reduced to 2 m (Adamchuk et
    al., 2004). Further, GPS with relative positioning reduces the inaccuracy to a
    sub-centimetre level, while a real-time kinematic (RTK) GPS can keep this precision
    for moving vehicles. Various studies have reported using satellite-generated data
    for agricultural field studies (Sishodia et al., 2020). Although a few investigations
    concentrated on a single application area, such as the determination of soil properties
    (Ge et al., 2011), the estimation of evapotranspiration (ET) (Courault et al.,
    2005; Maes & Steppe, 2012); and the administration and control of disease and
    pests (Zhang et al., 2019), some included multiple application regions (Atzberger,
    2013; Mulla, 2013; Weiss et al., 2020). Dux et al. (1999) created field maps during
    field scouting using a geo-referenced audio recorder with speech recognition.
    This technique assists users in monitoring weed development, disease, and crop
    growth in the field. Furthermore, a data gathering system was created by Yule
    et al. (1999) to enable efficient recording of the performance of an agricultural
    tractor in the field. In order to analyse field variability in topology, soil
    type, and soil moisture content and to pinpoint locations in the field that require
    corrective action, performance parameters were mapped during field activities.
    Most farmers in economically developed countries can now afford commercial sensors
    that receive and interpret GPS signals, but small-scale farmers in poorer nations
    have a difficult uphill battle (Triantafyllou et al., 2019). It may be the reason
    for less adoption of sensors-based technologies in underdeveloped countries. 3.2
    Optical sensors Optical sensors such as GreenSeeker, Yara N-sensor, and SPAD (Soil
    Plant Analysis Development) meter use light to gauge the properties of soil by
    monitoring a range of light frequency reflectance in the near-infrared, mid-infrared,
    and polarized light spectrums. Such sensors are useful for various agricultural
    management tasks, including weed detection and soil fertility determination, by
    measuring the amount of organic matter, moisture content, and other factors in
    the soil (Viana et al., 2019). Stafford and Bolam (1998) mapped vegetative indices
    using a near-ground scanning radiometer placed on a tractor. Thai et al. (1999)
    employed a field spectral-imaging system with an adjustable liquid crystal filter
    in cotton and peanut fields. At a ground speed of 3.6 km h−1, an online, real-time
    soil spectrophotometer detects the spectral reflectance of the soil in the visible
    and NIR wavebands. During field testing, linear correlations were reported between
    the reflectance at particular wavelengths and other soil characteristics, such
    as moisture and organic matter levels (Shibusawa et al., 2000). Solie et al. (2000)
    estimated yield during cropping seasons by using variable-rate technology (VRT)
    to estimate nitrogen fertilizer requirements through an optical sensor that measured
    spectral brightness in the red and NIR wavebands. An infrared plant-temperature
    transducer was developed by Michels et al. (2000) to detect temperature variations
    in plants caused by water stress. To map water, nutrition, disease, and salinity
    stresses in plants, Anom et al. (2000) developed an online, real-time spectrophotometer.
    It was predicted that advancements in crop plant gene editing may make it even
    easier to distinguish between these different types of stress (Stafford, 2000).
    In order to estimate the organic matter and moisture contents of surface and subsurface
    soils, Hummel et al. (2001) used a near-infrared (NIR) soil sensor to measure
    the spectral reflectance of the soil in the range of 1600–2600 nm. Sharma et al.
    (2012) studied the tractor-mounted optical N-sensor remote sensing system that
    generates sensor biomass data by processing real-time observations with an onboard
    computer. Using its geometry, the N-sensor, which was mounted on the roof of the
    tractor at a height of 2.74 m, scanned the 46.72 m2 cropped area. It comprises
    two diode spectrometers with viewing angles of 58 and 70 degrees, fibre optics,
    and a CPU enclosed in a hard shell. The N-sensor was used to monitor nitrogen
    levels in five wheat crop plots with varying nitrogen contents (0, 40, 80, 120,
    and 160 kgN ha−1), and it was concluded that the N-sensor data showed strong connections
    with nitrogen uptake at the 35 growth stage (about 90 DS) on wheat crop. From
    the studies reviewed, it may be concluded that high spatio-temporal resolution
    and real-time data transfer enable the depiction of in-field fluctuations, making
    sensor technology highly advantageous and increasing its contribution to crop
    production. For a commercial 42-ha orchard in Spain, González-Dugo et al. (2013)
    assessed the utility of thermal imaging from a thermographic camera for irrigation
    management by employing it as a water stress indicator. The findings demonstrated
    the value of thermal imaging as a tool for appropriately scheduling orchard irrigation.
    By assessing the health of soil and plants, Cao et al. (2013) examined the viability
    of the GreenSeeker and Minolta SPAD-502 to suggest nitrogen fertilizer. In order
    to calculate the amount of required nitrogen fertilization for the crop by the
    desired productivity, GreenSeeker measures the Normalized Difference Vegetation
    Index (NDVI), and Minolta SPAD-502 uses SPAD analysis of soil plants to calculate
    the amount of chlorophyll content in plants (optical sensor). Another sensor used
    for nitrogen fertilizer is the Yara N-Sensor. It is based on spectral reflection
    in certain bands connected to the culture biomass and chlorophyll content (Kumar
    et al., 2018). 3.3 Electrical sensors Electrical sensors are used to assess the
    propensity of a material to conduct electricity. Electrical circuit behaviour
    is influenced by variations in the physical and chemical properties of soil, which
    are quantified in terms of changing electric parameters. Electrical sensors are
    now the most practical methods for mobile soil mapping owing to their quick response
    time, low cost, and excellent durability and the soil texture, salinity, organic
    matter, moisture content, and other soil properties are correlated with the soil
    maps that were obtained (Adamchuk et al., 2004). There are many types of electrical
    sensors, such as electro-chemical, electro-magnetic, and electro-mechanical or
    mechanical. Various electrical sensors are examined in the following sub-sections,
    and their present status and potential future applications are discussed. 3.3.1
    Electro-chemical sensors The spatial heterogeneity of various soil chemical characteristics
    can be evaluated either directly or indirectly via electrochemical sensors. Electro-chemical
    sensors use of ion-selective membranes, which provide a voltage output in response
    to the activity of particular ions (such as H+, K+, NO3−, and Na+). These ions
    present in the soil are detected using sensor electrodes. Such sensors provide
    details about the pH and soil nutrient levels, which is crucial for precision
    farming. Data regarding soil chemical composition can collected, processed, and
    mapped using sensors mounted on specially made sleds. Most electro-chemical ion
    detection systems employ an electrochemical transducer to convert reactions into
    potentiometric readout signals and an ion-selective membrane (ISM) containing
    specific ionophores that exclusively react with target ions. This sensor''s reference
    electrode maintains a steady voltage while the active electrode detects a particular
    target ion (Yin et al., 2020). Ayranci & Ak (2019) created a poly (2, 5-dithienylpyrrole)-detecting
    electrode-based pyrene-substituted electrochemical sensor with a limit of detection
    of 1.73 × 10−7 M for Fe2+/Fe3+ ions. The use of a electrochemically produced rhodamine-based
    conductive polymer created a solid-state sensor platform with a small limit of
    detection (3.16 × 10−8 M). Ali et al. (2020) developed a deployable electrochemical
    soil nitrate sensor by coating a printed circuit board with a nanocomposite of
    poly (3-octyl-thiophene) and molybdenum disulphide (MoS2). This membrane-based,
    ion-selective sensor is susceptible to 1–1500 ppm and can detect nitrate-nitrogen
    in soil slurries. Developing low-cost nitrate sensors that can monitor nitrates
    and other soil nutrients in solution has become the focus of various developers.
    Furthermore, a soil electrical conductivity (EC) sensor based on a four-electrode
    approach has identified several yield-limiting factors associated with non-saline
    soils (Lund et al., 2000). The subsurface of the soil can be mapped using a soil
    EC probe and an automated penetrometer (Drummond et al., 2000). In order to monitor
    the EC of soil at three depths, a sensor with eight rolling electrodes was developed
    in France (Dabas et al., 2000). Plant-available-water-holding capacity and the
    EC, as assessed before planting, can be connected (Morgan et al., 2000). Overall,
    electrochemical sensors have been widely used to detect a range of ions present
    in the soil and to deduce various crop properties and dynamics. 3.3.2 Electro-magnetic
    sensors The magnetic behaviour of various soil properties is investigated by electro-magnetic
    sensors. Since a single parameter cannot accurately predict multiple soil qualities
    simultaneously, multiple measurement approaches are used. Fan et al. (2001) attempted
    to test both the capacitive and conductive characteristics of soil. Measuring
    capacitance or the dielectric constant is a particularly efficient method to assess
    the moisture content of soil, as the dielectric constant of water is an order
    of magnitude greater than that of soil (Starr & Paltineanu, 2002). The dielectric
    soil moisture sensor is a standard electromagnetic sensor that measures the dielectric
    constant of the soil to assess water content. Throughout a farm, moisture sensors
    may be employed in conjunction with rain gauge stations to enable monitoring of
    the soil moisture levels, even in absence of vegetation. Air flow sensors are
    another class of electromagnetic sensors used to gauge many aspects of soil, such
    as compaction, structure, soil type, and moisture content. Such sensors determine
    the permeability of the soil and respond with the amount of pressure needed to
    force a specific volume of air into the ground at a specific depth. Measurements
    may be recorded statically while stationary or dynamically while moving. Further,
    an electromagnetic-induction-based Soil EC sensor is a non-contact sensor based
    on the soil productivity index. This index incorporates the effects of bulk density,
    water-holding capacity, salt, pH, and EC determined using this sensor with significant
    correlation (Myers et al., 2000). A contour map is created using a ground-penetrating
    radar to show the location of clay lenses, which control the amount and direction
    of groundwater circulation (Dulaney et al., 2000). 3.3.3 Electro-mechanical sensors
    Electro-mechanical sensors are applied in various agriculture related applications.
    It can assess the “mechanical resistance” of the soil or soil compaction. Such
    sensors use load cells or strain gauges to monitor resistive forces using a probe
    that extends far into the ground. It can measure the force applied by the roots
    to absorb water, and this principle is employed in tensiometers (e.g. Honeywell
    FSG15N1A) which is a useful tool for irrigation interventions (Padhiary & Mishra,
    2020). The electromechanical sensor was created and evaluated by Sudduth et al.
    (2000) to count corn plants as they approached the collecting chains of a combine
    header. When compared to manual counts during harvest, the sensors marginally
    underestimated the actual population. When the combine header was operated near
    to the ground level and at speeds no faster than 2 m s−1, errors were reduced.
    Sensor assessment in maize sown at different rates demonstrated an increasing
    underestimate error as population increased. This inaccuracy was proportional
    to the pace at which maize stalks passed through the sensor. After correction,
    the felt population was a good predictor of the actual, hand-counted population
    (r2 = 0.93, zero mean error). A cotton mass-flow and strength sensor was made
    using a halogen lamp and a NIR light (Keskin et al., 1999). A capacitance sensor,
    a sensor measuring the power required at the PTO shaft, a microwave sensor, and
    an NIR sensor were all examined to ascertain the moisture content of fodder (Marcotte
    et al., 1999). Ahmad et al. (1999) used a DGPS in conjunction with a chlorophyll
    metre (SPAD-502) to map nitrogen stress in corn. Rial and Han (1999) studied the
    performance of a commercial complex permittivity sensor to measure ionic nutrients.
    Furthermore, soil penetration resistance, moisture content, and organic matter
    were assessed using a penetrometer with a near-infrared reflectance sensor (Newman
    et al., 1999). An infrared thermometer was used to measure the canopy''s temperature
    to control irrigation practices (Evans et al., 2000). To gauge soil hardpan, a
    penetrometer and a soil EC sensor have been utilized (Clark et al., 2000). Different
    physical principles were used to build soil moisture-content sensors, including
    time-domain reflectivity (TDR), standing-wave ratio (Sun et al., 1999), and laser
    light depolarization (Zhang et al., 2000). Micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS)
    sensors paired with electrochemical sensing units are gaining popularity for soil
    quality assessment due to its portability, field deployment capability, and real-time
    and rapid detection. Mechanical fingers and infrared light beams were used to
    gauge cotton plant height (Searcy & Beck, 2000). A technique that evaluates soil
    resistivity to a depth of 30 cm (three measurements at once) was created by Adamchuk
    et al. (2001). Soil resistance maps were created by georeferencing these findings
    using a global positioning system. An enhanced technique that evaluates soil resistivity
    to a depth of 63 cm (eight measurements at once) was created by Andrade et al.
    (2001). Hanquet et al. (2004) used an on-the-go mechanical sensor to investigate
    the fluctuation of soil strength in an agricultural field. Two field zones divided
    up based on soil strength were validated by the maps of soil strength produced
    by their analysis. These details can be used in conjunction with mapping, demonstrating
    the variability of soil nutrients and other significant crop-soil characteristics
    to identify variables that influence or restrict production. The benefit of electrical
    sensors is that they can quickly and non-destructively quantify soil variability,
    enabling accurate soil nutrient management and monitoring. In order to enable
    precise soil nutrient management and monitoring, real-time mapping of significant
    soil chemical and physical characteristics is a prospective application for electrochemical,
    electromagnetic, and electromechanical technologies. However, it is yet unknown
    if electrical sensor fusion will be able to simultaneously quantify spatial variability
    of significant crop-soil parameters under various growth situations. The various
    electrical sensor types and their uses are listed in Table 1. Table 1 Electrical
    sensors and their applications Full size table 4 Technologies for precision agriculture
    4.1 Remote sensing (RS) Breeders frequently utilize RS to evaluate soil characteristics
    and crop growth. By giving accelerated access to agricultural attributes in comparison
    with conventional field measurements, this technique has demonstrated considerable
    potential. In this approach, the amount of electromagnetic energy reflected from
    an object is measured using the remote sensing technique of spectral reflectance
    curve. A wide variety of wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum, ranging
    from visible to microwave, enable the application of numerous sophisticated technological
    interventions, including light detection and ranging (LiDAR), fluorescence spectroscopy,
    and heat spectroscopy (Mulla, 2013). Earlier, sensors were placed inside the ground
    to measure soil organic matter. Such ground-based sensors, such as pH, humidity,
    and temperature sensors, are placed in the field to collect data, which is later
    sent remotely to bases for analysis. However, agronomists now regularly use various
    additional remote sensing technologies, including satellite-based sensors, portable
    sensors, and tractor-mounted sensors. By combining the data from ground sensors,
    farmers can make better decisions, increase agricultural output, and maximize
    the use of available resources. Weeds in crops can be located and mapped using
    remote sensing technologies that collect data from sensors on satellites or unmanned
    air vehicles (UAV) (Triantafyllou et al., 2019). With technological improvements,
    affordable drones are now readily available, which can extract relevant information
    from the photographs captured by the sensor (Barbedo, 2019; Nex et al., 2022).
    Reflective indicators have been studied to evaluate vegetation-related biophysical
    factors (Xue & Su, 2017). Mini and micro-UAVs with inexpensive and lightweight
    sensors were introduced by Nebiker et al. (2008) for use in remote sensing applications
    in agronomical research. Later, the Leaf Area Index (LAI) of the canopy was estimated
    (Mathews & Jensen, 2013) using this UAV technology. Remote sensing technology
    is a precious instrument for acquiring a large amount of information simultaneously
    (Ryu et al., 2011), and it aids in obtaining data from a distance. Data sensors
    might be handheld devices, aircraft-mounted, or satellite-based. Remote sensing
    data may be used to assess crop health (Mandal & Maity, 2013). Plant stress caused
    by moisture, nutrients, compaction, crop diseases, and other plant health issues
    is frequently visible in overhead photographs. Remote sensing may show in-season
    variability that influences agricultural productivity and can be used to make
    management changes that increase present crop profitability. Although remote sensing
    technology collects data, it is difficult to pinpoint the essential management
    component since each field has different variables, such as the time and duration
    of midseason drainage, the timing and quantity of nitrogen fertilizer application,
    and the timing of harvest. 4.2 Global positioning system (GPS) Global positioning
    system (GPS) serves as the principal navigation system, which allows a receiver
    to record real-time data, along with several parameters, such as speed of machine
    or vehicle, altitude, the area covered, and soil sampling location. These data
    can be gathered/obtained, stored, and analysed for productive and efficient farming
    techniques and operations. Several precision farming applications use a ZigBee-based
    GPS receiver coupled with the controller area network (CAN) for quick and wireless
    communication (Unal, 2020). This system uses wireless communication to transmit
    ZigBee signals to the CAN Bus, avoiding cabling costs while offering dynamic,
    adaptable, and useful communication. Integrating GPS with Green-seeker aids crop
    health monitoring and helps determine the required amount of fertilizer to be
    applied in the field (Sharma, 2018). Furthermore, furrows may be placed with an
    accuracy of 1 mm in a field using the autonomous steering system connected to
    the GPS receiver before seed sowing to save time and prevent seed waste. GPS receivers
    and yield monitors also create yield maps (Shannon et al., 2002). Additionally,
    portable GPS facilitates quick mapping of insect infestations for efficient pest-management
    and observations and records the results for later use. GPS is used extensively,
    including field mapping, fertilizer application, and crop production monitoring.
    With the expansion of field applications, GPS technology has given a new direction
    to India''s precision farming system (Dziuk, 2021; Gale, 2018). GPS has been commercially
    used for surveying of farms having diverse location and size. Optimal positioning
    information of sensors and other spatial information permits a significant reduction
    in fertilizer, pesticides, and other environmentally hazardous chemicals. The
    field area obtained via real-time investigation of field through GPS was 5–7%
    less/more than the actual value, indicating significant accuracy (Jatin et al.,
    2012). Swain and Singha (2018) used a handheld GPS receiver to map the Palli-Siksha
    Bhavana (PSB) Agricultural Farm in Sriniketan, West Bengal, while gathering data
    on crop practises and secondary study areas. The crop area was concealed from
    other land uses during the digitizing and mapping processes in the Arc View software
    environment. Additionally, the different cropping patterns were noted, and a database
    was created for record-keeping and decision-making in relation to enhanced production.
    The different areas of agriculture where GPS can be applied and are depicted in
    Table 2. Table 2 Applications area of GPS in Agriculture Full size table 4.3 Geographic
    information system (GIS) GIS is a software-aided technology that collects feature
    data and geographic coordinates to create an information map. The GIS hardware
    features a central processing unit (CPU) for capturing and processing photographs
    to gain layers of information, including soil moisture, nutrient levels, and yield
    information. Compared to conventional maps, computer-generated GIS maps offer
    more data about yield, soil surveys, rainfall, and crops. This technology examines
    characteristics and geography using statistics and spatial methodologies (Runquist
    et al., 2001). Application of GIS on the field level provides data on crop yield,
    irrigation, and soil testing. To meet the urgent need for PA applications, a variety
    of GIS programmes, including ArcView, IDRISI, SURFER, and software packages provided
    by John Deere Precision Farming Group, Agri-Logic, and Rockwell International
    are available (Ess et al., 1997). Applications such as crop health assessment
    and yield forecasting utilize images obtained from hyperspectral sensors (Deguise
    & McNairn, 2000). The wine vigour of a vineyard has been mapped using the Normalized
    Vegetation Index (NDVI) generated from a multispectral camera image (Matese et
    al., 2013). Biomass and nitrogen content are estimated using the hyperspectral
    sensor installed on the unmanned air vehicle (Pölönen et al., 2013). A relatively
    new technology called hyper-spectral sensing can gather data throughout a nearly
    continuous spectrum in the visible, NIR, and MIR wavebands (Sahoo et al., 2015).
    4.4 Grid soil sampling To create a representative map that shows changes in soil
    fertility, soil sampling is a requirement. Grid soil sampling is a method for
    determining the variability in the soil texture, nutrient level, moisture content,
    or other soil parameters on a grid basis. In this method, the entire field is
    divided into grids, and for each grid, more samples are gathered at regular intervals
    than in a standard sampling method. Representative samples collected from each
    grid are then analysed in a lab to determine agricultural inputs like fertilizer
    and water for each grid. Thereafter, an application map of the field under observation
    (complete with location coordinates) is produced. For the input (water/nutrient)
    application, this map is loaded on a tractor-mounted computer system connected
    to a variable rate applicator and a GPS receiver. According to Ferguson and Hergert
    (2009), maps created by utilizing dense and optimal grid sampling can provide
    farmers with valuable information on soil fertility for many years. According
    to Mishra et al. (2019), the grid technique performs best when big tracts of land
    available. The most common grid sizes utilized are 2-acre grids, though these
    shapes and sizes can be changed to fit the requirement and convenience. At the
    locations where intensive sampling is required, even one-acre grids are used.
    As a result, the field will be divided into equal square-shaped regions by these
    fixed-area grids, from which samples will be taken. These square-shaped spaces
    are also known as cells. Three feasible techniques for gathering samples within
    a grid have been described by Mishra et al. (2019): (1) starting at the centre
    of the grid with the GPS unit and moving outwards in multiple directions to collect
    samples from three to five sites at random and consolidate them (Fig. 4a). This
    grid-centred method can be applied consistently to any field because it is extremely
    easy. However, caution should be exercised to prevent the concentration of samples
    towards the centre point to ensure unbiased sampling. (2) Random selection of
    samples from all points on the grid, regardless of the grid centre (Fig. 4b).
    Although the sampling pattern is not uniform throughout the cells, this method
    will guarantee improved randomness. However, due to the need to access multiple
    sampling locations individually spread out over the grid area, this method could
    take longer. (3) Collection of samples at the intersections of grid lines (Fig.
    4c). This approach will mathematically integrate the values (interpolate) between
    the points and enable the creation of contour maps based on the soil nutrient
    levels. The smaller the grid area chosen, the higher the sampling intensity thus
    is increasing the costs. Fig. 4 a Grid centred soil sampling; b random sampling
    within grids; c sampling at the grid intersections Full size image Even though
    grid sampling is a promising technique, it has various shortcomings. First, increasing
    the number of soil samples cannot ensure variety capture independently. Second,
    different interpolation methods affect the data by averaging the effects of outliers
    and/or extreme peaks, leading to inaccurate suggestions. 4.5 Variable-rate technology
    (VRT) Variable-rate technology is a key component of precision agriculture in
    which inputs are administered based on crop needs using GPS, GIS, remote sensing,
    and plant/soil analysis. Sensors, automated controllers, and so on. Using field
    variability, inputs are applied at the appropriate time, right place, right quantity,
    and right way in VRT. Variability (spatial/temporal) should be present in the
    field for VRT implementation. Variable rate strategies cannot be used without
    variability; nevertheless, variability is always present in farmers'' fields,
    which expands the scope of these techniques (Chaudhary et al., 2020). VRT is classified
    into two types: 1. Map-based control: Prior to the operation, a map of application
    rates is created for the field. 2. Real-time control: Using information obtained
    throughout the process, choices on what rates to apply in different areas are
    made in real time. This necessitates using sensors to detect vital information
    while on the move and is often tailored for a specific purpose, such as herbicide
    spraying. The variable rate applicator is made up of three parts. Control computers,
    locators, and actuators are examples of these. A computer installed on a variable-rate
    applicator loads the application map (Meena & Dudwal, 2021). A real-time visible
    (VIS) and near-infrared (NIR) soil sensor-based variable rate fertilization system
    was developed for maize crops (Maleki et al., 2008). To identify the phosphorus
    (P) deficit in a plant, the number of leaves and crop yield were used as growth
    indices. The sensor with a range of 305–1711 nm was mounted at the front of the
    applicator system to forecast the soil-extractable phosphorous. The LabVIEW programme
    was then used to obtain the soil spectrum for the scanned field. Thereafter, the
    application rate of phosphorus was adjusted based on the estimated deficit. The
    application rate was updated every 4 m2 of the field crossing or scanning area.
    When plots with uniform rate (UR) and variable rate (VR) treatments were evaluated,
    the average amount of phosphate (30 kg ha−1) applied on UR plots was 1.25 kg more
    than the average amount (28.75 kg ha−1) applied on VR plots. Additionally, less
    variance (25%) in the number of plant leaves was seen in VR-treated field plots,
    indicating a more even P distribution. Furthermore, VR-treated plots displayed
    significantly higher yields (336 kg ha−1) and lower variability. Koundal et al.
    (2012) selected various components such as pulse width modulation (PWM) Raven
    Envizio Pro Controller, hydraulic motor, and zero till seed cum fertilizer drill
    for developing a Variable Rate Applicator (VRA) and evaluate its performance.
    The investigation revealed that the range of fertilizer rates was 25.53–237.93
    kg ha−1, with variations in E-Pro II controller adjustment from 1000 to 4000 and
    matching variations in hydraulic motor speed from 70 to 265 rpm. In order to identify
    real-time N deficit in the field and to apply the required amount of fertilizer,
    Mirzakhaninafchi et al. (2021) designed and developed a variable rate fertilizer
    applicator. In this technique, the pulse-width-modulation valve was designed to
    receive a signal from the N sensor and transmit it to the microcontroller system,
    which would then change the rotational speed of the hydraulic motor to rotate
    the drive shaft of the metering mechanism according to the recommended amount
    of fertilizer. Between the N sensing and fertilizer discharge, the response time
    ranged from 3.49 to 4.90 s. Fertilizer was delivered at a rate of 0.00 kg ha−1
    rather than 78.36 kg ha−1 using the designed machine, resulting in an increase
    in NDVI of 0.56–0.78 and a drop in drive shaft rotational speed of 20–0 rpm. This
    method could reduce the environmental impact of various agricultural practices,
    improving the sustainability of farming. Another variable-rate fertilizer application
    for rice (Oryza sativa L.) was recently evaluated by Mirzakhaninafchi et al. (2022).
    A nitrogen fertilizer savings of 45% as compared to recommended dose was achieved
    by using the developed applicator. The study suggested that if applied on a larger
    scale, variable-rate technology for fertilizer application could benefit farmers,
    the environment, and consumers. Environmentally, the reduction in fertilizer use
    decreases pollution, lessening the burden of farming on the surrounding ecosystem.
    Variable rate applicator (VRA) devices and their essential features and applications
    have been described by Grisso et al. (2011). Depending on the method used for
    acquiring information, VR applicators are categorized into two different types:
    sensor-based and map-based. Sensor-based applicators carry out simultaneous assessments
    of the soil and application of chemicals. The first step in this method involves
    mapping the soil spectra. Sensor-based systems typically omit complicated processing
    methods. Based on the application, VRA is classified as seeding VRA and weed control
    VRA. The commercially available on-the-go seeding VRA was developed by Trimble
    Inc., which includes a ground speed sensor to assess the soil before seeding,
    a processor to synchronize the planter width and control the seeding pace, and
    a hydraulic drive unit to control the speed of the seed meter shaft. The weed-control
    VRA are further classified into three types on the basis of the mechanism used
    to control the application: flow-based control, chemical-injection-based control
    (with a subset or with carrier), and modulated spraying-nozzle control system.
    Further, VRA is also categorized based on the parameter to be measured, such as
    nitrogen and phosphorus VRAs for monitoring and enhancing soil fertility and lime
    VRAs for managing soil pH (da Costa Lima & Mendes, 2020) Of the 108 studies conducted
    by Lambert and Lowenberg-DeBoer (2000), 63% indicated improved net returns with
    a specific precision farming technology, while 50% indicated positive net returns
    with all precision farming technologies, except yield monitoring. The exact variation
    of technologies to be applied depends on site-specific requirements; however,
    knowledge of diverse applications will enable the farmers to make informed decisions
    about the suitability of each technology. 4.6 Yield monitoring and mapping The
    yield monitoring technology was initially developed in the early 1990s and is
    now become the most common method in precision farming. In 2019, the yield monitoring
    market segment had already surpassed other competitive precision farming technologies
    in market share. From 2014 to 2020, it has grown at a compound annual growth rate
    (CAGR) of 7.17%, with market share value reaching $2.51 billion. Currently, yield
    monitoring systems have been developed for cotton (Andrade-Sanchez & Haun, 2013),
    sugarcane (Magalhes & Cerri, 2007), grains (corn, wheat, oats, soybeans; Franzen
    & Humburg, 2016), and soybeans. When a crop is being harvested, the geo-referenced
    data on grain yield and numerous other variables, such as moisture content, grain
    mass, and harvested area, are collected load-wise or field-wise. This collection
    of yield maps for at least 5 years is crucial to prevent erroneous observations
    caused by unfavourable weather conditions or unforeseen circumstances during a
    specific year. The yield maps are then averaged to aid farmers in understanding
    yield fluctuation within a field through data interpretation. By incorporating
    ground and remotely sensed observations data into a World Food Studies (WOFOST)
    crop simulation model, Tripathy et al. (2013) predicted the wheat yield in Punjab
    for 2004–05, 2006–07 and 2008–09. WOFOST could estimate crop growth by observing
    basic crop processes like photosynthesis and respiration. To this end, wheat crop
    map from multi-date Indian Remote Sensing Satellite (IRS)-Advanced Wide Field
    Sensor (AWiFS) data and Time-series normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)
    data product from SPOT-VGT obtained through remote sensing were provided as inputs.
    The soil, crop, and meteorological data collection were recorded as ground observations.
    The field area used to generate the spatial data was divided into grids with cells
    25 km2 in area. Before simulation, the model was validated using data from 2003
    to 04 after being calibrated for the wheat variety PBW-343 for 2002–03. The actual
    proportion of wheat received from the map of the remotely sensed wheat crop was
    used to simulate the wheat grain yield for each grid with a variation of less
    than 5%. To verify the accuracy of this predicted data, the actual production
    at the district level, stated by the Department of Agriculture, Govt. of India,
    for each of the three consecutive crop seasons was, compared with the estimated
    yield. A spatial yield at the state level with a root mean square error of less
    than 0.4 tonnes·ha−1 was predicted. Similarly, for mapping and tracking the cultivation
    of rice at three select locations in Tamil Nadu, India, Pazhanivelan et al. (2015)
    employed multi-temporal, high-resolution (3 m) synthetic aperture radar (SAR)
    imageries from COSMO Skymed and TerraSAR X and site-specific characteristics.
    For the estimation of yield, the seasonal rice area, Start of season (SoS) maps,
    and backscatter time series were employed. Rice classification and accuracy evaluation
    from field observations were used to create SoS maps with an accuracy range of
    (87–92%). At the block level and 87% at the district level, the yield simulation
    accuracy standards were attained. Singh et al. (2011a, 2011b) developed a batch-type
    yield monitor for grain combines to measure the spatial variation of grains. It
    has a load cell with a capacity of 700 kg and a drum size of 125 cm × 85 cm × 80
    cm. It may be used as a single unit or installed directly in a trailer. A 145
    cm × 100 cm × 85 cm auxiliary tank with a load cell installed at the bottom was
    installed in the main tank to create a combine mounted batch-type yield monitor.
    A display unit close to the driver''s seat displays the yield statistics. Evaluation
    of batch-type yield monitor resulted in a yield variability with a coefficient
    of variation (CVs) of 5.46%, 27.56%, and 35.34% at three separate locations. Such
    systems may be used for any crop or any combine, and are inexpensive and helpful
    for small and marginal areas. 4.7 Sensors for agriculture weather stations Throughout
    agricultural fields, self-contained agricultural weather stations are positioned
    in various spots. These stations use a combination of sensors to collect data
    on air temperature, soil temperature at various depths, rainfall, leaf wetness,
    chlorophyll, wind speed, dew point temperature, wind direction, relative humidity,
    solar radiation, and atmospheric pressure. These measurements are recorded at
    predetermined intervals based on the local climate and the sown crop. The gathered
    data is subsequently transmitted wirelessly at predetermined intervals to a central
    data logger. Such weather stations are appealing to farms of all sizes because
    of their portability and falling costs (Triantafyllou et al., 2019). The concept
    of integration of low-cost smart sensors and transducers based on IEEE 1451 for
    physical interfacing, ICT-enabled agricultural machinery based on ISO 11783 for
    controlling, and an energy-efficient wireless communication network (6LoWPAN)
    for device communication was first introduced by Gangwar and Tyagi (2016). The
    combination carried out automatic sensing, collaboration, synthesis, and application
    of the data to create a full package for agro-economical applications. By raising
    awareness of rural resources and their integrated use with cutting-edge technology
    devices, the Himalayan Environmental Studies and Conservation Organization (HESCO)
    is taking action to protect the environment, and enhancing the economic well-being
    of farmers in the Himalayan region (Anonymous, 2018). The company has installed
    a Dynalab weather station with an automatic data logger system to gather information
    from 8 different application-specific sensors, including wind speed, wind direction,
    wind vane, air temperature, platinum resistance, relative humidity solid state
    capacitive, atmospheric pressure bellows connected strain gauge, rain gauge tipping
    bucket, and solar radiation, before sending the information to a specific mobile
    number via global system for mobile communication (GSM) module. An IoT-based,
    low-cost, real-time, all-weather monitoring system for precision agriculture in
    India was created by Math and Dharwadkar (2018). A microcontroller called the
    ESP32 processed the data that was gathered by the rain sensor (YL-83 + LM393),
    air temperature and humidity sensor (DHT22), atmospheric pressure sensor (BMP180),
    and LDR-based intensity sensor. The data were analysed and displayed for specific
    agricultural activities using Thing Speak, a Matlab-based programme. 4.8 Weedseeker
    sensor The Weedseeker sensor detects the presence of weed and instructs a spray
    nozzle to release a precise amount of chemical, ensuring that the weed is specifically
    sprayed on and not bare ground. Such sensors work best in locations with sporadic
    weed growth. An intelligent sensing and spraying system was developed by Tian
    et al. (2000) to accurately identify weed-infested zones. A weed sensor was developed
    by Feyaerts et al. (1998) utilizing an imaging spectrograph. Based on the research
    on the spectral properties of weeds, crops, and soil, Wang et al. (2001) developed
    an optical weed sensor. Plant temperature fluctuations brought on by a green bug
    infestation were detected using an infrared plant-temperature transducer created
    by Michels et al. (2000). Besides these, numerous weed sensors are commercially
    available. For instance, Trimble has developed a dual-wavelength, LED-based optical
    sensor to identify weeds in fields. Its foundation is the idea of light reflecting
    at two different wavelengths (soil and plant). For the targeted delivery of herbicides,
    Trimble’s weed seeker spot spray system uses an optical approach based on an internal
    dual-wavelength LED light source. The presence of chlorophyll results in a specific
    reflectance profile, and the sensor compares the reflected light from soils and
    plants at two different wavelengths. The system, generally mounted on a spray
    boom, detects the presence of a plant (weed) by detecting the chlorophyll signature
    and activating a quick solenoid valve that sprays the herbicide onto the plant
    rather than the naked ground. 4.9 Guidance systems Self-propelled equipment, such
    as tractors with implements, combine harvesters, and sprayers, are indispensable
    for modern agriculture. With additional engine power, these machines enable faster
    speeds, wider working areas, and better performance. However, drivers of such
    equipment are frequently required to lead the operations over long days and night,
    in haze and dust, and on slippery soil surfaces. Therefore, any automation focused
    on guidance is beneficial to reduce the overall workload on humans and to enable
    consistent steering accuracy during a complete workday. An automatic guiding system
    that can track a moving vehicle within a range of 30 cm may replace the conventional
    equipment markers for spraying or sowing (Goddard, 1997). The functioning of farm-level
    systems usually depends on the working conditions. The advancement in communication
    and sensor technologies has motivated using navigation-based guidance systems
    in agriculture. Navigation system-assisted agricultural vehicles have reduced
    the requisite amount of effort from the operator, decreasing work arduousness
    (Thuilot et al., 2002) and the probability of fatigue. Navigation systems have
    been associated with agricultural vehicles to determine a suitable trajectory
    for the operators (Yao et al., 2005). Satellite navigation systems have replaced
    drill disk markers for making parallel swaths across a field. Consequently, the
    operators can significantly reduce skips and overlaps, which frequently occur
    while using conventional methods reliant on visual estimation of swath distance
    and/or counting rows (Grisso et al., 2009). Besides the reduction of labour intensity
    and enhancement of efficiency, such systems enable the farmers to work during
    low visibility field conditions such as dust, fog, and darkness, increasing the
    precision of tasks (Grisso et al., 2009; Thuilot et al., 2002). To summarize,
    navigation systems implemented in agricultural practices provide many advantages
    like saving fuel and operation time, ease of operation, reduction in production
    losses, and saving resources leading to an overall increase in field efficiency
    (Hamada et al., 2009). The major advantage of navigation systems (global positioning
    system and Global Navigation Satellite System) for agricultural vehicles is to
    provide absolute position measurement along with the generation of an ideal reference
    path. Navigation systems provide direct instructions to the tractor operator regarding
    the requisite extent and direction of steering wheel movement to follow a predefined
    trajectory (Santana-Fernández et al., 2010). Singh et al. (2021) examined the
    relative performance of two commercially available navigation systems—the LED
    light bar guidance system and the offset value guidance system—installed on tractors
    for tillage operations to those of tractors driven without navigator aid. The
    current study demonstrates the improvement in the performance of implements with
    navigator-assisted tillage operations. According to the study, comparative evaluations
    of two operators clearly show that the use of navigators leads to a significant
    reduction in fuel waste by reducing overlapping areas and significantly increases
    the area of soil pulverization by minimizing the missed area. The study also suggested
    that the overall performance can be further enhanced by increasing the operators’
    understanding of the navigator and directions for its use. A nine-tyne tractor-operated
    cultivator and spinner-style fertilizer spreader were assessed by Magar et al.
    (2014). In order to monitor the missing area, overlapping area, and actual productivity
    of the machines, the tractor was operated both with and without a navigator. In
    the cases where the cultivator was assisted by a navigator, the proportion of
    missing space decreased to 8.5%, as opposed to a missed space fraction of 23.5%
    of the total cultivated area when navigator was absent. Missed areas for smaller
    fields under trials were 4.2 and 14%, respectively, of the total area of 0.48
    ha. However, at a wider area of 1.62 hectares, the average percentage of missed
    are in the absence and presence of navigator trials, respectively, was 19.8 and
    5.5%. The overlapping area during cultivation without a navigator was found to
    be 0.042 ha, or 18%, as opposed to 0.006 ha, or 3%, by utilizing a navigator.
    For smaller fields, it was shown that areas of overlap during fertilizer distribution
    for experiments without and with navigators were 0.066 ha or 13.75% and 0.002
    ha or 0.4%, respectively. However, on a more extensive field, 0.027 ha, or 1.7%
    of the total area of 1.62 ha, was found without navigator trial overlap, while
    0.048 ha, or 2.9%, was observed with navigator trial overlap. In comparison with
    the actual production of the cultivator with the navigator, which was 0.75 ha
    h−1 with 8.5% missing area, the operation without the navigator produced 0.53
    ha h−1 with 23.5% missing area. The actual productivity of the satellite-guided
    cultivator was 1.42 times more than the actual output of the cultivator when operated
    without the navigator. The real productivity of the fertilizer spreader operated
    with the navigator was 1.64 times higher than that of the unit run without the
    navigator. Fertilizer spreaders with satellite navigation were roughly 1.37 times
    more productive on larger fields than spreaders without navigation. The use of
    navigators prominently enhances the area of soil pulverization by minimizing missing
    regions while significantly decreasing fuel consumption by eliminating overlapping
    areas. By improving the operators'' comprehension of the navigation and its instructions,
    the entire performance may be improved even further. A comprehensive view of various
    precision agriculture technologies is shown in Fig. 5. Fig. 5 Various precision
    agriculture technologies Full size image 5 Environmental effects of precision
    agriculture It has long been assumed that precision agriculture will benefit the
    environment. A wide range of environmental benefits are provided by a more focused
    application of inputs with less fertilizer and pesticide losses to the environment,
    decreased water use, and decreased greenhouse gas emissions. However, the scope
    of these impacts is frequently unknown or very unpredictable (Balafoutis et al.,
    2017; Zhang et al., 2002). In addition, most research highlights potential implications
    based on experimental findings or model predictions rather than actual impacts.
    Few studies demonstrate a causal relationship between precision agriculture’s
    environmental performance and actual agricultural usage. With these advices in
    mind, some of the most important environmental advantages of precision agriculture
    are summarize. 5.1 Reduction in greenhouse gas emissions Precision agriculture
    lowers greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions all around. First, because there is less
    overlap in agricultural operations, machine guidance and controlled traffic farming
    reduce fuel usage. According to Shockley et al. (2011), guidance systems can reduce
    fuel consumption by 6%, and Jensen et al. (2012) report a 25% decrease in fuel
    costs. For large-scale fields, these savings are greater and come with additional
    benefits, such as decreased soil compaction, runoff, and erosion (Balafoutis et
    al., 2017). Second, a decrease in effluents suggests, for instance, a decrease
    in nitrogen losses as ammonia and nitrogen oxides (Balafoutis et al., 2017, for
    example). Nitrous oxide emissions were reduced by 34% as a result of VRT nitrogen
    treatment in a case study on maize production in Germany (Sehy et al., 2003).
    Pampolino et al. (2007) demonstrated the ability of site-specific nutrient management
    to boost yields with increasing nitrogen fertilizer use while retaining low N2O
    emissions for locations in Southern India, the Philippines, and Southern Vietnam.
    Thirdly, if inputs are used more effectively, the indirect energy consumption
    footprint from inputs like fertilizer, seeds, and pesticides (e.g. Böcker et al.,
    2019) can be decreased. 5.2 Reduction in agriculture input losses Losses of essential
    environmental inputs are often reduced by enhancing application efficiency. In
    order to identify tree health issues and direct the application of pesticides,
    Du et al. (2008) compare airborne multispectral analysis with human inspection
    for Texas citrus production. Pesticide use was reduced by more than 90% as a result
    of the airborne multispectral method and variable-rate technology (VRT). Accordingly,
    Balafoutis et al. (2017) demonstrate that using precision application in various
    arable crops could minimize the use of herbicides by 11% to 90% across numerous
    tests. Dammer and Adamek (2012) demonstrate that sensor-based precision management
    of aphids, instead of uniform spraying, could cut insecticide use in wheat output
    by more than 13% at an experimental site in Germany. Kempenaar et al. (2018) show
    that the potential for pesticide savings (and Nitrogen) is based on a VRT of about
    25% average. Irrigation has been found to increase at variable rates and Increase
    water use efficiency, potentially leading to water savings of up to 20–25% (e.g.
    Evans et al., 2013; Sadler et al., 2005). However, findings regarding the use
    of PF in irrigation vary widely (e.g. for reference techniques and soil and weather
    conditions) (e.g. Balafoutis et al., 2017). Overall, emissions from agricultural
    systems into water bodies are reduced by the introduction of VRT (Balafoutis et
    al., 2017; Tey & Brindal, 2012). However, the current scale of these effects is
    uncertain primarily. For example, Harmel et al. (2004) reported that in a Texas
    corn experiment, VRT nitrogen application reduced total nitrogen emissions by
    4–7% compared to uniform application, but effluent water quality was similar to
    VRT''s. For case studies of potato production in the Netherlands and olive production
    in Greece, Van Evert et al. (2017) show that the introduction of VRT resulted
    in even more significant reductions in fertilizer use. VRT is not the only approach
    to curtail needless input consumption. Rejesus and Hornbaker (1999) used corn
    and soybean crop rotation modelling approach in Illinois to show that nitrate
    contamination can be reduced not only by VRT, but also by improved fertilization
    timing. 5.3 Reduction in consumption of cultivation inputs Both Aggelopoulou et
    al. (2010) with apple trees and Vatsanidou et al. (2017) with pear trees assessed
    nitrogen’s variable treatment by taking into account the plantation’s preceding
    year’s output map and calculating the quantity of N for each plant and orchard
    acreage obtained from the soil. For the same crop output, the variable application
    of N allowed for up to 38% and 53% N reductions in the yields of apples and pears,
    respectively. Using precision irrigation Conesa et al. (2021) conducted a field
    experiment in a nectarine orchard. The crop’s evapotranspiration was the base
    of irrigation dose in traditional irrigation, while the soil–water sensors monitoring
    the volumetric soil–water content using multi-depth capacitance sensors was the
    base of the precision irrigation system. In the case of precision irrigation,
    43% less water was used than with traditional irrigation. In peach trees Mounzer
    et al. (2008) used the similar procedure and reported 18% in precision irrigation
    water savings compared to the non-precision irrigation treatment. Using the same
    approach, Mounzer et al. (2008) found an 18% saving in water usage in precision
    irrigation compared to non-precision irrigation in peach plants. Precision agriculture
    eventually helps to improve the environment by minimizing the amount of cultivation/agricultural
    inputs used. In summary, the literature submits that precision agriculture positively
    affects the environment, but there is little uncertainty about the extent of these
    effects. Therefore, additional research on the environmental impacts of precision
    agriculture is needed to advocate further private and public support. 6 Precision
    farming implements in India for small land holders The agricultural environment
    is changing significantly in the twenty-first century, mainly because of precision
    farming. However, PA interventions are still in the preliminary stages of acceptance,
    even though Indian farmers are remarkably transitioning from traditional to technology-driven
    methods. One of the main limitations that has impeded the popularity of PA technology
    is the small field size since small landowners are unable to buy expensive modern
    technology. Further technical challenges, such as incompatibility with existing
    and traditional farming methods in India, high maintenance costs associated with
    sophisticated instrumentation and equipment, and limited access to relevant services
    and software, prevent Indian farmers from fully embracing precision agriculture.
    The application of precision agriculture is further hindered by the fragmented
    and diverse agricultural data, which comes from varied agro-climatic conditions.
    Additionally, the analytical and interpretive methodologies used to analyse and
    understand these data only sometimes meet local specifications. Therefore, replacing
    expensive, complex technology with simpler, more affordable alternatives must
    be the top priority. Some of the reasonably priced tools recommended for Indian
    farms, particularly in the Indo-Gangetic Plains, include the laser land leveller,
    tensiometer, leaf colour chart (LCC), paired row trench planter, and micro-irrigation
    methods. These technologies have aided in improving on-farm water use efficiency
    and other farm inputs for better yields. 6.1 Laser land leveller (LLL) Laser land
    levelling is a simple method for preparing the ground before sowing, which leads
    to increased yields and effective water use. Farmers have adopted this technology
    and micro-irrigation systems in their farms, resulting in increased grain yield
    by 13% while saving 31.8% of irrigation water for rice (Jat et al., 2003). Utilizing
    LLL for wheat resulted in an 11.9% increase in grain yield and a 13% reduction
    in water usage (Singh et al., 2011a, 2011b). Additionally, the application of
    this technology lead to energy conservation, because less water was needed to
    be pumped. The management of landscape variability through accuracy and levelling
    is anticipated to be a crucial step in controlling soil and yield variability.
    Compared to traditional levelling, laser field levelling significantly increased
    the agronomic efficiency of the applied N, P, and K in wheat and rice (Choudhary
    et al., 2002; Pal et al., 2003). LLL was featured by Trimble at the 2019 Smart
    Farm Tech Exhibition in Raipur India. For farmers struggling due to receding water
    tables, a high-accuracy laser-based land levelling device was developed specifically.
    According to research accomplished at S.V. Patel Agricultural University in Meerut,
    rice and sugarcane yields have increased by (7–8%) and (12–13%), respectively.
    Also, reductions in tractor fuel usage of up to 24% and water savings of 20–30%
    were recorded (Anonymous, 2019). Additionally, LLL enables water management optimization
    in the terrace field cropping system. (SRP, 2020). Additionally, with carefully
    levelled fields, water can be promptly regulated and optimized according to the
    needs of agricultural growth. Due to these benefits of LLL, weed issues are remedied,
    whereas crop productivity, grain quality, and water use efficiency are enhanced
    (Abdullaev et al., 2007; Agarwal & Goel, 1981; Aryal et al., 2015; Naresh et al.,
    2017). Similarly, enhanced agronomic use efficiency, decreased water usage during
    irrigation, and improved spatial and temporal management contribute to substantially
    increasing energy efficiency and curtailing greenhouse gas emissions associated
    with rice cultivation. More specifically, rice production that is carried out
    with less water usage also significantly decreases methane emissions (Sander et
    al., 2014). Several reports (Dobermann et al., 2004; Johansen, 1996; Kitchen et
    al., 1996; Pierce & Nowak, 1999; Whelan & McBratney, 2000) have declared LLL essential
    for ensuring optimal spatial and agronomic inputs in precision agriculture. In
    fact, this practice of laser land levelling is universally recommended, without
    any bias towards wealthy farmers or huge land owners. Moreover, operations require
    approximately 4–5 h per hectare of land and can be conducted once every 3 years
    to achieve superior results. Its cost-effectiveness may further be enhanced by
    hiring the machine for shorter periods or collective purchasing (Dharini, 2015).
    The operational view of the laser land leveller is shown in Fig. 6. Fig. 6 A operational
    view of laser land leveller Full size image 6.2 Tensiometer A tensiometer is an
    essential tool to detect soil moisture or water potential, defined as the force
    exerted by the roots to uptake water from the soil at the existing moisture level.
    Tensiometers are highly helpful for irrigation interventions and are widely applied
    in practice. Field tests using the PAU tensiometer technique were carried out
    at farmer’s fields throughout Punjab for scheduling irrigation to crops (Sidhu
    et al., 2008). These tests revealed that 25–30% of the irrigation water was saved
    without having any adverse effects on rice grain yield in comparison with that
    achieved with intermittent irrigation at an interval of two days. Tensiometer-based
    irrigation reduced the amount of irrigation water needed to grow rice in unlevelled
    settings by 14.9%. Since 2009, Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) has encouraged
    the paddy farmers in Punjab to utilize tensiometers. Tensiometers have been developed
    such that three coloured bands of green, yellow, and red indicate the urgency
    of irrigation, instead of the customary gauge. When the water level is green the
    tensiometer denotes adequate water level, while the yellow level suggests that
    irrigation is required. A red level indication denotes deficient water levels
    that can negatively impact the crop yield. To calculate the soil–water characteristic
    curve (SWCC), Sun et al. (2010) suggested combining a tensiometer (single electrode
    sensor) and a frequency domain approach. The proposed method showed substantial
    similarity with the traditional laboratory-based measurement method; however,
    SWCC was restricted within the matric potential range of 0–80 kPa because of the
    air-entry value of the ceramic cup and the water cavity column inside the tensiometer.
    Tensiometers were used by Sujitha and Shanmugasundaram (2017) to manage greenhouse
    marigold watering. The flower yield·ha−1 was reported at 20.4 and 17.1 tonnes
    for the inside and outside the greenhouse, respectively, after the water was applied
    using a tensiometer with a 50% depletion of the available moisture. Growing marigolds
    inside a greenhouse yields 16% more while using 34% less water than growing them
    outside, outperforming open-air marigold farming. 6.3 Leaf colour chart (LCC)
    The experience and understanding gained with field-level experiments are crucial
    components of PA. The insights gained from field observations are employed to
    make informed decisions regarding the adequate application of agricultural inputs,
    which otherwise can have devastating impacts if inappropriately used. For instance,
    improper use of nitrogen (N) fertilizer leads to nutrient waste, plant lodging,
    and environmental pollution. Farmers incur higher costs due to the overuse of
    pesticides and fertilizers, necessitating precise nitrogen application. For a
    healthy plant and environment, N must be applied at the proper time and dosage.
    Chlorophyll levels are directly correlated with nitrogen status in rice, indicated
    by leaf colour intensity. The N condition of a particular crop has been measured
    over time using a variety of instruments, including a leaf colour chart (LCC)
    and chlorophyll meters. These portable diagnostic equipment can be used to regulate
    the amount of nitrogen (N) applied to rice based on crop needs. LCC was first
    created by Japanese researchers (Furuya, 1987). Later, an upgraded version of
    the six-panel LCC was created by the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI)
    in collaboration with the agricultural research systems of various Asian nations.
    LCC is a reference tool for assessing leaf colour, owing to the six-colour panel
    representing various hues of green. Another leaf colour chart (LCC) was created
    by the International Rice Research Institute and the Philippines Rice Research
    Institute to assist farmers with real-time nitrogen management in rice production.
    Most rice farmers with limited resources could readily afford the technology because
    of its low cost. In the Indian state of West Bengal, real-time N management in
    rice was tested using LCC, which initiated farmer-participatory research (Islam
    et al., 2007). A study was undertaken to gauge the acceptance and impact of LCC
    after 3 years of validation research in the areas of intervention and nearby control
    villages. Data was gathered from 20% of randomly chosen farm households (Islam
    et al., 2007). Later, Singh et al., (2012a, 2012b) used demand-based N-fertilizer
    to irrigate wheat and used an LCC to determine a threshold leaf colour greenness.
    The application of N fertilizer based on actual demand enhanced the agronomic
    and recovery efficiencies. For real-time regulation of nitrogen in maize (Zea
    mays L.), Mathukia et al. (2014) also used LCC. A field experiment was carried
    out at the Instructional Farm of the Junagadh Agricultural University in Gujarat,
    India, over two consecutive rabi seasons (2011–2013) by applying 80 kg of nitrogen
    per hectare at LCC 4 and LCC 5, in addition to a basal dose of 20 kg of nitrogen
    per hectare divided into two splits. Even though the cultivation costs were slightly
    higher, the results showed a 62.7% increase in net returns (Rs. 25,649 ha−1) with
    higher yields than the fixed-time application. 6.4 Paired row trench planter In
    a paired row planting strategy, the seeds of a crop are sown in widely spaced
    pairs of rows to maximize light exposure to sustain dense, tall perennial grasses
    for yield enhancement or to allow intercrop plantation within the intermittent
    spaces. The collection of techniques included the paired row trench planting method
    for sugarcane, suggested by PAU, Ludhiana (Singh et al., 2011a, 2011b). Sugarcane
    trenches 32 cm wide and 20–25 cm deep were placed in two rows. The soil remaining
    between two rows was used to cover the cane sets after they had been positioned
    at the bottom of the trenches. A 90-cm gap existed between each trench. Trenches
    were created using a recently developed tractor-operated PAU trencher. In comparison
    with the flooding approach, this method has led to a significant increase in cane
    yield, simplified support operations, decreased dependence on lodging, and allowed
    conservation of 10–15% of irrigation water. In subtropical India, Singh et al.
    (2012a) investigated ways to increase sugarcane (Saccharum hybrid complex) productivity
    using modified trench planting. For 2 years, field tests were executed to examine
    the effects of different trench planting configurations for sugarcane. The combinations
    included planting in conventional furrows 90 cm apart (T1), planting in deep furrows
    (20 cm) 90 cm apart and covering setts with 2.5 cm of soil layer (T2), planting
    in paired rows at 120:60:120 cm (T3), and planting in paired rows of deep furrows
    (20 cm) at 120:60:120 cm and covering setts with 2.5 cm of soil layer (T4). Planting
    in conventional furrows 120 cm apart and covering setts with 2.5 (light irrigation
    T5). In each of the years of the trial, the T5 planting method yielded cane yields
    much higher than those of the other planting methods, at 118.7 and 121.7 tonnes·ha−1.
    Even though the modified trench method (T5) had a higher cost of cultivation due
    to a higher seed cane rate (8 tonnes ha−1) than the other planting methods (6–7
    tonnes·ha−1), a higher profit margin was still achieved due to an increase in
    sugarcane production (18.72%) as a minimum to a maximum of 27.01%. The study thus
    concluded that the modified trench method of planting (T5) offers benefits in
    generating higher yields of cane and sugar over other conventional methods of
    planting, and that would be worth adopting by farmers for increased sugarcane
    productivity in sub-tropical India. 6.5 Pneumatic precision planter Pneumatic
    planters are based on air suction mechanisms. In such planters, air is drawn through
    a rotating disc with numerous holes. Every seed in contact with the holes in the
    disc gets attached to it and is released at the desired location when suction
    is interrupted. The timing of the dropping of seeds is determined by the seed
    spacing intended. Since the seeds are controlled by air suction, no mechanical
    damage occurs (Singh et al., 2018). Precision sowing is recommended over other
    sowing techniques since it ensures more consistent seed spacing than the others
    (Yasir et al., 2012), and such accurate and precise seed planting is enabled by
    pneumatic planters. Because precise seed distribution allows each plant to receive
    the ideal amount of sunlight, water, and nutrients, increased crop yield is noted
    while preventing the wastage of expensive seeds (Singh et al., 2004). Singh et
    al. (2018) assessed multiple commercially available indigenous and imported planters
    (Fig. 7) and compared their effectiveness with the conventional ridge planting
    (farmer''s practice) approach. In comparison with ridge planting, the quality
    feed index of pneumatic planters was higher by 6.5%, and the yield was also increased
    by 3.8%, owing to the increased plant population (5.5%). However, the quality
    feed index, plant population, and output did not differ significantly between
    the planters. When compared to manual ridge planting, the overall operating cost
    of planting with pneumatic planters was 70% lower. Fig. 7 (Source: Singh et al.,
    2018) Operational view of indigenous and imported pneumatic planter. Full size
    image 6.6 Micro-irrigation methods The highly ineffective traditional methods
    of water transportation and irrigation have not only lead to tremendous water
    waste but also caused several environmental issues such as water logging, salinization,
    and soil deterioration (Madramootoo & Morrison, 2013). The most effective alternative
    for efficiently using surface and groundwater resources is to adopt current irrigation
    techniques, such as drip and sprinkler irrigation. In comparison with 50–60% for
    traditional irrigation techniques, the water consumption efficiency of these systems
    can reach up to 95%. Additionally, fertigation combined with drip irrigation produces
    the highest yields of quantity and quality while using the least amount of water
    possible. Fertigation enables the application of fertilizer in moderate doses
    at a time by the nutrient requirements of plants, ensuring that fertilizer is
    used as effectively as possible (Aakash et al., 2020). This method guarantees
    that the root zone has the proper amount of water and nutrients, meeting the long-term
    and short-term needs of the plant. Further, Kumar et al. (2015) created a micro-irrigation
    system powered by solar energy, allowing small landowners to acquire dry land
    areas. The water gathered in a small reservoir (or pond) at higher altitudes was
    elevated by a solar pumping unit and then supplied to the plant through a micro-tube
    irrigation system. Contrary to the traditional one-row command system, the gravity-fed
    micro-tubes were used in a star configuration to enable laterals to control four
    rows of crop. The system showed potential for small landowners, with a 92% uniform
    allocation. According to the “Per Drop More Crop component of Pradhan Mantri Krishi
    Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY)”, the Indian government has announced that it will provide
    up to 55% subsidy to marginal or small-scale farmers and up to 45% for other farmers
    for the installation of micro-irrigation systems, such as drip and sprinkler irrigation,
    on their farms. Such measures will facilitate the adaptation of these practical
    measures and allow maximization of productivity. 7 Summary Nearly 78% of all farmers
    in India possess small plots of land—two acres or less—to cultivate food crops.
    Hence, it is imperative to restructure the entire agricultural system towards
    low-input, high-efficiency, and sustainable farming to maximize the utilization
    of each square foot of soil. Precision farming is a method where inputs are utilized
    in specific volumes to get amplified average yields compared to conventional farming
    techniques. Precision farming offers a novel system-based answer to today''s agricultural
    difficulties, such as the need to balance production and ecological issues. It
    is built on cutting-edge information technology. It characterizes and simulates
    soil and plant species variance and combines agricultural practices to fulfil
    site-specific constraints. It maximizes economic returns while lowering agricultural
    energy input and ecological impact. The present study has reviewed various widely
    used sensors essential to developing precision agriculture technology. These technologies
    are applied to create simpler, more affordable farming equipment that dramatically
    increases crop performance. A select few of them are examined for their current
    state, potential, and potential obstacles from an Indian perspective. However,
    the biggest obstacles to successfully implementing these technologies are more
    education and awareness on precision farming methods, affordable solutions, and
    a better farming model ecosystem, considering the land size and an impending need
    for regulations concerning data security and privacy. Furthermore, precision farming
    is still a notion in numerous developing countries, and strategic assistance from
    the public and commercial sectors is required to accelerate its implementation.
    However, successful adoption requires at least three stages: exploration, analysis,
    and implementation. Precision agriculture has the potential to tackle both the
    economic and ecological issues that affect agriculture production. Although questions
    involving cost-effectiveness and the most efficient uses of existing technology
    tools persist, the notion of “doing the appropriate thing in the correct location
    at the right moment” has a significant intuitive value. Given today’s pressing
    necessity, an all-out effort should be made to leverage new technical inputs to
    transform the “Green Revolution” into an “Evergreen Revolution.” Finally, the
    success of precision agriculture is heavily dependent on how effectively and rapidly
    the information required to guide the new technology can be obtained. Data availability

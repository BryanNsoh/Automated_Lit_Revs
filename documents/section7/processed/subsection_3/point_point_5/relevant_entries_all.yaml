    With the development of modern science and technology, the development of electrical\
    \ automation engineering has also\nbecome widespread. In the traditional sense,\
    \ the wiring of the electrical automation control system is complex, the cost\n\
    is high, the maintenance is difficult and failures may easily occur, and these\
    \ factors seriously affect the system efficiency.\nThe application of PLC technology\
    \ in the field of electrical automation greatly simplifies the installation and\
    \ operation\nprocess, and improves the work efficiency. Therefore, PLC technology\
    \ has come to play an increasingly important role in\nthe efficient and stable\
    \ operation of electrical automation engineering. This paper analyses and explores\
    \ the principle and\npractical application of PLC in the field of electrical automation\
    \ engineering, and optimises the automatic control system\nbased on PLC.\nKeywords:\
    \ PLC, electrical automation, automatic control, application research\n1 Introduction\n\
    With the development of society and economy, electrical automation has come to\
    \ be widely used in many\nindustries; from industries in which merely basic construction\
    \ activity is involved to aerospace high-tech, there\nis no shortage of electrical\
    \ automation, and it has found the most extensive application in heavy industry\
    \ and\npower generation [1]. The improvement and effective use of electrical automation\
    \ can comprehensively improve\nwork quality and work efficiency, and maximise\
    \ the economic benefits obtained by enterprises [2]. A series of\nstandards has\
    \ been formulated in China to ensure the better development of electrical automation\
    \ and to improve\nthe versatility of related equipment [3]. In the 21st century,\
    \ electrical engineering and its automation technology\nare being continuously\
    \ improved and updated, and the effective integration of computer information\
    \ technology\nand electrical automation can comprehensively improve the quality\
    \ and work efficiency of the entire electrical\nautomation system, thus facilitating\
    \ it to become one of the important guarantees for the long-term development\n\
    of the Chinese economy [4].\n†Corresponding author.\nEmail address: limq@gsau.edu.cn\n\

    \ Nonlinear Sciences 8(2023) 615–624\nIn traditional electrical control, most\
    \ components of the electrical system are controlled in the form of relay\ncontact,\
    \ but relay control has the disadvantages of slow response time, high average\
    \ repair rate, complicated\nwiring, low reliability, high power consumption and\
    \ poor flexibility [5]. Therefore, an automatic control system\nwith a wide range\
    \ of applications, powerful functions and convenient use is urgently needed. The\
    \ programmable\nlogic controller appeared in response to this requirement and\
    \ has been widely used in the field of automatic\ncontrol, which has greatly promoted\
    \ an enhancement in the levels of effectiveness and efficiency for industries\n\
    that have adopted this automation [6]. The working principle of PLC is fundamentally\
    \ the same as that of a\ncomputer, and it also realises a series of task controls\
    \ through the execution of certain user programs. In terms\nof time, the PLC controller\
    \ is different from the relay control system when performing tasks [7]. In the\
    \ work of\nPLC, the method of cyclic scanning is used. This method refers to sampling\
    \ the signals in each process during\nthe running time of the program, and then\
    \ performing operations and processing on the signals. The results are\nsent to\
    \ the relevant actuators [8]. During the operating cycle of the system, some of\
    \ the input data do not change,\nand similarly, some output data remain fixed\
    \ whereas others might or might not change. In the PLC, the cycle\nscanning method\
    \ is used to continuously sample and output the input variables and output variables,\
    \ so that the\ncorresponding execution actions can be made when the conditions\
    \ are met [9].\nElectrical automation based on PLC technology is widely used in\
    \ all walks of life. In the field of agriculture,\nthrough precise control of\
    \ the supply of water and fertiliser to crops, the waste of water resources can\
    \ be reduced\nand the level of agricultural modernisation can be improved [10],\
    \ Accordingly, several studies are available in\nthe literature describing the\
    \ impact of application of this technology in agricultural automation tasks. Leedy\
    \ et\nal. [11] designed a fertiliser distribution device for a sprinkler irrigation\
    \ system to realise the integrated irrigation\nof water and fertiliser. Colaco\
    \ and Molin [12] and Chandel et al. [13] equipped the fertiliser applicator with\
    \ a\nPDA and a vehicle-mounted computer, respectively, combined with technologies\
    \ such as sensors, cameras and\nGIS positioning, to achieve accurate measurement\
    \ and control of orchard fertilisation decision-making informa-\ntion. Sarangapani\
    \ et al. [14] used two-line decoding technology and cloud computing to realise\
    \ the intelligent\nirrigation of the water and fertiliser integrated delivery\
    \ machine. Dwinugroho et al. [15] designed and opti-\nmised the mixed fertiliser\
    \ system of the three-channel bypass fertiliser applicator, and verified the stability\
    \ of\nthe whole machine structure through simulation and experiments. Boobalan\
    \ et al. [16] combined fuzzy control\nand FPGA technology to design a greenhouse\
    \ water and fertiliser integration system for online fertiliser mixing.\nThe application\
    \ results show that the system has good control performance. Yang and Cheng [17]\
    \ developed\nan intelligent irrigation system controlled and monitored by the\
    \ Android platform. In applying this system, any\nAndroid-powered mobile phone\
    \ can be used to communicate with soil moisture and temperature sensors in real\n\
    time to realise automatic irrigation of farmland and online analysis of optimal\
    \ water volume or crop yield. Liu et\nal. [18] designed a soilless cultivation\
    \ irrigation cloud system based on EC sensors, which drives the single-chip\n\
    microcomputer to control the irrigation and fertilisation devices according to\
    \ the fertiliser parameters collected\nby the wireless sensors. Ouberri et al.\
    \ [19] designed a fuzzy controller for precision irrigation nonlinear systems,\n\
    using the T-S model to achieve continuous management of multiple input variables.\
    \ Rajkumar et al. [20] estab-\nlished an intelligent fuzzy inference model for\
    \ the randomness and nonlinearity of automatic irrigation systems,\nwhich can\
    \ effectively improve their accuracy. Yadav and Shevade [21] proposed using the\
    \ WebGIS framework\nto connect discrete agricultural systems to the Internet,\
    \ and use big data analysis, AI, drones and other tech-\nnologies to achieve sustainable\
    \ promotion of precision agriculture. Stavrakoudis et al. [22] used UAV remote\n\
    sensing technology to predict the data of rice yield and fertiliser requirement,\
    \ and established a nutrient content\ninversion model of rice growth period through\
    \ multiple linear regression method to ensure accurate diagnosis of\nrice fertiliser\
    \ application.\nIn the field of urban drainage automation, Chopade [22] studied\
    \ the adaptability of automatic control systems\nunder different environmental\
    \ conditions, and used experimental tests to obtain the results; Nie and Xu [23]\n\
    mainly designed and implemented BCI-based automatic control systems. Yang and\
    \ Fu [24] focussed on research\ninto the automatic display system of drainage\
    \ systems under certain conditions, using a mobile liquid crystal\ndisplay. After\
    \ years of development, the automation level of the current sewage treatment industry\
    \ has been\nApplication of PLC technology in electrical automation engineering\n\
    617\ngreatly improved, and the related technologies of the control system have\
    \ been gradually updated and improved\n[25]. At present, the three main control\
    \ systems in the control field are PLC programmable controller system,\nFCS fieldbus\
    \ control system and DCS distributed control system [26]. Among them, the structure\
    \ of the DCS\ncontrol system is divided into three levels, including the control\
    \ station, the operation station and the instruments\nin the process. FCS realises\
    \ the organic combination of field process equipment, PLC controller and upper\n\
    computer monitoring part through the established communication network, and thus\
    \ facilitates the automation\nof field-level industrial control. FCS system is\
    \ a relatively popular development point in the current control field,\nand it\
    \ is also a popular development direction [27]. The openness, dispersion, maintainability\
    \ and operability\nof the FCS system are relatively good, and it is also simple\
    \ and easy to implement in such a way as to achieve\ncomplete onsite control.\
    \ It is being increasingly used in current industrial production applications\
    \ [28]. As a\nresult of the effective development of the development platform\
    \ and configuration software, the PLC control\nsystem has a more friendly human–machine\
    \ interface, and at the same time, the cost is reduced; thus, by opting\nfor this\
    \ system, users can economically use a control system that offers a greater capability\
    \ for friendly (i.e.\nhassle-free) human–machine interaction. The improvement\
    \ of the communication level also makes the security\nand stability of the control\
    \ system develop by leaps and bounds. The openness characteristics of PLC systems\n\
    are also generally developed based on the customised needs of users, allowing\
    \ the integration of third-party\nsoftware and hardware to make PLC more powerful\
    \ and empowering its use in a wider range.\nBased on the findings from the literature\
    \ outlined above, it is observed that PLC technology is widely used\nin various\
    \ fields of electrical automation, which greatly improves the efficiency of the\
    \ control system and sim-\nplifies the installation, monitoring, management, maintenance\
    \ and other procedures. However, it still has some\nshortcomings, such as the\
    \ efficiency still not being very high, the response time being long and the control\
    \ ac-\ncuracy being low. Therefore, this paper studies the practical application\
    \ of PLC technology in various fields of\nelectrical automation engineering, analyses\
    \ its working principle in depth and optimises the automatic control\nsystem based\
    \ on the PLC principle.\n2 Mathematical model of PLC technology and electrical\
    \ automation\nIn the electrical automation control system, the RL network is a\
    \ common loop in the electrical system, in\nwhich the resistance R and the inductance\
    \ L are constants, the voltage U is the input quantity, the current I is the\n\
    output quantity and the differential equation expressions of the input quantity\
    \ and the output quantity are such\nas indicated in Eqs (1)–(4):\nur = Ldi\ndt\
    \ +Ri\n(1)\nT = L\nR\n(2)\nK = 1\nR\n(3)\nT di\ndt +i = Kur\n(4)\nIn addition,\
    \ the RC network structure is also a common loop of the electrical system. The\
    \ resistance R and the\ncapacitance C are both constants, the voltage Ur is the\
    \ input quantity and the voltage Uc is the output quantity.\nFurther, according\
    \ to the circuit theory, the differential equation expressions of the input and\
    \ output quantities\ncan be obtained as shown in Eqs (5) and (6):\nur = Ri+ 1\n\
    C\n\x02\nidt\n(5)\nuc = 1\nC\n\x02\nidt\n(6)\n618\nLi Applied Mathematics and\
    \ Nonlinear Sciences 8(2023) 615–624\nwhere I is the current passing through the\
    \ capacitor C and the resistor R. After the equation transformation, the\ndifferential\
    \ equation expression between the input and output quantities can be obtained\
    \ as shown in Eqs (7) and\n(8):\nRCduc\ndt +uc = ur\n(7)\nT duc\ndt +uc = ur\n\
    (8)\nAt the same time, the PLC uses the armature voltage to control the DC motor\
    \ in the system, I is the excitation\ncurrent, Ua and Ia are the armature voltage\
    \ and current, M is the load torque on the motor, and are the displace-\nment\
    \ and rotational speed of the motor, respectively. Therefore, the equation expression\
    \ of the armature circuit\ncontrolled by PLC can be obtained as shown in Eq. (9):\n\
    ua = iaRa +La\ndia\ndt +ea\n(9)\nThe back EMF is proportional to the motor speed,\
    \ as shown in Eq. (10):\nea = Ka\ndθ\ndt\n(10)\nThe electromagnetic torque M generated\
    \ by the motor is proportional to the armature current I, as shown in Eq.\n(11):\n\
    M = Cia\n(11)\nThe torque balance formula on the motor is shown in Eq. (12):\n\
    M −ML = J d2θ\ndt2 + f dθ\ndt\n(12)\nEqs (9)–(12) are the dynamic and static correlations\
    \ of the armature controlled by the PLC, which is one of\nthe mathematical models\
    \ of the electrification system. The four equations mentioned above are transformed\
    \ by\nformulas to obtain the attitude equation between the input and output of\
    \ the motor, as shown in Eq. (13):\nJRa\nd3θ\ndt3 +(fRa + fLa) d2θ\ndt2 +(fRa\
    \ +CKa) dθ\ndt = Cua −RaML −La\ndML\ndt\n(13)\nSince the inductance of the motor\
    \ has little influence on the system, Eq. (13) can be simplified to Eq. (14):\n\
    JRa\nd2θ\ndt2 +(fRa +CKa) dθ\ndt = Cua −RaML\n(14)\nAt the same time, the rotational\
    \ speed of the motor is known as the input quantity, and it can be simplified\
    \ by\nusing the following Eq. (15):\nJRa\ndθ\ndt +(fRa +CKa)ω = Cua −RaML\n(15)\n\
    At the same time, PLC is in the motor drive control, in which the servo motor\
    \ drives the screw to rotate once,\nand the volume V of the object brought out\
    \ is shown in Eq. (16):\nV = FL = t (S−b)·π ·d/cosα\n(16)\nThen, every time the\
    \ screw rotates once, the mass M of the object brought out is shown in Eq. (17):\n\
    M = V ·γ ·n\n(17)\nApplication of PLC technology in electrical automation engineering\n\
    619\nFor the power model of the PLC-controlled motor drive, the motor power balance\
    \ equation can be written as\nshown in Eq. (18):\nF = m¨v0 +Cr ˙x0 +F0\n(18)\n\
    The transmission force formula of PLC-controlled servo motor is given by Eq. (19):\n\
    F = k(v−v0)\n(19)\nAfter Laplace transformation from Eqs (18) and (19), Eqs (20)–(22)\
    \ can be obtained:\nF =\n\0mS2 +CrS\n\x01\nv0(S)+F0\n(20)\nF = k[v(S)−v0(S)]\n\
    (21)\nv0(S) =\nkv(S)−F0\nmS2 +CrS+k\n(22)\nFor the motor controlled by PLC, if\
    \ the influence of the friction resistance of the screw is not considered, the\n\
    transfer function of the power model of the mechanical transmission of the servo\
    \ system can be written as shown\nin Eq. (23):\nG(S) =\nk\nmS2 +CrS+k\n(23)\n\

    \ of PLC technology in electrical automation\n3.1\nApplication of PLC in electrical\
    \ sequence control\nIn the engineering electrical automation control system, the\
    \ advantages of PLC technology are particularly\nprominent. Electrical automation\
    \ regards PLC technology as a sequential control system in many fields, and the\n\
    test practice effect of PLC is very significant. The automatic sequence function\
    \ is a feature of PLC technology,\nwhich can reasonably and effectively arrange\
    \ the sequence of electrical automation equipment, thereby reducing\nthe repetition\
    \ rate and the processing process related to electrical automation, further improving\
    \ the processing\nefficiency of electrical automation, effectively reducing the\
    \ production cost of electrical automation, and ensur-\ning that the automation\
    \ and efficiency targets are completed on time. The automation program includes\
    \ the main\nprogram and multiple functional sub-modules, and the electrical automation\
    \ sequence control is one of them.\nThe mutual assistance between the modules\
    \ can realise remote control, and can strengthen the management and\ncontrol of\
    \ related electrical automation equipment. The application of PLC technology in\
    \ sequence control can\nbe divided into primary and secondary stations, on-site\
    \ sensing and remote control, etc.; designers need to carry\nout the relevant\
    \ electrical automation program design scientifically and reasonably, so as to\
    \ achieve effective\nmanagement of electrical automation data, thereby improving\
    \ production efficiency. Also, the remote control\nfunction can reduce the occurrence\
    \ rate of safety accidents and realise the comprehensive improvement of the\n\
    control ability of electrical automation equipment.\n3.2\nApplication of PLC in\
    \ electrical control switch\nIn the operation of the traditional electrical automation\
    \ switch system, the system consumes a certain amount\nof time and a large amount\
    \ of power when starting control, and the electrical automation system is often\
    \ short-\ncircuited. The use of PLC technology can effectively solve such problems.\
    \ The rational application of PLC\n620\nLi Applied Mathematics and Nonlinear Sciences\
    \ 8(2023) 615–624\ntechnology in the control of switching electrical automation\
    \ system can effectively promote the integration of\nelectrical operation and\
    \ information editing, thereby ensuring the safety and stability of the electrical\
    \ automation\ncontrol system. At the same time, the application of PLC technology\
    \ can effectively shorten the response time\nof the relays in the electrical automation\
    \ system during operation, can control the frequency of short-circuit\naccidents\
    \ taking place in the system, and can also improve the production efficiency,\
    \ thereby avoiding the major\npitfalls or limitations typically associated with\
    \ electrical automation systems, namely loss of equipment control\nand resulting\
    \ safety issues.\n3.3\nApplication of PLC in electrical data control\nPLC technology\
    \ can strengthen the processing of electrical automation data, and is also the\
    \ main task of\nengineering electrical automation. PLC technology may be used\
    \ to carry out simple programming, conduct pre-\nliminary screening of electrical\
    \ automation information, and then perform an overall scan of the ladder diagram\n\
    inside the electrical automation equipment to obtain electrical automation data\
    \ information. In this way, the\nelectrical automation operation steps can be\
    \ optimised, the PLC running speed can be accelerated and the elec-\ntrical automation\
    \ data information can be processed more effectively. The digital information\
    \ age has imposed\nstrict requirements on data security, and given the background\
    \ of this requirement, it is noteworthy to emphasise\nthat accelerated data processing\
    \ can effectively manage data and improve the security of electrical automation\n\
    data. Since the electrical automation data control includes two parts, namely\
    \ the control part and the controlled\nobject, the electrical automation control\
    \ program can be used to collect the electrical automation data reasonably\nand\
    \ effectively, arrange the controller to compile the program, and then use statistical\
    \ methods and digitalisation\nto efficiently process data that control electrical\
    \ automation.\n3.4\nApplication of PLC in electrical closed-loop control\nThe\
    \ sequence of processing the electrical automation output information and returning\
    \ to the original begin-\nning is called electrical automation closed-loop control.\
    \ The electrical automation closed-loop control can start\nthe system operation\
    \ under the action of the feedback mechanism, and output relevant information\
    \ smoothly;\nand at the same time, it can re-input and output basic object information,\
    \ and achieve the expected effect through\nreasonable improvement. The application\
    \ of PLC technology in closed-loop control can effectively integrate the\nrunning\
    \ time of the motor in electrical automation and make a reasonable selection of\
    \ production tools, and\nthis ideally results in improvement in production quality.\
    \ PLC technology includes closed-loop control and se-\nquence control, which can\
    \ further improve the intelligence level of the control electrical automation\
    \ system, and\neffectively enhance the structure control and electrical automation\
    \ data closed-loop management.\n3.5\nApplication of PLC in automatic machining\
    \ control\nIn order to ensure the mechanical strength, the rivet necessitates\
    \ strict requirements on the processing pres-\nsure and temperature in the process\
    \ of hot pressing and forming. If the pressure is too low, the forming effect\n\
    of the rivet will be poor, which will affect its normal use. If the temperature\
    \ is too high or too low, it will affect\nthe stability of the internal structure\
    \ of the rivet and reduce its life and mechanical strength. In order to provide\n\
    the yield of rivet processing, PLC is used to automatically control the CNC machine\
    \ tool press in the process\nof rivet processing. The effect is shown in Figure\
    \ 1 and Table 1. An analysis of Figure 1 shows that when PLC\nis used to control\
    \ the pressure of the CNC machine tool for pressing rivets, when the control time\
    \ is between\n0 s and 10 s, the pressure curve of the rivet will overshoot during\
    \ the preparation process. However, with the\nincrease of PLC automatic control\
    \ time, the curve of rivet bearing pressure begins to maintain a smooth state,\n\
    and there is almost no fluctuation. Before PLC is used, the pressure change of\
    \ rivets will have a large amplitude\nand the curve will fluctuate greatly.\n\
    Table 1 illustrates the effect of temperature changes during rivet processing\
    \ on automatic control. During the\noperation of the PLC-controlled electrical\
    \ automation system, the flow of people and the changes in indoor and\nApplication\

    \ load disturbances in the rivet processing workshop. Therefore, when\nthe thermal\
    \ load disturbance multiples of the electrical automation system are different,\
    \ the effect of PLC on\nthe automatic control of CNC machine tools is tested.\
    \ The results are shown in Table 1. On analysing Table 1,\nit is inferred that\
    \ the thermal load disturbance multiple can have a certain impact on the automatic\
    \ temperature\ncontrol of the CNC machine tool. When using PLC to control the\
    \ temperature of the electrical automation\nsystem, when the disturbance multiple\
    \ is 1.0–1.6, it has no obvious influence on the PLC automatic control, and\n\
    the automatic control of the CNC machine tool temperature response time is short.\
    \ However, with the increase\nof the thermal load disturbance multiple of the\
    \ electrical automation system, there is a deviation when the PLC\nautomatically\
    \ controls the temperature of the CNC machine tool, but the maximum deviation\
    \ value is 1.49◦C,\nand the error percentage is only about 0.001. The results\
    \ show that PLC has a better effect on temperature\ncontrol of electrical equipment,\
    \ and higher precision.\n3.6\nElectrical application of PLC based on PID algorithm\
    \ in packaging\nThe control electrical automation system designed by this PLC\
    \ adopts Siemens S7-200 series PLC external\nanalogue input module EM235 to input\
    \ the signal obtained by the weighing sensor into the PLC. This module can\nconvert\
    \ the signal obtained by the sensor into (0–32,000) between the numbers. Therefore,\
    \ the design deviation\nof the electrical automation system can be converted into\
    \ (−32 to 32), and its absolute value is changed to (0–32)\n622\nLi Applied Mathematics\
    \ and Nonlinear Sciences 8(2023) 615–624\nto simplify the programming, so that\
    \ the quantisation factor is 3/16; the PID control loop number is selected as\n\
    0, and VB100 as the starting address.\nIn order to edit the fuzzy controller,\
    \ Matlab mathematical simulation software is used to input the controller\ninto\
    \ the software, and then a two-dimensional fuzzy controller is determined with\
    \ two inputs and three outputs.\nThe parameters in the editing interface select\
    \ the FIS controller type as Mamdani, and the defuzzification method\nadopts the\
    \ centre of gravity method. The minimum method is selected for inference rules,\
    \ and the maximum\nmethod is selected for synthesis rules. Then, the membership\
    \ functions of the input and output variables are\nedited, the obtained control\
    \ rules are input into the controller, the Simulink simulation simulator provided\
    \ in\nMatlab is used to conduct electrical automation simulation experiments,\
    \ and a simulation model is established\nfor the control effect of fuzzy PID control.\n\
    After the simulation is completed, the weighing system of the electrical automatic\
    \ packaging machine is run\nand debugged. Table 2 shows the weighing data in the\
    \ experiment of weighing accuracy of 200 g with 200 g/bag\nas the experimental\
    \ basis. The distribution line of the deviation corresponding to the target quality\
    \ is shown in\nFigure 2. After the above experimental analysis, it can be known\
    \ that the accuracy of the weighing system of the\npackaging machine is within\
    \ the range of ±0.1%. The production line of the bag-feeding packaging machine\n\
    is in good operation, and the improved weighing system works stably and has good\

    \ PLC technology can not only effectively improve various problems existing in\
    \ the tra-\nditional electrical automation control system, but also play a role\
    \ in controlling material loss and saving costs,\nwhich can also promote the production\
    \ efficiency and economic benefits derived by electrical automation en-\nterprises.\
    \ The use of internal model PID control algorithm strengthens the adaptability\
    \ of the controller to the\nchanges of the electrical automation system model,\
    \ better meets the control requirements of stability, accuracy\nand rapidity,\
    \ and realises the system heat source that would enable effective and efficient\
    \ operation correspond-\ning to the least amount of resource consumption; however,\
    \ the electrical automation system Fan PID param-\neters have not yet achieved\
    \ self-matching and self-adaptive functions. Therefore, it is necessary to continue\n\
    to carefully analyse a large amount of electrical automation data that have been\
    \ collected, establish electrical\nautomation system models under various working\
    \ conditions, and combine fuzzy control rules, compile fuzzy\nprograms and add\
    \ them to existing programs. In this way, the electrical automation system can\
    \ independently\nchoose to change the motor PID parameters according to different\
    \ working conditions, so that the entire electri-\ncal automation system can always\
    \ maintain efficient operation.\nIn order to further improve the accuracy of the\
    \ weighing system of the bag packaging machine based on\nthe electrical automation\
    \ system, this paper studies and analyses the PLC control system, combines the\
    \ fuzzy\ncontrol with the PID control and proposes the fuzzy control based on\
    \ the traditional PID. The control of the\nfuzzy PID control electrical automation\
    \ system in the packaging machine weighing system is realised through\nthe powerful\
    \ control effect and programming ability of PLC. The experimental results show\
    \ that the improved\nelectrical automation control system has good accuracy, the\
    \ system overshoot is small and the weighing accu-\nracy is controlled at about\
    \ ±0.1%, which better meets the requirements of accurate measurement of electrical\n\
    automation packaging machines.\nThe automatic control system of electrical equipment\
    \ based on PLC technology is designed. The PID con-\ntrol algorithm is used in\
    \ the system, and it is written into the PLC programmable electrical automation\
    \ system\ncontroller in a self-programming way. The electrical automation system\
    \ controller is used to realise electrical\nThe device is automatically controlled.\
    \ The simulation test results show that the PLC is less affected by the num-\n\
    ber of threads, and its operation is relatively stable. The spectrum efficiency\
    \ curve of the electrical automation\nsystem coincides with the ideal curve, and\
    \ it has better communication performance and good applicability.\nAcknowledgements.\n\

    Sustainability is a normative concept, building on ideas \nsuch as justice, equity\
    \ and responsibility, and based on human \nculture and society. The most cited\
    \ definition comes from the \nBrundtland's report for the UN World Commission\
    \ on \nEnvironment and Development: “development that meets the \nneeds of the\
    \ present without compromising the ability of future \ngenerations to meet their\
    \ needs” [1]. The key point in this \ndefinition is bringing together environmental\
    \ and humanitarian \nconcerns under the concept of equity (between and within\
    \ \ngenerations). It includes the concept of needs and human \nwellbeing, in particular\
    \ focusing on the world's poor, and the \nidea of limits on the environment ability\
    \ to meet these needs. It \nframes the environmental problems not as something\
    \ external \nto human society, but as a basis for our future. It includes the\
    \ \nrealization that the social and economic systems are not \nindependent of\
    \ the environment, but embedded in it, and that \nthese systems have to take into\
    \ account that we live on a \nlimited planet. Sustainability is different than\
    \ most other topics \nin science and engineering and can be defined as a “wicked\
    \ \nproblem” [2]. Wicked problems are problems that contain \nparadoxes, \nconflicts,\
    \ \nchanging \nrequirement, \ncomplex \ninterdependencies and that cannot be easily\
    \ modeled by \ntraditional scientific approaches [3]. Sustainability research\
    \ and \npractice makes extensive use of modeling tools and quantitative \ntechniques\
    \ such as life cycle assessment (LCA) [4] that may \nseem less normative, but\
    \ that embed also political ideological \nand ethical values [5].  \nICT for sustainability\
    \ (ICT4S) is a growing research area \nexploring the use of information technologies\
    \ with a \nsustainability purpose [6]. Most ICT4S research has focused \neither\
    \ on understanding the negative direct impacts of hardware \nsuch as energy use\
    \ of internet [7,8,9] and the generation of e-\nwaste [10], or on the applications\
    \ of using the technologies \nwith a sustainability purpose, such as increasing\
    \ the efficiency \nof systems and increasing dematerialization [11] or triggering\
    \ \nbehavioral change [12]. Computer technologies are treated \neither as a system\
    \ to be understood, or as tools that can be used \nfor some purpose. This paper\
    \ argues that this focus on \ncomputers as tools, without reflecting upon the\
    \ bias coming \nfrom their cultural context and history, creates problems and\
    \ \nblindspots that are worth bringing attention to. First the paper \npresents\
    \ the focus on quantitative data, central to the \naffordances provided by computer\
    \ technologies, as a key \ncomponent of ICT4S. Second, it discusses new characteristics\
    \ \nand approaches that ICT is adding to how we work with \nsustainability work.\
    \ Based on these, this paper explores some \nof the risks and blindspots of the\
    \ focus on metrics and \nquantitative data in the context of a wicked normative\
    \ problem \nsuch as sustainability. Finally, some proposals for contributions\
    \ \nand further research in this topic are proposed. \nII. IT’S ALL ABOUT THE\
    \ DATA \nIt can be argued that the applications and research in the \narea of\
    \ ICT for Sustainability are for the most part based on the \ncreation, processing\
    \ and communication of quantitative \nsustainability data [13]. This is not unexpected,\
    \ as logic and \narithmetic calculations are historically main tasks computers\
    \ \nwere created for. This text presents efficiency and behavioral \nchange as\
    \ two main topics of ICT4S that represent this focus \non quantitative data. Efficiency\
    \ is one of the key concepts that \nare heavily mentioned in the literature of\
    \ ICT for Sustainability \n[14]. Reports such as Smart2020 [11], and Greener and\
    \ Smarter \n[15], point out efficiency as the most important contribution \nthat\
    \ ICT can make to sustainability, and even as a central part \n2nd International\
    \ Conference on ICT for Sustainability (ICT4S 2014) \n© 2014. The authors - Published\
    \ by Atlantis Press\n148\nin achieving a more sustainable society in general.\
    \ In the \ncontext of ICT4S, efficiency usually means the use of ICT for \noptimizing\
    \ a system or a process with a sustainability purpose, \nfor instance reducing\
    \ the amount of energy and materials \nrequired for delivering a service or the\
    \ greenhouse gases \nproduced when creating a product. ICT has always been used\
    \ \nto increase efficiency, specially time-efficiency, accelerating \nexisting\
    \ processes [16]. This acceleration is the defining \ncharacteristic of the impact\
    \ of ICT in society, and as Castells \n[17] argues, one of the pillars of the\
    \ information society. The \ncurrent discourse in ICT4S uses the terms smart or\
    \ smarter, \narguing that by measuring and controlling parameters, ICT can \n\
    tune and automate existing systems, reducing emissions and \nresource consumption\
    \ while maintaining or increasing utility. \nExamples of this include the topics\
    \ of smart cities, smart grids, \nsmart appliances, intelligent transport systems\
    \ and smart \nlogistics. Smart grid is representative for how ICT is being \n\
    applied for sustainability related efficiency. Information \ntechnologies are\
    \ used to improve the actual electricity grid \nsystem, for instance routing power\
    \ more efficiently, reducing \nthe need for excess capacity and allowing two-way\
    \ real time \ninformation exchange between producers and customers for \nreal\
    \ time demand side management. Smart grid has been \nsuggested as the single most\
    \ important application of ICT for \nreducing greenhouse gas emissions  [11].\
    \ Intelligent transport \nsystems (ITS) is also a very active research area where\
    \ the \noptimization potential of ICT is being explored, including the \noptimization\
    \ of storage and transportation of goods [11]. ICT \napplications that are suggested\
    \ to increase efficiency include \ninventory reduction, eco-driving, route optimization\
    \ and \nintermodal shifts. A particular example is the computer models \nused\
    \ by Japan National Institute of Informatics for calculating \nthe best possible\
    \ delivery route between different stores and \nproviders, creating both economical\
    \ and environmental savings \n[18]. Efficiency measures are also being applied\
    \ to other fields, \nsuch as agriculture. For instance ICT based smart irrigation\
    \ \nsystems to reduce water usage and carbon emissions by \ncontext-aware watering\
    \ schedules, using weather data and/or \nsoil moisture and evapotranspiration\
    \ sensing [19]. \nAnother central theme of ICT for sustainability is the use of\
    \ \ntechnology for supporting or triggering behavioral change \ntowards sustainability.\
    \ This includes research on eco-feedback, \npersuasive technologies, ambient awareness\
    \ and pervasive and \nparticipatory sensing. This kind of research is most prominent\
    \ \nin the area of Sustainable HCI. Di Salvo et al [12] in their \nsurvey of the\
    \ research area found that 70% of the publication \ncorpus on sustainable HCI\
    \ was on persuasive and ambient \nawareness. A main concept in research about\
    \ behavioral \nchange is using technology for “making the invisible visible”.\
    \ \nInformation technology is used to visualize and communicate \ndata that is\
    \ relevant for sustainability such as energy use, water \nuse or carbon dioxide\
    \ emissions [20]. This is seen as a \nprecondition for acting and increasing sustainability:\
    \ if it's \nvisible, it's actionable and then it can be made sustainable [21].\
    \ \nSome examples of applications and research looking at these \ntopics include:\
    \ research on energy meters for visualizing \nenergy consumption at home; the\
    \ use of competition and other \npersuasive techniques for reducing energy consumption;\
    \ \nprojects making energy visible, such as transparent screens \nshowing a metaphorical\
    \ tree representing energy consumption, \npower cords that make electricity consumption\
    \ visible, and \nlamps that reward low energy use [22,23]; visualization of \n\
    water usage at home using a LED lights  display in the shower \n[24]; visualization\
    \ of carbon dioxide impact in the supply chain \nof products [25]. \nMany efficiency\
    \ and behavioral change applications are \nbased on the gathering, processing\
    \ and visualization of metrics. \nEfficiency and smart solutions use ICT for gathering\
    \ \ninformation, processing it and analyzing more optimal \nsolutions, automating\
    \ processes based on the data, and getting \nfeedback from the changes. Behavioral\
    \ change applications are \nin many cases (not all) based on providing quantitative\
    \ \nfeedback (either directly or in some persuasive way such as in \ngames) to\
    \ the users to help them make better decisions and \nincrease their awareness\
    \ about the impact of their actions. \nUsing ICT for efficiency and behavioral\
    \ change provides \nopportunities and solutions that can have a positive impact\
    \ in \nsustainability. It could even be said that they are necessary. It is \n\
    difficult to change something if there is no feedback of the \nstarting state\
    \ and of how the actions performed affect it. But the \nimplicit emphasis on “what\
    \ can be measured” creates problems \nand blindspots that are worth discussing,\
    \ both for minimizing \nthe risks and for opening up new opportunities that may\
    \ be \nhidden. \nIII. NEW DATA APPROACHES \nThe use of new information technologies\
    \ in quantitative data \nalso adds special characteristics that differ from the\
    \ way \n“traditional” methods in sustainability information, in \npractices such\
    \ as LCA and environmental impact analysis. \nThese characteristics show how the\
    \ application of new \ntechnologies and approaches from ICT can transform (and\
    \ is \nalready transforming) how data is created, shared and \nvisualized in sustainability\
    \ practice [13,26,27]: \nA. Bottom up automatic data \nThe use of new technologies\
    \ such as pervasive sensing, \nmachine-readable data, and open licenses, together\
    \ with new \napproaches such as crowdsourcing and mashups, are changing \nhow\
    \ data is created and collected. These approaches can \nchange how sustainability\
    \ data is created, from a mostly \nmanual way to a more automated and bottom-up\
    \ approach, \nwhere bigger amounts of data can be processed in a more \nprogrammatic\
    \ style. With the exponential increase on the \nworld's capacity to store, communicate\
    \ and compute \ninformation and the increase of data availability connected to\
    \ \nthe physical world, the same approach could be applied to \nother products\
    \ and services.  \nCrowdsourcing is also relevant in this context, as it changes\
    \ \nthe way data can be collected to a more social bottom-up \napproach. Relevant\
    \ examples using crowdsourcing in a \nsustainability context include the gathering\
    \ of weather data \n149\n[28], the track of deforestation using satellite pictures1,\
    \ or \ninformation about supply chains [25]. Pervasive sensing is \nanother technology\
    \ that can enable the automatic gathering of \ndata. Examples of sustainability-oriented\
    \ projects exploring \nthis are: PEIR, an application from CENS at UCLA that tracks\
    \ \nthe user's location and movements using GPS and calculates \nthe CO2 impact\
    \ and the exposure to air pollution [29], and Air \nQuality Egg2, an open source\
    \ crowdfunded sensor that can \ntrack NO2 and CO concentrations as indicators\
    \ of air pollution. \nB. Real time and dynamic feedback \nOther important characteristic\
    \ is the use of real time and \ndynamic feedback that is up to date with the latest\
    \ data \navailable. This is in contrast with existing sustainability \napproaches,\
    \ such as LCA, where environmental information is \nmainly collected either in\
    \ a static, retroactive process or in a \nprognosis, scenario based approach.\
    \ Smart energy meters, that \nallow real time feedback of electricity consumption,\
    \ are a \nrepresentative example of this shift towards real time, and they \n\
    are one of the key technologies used in many ICT4S \nbehavioral change applications\
    \ such as in ambient awareness \nprojects [20,30]. This acceleration of time is\
    \ one of the main \ncharacteristics of ICT and its impact in society [17]. \n\
    C. Transparency and openness \nMuch of the existing sustainability data is published\
    \ in \ncommercial databases or expensive journal articles where the \npublic does\
    \ not have access to it, and/or written in paper or in \na text document where\
    \ a computer service cannot access it. \nApplying open licenses and machine-readable\
    \ formats to \nsustainability data can make the information more accessible \n\
    to the general public, and the machine-readability makes \npossible to easily\
    \ reuse existing data fostering new \ninnovations. There are initiatives working\
    \ in this direction. \nExamples include Earthster3, an upcoming LCA tool with\
    \ \nfocus on open source and visualization, AMEE4 a UK \ncompany that provide\
    \ environmental data in a machine-\nreadable API, ELCD5, a European LCA database\
    \ that is \naccessible for free in machine-readable XML format, and \nOpenLCA,\
    \ an open source LCA modeling software [31]. \nD. Dynamic visualization \nNew\
    \ technologies are increasing the possibilities of making \nthe visualization\
    \ more dynamic and interactive. Applications \nsuch as Webenergy6, HelsinkiCO27,\
    \ and Carbon.to [32], \nexplore this space, allowing users to interact with \n\
    environmental impact analysis, letting the users to change \nparameters of the\
    \ impact assessment and play with the results, \n                            \

    \ for better \ncommunication of quantitative information. \nE. User-driven innovation\
    \ \nThe affordances of information technologies are broadening \ninnovation [33],\
    \ and innovation is now driven not only by \nprofessionals, but also by end users\
    \ and amateurs. In the case \nof sustainability practice, the increasing availability\
    \ of data in \nopen and machine-readable formats makes it possible to \nvisualize,\
    \ transform, and remix different datasets, and to \ngenerate new innovative usages\
    \ outside the sustainability \npractice community [34]. Another key difference\
    \ of this \ndemocratization of innovation is the openness of the process, \nas\
    \ user innovations are usually freely revealed [33], which \nmakes them easier\
    \ to spread and to be adopted and adapted. \nIV. DATA BLINDNESS \nThe focus on\
    \ quantitative data together with the \ntransformative ways of working with data\
    \ using new \ninformation technologies create new risks and challenges, \nwhich\
    \ I group as “data blindness”, or the risk of trusting only \nor too much in data.\
    \ \nA. Trusting only on data \nWhile we have this focus on quantitative data,\
    \ we have to \nremember that sustainability is a “wicked problem”, not easily\
    \ \nreduced to numbers and explicitly normative. One side of this \nproblem is\
    \ that a data-driven approach focuses de-facto on \nparts of sustainability that\
    \ are possible or easy to quantify, \nwhile other areas that are more challenging\
    \ to put numbers on \nare neglected. This can be seen in the focus on energy and\
    \ CO2 \nemissions in many studies, for instance in the majority of life \ncycle\
    \ assessments of ICT [7,35], while other problems such as \ntoxicity do not get\
    \ the same attention. This can also be argued \nin the case of behavioral change\
    \ interventions, the focus on \nwhat can be measured means that there is an overrepresentation\
    \ \nof projects working for instance with electricity consumption, \nwhile other\
    \ areas that may be bigger but difficult to calculate, \nsuch as the impact of\
    \ the production of consumer goods, are \nnot being explored. \nThe focus on quantitative\
    \ data and real-time information \ncan create also a kind of time-shortsightedness.\
    \ The \nquantitative nature of the data makes it difficult to look at long-\n\
    term developments concerning the future, as there is no \nmeasured data for it.\
    \ Höjer et al. [36] argue that this is a \ncommon problem for environmental system\
    \ analysis tools, and \nthat there is a need for more prospective thinking and\
    \ \nintegrating with future studies. The real-time focus of ICT can \naccentuate\
    \ this problem, as data becomes more immediate and \nthere is less room for reflection\
    \ than in traditional \nenvironmental system analysis tools.  \nBrynjarsdóttir\
    \ et al. [37] discuss some of these problems in \nthe context of sustainable HCI,\
    \ connecting them to the culture \nof modernism, which “trust that formal, rational\
    \ methods \ncapture essentially everything that matters about a given \nsituation”.\
    \ They argue that this axiom of modernism is central \nto many of the persuasion\
    \ and behavior change projects in \nsustainable HCI, and that it narrows the view\
    \ of sustainability \n150\nassuming that the users are individuals maximizing\
    \ utility \nbased on information. They suggest that there should be a shift \n\
    to more reflection instead of prescription, and to a focus on \nsocial and cultural\
    \ practices instead of on individuals. \nB. Trusting too much on data \nAnother\
    \ problem of the focus on quantifiable data is how to \ndeal with uncertainty\
    \ and assumptions. Data such as \nenvironmental impact analysis or carbon footprints\
    \ include \nmany assumptions and modeled data, it has uncertainties and it \n\
    may not be relevant for the specific case at hand. This is \nchallenging to present\
    \ and the quantitative data may lead to a \nfalse sense of exactness, as it is\
    \ argued by Koomey et al \n[38].  These uncertainties are not a specific problem\
    \ of ICT4S, \nbut a general problem in environmental system analysis such as \n\
    LCAs, related to poor data quality, use of aggregated data and \nwrong assumptions\
    \ [39]. The assumptions in the model can \nalso be influenced by the creators’\
    \ values, while these choices \nremain mostly invisible to the users of the model.\
    \ A classical \nexample used is how the game SimCity simulates taxes so low-\n\
    taxes systems work better than more welfare oriented, thus \ncommunicating these\
    \ values to the game users as they learn by \nsimulation [40]. This blindness\
    \ to the shortcoming of modeling \ntools is connected to the modernity values\
    \ of calculability and \npredictability, the belief that everything can be numerically\
    \ \ncomputed and that we can know beforehand the outcome of \nactions [41], in\
    \ contrast with the wicked nature of \nsustainability, \nwhich \nincludes \nparadoxes,\
    \ \ncomplex \ninterdependencies and changing requirements.  \nThe problem with\
    \ uncertainties and model assumption is \naccentuated when using computer technologies\
    \ that use \nautomatic calculation, crowdsourcing, or mashup and lack the \ntextual\
    \ space for analysis and discussion available in LCAs \npublished as scientific\
    \ articles. This produces new challenges \nthat will need to be explored on how\
    \ to work, calculate and \ncommunicate the uncertainties in the results. An example\
    \ can \nbe seen in Greenalytics, a web application that uses machine-\nreadable\
    \ data and APIs to calculate dynamically the carbon \nfootprint of websites using\
    \ a mashup approach [42]. It provides \nat first sight a very accurate result\
    \ in kilograms or tons of CO2 \nwith decimal points. It includes a disclaimer,\
    \ explaining the \nuncertainties and how the result is not an accurate value but\
    \ a \nbest approximation based on the existing data. The details of \nhow the\
    \ numbers are calculated and the assumptions made are \nalso presented. But this\
    \ result includes many uncertainties and \nassumptions, and communicating these\
    \ is a challenge [42]. \nC. Trusting in the wrong data \nAnother facet if the\
    \ same problem is trusting in the wrong \ndata. Models are imperfect, and when\
    \ an impact is measured \nand optimized there might be rebound effects outside\
    \ the \nboundaries of the model. When increasing the efficiency of a \nsystem,\
    \ metrics are used to measure the efficiency, but this \nmeans that it is only\
    \ the measured metric that will be \noptimized, even if the result for the end\
    \ goal can be actually \nnegative. Hilty et al. [43] explores this problem with\
    \ efficiency, \nmeaning that the efficiency gains of using ICT have been eaten\
    \ \nup by rebound effects resulting in increasing output, not in \nreducing input.\
    \ These rebound effects can be created by the \nchoice of what is measured, in\
    \ the case of efficiency it is \nusually the ratio not the total amount. A rebound\
    \ effect is the \nlost gains in efficiency of technological progress due to that\
    \ \ncost reduction leads to increased consumption of the same \nservice, and/or\
    \ increase in other spending due to higher income \nand systemic macro-economic\
    \ effects [44]. This is not \nexclusive to ICT, but endemic to efficiency. A classical\
    \ \nexample is provided by Allenby [45], where he shows how cars \nhave increased\
    \ in fuel efficiency, but the total impact of cars \nhave grown as cars are bigger\
    \ and faster, there are many more \ncars and we drive them more. Hilty argues\
    \ that using ICT for \nefficiency measures is not an enough precondition for saving\
    \ \nresources, but that sufficiency measures, focusing on the total \namount that\
    \ is needed instead of on the efficiency ratio [46], \nand restricting input and\
    \ output are needed in order to avoid \nthese unwanted rebound effects [45]. \n\
    V. REFLECTIONS \nA focus of ICT4S research in quantitative data comes \nnaturally\
    \ from the affordances provided by ICT and by the \nimplicit values of modernity.\
    \ ICT have developed from \ncomputing tools and have transformed the way we can\
    \ manage \nquantitative information, allowing the processing and storage \nof\
    \ amounts of data that were unthinkable before. The values of \nmodernity and\
    \ informationalism focus also on the use models \nand metrics as a way, or the\
    \ way, of understanding and \ncontrolling systems and nature. The use of quantitative\
    \ data in \nICT4S is a powerful tool, improving sustainability work by \nmaking\
    \ variable visible and creating feedback mechanisms, \nand provides many opportunities\
    \ for increasing efficiency of \nsystems, measuring change, providing feedback\
    \ on behavioral \nand policy changes, etc.  \nICT can be used for sustainability\
    \ practice, showing new \nways of how sustainability data and information can\
    \ be created, \nshared and visualized through the application of new \ntechnologies\
    \ and paradigms, such as APIs, open licenses, \ncrowdsourcing, pervasive sensors\
    \ and mashups. These \ntechnologies add new affordances and transform the way\
    \ of \nworking with sustainability data: \n• \nThere is a focus on providing real\
    \ time and dynamic \nfeedback instead of using past static data. \n• \nThe data\
    \ is gathered in an automatic way from the \nbottom up, instead than top-down\
    \ approaches, using \nsensors, mashups and crowdsourcing. \n• \nThere is a focus\
    \ on transparency and openness. \n• \nData is visualized dynamically and interactively.\
    \ \n• \nThe innovation model is more open and broadened \noutside the sustainability\
    \ field.  \nThe mostly implicit focus in quantitative data in ICT4S, \ntogether\
    \ with these new ways this data is created and \ncommunicated create risks and\
    \ missed opportunities that need \nto be explored, what I call data blindness.\
    \ This can mean that \nwe trust only in data, focusing on problems and areas that\
    \ are \npossible to model, while leaving aside other aspects that are \ndifficult\
    \ or impossible to quantify, and that we trust too much \nin data, forgetting\
    \ that behind models and calculations there are \n151\nassumptions and uncertainties,\
    \ or that we may be measuring \nthe wrong things. This does not mean to oppose\
    \ to the use of \nquantitative data in ICT4S, but it suggests that more critical\
    \ \nreflection on these questions is needed in the research area. I \nwill present\
    \ some of the possible action points: \n• Developing more connections with existing\
    \ research \non these topics in more traditional disciplines. The \nlimitations\
    \ \nand \nrisks \nof \nquantitative \ndata \nin \nsustainability have been pointed\
    \ out before in \nsustainability research. Finnveden [47], for instance, \ndiscusses\
    \ the limitations in LCAs and other \nenvironmental system analysis tools and\
    \ how data \ngaps, uncertainties in data and methodology, and the \nvalues embedded,\
    \ make LCAs limited to provide \nprescription, for instance in deciding if a product\
    \ is \nbetter than another one. It is suggested that \nenvironmental analysis\
    \ can be a necessary and useful \ninput in decision making, but more as a tool\
    \ for \nlearning, helping to identify critical points and in \ngeneral to increase\
    \ the knowledge of the studied \nsystems. There is space for ICT4S research to\
    \ expand \nthe connections with sustainability research from other \ndisciplines\
    \ to gain insight about what it has been done \nalready regarding these risks.\
    \ \n• Distinguishing models as tools and models as goals: \nWhen \nfaced \nwith\
    \ \nuncertainties \nin \nmodeling \nsustainability, we can increase the quality\
    \ of the \nparameters, of the data collected, make it more real \ntime, but in\
    \ the end we still have a model, or as \nBorges wrote in on exactitude in Science,\
    \ “becomes so \nexact that only a map on the same scale as the empire \nitself\
    \ will suffice” [48]. I will argue that it is necessary \nto remind us that models\
    \ and metrics are useful tools \nbut in the end only proxies for working towards\
    \ value-\nbased human-centered sustainability. In the case of \nefficiency, a\
    \ similar effect can be observed, where the \nefficiency rate, from being a tool,\
    \ becomes a goal in \nitself. There is a risk for rebound effects where \nefficiency\
    \ (what is measured) improves, while the \ntotal impact (the original goal) increases\
    \ instead of \ndecrease.  \n• Increasing transparency: An area where ICT can \n\
    make a difference for mitigating data-blindness is \nincreasing \nthe \ntransparency\
    \ \nand \nopenness \nof \nsustainability data and studies. Much of the existing\
    \ \nsustainability data is published in commercial \ndatabases or expensive journal\
    \ articles where the \npublic does not have access to it, and/or written in \n\
    paper or in a text document where a computer service \ncannot access it. Applying\
    \ open licenses to \nsustainability data (and models) can make the \ninformation\
    \ more accessible, easier to replicate, and \nmake assumptions visible to examine.\
    \ \n• Exploring new qualitative areas and research \nmethods. A blindspot that\
    \ is worth exploring are the \napplications of ICT for areas of sustainability\
    \ and \nenvironmental impacts that are difficult to quantify \nand have therefore\
    \ been most forgotten in research. \nThis could include, as Brynjarsdottir et\
    \ al [37] \nsuggest, a focus in reflection not in prescription, and a \nshift\
    \ from behaviors to practices, going beyond the \nfocus on individual actions\
    \ and metrics towards more \nholistic society practices. This type of more qualitative\
    \ \nresearch will create also methodological challenges \nand call for more interdisciplinary\
    \ collaborations in \nICT4S. \nVI. CONCLUSIONS \n“Grownups love numbers. When\
    \ you tell them that you have \nmade a new friend, they never ask you any questions\
    \ \nabout essential matters. They never say to you, \"What \ndoes his voice sound\
    \ like? What games does he love best? \nDoes he collect butterflies?\" Instead,\
    \ they demand: \"How \nold is he? How many brothers does he have? How much \n\
    does he weigh? How much money does his father make?\" \nOnly from these figures\
    \ do they think they have learned \nanything about him. […] But certainly, for\
    \ us who \nunderstand life, figures are a matter of indifference.”  \n– Le Petit\
    \ Prince [49]  \n \nEmpowering new ways of creating, processing and \ncommunicating\
    \ sustainability data is and will be a main topic \nof ICT4S research, connected\
    \ to some of the most explored \nparts of the research field such as using technology\
    \ for \nincreasing efficiency and for providing feedback and \nfacilitating behavior\
    \ change. These are powerful ways in which \nICT can contribute to sustainability\
    \ work. But there is a need \nfor more discussion and reflection on the values\
    \ and \nassumptions behind the focus on quantitative data, making it \nmore explicit\
    \ instead than being tacit. If not, we risk the \npresented problems of trusting\
    \ only and/or too much in data or \nfocusing on the wrong data and hiding rebound\
    \ effects. It is \nespecially important to identify and work with these specific\
    \ \nproblems and risks when applying new ICT approaches that \ntransform how we\
    \ work with data using mashup approaches, \nsensors, real time data, etc. This\
    \ paper tried to open a bit more \nthis discussion and proposes some action points,\
    \ such as \nincreasing the connection to existing research on traditional \nareas\
    \ of sustainability research that have a longer tradition on \ndealing with the\
    \ limitation of quantitative data and models in \nsustainability, to use the affordances\
    \ of ICT to increase the \ntransparency of data and models, and to have a wider\
    \ \nperspective and explore possible blindspots of relevant topics \nand research\
    \ methods that we may be missing out on, and that \ncould enrich the ICT4S field.\

    G. Evans, W. M. Iversen, Y. Kim Keywords:   Decision support, Water management,
    Automation, Adaptive control systems, Irrigation controls, Sprinkler irrigation,
    Wireless networks, Sensors The development of site-specific water management systems
    for sprinkler irrigation will be a major factor in future efforts to improve the
    various efficiencies of water-use and to support a sustainable irrigated environment.
    The challenge is to develop fully integrated management systems with supporting
    elements that accurately and inexpensively sense within-field variability and
    then optimally control variable-rate water application systems in ways that account
    for the spatial variability affecting water use. Recent advances in sensor and
    wireless radio frequency (RF) technologies have enabled the development of distributed
    in-field sensor-based irrigation systems to support site-specific irrigation management.
    Thus, integration of a decision-making process with a distributed wireless sensor
    network (WSN) and providing real-time input to site-specific controls is a viable
    option. This presentation reviews research on the implementation of in-field micrometeorological
    information that was fed from a distributed wireless sensor network (WSN) and
    displayed on a geo-referenced field map in a computer base station. Low-cost Bluetooth
    wireless RF communications from both a distributed WSN and the machine controls
    monitoring of sprinkler status and global positioning system (GPS) location were
    interfaced with a computer base station for processing by a decision support program,
    which updated the instructions to the variable rate irrigation controller for
    real-time site-specific control. The decision support was optimized to adapt changes
    of crop type, irrigation pattern, and field location for instructions for individual
    sprinkler heads on how much water to apply and where. A graphical user interface
    (GUI) with a simple click-and-play menu was used, which allowed growers to remotely
    access field conditions and irrigation status at the home or office via wireless
    RF communications. (Download PDF)    (Export to EndNotes) 14 Share Facebook X

  explanation: 'The first extract is relevant to the point of focus because it discusses
    the importance of user-friendly interfaces in automated irrigation systems, especially
    for farmers who may not have a technical background. It specifically mentions
    that participatory design can be used to develop systems that are easy to use
    and tailored to the specific needs of the user.

    The second extract is also relevant because it discusses the use of soil moisture
    sensors to help plan irrigation scheduling, rather than relying solely on soil
    water balance methods. This can be particularly useful in heterogeneous plots
    where soil water content can vary significantly. The extract discusses the use
    of capacitance moisture sensors, which are frequently used in agricultural applications
    due to their accuracy and reliability.

    \ possible automated irrigation scheduling using\ndecision-support tools. These\
    \ tools help farmers to make better decisions in the management of their\nirrigation\
    \ system, thus increasing yields while preserving water resources. The aim of\
    \ this study\nis to evaluate in a commercial plot an automated irrigation system\
    \ combined with remote-sensing\ntechniques and soil mapping that allows the establishment\
    \ of regulated deﬁcit irrigation (RDI)\nstrategies. The study was carried out\
    \ over 3 years (2015–2017) in a commercial hedgerow olive\norchard of the variety\
    \ ‘Arbequina’ located in Alvarado (Extremadura, Spain). An apparent electrical\n\
    conductivity (ECa) map and a normalized diﬀerence vegetation index (NDVI) map\
    \ were generated\nto characterize the spatial variability of the plot and classify\
    \ the zones in homogeneous areas.\nThen, reference points were selected to monitor\
    \ the diﬀerent irrigation sectors. In 2015, the plot was\nirrigated according\
    \ to the farmer’s technical criteria throughout the plot. In 2016 and 2017, two\
    \ diﬀerent\nareas of the plot were irrigated applying an RDI strategy, one under\
    \ expert supervision and the other\nautomatically. The results show that in a\
    \ heterogeneous plot the use of new technologies can be useful\nto establish the\
    \ ideal location for an automatic irrigation system. Furthermore, automatic irrigation\n\
    scheduling made it possible to establish an RDI strategy recommended by an expert,\
    \ resulting in the\nhomogenization of production throughout the plot without the\
    \ need for human intervention.\nKeywords: apparent electrical conductivity; NDVI;\

    The olive (Olea europaea L.) tree has traditionally been cultivated in low-density\
    \ orchards under\nrainfed conditions due to the drought tolerance capacity of\
    \ this evergreen species [1]. However, growth\nand yield may be aﬀected by the\
    \ decrease in the photosynthetic rate of olive cultivars under rainfed\nconditions\
    \ [2]. Since the 1970s there has been a steady increase in the land area occupied\
    \ by irrigated\nolive orchards, which was accelerated by the appearance of super-high\
    \ density plantations (SHD,\n1500–2000 trees/ha) in the 1990s. The main advantage\
    \ of highly mechanized SHD systems is the\nreduction in labor costs during pruning\
    \ and harvesting. However, such systems require speciﬁc\nagronomic techniques\
    \ and are very costly to set up [3]. Irrigation is very important in SHD olive\n\
    groves to ensure high productivity, as the trees have a limited root volume, a\
    \ high leaf area index and,\nSensors 2020, 20, 2526; doi:10.3390/s20092526\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 2526\n2 of 23\nin consequence, high water demands [4,5]. However,\
    \ the application of excessive amounts of water\ncan lead to uncontrolled vigor,\
    \ the need for severe pruning to adapt the hedgerow to the operation\nof the mechanical\
    \ harvester, and low lighting in the fruiting areas, producing an imbalance between\n\
    growth and productivity [6].\nFurthermore, water is a scarce resource [7]. According\
    \ to the Food and Agriculture Organization\n(FAO) of the United Nations, agriculture\
    \ is responsible for over 70% of worldwide water consumption,\nand it is estimated\
    \ that the amounts used for irrigation will rise by 14% in the next 10 years [8].\n\
    Therefore, to cope with water scarcity and to improve the proﬁtability of SHD\
    \ olive groves, water\nsavings irrigation strategies must be used in order to\
    \ control hedgerow vigor, as canopies with greater\nproductive eﬃciency are key\
    \ to increasing the viability of these systems [9]. RDI is a management\nstrategy\
    \ that imposes water deﬁcits in phenological stages less sensitive to drought\
    \ in order to restrain\nvegetative growth while not negatively impacting yield\
    \ and fruit quality [10,11]. The phenological stage\nthat is least sensitive to\
    \ water deﬁcit in the olive tree is the period from pit hardening to veraison\
    \ [12,13].\nIrrigation scheduling requires decision-making with respect to when\
    \ and how much irrigation\nshould be applied according to crop type, crop development\
    \ and environmental conditions. The soil\nwater balance (WB) method is widely\
    \ used to determine the irrigation needs of a crop, where the\nwater inputs to\
    \ the soil-plant system must be balanced with the expected outputs. The most important\n\
    component of the WB is the crop evapotranspiration (ETc) value, which is the crop\
    \ water need that\nconsiders both evaporation from the soil and transpiration\
    \ from the plants. The ETc is estimated as\nthe product of the evapotranspiration\
    \ of a reference crop (ETo) and a crop coeﬃcient, Kc, in the form\nETc = ETo ×\
    \ Kc [14]. In this relationship, ETo represents the demand imposed by the meteorological\n\
    conditions while Kc integrates the physical and biophysical diﬀerences between\
    \ the reference crop\nand the crop which is to be estimated for evapotranspiration\
    \ [14]. Irrigation scheduling based on WB\npresents the advantage of anticipating\
    \ crop water requirements at certain times during the growing\nseason and the\
    \ possibility of planning irrigation accordingly [15]. However, this method presents\
    \ the\ndisadvantage that predicted ETc values could be inaccurate because of changes\
    \ in annual weather\npatterns and diﬀerences in the production practices for which\
    \ the Kc was developed [16]. An alternative\nto the WB-based method is to use\
    \ soil moisture sensors to help plan irrigation scheduling. This method\nconsiders\
    \ the soil as a water reserve for plant growth, and the idea is to ensure the\
    \ reserve always\nhas a suﬃcient amount of water available to the plant. Irrigation\
    \ control is based on the monitoring\nand measurements of soil water content or\
    \ water potential. Various types of these sensors have been\nused to determine\
    \ soil water content [17]. In addition to the problem of having to weigh up the\
    \ pros\nand cons of the diﬀerent sensor types, the appropriate placement of sensors\
    \ to accurately reﬂect the\nconditions experienced by the plant can be challenging\
    \ [18]. Consideration needs to be given to the\nfact that soil water content patterns\
    \ in the root zone are dynamic and inﬂuenced by soil hydraulic\nproperties, spatial\
    \ heterogeneity, crop characteristics and the irrigation system, among others.\
    \ In drip\nirrigation, the local application of irrigation water results in even\
    \ higher spatial variability in the soil\nwater content patterns formed under\
    \ the emitters [19]. In general, given the beneﬁts and drawbacks of\nthe WB-based\
    \ and soil water content monitoring methods, combining both approaches seems the\
    \ best\nway in the future to improve irrigation eﬃciency in agricultural systems:\
    \ i.e., determine the irrigation\ndose from a WB model and then adapt that dosage\
    \ through the use of sensors to the real situation of\neach plot. For this purpose,\
    \ an interactive software-based decision support system (DSS) can be used\nto\
    \ help decision-makers compile useful information from a combination of raw data,\
    \ documents and\npersonal knowledge. This information can then be deployed to\
    \ identify and solve problems, and make\noptimized decisions. The simplest DSS\
    \ designed to carry out automated irrigation consists of activating\nor deactivating\
    \ irrigation when the sensor measurements are above or below predeﬁned threshold\n\
    values [15,20–23]. A more complex proposal is a DSS which combines the WB method\
    \ with soil or\nplant sensors to readjust the ETc [24–27]. Millán et al. [28]\
    \ used a DSS that executed a pre-established\nirrigation scheduling in which RDI\
    \ was applied without human intervention in a plum crop.\nSensors 2020, 20, 2526\n\
    3 of 23\nOne aspect that complicates the eﬃcient irrigation management of crops\
    \ is plot heterogeneity,\nwhich depends on factors such as plot size, soil characteristics,\
    \ orography, previous plot uses, etc. If the\nproblem of soil spatial variability\
    \ is not taken into account, an irrigation design may not be eﬃcient [29].\nWork\
    \ on experimental plots rarely addresses these problems, which require the use\
    \ of specialist tools\nto characterize spatial variability. Remote sensing and\
    \ soil mapping are tools that can be used for\nagronomic crop management, allowing\
    \ characterization of the development of the vegetation cover\nand the large-scale\
    \ water status of the crop. Very interesting results have been obtained for olive\
    \ groves\nwith such tools [30]. Using data related to the electrical properties\
    \ of the soil and multispectral images,\neasily available at high resolution,\
    \ can be the best option to delineate diﬀerent homogeneous zones.\nFor instance,\
    \ Pedrera-Parrilla et al. [31] and Moral et al. [32] used soil electrical data\
    \ for zoning purposes,\nand Hall and Wilson [33] and Martínez-Casanovas et al.\
    \ [34] utilized vegetation indices computed\nfrom multispectral images. The use\
    \ of satellite data to evaluate changes in vegetation properties aimed\nat applications\
    \ in precision agriculture has also been investigated [35,36]. Coarse resolution\
    \ satellite\nimages are useful tools to describe the phenology of the vegetation\
    \ [37]. Crop monitoring oﬀers direct\ninformation for the analysis of the spatial\
    \ variability of the crop area. On the basis of such information\nmanagement actions\
    \ can be taken to improve production practices. The information can be used to\n\
    adjust and direct fertilization, determine crop development, adapt irrigation\
    \ to the needs of the crop,\nand schedule the harvest. One way to determine crop\
    \ development is based on the use of reﬂectance\nmeasurements, which diﬀer depending\
    \ on the type of surface and, in the case of plants, the species,\ncultivar, and\
    \ plant status [38]. From this information, the normalized diﬀerence vegetation\
    \ index\n(NDVI) can be computed (ratio of the diﬀerence of the values of reﬂectance\
    \ in the near infrared and\nred bands and their sum). It is known that NDVI is\
    \ a good indicator of the state of development of\nvegetation and, in consequence,\
    \ can be used to detect canopy diﬀerences within a ﬁeld [39].\nThe objectives\
    \ of this study were to test the technical feasibility and to evaluate the productive\n\
    response of a heterogeneous plot in an SHD olive grove cv. ‘Arbequina’ when using\
    \ a DSS to carry out\na fully automated irrigation scheduling and implementing\
    \ RDI strategies based on the information\nobtained through remote sensing and\
    \ soil monitoring.\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Site Description and Experimental\
    \ Design\nThis work was performed over the course of three years (2015–2017) in\
    \ a 9.31 ha commercial hedgerow\nolive grove (Olea europaea L.) planted with cv.\
    \ ‘Arbequina’. The farm is located in the municipality of\nAlvarado, about 16\
    \ km east of Badajoz in southwestern Spain (38◦49′27.15” N, 6◦46′ 18.39” W, datum\n\
    WGS84). The trees were planted in autumn 2007 at a density of 1.852 olive trees/ha\
    \ (4 × 1.35 m), with a\nnorth-south orientation and trained to a central axis.\
    \ The predominant soil in this field was classified as a\nHaplic Fluvisol according\
    \ to the FAO (2006). Soil maintenance involved the practice of non-tillage and\
    \ the\napplication of herbicides to ensure it remained free of weeds. The climate\
    \ of the area is Mediterranean with a\nmild Atlantic influence, with a dry season\
    \ from June to September (summer) and a wet season from October\nto May (winter)\
    \ in which 80% of total precipitation falls. Average ETo and precipitation p-values\
    \ in the area\nwere 1188.25 mm and 503.56 mm, respectively, for the 2007–2017\
    \ period. For the same period, the average\nmaximum and minimum air temperature\
    \ values were 23.49 ◦C and 9.56 ◦C, respectively. The hottest\nmonths are July\
    \ and August. Maximum temperatures of over 40 ◦C are recorded nearly every year,\
    \ with\npeak values rarely over 45 ◦C. The coolest months are December and January.\
    \ Temperatures below 0 ◦C\nare recorded every year, with minimum values rarely\
    \ below −5 ◦C. The meteorological information was\nobtained from a weather station\
    \ located in the same study plot at a height of 3 m above ground level (in\nline\
    \ with a tree row).\nTrees were irrigated daily using a drip system with a single\
    \ lateral line per tree row located close\nto the base of the tree, with pressure-compensating\
    \ drippers spaced at 0.67 m and with 1.6 L h−1\ndischarge rates. The plot is described\
    \ in more detail in Millán et al. [40].\nSensors 2020, 20, 2526\n4 of 23\n2.2.\
    \ Characterization of Spatial Variability of the Plot, Selection of Control Points\
    \ and Soil Analysis\nOne very important aspect, which complicates the eﬃcient\
    \ irrigation management of crops, is plot\nheterogeneity. When establishing an\
    \ automatic irrigation system it is, therefore, important to know the\nspatial\
    \ variation in soil and crop development. A satellite image and a Dualem-1S non-contact\
    \ sensor\n(Dualem, Inc., Milton, ON, Canada) were used to evaluate the heterogeneity\
    \ of the plot. The NDVI\nmeasurement was provided by the Sentinel-2A (European\
    \ Space Agency, ESA) satellite with an image\ntaken in August of 2015 with no\
    \ cloud cover. The image was processed and analyzed in QGIS 2.18\n(https://www.qgis.org)\
    \ using DOS1 atmospheric correction.\nThe Dualem-1S sensor was used to measure\
    \ apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) and was\nequipped with a global positioning\
    \ system (GPS) antenna. The sensor comprised a transmitter\noperating at a frequency\
    \ of 9 kHz and two receivers with diﬀerent orientations. There was a 1 m\nseparation\
    \ between the transmitter (Tx) and the two receivers (Rx). The ECa was measured\
    \ at 0–0.50 m\nand 0–1.50 m depths. The sensor was introduced into a 3 m long\
    \ polyvinyl chloride (PVC) structure\nwhich was transported by a pickup truck\
    \ traveling at an average speed of 9 km h−1. Due to the height\nof the vehicle,\
    \ ECa readings were carried out of the 0–0.40 m and 0–1.40 m soil layers, assuming\
    \ that the\nECa of the air is zero. In this study, we used the ECa measurements\
    \ of the top layer (0–0.40 m). The ECa\nmeasurements were taken in August 2015\
    \ along diﬀerent parallel transects that were approximately\n4 m apart. The Dualem-1S\
    \ was programmed to register measurements each second, and a total of\n3313 ECa\
    \ measurements were obtained in the plot. Ordinary kriging was used to develop\
    \ the ECa map.\nFigure 1a shows the soil ECa map and Figure 1b the NDVI map. ECa\
    \ is related to diﬀerent soil\ncharacteristics that directly or indirectly inﬂuence\
    \ the availability of water for cultivation. The map\nwas made in August when\
    \ the water content was mostly from irrigation. These served as the basis\nfor\
    \ determining the control points in the study plot. As seen in Figure 1a, the\
    \ values classiﬁed as\nlow, medium and high (because the ECa values may change\
    \ with diﬀerent water contents in the plot)\nallowed identiﬁcation of areas with\
    \ diﬀerent ECa values in the plot. The highest ECa values were\nfound in the southwestern,\
    \ northwestern and eastern areas of the experimental ﬁeld, corresponding to\n\
    a higher water retention capacity. Soil texture was one of variables considered\
    \ in the geostatistical\nanalysis for identifying the management zones in the\
    \ plot [40]. Analysis of the satellite image (Figure 1b)\nallowed identiﬁcation\
    \ of the areas with highest and lowest canopy crop development. The NDVI\nshowed\
    \ the highest values to be in the northern and central areas of the ﬁeld. These\
    \ intra-ﬁeld ECa and\nvigor diﬀerences are due to a complex interaction of biological,\
    \ agronomic, edaphic, anthropogenic,\ntopographic and climatic factors [32].\n\
    With the information obtained from Figure 1a,b, a new map was generated (Figure\
    \ 1c) using the\nmap algebra tool (raster calculator) in QGIS 2.18. As can be\
    \ seen in Figure 1c, three diﬀerent zones\nwere established:\n•\nZone 1 (T1):\
    \ where the ECa and NDVI values were medium or high. The sampling points 1 and\n\
    2 were found in this zone.\n•\nZone 2 (T2): where the ECa and NDVI values were\
    \ low. The sampling points 3 and 4 were found\nin this zone.\n•\nZone 3 (CR):\
    \ where the ECa values were low and the NDVI values were medium or high.\nThe\
    \ sampling control points CR1, CR2, CR3 and CR4 were found in this zone.\nThe\
    \ maps made during the ﬁrst year served as a basis to establish in the following\
    \ seasons in situ\ncontrol areas. Each control area consisted of 3 rows of 6 trees\
    \ each. The various measurements that\nwere subsequently taken were made in the\
    \ 4 central trees of each control area.\nThe DSS-managed automatic irrigation\
    \ system was established in Zone 3. This had the most\nunfavorable conditions\
    \ for the hedgerow olive grove and corresponded to places with medium or high\n\
    vigor and low ECa values. In this zone, three control points were selected CR1,\
    \ CR2, CR3 (2016 and\n2017) (Figure 1) and in 2017 one more control point, CR4\
    \ (Figure 1), was added to check the system in\ndiﬀerent soil and crop conditions\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 2526\n5 of 23\nZones 1 and 2 were used to compare the irrigation\
    \ scheduling carried out in Zone 3. These two\nﬁrst zones were irrigated according\
    \ to the expert technical criteria. In both zones, two sampling points\nwere selected,\
    \ in Zone 1 (T1) points 1 and 2, and in Zone 2 (T2) points 3 and 4 (Figure 1).\
    \ At these\npoints, irrigation volumes were recorded daily using digital water\
    \ meters (CZ2000-3M, Contazara,\nZaragoza, Spain).\nFigure 1. (a) Map of soil\
    \ apparent electrical conductivity (EC) measured with a Dualem-1S sensor.\nHigh\
    \ EC values are between 15–20 (mS/m), medium values between 10–15 (mS/m) and low\

    2015 at the diﬀerent control points whose coordinates were determined using a\
    \ Mesa-Geode positioning\nsystem (Juniper Systems, Logan, UT, USA) at two depths:\
    \ at 0.0–0.30 m and at 0.30–0.60 m. All soil\nsamples were transported to the\
    \ lab in plastic bags and were air-dried, ground, and passed through a\n2 mm sieve.\
    \ The soil was characterized in terms of texture, pH and organic matter (OM).\
    \ Soil texture\nwas determined by mechanical analysis with the hydrometer method\
    \ [41], pH was measured in a 1:2.5\n(soil: water) suspension using the potentiometric\

    \ irrigation, the DSS comprised two components: (a) sensors\ninstalled in the\
    \ ﬁeld and (b) IRRIX, a web platform whose algorithm is based on a combination\
    \ of the\nwater balance with soil moisture sensor feedback adjustment mechanisms.\n\
    (a)\nSensors installed in the ﬁeld: to monitor the soil moisture, 10 HS capacitive\
    \ moisture sensors\n(Decagon Devices Inc., Pullman, WA, USA) were installed at\
    \ diﬀerent positions (position A\nand position B) (Figure 2) in the diﬀerent control\
    \ points selected (CR1, CR2, CR3 and CR4).\nTwo drippers were monitored at each\
    \ control point. Four moisture sensors were placed under\neach dripper in the\
    \ position A, two at a depth of 0.30 m and the others at a depth of 0.60 m.\n\
    In addition, one measure sensor was situated between the two drippers in the position\
    \ B at a\ndepth of 0.30 m (Figure 2). These 5 moisture sensors were installed\
    \ in each of the control points\n(CR1, CR2 and CR3) in 2016, making a total of\
    \ 15 sensors. In 2017, the number of soil moisture\nsensors was increased from\
    \ 15 to 20, as a new control point was added (CR4). When an error was\ndetected\
    \ in any of the sensors that had been installed, that sensor was automatically\
    \ replaced\nwith another in the same position.\nSensors 2020, 20, 2526\n7 of 23\n\
    Figure 2. Sensor location.\nA solenoid valve (Rain Bird Europe SCN, Aix-en-Provence,\
    \ France) and pulse water meter\n(Lab-Ferrer S.L., Cervera, Lleida, Spain) were\
    \ also installed at each control point to measure and\nmonitor each irrigation\
    \ event. An air temperature sensor (CS2015, Campbell Scientiﬁc Inc., Logan,\n\
    UT, USA) was also installed in a central point of the zone. All sensors were connected\
    \ to a datalogger\n(CR1000, Campbell Scientiﬁc Inc., Logan, UT, USA) via cables.\
    \ In addition, a voltage regulator\n(BlueSolar PWM-Pro, Vitron Energy BluePower,\
    \ The Netherlands) and a relay module (SMD-CD16AC,\nCampbell Scientiﬁc Inc., Logan,\
    \ UT, USA) were also connected to the datalogger to control the\nopening and closing\
    \ of the solenoid valves according to the programming established by the system.\n\
    The program used in the datalogger was written in CR Basic (Campbell Scientiﬁc\
    \ Inc., Logan, UT,\nUSA) and implemented the functionalities of an irrigation\
    \ automata. All data were stored each 5 min.\nThe data was downloaded to an IRRIX\
    \ server four times a day.\nThe distance between the diﬀerent control points for\
    \ automatic irrigation was limited by the\nmaximum possible cable distance to\
    \ maintain the electrical signal with suﬃcient quality. With this\nlimitation,\
    \ it was decided to locate the control points in the same area, the most disadvantaged\
    \ one,\nwhich required more precise control of the irrigation (sandier texture\
    \ and more vigorous trees).\n(b)\nIRRIX is a cloud-hosted web platform that carries\
    \ out the following daily tasks:\n1.\nData collection of sensors installed in\
    \ the ﬁeld (Figure 3). IRRIX downloads sensor data at periodic\nintervals throughout\
    \ the day and at the user’s request.\n2.\nAnalysis of all data and calculation\
    \ of irrigation water volumes. Once a day, IRRIX analyses\nthe set of data to\
    \ determine the irrigation dose using the information provided by the moisture\n\
    sensors. To achieve this, this tool integrates an algorithm which combines a WB-based\
    \ estimation\nof crop water needs (feed-forward control) with readjustment based\
    \ on sensor readings (feedback\ncontrol). [25,28,44]\n3.\nIrrigation scheduling.\
    \ IRRIX sends the updated irrigation doses to the datalogger. Then, this\ndevice\
    \ orders the activation of the rest of the equipment (solenoid valve or pumps,\
    \ etc.) to apply\nthe required irrigation doses.\n4.\nInteraction with users.\
    \ IRRIX is an autonomous system whose main objective is to free the user\nfrom\
    \ work. The main function of the user is to check that the system has worked correctly.\n\
    Logically, if there is any anomaly in the system it has to be resolved by the\
    \ user.\nSensors 2020, 20, 2526\n8 of 23\nFigure 3. Tasks carried out by IRRIX.\n\
    Before starting the irrigation campaign, the user must input to IRRIX a plan that\
    \ provides a rough\nestimation of how the water will be distributed throughout\
    \ the campaign. This seasonal plan is drawn\nup by an expert who determines the\
    \ guidelines that the irrigation must follow, in this case taking into\naccount\
    \ the deﬁcit periods. This plan represents the cumulative irrigation water amount\
    \ throughout\nthe campaign. In order to adapt to the conditions of each year,\
    \ upper and lower limits are set to this\nbaseline. For this, a set of curves\
    \ has to be deﬁned, with the automated control system positioned\nbetween those\
    \ curves in such a way that the system must be between a maximum and a minimum\n\
    cumulative irrigation value.\n2.4. Irrigation Scheduling\nThe irrigation carried\
    \ out on the plot in the diﬀerent years was the following:\n•\nIn 2015, all the\
    \ plot zones were irrigated according to the criteria of the farmer.\n•\nIn 2016,\
    \ all the plot zones were irrigated according to expert technical criteria [45].\
    \ In the T1 and\nT2 zones, the irrigation scheduling was under human control (non-automatic\
    \ irrigation scheduling,\nNAIS). Irrigation was controlled by solenoid valves\
    \ operated by a commercial automaton, Agronic\n4000 (Sistemes Electrònics Progrés,\
    \ Palau d’Anglesola, Lleida, Spain), which was programmed\nremotely, every Monday,\
    \ using the desktop application provided by the manufacturer. The CR1,\nCR2 and\
    \ CR3 control points were irrigated automatically through the IRRIX system (automatic\n\
    irrigation scheduling, AIS), without human intervention. The scheduled irrigation\
    \ dose was\nindependent at each control point. The irrigation criterion was the\
    \ same in both cases: a light RDI\nto preserve oil yield.\nIrrigation scheduling\
    \ was adjusted according to measurements of midday stem water potential\n(Ψstem)\
    \ made in T1 and T2:\n#\nPhase I, from sprouting (early in March) until the beginning\
    \ of the olive pit hardening stage\n(beginning of July) [45]. The threshold established\
    \ for Phase I was −1.4 MPa [12], which means\nthe implementation of only a slight\
    \ water deﬁcit.\n#\nPhase II, from the beginning of the hardening of olive pit\
    \ until the beginning of veraison\n(mid-September) [45]. The threshold established\
    \ for Phase II was −2.0 MPa [12].\nSensors 2020, 20, 2526\n9 of 23\n#\nPhase III,\
    \ from the end of Phase II until harvest [45]. The threshold established for Phase\
    \ III was\n−1.6 MPa [12].\nFor T1 and T2, the ETo was calculated according to\
    \ the formula of Penman and Monteith [14],\nmodiﬁed using the data obtained through\
    \ an external meteorological network (REDAREX, http:\n//redarexplus.gobex.es),\
    \ and weekly Ψstem measurements were used to adjust irrigation.\nIn the case of\
    \ CR1, CR2 and CR3, the ETo was estimated daily from the air temperature sensor\n\
    using the Hargreaves equation [46] and Ψstem values were not used to adjust irrigation.\
    \ To carry out\nirrigation at these points through the DSS, the olive irrigation\
    \ expert [45] provided a modiﬁed Kc (Kc\nmod.) that took into account the deﬁcit\
    \ irrigation strategy. This Kc mod., which has to be introduced\ninto IRRIX at\
    \ the beginning of the irrigation campaign (Figure 4) for the preparation of the\
    \ seasonal\nplan, was established on the basis of technical experience in the\
    \ same plot with a view to attaining the\ntarget Ψstem for each of the previously\
    \ described phases. At the CR1, CR2 and CR3 points, irrigation\nscheduling was\
    \ carried out independently and aimed to simulate the irrigation that was carried\
    \ out in\nT1 and T2.\n•\nIn 2017, irrigation scheduling was similar to that of\
    \ the previous year, but one more control\npoint was added (CR4) where automatic\
    \ irrigation was also carried out. As in the other CR\npoints, the CR4 irrigation\
    \ scheduling was carried out independently. The CR1 and CR2 automatic\nirrigation\
    \ scheduling was carried out in the DSS on the basis of the information provided\
    \ by\nthe sensors located in CR2. In accordance with the evolution of Ψstem, a\
    \ series of adjustments\nwere made in 2017 in relation to the seasonal plan (due\
    \ to the fact that this year was unusually\ndry) and the soil comfort zone in\
    \ relation to the sensor readings. This soil comfort zone speciﬁes\nto the control\
    \ system the acceptable range for the soil moisture sensor measurements and their\n\
    pre-established boundaries were empirically readjusted to ﬁt with the observed\
    \ range.\nFigure 4. Crop coeﬃcient (Kc) values according to the physiological\
    \ state of the olive grove. Kc was\nadjusted to the crop conditions of Extremadura\
    \ and was calculated with the Orgaz et al. [47] method\nusing the 10-year average,\
    \ and Kc mod. was adapted to the deﬁcit irrigation strategy.\nA summary of the\
    \ irrigation scheduling followed in this study is shown in Table 2.\nTable 2.\

    \ Canopy Volume\nThe Ψstem was measured once a week with a pressure chamber (Model\
    \ 3005, Soil Moisture\nEquipment Corp., Santa Barbara, CA, USA). One shaded-leaf\
    \ per tree was selected near the base of the\ntrunk and covered with aluminum\
    \ foil at least two hours before the measurements [48]. This selection\nwas carried\
    \ out between 12:00 and 13:00 h solar time. Determinations were made in four trees\
    \ per\ncontrol point. The average Ψstem value was used to calculate the irrigation\
    \ correction in T1 and T2.\nThis average was compared with the threshold value\
    \ and the deviation was calculated.\n2.5.2. Yield Data and Oil Content\nIn 2015,\
    \ yield measurements were made for the T1, T2, CR1, CR2 and CR3 sampling points.\n\
    The yield control points were increased by one (CR4) in 2017. At each control\
    \ point, 4 olive trees were\nhand harvested when the trees reached a maturity\
    \ index (MI) of approximately 2.5. A weekly sampling\nwas carried out in every\
    \ control point from the beginning of veraison. On each occasion, a sample of\n\
    one hundred olives was classiﬁed in eight color groups, and the MI was calculated\
    \ according to the\nprocedure described in [49]. The yield of each tree was weighed\
    \ separately, and subsamples of 100 olive\nfruits from the total harvest of the\
    \ four trees were collected to determine the average weight of the fruit\nand\
    \ the number of fruits per tree. All subsamples were weighed fresh. Oil content\
    \ was measured for a\n1 kg sample of the four trees by Soxhlet extraction in accordance\
    \ with EEC Regulation 2568/1991 [50].\nFor this, the sample was crushed and dried\
    \ in a DryBig 250 oven (Borel Fours Industriels and Etuves,\nS.A., Neuchâtel,\
    \ Switzerland) at 105 ◦C. In this study, the trees were harvested in late October\
    \ and\nearly November.\n2.6. Statistical Analysis\nAn analysis of variance (ANOVA)\
    \ was used for the statistical analysis of the data. When signiﬁcant\ndiﬀerences\
    \ were detected, a comparison of means was made applying Duncan’s test at p <\
    \ 0.05.\nThe statistical package IBM SPSS version 24.0 for Windows (IBM Corp.\
    \ Armonk, NY, USA) was used.\n3. Results and Discussion\n3.1. Climatic Conditions\n\
    Table 3 shows the mean temperature (Tmean) and mean relative humidity of the air\
    \ (RHmean)\nfor each of the three phases in the three study years as well as the\
    \ annual mean values, and the\ncumulative rainfall, ETc and ETo (calculated using\
    \ the Penman–Monteith (ETo-PM) and Hargreaves\n(ETo-H) methods) values for each\
    \ of the three phases in the three study years as well as the annual\ncumulative\
    \ values. The highest Tmean and lowest RHmean values were observed in 2017. The\
    \ highest\nTmean values were reached in Phase II (summer months) in all years,\
    \ and the lowest in Phase III in\n2015 and 2017 and in Phase I in 2016. Cumulative\
    \ rainfall in the experimental period amounted to\n181 mm in 2015, 152 mm in 2016\
    \ and 76 mm in 2017. Annual cumulative rainfall ranged from 475 mm\n(2016), the\
    \ rainiest year, to 265 mm (2017), the driest year as well as the year with the\
    \ highest annual\nETo values. The annual ETo-PM was very similar in the three\
    \ years of study, with higher values in\nPhase I. The ETo-H followed the same\
    \ seasonal trend as ETo-PM, although with slightly higher values.\nThe ETo-H overestimated\
    \ the ETo-PM by 7% on average. The annual ETc was 834 mm, 861 mm and\n894 mm for\
    \ 2015, 2016 and 2017, respectively.\nSensors 2020, 20, 2526\n11 of 23\nTable\

    \ Water\nTable 4 shows the irrigation amounts supplied in each phase in the three\
    \ study years. It should be\nnoted that 2017 was unusually dry, and so the amount\
    \ of applied irrigation water was higher due to\nthe low rainfall and high ETo.\
    \ Comparing the diﬀerent control points in each zone, it is possible to\nobserve\
    \ how in 2015 the irrigation applied was very similar in all cases for each Phase\
    \ and in total.\nIn 2016, the AIS zones received less water than T1 and T2, mainly\
    \ in Phase II with 16% less, with a\nconsequent total water saving of 24%. It\
    \ should be noted that at sampling point 4 (in T2) there was an\nirrigation system\
    \ failure during Phase II and, therefore, the water applied in that phase was\
    \ lower\nthan for points 1, 2 and 3 in T1 and T2. In 2017, AIS applied more water\
    \ in Phase I in CR1, CR2 and\nCR3 points and less water in Phases II and III than\
    \ the amounts applied at the T1, T2, T3 and T4 points.\nIt is observed that the\
    \ AIS emulates the expert scheduling and obtained a 6% reduction in applied\n\
    water compared to the NAIS system. The DSS schedules irrigation independently\
    \ at each of the points\nin accordance with the particular conditions that exist\
    \ in each zone.\nThe ability of the automatic system to respond diﬀerently in\
    \ each of the control points may,\ntherefore, respond to diﬀerences in soil water\
    \ reserves which depend on soil texture and crop water\ndemand at each particular\
    \ point. This information is provided continuously by the frequency domain\nreﬂectometry\
    \ (FDR) sensors. However, the greater or lesser presence of roots in the area\
    \ where the\nsensors are located also needs to be taken into account. In addition,\
    \ it is important to consider the\nsize of the roots as this can aﬀect the readings\
    \ of the FDR sensors, with an increase in root system size\nresulting in increasingly\
    \ larger underestimations of the true volumetric water content, presumably\nbecause\
    \ of the water in the roots [51]. With regard to the (rain + irrigation)/crop\
    \ evapotranspiration\nrelationship (Table 4), the crop received less water in\
    \ relation to its needs in 2015, when irrigation was\ncarried out at the farmer’s\
    \ discretion.\nFigure 5 shows cumulative irrigation at the NASI and AIS points\
    \ in 2016 and 2017. The irrigation\namount was lower in 2016 than in 2017, as\
    \ 2017 was a drier year. In 2016, the water applied until early\nJuly was very\
    \ similar in all points but, after this date, more water began to be applied at\
    \ T1 and less\nwater at CR1. In 2017, the irrigation season started a month earlier\
    \ and the initial irrigations diﬀered at\nthe diﬀerent points until converging\
    \ in August. From that date onwards, more water was applied at\nCR3 than the rest\
    \ of the points until the end of the irrigation campaign. As water volumes were\
    \ higher\nin 2017, the maximum and minimum limits are also higher as they were\
    \ established as percentages\nof the campaign schedule. The irrigation pattern\
    \ was diﬀerent at each CR point, with the greatest\nSensors 2020, 20, 2526\n12\
    \ of 23\ndiﬀerences observed in Phase II in the case of CR1, CR2 and CR3. In the\
    \ case of CR4, the pattern was\ndiﬀerent from the rest: more water was applied\
    \ in Phase II and less in Phase III. In summary, the water\napplied generally\
    \ followed the same pattern in the diﬀerent control points in 2016, while in 2017\
    \ there\nwas a change in trend during Phase II.\nTable 4. Irrigation supplied\

    \ Soil Water Content\nWith respect to soil water content, Table 5 speciﬁes the\
    \ high and low reference values of each of\nthe moisture sensors during the years\
    \ 2016 and 2017. IRRIX establishes two parameters for each sensor:\na high reference\
    \ (ﬁeld capacity, FC) and a low reference (in deﬁcit irrigation conditions). The\
    \ high\nreference represents the value recorded by that sensor under soil FC conditions,\
    \ and this value can\nbe obtained out of season after rain. The low reference\
    \ is determined for each sensor at the driest\nvalue recorded every day. A more\
    \ detailed description can be found in Millán et al. [28] of how IRRIX\ndetermines\
    \ the high and low reference for each sensor. These high and low reference values\
    \ serve to\nreduce the variability between the sensors and to obtain homogeneous\
    \ reference points for the diﬀerent\nsensors. It can be seen in Table 6 that the\
    \ high reference value of each sensor was higher in 2016 than in\n2017, with the\
    \ exception of sensors 1 (S1) and 3 (S3) located in CR1 and sensor 10 (S10) in\
    \ CR2. As for\nthe low reference, the values are lower in 2016 than in 2017 except\
    \ for the sensors that are located\nin position A at 0.60 m in CR1 and CR2 and\
    \ sensor 12 (S12) in CR3. The references established for\neach sensor changed\
    \ every year, as IRRIX is a dynamic system that adapts to the conditions of each\n\
    campaign and even to changes during the campaign itself.\nTable 5. High and low\

    \ conditions of deﬁcit irrigation. The high and low\nreference values of each\
    \ of the sensors correspond to the beginning of the irrigation campaign in the\
    \ diﬀerent years.\nThe temporal evolution of soil water content (SWC) is presented\
    \ in Figure 6 for control point\nCR2 in 2017. With respect to the position under\
    \ dripper (A) at 0.3 m depth (Figure 6a,b), the sensors\nfollowed the same overall\
    \ pattern. These sensors are very sensitive to irrigation, responding quickly\n\
    even to low volumes of rain or irrigation. Furthermore, these sensors had a very\
    \ marked response\namplitude between minimums before irrigation and maximums at\
    \ the end of irrigation. It can be seen\nin Figure 6b that, in Phase II, sensor\
    \ 8 (S8) presented a diﬀerent behavior to sensor 6 (S6) (Figure 6a),\nas the S8\
    \ responded to applied irrigation during a certain period of time. This result\
    \ may be attributable\nto the place where the emitter was located because of the\
    \ spatial variability of the moisture distribution\nin the soil.\nProbes located\
    \ at 0.6 m depth (Figure 6c,d) showed less diﬀerence between the maximum and\n\
    minimum and also responded quickly to small amounts of rain as did the probes\
    \ located at 0.3 m.\nThe two sensors (S7 and S9) showed diﬀerent behavior throughout\
    \ the study period. Normally, sensors\ninstalled in the same position follow the\
    \ same pattern but, as sometimes these sensors show a totally\ndiﬀerent behavior,\
    \ consideration needs to be given to sensor-to-sensor variability. This variability\
    \ is\ngreater in the case of localized irrigation, since wet bulbs are formed\
    \ around the emitters while the rest\nof the soil may be only slightly aﬀected\
    \ or not at all by the irrigation. Due to the existence of spatial\nvariability,\
    \ sensor variability can be aggravated in the case of woody crops since the moisture\
    \ sensors\nneed to be installed in the area of the bulb where there may be more\
    \ roots [25,28]. Kang et al. [51]\nindicated that the size of the root can aﬀect\
    \ the readings of FDR sensors. A careful interpretation is\ntherefore required\
    \ when FDR sensors are used to determine soil moisture content. Sensor variability\n\
    can also be due to changes that occur in the dielectric properties of the soil\
    \ [52] or other soil properties,\nespecially bulk density and the existence of\
    \ macropores.\nThe sensors installed in position A at 0.3 m depth presented a\
    \ range of very diﬀerent measurements.\nFor example, the S6 had maximum values\
    \ of 0.447 m3/m3 with a measurement range (the measurement\nrange is the sensor\
    \ reading at the beginning and end of the irrigation season) of about 0.371 to\n\
    0.389 m3/m3 while the S8 presented maximum values of 0.385 m3/m3 with a measurement\
    \ range of\n0.331 to 0.334 m3/m3. At 0.6 m depth, the measurement ranges between\
    \ sensors located under the same\nposition also varied considerably. The S7 had\
    \ maximum values of 0.419 m3/m3 with a measurement\nrange of about 0.309 to 0.338\
    \ m3/m3 and the S9 presented maximum values of 0.394 m3/m3 with a\nmeasurement\
    \ range of 0.213 to 0.307 m3/m3. It must be considered that as sensor depth increases\
    \ the\npresence of water in the lower layers is greater, which may be due to the\
    \ arrival of water from other\npoints. In addition, soil moisture ﬂuctuations\
    \ decreased with depth. Mittelbach et al. [53] established\nthat 10HS sensors\
    \ do not capture the daily soil moisture content ﬂuctuations for moist conditions\
    \ and\nthat soil moisture ﬂuctuations are almost negligible at 0.25 m depth and\
    \ below.\nIn the position between drippers (B) at 0.30 m depth (Figure 6e), the\
    \ sensors responded to low\napplications of rain or irrigation. It can be seen\
    \ how sensor 10 (S10) was sensitive to small irrigation\namounts and showed a\
    \ greater amplitude between the maximum and minimum during the study\nSensors\
    \ 2020, 20, 2526\n15 of 23\nperiod. In the case of S10, the values of the measurements\
    \ of the 10HS probes did not surpass\n0.371 m3/m3. This may mainly be due to the\
    \ creation of preferential channels in the soil and, because\nof this, the water\
    \ from one or more drippers moving to the place where the sensor is located.\n\
    It should be noted that Phase I corresponds to a period of mild stress, and a\
    \ slight decrease in the\namount of water in the soil is observed in Figure 6a,c,d\
    \ and a more pronounced decrease in Figure 6b.\nIn Phase II there is a clear decrease\
    \ in SWC in Figure 6a–d. In Phase III there is a delay in the response\nto the\
    \ increase in irrigation that coincides with the onset of rainfall.\nTable 6.\

    \ and Productivity\nFigure 7 shows the Ψstem evolution in 2015 (Figure 7a), 2016\
    \ (Figure 7b) and 2017 (Figure 7c) for\nall control points. A declining trend\
    \ of Ψstem can be seen in Phases I and II as the irrigation season\nadvanced,\
    \ followed by an increase in Phase III to the end of the irrigation campaign.\
    \ In 2015 (Figure 7a),\nwhen all the areas were irrigated according to the farmer’s\
    \ criteria, there was a marked diﬀerence in\nΨstem at the diﬀerent control points.\
    \ At all points, Ψstem was above the reference threshold value in\nall three phases\
    \ (shown by a horizontal dotted line in all the ﬁgures), except in zone T2 which\
    \ fell\nbelow it on several days in Phase II. The highest values, recorded in\
    \ Phase I at the beginning of spring,\nwere around −0.66 MPa, −0.87 MPa, −0.79\
    \ MPa, −0.70 MPa and −0.57 MPa for T1, T2, CR1, CR2 and\nCR3, respectively. The\
    \ minimum Ψstem was at mid-summer in Phase II with average values of −1.67,\n\
    −2.43 MPa, −1.12 MPa, −1.22 MPa and −1.67 MPa in T1, T2, CR1, CR2 and CR3, respectively.\n\
    In 2016 (Figure 7b), when introducing the expert criteria for irrigation scheduling,\
    \ the differences\nin water status between the different control points throughout\
    \ the entire irrigation season decreased,\nbut especially in Phase II. Higher\
    \ Ψstem values were obtained in CR1 and CR2 than the other control\npoints throughout\
    \ the irrigation season, while CR3 presented the lowest Ψstem values of around\
    \ −2.36 and\n−2.69 MPa reaching the pre-established threshold in Phase II and\
    \ Phase III, respectively. T1 and T2 also\nremained above the pre-established\
    \ limits throughout the irrigation season, except for the days on\nwhich CR3 remained\
    \ below the pre-established limits in Phase II and Phase III, because there was\
    \ an\nirrigation failure.\nIn 2017, the AIS achieved a greater adjustment at CR1\
    \ and CR2 to the Ψstem targets. CR4 had\na similar evolution of Ψstem to the other\
    \ control points. Greater homogeneity in crop water status\nbetween the diﬀerent\
    \ points was achieved in 2017 than in 2016.\nThe Ψstem values where AIS was carried\
    \ out followed the same pattern as the Ψstem values in\nT1 and T2 (NAIS) in 2016\
    \ and 2017, despite the application of diﬀerent irrigation volumes, due to\ndosage\
    \ readjustment made by the IRRIX system with the information provided by the soil\
    \ probes.\nThe typical spring rainfall and the accumulation of water reserves\
    \ in the soil during autumn and winter\ncan make it diﬃcult to induce water stress,\
    \ and the Ψstem values can sometimes exceed the proposed\nthresholds during the\
    \ irrigation season [13,54–60]. In addition, the algorithm used in the areas where\n\
    irrigation was carried out automatically showed a good response to the RDI strategies.\
    \ While some\nresearchers have previously worked with a web platform whose algorithm\
    \ results from a combination\nof the water balance with feedback from soil moisture\
    \ sensors to perform automatic irrigation [24–26],\nthis is the ﬁrst time that\
    \ the algorithms used to establish the automated irrigation have been shown to\n\
    respond well to RDI in an olive grove, maintaining the water status of the plant.\n\

    \ day of the year.\nThe results for yield, number of fruits per tree, oil yield\
    \ and water productivity (WP) for olives\nand for oil are presented in Table 6.\
    \ In 2015, signiﬁcant diﬀerences between diﬀerent control points\nwere found in\
    \ yield, number of fruits per tree, oil yield and WP, with CR2 the least productive\
    \ and\nwith signiﬁcant diﬀerences with T2. In 2016, CR1 and CR3 showed no signiﬁcant\
    \ diﬀerences in yield\nwith respect to irrigation carried out with expert supervision.\
    \ However, CR2 had lower yield, number\nof fruits per tree, oil yield, WP yield\
    \ and WP oil yield than the other control points, which could be\ndue to alternation\
    \ in crop yield between more and less productive years as is common in this cultivar.\n\
    With regard to 2017, yield increased in all control points, with CR2 the most\
    \ productive. In addition,\nthe WP yield and the WP oil yield also increased notably\
    \ compared to the previous two years, with\n52 kg of olives and about 8.5 kg of\
    \ oil produced per cubic meter of water provided in CR2. This can be\nattributed\
    \ to the lower crop load level in CR2 in 2015 and 2016. The number of fruits per\
    \ tree also\nincreased with respect to previous years, being signiﬁcantly higher\
    \ in CR1 and CR2. No statistically\nsigniﬁcant diﬀerences were found in oil yield\
    \ at the diﬀerent control points.\nSensors 2020, 20, 2526\n19 of 23\nIntroducing\
    \ the strategy recommended by the expert led to an increase in yield and a tendency\
    \ to\nploy homogenization in 2017, especially with respect to oil production which\
    \ showed no statistically\nsigniﬁcant diﬀerences between the various control points.\
    \ Moriana et al. [12] previously demonstrated\nthat the RDI strategy used in this\
    \ experiment and for this crop presented signiﬁcant diﬀerences in yield\nor oil\
    \ yield with respect to a control treatment in which the trees were irrigated\
    \ with 100% ETc.\nThe heterogeneity of a commercial plot irrigated with the same\
    \ criteria causes diﬀerences between\nthe various plants on the plot. By characterizing\
    \ this variability and considering these diﬀerences for\nirrigation scheduling,\
    \ the use of RDI strategies has been shown to lead to greater plot homogenization.\n\
    This is of great importance for the use of automated irrigation systems where\
    \ the selection of the control\nzone(s) that will govern decision making is important.\
    \ Automatic irrigation has been shown to be\ncapable of simulating expert judgement\
    \ in the application of RDI strategies based on crop water status.\nThe system\
    \ improved its performance after the ﬁrst year of adjustment. Recent studies have\
    \ reported\nthat RDI strategies can be advantageous in SHD olive orchards in terms\
    \ of reducing water applications,\ndecreasing excessive tree vigor, improving\
    \ irradiance environments and increasing yield, oil quality\nand water-use eﬃciency\
    \ [1,6,61–63]. The results of the present study provide evidence that an RDI\n\
    strategy can be applied through a DSS in a plot of SHD olive orchards with no\
    \ negative eﬀects on yield,\nnumber of fruits per tree, oil yield, WP yield or\
    \ WP oil yield, if there is prior spatial characterization\nand pre-established\
    \ criteria for decision making. Characterization of the spatial variability of\
    \ the plot\nis very important in the case of a hedgerow olive grove, since an\
    \ area with greater vigor is not always\nrelated to higher productivity [40].\
    \ In addition, a better irrigation management in an area with lower\nwater retention\
    \ capacity (sandy soil) allows more balanced vegetative growth, which is necessary\
    \ for\nhedgerow olive grove productivity [64]. Phase II is considered the most\
    \ important for an automatic\nirrigation system, and adjustment of the deﬁcit\
    \ irrigation dosages determined by a ﬁeld expert can be\nbetter controlled by\
    \ an automatic system analyzing crop water needs and soil moisture. During this\n\
    phase, plant water status can be better controlled in more unfavorable zones,\
    \ enabling all ﬁeld zones to\nenjoy the correct water status.\n4. Conclusions\n\
    This work aimed to evaluate and develop an automated irrigation protocol in a\
    \ hedgerow\nolive orchard using the IRRIX platform. In this case, the device had\
    \ to simulate a recommended\nirrigation strategy for this type of plantation that\
    \ included the use of regulated deﬁcit irrigation.\nThe characterization of the\
    \ spatial variability was useful to locate the control points.\nThe automatic\
    \ irrigation scheduling simulated the expert criterion, adapting to the speciﬁc\n\
    conditions of the control point where the soil sensors were installed. The total\
    \ amount of manually\nand automatically applied irrigation water was similar at\
    \ the various control points, but not its\ndistribution as the DSS estimated the\
    \ water needs by combining the water balance method with a\nfeedback mechanism\
    \ based on the moisture sensor readings. In addition, the DSS was able to establish\n\
    an RDI strategy which induced moderate-to-severe stress during Phase II of the\
    \ crop in the parts of the\nplot with the most unfavorable conditions for the\
    \ hedgerow (places with high vigor and low ECa).\nThe adoption of an appropriate\
    \ RDI strategy in an SHD olive grove enabled homogenization of plot\nyield, with\
    \ a tendency to increase production. The automatic irrigation allowed irrigation\
    \ management\nwith minimum human intervention.\nThe results obtained with the\
    \ system improved in the third year, when adjustments were made\nbased on the\
    \ information collected in the previous year. The automated irrigation has proven\
    \ to be\nable to adapt to the particular conditions of the place where it is installed\
    \ and to the diﬀerent growth\nstages of the crop, thus improving the key eﬃciency\
    \ parameters.\nAutomatic irrigation scheduling is of particular interest in the\
    \ case of olive groves. In this\ncrop, monitoring stem water potentials at commercial\
    \ level for crop phase dosage readjustment is\ncomplicated by the strongly negative\
    \ values that can be attained but which cannot be measured with a\npump-up pressure\
    \ chamber.\nSensors 2020, 20, 2526\n20 of 23\nAlthough the results were encouraging,\
    \ further studies are required to improve certain aspects of\nthe system, particularly\
    \ relating to the integration of the NDVI and ECa measurements into the DSS.\n\

    systems. A review

    Abstract Global warming and price volatility are increasing

    uncertainty for the future of agriculture. Therefore, agricultur-

    al systems must be sustainable not only under average condi-

    tions, but also under extreme changes of productivity, econo-

    my, environment and social context. Here, we review four

    concepts: stability, robustness, vulnerability and resilience.

    Those concepts are commonly used but are sometimes diffi-

    cult to distinguish due to the lack of clear boundaries. Here,

    we clarify the role of these concepts in addressing agronomic

    issues. Our main findings are as follows: (1) agricultural sys-

    tems face different types of perturbations, from small and

    usual perturbations to extreme and unpredictable changes;

    (2) stability, robustness, vulnerability and resilience have been

    increasingly applied to analyze the agricultural context in or-

    der to predict the system response under changing conditions;

    (3) the four concepts are distinguished by the nature of the

    system components and by the type of perturbation studied;

    (4) assessment methods must be tested under contrasted situ-

    ations; and (5) the major options allowing system adaptation

    under extreme and unpredictable changes are the increase of

    diversity and the increase of the adaptive capacity.

    1 Introduction

    Farming activities are regularly exposed to unpredictable

    perturbations, i.e. changes in environmental or socio-

    economic constraints which cannot be anticipated. Facing

    uncertainties, farmers have to deal not only with urgent

    and short-term tactical issues (e.g. protecting a crop from

    pests or taking advantage of sowing opportunities) but also

    with more strategic decisions driven by their medium- to

    long-term objectives (Rodriguez et al. 2011). In general,

    the predominant approach to mitigate the impacts of exoge-

    nous changes on cropping and livestock systems is based on

    controlling environmental conditions (ten Napel et al. 2006).

    Modern intensive farming, which relies heavily on pesti-

    cides, antibiotics, mineral fertilizers and irrigation in order

    to control system conditions, has proven to be a successful

    approach to maximize productivity per production unit and

    increase agricultural production in the world. The most il-

    lustrative example of this approach is greenhouse production

    where fruits and vegetables are grown in a highly standard-

    ized and controlled environment. Nevertheless, evidence of

    drawbacks of this approach is accumulating: despite a strong

    artificialization of agricultural landscapes and intensive use

    of chemical inputs, crops and livestock around the world are

    still exposed to various types of exogenous perturbations,

    such as outbreaks of infectious diseases in animal production

    and development of pest and pathogen resistances to pesti-

    cides in crop production. Moreover, negative environmental

    impacts of intensive farming systems are evident, such as air

    and water pollution and loss of biodiversity (Millennium

    Ecosystem Assessment 2005).

    In recent years, social and political pressure for more sus-

    tainable agricultural systems showed up the need for

    implementing more sustainable production systems and led

    to the emergence of various methods and indicators to quan-

    tify the sustainability of farming activities. These methods

    generally include economic, environmental and societal pil-

    lars and are usually based on multicriteria approaches address-

    ing these different issues (Bockstaller et al. 2009). However,

    these methods are generally focused on the assessment of

    average agricultural outputs (i.e. under conditions that are

    considered as “normal”) and do not consider performance

    changes in time and space, particularly when exogenous per-

    turbations occur. Thus, scientists and stakeholders are current-

    ly reconsidering agricultural system design in order to better

    take into account the variability of environmental conditions

    (Naylor 2008). As part of this new vision, changes and adap-

    tations are recognized as essential elements: the ability to con-

    tinue to achieve goals despite the occurrence of perturbations

    is becoming a central issue in the assessment of agricultural

    sustainability (Tendall et al. 2015). This concern is generally

    expressed through a paradigm shift, from maximizing average

    productivity in a stable environment towards reducing

    performance changes in an environment subject to greater

    variation (Milestad et al. 2012). However, this transition re-

    quires new knowledge and expertise to characterize and assess

    the ability of agricultural systems to maintain high levels of

    agricultural outputs in a non-stable environment (Fig. 1).

    In the face of this challenge, different concepts such as

    stability, robustness, vulnerability and resilience have been

    developed in recent decades. Despite conceptualization from

    different discipline backgrounds, these four concepts all focus

    on the ability of diverse systems to maintain or recover their

    functionalities in a challenging environment. An increasing

    number of review articles illustrate the growing interest of

    scientists from different disciplines in these concepts (see,

    for example, Mumby et al. (2014) for a review of resilience,

    robustness and vulnerability applied to marine ecosystems;

    Gallopín (2006) for a review of vulnerability and resilience

    applied to socio-ecological systems; and Mens et al. (2011) for

    a review of robustness, resilience and vulnerability applied to

    flood risk management). These concepts have also been used

    in agricultural sciences, either as equivalent terms (National

    Research Council 2010) or as concepts to be combined for a

    more comprehensive and integrative approach (Callo-Concha

    and Ewert 2014). Due to fuzzy boundaries between these four

    concepts, we have noticed the difficulty for some scientists in

    agricultural sciences in defining them correctly and under-

    standing their differences and potential uses. Furthermore, a

    clear analytical framework associated with each concept is

    still lacking and hence limits their usefulness to assess the

    ability of agricultural systems to cope with perturbations.

    In the present paper, we aim to clarify the potential of

    stability, robustness, vulnerability and resilience as opera-

    tional concepts to assess the ability of agricultural systems

    to deal with a context of increasing uncertainty. In the

    following sections, the paper will first introduce agricultural

    systems and their exposure to exogenous changes (Sect. 2).

    Then, we will review different strands of literature to define

    more clearly each concept and assess their differences and

    respective uses in agricultural sciences (Sect. 3). Based on

    recent papers, we will discuss operational methods avail-

    able to characterize and quantify the ability of agricultural

    systems to cope with various types of perturbation

    (Sect. 4). Finally, the paper will outline some key levers

    to improve the ability of agricultural systems to deal with a

    more changeable environment (Sect. 5).

    2 Agricultural systems facing a more changeable

    environment

    In order to explore the position of each concept regarding the

    assessment of agricultural performance in a variable environ-

    ment, we start by clarifying what agricultural systems are and

    what are their interactions with external drivers.

    2.1 Agricultural systems

    Agricultural systems are socio-ecological systems, compris-

    ing biotechnical and social factors, and dedicated to the pro-

    duction of productive, economic, environmental and social

    outputs (Renting et al. 2009). On the one hand, biotechnical

    factors consist of biological and technical components linked

    through feedback mechanisms (ten Napel et al. 2011).

    Biological components comprise not only domesticated plant

    and animal species but also non-domesticated species like

    pests and pollinators of crops. Technical components consist

    of engineering elements designed to optimize agricultural out-

    puts (e.g. irrigation system and decision support tools). On the

    other hand, social factors refer to farmers’ actions and atti-

    tudes and in which may be considered separately the psycho-

    logical make-up of the farmer and the characteristics of the

    farm household (Edwards-Jones 2006).

    According to this basic conceptual scheme, the agricultural

    outputs of a farm are highly influenced by the interaction

    between the different components that constitute biotechnical

    and social factors. However, agricultural systems are also em-

    bedded in larger systems such as food, institutional or social

    systems. Hence, they are also influenced by external drivers

    which can be a source of unpredictable changes for farmers.

    2.2 A more changeable environment

    External drivers of agricultural systems encompass bio-geophys-

    ical, social, economic and political environments that determine

    how agricultural activities are performed. These drivers can vary

    significantly in time and space and therefore can affect

    agricultural systems positively or negatively. Depending on the

    frequency, duration and predictability of these changes, Maxwell

    (1986) distinguished four different types of perturbations that

    affect agricultural systems: noise when perturbations occur on a

    regular basis and are usually expected by farmers, shocks when

    perturbations are unusual and difficult to anticipate, cycles when

    the variation is due to cyclical changes, and trends when the

    change is gradual over time.

    In terms of trends, global warming is expected to impact

    agricultural activities gradually in the future: by the end of the

    twenty-first century, temperature is projected to rise by 1.4 to

    5.8 °C while atmospheric CO2 concentration could reach three

    to four times the pre-industrial levels (IPCC 2014). In Europe,

    simulations of future climate have suggested an increase of

    average temperature and a slight decrease in rainfall (Trnka

    et al. 2011). Livestock systems may also be impacted by glob-

    al warming, directly by the effects of heat on animal health,

    growth and reproduction and, indirectly, for herbivores,

    through impacts on the productivity of pastures and forage

    crops (Maracchi et al. 2005). Climate change is also expected

    to increase the risk of potential pest pressure in agriculture by

    providing more suitable environmental conditions for exotic

    pests to adapt across areas which were previously detrimental

    for their survival (Lamichhane et al. 2014). In this context of

    gradual changes, farmers and researchers can partly anticipate

    the impacts on agricultural activities through mitigation and

    adaptation programs (Olesen et al. 2011; Reidsma et al. 2010).

    For example, many research and implementation projects are

    currently dealing with adaptation strategies using local knowl-

    edge and low inputs for soil protection and water management

    in the context of climate change (Meynard et al. 2012).

    Beyond average trends, agricultural systems are also ex-

    posed to less predictable perturbations, such as climatic or

    economic shocks. These perturbations, exhibiting various in-

    tensities and durations, can also heavily impact agricultural

    activities. For example, climate variability is considered to

    explain part of wheat yield stagnation in Europe since the

    middle of the 1990s (Brisson et al. 2010; Moore and Lobell

    2014), while food price volatility has negatively impacted

    farmers’ income stability in recent years (Huchet-Bourdon

    2011). In addition to these individual perturbations, local is-

    sues may also interact with global economic issues and further

    increase overall perturbations. For example, due to the speci-

    ficities of the world agricultural market (inelastic demand for

    agricultural products, high seasonality and relatively long pro-

    duction period coupled with a short shelf-life for many agri-

    cultural products), a severe climatic shock, such as drought on

    grain production in an exporting country, may have significant

    repercussions on international, national and local markets and,

    therefore, on food security and political stability on local and

    global scales (Sternberg 2012).

    Furthermore, the relationship between agricultural systems

    and their external drivers requires that the intrinsic sensitivity

    of agricultural systems to exogenous perturbations be taken

    into account. For example, the impact of market volatility

    perturbations. The impact on a sunflower field of salted sea water

    during the period 2007 to 2009 was particularly severe in

    Europe as the progressive change of CAP policies more di-

    rectly exposed farmers to commodity price volatility (Enjolras

    et al. 2014). Moreover, there is also increasing evidence that

    the trend towards specialization and homogenization of genet-

    ic diversity across agricultural landscapes (Hoisington et al.

    1999) is increasing the sensitivity of many agricultural sys-

    tems around the world to various types of perturbation. In

    cropping systems, for example, genetic and crop uniformity

    over large areas tends to amplify pest invasions and outbreaks

    (Altieri and Nicholls 2004), while in animal husbandry, re-

    gional specialization of agricultural activities can increase san-

    itary risks by facilitating the spread of animal diseases Fèvre

    et al. (2006).

    In this context and in order to get a better under-

    standing of the overall context in which agricultural

    systems are implemented, researchers have developed

    and used several concepts that deal with the response

    of agricultural systems when facing perturbations. In the

    next section, we introduce these different concepts, their

    historical backgrounds and their main differences ac-

    cording to how the relationship between agricultural

    systems and perturbations is expounded.

    3 Conceptual frameworks

    We focus on four different concepts: stability, robustness, vul-

    nerability and resilience. These four concepts are character-

    ized by having a highly multidimensional nature and have

    been used in various papers related to agricultural systems.

    At first glance, they may appear to be linked by fuzzy bound-

    aries and to be suitable in various contexts. Depending on

    authors, there is a call for more stable (Mishra and Sandretto

    2002), more robust (ten Napel et al. 2006), less vulnerable

    (Schröter et al. 2005) or more resilient (Naylor 2008) agricul-

    tural systems and sometimes a combination of all of these (de

    Goede et al. 2013; Tendall et al. 2015).

    In order to clarify the specificities of each concept and

    based upon the existing literature, we will present in this

    section their historical backgrounds and their main

    differences according to how they are used in papers related

    to agricultural systems. More precisely, each concept is

    discussed separately in order to highlight in which context it

    proved to be the most useful. As already pointed by Carpenter

    et al. (2001) concerning resilience, these multidimensional

    concepts acquire significance only if the studied object (the

    system and its boundaries), the type of output to be maintained

    and the nature of the perturbations are precisely defined. Thus,

    we will answer simple but essential questions when assessing

    each concept: what kind of system is studied, what kind of

    output is targeted and against what kind of perturbation?

    Table 1 summarizes the main elements for each concept

    and includes some examples from agricultural sciences. It

    may help readers to choose the most suitable concept accord-

    ing to the nature of their research questions.

    3.1 The concept of stability

    The word stability originates from the Latin stabilis, meaning

    to stand firm or steady. It has been widely used in several

    scientific disciplines (mathematics, engineering, economic,

    social and natural sciences) to express the ability of an object

    to maintain equilibrium. In natural sciences, the concept of

    ecological stability was first defined as the constancy of a

    given attribute, regardless of the presence of disturbing factors

    (Justus 2008). For example, stable ecological communities

    were those with relatively constant population sizes and com-

    positions (MacArthur 1955). Later, the definition of ecologi-

    cal stability has been expanded to describe other properties of

    ecosystems, such as the ability to maintain ecological func-

    tions despite disturbances (Turner et al. 1993) or the ability to

    return to the initial equilibrium state (Ives and Carpenter

    2007). This led to multiple definitions and interpretations of

    stability (Grimm and Wissel 1997) and sometimes to the feel-

    ing that it is defined in many ways depending on how scien-

    tists wish to look at the problem (Lin et al. 1986).

    In agricultural sciences, the concept of stability has been

    mainly used with the original meaning of ecological stabil-

    ity, i.e. as a criterion to measure the spatial or temporal

    constancy of specific features of agricultural systems

    (Fig. 2a). For example, the stability of genotypes has been

    widely used in plant breeding programs in order to identify

    genotypes that maintain specific features (e.g. yield or pro-

    tein content in the grain) over a wide range of environments

    (Brancourt-Hulmel 1999; Sabaghnia et al. 2012). Based on

    genotype × environment interactions, two types of stability

    are sometimes distinguished: (i) static stability which refers

    to a genotype for which variance is small between different

    environments and (ii) dynamic stability which refers to a

    genotype for which the response to various environments

    is correlated to the mean response of all genotypes in the

    trial (Annicchiarico 2002). In other terms, the first type of

    stability focuses on constancy regardless of the variability in

    system environments whereas the second type of stability

    includes these environmental differences.

    Even though analysis of yield stability has been largely

    confined to multienvironment trials for comparing spatial sta-

    bility of crop cultivars, stability analysis has also been applied

    to compare the temporal stability of different agronomic treat-

    ments in long-term experiments. For example, Berzsenyi et al.

    (2000) and Govaerts et al. (2005) implemented stability anal-

    ysis to evaluate the effect of diverse crop rotations, fertiliza-

    tion treatments or tillage management techniques on crop

    yield stability.

    15

    Agron. Sustain. Dev. (2016) 36: 15

    Considering these first elements, it appears that the

    concept of concept has been applied in agricultural stud-

    ies with a meaning relatively close to ecological con-

    stancy, i.e. as the stability of agricultural outputs in time

    or space but without explicitly referring to the external

    drivers of change and to the occurrence of perturbations.

    Moreover, the concept of stability has been mainly ap-

    plied to individual components (e.g. genotypes) or out-

    puts (e.g. yield or income) of agricultural systems rather

    than through a more integrated approach. Hence, it may

    show a low potential for describing and explaining the

    behaviour of complex agricultural systems in a context

    of unpredictable changes.

    3.2 The concept of robustness

    The word robustness comes from the Latin robustus,

    meaning strong. Widely used in statistics to refer to

    methods that are not affected by small deviations from

    model assumptions (Maronna et al. 2006), robustness also

    emerged in recent years as a major concept for analyzing

    the response of diverse objects facing perturbations.

    Industrialists and engineers first mobilized this concept in

    the early 1950s in order to optimize the manufacturing

    design of various devices and reduce their sensitivity to

    variation over which makers have little or no control

    (Taguchi and Clausing 1990). Subsequently, robustness

    theory was applied to various engineering processes, such as

    information networks, electronic circuits or flight control sys-

    tems, in airplanes in order to make them capable of operating

    under a wide range of constraints (Fowlkes et al. 1995).

    More recently, the concept of robustness has also been used

    by biologists to describe the ability of living systems to main-

    tain specific functionalities despite unpredictable environmen-

    tal or genetic perturbations (Kitano 2004). For example, bio-

    logical robustness can be illustrated by the ability of genomes

    to compensate for the loss of function in one gene by means of

    other copies of this gene (Gu et al. 2003). Based on these

    observations from engineering and biological sciences, ro-

    bustness has been described as an intrinsic property of com-

    plex adaptive systems (Carlson and Doyle 2002) and as an

    important trait for the species’ capacity to evolve through

    natural selection (Wagner 2008).

    Comprising both technical and biological domains, agricul-

    tural systems can also be defined as complex and adaptive

    systems. Hence, the robustness concept was recently intro-

    duced into agricultural sciences and has been used in an in-

    creasing number of scientific papers to represent the complex

    interactions between the biotechnical factors of agricultural

    systems and external drivers of change (de Goede et al.

    2013; ten Napel et al. 2006; Verhagen et al. 2010). In these

    papers, robustness has been mainly defined as the ability to

    minimize the variability of specific agricultural outputs despite

    the occurrence of explicitly defined perturbations (Fig. 2b).

    A large part of the literature recently devoted to this subject

    deals with robustness as a key breeding goal for animal farms

    (Knap 2005; Sauvant and Martin 2010; Star et al. 2008). The

    aim is to select animals that achieve a high production level in a

    wide diversity of environmental conditions, including stressful

    conditions. These stressors can be disease challenges, extreme

    temperatures, low-quality feed or challenges due to changes in

    housing or management (Merks et al. 2012). However, robust-

    ness has also been discussed in the context of cropping systems

    exposed to climatic or biotic perturbations. For example,

    Sabatier et al. (2013) compared the robustness of two contrast-

    ing types of management strategies for a cacao agroecosystem

    in Indonesia facing pest outbreaks and pesticide changes.

    Applied to agricultural systems facing an environment sub-

    ject to perturbations, two forms of robustness are frequently

    distinguished and sometimes called, respectively, passive and

    active robustness: (i) resistance, i.e. the withstanding or toler-

    ance of perturbations, and (ii) flexibility, i.e. the ability to

    adapt the configuration of the system in order to limit damage

    (ten Napel et al. 2006). For example, robustness on a pig farm

    level can include genetic components of heat stress tolerance

    in pigs (passive robustness) and temperature control systems

    to adjust indoor conditions in real time (active robustness).

    To conclude, we might say that robustness is a concept that

    goes further than stability through a more precise description

    of the interactions between agricultural systems (and their

    different components) and changes in environmental condi-

    tions. Due to its history, robustness appears to be a concept

    that better integrates biological and technical aspects of agri-

    cultural systems than stability. However, it rarely takes into

    consideration the social aspects of agricultural systems.

    3.3 The concept of vulnerability

    The term vulnerability originates from the Latin word vulnus,

    meaning injury. Vulnerability thus refers to a state of fragility, a

    disposition to be hurt. This concept started to be used in the

    1970s by geographers and social scientists in risk management

    issues to describe the fragility of certain communities or coun-

    tries facing severe environmental or socio-economic risks,

    such as earthquakes (Blaikie et al. 1994) or food exchange

    crises (Watts and Bohle 1993). In the decade after 2000, the

    use of the vulnerability concept increased sharply with its

    adoption by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change

    (IPCC) to assess the potential impacts of global warming at

    regional and global levels (Mc Carthy et al. 2001). As a result,

    vulnerability recently became a very central focus of the global

    change science research community for discussing and defin-

    ing adaptation and mitigation plans (Downing et al. 2005).

    Based on the seminal work by IPCC, the vulnerability con-

    cept benefits from a highly operational framework to describe

    the relationship between the studied system and its environ-

    ment (Adger 2006; Luers et al. 2003; Paavola 2008; Turner

    et al. 2003). This framework usually distinguishes between

    three distinct elements (Fig. 2c): (i) the level of exposure

    (i.e. the frequency, intensity and duration of perturbations af-

    fecting the studied system), (ii) the level of sensitivity (i.e. the

    degree to which the studied system is affected by exposure to

    perturbations) and (iii) the adaptive capacity (i.e. the ability of

    the studied system to deal with perturbations and increase the

    extent of variability that it can cope with).

    This operational framework of vulnerability has allowed its

    use in several fields, including agriculture for which it has

    been applied at various spatial scales (from farms to countries)

    but with an emphasis on the regional level (Reidsma and

    Ewert 2008; Simelton et al. 2009). The vulnerability of agri-

    cultural systems has mainly been studied with regard to the

    exposure to climatic perturbations, such as temperature chang-

    es (Luers et al. 2003), drought (Simelton et al. 2009) or floods

    (McLeman and Smit 2006; Silva and Lucio 2014). It has also

    been used to describe the response of agricultural systems

    exposed to diverse socio-economic changes, such as market

    fluctuations (Luers et al. 2003) or land use changes (Metzger

    et al. 2006). Sensitivity level generally refers to biotechnical

    or socio-economic factors that are intrinsic to agricultural sys-

    tems and interact with external perturbations to amplify or

    reduce their impacts. For example, the level of sensitivity of

    a crop to drought depends to a high degree on soil character-

    istics and access to irrigation (Wilhelmi and Wilhite 2002). At

    regional level, the level of sensitivity of Indian farmers to

    international trade has been evaluated as a function of crop

    productivity and distance to major ports (O’Brien et al. 2004).

    The third factor of vulnerability, the adaptive capacity of

    agricultural systems, is usually described as the system’s ability

    to design and implement effective changes so as to reduce the

    impacts of harmful perturbations. In practice, adaptive capacity

    represents the set of natural, financial, institutional or human

    resources that agricultural systems can mobilize for coping

    with constraints and overcoming them (Brooks and Adger

    2005). Hence, the adaptive capacity of agricultural systems

    encompasses both internal and external factors that can be

    used to deal with a changeable environment. For example,

    Tengö and Hammer (2003) analyzed the role of both manage-

    ment practices and the institutional framework for promoting

    the adaptive capacity of northern Tanzanian agro-pastoralists.

    Thus, vulnerability can be seen as a concept mainly focused

    on the assessment of the potential impacts of perturbations and

    on the target measures needed to reduce them. Compared to the

    concepts of stability and robustness, vulnerability appears to be

    a broader concept that encompasses the biotechnical and social

    factors of agricultural systems. It benefits from an operational

    framework that simplifies its use in various agricultural con-

    texts, including institutional, social and financial determinants.

    3.4 The concept of resilience

    The word resilience comes from the Latin resilio, meaning to

    rebound. Resilience was originally used in material and psy-

    chology sciences to describe the resistance of materials to

    physical shocks (Winson 1932) and the ability of individuals

    to cope with adversity, trauma or other significant sources of

    stress (Murphy 1974), respectively. In ecology, Holling

    (1973) popularized this term by defining the resilience of eco-

    logical systems as a measure of their persistence when

    confronted by unpredictable perturbations and of their ability

    to absorb change. Subsequently, the concept of resilience has

    been increasingly adopted as a generic approach to describe

    social-ecological systems as complex entities which are con-

    tinually transforming themselves through cycles of change

    (Carpenter et al. 2001; Folke et al. 2010; Holling 2005).

    Based on extensive literature from various scientific back-

    grounds, resilience has been variously characterized as a

    loosely organized cluster of concepts (Carpenter and Brock

    2008), a collection of ideas (Anderies et al. 2006) or a way

    of enabling exchanges across disciplines (Brand and Jax

    2007). A first part of this literature mainly focuses on the

    “specific” meaning of resilience and is relatively close to the

    concepts of robustness and vulnerability. In such cases, resis-

    tance to perturbations and rate of recovery after their

    Agron. Sustain. Dev. (2016) 36: 15

    Page 7 of 15

    15

    occurrence are considered as key aspects of resilience

    (Holling 1996). Specific resilience has been used, for exam-

    ple, on vegetative systems to study the rate of recovery after a

    fire (Lavorel 1999) or other natural hazards (MacGillivray and

    Grime 1995). Accordingly, it has been discussed for particular

    aspect of socio-ecological systems and for well-characterized

    perturbations, such as storms, earthquakes, floods and fires,

    for which existing knowledge provides a basis for building

    specified resilience (Carpenter et al. 2012). Another part of

    recent literature was more oriented towards the “general”

    meaning of resilience, i.e. the capacity of socio-ecological

    systems to adapt and transform in response to unfamiliar, un-

    expected and extreme shocks (Holling 2005). In such papers,

    general resilience is studied through the way that socio-

    ecological systems persist and innovate when facing unknown

    perturbations (Walker and Salt 2006). This second aspect of

    resilience is more difficult to apprehend because it refers to

    potential changes outside the scope of experience. For exam-

    ple, it has been used to study how socio-ecological systems

    are transforming themselves in order to continue to achieve

    specific goals, to better anticipate critical transitions in the

    future (Scheffer et al. 2012) and improve conservation plans

    (Standish et al. 2014).

    Resilience thinking, referring both to specific and general

    aspects of resilience, has been applied to a wide variety of

    social-ecological systems, such as everglades (Gunderson

    et al. 2002), marine ecosystems (Mumby et al. 2014) and

    forests (Parrott and Meyer 2012) but less frequently to agri-

    cultural systems. This might be explained by marked differ-

    ences between agricultural and other socio-ecological sys-

    tems, such as a smaller spatial scale, a high controllability of

    the ecological structure and processes on the farm by human

    activities, and the strong influence of economic drivers to

    ensure both the short-term and long-term economic survival

    of agricultural systems (Darnhofer 2010). Moreover, despite

    some extreme examples such as the Dust Bowl period in the

    1930s in North America, after which farmers fundamentally

    changed their practices and adopted planting and plowing

    methods that ensured a better conservation of the soil, critical

    transformations of agricultural systems are not easy to ana-

    lyze, particularly over short time periods.

    Nevertheless, despite these differences, the resilience con-

    cept has recently been applied to several studies dealing with

    the behaviour of agricultural systems facing various kinds of

    perturbation. Reflecting the contrasting understandings of this

    concept, the resilience of agricultural systems has been used in

    several ways: sometimes to measure the degree of resistance

    to shock in the face of economic (Abson et al. 2013) or cli-

    matic perturbations (Keil et al. 2008), but more frequently as

    the ability of agricultural systems to preserve their intrinsic

    functions through flexibility (Astigarraga and Ingrand 2011;

    Carlisle 2014) and plasticity (Rodriguez et al. 2011). In these

    cases, resilience is mainly used to discuss the factors that build

    the ability of agricultural systems to respond to changes, to

    reorganize their structure, to anticipate future changes and to

    take advantage of new opportunities (Folke et al. 2002).

    Resilience is probably the broadest concept among the four

    discussed in this paper. Applied to agricultural systems, it ap-

    pears to be a heuristic framework that is most relevant on a

    long-term basis in order to describe and understand farm trans-

    formations over periods of time marked by significant eco-

    nomic, environmental or sanitary crises (van der Leeuw and

    Aschan-Leygonie 2000). It embeds both a timescale approach

    and a recovery process (Fig. 2d). Hence, contrary to the con-

    cept of vulnerability which focuses on the direct impacts of

    specific perturbations on a given feature of the system, the

    resilience concept mostly focuses on the consequences of one

    to several perturbations, including unpredictable ones, on the

    overall trajectory of the system (Mathevet and Bousquet 2014).

    4 From concepts to assessment in agricultural

    systems

    Based on review literature concerning stability, robustness,

    vulnerability and resilience, it appears that the research com-

    munity has produced an insightful and extensive literature in

    recent years to describe and understand better the behaviour of

    various systems, including agricultural systems, in a context

    of unpredictable change. However, operationalization of these

    concepts into empirical assessments remains limited due to

    their multidimensional nature and because they are not direct-

    ly observable phenomena (Callo-Concha and Ewert 2014).

    The situation is even more complicated when assessments

    are extended from time-limited events, such as drought, to

    gradual perturbations such as climate change. Hence, there is

    an urgent need to have a better knowledge of the models and

    metrics available to quantify the ability of agricultural systems

    to cope with various types of perturbation.

    In this section, we review existing approaches that have

    been used in empirical studies to quantify the stability, robust-

    ness, vulnerability and resilience of agricultural systems.

    These approaches are classified in three categories according

    to the system level at which they were used: (i) approaches

    focusing on the variability of agricultural outputs regardless of

    the context of perturbations, (ii) approaches focusing on the

    relationship between agricultural outputs and perturbations

    and (iii) approaches including a broader scale and taking into

    consideration the adaptive capacity of agricultural systems.

    We illustrate and discuss these different approaches through

    the description of some case studies.

    4.1 Variability of agricultural outputs

    The first approach, and probably the simplest one, quantifies

    the ability of agricultural systems to cope with a changeable

    15

    Page 8 of 15

    Agron. Sustain. Dev. (2016) 36: 15

    environment by characterizing agricultural outputs and their

    variability across large environmental (time, space, manage-

    ment practices) series. This approach has been used in various

    studies and can be carried out using different statistical

    methods. A first method is to quantify the statistical deviation

    of agricultural outputs from the average or median and can be

    undertaken using common indices of statistical dispersal (e.g.

    standard deviation, coefficient of variation, interquartile

    range). For example, Abson et al. (2013) used the coefficient

    of variation of economic returns to study the impact of land-

    scape diversity on economic “resilience” in the UK between

    1996 and 2010.

    Other methods focus more on the behaviour of agricultural

    systems facing rare but extreme perturbations. These methods

    are mainly used in risk assessment studies (Iglesias and Quiroga

    2007; Luo et al. 2009) and are usually based on the analysis of

    output anomaly distribution. For example, Cernay et al. (2015)

    analyzed the yield anomaly distribution of diverse grain le-

    gumes over the period 1961–2013 in order to compare variabil-

    ity in legume yields across Europe and the Americas. More

    precisely, they used value at 10th percentile risk as a measure

    to assess in which countries legume yield losses have been the

    largest over this period. Lastly, other methods focus on the

    probability of achieving farmers’ goals and can be measured

    as the probability that agricultural outputs remain above a

    certain threshold. For example, Sabatier et al. (2015) used a

    stochastic model of grassland dynamics to measure, for various

    grazing strategies, the likelihood of fulfilling the feeding re-

    quirements of grazing animals. They quantified it as the per-

    centage of weather sequences for which the grass resource was

    sufficient to feed the herd present on the grasslands every day.

    Finally, this first approach is relatively close to the stability

    concept because it does not explicitly characterize and take

    into account the intensity and variability of perturbations that

    affect agricultural systems. It only describes a part of the abil-

    ity to cope with an environment subject to perturbations, and it

    does not deal satisfactorily with the ability of agricultural sys-

    tems to resist and adapt to specific perturbations.

    4.2 Relationship between agricultural outputs

    and perturbations

    This second approach focuses on the response of agricultural

    systems to specific perturbations and has been used in various

    studies, referring both to robustness (Mosnier et al. 2009) and

    vulnerability frameworks (Simelton et al. 2009). More pre-

    cisely, this approach is associated with the notion of resistance

    that is frequently used in those two frameworks to refer to a

    low sensitivity of agricultural outputs to environmental system

    conditions. As a result, resistance is measured with respect to

    specific perturbations affecting agricultural systems. Indeed,

    this approach requires the characterization and quantification

    of the intensity of perturbations that affect agricultural systems

    (Li et al. 2009; Wu and Wilhite 2004). For example, Simelton

    et al. (2009) measured a drought index to assess the resistance

    of agricultural production in China to water deficit. The

    drought index was quantified as a negative rainfall anomaly,

    i.e. by the ratio between average amount of rainfall between

    1960 and 2011 and the actual amount of rainfall for each year.

    In livestock systems, perturbations can refer to changes in

    environmental conditions. For example, the variation in the

    herd environment of dairy cows (Windig et al. 2006) and

    breeding sows (Herrero-Medrano et al. 2015) has also been

    studied to measure the resistance of these livestock systems to

    changes in environmental conditions.

    Once perturbations have been characterized and quantified,

    the resistance of agricultural outputs to changes in environ-

    mental conditions is usually assessed through regression

    methods. This method has been used by various authors to

    study the relationship between agricultural outputs and pertur-

    bations which are highly correlated, such as yield and drought

    (Luers et al. 2003) or farmers’ income and price volatility. For

    example, Mosnier et al. (2009) studied the sensitivity of

    farmers’ incomes to climatic and economic perturbations in

    France on a panel of 55 farms. Using multiple linear regres-

    sions, they identified the influence of stocking rates and length

    of production cycles on the sensitivity of livestock systems to

    weather and beef price variation. In Nicaragua, Holt-Giménez

    (2002) has studied the resistance of more than 800 farmers

    after Hurricane Mitch. He discriminated “conventional” and

    “agroecological” farms in order to study, under different levels

    of storm intensity, the differences of response on several indi-

    cators (e.g. erosion or economic returns). He showed that pat-

    terns of resistance are not easy to describe and include com-

    plex interactions and thresholds. However, the differences in

    favour of agroecological plots tended to increase with increas-

    ing levels of storm intensity, increasing slope and increasing

    years under agroecological practices.

    Despite its potential to assess quantitatively the response of

    agricultural outputs to specific changes in the system environ-

    ment, this approach remains limited to biotechnical compo-

    nents of agricultural systems. In particular, social components,

    including adaptive capacity, of agricultural systems are diffi-

    cult to consider in this approach.

    4.3 Multiscale and adaptive capacity assessment

    of agricultural systems

    In order to integrate the different components of agricultural

    systems, a third approach is frequently used. Contrary to the

    two previous ones, this approach focuses on the description of

    internal system features through a set of proxy indicators more

    than on the variability or resistance of agricultural outputs.

    This indicator-based approach is applicable to multiple scales

    and can include the adaptive capacity of agricultural systems

    (Darnhofer et al. 2010). Consequently, this approach has

    Agron. Sustain. Dev. (2016) 36: 15

    Page 9 of 15

    15

    mostly been used for assessing and measuring vulnerability

    (Gbetibouo et al. 2010) and resilience (Quinlan et al. 2015) of

    agricultural systems rather than their stability or robustness.

    In this approach, indicators are generally chosen to de-

    scribe key aspects of biotechnical and social components

    that are supposed to increase or decrease the ability of

    agricultural systems to cope with various perturbations. For

    example, Cabell and Oelofse (2012) compiled 13 behaviour-

    based indicators which cover different properties of agricul-

    tural systems, such as spatial and temporal heterogeneity

    across landscapes and the human resources available on

    farms. Systems in which these 13 indicators are positively

    evaluated are supposed to better resist and adapt to

    perturbations, while a negative evaluation of these indicators

    points to a need for intervention. Based on the vulnerability

    framework, Wiréhn et al. (2015) reviewed indicators of expo-

    sure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity. The latter ones describe

    socio-economic factors that can assist agricultural systems to

    adapt and rebound better after perturbations (e.g. farm income,

    farm size, crop diversification). Altieri et al. (2015) used indi-

    cators of soil conservation practices, crop diversity and food

    self-sufficiency to describe the adaptive capacity of various

    agroecological farms in Latin America. These indicators are

    frequently aggregated and their results displayed in geograph-

    ic representations to improve the identification of the most

    vulnerable, or less resilient, areas within a territory (O’Brien

    et al. 2004; Wilhelmi and Wilhite 2002). This indicator based-

    approach has proven to be valuable for monitoring trends but,

    as reported by Wiréhn et al. (2015), is limited in its applica-

    bility by considerable subjectivity in the selection of variables

    and their relative weights and by the difficulty of testing and

    validating the different metrics.

    To conclude this section, it appears that various approaches

    are available to study the behaviour of agricultural systems in

    a more changeable environment. Despite their differences,

    these approaches can provide additional details and improve

    visibility of what improves the ability of agricultural systems

    to cope with unpredictable changes. In particular, they can

    provide complementary findings at different scales. In the next

    section, we review the main elements that emerge from re-

    searches completed to date.

    5 Key levers for improving the ability of agricultural

    systems to cope with perturbations

    Based on previous sections, it appears that various concepts

    and methods have been mobilized in recent years to charac-

    terize and quantify the ability of agricultural systems to cope

    with a changeable environment. Despite fuzzy boundaries,

    these concepts have specific historical backgrounds and have

    been applied to describe different features and behaviours of

    agricultural systems.

    Based on literature focusing on conceptual definitions and

    empirical assessments in agricultural studies, some key levers

    are emerging as important properties for a transition towards

    more stable, more robust, less vulnerable or more resilient ag-

    ricultural systems. These generic elements are summarized in

    two categories: first, increasing the intrinsic diversity of agri-

    cultural systems and, second, increasing their adaptive capacity.

    5.1 Increasing diversity at different levels

    Based on recent literature, many authors have emphasized the

    potential of increasing diversity in its various forms to im-

    prove the behaviour of agricultural systems when facing var-

    ious perturbations (Altieri et al. 2015; Lin 2011; Naylor 2008;

    Østergård et al. 2009). This assumption relies on the hypoth-

    esis that implementing more diversity at different levels pro-

    vides greater functional redundancy, i.e. system components

    and organization with overlapping functions to buffer year-to-

    year changes. However, diversification can be implemented in

    a variety of forms and at a variety of scales, allowing farmers

    to choose a strategy that both increases their ability to cope

    with perturbations and provides economic benefits Lin (2011).

    Among biological components, increasing genetic diversi-

    ty through cultivars and animal breeds characterized by dif-

    ferent agronomic features (e.g. diversity in earliness for culti-

    vars; diversity in disease resistance for animal breeds) is sup-

    posed to spread the risks of failure by reducing the overall

    exposure to perturbations (Di Falco and Perrings 2003;

    Tooker and Frank 2012). Increasing breeding of cultivars

    and animals with distinctive traits is therefore becoming a

    research priority to allow farmers to choose biological com-

    ponents adapted to various contexts and perturbations

    (Casadebaig et al. 2014; Knap 2005). Similarly, increasing

    diversity at the species level by using crops characterized by

    different exposure periods and sensitivity features allows the

    spreading of risks through the entire cropping rotation (Lin

    2011). Following seminal work by Hector et al. (1999),

    Tilman et al. (2006) showed that greater complementary and

    functional diversity among grassland species were able to sta-

    bilize annual plant production. As reported by Huyghe et al.

    (2014), the use of mixtures of grasses and legumes has been

    largely implemented in grasslands worldwide.

    Increasing diversity is also feasible by changing the nature

    of crop rotations and introducing perennial tree crops into

    annual cropping systems. Based on complementarities be-

    tween annual crops and trees, agroforestry systems are char-

    acterized by a strong structural complexity (Jose 2009). These

    systems have demonstrated their capacity to provide a better

    protection for annual crops not only from habitual climatic

    perturbations (changes in temperature and precipitation), but

    also from extreme perturbations such as hurricanes (Lin

    2011). At a larger scale, increasing diversity through regional

    landscape diversity is also a strategy for minimizing the

    15

    Page 10 of 15

    Agron. Sustain. Dev. (2016) 36: 15

    impacts of perturbations on agricultural systems: Reidsma and

    Ewert (2008) showed that diversity in farm size and intensity

    (e.g. cultivar choice, fertilizer and pesticide use) reduces the

    regional vulnerability of wheat production to climate change.

    Abson et al. (2013) also found that land use diversification in

    the UK was positively correlated with the resilience of agri-

    cultural returns in the face of uncertain market and environ-

    mental conditions. Furthermore, preserving or increasing the

    diversity of agricultural systems can also maintain or stimulate

    various resources (technology, information and knowledge) at

    the territorial level that can be used by farmers in order to cope

    with current or future challenges (Nelson et al. 2007). In that

    sense, increasing diversity of agricultural systems can also

    improve their adaptive capacity.

    5.2 Increasing the adaptive capacity of agricultural

    systems

    Cited mainly in robustness, vulnerability and resilience litera-

    ture, adaptive capacity refers to the ability of agricultural sys-

    tems to transform their nature or structure to cope with an

    ever-changing environment (Milestad et al. 2012). It focuses

    on ensuring sufficient room for manoeuvre, identifying tran-

    sition capabilities and extending the degrees of freedom of

    agricultural systems. More often emphasized in livestock than

    in cropping systems (Blanc et al. 2010), adaptive capacity can

    be improved at different levels and in biological, technical and

    organizational components.

    Applied to biological components, adaptive capacity has

    been widely discussed in robustness literature as a key breed-

    ing goal for animal breeding (Knap 2005). It refers to the

    ability of animals to adjust their behaviour to exogenous con-

    straints. For example, the adaptive capacity of dairy cows may

    refer to their ability to mobilize body reserves during specific

    periods in order to support milk production. Blanc et al. (2010)

    showed that animals in extensive livestock systems are fre-

    quently adjusting their behaviour and physiological responses

    to cope with low-feed-intake periods. Such ability to adjust

    their behaviour varies between breeds and highlights their abil-

    ity to produce and maintain their reproduction in an unstable

    environment. Various research programs have focused on in-

    creasing these properties in various plants and animals (Knap

    2005; ten Napel et al. 2006), but some authors have underlined

    a potential trade-off between intrinsic adaptive capacity and the

    productivity of livestock systems (Sabatier et al. 2015).

    On a larger scale, improving the adaptive capacity of agri-

    cultural systems can be based on improvements in the design

    of agricultural systems and the implementation of technical

    components designed to help farmers to adjust day-to-day

    operations. For example, design can rely on the choice of

    renewable materials, such as bedding material, feeder type

    for livestock and new fertilizers and decision support tools

    in crops to prevent abiotic or biotic risks. Several tools are

    already available to inform farmers about pest outbreaks, soil

    water availability or nitrogen nutrition index, and farmers can

    opportunistically respond to variability by adjusting pesticide,

    irrigation or fertilizer uses (Mulla 2013). In livestock systems,

    increasing adaptive capacity can also refer to organizational

    management and to the adaptation in time and space of feed

    management to secure feed supply, especially in grassland

    systems that can be highly sensitive to drought periods

    (Mosnier et al. 2009; Tichit et al. 2004). By introducing more

    flexibility in agricultural systems, these technical and decision

    making components emerge as important characteristics of

    agricultural systems which consciously or automatically ad-

    just options to reliable clues from the environment in which

    they operate (Rodriguez et al. 2011).

    Beyond farm scale, adaptive capacity can also be improved

    through collective actions between stakeholders that voluntar-

    ily share their goals and production tools. Ireland and

    Thomalla (2011) showed that collective action between farms

    can promote the establishment of social networks and enhance

    the ability of local stakeholders to cope with a changeable

    environment. It may also increase their financial resources

    which can be used during times of hardship. These new forms

    of cooperation between farms are also helping them to estab-

    lish new relationships with downstream industries and to

    adapt better to changes in market context.

    6 Conclusion

    The context of increasing uncertainty induces major chal-

    lenges for agricultural systems. The need for more sustainable

    agricultural systems in an increasingly changeable environ-

    ment implies a shift from the aim of maximizing agricultural

    outputs in a non-disturbed environment to the aim of main-

    taining desired levels of outputs in a context of unpredictable

    perturbations. For agronomists, it entails the need for a better

    characterization and quantification of the ability of agricultur-

    al systems to cope with unpredictable changes. A literature

    review of stability, robustness, vulnerability and resilience

    highlighted several differences and complementarities be-

    tween these four concepts. Depending on the system’s scale,

    the type of agricultural output studied and the kind of pertur-

    bation, each concept can be meaningful and provide insights

    to better characterize agricultural system behaviour in the face

    of perturbations. This literature review also provided insights

    into the various methods available to quantify these properties

    in agricultural systems, from the analysis of the variability and

    resistance of agricultural outputs to multiscale and indicator-

    based assessments. Based on this literature, increasing diver-

    sity and adaptive capacity of agricultural systems emerge as

    key drivers for increasing the ability of agricultural systems to

    cope with different types of perturbation. However, further

    empirical studies are still needed to test and validate these

    methods and results in various contexts and across various

    spatial and temporal scales. Further research is needed to work

    out to what extent and based on which value judgements the

    urge for more stable, more robust, less vulnerable or more

    resilient agricultural production systems is moving research

    towards a course of breeding stable cultivars, towards breed-

    ing robust cows, towards protection and exposure avoidance

    or towards resilience and adaptation. Of particular interest are

    the trade-offs involved.

  explanation: This research presents a brief overview of resilience in socio-ecological
    systems, emphasizing the interplay between social and ecological factors and the
    significance of alternate stable states. Resilience is explored in the context
    of historic rice cultivation in the US South, specifically examining the challenges
    and adaptations associated with rice production in the region from the 17th to
    the 21st centuries. The study highlights the transition from inland to tidal rice
    cultivation, the role of enslaved labor, the impact of the 13th Amendment, the
    importance of wetlands, and the influence of climate change on current rice field
    infrastructure. The authors emphasize the need for considering alternative stable
    states and evaluating mitigating solutions to potential risks in the face of environmental
    and societal changes.

    Abstract While resilience is deﬁned differentially by social scientists and ecolo-

    gists, sustainability is possible where resilient social and ecological systems
    meet

    and interact, and sustainable resilient systems promote societal use of ecosystem

    services supporting contemporary societal needs without risk to future generations.

    Yet it is possible for seemingly appropriate and rational decisions from individuals,

    and society at large, to be counter to long-term sustainable solutions. Historic
    rice

    ﬁeld cultivation in the wetlands of the Carolinas and Florida provides an example

    of various forms of resilience and sustainability within the theoretical framework
    of

    alternate stable states, whereby a resilient system can exist in more than one
    state

    and where stability is achieved when disruptive variables are not so disruptive
    as

    to generate tipping points from one state to another. This contribution examines

    the changing role and political as well as environmental impacts of rice agricul-

    ture in the region with particular emphasis on the contingent processes of envi-

    ronmental and cultural transformation that took place between the seventeenth
    and

    twenty-ﬁrst centuries.

    Deﬁning Resilience

    The anthropogenic modiﬁcation of Earth and Earth systems has, in recent years,

    garnered attention from a variety of academic disciplines resulting in increased

    awareness and interest in resiliency across multiple system types that include
    ecolog-

    ical and social systems. Generally, resilience is the amount of disturbance a
    system

    canabsorbwithout changingstate(Gunderson2000, 426). However, resiliencecanbe

    deﬁned differentially by various disciplines: social scientists deﬁne social resilience

    as comprising three dimensions—coping capacity, adaptive capacity, and transfor-

    mative capacity (Keck and Sakdapolrak 2013, 5–7). Ecologists measure ecological

    resilience by the magnitude of disturbance that can be absorbed by a system before
    its

    variables and processes controlling the system’s behavior are changed such that
    the

    system redeﬁnes its structure or settles in an alternate stable state (Gunderson
    2000,

    426). Ecologists also identify systems designed with a single operating objective
    and

    a global optimum where alternate states should be avoided as engineering resilience

    (Gunderson 2000, 426).

    There is potential for sustainability where resilient social and ecological systems

    meet and shape one another through various interactions. Sustainable resilient

    systemspromotesocietaluseofecosystemservicessupportingcontemporarysocietal

    needs without risk to future generations (Adger and Hodbod 2013). It is possible
    for

    seemingly appropriate and rational decisions from individuals, and society at
    large, to

    be counter to long-term sustainable solutions, even to the point where the resiliency

    of the support systems that promote such decisions is disrupted (Kahn 1966, 23,
    24,

    27). The consequences of known and unknown socio-ecological risks to the present

    and the future are diminished where resilient systems support sustainability (Adger

    and Hodbod 2013, 79–81). Risks that may be mitigated include changing climate,

    natural disasters, and wholesale socio-political systems change (e.g., abolition
    of

    slavery).

    Alternate stable states theory suggests a resilient system can exist in more than
    one

    state. A state is considered stable when the disruptive variables inﬂuencing it
    are not

    so disruptive that it shifts state or regimes. The resiliency of a system determines
    how

    large of a perturbation the system can experience without the system shifting
    states.

    Stable state theory is commonly visualized with a cup-and-ball diagram (Fig. 1),

    where the “cup” represents the system, and the ball represents the state of the
    system.

    The parameters maintaining the system state are represented by the walls of the
    cup;

    the position of the ball in the cup represents the state of the system. When the
    ball is

    at the bottom of the cup (i.e., the basin of attraction) the system is most stable.
    The

    steepness of the walls determines the return time of the system after disturbance,

    whereas the width of the cup pertains to the system’s resilience. Negative feedback

    mechanisms tend to push the system back towards the stable bottom of the cup after
    a

    perturbation. For the system to change to an alternate state, the perturbation
    must be

    large enough for the ball to breach the precipice of the cup and enter another
    stable

    state. Once an alternative stable state has been entered it is unlikely that the
    previous

    stable state can be reclaimed.

    Fig. 1 Characteristics of socio-ecological stable states are represented by the
    various components

    of the cup-and-ball diagram. The state of the system is represented by the ball,
    while the parameters

    that control the system’s state are represented by the walls of the cup. In the
    ﬁgure presented there

    is a transition era where the precipice of the original state (i.e., Era of “rice
    culture”) has been

    breached and the system is gaining momentum towards transitioning to the contemporary
    era but

    there are a variety of forces attempting to push the system’s state back into
    the stability of the era

    of “rice culture”. We refer to this era as a transition era

    Resilience on Lowcountry Wetlands and in Lowcountry Rice

    Fields

    The economic, cultural, and environmental signiﬁcance of southeastern rice is
    almost

    completely obscured by that of King Cotton, the export crop that came to dominate

    southern agriculture by the mid-1800s. Even still, the role of rice agriculture
    is almost

    completely unknown to the American consciousness as the driving national force
    it

    once was, one that created the wealthiest planters and largest slaveholders in
    British

    North America before the American Revolution. South Carolina rice planters claimed

    Nathaniel Heyward, the wealthiest slave holder with the largest slave holdings,
    as

    one of their own until his death in 1851 (Heyward 1993, xi, liv, 3–6, 12–13, 18–19).

    The value of rice to global society has been and continues to be immense.

    Across time and space, Queen Rice can demonstrate how human labor and

    wetlands can be harnessed for economic ends, and how such systems can be resilient

    or collapse with political change such as that of the 13th Amendment of the US

    Constitution. Wetlands are valuable natural resources that provide high biological

    diversity. They ﬁlter and transform nutrients and pollutants and act to buffer
    the

    impacts of human activities on downstream aquatic systems (Hook 1993, 2157,

    2160). Wetlands have been transformed in West Africa’s Upper Guinea Coast since

    c. 1500 CE (Fields-Black 2008, 135–160) and in North America since the 1720s to

    grow rice as a staple and commodity crop. In North America, the modiﬁcation of

    wetlands continued into the 1920s (Heyward 1993, x, xxii–xxx, xxxiii–xxxiv, liii–liv,

    14, 33–34, 45, 48, 50, 54, 56, 60, 62, 63–65, 67–69, 74–75, 81–82, 90, 213–216,
    39).

    During this period, some 234,354 acres of wetlands in South Carolina were modiﬁed

    Fig. 2 Historic rice ﬁelds of the coastal plains of the southeastern U.S.A. extend
    from southeastern

    North Carolina to northeastern Florida. In green are the results of a mapping
    project using high

    resolution LiDAR to identify the historic rice ﬁelds of South Carolina

    for rice production (Hanks et al. 2021, 7) (Fig. 2). Historic rice ﬁelds provide
    an

    interesting case study of the various forms of resilience and sustainability within
    the

    theoretical framework of alternate stable states.

    Wetland clearing, tree stump removal, land leveling, and construction of water

    retention devices resulted in the ﬁrst foray in the coastal plains of southeastern
    North

    Carolina to northeastern Florida, U.S.A. into the culture of rice as a staple
    crop

    to be followed with its use as a commodity crop. Ecosystems over extensive areas

    were substantially transformed by the rice economy and altered soils, vegetation,
    and

    hydrologies present invaluable opportunities for habitat conservation, speciﬁcally
    for

    economically important and migratory waterfowl. Queen Rice also provides impor-

    tant insights into resilience, in that ongoing and ecological and human dynamics

    produce new and invaluable stable states despite previous collapses.

    The Queen Rice economy was entirely dependent on enslaved people to help

    planters identify microenvironments where rice could be successfully cultivated
    and

    perform the arduous labor of converting coastal plain marshes and forests to rice
    agri-

    culture from the late 1600s to mid-1800s. Enslaved laborers levelled the primeval

    forest, felling cypress trees with axes–trunks of the largest cypress trees measured

    up to 12 ft in circumference–and deracinated the cypress knees with hand tools

    (Harper 1998, 59). Enslaved laborers made the earth as “level as a billiard table”

    with shovels, baskets, and planks of wood and moved 500,000 cubic feet of river

    muck per mile on South Carolina’s Cooper River alone to construct the hydraulic
    irri-

    gation system (Rosengarten 1998, 40; Ferguson 1992, 147). Then, enslaved laborers

    cultivated, harvested, and processed the rice crops and maintained the hydraulic
    irri-

    gation system. American and European slave traders imported an estimated 198,314

    Africa captives into South Carolina and Georgia colonies between 1701 and 1858

    (www.slavevoyages.com). It is likely that the majority of these enslaved people
    were

    forced to labor in the swamps on Lowcounty South Carolina and Georgia rice plan-

    tations. South Carolina rice planters and congressmen led the legislative lobby
    to

    keep the trans-Atlantic slave trade open and legal. The Compromise of 1796 resulted

    in the abolition of the trans-Atlantic slave trade in US colonies in 1808. The
    illegeal

    slave trade continued into the Lowcountry. South Carolina and Georgia’s share
    of

    slave importation equalled more than half (53%) of the entire number of African

    captives imported into the US mainland. (www.slavevoyages.com). Dependence on

    an unfree and unpaid labor system set up a social system and an economic system,

    a plantation economy, which were not resilient.

    The earliest rice culture was not resilient. It used low-lying, inland freshwater

    environments, valley bottoms of cypress-hardwood streams, and wetlands at the

    heads of creeks and rivers. Colonial naturalist Mark Catesby described the land

    that planters converted as “impregnated by the washings from the higher lands”

    over a period of years to become “deep soyl [sic]…a sandy loam of a dark brown

    colour” (Catesby 1771, iii). Early planters adapted rice cultivation techniques
    to the

    Lowcountry environment. Inland, freshwater swamp rice plantations depended on

    the natural features of watersheds to better irrigate rice ﬁelds. By hand, enslaved

    laborers cleared hardwood forests of cypress, tupelo, and sweet gum trees, exposing

    soils with slow water permeability and high water-holding capacity into which
    rice

    was sowed.

    The ﬁelds were located on low-lying nearly level terrain with very slight

    downward-sloping grades (0–2%) that allowed drainage of freshwater into the rice

    ﬁelds. Locations of rice ﬁelds were chosen to take advantage of water from higher

    elevations ﬂowing down into the ﬁelds from surface and groundwater sources (Smith

    2019, 3–6, 7–8, 29–35, 38, 96–97, 109–112, 116–118, 120–121). Enslaved laborers

    built clayey embankments that retained water in reservoirs and quarter-drains
    then

    released it.

    The 1700s saw demand and market share for rice from the Carolinas increase and

    concurrently, the development of more effective technologies and infrastructures

    for managing water. By 1710, rice had become South Carolina’s most successfully

    cultivated staple crop and by the 1730s demand for rice exports was exploding.

    Annual exports from Charleston harbor increased ﬁve-fold between 1720 to 1740,

    from about 6 to 30 million pounds (Coclanis 1989, 83). Growth in the 1730s is
    partly

    attributed to the relaxation of the British Navigation Acts, enabling Carolina
    planters

    to export rice directly to Southern Europe on British ships.

    Planters in the early eighteenth century were focused on economic growth. But,

    with increased demand and market share, planters established greater management

    control over the ﬂow of water into the rice ﬁelds by constructing a complex of

    278

    E. L. Fields-Black et al.

    irrigation channels, trunks, and gates. Early trunks consisted of hollowed out
    tree

    trunks with plugs on each end. The irrigation resembled technologies used in West

    Africa’s rice-growing region (Carney 1996, 27; Doar 1970, 12). Planters further

    mechanized water control systems with valves, rectangular boxes that were open
    to

    incoming water on one end, and sliding gates to trap and release freshwater into
    the

    rice ﬁelds. Simultaneously, the valves resembled technologies English farmers
    were

    using to drain fens (Edelson 2006, 6, 34, 48, 73–74, 76, 197).

    Despite technological improvements, inland rice cultivation presented serious

    limits to the agricultural system’s potential for growth. Planters were limited
    by

    the unidirectional ﬂow of stream and river water, and gestating rice was vulnerable

    to both droughts and ﬂoods. Subtropical storm runoff readily breached the earthen

    embankments and washed out inland rice ﬁelds. On the other hand, the burgeoning

    rice export trade demanded more efﬁcient, reliable, and predictable irrigation
    systems

    that would give planters more control over water.

    South Carolina rice planter, Nathaniel Hayward’s, primary inheritance was an

    inland rice ﬁelds on a tributary of the Broad River in Beaufort County, South
    Carolina

    and tidal rice ﬁelds only partially reclaimed near the Combahee River. He made
    a

    good faith effort planting the inland rice ﬁelds, which took advantage of water
    on

    higher elevations in the marsh where evergreen loblolly pine and oak trees grew
    in

    dry, sandy, clay soils without altering the environment. Nathaniel Heyward planted

    his inland rice ﬁelds for only one season. When the rice was still in the ﬁelds
    and

    almost ready to be harvested, a “freshet” destroyed the entire crop. Legend has
    it that

    he drove out to his inland rice ﬁeld in his buggy the next morning after the storm

    to survey the damage. His ﬁne rice crop was submerged. Heyward took one look

    at the water covering it, got back in the buggy, and never went back to or planted

    the inland rice ﬁeld again. From this point, he focused on managing his brothers’

    inheritances, draining the swamps on his partially reclaimed tidal ride ﬁelds
    and his

    brothers’ larger tidal rice ﬁelds, and subsequently acquiring and building his
    own

    empire, 17 “gold mines,” tidal rice ﬁelds on the Combahee River in South Carolina’s

    Colleton County (Heyward 1993, 11–12, 14, 50, 65–67).

    Inland rice culture provided means to store water in reserve systems as a way
    to

    provide some mitigation against unpredictable water supply, which was the primary

    threat to a successful crop (Smith 2019, 3, 9, 81–82, 88, 99, 195; Coclanis 1989,

    78–83). There remained some uncertainty for successful crop production depending

    on the severity of the drought where upstream reserves could not store enough
    water

    to supply the downstream rice ﬁeld. It was not until the development of the tidal
    ﬁeld

    system that large scale and consistent rice crops could be produced and shipped
    to

    market.UnlikeNathanielHeyward,notallriceplantersgaveupinlandricecultivation

    entirely. Middling planters who were not uber-wealthy like the Heywards, continued

    to grow inland rice primarily for subsistence. After the collapse of the Queen
    Rice

    economy in the early twentieth century, African American farmers on heirs’ property,

    property owned by the descendants of landowners who died intestate, well into
    the

    twentieth century (Heyward 1993, xiii–xiv; Hilliard 1975, 57–58; Merrens 1972,

    187, 192; Smith 2019, 3, 9, 81–82, 88, 99, 195; Vernon 1993, 248, n.9, 274 n.7).

    279

    Inland swamp rice production was not perfect. It did not allow planters to control

    water and often led to too much water, in torrential deluges called freshets,
    or too

    little water in the rice ﬁelds. Perfecting water control would require more technology,

    more labor, even more knowledge of the coastal wetlands, and much more capital

    to reclaim the swamps and establish tidal rice production. It would take another
    few

    decades for all of these factors to come together in the mid-eighteenth century.

    Tidal rice plantations were based on a simple principle of water control; they

    used the fresh water in river estuaries, which rose and fell with the tides, to
    ﬂood

    rice ﬁelds. Tidal rice ﬁelds are located in an inland zone that is close enough
    to

    the coast to experience tidal ﬂuctuations but far enough upstream to be freshwater.

    This geographic location allowed them to take advantage of the predictable tidal

    ﬂuctuations and the associated freshwater wedge, thereby allowing the management

    of freshwater into and out of the ﬁelds.

    Tidal rice plantations used water-control structures to inundate ﬁelds with the

    freshwater of estuaries that ﬂoated on top of the salt water and that rose and
    fell

    with the tides. With predictable environmental conditions (i.e., predictable supply
    of

    freshwater) ensured, the physical structure of the former wetlands as tidal rice
    ﬁelds

    became engineered and managed. As the process of rice culture in tidal ﬁelds was

    ﬁne tuned and overall yield per acre increased, the tidal ﬁelds system was focused
    on

    a singularly objective, the production of rice for its market value. The immensity
    of

    the change to the structure and function of the wetlands across such a large geography

    resulted in a state shift from natural wetlands to engineered and managed wetlands,

    or rice ﬁelds. This combination made for the only naturally irrigated soils in
    the US.

    When management control was established over the hydrology of tidal wetlands,
    the

    area of rice cultivation greatly expanded.

    Planters and enslaved laborers selected level land along rivers with tidal estuaries,

    impacted by the tides, accessing freshwater on either side. Planters and enslaved

    laborers converted level ﬂoodplains and swamplands along tidal rivers to rice
    ﬁelds,

    managing both fresh- and saltwater. Canals with ﬂoodgates were even constructed

    to channel freshwater from tidal estuaries to remote rice ﬁelds.

    Slave labor was used throughout the time where the methodology of growing rice

    in the southern coastal plains of the United States was ﬁne-tuned and increasingly

    focused on the tidal rice system. This societal stable state allowed forced and
    enslaved

    labor to transform a vast geography of wetlands across these coastal plains (more

    than 234, 354 acres in South Carolina, USA alone) (Hanks et. al. 2021, 7). Enslaved

    laborers converted tidal swamps to rice ﬁelds with water control infrastructures
    by

    building ditches and embankments around an entire ﬂoodplain. Next, they cleared,

    burned, and removed trees and stumps. Embankments that surrounded ﬁelds had

    wooden “trunks” installed for ﬂooding and drainage. Trunks passed through the

    dikes and allowed movement between rice ﬁelds or between a tidal rice ﬁeld and

    the tidal river. Initially, cypress trunks were used after being hollowed from
    top to

    bottom and installing a large plug to control water ﬂow. Trunks eventually evolved

    into sophisticated wooden structures with gates at each end that opened and shut

    depending on the tide. Individual ﬁelds had cross ditches and channels excavated

    and check banks installed for highly precise water level control (Fig. 3). In
    the ﬁnal

    stage, enslaved laborers planted rice on the ﬂoodplains.

    Fig. 3 Comparison and description of inland (a) and tidal rice ﬁeld (b) morphology.
    Inland ﬁelds

    are linear, gravity fed wetlands. Widths of these wetlands can range from over
    1000’ wide to just

    100’ wide. Inland ﬁelds are bordered by uplands. Tidal ﬁelds were constructed
    in ﬂoodplain areas

    between sections of tidal, freshwater rivers and uplands. Inland ﬁelds tend to
    be narrow and long

    which result in smaller acreage impoundments. Tidal ﬁelds are not as constrained
    by adjacent

    uplands and individual impoundments on the average are larger acreages than those
    in inland rice

    ﬁelds

    Conversion of a tidal swamp was a “great undertaking,” one considerably more

    difﬁcult than that of the inland swamps. It required signiﬁcant engineering knowledge

    andknowledgeofthenaturallandscape,aswellasintensivecapitalandenslavedlabor

    inputs over many years. In addition to clearing and leveling the land, constructing

    the hydraulic irrigation system, enslaved laborers maintained the irrigation system

    against the threat of breaks in the embankments and the rush of water. Because
    of

    the capital, labor, and time demands of tidal rice culture, only wealthy planters
    with

    multiple investments like Nathaniel Heyward, not small farmers, could undertake

    swamp reclamation. Then, they reinvested proﬁts from one tidal rice plantation
    into

    acquiring more labor and reclaiming more tidal lands. The intensiﬁcation of capital

    in the new American economy was vital to tidal rice culture (Heyward 1993, 18).
    By

    the mid-eighteenth century, tidal rice culture was extensive. By 1770, rice exports

    exceeded 60 million pounds per year (Fig. 1), largely due to tidal rice cultivation

    (Coclanis 1989, 83).

    The system of slave labor became entangled with the environmental system of

    engineered and managed rice ﬁelds so intensively that the environmental system
    of

    engineered and managed rice ﬁelds could not exist were it not for the social system.

    With the environmental system of rice production now being stable and consistent

    (i.e., in an alternate stable state) across such a large geography and the singular
    focus

    of the rice ﬁelds being to produce marketable rice, slave labor became an integral
    cog

    in the socio-environmental system of rice culture in the southeastern United States.

    In other words, to maintain the stability of the environmental system (i.e., rice
    ﬁelds)

    required the stability of the social system where slave labor was foundational.

    The full tragedy of Queen Rice is that African–Americans were at high risk of

    disease and survival rates were notably low in New World rice plantations. Though

    yields of tidal rice were incredibly productive and ﬁnancially lucrative and though

    enslaved laborers contributed labor as well as critical skills, tidal rice culture
    came

    at a high cost for enslaved laborers. The saturated and inundated environments
    of the

    inland and tidal rice ﬁelds were extremely unhealthy environments. Rice plantations

    in the South Carolina and Georgia lowcountry had among the highest death rates

    among enslaved children and adults in the US, and second only to sugar plantations

    in the entire New World (Forster and Smith 2011, 909, 923). Whereas death rates

    for slaves on cotton and tobacco plantations dropped to approximately 33% by the

    1780s, double the number, approximately two-thirds, of enslaved people still died
    on

    lowcountry rice plantations up until the Civil War. Along the Savannah River,
    90%

    of children enslaved on rice plantations died before 15 years of age. In the winter
    of

    1839 when most of the children died on Pierce Butler’s Butler Island rice plantation

    on the Altamaha River near Darien, GA, the mother of a child who recently died

    described the plight of many women enslaved on Lowcountry rice plantations saying

    over and over again to Fannie Kemble, Butler’s English wife: “I’ve lost a many;
    they

    all goes so” (Dusinberre 1996, 2–3, 49–51, 55–56, 58, 61, 74, 80–81, 84, 103,
    121,

    188, 199, 237–238, 240–241, 245, 325, 412–413, 415–416; Kemble 1984, 130).

    The tight coupling of the social and environmental systems in the production of

    rice as a commodity crop through the engineered tidal ﬁeld system operated within
    an

    engineering resilience framework. Production of rice for market value was the
    single

    objective of the tidal rice ﬁeld system and any alternate state, for either the
    environ-

    mental or social system, was potentially not acknowledged but certainly to be
    avoided

    at all costs. Maintaining the system in an engineering resilient framework required

    constant input of energy which was provided by slave labor. Southern planters
    were

    unable to assess potential risks to the coupled socio-environmental system they
    had

    developed and fostered because they were operating in an engineering resiliency

    state-of-mind, where no other potential alternate stable states were envisaged.
    In this

    framework, the environmental stability of the tidal rice ﬁelds was a requisite
    that had

    to be maintained to produce rice and the only way this was possible was through

    slave labor.

    The external forces that tested the resilience of the environmental system (i.e.,

    engineered and managed tidal rice ﬁelds) still existed in both chronic (e.g.,
    the erosion

    of dikes along riverbanks) and episodic (e.g., hurricanes) but this was overcome
    with

    the immense human power of forced free labor provided by a social system that

    enabled slave labor. Any threats to the social system (i.e., slavery) was quashed
    by

    the system itself. That is until the American Civil War put an end to slavery.
    At this

    point, both environmental and social systems underwent interlinked perturbations

    that allowed both to realize various trajectories previously unacknowledged and

    likely beyond contemporaneous comprehension. People who were once enslaved

    were now “free” and those who enslaved them now had to envision new ways to

    manage their engineered rice ﬁelds without slave labor. This resulted in a period

    after the American Civil War where planters attempted to continue to produce and

    manage rice as a commodity crop within the engineered rice ﬁelds up until the

    282

    E. L. Fields-Black et al.

    last commercial rice crop in South Carolina was produced by ss. In Fig. 1 this
    is

    represented by the small (and temporary) alternate stable state (termed “transition

    era”), which was fragile at best, requiring only small perturbations to push the
    system

    into a completely different stable state. These perturbations came in the form
    of

    several hurricanes and disruptions in market supply chains that affected planters
    in

    the southeastern coastal plains.

    This transition era reﬂects the point made in Haldon et al. (2020, 1) that systems

    seldom collapse in the dramatic fashion so often popularized in modern culture.
    The

    rice culture that began in the 1670s and saw its ultimate demise beginning just
    prior

    to the American Civil War did not change the social nor the environmental systems

    in rapid fashion. Still today American society struggles with racism, some 155
    years

    after the end of the American Civil War. The environmental system continues to

    change and may require more time to reach the stable bottom of the cup than that
    of

    the social system.

    The postbellum social system disrupted the production of rice as a commodity

    crop in the southeastern U.S. due to the abolishment of slavery, but it also affected

    the engineered rice ﬁelds where, after some time, it was no longer seen as a tenable

    option to manage for rice production. These managed wetlands now experienced

    various ecological trajectories. While some previously managed ﬁelds were unman-

    aged and allowed to “re-wild,” still others were managed for another objective–

    waterfowl hunting. The utilization of rice ﬁelds for waterfowl hunting beginning

    in the 1910 and 1920s has continued to evolve as a conservation ethic has perco-

    lated through this region. In recent years management of engineered tidal rice
    ﬁelds

    has become more diverse in the set of objectives that now includes, along with

    waterfowl, ecosystem services such as wildlife habitat (e.g., black rail, wood
    storks,

    roseate spoonbill, American alligator, etc.). These “new” objectives and their
    socio-

    environmental stable states are represented by the third cup in Fig. 1 and have
    yet to

    be fully established.

    Resilience, Climate Change, and the 21st Century Rice Field

    Infrastructure

    Given that the rice ﬁelds in South Carolina have signiﬁcant historical, cultural
    and

    ecological signiﬁcance, it is prudent to consider the permanence of these man
    made

    systems. Over the course of rice history in South Carolina, there have been several

    shifts in locations and objectives of rice ﬁelds. Initially the potential to reap
    ﬁnancial

    proﬁts started the rice economy in South Carolina and planters developed and used

    the inland ﬁeld system. Ultimately tidal rice ﬁelds provided a ﬁnancially successful

    alternative to inland ﬁelds and planters shifted their development and management
    in

    this area. These tidal ﬁelds (and inland ﬁelds to a lesser degree) transitioned
    from a

    ﬁnancial to an ecological objective with the end of rice as a commodity crop and
    the

    rise of sporting pursuits on the rice plantations. From the early twentieth century
    this

    Resilience of Coupled Socio-Ecological Systems: Historic Rice Fields …

    283

    ecological objective has persisted and become more diverse with recognition that
    the

    management of these tidal and inland rice ﬁelds beneﬁts waterfowl and many other

    non-game species like bald eagles, wood storks, black rails, etc.

    There is increasing awareness by the owners and managers of the rice ﬁelds that

    the permanence of the existing system is being inﬂuenced negatively. Federal,
    state,

    and private owners of rice ﬁelds are faced with changing forces on this infrastruc-

    ture. Decision making about how, when and how much to invest in these man-made

    systems is complex and has been ongoing since their creation.

    Rice ﬁelds are composed of raised dikes that prevent water from entering or

    exiting a particular area where rice was grown and now is managed for wildlife

    habitat (Fig. 3). Canals were excavated to enable water ﬂow throughout the system.

    Water control structures were placed in dikes to permit water retention or dewatering

    in these rice ﬁelds. Other than the water control structures (which are typically

    wooden), this system is constructed from onsite mud and soil. The properties of
    this

    mud and soil have inﬂuenced the maintenance regimes of the earthen infrastructure

    from the very inception of rice ﬁeld construction in the early eighteenth century.
    As

    an example, some plantations may have been established along sections of rivers

    where the local material had a high sand content. Other rice ﬁelds were established

    along particular rivers where the available soil material was higher in loam or
    clay.

    When building dikes that stand 4–6’ above the wetland grade, soils with higher
    clay

    content are able to persist longer with the normal erosion forces of rain, travel
    across

    the dikes, etc. These constant erosion forces require these dikes to have material

    placed back on top and the interim period between these efforts can vary from
    5 to

    10 years for areas of sand versus 10–15 years for areas of material with higher
    clay

    content.

    Rice planters initially and wildlife habitat managers today have dealt with this

    constant degradation of the built rice ﬁeld system. Retopping dikes, installing
    new

    water control structures, excavating canals for improved water circulation were
    all

    acts that have been required from the very beginning of rice culture and were
    incor-

    porated into the mental calculus of determining whether it was worth the ﬁnancial

    investment to perform these remedial acts. Maintenance and repair issues have
    always

    been a part of the rice ﬁeld landscape and until recent decades were costs nearly
    all

    were willing to bear to maintain the system.

    The costs and efforts, though, of maintaining rice ﬁelds, especially tidal ones,

    has become more costly and more frequent in recent decades. Environmental forces

    that have been inﬂuenced by climate change are causing increased degradation and

    loss of the rice ﬁeld infrastructure. These forces include increases in tidal
    amplitude

    as driven by sea level rise and increase in the frequency of tropical storm events
    as

    a result of climate change. We discuss each of these factors below and how they

    negatively impact rice ﬁeld infrastructure.

    Tidal rice ﬁelds were placed along the tidal rivers in creeks to take advantage

    of the tidal, freshwater. Dikes and water control structures allowed the intentional

    ﬂooding and dewatering of the rice ﬁelds depending on different times of the rice

    growing season. Since the transition to management of wildlife habitat, the inten-

    tional ﬂooding and dewatering of the tidal rice ﬁelds enables management for native

    284

    E. L. Fields-Black et al.

    plant communities (e.g., widgeongrass in brackish and smartweed and panic grasses

    in freshwater rice ﬁelds) that do not develop under normal tidal regimes in free
    tidal

    ﬂow marshes.

    At a mechanistic level, tidal ﬁelds worked because the dike heights were built
    to a

    grade above mean high water. The bed of the rice ﬁeld (i.e., the broad acreage
    where

    rice initially and not native plants were and are grown) was at a level above
    mean

    low water (Fig. 4). This enabled full dewatering of the rice ﬁeld because as the
    tidal

    river reached low tide, i.e. below the bed level, water from the tidal rice ﬁeld
    passed

    through water control structures from the rice ﬁeld and into the free tidal ﬂow
    water

    bodies.

    Sea level rise impacts are most visible in coastal communities. The impacts of

    more frequent ﬂooding on tourist and beach communities are commonly reported

    in the media (Tibbetts and Mooney 2018; Cappucci 2020). Additionally, sea level

    rise also inﬂuences tidal amplitude inland along tidal rivers. In South Carolina,
    these

    river systems are typiﬁed by the Combahee, Ashepoo, Edisto and Santee Rivers.

    Coastal South Carolina has seen a signiﬁcant increase in tide levels. Since 1950,

    tidal waters have increased 10 inches in Charleston, which is central along the
    coast

    to rice growing areas of SC (Anonymous 2019, 6). Additionally, this increase appears

    to be increasing to a point where tidal increases of 1 inch every 2 years is anticipated.

    These dramatic statistics within the tidal rice ﬁeld landscape are forcing

    landowners to think of how increasing mean high water marks interact with the
    grade

    of perimeter dikes. Indeed, increasing numbers of spring tides, i.e. the strongest
    tide

    of the lunar cycle, are now overtopping these perimeter dikes. Efforts to raise
    them

    Fig. 4 Cross section sketch of a tidal rice ﬁeld bed, canal and perimeter and
    dike. Tidal amplitudes

    during the era of rice ﬁeld development (i.e., late 1700s until mid 1800s). MLW
    level is at a point

    below the rice ﬁeld bed such that water could easily pass from the tidal rice
    ﬁeld into the tidal

    rivers. Sea level rise in the late twentieth and current twenty-ﬁrst century have
    shifted this tidal

    amplitude up such that MLW levels are just below or at bed level and thereby making
    it difﬁcult to

    fully dewater tidal rice ﬁelds for wildlife habitat management objectives

    Resilience of Coupled Socio-Ecological Systems: Historic Rice Fields …

    285

    are ongoing on rice plantations. In fact, because of the increasing mean high
    water,

    efforts to raise dike levels over the last decade are ongoing in all areas of
    tidal rice

    ﬁelds across South Carolina.

    However, there is another more difﬁcult dynamic associated with the increased

    tidal amplitude. Increasingly managers of tidal rice ﬁelds have difﬁculty fully
    dewa-

    tering the ﬁelds during low tide periods because the mean low water mark has also

    increased over time. Thus, the time and potential of water to pass from the tidal
    rice

    ﬁeld and into the tidal river is limited. Because these tidal ﬁelds are managed
    for

    wildlife habitat and because many of the native plants require periods of drying
    to the

    bed, the management focus for wildlife is becoming more difﬁcult. Some plantations

    have installed mechanical pumping stations to ameliorate the impact of increasing

    mean low water marks, but this cost is additive to the cost of dike maintenance
    and

    retopping.

    Climatechangehas alsoimpactedthefrequencyof tropical stormevents (Marsooli

    et al. 2019, 5). Coastal South Carolina has seen these impacts recently with nine

    tropical storms events impacting coastal South Carolina since 2016 (Mizzell et
    al.

    2020, 12). Luckily, there is a trend for the increased tropical storm events to
    be

    storms with less intensity than in the past; however, these events lead to excessive

    ﬂooding from rainfall and tidal surge. Both sources of excess water in tidal rivers

    cause excessive dike erosion, dike breaching, and loss of water control structures.
    In

    recent years, some plantations have performed these dike repairs between hurricane

    seasons only to be forced into the same repair the next year caused by another
    storm.

    Tidal rice ﬁelds are more susceptible to these impacts than inland ﬁelds for two

    reasons. First, tidal ﬁelds are directly adjacent to tidal rivers and creeks.
    Therefore

    they are immediately impacted by increases in tidal amplitude and storm surge
    as a

    result of tropical storm events. In contrast, inland ﬁelds are insulated by geography

    fromtheseimpacts;however,intenseraineventscancauseexcessiveﬂoodingthrough

    the system, which degrades dikes and water control structures. In general, the
    cost

    of maintenance of tidal ﬁelds versus inland ﬁelds is 1.5–2 times higher (per acre

    of managed wetland). One complicating factor though is that more tidal ﬁelds than

    inland ﬁelds are still actively maintained and managed for wildlife habitat.

    There are few absolutes when dealing with environmental forces. One is that

    man is rarely successful in engineering solutions that will completely ameliorate
    the

    impacts on an anthropogenic landscape. So why then do owners and managers of

    tidal rice ﬁelds continue to repair and maintain these systems in the face of
    increasing

    pressures? What are the alternatives to the tidal rice ﬁeld system for wildlife
    habitat

    management? What are the societal forces that would entrain owners and managers

    to continue to repair tidal rice ﬁelds versus move back to inland ﬁelds where
    restoring

    dikes, canals, and water control structures is easier and less costly per acre?
    All of

    these questions are being considered informally across the coast of South Carolina.

    Historically, real estate values have been the motivators for persistence in main-

    taining and repairing tidal ﬁelds through the recent impacts of increases in tidal

    amplitude and storm frequency. Tidal rice ﬁelds, when well managed for wildlife,

    can be valued at $8000 to $10,000 per acre. These values are signiﬁcant when consid-

    ering some tidal ﬁelds are hundreds of acres. The value of tidal ﬁelds where the
    dikes

    286

    E. L. Fields-Black et al.

    not intact and management not possible would diminish to approximately $250 per

    acre. Furthermore, the overall real estate of many of these plantations exists
    because

    of the presence of functional tidal rice ﬁelds on the property. Would land owners

    be willing to pay these prices if the tidal ﬁelds were not functional (i.e., dikes
    are

    breached, water control structures are not present)?

    The attractiveness of the habitat to wildlife itself must also be considered in
    the

    question of tidal versus inland rice ﬁelds. In general, many water birds (waterfowl

    and other species) typically do not use the area of habitat in close proximity
    to the

    dike infrastructure. There is a band that surrounds these dikes where the habitat
    may

    be suitable, but wildlife do not use it with as great a frequency as the interior
    of these

    wetland units. This dynamic has not received much research, but it is hypothesized

    that water birds avoid dikes due to the disturbance of travel across the dikes.

    Many acres are still accessible to water birds in a squarish-conﬁguration of

    hundreds of acres of tidal rice ﬁelds. This is in contrast to inland ﬁelds that
    tend to be

    narrow and long. Might many inland ﬁelds be too narrow to allow full habitat utiliza-

    tion by wildlife without the hypothesized perimeter disturbance effect? Research
    on

    this has not been conducted but would be useful in better understanding how transi-

    tioning ﬁnancial and logistical resources away from tidal and into inland ﬁelds
    might

    succeed.

    Conclusion

    Change is certain, whether it be social or ecological and often the two co-mingle
    and

    affect one another. Unlike the white rice ﬁeld planters of the antebellum southern

    U.S., who were unable to envisage any other stable state, contemporary society
    must

    attempt to project future changes and evaluate mitigating solutions to possible
    risks.

    Historic rice ﬁelds, as a social-environmental system, are facing multiple changes

    due to climate change. As such, they are a prime case for evaluating society’s
    ability

    to consider alternative scenarios where current social and environmental functions

    may change but large scale changes, or even functional loss, may be ameliorated.
    In

    this light, many stakeholder groups who are part invested in the socio-environmental

    system of historic rice ﬁelds are confronted with deciding how and if they should
    deal

    with increased sea levels and tropical storm activity. Understanding the magnitude

    of impacts and the nature of the resource lost to climate change is a wise ﬁrst
    step in

    evaluating the type of mitigating response.

    In the case of rice ﬁelds, we know their historical signiﬁcance, their place in
    the

    cultural fabric of coastal South Carolina, and their importance as valuable wildlife

    habitat. How can these components of historic rice ﬁelds, or potentially a subset

    of these components, be maintained given the impending threats? Several questions

    come to mind: (1) What, of the socio-environmental attributes of the rice ﬁelds,

    should be the focus of conservation efforts?, (2) What are the possible implications

    of conserving one attribute while forgoing conserving another (i.e., what does
    a new

    alternate stable state look like?), (3) Who decides what attribute(s) to conserve?,
    (4)

    Resilience of Coupled Socio-Ecological Systems: Historic Rice Fields …

    287

    What effect will possible changes in the environmental system have on the social

    system and vice-versa?, (5) What potential means are available to achieve conserva-

    tion of the decided upon attributes to be conserved? These are not easy questions
    to

    answer given the complexity of either the social or environmental systems as sepa-

    rate entities, let alone when attempting to consider them as a single co-mingled
    and

    interacting system.

    As a hypothetical example, it may be possible to shift the ecological function
    of

    the threatened tidal ﬁelds (due to sea level rise and increased tropical storm
    activity)

    to inland ﬁelds. In this example, inland ﬁelds could be cleared of timber, tree
    trunks

    removed, the land leveled, and water retention and control structures and devices

    installed to reclaim the forested land to its former rice ﬁeld structure. As the
    struc-

    ture of tidal ﬁelds changes and presumably functional loss occurs, the hope would

    be for these reclaimed inland ﬁelds to take on the structure and function of tidal
    rice

    ﬁelds. If this were to be successful, it would increase the resilience of the
    ecological

    system; however, there are likely cascading effects to the social system that
    must be

    considered. The loss of structure and function of the tidal ﬁelds, where the primary

    focus is on waterfowl hunting and their contemporary maintenance is provided by
    a

    relatively small group of landowners, will likely result in changes in the structure
    of

    monetary support for conservation efforts in the region. In other words, the structure

    and function of today’s tidal ﬁelds and the resulting large scale conservation
    activi-

    ties are primarily maintained by a small group of landowners. Without the available

    environmental structure to support waterfowl hunting, these landowners may forgo

    ﬁnancial support for conservation across the region. Shifting the ecological struc-

    ture and function of the tidal ﬁelds to the reclaimed inland ﬁelds will result
    in a

    different spatial arrangement and potentially different land ownership of these
    land-

    scape features. The owners of these newly reclaimed rice ﬁelds may have a different

    conservation ethic than the owners of the “lost” tidal ﬁelds. What might this
    mean

    for the ecological structure and function? How might this impact the societal
    system

    within the region?

    With inevitable change to both environmental and societal systems, some of which

    is foreseeable while others may not be, society should consider what the value
    of the

    various attributes of any given social-environmental system are, what maintains
    the

    system’s structure and function, what are the possible threats, however likely,
    to the

    various attributes of the system, and what the structure and function of alternate
    stable

    states might be. Such efforts should provide various scenarios where the resilience

    of socio-environmental systems is increased. In doing so, society will hopefully
    be

    able to promote wise use of environmental resources that meet the needs of both

    contemporary and future societies.

  explanation: 'The paper describes the "agropolitan" concept of integrated, environmentally
    sustainable urban–rural development where the primary goal is efficient use of
    water resources and enhanced agricultural productivity. The paper evaluates the
    current state of and future potential for such systems, focusing on the specific
    point in the outline related to providing user-friendly interfaces for farmers
    to input preferences, constraints, and expert knowledge into automated irrigation
    system management.


    The authors explore the example of the Chengdu Plain in China, a renowned agropolitan
    region that has supported over 2000 years of near-continuous urban culture and
    some of the world''s highest sustained long-term per-hectare productivity and
    diversity of grain and other crops. This system has historically depended on a
    relatively decentralized system of governance and the retention of significant
    autonomy at many scales down to the household, but rapid urban expansion has turned
    the region from a net grain exporter into a grain importer, and has radically
    transformed its productive functioning and distinctive scattered settlement pattern.


    The authors find that without the active efforts of NGOs, farmers, and other local
    stakeholders, many of the land use and morphological features that have characterized
    the Chengdu Plain''s resilience over the long term are threatened. In cases where
    housing has been concentrated into smaller footprints and residences have been
    replaced with non-nursery forest cover has decreased, and agricultural cultivation
    of edible crops has been replaced by higher-value but less labor-demanding plants,
    often leading to greater household debt. The authors suggest that some form of
    conscious intervention and social-ecological vision, such as community-supported
    agriculture and other initiatives that link agricultural producers to urbanites
    at a personal level, is needed to protect time-tested buffers and maintain flexibility
    in the face of disturbances, as well as to build new social relations appropriate
    to the increasing scale of urban society.'

    Metrics and citations Figures and tables Abstract摘要 The Dujiangyan irrigation
    system, China’s largest, is one of the world’s most important examples of sustainable
    agropolitan development, maintained by a relatively decentralised system of governance
    that minimises bureaucratic oversight and depends on significant local autonomy
    at many scales down to the household. At its historic core in the Chengdu Plain,
    the system has supported over 2000 years of near-continuously stable urban culture,
    as well as some of the world’s highest sustained long-term per-hectare productivity
    and diversity of grain and other crops, especially considering its high population
    density, forest cover, general biodiversity and flood management success. During
    the past decade, rapid urban expansion has turned the Chengdu Plain from a net
    grain exporter into a grain importer, and has radically transformed its productive
    functioning and distinctive scattered settlement pattern, reorganising much of
    the landscape into larger, corporately-managed farms, and more concentrated and
    infrastructure-intensive settlements of non-farming as well as farming households.
    Community-scale case studies of spatial-morphological and household socio-economic
    variants on the regional trend help to articulate what is at stake. Neither market-driven
    ‘laissez-faire’ rural development nor local state-driven spatial settlement consolidation
    and corporatisation of production seem to correlate well with important factors
    of resilience: landscape heterogeneity; crop diversity and food production; permaculture;
    and flexibility in household independence and choice of livelihood. Management
    of the irrigation system should be linked to community-based agricultural landscape
    preservation and productive dwelling, as sources of adaptive capacity crucial
    to the social-ecological resilience of the city-region, the nation and perhaps
    all humanity. Introduction As China urbanises, a key developmental policy debate
    centres on the question ‘who will till the land?’ (Hayward, 2017). On one side
    is a ‘grand narrative’ that favours agribusiness, based on economic models of
    urban agglomeration and various assumptions about the universal application of
    Euro-American techno-colonial developmental history. It envisions farm labour
    as wage-earning not land-owning; farm land as large in areal units; and farm ownership,
    investment and management as centralised in city-based firms. Opposed is a looser
    collection of positions that favour family farms or various cooperative arrangements
    and some form of local collective ownership. These positions share a concern to
    preserve peasants’ control over profits, land and their own labour; and point
    to the uniqueness of local places and histories. Related to this debate is the
    question: where will land be cultivated? The pursuit of agglomeration typically
    discounts the value of existing long-evolved, highly productive, tightly coupled
    urban–rural socio-ecosystems. However, even studies and policies that promote
    sustainability, social justice and food security tend to treat the loss of cultivated
    land to urban expansion as a challenge to increase the density and decrease the
    footprint of urban expansion, and/or to replace lost cultivated land with new
    cultivated land elsewhere (Angel, 2012; Webster, 2011). In China, the state’s
    presumed ‘ability to implement massive programs that can infiltrate every aspect
    of society rapidly’ is seen as key to achieving sustainability, by orchestrating
    on a large scale the necessary transfers of land use and applications of new green
    infrastructure technology (Liu, 2010: 50). This article suggests that the notion
    of agropolitanism, reinvigorated by the concept of resilience, provides an historically
    comparative way to relate local agro-ecologies to global urbanisation and the
    expansion of particular cities. Regionally specific spatial and historical details
    of a long-evolved tightly coupled human–natural environment challenge conventional
    definitions of both sustainable settlement form and efficient land use – especially
    in periurban areas with historically dense populations and traditionally high
    agricultural productivity. This functional approach to valuing historic features
    of settlement and landscape form focuses on agro-ecological communities’ spatial
    resilience (Cumming, 2011a, 2011b), to understand how specific morphological attributes
    at different scales have enabled systems to adapt and persist at particular moments
    of historical crisis or disturbance. The article presents a case of resilient
    agropolitanism in China: the Chengdu Plain in Sichuan and its associated Dujiangyan
    irrigation system. Morphologically, the landscape is distinguished by the irrigation
    system’s near absence of dams and levees, as well as a peculiar dispersed-but-densely-populated
    pattern of settlement, consisting of small clusters of forest-and-bamboo-shaded
    dwellings called linpan, rather than the nucleated villages typical of other densely
    populated, high-yield agricultural landscapes. The mechanisms of resilience in
    this system, and the historical crises that tested them, have been described by
    this author and his collaborators elsewhere (Whiting et al., 2019). This article
    frames the contemporary global significance of the case; focuses on the attributes
    that seem to have persisted; discusses how rapid urban expansion and agricultural
    land use restructuring now affects them; and finally reflects on what functions
    they may continue to serve at various scales of environmental and socio-cultural
    change, from the household to the region and perhaps beyond. Field research by
    the author and his local and international collaborators and students since 2010,
    as well as other published empirical studies simultaneously underway in the region,
    help to characterise the impacts of current development in the Plain. Original
    findings are drawn from collaborations led by the University of Washington and
    Sichuan University in coordination with the Chengdu Municipal Urban–Rural Planning
    Bureau’s Rural Planning Section in 2012–2014, and in coordination with the Sandaoyan
    Town government, Pidu District (formerly Pi County), in 2017–2018. The research
    involved: informal individual or small-group interviews and discussions with official
    planners at the municipal and town levels, governmental leaders at the town and
    village levels and with villagers themselves; surveys and mapping of land use,
    land cover and settlement form; household questionnaire surveys; academic planning
    and design studios to envision possible futures; and academic workshops with researchers,
    professionals, activists and officials. Rather than report this work comprehensively
    and in detail – much of it is described more fully in student theses and reports
    cited below – this article presents agropolitanism and resilience as a two-fold
    framework for interpreting the broad challenges and opportunities of urban expansion
    in China and other populous, long-settled and highly food-productive regions;
    and then highlights key findings from Chengdu to describe the socio-ecological
    significance of agrarian landscape and settlement morphology in those contexts.
    Agropolitanism, resilience and China: New and not-so-new challenges to urban agglomeration
    economies In 1985, John Friedmann himself ‘revisited’ the concept of agropolitanism
    he and Mike Douglass defined in 1978 as a countervailing vision to the dominant
    development strategy in the World Bank and Asian non-Communist nations, which
    concentrated investments in industry and urban ‘growth poles’ (Friedmann, 1979,
    1981, 1985; Friedmann and Douglass, 1978). Measured in GNP, this strategy succeeded,
    but it also exacerbated income disparities and unhealthy forms of political-economic
    dependency within and between nations, devalued and de-territorialised agricultural
    labour and led to increased population density and concentrations of poverty in
    rural areas, as well as widespread environmental degradation (Friedmann, 1985:
    177–183). The agropolitan alternative acknowledged the special problems of urbanisation
    in densely populated, intensively cultivated, agriculturally productive city-regions.
    It proposed to re-focus investment on rural communities and agriculture, under
    a decentralised system of self-governing territories and a greater degree of communal
    control over farmland. Counter to agglomeration economics, agropolis (‘city-in-the-fields’)
    emphasised domestic food self-sufficiency and protection of domestic small-scale
    labour-intensive and smallholder production against competition from international
    large-scale capital-intensive enterprise. It involved a re-balancing of ‘life
    space’ with ‘economic space’, and territorial values with globally integrative
    ones (Friedmann, 1988: Ch. 2), and envisioned: a system of governance and planning
    that is ecologically specific … in which effective power for decisions is devolved
    to agropolitan districts to enable them to take advantage of ecological opportunities
    where they exist (while being mindful of ecological constraints), to harness the
    richly personal, embodied learning of local inhabitants to the more formal, abstract
    knowledge of specialists … and to encourage a growing sense of identification
    of local people with the enlarged communal space of the agropolis. (Friedmann,
    1985: 184) Friedmann’s articulation of agropolitanism aligns with the concept
    of social-ecological resilience in the following respects: it advocated the appropriate
    matching of scales of decision-making and regulation to the environmental scales
    of their impact (Cumming et al., 2006; Ostrom, 1990); accommodating diversity
    and ensuring a degree of modularity at various scales (Scheffer et al., 2012);
    acknowledging the importance of buffers against disturbance (Walker and Salt,
    2006); and strengthening self-organisation, social learning and ‘tight’ feedback
    mechanisms (Scott, 2013). Since the 1980s, the ecological aspects of the agropolitan
    vision have only gained relevance due to the greater awareness of climate change,
    geohazards and loss of biodiversity, and overall area of agricultural land (Alberti,
    2016; Bren d’Amour et al., 2017; Cabell and Oelofse, 2012). China held a special
    place in the formation of the agropolitan vision. Up until the 1980s, a number
    of features of China’s development were particularly inspiring to agropolitanism’s
    proponents: the country’s long history of integrated governance of cities and
    countryside, and then the Maoist emphasis on multi-scaled self-reliance and local
    food supply, local collective ownership of rural land, and investments in agricultural
    production and rural industrialisation (Caldwell, 1977: 109; Friedmann, 1985:
    182–183, n. 116 and 117; Murphey, 1980; Salter, 1976; Whyte, 2010: 2–3; You, 1981).
    Even after Mao’s death, policies of the first decade of Reform and Opening (1978–1988)
    accorded with the agropolitan principle that ‘to modernize an economy requires,
    as a first step, a strengthened rural base’ (Friedmann, 1985: 166). The central
    government also continued the strict policy to preserve arable land for national
    self-sufficiency in grain. After the 1980s, however, the country’s development
    trajectory diverged from this agropolitan path, and pursued instead a hyper-urbanisation-led
    growth through the 1990s. The degree of planned-ness of such phenomenal development
    at the urban edge is one of China’s most exceptional features (Angel, 2012: 108).
    By the mid-2000s the resultant ‘three agricultural problems’ (sannong wenti) –
    the degradation of: (1) rural incomes and social conditions for farmers, (2) productivity
    and value of agriculture, and (3) health and vitality of rural environments –
    became a major concern of central government (Shen and Shen, 2018; Whyte, 2010).
    Still, over the past decade, despite policies and programmes to reduce rural taxation
    and redirect investments into the countryside, macroeconomic policy remains focused
    on maintaining industrial output, extending urban infrastructure, increasing domestic
    consumption of urban goods and services, centralising governance and ‘recasting’
    rural landscapes and residents as subjects of urban consumption and urban planning
    (Abramson, 2016; Bray, 2013; Chen et al., 2017; Rosenberg, 2013). The imperative
    to achieve quick, visible results for local leaders resulted in massive expenditures
    on demolition and construction, disrupting social relations, trapping all actors
    in webs of dependency and precarity and inhibiting participation in communal decision-making
    by the mass of rural residents (Looney, 2015; Lora-Wainwright, 2014). China has
    become as important a focus for research on urban agglomeration as it once was
    for articulating agropolitanism (Au and Henderson, 2006; Leman, 2005). Official
    support for the consolidation of farms and corporatisation of agriculture also
    remains strong, as part of the administration’s broader ‘new-type urbanisation’
    (xinxing chengzhenhua) policy (Looney and Rithmire, 2016), and as a result of
    the large-scale, broad-brush implementation of the nation’s grain self-sufficiency
    policy (Zhan, 2017b). Agribusinesses involving a wide range of landholding and
    labour arrangements challenge collective land control and smallholder farming,
    and raise the spectre of a new class of landless rural proletarians (Zhang and
    Donaldson, 2008). The national policy to preserve a gross minimum of cultivated
    land has also led to an overall shift of farming away from the most fertile, water-rich
    regions (mostly around the major population centres) to lower quality sites in
    hillier, formerly forested and semi-arid terrain, in order to accommodate urban
    expansion (Jiang et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2017; Zhan and Huang, 2017). The increase
    in built land cover, both in rural settlements and at the edge of expanding cities,
    also impinges on key sites of biodiversity (Güneralp et al., 2015). Afforestation
    efforts, while showing gains on a national scale after decades of deforestation,
    are largely viewed as incompatible with traditional small-scale pastoral or agrarian
    practices (despite evidence to the contrary), and have also largely focused on
    economically peripheral environments unsuitable for trees rather than on restoring
    previously forested areas (Ahrends et al., 2017; Trac et al., 2007; Urgenson et
    al., 2014). In response to these challenges, the Chinese political discourses
    of ‘new-type urbanisation’ and ‘ecological civilisation’ provide at least a rhetorical
    space to (re)articulate an agropolitan vision of human flourishing. To reflect
    global changes that have taken place since the 1980s, including problems which
    the original articulation of agropolitanism did not identify, such as deceleration
    of rural population growth and the ‘hollowing out’ of rural communities, the vision
    needs to account more for rural households’ increased spatial mobility and diversity
    of income sources. All manner of flows – capital, labour, information, goods and
    services – have accelerated. The tasks of balancing these flows with territorial
    governance, revaluing agricultural labour and products, accounting for ecosystem
    services and strengthening or building community relations have all become more
    urgent and difficult. Those aspects of the agropolitan vision that describe an
    adaptive but locally accountable system of governance are especially relevant
    to this dynamic situation. This is what agropolitanism looks like: The Chengdu
    Plain’s agroecosystem in global and national perspective The places that inspired
    the agropolitan vision, and which offer the most potential for maintaining the
    world’s rice supply (Smil, 2005), are the urbanising wet rice-growing alluvial
    plains and deltas of Monsoon Asia. The Sichuan Basin is the only one that does
    not include an estuary, and is therefore unaffected by changes in coastline or
    water salinity. It is also farther from the sea than any other comparably extensive
    and dense centre of settlement in the world. As in these other regions, the most
    agriculturally productive part of the Sichuan Basin has densities exceeding 30,000
    pop./km2 in its oldest urban centre, Chengdu, and more than 1000 pop./km2 in the
    surrounding countryside, which also includes a long-established network of secondary
    cities (Figure 1).1 Thanks to the feat of hydraulic engineering at Dujiangyan,
    there may be no better poster child of sustainability-as-abundance than the Chengdu
    Plain, long known in China as ‘the land of heavenly abundance’ (tianfu zhiguo)
    and the land whose ‘people are distant from floods and draughts, and know no famine’
    (shuihan congren, buzhi jijin). Figure 1. Map of China’s population density by
    county, 2006, in relation to the Heihe–Tengchong Line, Sichuan provincial boundary
    and location of the Chengdu Plain. This area, the West Sichuan/Chengdu Plain,
    is the flattest part of the basin, stretching in a north-east–south-west direction
    along the edge of the Himalayan massif, and sloping from the mountains towards
    the south-east at a gradient of 0.4 per cent. The Plain’s ability to support a
    large population is famously attributed to the delta-like Dujiangyan flood control
    and gravitation irrigation system, built around 256 BC, and still operating today
    in a much-expanded area of about 6700 km2, including the central part of the Plain
    and beyond. The greater area of all rural counties and urban districts that intersect
    with the Plain amounts to about 22,900 km2 – a length of 250 km and a width of
    85 km – with a population of about 17 million, of whom about 7.75 million are
    agricultural, working some 7540 km2 of cultivated land (Sichuan Sheng RenDa, 2011).2
    The most densely populated agricultural communities have over 1200 pop./km2, with
    household farms averaging only 0.20 ha of cultivated land. Historically, population
    densities in rural counties on the Plain were higher even than in the urban core
    county itself, and as cities grew during the 20th century the rural population
    also grew, approximately doubling, and farm size decreased accordingly (Buck et
    al., 1943; Li, 2007: 460, Table 3). The introduction of hybrid crop types and
    chemical pesticides and fertilisers allowed yields to keep pace with the population,
    especially for grain, which increased by the mid-1980s to a yield of six tons
    of rice and three tons of other grain per hectare (Chengdu Municipal Bureau of
    Statistics, 2014.; Bramall, 1993; Willmott, 1989: 144). However, even before 1950,
    long-sustained grain yields in the Plain were already a phenomenal 3 tons/ha,
    produced on less than 60 per cent of cropland that also grew rapeseed, market
    vegetables, tobacco, opium poppies and a diversity of other crops and forest products
    for market or home consumption (Buchanan, 1970: 173, Table 6; Buck et al., 1937:
    33, 209, 211; Guo, 1993: 421, Table 21; Wilson and Sargent, 1913: 109). Compared
    with the Yangzi and Pearl River deltas – China’s two other regions with comparable
    productivity, population density, efficient near-closed circles of inputs and
    surplus outputs of empire-wide importance – the Chengdu Plain both was older in
    these respects by at least 1000 years and also retained this status long after
    those other regions either experienced the diminishing returns of agricultural
    ‘involution’ or shifted resources to urban industrialisation (Ellis and Wang,
    1997; Elvin, 2004).3,4 Nationally, Mao-era rural production and ‘green revolution’
    technology reversed many late 19th- and early 20th-century losses in grain production,
    but this gain depended on less sustainable practices of water and industrial agrochemical
    use, and came at the expense of biodiversity. Total grain production peaked in
    1996, and rice has declined by more than 15% since 1998 (Liu et al., 2005). Today,
    all of the historically famous naturally abundant (tian fu) regions except the
    Chengdu Plain face crises of ecological health and rural livelihoods, including
    the Wei River valley around Xi’an, the central valley around Taiyuan, Shanxi and
    the Yangzi delta (Xu Hui, 2017). Among China’s current most productive agricultural
    regions – the Pearl and Yangzi River deltas, the North China Plain and the Manchurian
    Plain – the Sichuan basin remains exceptionally diverse and patchy in the mix
    of cropland and natural vegetation, and in the mix of single-, double- and triple-cropped
    land, even with the application there of some of the same productivity-boosting
    agrochemical practices seen elsewhere in the country (Bramall, 1995; Li et al.,
    2014). However, the past 15 years of rapid urban growth, plus increasing relative
    profit margins for non-grain crops, may finally have made the Chengdu Plain also
    a net importer of grain for the first time in its history (Shi Ju Zhi Ku et al.,
    2014).5 Urban built area in Chengdu municipality increased five-fold between 1986
    and 2011, and four-fold elsewhere in the Plain (Yuan and Yuan, 2013). Cultivated
    land accordingly decreased, by 3603 km2 between 1991 and 2011 across all the municipalities
    that occupy the Plain. Grain productivity in the municipality of Chengdu peaked
    in 1998 at over 9 tons/ha, declined to 8 tons/ha in 2008 and then dropped precipitously
    to 6 tons/ha by 2013. In order to reduce the loss of cultivated land to urban
    growth, as well as to manage better the impacts of that growth on rural communities,
    Chengdu municipality piloted a number of innovative Urban–Rural Coordinated Development
    programmes (Ye and LeGates, 2013). These included increasing social and infrastructure
    services to outlying towns, establishing a system of rural planning offices and
    eliminating the distinction between urban and rural hukou for all Chengdu residents.
    The municipality also established a grant programme to villages for infrastructure
    and environmental management projects, economic development and cultural programmes
    determined through participatory budgeting (Cabannes and Ming, 2013). The agropolitan
    tendencies of these programmes, however, have been offset by many of the agglomeration-focused
    tendencies and associated problems described above for the nation as a whole (Sorace,
    2014; Wilczak, 2017; Zhan, 2017a; Zhang and Wu, 2017a). The most celebrated of
    the programmes was a transfer-of-development-rights (TDR)-like system to conserve
    gross acreage of farmland. The system required developers seeking to build on
    farmland to bid for ‘quotas’ of such land that were available through the creation
    of new farmland in rural areas elsewhere in the municipality (Wang, 2011b). Rural
    households would relocate from existing housing to more compact settlements so
    that their former house plots could be converted to new farmland, which could
    then be sold in the form of development rights to an equal area of land in more
    marketable locations, usually on the urban edge. The price of the quotas would
    cover the cost of rehousing the rural residents. The programme thus provided a
    financing mechanism for realising two of the ‘three concentrations’: concentration
    of agricultural land use and of rural settlement, which is considered to be more
    efficient for service provision and for residents accessing non-farm work, and
    also less ecologically impactful (Huang et al., 2013; Peng, 2015; Zhang and Wu,
    2017b). Such considerations, however, have not taken into account either the Plain’s
    existing exceptional density (despite its scattered settlement form), or the variability
    of agricultural quality in land; quotas are a standard representation of simple
    land area (Xiao, 2014). It also quickly became evident that the benefits of the
    programme to rural communities depended on a highly speculative real estate market
    in order to cover their costs. Pi County planned to relocate nearly 200,000 people
    from scattered house plots on nearly 3000 ha to new more concentrated settlements
    on just over 1173 ha – thus clearing nearly 1800 ha of land for new cultivation
    and capitalisation through the quota market (Pi County People’s Government, 2011)
    (Figures 2 and 3). This was almost all to be complete by 2016 and, as of winter
    2012–2013, 45 new villages were already built or under construction, to re-house
    nearly 60,000 people (Ye and LeGates, 2013: 267).6 Figure 2. Existing conditions
    land use map of Pi County, 2012. Inset in upper-right shows the municipality of
    Chengdu and its sub-municipal jurisdictions (counties and districts). Large, darker
    shaded areas are urbanised county seat or town centre developments, including
    industry and urban housing. The built-up urban centre of Chengdu is in the lower-right
    corner and to the south-east. Smaller, lighter-shaded patches scattered across
    the landscape are rural housing clusters, mostly linpan (Pi County People’s Government,
    2011). Figure 3. Plan for farmers’ concentrated housing estates to replace nearly
    all linpan dwellings in Pi County, 2012. Loss of cultivated land to urban uses
    and construction is only one reason for Chengdu’s reduced food productivity, especially
    grain. In parallel with Urban–Rural Coordinated Development, the region pursued
    an increasingly globalised market in agricultural and industrial products (Taylor
    et al., 2016). Per capita grain production in Pi County dropped dramatically from
    67.7 tons in 1994 to 17.9 tons in 2012 as agricultural production shifted to less
    fertile peripheral counties, mirroring national trends at the metropolitan scale.7
    The programme to swap new urban construction land for new cultivated land may
    have accelerated this shift. Even where land remains cultivated, grain and other
    food crops have given way to planting that is more profitable in the short run,
    though at the cost of topsoil loss and changes to irrigation use and field division.
    Urban development across China created a new nation-wide market in the early 2000s
    for landscaping plants; the Chengdu Plain was an ideal hothouse-like environment
    for nurseries of trees and shrubs grown from seed or cuttings, or transplanted
    in their maturity from surrounding forests, to await further transplantation to
    cities near and far. Pi County became the prime location for nurseries, which
    require less labour input than rice and which have replaced many paddy fields.
    In 2010, Pi County also became the site for China’s westernmost factory of the
    Taiwan-based Foxconn corporation, the producer of Apple iPads and iPhones (Ngai
    and Chan, 2012). The factory and its associated Living Zone represented the largest
    foreign direct investment in Chengdu to that date, and required the demolition
    of 14 villages – a project actively promoted by higher-level government to spur
    further FDI. The Foxconn plant is emblematic of the kind of investment prize that
    growth poles are supposed to attract on their way to becoming world cities themselves:
    high-value, large-scale, capital-intensive manufacturing enterprises dependent
    on distant corporate control centres. Nevertheless, for another six years following
    the construction of the plant, Pi County remained a rural administrative territory.
    It was the closest county to the centre of Chengdu; neighbouring Wenjiang, whose
    agricultural fertility was historically considered second only to Pi County’s,
    had already been an urban district for seven years. In 2016, Pi County finally
    re-incorporated as Pidu District. For all these reasons, Pi County (hereafter
    referred to as Pidu District or Pidu) is the epicentre of the tension between
    the Chengdu Plain’s agropolitan and growth-pole functions. Pidu is the focus for
    the field research whose findings inform the following section, which examines
    at a smaller scale some of the impacts of recent developments on the Plain’s most
    essential elements of abundance and resilience. For our purposes, these include
    less the hydraulic system itself and more the downstream landscape of integrated
    water channels, fields and scattered woods-and-house-lot configurations. A clearer
    understanding of these impacts will help determine whether Chengdu’s Urban–Rural
    Coordinated Development policies reflect a drive primarily towards agropolis or
    metropolis, and if the latter, what opportunities exist to preserve, recover or
    reinvent agropolis in the Chengdu Plain. The Dujiangyan irrigation system and
    the linpan landscape as interconnected sources of resilience One of the great
    paradoxes of the Dujiangyan irrigated landscape is that it comprises China’s finest-grained
    land and water management system within its largest irrigation district. ‘Fine-grained’
    in this case means that a significant level of decision-making power is devolved
    onto individual households, even as collective decision-making and self-organisation
    exist at many levels matching the scale of decisions’ collective impact, as described
    by Ostrom (1990) for sustainable governance of common pool resources such as irrigation
    water. There are two components to land-water management in the Chengdu Plain:
    the flood-control and irrigation system itself, and the dispersed spatial form
    of agricultural settlement and production. The Dujiangyan system famously relies
    on dredging and guiding rather than dyking and damming, dispersing the water through
    a multi-levelled network of channels that ramify capillary-like across the plain
    – a ‘soft’ approach that correlates both with ancient Daoist philosophy and the
    most current flood-risk management thinking around the world (Needham et al.,
    1971: 249–250, 288–296; Wesselink et al., 2016).8 While the headworks and main
    branches required massive corvée labour and significant large-scale coordination
    at certain regular times of the year, most of the time the system can be maintained
    at highly local levels, even within a short distance of individual farmhouses
    (Wang, 2011a; Willmott, 1989; Yuan, 2016). Without levees to contain the water,
    moreover, localised flooding and the channels that feed the fields regularly recharge
    soil fertility with new silt (Richardson, 1945: 9). Most importantly, unlike dykes
    and levees, failures in the channelised system would not have widespread impacts.
    By comparison, the long-sustained successful dyke-and-polder-based systems of
    the Yangzi, Pearl and Red River deltas depended on a larger scale of mutual oversight
    and a deeper sense of unity, lest the negligence of one family bring disaster
    to many more (Elvin, 2004: 118). The communitarian solidarity required to maintain
    polders in the Yangzi and Pearl deltas is supported by the more nucleated spatial
    form of villages in those regions. In the Chengdu Plain, the more localised and
    distributed management appropriate to the channelised water system correlates
    with a more independent form of dwelling known as linpan or ‘wooded lot’ (Duan
    and Liu, 2004). The dwelling includes a U- or L-shaped house surrounding a courtyard
    for drying grain, which is surrounded in turn by part of a water channel and a
    grove of various trees and bamboo, each useful in a variety of ecological, microclimatic
    and productive ways. The bamboo, for example, provides shade and material for
    implements and construction, and through the accumulation of its fallen leaves
    over time it creates a small dyke around the home to protect against flooding.
    Linpan dwellings are as individually integrated with natural processes and the
    productive landscape as human habitation can be. They are sited in an infinite
    variety of arrangements, either singly or in clusters of various sizes, with usually
    not more than nine or ten households nearer the centre of the irrigated area in
    Pidu District, and gradually containing more households towards the edges of the
    system. They are sited at various distances, but usually among the fields rather
    than along roads, canals or around markets (Fang and Zhou, 2011). The linpan are
    thus essential elements of the Plain’s permacultural productivity: the lush biodiversity,
    patchy field mosaic and remarkable degree of forest cover that has impressed well-travelled
    visitors to the Plain for at least 150 years, even at a time when most of China’s
    densely populated landscapes suffered from severe deforestation (Bird, 1899; Shaw,
    1914; Von Richthofen, n.d.; Wilson and Sargent, 1913). The density of settlement
    overall in the Plain ensured that linpan dwellings were never far from each other
    or from markets, however dispersed. As Skinner (1977) described, social and economic
    life in the Chengdu Plain historically took the form of a spatio-temporal distribution
    of markets and multilateral networks of fraternal, temple and lineage organisations
    that integrated households with both the urban system as well as the natural ecology.
    Relative household autonomy derived from participation in the multiplicity of
    social organisations that balanced governmental power. This socio-ecological system
    contrasted sharply with the nucleated village systems of the North China Plain
    as well as the Yangzi delta (Huang, 1990; Huang et al., 1985: 64–66; Ruf, 1998:
    152). Although the Communist regime after 1949 eliminated most of the traditional
    non-governmental organisations that also played a role in land and water management,
    the fine grain of management that characterised the Plain’s agrarian communities
    has continued for most of the past half-century (Wang, 2011a). As throughout China,
    the size of administrative villages in the Chengdu Plain is determined primarily
    by the number of a village’s residents, not its territorial area, which varies
    depending on local ecological carrying capacity. Village populations are roughly
    consistent, mostly varying between 600 and 1000 households with 1500–3000 people,
    in 10–15 ‘villager small groups’ (cunmin xiaozu) or ‘agricultural associations’
    (nongye she), formerly the ‘production brigade’ (shengchan dui) of the Mao era.
    However, while these groupings in most intensively agrarian parts of China correspond
    with nucleated settlements, in the linpan landscape of scattered habitation, ‘village’
    is largely a governmental-administrative term. Village boundaries have little
    agro-ecological meaning; they do not correspond to watersheds, as is typical where
    topography is more pronounced, and they shift according to changes in higher-level
    bureaucratic–political organisation. The villager small group today is a more
    stable unit of collectivity than the administrative village. In the former Pi
    County at the heart of the historically irrigated part of the Plain, these groupings
    include 30–90 households, or 120–300 people, living on an average of 1.2 to 1.75
    mu (0.08–0.12 ha) per person, including all land for construction as well as cultivation.
    The exact size is determined by the numbers of population engaged directly in
    agriculture as opposed to other small enterprises, their households’ proximity
    to major roads and the configuration of fields, irrigation channels and linpan
    clusters themselves – but they generally reflect a consistent capacity for collective
    decision-making and hyper-local social leadership among families living with an
    unusual degree of spatial autonomy. Willmott, writing just before the region’s
    explosive urbanisation, suggested that bureaucracy and community in the Dujiangyan
    Irrigation District were not so easily distinguished as separate systems, but
    rather functioned in tandem resiliently because they were nested in scale and
    combined ‘centralized and decentralized political structures’ (Willmott, 1989:
    152–153). The scattered settlement pattern did not preclude large-scale collective
    effort, either for the traditional maintenance of the Dujiangyan headworks, or
    for the Mao-era construction of lateral canals and other projects that tripled
    the cultivated land area of the entire irrigation district, from 188,000 ha to
    588,667 ha, between 1949 and 1980 (Wu, 1983). The local planning policies to implement
    Urban–Rural Coordinated Development in Chengdu described above never recognised
    the interconnections between the linpan settlement form and the irrigation and
    flood control system. Governmental water management structure today essentially
    parallels practice over past centuries (Yuan, 2016). Management of the Irrigation
    District by the provincial Water Resources Department and its Bureau at Dujiangyan
    is a powerful operation that takes priority over many other affairs within the
    District, and is tightly coordinated with governance in local jurisdictions. The
    Community Party Secretary for each level of territorial administration is also
    the ‘river director’ (he zhang) for the section of each river and channel passing
    through his/her jurisdiction. The Dujiangyan headworks themselves have been protected
    as a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage site since 2000, even as they continue to
    be operated and maintained by the Water Resources Department’s Bureau there. The
    landscape of linpan dwellings downstream, however, does not have this dual status
    as cultural heritage and daily functional subject of governance. Preservation
    policy has lately treated linpan as characteristic of the region, but primarily
    in cultural and aesthetic terms. Despite official pronouncements urging linpan
    protection, policies and practices do not reflect their functional significance
    (Chengdu Municipal People’s Government, 2008). Some NGOs, most notably the Chengdu
    Urban Rivers Association (CURA), have been active in researching and publicising
    the relationship between traditional linpan-based ecoagriculture and the health
    of the water system overall. Official planners, however, generally view the scattered
    pattern of settlement as a hindrance to efficient infrastructure modernisation
    and farm consolidation, though they acknowledge vaguely that new village construction
    plans should reflect local conditions. The Chengdu Municipal Urban–Rural Planning
    Bureau’s Rural Planning Section therefore adopted a flexible principle of ‘concentrate
    where it is beneficial to concentrate; disperse where it is beneficial to disperse’
    (yi ju ze ju, yi san ze san). In order to help the Bureau understand quantitatively
    what ‘concentration’ and ‘dispersal’ mean in the context of the Plain, the author
    with students and collaborators undertook a comparative study in 2012–2014 of
    four broadly representative but sharply contrasting cases of agricultural settlement
    development in three administrative villages in different townships of Pidu District.
    The study proceeded in two phases: (1) a morphological survey in 2012–2013 of
    land use, land cover and settlement form characteristics broadly indicative of
    agroecological resilience (Kremen et al., 2012; Leitão, 2006; Tengö and Belfrage,
    2004; Van Apeldoorn et al., 2011), reported in Tippins (2014); (2) questionnaire
    surveys in 2014–2015 of household socio-economic conditions, reported in Xiao
    (2015). Additional perspective on these findings was obtained through field surveys
    and planning studio work in Pujiang County in 2013 at the hilly edge of the Plain,
    outside the Dujiangyan irrigated area but where the landscape is still characterised
    by linpan (Li, 2014), and through multiple subsequent visits and interviews each
    year since. In 2017, further morphological and household socio-economic case studies
    were conducted in an additional three villages in Sandaoyan, another township
    in Pidu. The quantitative data represent conditions only at one moment in time
    (the study was not longitudinal), and at a small scale (Table 1). In combination
    with qualitative data, however, they provide a relatively clear sense of trends
    and their determinants specific to these cases, and reveal important relationships
    between developmental projects and certain landscape and household conditions.

    On the most dispersed end were two cases: (1) a ‘laissez-faire’ case in Jiang’an
    Village where no planned reorganisation took place and households made conventional
    economic decisions on the basis of market signals and within the framework of
    their existing land rights and linpan landscape configuration; and (2) a case
    in Quanjia Heba, a riverside area within the administrative village of Anlong,
    where households engaged in organic urban–rural community-supported agriculture
    (CSA) partnered with CURA to actively preserve the linpan environment and restore
    traditional farming practices. At the opposite extreme of the spectrum was a case
    of village government-led corporatisation in Zhanqi Village, including demolition
    of all linpan and resettlement of all families in a single new concentrated housing
    estate, the reorganisation of villagers’ role in production as shareholders and
    employees of village enterprises and the enlargement and regularisation of fields
    to accommodate new technologies of cultivation and land use. The most extensive
    use of the reorganised village’s land was in rural tourism. In addition to concentrating
    residences into a smaller area, the new village’s design facilitated collective
    management and oversight. All the streets converged on a single entry plaza, with
    village government offices and services in a position of prominence. In contrast
    to either Jiang’an or Quanjia Heba, the leadership of Zhanqi village sacrificed
    traditional linpan household autonomy to pursue a collectivist form of ‘community
    capitalism’, as exemplified in the nationally-promoted model villages of Nanjie
    in Henan and Huaxi in Jiangsu (Hou, 2013).9 The project originated in the village
    leadership’s own initiative, and pre-dated the full roll-out of the municipality’s
    farmland quota market described above, though the village did take advantage both
    of that policy as well as regional policies for rebuilding after the 2008 earthquake
    in Sichuan (Abramson and Qi, 2011; Sorace, 2014). Between these extremes was a
    case of partial or ‘relative’ concentration in the rest of Anlong outside Quanjia
    Heba, where land rights and field divisions remained as before, but the village
    relied entirely on the quota market to relocate all families into multiple clusters
    of new, more compact housing on smaller footprints, and convert the abandoned
    linpan into new fields. The premise of redevelopment in this case was to keep
    households as the primary unit of production, but to concentrate residence as
    a way to improve infrastructure and social amenities. A complex relationship arose
    between Quanjia Heba and the rest of Anlong. The CSA’s fame at Quanjia Heba had
    helped to attract the attention and support of higher government levels to invest
    in the rest of the village, which initially was framed as a linpan preservation
    pilot project (Pi County People’s Government, 2007). However, the principle of
    concentrating housing, and dependence on the financial mechanism of the quota
    market, led instead to the replacement of actual linpan with a few aesthetically
    linpan-like larger housing clusters. Moreover, the project’s dependence on the
    quota market, and its high political profile, led supra-village leadership (the
    town and county governments) to take a larger role in the project, and village
    leaders played a more passive role in what was to became a showcase for the whole
    county. The initial spatial survey in these four situations suggests that, without
    the active efforts of the CSA and CURA, many of the land use and morphological
    features that have characterised the Chengdu Plain’s resilience over the long
    term are threatened (Tippins, 2014). In Zhanqi’s extreme concentration of housing,
    average field size (and therefore the distance between irrigation channels) was
    greater by about 400%, and the diversity of cropping, the ‘patchiness’ of land
    uses and the land and overall forest cover were significantly less. Even where
    concentration was only partial, in Anlong, non-nursery forest cover decreased.
    While extreme concentration did not necessarily mean significantly less cultivation
    of edible crops, only Quanjia Heba’s CSA grew grain along with vegetables and
    fruit, often in the same small fields. In the ‘laissez-faire’ case of Jiang’an,
    nearly all edible cultivation was replaced by nurseries, except for what families
    grew to feed themselves. In these two cases, the communities’ maintenance of the
    scattered dwelling pattern reflected a shared faith in the continued viability
    of household/family-based autonomy in economic and land-use decision-making. Even
    so, they differed sharply in the attitudes of peasant households towards markets.
    Jiang’an villagers pursued a conventional income-maximising strategy which led
    most families to grow higher-value and less labour-demanding plants, and to pursue
    wage-work for younger members outside the village, often at great distances. By
    contrast, CSA participants were willing to sacrifice some cash income to pursue
    an alternative ecological or ‘Buddhist-economic’ development model in conscious
    resistance to the pressures of urban agglomeration (Hale, 2013: Chapter 6; Hu,
    2015). Surveys of households in the four situations revealed that although household
    income was higher in both of the villages that underwent some degree of concentration,
    households experiencing partial concentration also incurred much higher expenses
    and debt, largely for furnishing the new houses. Among the two cases that left
    landscape morphology intact, incomes were lower and about equal, but in Jiang’an
    they were dependent overwhelmingly on ornamental plant sales (whose market value
    has subsequently dropped precipitously) and wages from labour in distant, low-skill
    jobs. Households in the CSA at Quanjia Heba tended to have more members who engaged
    in more than one type of work, diversifying their sources of income, and enjoying
    the most free time (Xiao, 2015). They had somewhat higher incomes than at Jiang’an,
    but also more expenditures, mostly for transportation and social activity related
    to the networking and product deliveries associated with their organic produce
    niche market. Such expenses represent a productive investment, reflected in their
    lower accumulated debt. Out-migration for wage-work among the CSA participants
    was at a lower level than in any of the other cases, including Zhanqi. The 2017
    surveys of morphological and socio-economic conditions in Sandaoyan compared two
    additional cases of ‘laissez-faire’ linpan preservation in Paotong and Qingta
    villages, and one case in Qinggangshu Village that combined Anlong’s semi-concentrated
    approach to new housing construction with Zhanqi’s more corporate approach to
    land use and its emphasis on tourism. Qinggangshu residents incurred significant
    deficits in order to outfit their new houses as nongjiale – independent rural
    tourism guesthouses – and had not yet seen a return on that investment. In the
    meantime they had given up all individual control over farm production. Paotong
    and Qingta, on the other hand, like Jiang’an, left the basic landscape structure
    intact and continued to use their land primarily for agriculture, but they maintained
    a more diverse mix of crops, including significant grain and food produce as well
    as ornamentals. Their household income profiles reveal further challenge to continuing
    resilience in the linpan landscape. Paotong villagers, relying almost entirely
    on food crops which they grew and marketed conventionally themselves, earned the
    lowest incomes. Qingta villagers, meanwhile, had gradually leased out much of
    their farmland to external enterprises; 80% of households had signed agreements
    to move out of their farmhouses whenever relocation housing could be built or
    found for them. How their original dwellings and linpan should then be used remains
    an open question. In terms of resilience, these findings suggest that the benefits
    of reorganising a community in the Chengdu Plain by destroying the linpan landscape
    will only accrue to its residents if the entire community undergoes a regime change
    – in this case, to become a shareholding corporation with all the administrative
    costs and loss of individual decision-making power that entails, as at Zhanqi.
    Also, these benefits – reflected primarily in higher household incomes and more
    convenient access to transportation and amenities such as natural gas and piped
    water – come with local and regional ecological costs and risks. Such costs have
    yet to be analysed, but the loss of fine-grained landscape heterogeneity must
    give pause, given its correlation with historically resilient levels of productivity.
    If, on the other hand, a community retains its traditional landscape and household
    autonomy only to pursue either fast-changing market signals or the most stable
    conventional markets, it risks increasing its vulnerability to external volatility
    and disturbance, or a gradual decline in earnings, as well as environmental degradation,
    as at Jiang’an and Paotong. The value of ornamental plants has dropped sharply
    throughout China since urban construction slowed after 2013, and yet converting
    nurseries back to paddy fields involves significant costs, including restoration
    of irrigation channels and replenishment of valuable topsoil lost when trees and
    shrubs are uprooted and sold. It would appear that some form of conscious intervention
    and social-ecological vision like the CSA’s and CURA’s at Quanjia Heba is needed
    to protect time-tested buffers and maintain flexibility in the face of such disturbances,
    as well as to build new social relations appropriate to the increasing scale of
    urban society – that is, in agropolitan terms, to ‘encourage a growing sense of
    identification of local people with the enlarged communal space of the agropolis’
    while maintaining multi-scaled autonomy (Friedmann, 1985: 184). Some recent changes
    in the policy environment of Chengdu appear to provide new time and space to achieve
    this balance in the surrounding Plain. As of April 2017, the municipality’s new
    Party Secretary Fan Ruiping declared a priority to prevent further urban expansion
    in the direction of Dujiangyan and redirect it to the south and east, towards
    the megacity of Chongqing (Zhang S, 2017). The prospect of a massive Chengdu–Chongqing
    conurbation to the east of the Plain presents new challenges to an agropolitan
    vision for the region. At the same time, the ‘Control the West’ part of current
    policy at least acknowledges long-term values in the historic heart of the irrigation
    district, between Dujiangyan and Chengdu. In August 2017, Pidu District announced
    an initiative to apply for Globally Important Agricultural Heritage status for
    its system of linpan and rotating wet–dry field cultivation (Zhang M, 2017). Since
    then, even touristic redevelopment in rural areas between Chengdu centre and Dujiangyan
    has been sharply curtailed, in the name of environmental protection and ‘ecological
    civilisation’. While still largely undefined, these initiatives at least suggest
    a more functionally meaningful direction for preservation and development policy
    in the Plain. Conclusion For all its dynamism, China’s urbanisation is taking
    place essentially in situ, at both local and national scales; Hu Huanyong’s Heihe–Tengchong
    line has hardly moved in over a century (Figure 1 and endnote 1). This means that
    the particular long-evolved social-ecological characteristics of each city-region
    are of special significance to the form those cities take as they expand. The
    spatial concentration of human settlement and the enlargement of land use patches
    is not necessarily the path to more efficient and sustainable production. The
    Chengdu Plain is certainly unusual. Such large and populous regions sustaining
    centuries of development are rare, especially on the basis of spatially distributed
    habitation and extremely fine-grained variability in land and water management.
    Nevertheless, it demonstrates that established forms of agropolitanism can persist
    and adapt, incorporating new forms of productive relations and values while maintaining
    function and identity. Residents of the linpan landscape today have abundant spatial
    and aspatial communicative access to urban amenities and economic opportunities,
    while maintaining local social interaction. Chengdu’s Urban–Rural Coordinated
    Development policies and programmes, including both the reform of hukou restrictions
    and investments in schools and healthcare infrastructure, have done much to reverse
    the previous half-century’s institutional barriers between rural and urban interaction.
    However, farming households still encounter discriminatory policies and market
    pricing that undervalue the abundant products of centuries of the world’s most
    efficient husbandry of soil fertility, water quality and diverse life forms. Without
    a pricing and regulatory system that accounts for these ecosystem services, reforms
    that regularise land rights and make them more fungible in a speculative market
    are likely to accelerate environmental degradation. Finally, the significance
    of ‘place’ extends well beyond a mere gathering of local ‘flavours’ touristically
    or speculatively attractive to a globally mobile talent and investment pool; it
    is rooted in a biophysical reality presenting a unique set of challenges and opportunities
    for human ingenuity, and a unique setting for spatial governance. Proponents of
    metropolitan agglomeration economies see ‘jurisdictional fragmentation’, of the
    kind that characterises the Chengdu Plain, as a governance challenge (Leman, 2005:
    26–28). However, effective governance for sustainable development is not simply
    a matter of ‘defragmentation’ of jurisdictions and ‘integration’ across them (Bren
    d’Amour et al., 2017; Güneralp et al., 2015). In rejecting the concentration of
    power inherent in urban agglomeration economics, the agropolitan approach does
    not by any means reject modernisation more broadly; rather, it pursues a modernity
    based in dialogue between scientific understanding of the biophysical implications
    of technological change, and ‘the richly personal, embodied learning of local
    inhabitants’, as Friedmann (1985: 184) put it. The Chengdu Plain’s long history
    of famine- and flood-free development suggests that a multiplicity of overlapping
    territorial jurisdictions, including those of both governmental and non-governmental
    but traditionally sanctioned organisations, and significant autonomy at the household
    level, contributes to resilience. Activities and organisations that link agricultural
    producers to urbanites at a personal level, such as those we observe at Quanjia
    Heba, need greater scope and government sanction to expand, replicate and participate
    in economic development and environmental management and planning. The key to
    sustainable land-use practices and decisions is not to exercise power at ever
    higher levels, but to strengthen mutual accountability and meaningful feedback
    loops between levels. Declaration of conflicting interests The author declared

    ORCID iD Daniel Abramson https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5070-8619 Footnotes 1. The
    importance of ecology in determining the pattern of urbanisation at these densities
    is demonstrated by the famous ‘Heihe–Tengchong line’, discovered by the geographer
    Hu Huanyong (Figure 1). The line approximately divides 57% of the land but only
    4% of the population in the western mountains, deserts and grasslands, and 43%
    of the land but 96% of the population in the eastern water-rich hills and plains.
    That proportion has hardly changed since 1935, despite phenomenal urbanisation.
    Sichuan Province is in all these respects a microcosm of China as a whole, with
    its highest population density abutting the line, in the Chengdu Plain. GO TO
    FOOTNOTE 2. Note that the municipalities to which these counties and districts
    belong also include counties in more hilly areas around the plain. These statistics
    probably do not count migrant population. Adding up the census population for
    each of the counties and districts separately yields a total of nearly 21 million.
    ‘Agricultural population’ is the ‘registered’ residential (hukou-holding) village
    population, including those no longer engaged in agricultural work and/or ‘temporarily’
    migrated elsewhere, and it does not include in-migrating farm workers with outside
    hukou. GO TO FOOTNOTE 3. According to the Han dynasty (206 BC–220 AD) census of
    the year 2 – ‘the earliest preserved census in the world’ (Bielenstein, 1987:
    14) – Chengdu was the second most populous urban prefecture in the empire, after
    the capital at Changan itself. Only the 10th most populous prefecture was in the
    Yangtze delta: Pengcheng, or Suzhou today – and it had only slightly more than
    half of Chengdu’s population (Modelski, 2003: 214–215). Chengdu has also remained
    remarkably stable in its rank among Chinese cities over time; none of the largest
    Han-dynasty cities remain among China’s 10 most populous city-regional centres
    today except Chengdu, at seventh place today, and Chang’an (Xi’an), which has
    dropped to ninth place. GO TO FOOTNOTE 4. The Yangzi delta began to import rice
    from other provinces, including Sichuan, as early as the late 18th century – long
    before any significant urban expansion (Elvin, 1973; Huang, 1990). GO TO FOOTNOTE
    5. Due to gains elsewhere in China, Chengdu’s share of total national grain production
    declined over a longer period, 1949–2012, from 1.13% to 0.43%, even though its
    population today is about 1% of China’s. Chengdu’s share of all agricultural output
    declined in the same period less dramatically, from 0.9% to 0.74% (Liang, 2015:
    21). These statistics are for the Municipality of Chengdu, not the entire Plain,
    but they are broadly representative. See below for intra-Plain agricultural shifts.
    GO TO FOOTNOTE 6. Further research is needed to know the current status of this
    plan. Interviews with village leaders and township planners revealed that even
    before the first phase of projects was complete, some villages declined to participate.
    The reasons given were that by summer 2014, a combination of overbuilding at the
    city’s edge and the central government’s new anti-corruption drive depressed real
    estate values, leaving villagers and local governments shouldering unanticipated
    debts after they had borrowed for construction on the expectation of receiving
    quota funds. GO TO FOOTNOTE 7. As a share of Chengdu’s total grain output, Pi
    County’s dropped from 8.29% in 1962 to 3.64% in 2012, while that of outlying counties
    Dayi, Pujiang and Jintang grew from about 6%, 3% and 8% respectively to 8%, 4.7%
    and 13.42%. Similar but more extreme trends characterised rapeseed production
    and pig-farming. GO TO FOOTNOTE 8. For more detail on the ingenious engineering

    related to providing user-friendly interfaces for farmers to input preferences,
    constraints, and expert knowledge into automated irrigation system management.
    The paper describes the Chengdu Plain in China, a renowned agropolitan region
    that has supported over 2000 years of near-continuous urban culture and some of
    the world''s highest sustained long-term per-hectare productivity and diversity
    of grain and other crops. This system has historically depended on a relatively
    decentralized system of governance and the retention of significant autonomy at
    many scales down to the household, but rapid urban expansion has turned the region
    from a net grain exporter into a grain importer, and has radically transformed
    its productive functioning and distinctive scattered settlement pattern.


    The authors find that without the active efforts of NGOs, farmers, and other local
    stakeholders, many of the land use and morphological features that have characterized
    the Chengdu Plain''s resilience over the long term are threatened. In cases where
    housing has been concentrated into smaller footprints and residences have been
    replaced with non-nursery forest cover has decreased, and agricultural cultivation
    of edible crops has been replaced by higher-value but less labor-demanding plants,
    often leading to greater household debt. The authors suggest that some form of
    conscious intervention and social-ecological vision, such as community-supported
    agriculture and other initiatives that link agricultural producers to urbanites
    at a personal level, is needed to protect time-tested buffers and maintain flexibility
    in the face of disturbances, as well as to build new social relations appropriate
    to the increasing scale of urban society.'

    of Sociohydrology as the Science of Coupled Human-Water Systems Megan Konar,  Margaret

    TOOLS SHARE Abstract Sociohydrology was launched as the science dealing with feedbacks
    between coupled human and water systems. Much of the early work in sociohydrology
    involved studies in spatially isolated domains (e.g., river basins) dealing with
    phenomena that involved emergent patterns in the time domain, with a focus on
    formulating and testing hypotheses about how they arise. The papers collected
    in this Special Section “Sociohydrology: Spatial and Temporal Dynamics of Coupled
    Human-Water Systems” illustrate that the scientific scope of sociohydrology has
    broadened over the last few years, with a rich diversity of phenomena studied
    and an expansion of the knowledge foundations and methodologies applied. These
    Special Section papers now incorporate methodologies and approaches from a wide
    range of social science disciplines, including anthropology, complex systems,
    economics, and sociology. The major themes tackled by these papers are understanding
    (i) water metabolism—the economic use of water; (ii) interactions between humans
    and droughts; (iii) interactions between humans and floods; and (iv) the role
    of human institutions, policy, and management. These collected papers provide
    a foundation for future research that strives to understand how to achieve water
    resources sustainability (society to water) and reduce the risk of hydrological
    hazards in society (water to society). Going forward, we suggest that the development
    of a common sociohydrology framework will be paramount for research development
    and student training. Additionally, increased engagement with the broader water
    management communities will enhance sociohydrology understanding and impact. Key
    Points The foundation of sociohydrology are the many emergent phenomena that arise
    during the practice of water resources management Sociohydrology studies benefit
    from the concepts and methodologies drawn from a wide range of natural and social
    science disciplines Increased engagement with the broader water management communities
    and the development of common frameworks represent important issues for sociohydrology
    going forward 1 Introduction The premise of sociohydrology is that our understanding
    of water systems is incomplete without the explicit inclusion of people (Srinivasan
    et al., 2016). Understanding and predicting processes in integrated human-water
    systems are challenging. This is because different disciplines, vocabularies,
    and perspectives must be synthesized (Troy et al., 2015; Wesselink et al., 2017;
    Xu et al., 2018). Bringing frameworks, theories, and models from different disciplines
    together is particularly challenging, as they typically operate at different scales
    (i.e., household vs. watershed), focus on different outcome variables (i.e., streamflow
    vs. welfare), and incorporate different scientific principles (i.e., mass balance
    vs. general equilibrium). Further, methods are grounded in different epistemologies
    and require distinct sets of prior knowledge for implementation. The papers collected
    in this Special Section contribute to this ongoing dialogue concerning the synthesis
    and a broadening of the scope of sociohydrology by showing how concepts and methods
    from different disciplines can be applied to study coupled human-water systems.
    In many respects, this is an exciting time for researchers involved in sociohydrology,
    as this movement toward consolidation and synthesis will likely open up more new
    avenues for thinking about and studying coupled human-water systems. 1.1 Sociohydrology
    to Date Much of the early work on sociohydrology has involved studies in spatially
    isolated domains (e.g., river basins), focused on phenomena expressed in the form
    of emergent patterns in the time domain. The analyses involved formulating and
    testing hypotheses on why these patterns arise. Examples include the levee effect
    as it applies to flooding in urban environments (Di Baldassarre et al., 2013)
    and the pendulum swing in water abstractions for human use in agriculture as opposed
    to water needed by the environment (Kandasamy et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2014).
    The adopted approach is to frame these systems in terms of system dynamics models
    involving coupled differential equations that depict the two-way feedbacks between
    human impacts on hydrology and hydrological impacts on human wellbeing (of some
    kind) and in this way are able to reproduce or reconstruct the observed emergent
    patterns. The key advance in these early modeling studies was the introduction
    of a social variable that reflected the mediating role played by human society
    in the two-way feedbacks. In the case of the levee effect, this was a social memory
    of floods (Di Baldassarre et al., 2015), and in the case of the pendulum swing,
    it took the form of environmental awareness (van Emmerik et al., 2014) or community
    sensitivity to the environment (Elshafei et al., 2014). Subsequent work has helped
    to broaden the theoretical foundations of sociohydrology. For example, Sivapalan
    and Blöschl (2015) helped to frame sociohydrology in the context of co-evolution
    of human and water systems (in the time domain), with explicit inclusion (i.e.,
    endogenization) of human agency in the form of changing human norms and values
    and more generally culture. They proposed a study approach of emergent phenomena
    based on narratives, causal loops, and the development and testing of models using
    available time series data. This opened the way for a diversity of studies organized
    by process sociohydrology, historical sociohydrology, and comparative sociohydrology.
    It was envisaged that a plurality of studies would thus be undertaken in a variety
    of contexts. The early place-based studies (in the temporal domain) were also
    accompanied by several commentaries and critiques that sought to broaden the scope
    and foundations of sociohydrology. There was criticism that much of the early
    work was dominated by hydrologists, using mostly hydrological (or natural science)
    methods, and that sociohydrology can benefit from tools and methodologies found
    in socioecological systems and complex systems literatures (Blair & Buytaert,
    2016; Troy et al., 2015). There were also critiques that warned that the field
    was moving toward theoretical studies divorced from real places involving real
    people. It was argued that instead of inferring the nature of human-water system
    feedbacks from historical (time series) data, these can also be obtained through
    field studies, through surveys, and other forms of data collection, with the goal
    of understanding human behaviors at a fundamental, empirical level (Mostert, 2018).
    There were calls for place-based studies in real places, with a greater involvement
    of social scientists in sociohydrological studies so as to expand the foundations
    of sociohydrology (Wesselink et al., 2016; Xu et al., 2018). Human-water systems
    occur at multiple spatial scales and operate in time (Sivapalan et al., 2014).
    As such, sociohydrological phenomena arise not just in the time domain but they
    can also arise in the space domain or in space-time (Chen et al., 2016). Pande
    and Sivapalan (2017) argued that the endogenization of human agency in terms of
    changing human norms and values must be extended to space and to space-time, as
    demonstrated already by Chen et al. (2016), since this is an essential prerequisite
    for water sustainability. Along the same lines, Konar et al. (2016) made the case
    for a broadening of the scope of sociohydrology toward the regional and global
    scales. They argued that sociohydrology extended to the global scale can serve
    as the blueprint to track both water withdrawal and consumption (which may be
    different in a globalized world), which helps toward the assignment of responsibility
    for the stewardship of water resources and the advancement of global water sustainability.
    The growth of the field of sociohydrology is also accompanied by calls for consolidation
    and synthesis that might lead to more general frameworks that would apply to a
    wide range of problems. This requires that sociohydrological studies be framed
    in the context of broad theoretical frameworks, such as water security and resilience.
    This would bring sociohydrology more aligned to and as a special case of older
    frameworks such as socioecological systems and thus benefit from the broad literature
    in coupled human-nature systems. The need for such generalization has long been
    felt, going all the way back to the very inception of the field (Srinivasan et
    al., 2012). There have been several recent commentaries proposing alternative
    frameworks to bring about such synthesis and generalization (Srinivasan et al.,
    2017; Lu et al., 2018; Sanderson, 2018). 2 Contributions of the Papers in the
    Special Section on Sociohydrology The last 6 years have been a period of rapid
    growth of the field, partly in response to these commentaries and critiques. This
    special section brings together more than 30 papers that reflect significant advances
    in our understanding of coupled human-water systems. In particular, they reflect
    a broadening of the scope of sociohydrology, not only in terms of the type of
    studies undertaken but also in terms of the disciplines involved. A wide range
    of methodologies is represented in this collection of papers, including the use
    of systems dynamics and agent-based models, multiple regression analyses, and
    field surveys. This indicates a certain broadening and maturing of sociohydrology,
    as also evidenced by a recent assessment of the co-authorship network in sociohydrology
    (Figure 1). In this section, we present a summary of the 31 papers appearing in
    this special section, organized under four categories: (i) water metabolism—the
    economic use of water; (ii) interactions between humans and droughts; (iii) interactions
    between humans and floods; and (iv) the role of human institutions, policy, and
    management. This is followed by perspectives on the way forward, guided by previous
    commentaries and conclusions drawn by the studies appearing in this Special Section.

    background. Figure reproduced with permission from Xu et al. 2.1 The Water Metabolism
    (Use) of Humanity Water is a key input to the economic production that underpins
    modern society (Marston et al., 2018). The papers in this special issue elucidate
    the important role that water plays in our society across a range of scales. At
    the smallest spatial scale, several papers evaluate the decision making of individual
    water users (Kuil et al., 2018; Mason et al., 2018). This grows in scale to papers
    that focus on urban water use (Chini et al., 2017; Worland et al., 2018) and to
    papers that explore water use at the national scale (Dadson et al., 2017; Dang
    & Konar, 2018). These papers highlight that the issue of scaling that has been
    the focus of much research in physical hydrology (e.g., Blöschl & Sivapalan, 1995)
    will continue to be an issue to consider in sociohydrology research. In addition
    to natural watershed boundaries, sociohydrology research must explicitly account
    for political boundaries. Mason et al. (2018) examine how hydroclimatic variability
    impacts the decision making of water supply operators. They incorporate a concept
    from cognitive psychology—the “availability bias”—into their modeling framework.
    Model results compare well with synthetic reservoir operation data for flood control
    and water supply. Their model successfully captures the operator''s preference
    selection across objectives and the dynamic evolution of extreme wet and dry situations.
    Kuil et al. (2018) present a sociohydrological model that captures a farmer''s
    crop choice and water allocation given his/her perception of water availability.
    They find that different farmer perceptions may lead to different crop patterns
    but also that similar, near-optimal crop patterns can emerge. The framework is
    consistent with the theory of bounded rationality, which assumes humans with limited
    cognitive abilities and imperfect information adopt satisficing behavior. The
    model by Kuil et al. (2018) also captures the rebound effect; that is, as crop
    water efficiencies improve, the newly available water will be reallocated on the
    farm instead of flowing downstream, since farmers will adjust their behavior to
    take advantage of the new water conditions. Worland et al. (2018) explore the
    drivers of municipal water use in the United States. Their results indicate that
    the most important explanatory variables are average precipitation, number of
    people per household, partisan voting, water price, and regional price parity.
    However, they find that the environmental, economic, and social controls on water
    use are not uniform across the country. Counties in the Northeast and Northwest
    climate regions are more sensitive to social variables, whereas counties in the
    Southwest and East North Central climate regions are more sensitive to environmental
    variables. This statistical analysis helps us to understand the current drivers
    of water use in cities of the United States and make better predictions about
    future water use trajectories. Chini et al. (2017) quantify the direct and indirect
    water use of urban areas in the United States. Their values could be used to inform
    future efforts to benchmark the use of energy and water resources in urban areas.
    In fact, they show that conservation opportunities exist for water and energy
    resources in both the direct and indirect supply chains of cities. Water embedded
    in the food supply chain of cities is the dominant indirect use of water and may
    represent a future opportunity to reduce the consumption water footprint of cities.
    Dang and Konar (2018) show that trade leads to lower national water use. To do
    this, they employ causal inference methods to determine that trade does not impact
    the total or industrial water use of nations but that it does reduce the agricultural
    water use of nations. They find that trade openness reduces water use in agriculture
    primarily through the intensive margin or producing more crop value per unit of
    water. Dadson et al. (2017) develop a system dynamics model that combine both
    the productive and harmful roles of water in the economy. This model shows the
    link between national wealth, water-related productivity, and losses from water-related
    hazards. Wealthy countries with minimal water-related hazards likely will not
    need significant investment in water resources infrastructure. However, wealthy
    countries that face significant water-related hazards should probably expect to
    spend a significant fraction of national wealth on water infrastructure. Poor
    countries with poor water endowments and extreme hydrological variability are
    most likely to descend into a low-level equilibrium or poverty trap, the location
    of which is controlled by local social and environmental factors. Their conceptual
    modeling approach provides important insights for the design of robust policies
    for investment in water-related productive assets and risk management. 2.2 Interactions
    Between Water Use and Drought Human activities from land use change and irrigation
    to dam building and water abstraction alter the propagation of drought through
    the hydrological cycle (Van Loon et al., 2016). In turn, drought impacts human
    activities, driving water conservation, shifting withdrawals from surface to groundwater,
    and prompting creative policy and infrastructure responses (Gonzales & Ajami,
    2017; Gonzales et al., 2017; Marston & Konar, 2017; Nelson & Burchfield, 2017).
    The papers in this Special Section characterize and quantify both drought propagation
    and response and the influence of climatic and social factors in shaping these
    processes. Apurv et al. (2017) assess the role of climate characteristics in drought
    propagation and the interactions of these processes with drought response. They
    test the impact of seasonality, the phase shift between precipitation and evaporation
    cycles, and aridity on the relationships between meteorological drought, hydrological
    drought, and groundwater drought. They find that the relative differences in meteorological
    and hydrological drought are explained by climate aridity and the timing of precipitation
    relative to potential evapotranspiration and that low interannual precipitation
    variability is associated with greater risk of drought resulting in groundwater
    depletion (Apurv et al., 2017). While Apurv et al. (2017) assess the climatic
    controls on drought propagation, Nelson and Burchfield (2017), Marston and Konar
    (2017), Gunda et al. (2018), and O''Keeffe et al. (2018) evaluate the influence
    of social factors in agricultural systems during drought. Both Nelson and Burchfield
    (2017) and Marston and Konar (2017) investigate responses to the 2012–2014 drought
    in California''s Central Valley. Nelson and Burchfield (2017) developed a spatiotemporal
    Bayesian model to assess the effect of water rights structures on agricultural
    production during drought. They find that watersheds with more senior water rights
    are associated with higher productivity during drought but that while junior water
    rights are more likely to fallow, their production is less sensitive to drought.
    This indicates that junior water rights holders have adapted to periodic reductions
    in surface water. One way they have adapted is groundwater well construction,
    confirmed by the work of Marston and Konar (2017). Marston and Konar (2017) investigate
    how the California drought''s agricultural impacts propagated through the global
    food trade system (see Figure 2). They found that while harvested area was reduced
    (due to fallowing), the water footprint grew due to rising temperatures and cropping
    changes. The reduction of harvested area led to reduced food commodity trade from
    the Central Valley. Surface water transfers also fell during this period, but
    groundwater transfers nearly doubled, strengthening the relationship between food
    trade and groundwater depletion. Figure 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Percent
    change in virtual water transfers from the Central Valley of California to the
    rest of the world over the course of the 2011–2014 drought. Maps indicate the
    percent change in (a) green, (b) surface, and (c) groundwater virtual water transfers.
    Arrows show the change in the volume of virtual water transfers (m3) and are scaled
    relative to size. Volumes are provided for the largest links. Red arrows indicate
    a reduction in virtual water transfers; blue arrows signify an increase. Figure
    reproduced with permission from Marston and Konar (2017). Gunda et al. (2018)
    and O''Keeffe et al. (2018) also focus on agricultural systems, investigating
    water stress response dynamics of an acequia community in New Mexico and farmers
    in Uttar Pradesh, India. Gunda et al. (2018) couple an acequia model, developed
    by Turner et al. (2016), to a hydrological model to assess the impact of upstream
    hydrological changes and downstream demand changes on crop production and migration.
    A unique feature of their study is that they evaluated the role of mutualism in
    sustaining the acequia during drought. They model mutualism as a function of community
    participation, which is in turn shaped by employment effects, parcel size, fallow
    land percentage, and the addition of newcomers to the community. They find that
    adaptive measures such as shifting crop selection allows the community to adapt
    to reductions in streamflow but that downstream pressures to reduce water use
    lead to decreased agricultural profitability. Parallel to the articles in this
    issue on flood dynamics (Leong, 2018; Sung et al., 2018; Yu et al., 2017), Gunda
    et al. (2018) demonstrate the importance of community dynamics in influencing
    community drought response behavior. O''Keeffe et al. (2018) presents the development,
    in a bottom-up manner, of a coupled sociohydrological model that captures observed
    farmer irrigation practices in the State of Uttar Pradesh, India, including two-way
    feedbacks between environment and farmer behavior. In particular, by including
    these feedbacks between the behavior of water users, irrigation officials, and
    agricultural practices, the work highlighted the importance of directly including
    water user behavior in policy making and operational tools to achieve water and
    livelihood security. Gonzales and Ajami (2017), Gonzales et al. (2017), and Breyer
    et al. (2018), in turn, investigate drought responses in urban areas. Gonzales
    and Ajami (2017) adapt a water demand model from Garcia et al. (2016) to assess
    the impact of changing scarcity awareness on water demand in three San Francisco
    area water utilities. The three utilities selected differ by average income, percent
    residential, and average per capita water use. They find that these socioeconomic
    factors help explain differences in drought response and postdrought rebound.
    Similarly, Gonzales et al. (2017) observe that the ease and cost of conservation
    may vary significantly. This motivates them to introduce a water conservation
    trading scheme and apply the scheme to utility members of the Bay Area Water Supply
    and Conservation Agency in California. Under conservation trading, utilities that
    do not meet their targets may purchase credits, and utilities that exceed targets
    sell credits in an auction. Gonzales et al. (2017) find that trading can reduce
    the costs of conservation by 20% and that coordinate decision-making increases
    the benefits for the utilities. Breyer et al. (2018) ask how water conservation
    impacts urban hydrological cycle in a study of Austin, Texas. They use multiscalar
    statistical analysis to demonstrate that the outdoor water conservation policies
    can cascade upward to the watershed scale or downward to the submunicipal scale.
    Together these studies highlight the importance of considering both feedbacks
    from drought to human action and from human response to hydrological cycle. 2.3
    Interactions Between Human Actions and Floods An important research topic for
    human-flood interaction is how human behavior and cultural traits evolve in response
    to flood events and how the resulting social change leads to shifts in hydrologic
    components that either mitigate or exacerbate floods (Loucks, 2015). Of special
    interest is understanding the feedback mechanisms that might explain emergent
    phenomena arising from human-flood interaction, for example, the levee and adaptation
    effects (Merz et al., 2015). An influential work in this direction is that of
    Di Baldassarre et al. (2013). Using a system dynamics model, the authors propose
    feedback mechanisms that can generate the qualitative patterns of levee and adaptation
    effects. This work has stimulated much interest and discussions in the field.
    One salient issue in these discussions is how to model the response of social
    system to the physical process of flooding. The papers in this theme focus on
    this linkage to provide alternative and complementary views to the approach used
    by Di Baldassarre et al. (2013, 2015). Yu et al. (2017) presents a system dynamics
    model of how an agricultural community mobilizes collective action for levee repair
    in the face of hydroclimate variability and nonfarm job opportunities. An important
    concept from the field of political economy is introduced in this work—institutional
    arrangements (rules and norms) for governing people''s collective action (e.g.,
    Ostrom, 1990). Institutional arrangements, which are rules and norms that humans
    devise to govern their behavior, can play a critical role in reducing uncertainty
    in complex, uncertain situations (North, 1990). Inclusion of institutional arrangements
    into sociohydrology modeling helps to unpack underlying processes of social response
    into (1) rules and norms, (2) behavioral choice toward such institutional arrangements
    (e.g., abide vs. oppose), and (3) situational factors that influence the decision
    making (e.g., social memory). Sung et al. (2018) explores how different societal
    policies on flood control influence long-term trajectories of human-flood interaction.
    The model by Di Baldassarre et al. (2013) considered only two policies from a
    myriad of possible ones: green society (no structural flood control) and technological
    society (raising of levees whenever flooding occurs). Sung et al. (2018) go beyond
    these two control policies by exploring the effects of several adaptive policies
    on community maintenance of levees. In doing this, Sung et al. (2018) apply control
    theory from engineering to conceptualize how a human society learns from flood
    events and adjusts its flood control policies (Figure 3). The same application
    was made in the field of social-ecological systems to analyze how a farmer-managed
    irrigation system dynamically adapts its water distribution and cost-sharing rules
    through learning by doing (Yu et al., 2016). Figure 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    A generic block diagram control system theory (a) is applied to conceptualize
    a human-flood system governed by adaptive flood control policy (b). The symbols
    di and do represent internal problems and external forcing, respectively. The
    circle C represents comparison between the current system state (current flood
    protection level) and desired set point (target flood protection level) for computing
    the error value. Inner-loop process involves control activities that are done
    to minimize the error. Outer-loop process involves updating of the desired set
    point. Situational factors such as social memory, community attributes, and climate
    change can influence the dynamics of such inner- and outer-loop processes in human-flood
    systems. Adapted from Sung et al. (2018) and Yu et al. (2016). Leong (2018) in
    this special section provides a more nuanced perspective on the levee and adaptation
    effects. The author goes beyond the dichotomous view of these two phenomena by
    arguing that (1) a heavy dependence on structural flood protection measures may
    not always lead to the levee effect and that (2) little use of structural measures
    and frequent exposure to flooding may not always lead to the adaptation effect.
    Leong (2018) exposes these possibilities by collecting and analyzing the narratives
    of people in several floodplain villages of India. Girons Lopez et al. (2017)
    and Du et al. (2017) focus on flood warning and evacuation behavior of people.
    Girons Lopez et al. (2017) developed a conceptual model to examine how the efficiency
    of flood warning is influenced by social preparedness, which is defined as the
    knowledge and capacities of a social system to proactively respond to a disaster
    (United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction, 2009). This work
    uses social memory of flood risk as a proxy for social preparedness. The model
    results show that a high social preparedness can affect the efficiency of flood
    warning system; that is, even if the warning system is inaccurate and the traffic
    network is congested, a high level of social preparedness can compensate for these
    weaknesses and mitigate flood-related losses. Du et al. (2017) developed an agent-based
    model to understand the coupled dynamics of public opinion and flood evacuation
    processes and how these dynamics are influenced by multiple information sources
    (global casting of flooding, social media, and observation of neighbors) and transportation
    system states. A key distinction of this work is reflecting the fact that individuals''
    evacuation behavior is not only influenced by the flood warnings from emergency
    managers but also by peer-to-peer communication through social media and observation
    of neighbors'' behavior. The model results show that social media can make evacuation
    processes more sensitive to changes in flood warning and neighborhood observation.
    Thompson et al. (2017) in this special section focuses on the link from human
    modifications of water resources to the physical process of flooding. This work
    uses a theoretical approach to investigate how the development lowlands affects
    the flooding of lowland environments and water balance partitioning. The model
    results show that modifications such as building levees and changing land cover
    can generate trade-offs among flood occurrence, flood duration, and total evaporation.
    Finally, MacVean et al. (2018) extended the work of Thompson et al. (2017) to
    reconstruct the hydrology of the 1850–1920 period for California''s Central Valley
    by synthesizing newly reconstructed time series of precipitation, basin inflows,
    land use change, and levee construction, using a parsimonious and semidistributed
    version of the model presented earlier by Thompson et al. (2017). Within the limitations
    of the reconstructed time series, their detailed analyses with the use of the
    model suggested that levee construction, rather than land-use change, had the
    greatest impact on the hydrology and that the decreases in annual delta outflows
    accelerated after 1920. 2.4 Human Institutions, Policy, and Management of Water
    Water management is the point at which human systems and water systems intersect,
    blurring the line between “human/social” systems and “natural” systems. The papers
    in this theme draw upon sociohydrological frameworks to provide insights into
    the institutions and decision-making processes that co-evolve with water system
    process to mutually shape water management. Water management may be informed by
    models, and traditionally, the focus of these models has been hydrological dynamics.
    Of growing importance, however, is how to more rigorously incorporate the human
    element into management of sociohydrological systems. Massuel et al. (2018) argue
    that traditional approaches to hydrology must become more open, and sensitive,
    to the human sciences. The social dynamics of human systems should be conceptualized
    as rigorously as the hydrological dynamics, but crucially, they contend that this
    will involve taking much more seriously the context-specificity of human systems.
    Their analysis of the Wadi Merguelil watershed and the downstream Kairouan Plain
    in central Tunisia shows that a conventional water budget modeling framework was
    not able to account for the many social factors that influence irrigation withdrawals.
    Instead, an approach recognizing the key role of cultural values allows researchers
    to better grasp the qualitative aspects of how humans interpret and make sense
    of sociohydrological systems. Their approach is skeptical of generalizable knowledge
    because of the site-specific dynamics that emerge from local interactions and
    that are contingent upon local cultural values. Because generalization continues
    to be a goal in sociohydrology, there is a real need to develop empirical frameworks
    that span time and space, while recognizing the context-specificity of human systems.
    Sanderson et al. (2017) take a step in this direction. Situated at the individual
    level, this paper develops a social-psychological model to explain policy choices
    among citizens in a semiarid agricultural region in the Central U.S. Great Plains.
    Here, again, values are important. Their analysis reveals how cultural values
    underlie belief formation and normative support for water management. Their model
    allows comparisons of culture-based decision-making processes among both farming
    and nonfarming populations in the watershed. These explicit comparisons enable
    researchers to identify areas of potential value-based conflict and consensus
    in water management. Another social aspect receiving greater attention recently
    is that of social position or, more broadly, the degree of stratification in a
    social system (Sanderson, 2018). Haeffner et al. (2018) explicitly investigate
    this question in the northern region of Utah, USA. Using a mixed methods approach
    involving interviews and surveys, they find that city leaders and the public differ
    in their concerns about water issues: leaders were more concerned about water
    infrastructure, and the public was more concerned with water availability and
    financial costs. Especially noteworthy is the finding that perceptions of water
    quantity and quantity are not merely shaped by the built structures and natural
    systems but instead are mediated by social structures—values, norms, beliefs,
    gender roles, and occupational structures. William et al. (2017) lend further
    support for the proposition that social position matters for modeling the human
    component of sociohydrological systems. This paper uses cooperative game theory
    to evaluate stormwater management approaches in the Gwynn Falls watershed, a highly
    urbanized watershed in West Baltimore, MD, USA. Among the key findings is that
    municipal-level regulation results in the largest reductions in pollutant loadings,
    but, again, context matters. The effectiveness of a regulatory approach depends
    on many socially contingent factors such as political, financial, and again, the
    distribution of actors'' positions within spatial stormwater networks. Taking
    the context seriously means considering it as an issue related to the scale of
    sociohydrological systems. Schifman et al. (2017) propose a framework for sociohydrology
    that attempts to enhance the adaptability of these systems by optimizing multiple
    functions and outcomes, including ecosystem services, spanning various institutional
    scales. They apply the framework to green infrastructure initiatives in Cleveland,
    OH, USA and Atlanta, GA, USA. The results demonstrate the model''s potential utility
    beyond these cases, while avoiding the pitfalls of a one-size-fits-all approach.
    Along these lines, Voisin et al. (2017) integrate a regional integrated assessment
    model with an Earth system model to better understand the effects of sectoral
    human actions on spatial patterns in water resources, focusing especially on feedbacks
    between the human and natural systems. The impacts of water management depend
    on scale, and sectoral human actions influencing groundwater use and water use
    recycling shape spatial patterns in streamflows and water deficits. Roobavannan
    et al. (2017) incorporate several of the key elements discussed under this theme.
    This paper assesses the pendulum swing hypothesis in the Murrumbidgee River Basin
    in east Australia. Economic diversification emerges as the key variable, reshaping
    cultural values and norms over time and shifting the balance of preferences away
    from agricultural production and economic growth toward environmental restoration
    and sustainability. The paper sheds light on how scale, social structure, cultural
    values, and water resources interact over time, co-evolving through feedbacks
    to generate emergent outcomes. Wescoat et al. (2018) use historical geographic
    and statistical methods to gain context-specific understanding of how and why
    measurements of water flows have been done in the ways they have in the Indus
    River Basin of Pakistan. They do their analysis in three levels of water channels:
    basin, canal, and local distributary levels. The paper demonstrates that the combined
    use of historical geographic and statistical methods can be a viable approach
    for conducting sociohydrology research. Treuer et al. (2017) in this special section
    provides a rich context specific analysis of how urban water utilities can transition
    toward more sustainable water management practices. Using a case of Miami-Dade
    County, Florida, they demonstrate that a better understanding of such a transition
    requires a data-narrative approach that systematically synthesizes quantitative
    and qualitative data sources, including local knowledge of practitioners and archived
    documents. Their analysis shows that the alignment of certain biophysical, regulatory,
    financial, and political conditions likely have contributed to the region''s transition
    toward improved water sustainability. One unique aspect of the study is the use
    of institutional analysis (analysis of rules and norms) based on government documents
    to understand regulatory factors influencing such a transition. Finally, Bijl
    et al. (2018) presented a model for freshwater scarcity assessment that integrated
    the impacts of future population growth, agricultural production patterns, energy
    use, economic development, and climate change on the global freshwater cycle.
    With such integration between hydrology and economy, the model was able to generate
    greater understanding of the competition dynamics between the different freshwater
    users and different allocation mechanisms, at the basin and grid scales. In this
    way, the application of the model enabled broad conclusions to be made about the
    effects of climate change and variability and water use efficiency improvements
    in irrigated agriculture on global water withdrawals and deficits. 3 Going Forward
    The papers in this Special Section employ diverse disciplinary perspectives and
    methods to advance our understanding of coupled human-water systems. In so doing,
    they have also contributed to a broadening of the scope and foundations of sociohydrology.
    However, a few major threads of research remain for the future. Our review of
    the papers suggests the following questions yet to be addressed: (1) How will
    people adapt to future water scarcity? (2) How can we better anticipate the hydrological
    impacts of human activity across scales? (3) What policies or infrastructure investment
    can best protect communities from flooding and drought? (4) What policies can
    promote water security and when is unsustainable water use “ok”? (5) How does
    the socioecological context shape the success or failure of these policies? These
    questions will be increasingly important to address in our era of global change.
    Challenges also remain in connecting sociohydrological science to practice, developing
    generalizable knowledge of coupled human water systems, and training the next
    generation of practitioners and scholars. 3.1 Connecting Sociohydrology With Practice
    Increasingly, it will be important for sociohydrology to engage with the broad
    community of water resources managers. One avenue to potentially accomplish this
    goal is by explicitly evaluating the uncertainty and sensitivity inherent in the
    modeling of the sociohydrology system of interest. As in any model, the relevant
    variables and mechanisms included depend on the research question and scope of
    the problem. Recent sociohydrology work aims to make all relevant sources of uncertainty
    explicit in a structured way (Westerberg et al., 2017). This assessment of uncertainty
    in system outcomes can help to structure dialogue with water resources managers
    and planners, as well as engage them in the development and process of the research
    (Westerberg et al., 2017). However, we also recognize that the nature of sociohydrological
    systems implies a different split between epistemological and aleatory uncertainties
    than pristine hydrological systems (Srinivasan et al., 2016). Engaging stakeholders
    in model development through structured dialogue, communication, and understanding
    about system uncertainty strengthens the research aspects of the model and also
    better integrates interdisciplinary communities and research with practice (Wesselink
    et al., 2017). While traditional hydrology or water resources management make
    predictions of future events based on past observations, sociohydrology addresses
    the prediction of novel phenomena to understand system dynamics and limits (Levy
    et al., 2016). Methodologies to account for uncertainty in sociohydrology should
    respond to the nature of prediction in sociohydrology (Srinivasan et al., 2016),
    and therefore, uncertainty assessments should focus on the evaluation of model
    structural adequacy and the ability to reproduce observed patterns and signatures.
    Sociohydrology and water resources system science are similar in that they consider
    both water and people and their mutual importance. The key distinction is that
    while water resources management focuses on how water resources can be better
    managed to benefit both society and nature by using multidisciplinary and participatory
    approaches (Kasprzyk et al., 2018), sociohydrology focuses on the complexity and
    emergent outcomes of human and water interactions (Sivapalan et al., 2012). Water
    resources management based on the assumptions of static human and water components
    (thus, insufficient recognition of the complex and adaptive nature of coupled
    human and water systems) can fail to deliver desired management goals (Vogel et
    al., 2015). Indeed, many of the phenomena that have been the subject of analysis
    in sociohydrology, and reviewed here, have arisen in the normal course of water
    resource management, as failures or unintended consequences (Gohari et al., 2013),
    due to some long-term feedbacks between humans and water systems not being fully
    accounted for. Thus, introducing and applying sociohydrology insights into water
    resources management can potentially be very useful. Similarly, insights from
    water resources professionals can help research to identify system constraints
    (in modeling) and real-world problems to tackle, making the research more impactful.
    This calls for more engagement between the sociohydrology and water resource management
    communities than has been demonstrated thus far. A parallel has, in fact, occurred
    in the fields of natural resource management and social-ecological systems research.
    Realization of the complexity and nonlinearity of interactions between social
    systems and natural systems that sustain them has challenged conventional natural
    resource management worldwide and led to the widespread acceptance of the concept
    of the social-ecological system into the field of natural resource management
    (Folke, 2006). As sociohydrology rapidly expands in the next few years, we expect
    to see a similar convergence to take shape between sociohydrology and the field
    of water resources management. Improvement of water management practices through
    a broadening to include multiple social, economic, and cultural perspectives,
    assisted by sociohydrology, takes on added importance in the context of the United
    Nations Sustainable Development Goals (United Nations, 2018). 3.2 Developing Generalizable
    Knowledge of Coupled Human Water Systems Going forward, it is likely that sociohydrology
    will interface with other nexus issues. Water is at the heart of many grand challenges
    for society, making it likely that water resources researchers may contribute
    to the intersection of water and food security, economics, energy, and/or biodiversity
    (Bierkens, 2015). In fact, a growing number of large-scale hydrologic models have
    incorporated human impacts on the hydrological cycle in recent decades (Wada et
    al., 2017). Yet the representation of human activities in hydrological models
    remains challenging and may prove to be a key opportunity for sociohydrology engagement.
    Questions also remain as to what features make sociohydrology unique compared
    to other interdisciplinary approaches and what sociohydrology might learn from
    these other approaches and vice versa. Further, challenges and opportunities remain
    in the development of common frameworks and general theories for sociohydrology.
    Frameworks usually specify a general set of variables, and relationships among
    them, that a researcher should consider when analyzing a case. A key benefit of
    a common sociohydrology framework would be that it will allow a structured and
    consistent comparative analysis of diverse case studies across contexts, thereby
    facilitating the discovery of generalizable patterns. A general sociohydrology
    theory can provide generalizable understanding of such patterns by clarifying
    how different case studies relate to one another in terms of causal processes,
    especially multilevel and multiscale processes associated with a sociohydrological
    phenomenon. Although most sociohydrology studies are already based on established
    theories that explain particular processes (e.g., rainfall runoff and expected
    utility theory), general theories that provide insights into common system-level
    aspects and multilevel and multiscale dynamics across different place-based studies
    are relatively scarce and should be pursued in the future as the field matures.
    Nevertheless, the papers in this Special Section take some initial steps in this
    direction. For example, Dadson et al. (2017) present a framework that connects
    water use and risk into an economics framework. Kuil et al. (2018) applied the
    theory of bounded rationality to analyze farmer crop choice and water allocation
    decision making, and Treuer et al. (2017) applied Triple Exposure Theory in their
    assessment of transitions to sustainable water management. Further, papers (Roobavannan
    et al., 2017; Yu et al., 2017) in this Special Section test and refine existing
    hypotheses such as the levee effect and the pendulum swing, contributing to theory
    development. Early sociohydrology studies focused on system dynamics modeling
    as the primary methodology. The papers in this Special Section highlight the breadth
    of methods that can be applied to address sociohydrological questions. Leong (2018)
    collects stakeholder narratives to illustrate how cases can illustrate aspects
    of both the levee effect and adaptation effect. Treuer et al. (2016) construct
    narratives and pair them with quantitative metrics to enable cross case comparison
    without losing the nuance of case context. Identifying feedback relationships
    across temporal and spatial scales is key to advancing sociohydrology (Thompson
    et al., 2013). The complex, hierarchical and co-evolutionary nature of sociohydrological
    problems requires careful selection and interpretation of data analysis methods.
    For example, while correlation-based methods (e.g., OLS regression, granger causality,
    and Bayesian inference) can identify linear couplings and their timescales, they
    cannot unambiguously identify the direction when relationships are asymmetric
    (Ruddell & Kumar, 2009). In this issue, the authors apply a range of statistical
    methods such as structural equation modeling (Breyer et al., 2018), hierarchical
    Bayesian modeling (Nelson & Burchfield, 2017), and regression with instrumental
    variables (Dang & Konar, 2018) to address these challenges. While Gunda et al.
    (2018), Dadson et al. (2017), Sung et al. (2018), and others continue the tradition
    of applying system dynamics modeling to gain qualitative understanding of system
    behavior, they advance this approach through their application of human system
    dynamics. One critique of system dynamics approach in sociohydrology is that the
    diversity of actors is not accounted for. Du et al. (2017) address this challenge
    by developing an agent-based model of flood warning and evacuation behavior. Collectively,
    the articles in this issue demonstrate the potential to synthesize multiple methods
    to increase the robustness of sociohydrological findings—critical to applying
    insights in practice. However, to address societal challenges, scientific findings
    must be salient as well as robust. Codevelopment of research aims and coproduction
    of research products can be an effective way to increase research salience but
    also introduce new challenges (Tidwell & Van Den Brink, 2008; MacKenzie et al.,
    2012). Multiple papers in this special issue solicit stakeholder input as data
    or use stakeholder feedback to refine analyses (e.g., Gunda et al., 2018; Leong,
    2018; Treuer et al., 2017). While past sociohydrology work has addressed knowledge
    transfer (e.g., Gober et al., 2014), no papers in this issue focus on knowledge
    transfer or research codevelopment, and more work remains to ensure that research
    efforts in sociohydrology can be applied in practice. Additionally, proper characterization
    of the uncertainties and sensitivities that exist in sociohydrology models must
    be explored to inform stakeholders. In this way, policymakers can be engaged to
    manage uncertainty—rather than reduce it—in a sociohydrology system (Gober et
    al., 2017). 3.3 Training the Next Generation of Practitioners and Scholars Future
    education and training of scholars and practitioners equipped to tackle outstanding
    questions in this field will be critical. A key question for the field is to determine
    if the training of researchers should shift or broaden to tackle sociohydrological
    challenges or if the training should emphasize teamwork and communication skills
    to facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration. Another key question is the relationship
    between sociohydrology and water resource managers. As sociohydrology is an emerging
    science, it will engage more directly with water managers—as stakeholders, along
    with the general public—as it develops. Indeed, these interactions will be necessary
    in order to incorporate insights from managers and “ground truth” sociohydrological
    models. Tackling sociohydrological challenges will require knowledge of water
    resources science as well as the social sciences, with the precise skill sets
    varying by the scientific questions pursued. A key question for mentors and advisers
    is to what degree individual researchers should be trained in this skill set versus
    preparing researchers to collaborate across disciplines. However, a core body
    of knowledge will remain essential so that scholars can interface and communicate
    with one other easily. Programs of study will grapple with what this fundamental
    body of knowledge is and should be. We suggest that several strategic skills to
    develop include methods in data science, complex systems science, coupled human
    and natural systems modeling, and causal inference. Going forward, science communication
    training will be an increasingly important skill set to develop, since this will
    enable work across disciplines, with policymakers, water managers, and the broader
    public. References Citing Literature Volume55, Issue2 February 2019 Pages 874-887

    Communications and Sensing for 6G and Beyond: A Comprehensive Review Wei Jiang
    and 14 more April 04, 2024 Next-generation cellular technologies, commonly referred
    to as the sixth generation (6G), are envisioned to support a higher system capacity,
    better performance, and network sensing capabilities. The terahertz (THz) band
    is one potential enabler to this end due to the large unused frequency bands and
    the high spatial resolution enabled by the short signal wavelength and large bandwidth.
    Different from earlier surveys, this paper presents a comprehensive treatment
    and technology survey on THz communications and sensing in terms of advantages,
    Rapid Feasibility Assessment of Energy Unit Integration in Distribution Networks
    Sicheng Gong and 2 more April 03, 2024 In contemporary heavy-load distribution
    networks, preceding feasibility assessment is imperative before incorporating
    additional energy units. However, the feasibility examination for massive combined
    operational scenarios of relevant units is computationally intensive with repetitive
    power flow calculations. To this end, this paper proposes a rapid assessment framework,
    the kernel of which is to learn from formerly examined scenarios, thus forming
    expansive feasible/infeasible regions to geometrically rule in/out subsequent
    scenarios. Without running the power flow computation in most scenarios, we accelerate
    the assessment process. Moreover, enlightened by heuristic hypersurface search,
    such prechecking efficiency can be further boosted. In a risk-averse manner, this
    framework can be conceptualized using the exact grid model. Especially, evidenced
    by testing on a 10.5kV distribution grid, the framework shows a significant assessment
    efficiency improvement and strict accuracy guarantee, where we observe at least
    76.13% assessment time reduction and zero accuracy loss in all testing cases.
    We anticipate this work to be a starting point for more sophisticated geometry-accelerating
    feasibility assessment methods. Improving Molecular De Novo Drug Design with Transformers
    Dhaval Soni and 7 more April 03, 2024 Drug design is undergoing a transformation
    as we challenge conventional methods by integrating state-of-the-art artificial
    intelligence with the intricate domain of molecular biology. At the heart of our
    endeavor lies a significant challenge: the scarcity of datasets containing active
    compounds for emerging target proteins. To confront this obstacle, we''re pioneering
    an innovative approach. We''re merging the advanced Generative Pre-trained Transformer
    (GPT) architecture with the nuanced capabilities of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
    networks, with the aim of generating Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System
    (SMILES) strings to unveil novel therapeutic pathways. Additionally, we''re employing
    a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) pretraining strategy
    to enrich our model with comprehensive molecular data, including amino acid sequences
    and molecular SMILES datasets. Through meticulous fine-tuning on a meticulously
    curated protein-ligand complex dataset, we''re achieving precise conditional generation
    via autoregressive supervised learning. Our research introduces a groundbreaking
    method to assess molecular affinity, validated against established proteins, showcasing
    superior binding affinities compared to certain FDA-approved drugs in docking
    experiments. By pushing the boundaries of generative algorithms and establishing
    a robust framework for evaluating molecular affinity, we''re driving forward the
    field of de novo drug design, offering promising therapeutic avenues and enabling
    deeper exploration of the chemical landscape. Formalising a Gateway-based Blockchain

    A document by Guzman Llambias . Click on the document to view its contents. Magnetic
    Behavior of NO Fe-Si Sheets under Tensile and Compressive Stress Carlo Appino
    and 6 more April 03, 2024 The stress dependence of the magnetic properties of
    non-oriented Fe-Si steel sheets has been investigated by measurement and analysis
    of hysteresis loop, magnetization curve, and energy losses taken at different
    peak polarization values Jp (0.5 T – 1.5 T) between DC and f = 400 Hz. The salient
    feature of the material response to the stress lies in the monotonic deterioration
    of the soft magnetic properties, across the whole (Jp - f) domain, on passing
    from the maximum tensile stress (σ = +30 MPa) to the maximum compression (σ =
    -30 MPa). This is understood in terms of stress-induced redistribution of the
    domains between easy axes, making magnetic hardening by compression directly related
    to unfavorably directed domains and 90° domain-wallmediated magnetization transitions.
    The loss decomposition is carried out across the whole investigated frequency
    range, taking into account the skin effect at the highest frequencies. Quasi-static
    and dynamic losses follow a same trend with σ, both monotonically increasing on
    passing from the tensile to the compressive stress limits, according to the theoretically
    expected relationship existing between the hysteresis and the excess loss components.
    The latter is shown to identify the correlation regions where the magnetization
    is reversed of size comparable with the average grain size and loosely following
    the dependence of the loss figure on the applied stress. A bio-inspired hardware
    implementation of an analog spike-based hippocampus memory mo... Daniel Casanueva-Morato
    and 4 more April 03, 2024 The need for processing at the edge the increasing amount
    of data that is being produced by multitudes of sensors has led to the demand
    for mode power efficient computational systems, by exploring alternative computing
    paradigms and technologies. Neuromorphic engineering is a promising approach that
    can address this need by developing electronic systems that faithfully emulate
    the computational properties of animal brains. In particular, the hippocampus
    stands out as one of the most relevant brain region for implementing auto associative
    memories capable of learning large amounts of information quickly and recalling
    it efficiently. In this work, we present a computational spike-based memory model
    inspired by the hippocampus that takes advantage of the features of analog electronic
    circuits: energy efficiency, compactness, and real-time operation. This model
    can learn memories, recall them from a partial fragment and forget. It has been
    implemented as a Spiking Neural Networks directly on a mixed-signal neuromorphic
    chip. We describe the details of the hardware implementation and demonstrate its
    operation via a series of benchmark experiments, showing how this research prototype
    paves the way for the development of future robust and low-power mixed-signal
    neuromorphic processing systems. Exploratory Study of oneM2M-based Interoperability
    Architectures for IoT: A Smart Cit... VJS Pranavasri and 6 more April 03, 2024
    The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) has ushered in transformative possibilities
    for smart cities, with the potential to revolutionize urban living through enhanced
    connectivity and data-driven decision-making. However, the effective realization
    of IoT in smart cities hinges upon the seamless interoperability of diverse devices
    and systems. To address this critical need, the oneM2M standards initiative has
    emerged as a foundational framework for IoT interoperability. In this research
    paper, we perform an exploratory analysis of three prominent open-source oneM2M
    based interoperability systems-Mobius, OM2M, and ACME. We leverage an existing
    large-scale system provided by our Smart City Living Lab deployed at IIIT Hyderabad,
    sprawling a 66-acre campus featuring over 370 nodes across eight verticals. We
    investigate the architectural characteristics of each solution, considering their
    strengths and limitations in facilitating IoT interoperability. Through this analysis,
    our paper aims to provide valuable insights for stakeholders seeking to implement
    IoT interoperability solutions in the context of smart cities. By evaluating the
    strengths and limitations of Mobius, OM2M, and ACME, we seek to offer guidance
    for selecting the most suitable solution. Our analysis reveals that the optimal
    framework choice depends on specific quality constraints: Mobius excels in performance,
    while ACME offers advantages in ease of setup for smaller-scale implementations.
    Comparing Concepts of Service Blocking Queues in Hardware-in-the-Loop Systems
    Tobias Konheiser and 3 more April 03, 2024 ZF is developing an autonomous driving
    system, which requires extensive testing of the developed devices and software
    on hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) systems. Therefore, a robust and high-performing
    HIL system is essential. The purpose of a HIL system is to replay recorded data
    to the device-undertest. Recordings are loaded, processed and streamed to the
    deviceunder-test with real-time requirements. This streaming chain includes processing
    nodes and queues. This requires careful management of queue configurations. An
    overflow in the queue will result in packet loss, while an underflow may violate
    the real-time constraint. This study aims to develop and evaluate concepts for
    service blocking queues. These concepts block or pause the incoming service to
    a queue when necessary to avoid queue overflows and associated data loss. However,
    an out-of-the-box solution is not available and different approaches affect the
    behaviour and performance of the system. Therefore, the developed concepts are
    evaluated against each other and against the existing system based on selected
    performance parameters in specific scenarios. The scenarios cover a wide range
    of situations, reflecting standard input data with varying numbers of parallel
    streams and bottleneck scenarios forcing queue overflows or blockages. The developed
    service blocking queue concepts eliminate data loss in all scenarios, but introduce
    overhead, resulting in reduced system performance. However, the service blocking
    queue concept using a modified token-bucket approach proved to be the best solution,
    as the elimination of data loss justifies the additional overhead. This concept
    is proposed for implementation and deployment on the HIL system. Generative AI-Based
    Text Generation Methods Using Pre-Trained GPT 2 Model Rohit Pandey and 7 more
    April 03, 2024 A text generation model is a machine learning model that uses neural
    networks, especially transformers architecture to generate contextually relevant
    text based on linguistic patterns learned from extensive corpora. The models are
    trained on a huge amount of textual data so that they can model and learn complex
    concepts of any language like its grammar, vocabulary, phrases, and styles. FlowDep
    - An efficient and optical-flow-based algorithm of obstacle detection for aut...
    Chen-Fu Yeh and 7 more April 03, 2024 Obstacle detection is crucial for the safety
    and efficiency of autonomous vehicles. For mini-vehicles such as palm-sized drones,
    it is a challenge to implement traditional methods like Lidar due to high costs
    and physical constraints. Vision-based deep learning approaches, while accurate,
    are too resource-intensive for the mini-vehicles. To address this issue, we introduce
    Flowdep, a novel optical-flow-based algorithm inspired by the low-resolution but
    efficient motion-detection mechanisms in insects. Flowdep combines optic flow
    and IMU (or positioning information) to estimate the depth of every image pixel.
    We also generate a variant of Flowdep using the artificial neural network (Flowdep-ANN).
    Our tests show that Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN are 5.8 to 114.7 times faster than
    the DNN networks we tested, while the accuracies of Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN are
    on par with these networks. We further tested Flowdep and Flowdep-ANN on a small
    autonomous vehicle with Raspberry Pi4 as the computing platform, and both models
    successfully performed real-time object detection. The present work demonstrates
    the potential of using optical flow as an efficient approach to estimate depth
    and detect obstacles in resource-constrained mini-vehicles. Misinformative Data
    Visualizations in the Sports Media Domain Drew Scott April 03, 2024 Sports are
    data-driven: individual performances are measured using statistics and teams leverage
    data analytics to outperform competition. Sports media-which is created by media
    outlets, teams, and individuals-engage its consumers by creating narratives about
    the sport, teams, and players. Due to the importance of data in the sports world,
    data visualizations are a pillar in the sports media landscape. These data visualizations,
    while appearing to accurately convey data to its consumers, can be misinformative;
    media creators often have incentives to present specific narratives which don''t
    always fit the data. This work contributes to an existing misinformative data
    visualization taxonomy. In doing so, it makes it easier to understand the techniques
    and design choices used to create misinformative visualizations in all domains,
    not only in sports media. A Survey of RFID Authentication Protocols Drew Scott
    April 03, 2024 "Radio frequency identification" (RFID) systems are ubiquitous
    in today''s world. In an RFID system, it is a desirable to attain mutual authentication
    between a reader and a tag before commencing application-level communications.
    This is because tags should not share secret information with unknown parties
    and readers need to defend against tag impersonation. Authentication protocols
    designed for communication between computers, however, are not appropriate for
    RFID systems because tags are extremely resource constrained (low energy, small
    memory, etc.). Thus, there have been many attempts to design secure and practical
    authentication protocols for RFID systems over the years since RFID systems became
    prevalent. This survey summarizes and compares these protocols. The Effect of
    Multipath in Distributed Arrays with Time Reversal Hassna Ouassal and 2 more April
    03, 2024 This article examines the effect of multipath channels on the performance
    of distributed arrays that employ time reversal. A model of the signal received
    from a distributed array is formulated, and a statistical analysis of the variation
    in signal power in the presence of phase noise and multipath is given. We present
    the impact these nonidealities have on received signal power, and we analyze the
    received power for three specific cases: continuous waveform, impulse waveform,
    and modulated rectangular pulse waveform in the presence of standard channel models.
    It is shown that for larger arrays in multipath channels, the change in power
    between coherent and incoherent states converges to the line-of-sight channel.
    It is further shown that in a line-of-sight channel time-reversal completely cancels
    unknown channel delays resulting in coherent signals from all nodes in a distributed
    array, while in a multipath channel only the main diagonal round-trip paths are
    coherent. Nevertheless, this additional benefit improves signal coherence in complex
    channels and can aide in distributed array synchronization using two-way time
    transfer. Disproof of Hodge Conjecture by Graph Theory Jihyeon Yoon April 02,
    2024 Hodge conjecture is turned out to be false in extension of graph theory based
    on its algebraic attribute. Hash3D: Training-free Acceleration for 3D Generation
    Xingyi Yang and 1 more April 02, 2024 The evolution of 3D generative modeling
    has been notably propelled by the adoption of 2D diffusion models. Despite this
    progress, the cumbersome optimization process per se presents a critical hurdle
    to efficiency. In this paper, we introduce Hash3D, a universal acceleration for
    3D generation without model training. Central to Hash3D is the insight that feature-map
    redundancy is prevalent in images rendered from camera positions and diffusion
    time-steps in close proximity. By effectively hashing and reusing these feature
    maps across neighboring timesteps and camera angles, Hash3D substantially prevents
    redundant calculations, thus accelerating the diffusion model''s inference in
    3D generation tasks. We achieve this through an adaptive grid-based hashing. Surprisingly,
    this feature-sharing mechanism not only speed up the generation but also enhances
    the smoothness and view consistency of the synthesized 3D objects. Our experiments
    covering 5 textto-3D and 3 image-to-3D models, demonstrate Hash3D''s versatility
    to speed up optimization, enhancing efficiency by 1.3 ∼ 4×. Additionally, Hash3D''s
    integration with 3D Gaussian splatting largely speeds up 3D model creation, reducing
    text-to-3D processing to about 10 minutes and image-to-3D conversion to roughly
    30 seconds. The code is provided in https://github.com/Adamdad/hash3D. Area and
    Power Efficient Implementation of Configurable Ring Oscillator PUF Enas Abulibdeh
    and 4 more April 02, 2024 Physically Unclonable Function (PUF) is an emerging
    hardware security primitive that provides a promising solution for lightweight
    security. PUFs can be used to generate a secret key that depends on the random
    manufacturing process variation of the device for lightweight authentication and
    device identification. This work proposes an optimized version of the Configurable
    Ring Oscillator (CRO) PUF that aims to reduce power consumption and area overhead.
    The proposed design eliminates the duplication of ROs, reduces the switching activity,
    and introduces the inter-stage delay as an additional source of randomness. The
    proposed PUF has been implemented in 22nm FDSOI technology using the Synopsys
    tools. A comprehensive security analysis has been acquired utilizing Challenge-Response
    Pairs collected from 8 chips. Results show an average of 49.42%, 38.25%, 9.95%,
    and 45.5% for uniformity, diffuseness, reliability, and uniqueness, respectively.
    Compared with the state-of-the-art, the proposed design achieves an area and power
    reduction of 75% and 65.1%, respectively. With the proposed PUF delivering 10
    32 CRPs, it is classified as a strong PUF. Additionally, the proposed design passes
    NIST tests and achieves an average prediction accuracy of 67.1% of machine learning
    modeling. A Hero Or A Killer? Overview Of Opportunities, Challenges, And Implications
    Of Text-T... Mijat Kustudic and 1 more April 02, 2024 SORA is a text-to-video
    model that can create videos based on simple user prompts. The model promises
    to revolutionize the way content is created. When SORA is released to the general
    public, it may transform a wide array of industries but also pose significant
    challenges and risks. This research aims to provide a comprehensive understanding
    of SORA''s opportunities, challenges, and implications. It explores its potential
    applications in film-making, education, gaming, advertising, accessibility, healthcare,
    and social media content creation. Additionally, it delves into its potential
    challenges and risks, including misinformation, privacy concerns, bias, regulatory
    complexities, and dependence on technology. This research provides important recommendations
    to promote responsible deployment of the AI model. Advancements and Challenges

    Abstract: Future buildings will offer new convenience, comfort, and efficiency
    possibilities to their residents. Changes will occur to the way people live as
    technology involves people''s lives and information processing is fully integrated
    into their daily living activities and objects. The future expectation of smart
    buildings includes making the residents'' experience as easy and comfortable as
    possible. The massive streaming data generated and captured by smart building
    appliances and devices contain valuable information that needs to be mined to
    facilitate timely actions and better decision making. Machine learning and big
    data analytics will undoubtedly play a critical role to enable the delivery of
    such smart services. In this paper, we survey the area of smart building with
    a special focus on the role of techniques from machine learning and big data analytics.
    This survey also reviews the current trends and challenges faced in the development
    of smart building services. The major machine learning tasks that are relevant
    to smart buildings include: data collection and acquisition, data pre-processing,

    I. Introduction Although the term “smart building” (SB) may bring a thought of
    a fictional smart space from science-fiction movies, but the reality is that SBs
    exist today, and their number is getting increased. With recent advances in machine
    learning (ML), big data analytics, sensor technologies and the Internet of Things
    (IoT), regular buildings can be cost-effectively transformed into SBs with bare
    minimum infrastructural modifications. There are smart office, smart library,
    smart home, smart health care facilities, smart hospital and many other types
    of SBs that can provide automated services that can provide many value-added services
    (such as reduction of wasted energy) and also help to ensure the comfort, health,
    and safety of the occupants. The hyperconnectivity that will be brought about
    by the emergence of IoT will increase the promise of SB since now all the basic
    building amenities and commodities ranging from your house electronics to your
    plant vases will be interconnected. But this hyperconnectivity will at the same
    time complicate the process of managing SBs. In particular, SBs and their inhabitants
    are expected to create large volumes of streaming data. ML, sampling, compression,
    learning, and filtering technologies are becoming more significant to manage the
    stream of big data of individuals. In 1981, the term Intelligent Buildings (IBs)
    was initially coined by United Technology Building Systems (UTBS) Corporation
    in the U.S. In July 1983, IBs became a reality with the opening of the City Place
    Building in Hartford, Connecticut [1]. Today, the number of SBs is growing at
    an unprecedented rate including smart office, smart hospitality, smart educational
    facilities etc. [2]. An SB is recognized as an integrated system that takes advantage
    of a range of computational and communications infrastructure and techniques [3].
    Examples of SB services include smart thermostats that allow the temperature to
    be controlled based on the time of the day/year and the users’ preferences with
    minimal or no manual configuration. Using data analytics to “learn” the users’
    preferences before taking the appropriate actions is probably the most important
    enabling technology for IBs [4]. Lately, smart coffee machines appeared in the
    market with the capability to make coffee automatically, according to users’ preferences
    and schedules. Fridges can offer allocated programming interfaces for their control
    [5]. IBs aim to provide their users with safe, energy efficient, environment-friendly,
    and convenient services. In order to maximize comfort, minimize cost, and adapt
    to the needs of their inhabitants, SBs must rely on sophisticated tools to learn,
    predict, and make intelligent decisions. SB algorithms cover a range of technologies,
    including prediction, decision-making, robotics, smart materials, wireless sensor
    networks, multimedia, mobile computing, and cloud computing. With these technologies,
    buildings can cognitively manage many SB services such as security, privacy, energy
    efficiency, lighting, maintenance, elderly care, and multimedia entertainment.
    The massive volume of sensory data collected from sensors and appliances must
    be analyzed by algorithms, transformed into information, and minted to extract
    knowledge so that machines can have a better understanding of humans than their
    environment. Furthermore, and most importantly, such knowledge can lead to new
    products and services that can dramatically transform our lives. For example,
    readings from smart meters can be used to better predict and balancing the usage
    of power. Monitoring and processing sensory data from wearable sensors attached
    to patients can produce new remote healthcare services. The main philosophy behind
    ML is to create the analytical models automatically in order to permit the algorithms
    to learn continuously from available data. The application of ML techniques increased
    over the last two decades due to the availability of massive amounts of complex
    data and the increased usability of current ML tools. Today, ML is already widely
    applied in different applications including recommendation systems offered by
    online services (e.g., Amazon, Netflix) and automatic credit rating services used
    by banks. Alphabet’s Nest thermostat utilizes ML to “learn” the temperature preferences
    of its users and adapt to their work schedule to minimize the energy use. Other
    widely publicized examples of ML applications include Google’s self-driving car,
    sentiment analysis of Amazon and Twitter data, fraud detection, and Facebook’s
    facial-recognition technology that is used to tag the suggested person on images
    uploaded by users. A. SB Trends and Market Impact In this section, we look at
    the statistics related to SBs, to allow us to understand the current trends and
    motivations in industry marketplaces and academic researches toward SBs. According
    to the report by MarketsandMarkets [6], The SB market is estimated to grow from
    7.42 billion dollars in 2017 to 31.74 billion dollars by 2022, at a Compound Annual
    Growth Rate (CAGR) of 33.7% from 2017 to 2022. In yet another report Zion Market
    Research [7], 2016 and it is expected to reach 61,900 million dollars by 2024.
    It is expected to exhibit a CAGR of more than 34% between 2017 and 2024. The market
    is primarily driven by government initiatives globally for SB projects and the
    increasing market for integrated security and safety systems as well as energy
    efficient building systems. Figure 1 shows the Statista [8] forecast market size
    of the global smart home market from 2016 to 2022 (in billion U.S. dollars). FIGURE
    1. Forecast market size of the global smart home market from 2016 to 2022 [8].
    Show All According to the Gartner report [9], it is expected that the number of
    smart connected homes grows to 700 million homes by 2020, supplied by mass consumer
    adoption and an increase in the number of devices and apps available. Figure 2
    shows Gartner’s 2018 Hype Cycle expectation for deep learning, ML, connected homes,
    and smart workspace. FIGURE 2. Hype Cycle for the Connected Home, 2018 [7]. Show
    All According to report by Research and Markets [10], [11], the global IoT SB
    market will reach approximately $51.44B USD globally by 2023. The report also
    forecast that 33% of IoT SB market will be supplied by artificial intelligent
    technologies by 2023, and automation systems of SB will grow at 48.3% CAGR from
    2018–2023. Frost & Sullivan also predict that by 2025, the growth of connected
    home living will reach 3.7 billion smartphones, 700 million tablets, 520 million
    wearable health-related devices and 410 million smart appliances in the connected
    person world. B. Related Survey Papers Although many of survey papers focused
    on SBs have been published, none of them is focused on the role of data analytics
    and ML in the context of SBs. We describe the relevant survey papers next and
    will compare these survey papers to our paper in Table 2. Chan et al. in 2008
    provided an overview of smart home research [12]. It also discusses assistive
    robots, and wearable devices. The article reviews smart home projects arranged
    by country and continent. Alam et al. [13] provided details about sensors, devices,
    algorithms, and communication protocols utilized in smart homes. The paper reviews
    smart home works according to their desired services and research goals; namely,
    security, comfort, and healthcare. Lobaccaro et al. [14] presented the concept

    research topics and the recent advancements in SBs and the vision of microgrids.
    A few survey papers have reviewed works on facilitating independent living of
    the elderly people in smart homes. Ni et al. [16] conducted a survey on the features
    of sensing infrastructure and activities that can assist the independent living
    of the elderly in smart homes. A survey on ambient assisted living technologies
    for elderly people has been presented Rashidi and Mihailidis [17]. Peetoom et
    al. [18] focused on monitoring technologies to recognize life activities in-home
    such as fall detection and changes in health status. Salih et al. [19] presented
    a review of ambient intelligence assisted healthcare monitoring services and described
    the various application, communication, and wireless sensor network technologies
    that have been employed in the existing research literature. A number of papers
    have focused IoT: (a) Perera et al. [20] discussed IoT applications from the perspective
    of context-awareness and self-learning; (b) Tsai et al. [21] surveyed the applications
    of data mining technologies in IoT; and (c) Mahdavinejad et al. [22] reviewed
    some ML methods that can be applied to IoT data analytics. TABLE 1 List of Important
    Acronyms Used TABLE 2 Comparison of Relevant Survey Papers C. Contributions and
    Organization of This Paper To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey
    that covers SBs jointly from the perspectives of application, data analytics,

    of ML-based context-aware systems to provide SB services; Identification of research
    challenges and directions for SBs and how ML models can help in resolving such
    challenges; Identification of SB applications including comfort, security, energy
    efficiency, and convenience and the role of ML in such applications. Our research

    SB services. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II introduces
    the concept of SBs and its underlying architecture. Section III introduces the
    various components of the SB ecosystem and its underlying architecture. Section
    V presents context recognition and activity modeling and the role of ML in SBs.
    Section VI highlights research and development challenges and provides a future
    perspective of SB projects. Finally, Section VII presents a summary of lessons
    learned and concludes the paper. For the convenience of the readers, we have enlisted
    the important acronyms used in Table 1. SECTION II. Smart Buildings: Concept and
    Architecture In 1984, The New York Times published an article that described that
    real estate developers are creating “a new generation of buildings that almost
    think for themselves called intelligent buildings.” Such an intelligent building
    (IB) was defined as “a marriage of two technologies - old-fashioned building management
    and telecommunications.” [23]. Since then, many definitions of SBs have been suggested.
    This is due to the fact that the life-cycle of building planning, design, implementation,
    and operation involves different industry players that have different roles. In
    addition, the rapid changes in technology are affecting this definition. For instance,
    the advent of IoT and smart city concepts is impacting the definition of SB. Therefore,
    it is hard to compose a unique view of IBs with a single definition that is accepted
    worldwide. However, it is vital to have a good understanding of the main standard
    bodies and companies involved in shaping the development of SBs [1]. The Institute
    for Building Efficiency [24] focuses on the operation of buildings to provide
    efficient healthy and comfortable environment [25]. IBM [26] focuses also on the
    operation of SBs to provide integrated physical and digital infrastructures that
    provide reliable, sustainable, and cost-effective occupancy services. According
    to the European Commission’s Information Society [27], SBs means buildings that
    are supplied by information and communication technologies in the context of the
    combining Ubiquitous Computing and the IoT: In general, the buildings that are
    supplied with sensors, actuators, microchips, micro- and nano-embedded systems
    in order to enable collecting, filtering and producing more information locally,
    to be further incorporated and managed globally according to business functions.”
    In SBs, a variety of AI and multi-agent system techniques are employed including
    [28]: Reasoning and knowledge representation including ontologies and rules to
    represent devices and building services. ML for human activity recognition. Multi-agent
    systems for distributed intelligence and semantic interoperability. Intelligent
    approaches such as planning, intelligent control, adaptive interfaces, and optimization
    for efficient management of resources and services. An SB is therefore the integration
    of a wide range of systems and services into a unified environment that involve
    energy management systems, temperature monitoring systems, access security systems,
    fire and life safety, lighting control and reduction, telecommunications services,
    office automation, computer systems, area locating systems, LANs, management information
    systems, cabling and records, maintenance systems, and expert systems [29]. Figure
    3 shows examples of SB appliances including air-conditioning systems, lighting
    systems, solar energy generators, power-supply systems, temperature sensors, humidity
    sensors, power usage sensors, and surveillance cameras. For example, centralized
    control of these elements can promote the efficient use of energy through the
    intelligent control of lights and air conditioning units and the intelligent management
    of multiple green and brown energy sources. In most cases, an SB uses an Ethernet
    backbone with bridges to a Controller Area Network (CAN) [26]. FIGURE 3. Example
    of SB appliances. Show All It is easier to introduce smart services in residential
    buildings compared to commercial buildings since residential buildings have less
    technical equipment and less stringent efficiency requirements. Because the commercial
    buildings usually have more public visitors and therefore building models for
    commercial buildings are usually more challenging than building models for residential
    buildings which usually have a limited number of the occupants most of the time.
    In addition, the costs associated with the purchase and installation of smart
    devices and infrastructure at commercial buildings is more than residential buildings.
    Figure 4 shows an integrated framework in a residential building that employs
    a network of intelligent sensors. These sensors control systems such as energy
    generation, metering, HVAC, lighting, and security. A building automation system
    manages a set of smart appliances, sensors, and actuators, which collectively
    deliver services for the well-being of the inhabitants. Examples of such smart
    appliances, sensors, and actuators include washers and dryers, refrigerators,
    heaters, thermostats, lighting systems, power outlets, energy meters, smoke detectors,
    televisions, game consoles, windows/door controllers and sensors, air conditioners,
    video cameras, and sound detectors. More advanced smart devices are constantly
    being developed like smart floors and smart furniture [28], [30]. FIGURE 4. Smart
    appliances, sensors, and actuators in a smart residential building. Show All The
    IoT will enable the integration and interoperability of heterogeneous devices
    in SBs as well as the real-time processing of the data generated by sensors in
    support of optimal control and operation of the building. In this paper, We propose
    a layered architecture for SBs based on the layered architecture of IoT. Figure
    5 shows the layered architecture of SBs. FIGURE 5. Layers of the base IoT architecture
    that serves as the foundation for SBs. Show All As can be seen from the sensing
    layer (the bottom layer in Figure 5), input data is obtained from different types
    of physical sensors that monitor environmental parameters, collect data about
    residents and detect anomalies (e.g., fire and water pipe bursts). This layer
    also includes actuators that can be controlled to save energy, minimize water
    consumption, etc. The network layer (the second layer in Figure 5), includes access
    and core networks that provide transparent data transmission capability. This
    layer serves as a bridge between the sensing layer and the upper layers which
    are mainly responsible for data processing. An intermediary software layer called
    the middleware layer is needed (the third layer in Figure 5) to provide seamless
    integration of heterogeneous devices and networks covered by the sensing layer
    of the architecture. That layer serves as a bridge between the embedded software
    that runs of smart sensors and back-end software services. This layer provides
    interoperability using standardized programming interfaces and protocols [31].
    Therefore, this layer performs the process of converting the collected data from
    various data formats into a common representation. SB middleware can be based
    on open standards or proprietary, in addition, application-specific or general-purpose.
    Most often, proprietary middleware is application-specific while general-purpose
    middleware is based on open standards [28]. The context and semantic discovery
    layer (the fourth layer in Figure 5) is responsible for managing context and semantic
    discoverers including context and semantics generating, configuring, and storing.
    The processing and reasoning layer (the fifth layer in Figure 5) is responsible
    for processing the extracted information from the middleware then according to
    the application’s type it will make decisions. In this layer, there are various
    techniques of information processing applied to fuse, extract, contextualize.
    massive data into useful actionable knowledge. In this layer, two phases should
    be identified: context consumer and context producer of the middleware. In the
    context consumer phase, the data processing techniques are applied on the data
    produced by the middleware; while in context producer phase the process of decision-making
    is implemented to supply the service layer with valuable knowledge. while in the
    second stage, further context information can be provided to the middleware for
    registration in the ontology context. Specific services and applications are abstracted
    in the application layer (the top-most layer in Figure 5). This layer presents
    a framework with direct access to the underlying functionalities to serve in the
    implementation of various types of applications. Moreover, control panels should
    be installed in the building to control the automated indoor spaces and to support
    a local human-machine interface. For instance, in a multi-story building, each
    floor could have a control panel to automate the operations, such as control opening
    the windows, control of air conditioning to achieve the desired temperature, control
    close/open the blinds according to the preferred light intensity before using
    artificial lighting [32], [33]. Summary: Still there is no single standard definition
    for SBs. In this section, we reviewed many definitions for SBs by many institutes,
    counties, regions and different disciplines; each has their own definition for
    SBs. We presented the layered architectural pattern for adapting services in an
    SB environment. We wanted to provide a general design for adapting actions according
    to the different versions of context in SBs. This architecture may be used in
    different smart environments such as intelligent transport systems, security,
    health assistance, and SBs among others. We layered the architecture into six
    layers starting from the sensing layer, which includes various types of sensors
    that are installed to collect environmental information in SBs. While network
    layer providing data stream support and data flow control and ensuring that messages
    arrive reliably by using data transport protocols such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Ethernet
    etc. Data Acquisition layer to collect the data from the heterogeneous sources
    of data. Context and semantic discovery layer to generate, configure, and store
    context and semantic information. Context processing and reasoning layer to process
    the information and extract the knowledge that making the decisions according
    to the application context. And the last layer which is application layer such
    as health assistance and elderly home care, comfort and entertainment services,
    security, tele-management, smart watering, energy efficiency, etc. After discussing
    the main components of commercial and residential buildings, we have now set the
    stage for a detailed discussion on the components of SBs in the next section.
    SECTION III. Smart Building Components Advances in smart building technology have
    driven to the extensive development of SBs to generate economic and environmental
    benefits for building owners through the convergence of IT and building automation
    systems. Figure 6 shows the key components of SB systems, these include extensive
    sensors and actuators systems, networking and communication systems, software
    platform system, HVAC system, and smart control devices. FIGURE 6. Components
    of smart buildings. Show All Current systems utilize control devices and smart
    sensors that are connected to a central system. These control devices and smart
    sensors are placed throughout the environment. Each particular system has its
    own collection of networking and communication systems that enable it to communicate
    with the central system. SBs are performing connected networks that serve as a
    communication backbone for multiple systems. In many ways, HVAC equipment is the
    most complicated building system, with numerous components arranged to produce
    heating, cooling, and ventilation. The functionality of HVAC system not only makes
    the building healthy and comfortable for its inhabitants, but it also manages
    a big part of the energy consumed, as well as plays a significant role in life
    safety. SBs adopt technology to monitor and control facility systems and perform
    any required modifications. The objective of an SB is to utilize computers and
    software to control lighting, alarm systems, HVAC, and other systems through a
    single computer interface. A. Sensors and Actuators for SBs Sensors and actuators
    are mechanical components that measure and control the environmental values of
    their environment. Sensors collect information from the environment and make it
    ready for the system. For instance, IR sensors can be utilized for human presence
    detection in a room. While actuator is a device to convert an electrical control
    signal to a physical action, such that it takes decisions and then performs proper
    actions according to the environment, which enables automated and remote interaction
    with the environment.For example, a light actuator is capable of switching on/off,
    dimming one or more electric lights [34]. The rapid development of micromechanics,
    microelectronics, integrated optics, and other related technologies has facilitated
    the development of different types of smart sensors integrated into daily objects
    and infrastructure at smart building environment or worn by the users, and are
    connected by network technologies in order to collect contextual information about
    daily living activities more efficiently and faster, with lower energy consumption
    and less processing resources. Environmental sensors are utilized for detecting
    the human activity of a specific object that performed in specific locations in
    the building, while wearable sensors are utilized for controlling and observing
    mobile activities and physiological signals [35]. 1) Environmental Sensors It
    is found that data collected from environmental sensors can form important information
    to monitor human behaviors within an SB. These sensory data are then analyzed
    to identify and observe basic and instrumental daily living activities made by
    occupants such as bathing, dressing, preparing a meal, taking medication etc.
    The environmental sensing is generally based on several simple binary sensors
    in every part of the home, RFID technology, and video cameras. This variety of
    sensing may implement important insight into contexts and actual activities although
    it might come with possible costs such as complexity. Motion sensors are utilized
    for detecting the occupant’s presence and location everywhere in the house. There
    are different types of motion sensors. IR presence sensor is one of the most utilized
    kind of motion sensors in SBs to detect occupants’ presence. Pressure sensors
    can be attached to the objects such as beds, chairs, sofas, and floors in order
    to track the actions and locations of the occupants. While Contact switches are
    usually placed on the doors of fridge, rooms, or cabinets to detect the actions
    that the occupant makes with these objects [36]. Light sensors, humidity sensors,
    temperature sensors, or power sensors are other types of sensors that are deployed
    and utilized in SB to recognize the activities. Light sensors are utilized to
    measure the light intensity in a particular room in the building. Humidity sensors
    are utilized to detect the air humidity of a specific location in the building.
    Temperature sensors are utilized to measure the temperature of the specific environment.
    while the power sensors are utilized to identify the power usage of electric devices.
    2) Wearable Sensors and Biosensors These sensors are attached directly or indirectly
    to the user body. Their small size enables these sensors to be attached to clothes,
    wristwatches, glasses, belts, shoes etc. These sensors can be categorized into
    inertial sensors and vital sign sensors (or biosensors). Wearable inertial sensors
    are highly transportable and no stationary units that can give accurately detailed
    features of occupant’s action and body posture. Those sensors are composed of
    accelerometers, gyroscopes and magnetic sensors. There is a need for receivers
    and cameras in the process of data collection, therefore can be used outside laboratory
    circumstances [37]. Wearable biosensors such as blood pressure, skin temperature,
    and heart rate are significant for collecting vital signs to monitor the health.
    The most commonly utilized inertial sensors for mobile activity monitoring are
    accelerometers and gyroscopes. Accelerometers can be utilized to measure the rate
    of acceleration accompanying a sensitive axis, they are useful to monitor the
    motion’s activities such as doing exercise, standing, sitting, walking, or walking
    upstairs and downstairs. While the gyroscopes can be utilized to measure angular
    velocity and maintain orientation. Some examples of primary vital signs are Electrocardiogram
    (ECG), heart rate, blood pressure, blood glucose, oxygen saturation, and respiratory
    rate. There are various vital sign sensor utilized to measure different vital
    signals such as Electroencephalography sensors (EEG) for observing electrical
    brain activity, Electrooculography sensors (EOG) for observing eye movement in
    ocular activity, Electromyography sensors (EMG) for observing muscle activity.
    Electrocardiography sensors (ECG) for observing cardiac activity, pressure sensors
    for observing blood pressure, CO2 gas sensors for observing respiration, thermal
    sensors for observing body temperature and galvanic skin response for observing
    skin sweating [38], [39]. 3) Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC)
    HVAC system plays an essential role in SB services. HVAC system plays a remarkable
    role in efficient energy consumption in SBs, as well as it offers new operating
    options to increase the occupants’ comfort. In addition to meeting the desired
    temperature, HVAC control systems are produced in order to sustain comfort within
    an enclosed space by producing a specific level of humidity, pressure, air motion,
    and air quality in an SB [40]. CO2, humidity and temperature levels in a building
    can affect occupant’s health and comfort; consequently measuring CO2, humidity,
    and temperature in this context can improve personal wellbeing [41]. Heating and
    cooling systems consume a huge amount of energy in the buildings, so it is necessary
    to optimize it utilizing smart controllers and sensors in order to save operational
    costs. Smart HVAC systems can sense and control efficiently different air quality
    parameters inside the building by utilizing distributed sensors and VAV fans throughout
    the building to perform an optimal ventilation [42]. Most of the current HVAC
    actuation systems in smart buildings are based on the data collected about the
    occupants using sensors and cameras, which are utilized specifically for HVAC
    systems. Certainly, There is a specific cost for the design, maintenance, setup
    and hardware of the data collection network [43]. Table 3 shows a summary for
    different types of smart sensors in the SBs. TABLE 3 Various Smart Sensors Useful
    in the Context of SBs B. Smart Control Devices Smart control devices collect data
    from a variety of sensors, process this data, and activate actuators to react
    to the events detected by the sensors. A smart control device can operate independently,
    without control by a central server. But there might be a needed communication
    amongst various control devices or they can connect with each other using the
    smart gateway. WeMo [44] is a Wi-Fi enabled switch utilized to turn electronic
    devices on/off from anywhere. It can control LED motion sensors, light bulbs,
    mart wall switches and plugs, and lighting devices, all from the smartphone app
    or browser. There is no hub needed for WeMo devices, everything can be managed
    through the free cloud service provided by Belkin. You can use the specific channel
    to connect the device to e-services such as Gmail to trigger specific actions.
    WeMo devices also support context-aware feature, it turns on/off automatically
    according to the time of day, whether it is sunrise or sunset etc. The Nest thermostat
    [45], a smart device developed by Nest—which has been acquired by Google—adjusts
    to your life and seasons change automatically. Just use it for a week and it programs
    itself. It learns about the level of temperatures that the occupants prefer and
    creates a context-aware personalized schedule. The smart thermostat turns to an
    energy-efficient mode automatically when the residents leave the building. It
    could start warming up the area when it senses activity, such as an occupant’s
    returning back home from work. The Nest Thermostat is controllable via a smartphone
    and an installed app. If you are away for a while, this device has also a capability
    to sustain a particular temperature in your house. Lockitron [46] is a door lock
    that can control the door remotely over the Internet to open and close it by phone.
    Lockitron app can be installed and used by any iOS or Android smartphone. Homeowners
    can directly grant family and friends the access to open a given door by providing
    authorization over the Internet. Lockitron can also utilize Bluetooth low energy
    technology, which means that it will keep controlling even in the event of Internet
    or power outages. Lockitron can also connect to the Internet with Bridge, through
    which occupants can control the bolt anywhere in the world. The SmartThings [47]
    SB automation system comprised of a communications smart hub, that supports various
    smart appliances and devices; the smart hub supports various technologies and
    protocols such as ZigBee, Z-Wave, as well as IP-accessible devices and lets you
    control appliances using Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity. SmartThings provides
    kits that include smart plugs, in addition, the basic sensors that can be utilized
    to measure temperature, as well as to detect presence, motion, orientation, and
    vibration. SmartThings also includes an open platform that enables smart device
    vendors and third-party software to provide hardware and software that can be
    utilized alongside the platform. Philips Hue [48] is a combination of LED lighting
    with mobile technology. An accompanying mobile app that allows you to control
    lighting systems and changing color sets depending on your mood utilizing Wi-Fi
    technology. The new Philips Hue bridge supports the required authentication to
    enable Apple HomeKit technology to control and enable your Philips Hue to connect
    to other HomeKit enabled accessories and take control of your home. Blufitbottle
    [49] this bottle records the drinking habits of the users and sends them notifications
    about the time and amount of the water that they are supposed to drink to keep
    them healthy and hydrated. The app collects data about users such as their weight
    and age, plus other factors such as the current levels of temperature and humidity
    to estimate the amount of the needed water to keep them hydrated. When the user
    falls behind with hydration, an alert sounds, as well as a simple glance from
    the LEDs, will indicate when it’s time for the next drink. Canary [50] is an all-in-one
    home security system that comprises a set of sensors such as temperature, air
    quality, sound, motion vibration, in addition, an HD video camera in one unit.
    The system utilizes ML algorithms to let the users know what is happening at home
    and take action by sending notifications to your phone if something happens. Those
    ML models learn over time and send the users smarter notifications as it detects
    motion. So that, the longer you have the system, the more effective it becomes.
    Canary is able to decrease the rate of false alarms by learning the user behavior
    and the ambient noise level and the home temperature patterns. Amazon Echo [51]
    is a small cylinder enable the users to control anything in the home via the voice.
    Amazon Echo has a powerful voice recognition capability, the user does not have
    to worry about the complexities of their voice. Amazon Echo is connectable via
    Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, the users can send voice commands to control the speakers
    as well as other compatible devices such as Belkin’s WeMo and Philips Hue. It
    can also use Amazon cloud Lambda service to send commands. To send any command
    It requires to include the name of the program, for instance, “Alexa, turn on
    TV”. It also includes a network to distant servers, which slows down the response
    time. Honeywell Total Connect Remote Services [52] this device merges personal
    smart home automation with security monitoring task. It enables the occupants
    to control and monitor everything in the home from lighting and window shades
    systems to security cameras and smoke alarms. the user can utilize a smartphone
    app or desktop-mounted hardware console for controlling and monitoring. It can
    provide real-time alerts, GPS vehicle and asset tracking, video viewing, and mobile
    control. The system only supports Z-Wave devices, it needs to be installed by
    an authorized Honeywell dealer. It does not work with Wi-Fi enabled smart thermostats.
    In addition, the Honeywell provides security cameras and sensors, it also supports
    other smart devices from third parties, such as Yale locks and Lutron lighting.
    Table 4 shows a comparison among various smart control devices in the SBs. TABLE
    4 Comparison Among Various Smart Control Devices in SB C. Networking and Home
    Gateway An SB combines a communication network in order to control smart devices
    and services within the building. The communication network of a smart building
    can be based on diverse communication media such as twisted pair cable, as the
    traditional computer networks. The networking in building automation system has
    a tendency to utilize a heterogeneous network that is made up of diverse communication
    media and network standards. The building automation network is identified by
    physical technology and communication protocols. There is an internal network
    that connects devices inside the building, as well as the external networks, can
    be integrated separately. Public Internet, ISDN, and mobile phone networks are
    some examples of external networks [28], [53]. A typical SB may comprise a number
    of different components, such as sensors, actuators, communication and processing
    devices. Because of their nature, these components have limited capabilities and
    computational capacity in term of battery capacity and capability of data processing.
    To deal with this issue, most of the SB systems have been utilized as a central
    gateway to collect, process, and analyze context data from different sensors and
    actuators in the building. Several protocols such as Bluetooth, ZigBee, Wi-Fi,
    and Z-wave can be utilized for communicating the gateway. The home gateway can
    also collect and store data for a specific time period. Typically, these gateways
    can connect to the cloud services and perform data processing and reasoning tasks.
    The centralized gateway usually does not have any interface. They can be controlled
    and managed utilizing smartphones, tablets, or computers [54], [55]. In general,
    depending on the communication media used, SB network technology can be classified
    by interconnection method into three main types: Powerline, Busline, and Wireless
    [15], [56], which we describe next. 1) Powerline Communication (PLC) PLC method
    reuses the building electrical network; such that devices, appliances, and services
    are directly connected to the main power supply utilizing the already available
    electrical outlets in a building. The data is sent through the normal cable system
    to activate or deactivate the devices in the building. PLC system is historically
    the oldest technology in SB and is generally cheap but less reliable and scalable
    [3]. Originally, the application of PLC was mainly to secure the typical operation
    of the electric power supply system in case of failures or breakdowns through
    the direct exchange of information between the distribution center, and power
    plant. Therefore, this approach has become a competitive choice for SB networking,
    benefiting from availability, robustness, and ready connectivity of this method.
    Some of the protocols of this method offer a single-way communication, which enables
    the device to only receive information but not to communicate. There are different
    mainstream protocols of PLC method such as X-10, INSTEON, HomePlug, BACnet, and
    Lonworks. 2) Busline Busline systems in SBs networks use a separate physical media,
    usually twisted-pair cabling similar to the physical cables utilized for network
    services for transporting electrical signals. This type of systems is pleasant
    the building’s occupants, albeit the configuration process is complex, and it
    requires some knowledge of networking. Although the configuring complexity and
    installation cost of this system, the use of a separate cable could present a
    positive note about this approach, as it allows this method of networking to provide
    higher bandwidth, and to make it the most reliable of the three approaches. In
    addition, this technology usually supports a completed two-way communication protocol
    that enables the appliances to easily communicate with each other [57]. Some of
    the protocols in Busline technology are Konnex (KNX), CAN (Controller Area Network),
    Modbus, Meter-Bus (M-Bus). 3) Wireless Interconnection Many of the new SB applications
    use wireless technologies such as infrared and radio frequency, which are more
    convenient for users due to their untethered nature and the elimination of cables.
    The devices within the smart building can communicate wirelessly as radio wave
    can penetrate through floors, cabinets, and walls [56]. Because of the complexity
    and cost of potential modifications and of the re-wiring process in a smart building,
    several different wireless technologies are rising to produce flexible networking
    patterns convenient to occupants without taking to consider the physical wiring
    and deployment of such wire in the building. Typically, there are various protocols
    for the wireless system such as Bluetooth, ZigBee, WLAN, Z-wave, RFID etc., which
    essentially work in the industrial scientific medical bands, particularly in the
    2.4GHz frequency range. These wireless technologies are usually related to some
    control network concept in an SB such as low power consumption, high cost-effectiveness,
    low speed, flexibility in networking, deployment as well as building coverage
    [3]. The gateway is the central server of an SB that is commonly used in IoT solutions.
    The services provided by the gateway essentially concern to system management
    functionalities such as monitoring, controlling, and configuring the systems and
    their devices. It also supports some processing and data storage capabilities
    required for complex applications. D. Software Platform For a building to be “smart,”
    it is important that all the appliances and systems in the building communicate
    and exchange data securely with each other as well as with smartphones, tablets,
    and servers in the cloud. Software platforms play a critical role in exchanging,
    archiving and disseminating information through different protocols. These platforms
    use push, pull, publish/subscribe, etc. The goal of the joint commercial enterprises
    is to develop an open source software platform in order to make the process of
    data exchanging easier between the devices of different manufacturers. Therefore,
    the users will not have to worry in the future about the compatibility issues
    when utilizing electric and electronic devices of different manufacturers at home.
    In addition, the new platform can also offer a variety of different building services
    such as entertainment, energy efficiency, and security technology. Hence, this
    will enable creating different apps for these areas of use [58]. ABB, Robert Bosch
    GmbH, and Cisco Systems Inc. established an open-software platform called Mozaiq
    Operations GmbH [59] to unify smart building technology and offer interoperability
    across for all devices and services in the building, to simplify the experience
    for residents. It will enable users to seamlessly and intuitively customize their
    appliances and devices, regardless of manufacturers and brands of these devices,
    in order to improve energy efficiency and achieve a unique level of control and
    comfort. For instance, the user can close the blinds in the home either by a click
    from a smartphone or through a pre-set instruction; and switch off automatically
    all screen devices for the children to go outside to play. In a smart building,
    many devices and appliances can simply and securely share information with one
    another and with smartphones and other smart devices; and the Internet in general.
    Indigo Domotics [60] is to implement the do-it-yourself smart building platform.
    Indigo home automation software controllers available for the Mac OS enables residents
    to combine an array of common INSTEON, Z-Wave and X10 devices for unparalleled
    control of your building lighting, sensors, thermostats, and appliances. With
    Indigo Touch (sold through iTunes app store, iOS only), users will easily achieve
    remote control of their appliances utilizing an iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch. They
    also can use a web browser on any device to control their appliances virtually
    anywhere in the world. The users can receive texts or emails about specific events
    has been detected for doors opening/closing, power failures etc. Indigo, from
    Perceptive Automation, is the newest home automation software for the Mac. OpenHAB
    [61] is an open-source software platform that follows a middleware approach for
    integrating different technologies in smart building systems into a single solution.
    OpenHAB platform address a variety of network technologies and appliances in the
    area of a smart building. Currently, the dependency on a particular vendor becomes
    a problem due to the lack of a common language that bridges the different devices
    with building automation system. The main goal of the OpenHAB platform is to integrate
    the new devices and technologies in a smart building system through a community-based
    approach. OpenHAB utilizes an OSGi based modular system for communicating between
    different technologies and devices. Bindings can be developed and deployed as
    an OSGi bundle to bridge a particular technology and device. There are different
    supported technologies exist such as EnOcean, KNX, Z-Wave, and others are supported
    through special bindings [62]. SmartThings [47] this platform composed of hardware
    devices, sensors, and software applications. Context information is collected
    from the sensors, this context is contributed to the reasoning and action that
    are performed by the application. For instance, the sprinkler in the garden can
    detect the rain, and switch itself off accordingly to save water. SmartThings
    kit comprises sensors, smart devices, and hub. While the SmartThings application
    is configured to enable users to control and monitor their building environment
    through a smartphone device. The SmartThings Hub works to connect the sensors,
    devices and building’s internet router to one another and to the cloud. It is
    compatible with different communication protocols such as Zigbee, Z-Wave, and
    IP-accessible devices. In addition, the SmartThings is compatible with other sensors
    and devices such as thermostats, moisture sensors, motion sensors, presence sensors,
    locks and garage door openers [63]. HomeOS [64] is Microsoft’s home operating
    system platform, that can be installed on a personal computer. It is an open platform
    that is not limited to Windows-based devices [65], [66]. with HomeOS platform,
    applications can be installed to maintain various context-aware functionalities,
    for example, taking an image by a door camera and sending it to the occupant when
    someone rings the doorbell. HomeOS provides a PC-like abstraction that manages
    and extends the technology of network devices to the users and developers in the
    smart building environment. Its design enables the users to map their protocol-independent
    services to support the applications with simple APIs, a kernel, and protocols
    of specific devices. HomeOS usually runs on an allocated computer such as a home
    gateway, it does not need any adjustments to commodity devices. HomeOS usually
    utilizes (i) Datalog-based access control to facilitate the process of managing
    technology in the smart home (ii) a kernel to incorporate the devices and applications
    and (iii) protocol-independent services to allow the developers manageable access
    to the devices. Lab of Things (LoT) [67], [68] is an experimental research platform
    that utilizes connected devices in the buildings. LoT offers a framework that
    provides deployment capabilities such as remote monitoring and updating of system
    health, and logging data collected from different appliances in cloud storage.
    It enables data sharing and collecting, sharing codes, connect hardware sensors
    to the software platform, and participants using HomeOS. The platform is designed
    to make it simple to design solutions that can be deployed in IoT based smart
    services such as healthcare, energy management services as it works in combination
    with HomeOS. Eclipse Smarthome [69] is a framework that has a focus on heterogeneous
    environments such as smart building and ambient assisted living. This platform
    takes to consider a variety of existing communication mechanisms. Eclipse SmartHome
    works as an abstraction and translation framework that enables communications
    across system and protocol boundaries. It provides many relevant implemented extensions,
    protocols, and standards that are significant for smart building services. Those
    implementations can be of Java library or an OSGi bundle shapes so that they can
    be utilized independently from the rest of the project. The framework can work
    on different embedded devices such as a BeagleBone Black, an Intel Edison, or
    a Raspberry Pi. Extensions of Eclipse SmartHome are compatible with the solutions
    provided by different vendors. This means your code that is written for a specific
    purpose can be extended easily on commercial platforms. Eclipse SmartHome offers
    a variety of characteristics to allow you to design a special Smart Home solution
    for your expectations [70]. Apart from discussing various SB solutions, we will
    also highlight the popular simulator called Cooja is used widely by the research
    community to produce small simulations for relatively large wireless networks
    of embedding sensors and actuators; and connected devices, in order to develop,
    debug and evaluate systems based on the wireless sensor network technology. Cooja
    simulator is a Java-based wireless sensor network simulator. It is distributed
    with Contiki OS project. Cooja enables the emulation of the set of sensor nodes,
    in addition, it can simulate physical and application layers of the system [71].
    There are three basic properties for the simulated node in Cooja: Its hardware
    peripherals, node type, and data memory. The node type can be shared among multiple
    nodes and defines properties that are common to all these nodes [72]. Summary:
    The field of SBs contains a variety of technologies, across commercial, industrial,
    institutional and domestic buildings, including building controls and energy management
    systems. Several organizations and institutions are working to supply buildings
    with technology that enables the residents to adopt a single device to control
    all electronic devices and appliances. In this section, we discussed the various
    components for SBs including sensors and actuators, smart control devices, smart
    gateway, networking and software platforms. SECTION IV. Ml Background for SBS:
    Models, Tasks, and Tools Massive data generated from sensors, wearable devices,
    and other IoT technologies provide rich information about the context of users
    and building status and can be used to design SB management. This context information
    is needed to extract useful and interesting insights for various stakeholders.
    When the data volume is very high, developing predictive models using traditional
    approaches does not provide accurate insight and we require newly developed tools
    from big data. Big data is primed to make a big impact in SBs and is already playing
    a big role in the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industries
    [73], notably for waste analytics [74] and waste minimization [75]. ML is a powerful
    tool that facilitates the process of mining a massive amount of data that have
    been collected from different sources around us and make sense of a complicated
    world. ML algorithms apply a model on new data by learning the model from a set
    of observed data examples called a training set. For example, after being trained
    on a set of sample accelerometer data marked as walking or jogging, an ML algorithm
    can classify the future data points into walking and jogging classes. ML makes
    it relatively easy to develop advanced software systems without much involvement
    from the human side. They are applicable to many real-life problems in SB environments.
    One can also design and develop self-learning and collaborative systems. ML does
    not remove the human element from data science—it draws on computers’ strengths
    in handling big data to complement our understanding of semantics and context.
    It only needs training data to extract better features or parameters required
    to improve a given system. ML algorithms can be used to make predictions based
    on data patterns. It enables the computer to learn from the fed input data without
    being explicitly programmed so that ML algorithms can learn from and make predictions
    on input data [76], [77]. Nest thermostat is an example of a device that applies
    a specific temperature in a specific room and at a certain time of day according
    to the occupants’ preference. There are devices such as Amazon’s Echo that can
    learn from voice patterns, and the others those learn from much more complex behavior
    and activity patterns. A. Ml Models ML techniques have been widely used to develop
    smart systems which can sense and react according to context modifications in
    SBs [78]. There are many different ML algorithms, according to the two well-known
    theorems No Free Lunch theorem and Ugly Duckling theorem. No Free Lunch theorem
    states “there are no algorithms that can be said to be better than any other”,
    without prior information about the problem, any two algorithms may perform equally
    well in solving a problem. While Ugly Duckling theorem states “we cannot say that
    any two different patterns would be more similar to each other than any other
    pairs.” [79]. Mainly, ML is categorized into four categories handling different
    types of learning tasks as follows: Supervised learning, unsupervised learning,
    semi-supervised learning and reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms Figure 7 shows
    ML styles. These categories are described next and a summarized comparison between
    these ML techniques is presented in Table 5. TABLE 5 Comparison of ML Techniques
    FIGURE 7. ML styles. Show All 1) Supervised Learning refers to developing algorithms
    based on a labeled training dataset, from which the learner should generalize
    a representation by building the system model that represents the relations between
    the input, output and system parameters. ML model is developed through a training
    process that continues on the input training data until the model reaches the
    desired level of accuracy [80], [81]. Some examples of common supervised ML algorithms
    are: naive Bayes model, decision tree, linear discriminant functions such as support
    vector machines (SVMs), artificial neural networks (ANNs), hidden Markov models
    (HMMs), instance-based learning (such as k-nearest-neighbor learning), ensembles
    (bagging, boosting, random forest), logistic regression, genetic algorithms, and
    logistic regression [82], [83]. Supervised learning approaches are extensively
    used to solve different problems in smart buildings. Application in SBs: Boger
    et al. [76] proposed a supervised learning system using Markov decision processes
    to help people with dementia the process of hand washing. Altun et al. [84] make
    a comparative study on the supervised human activity classification approaches
    using body-worn miniature inertial and magnetic sensors. Mozer [85] developed
    the occupant comfort control of the home environment system using neural networks
    and reinforcement learning to control air heating, lighting, ventilation, and
    water heating in the smart home environment. Bourobou et al. [86] presented a
    hybrid approach using ANN and K-pattern clustering to identify and predict user
    activities in the smart environments. Hsu et al. [87] proposed a TV recommendation
    system using a neural network model based on user personalized properties such
    as activities, interests, moods, experiences, and demographic information data.
    Fleury et al. [88] proposed a healthcare-focused smart home system using the SVM
    algorithm to classify daily living activities based on the data from the different
    sensors. Supervised learning problems can be further grouped into classification,
    regression, time series, and ensemble method problems. a: Classification The task
    of classification algorithms is to classify an instance into a specific discrete
    set of possible categories. Given two sets of data (labeled and unlabeled datasets),
    the labeled dataset is used for the training process, while the unlabeled dataset
    will be used to evaluate of the classification results. The normal process is
    to count the number of instances that are assigned to the right category, which
    is also known as the accuracy rate (AR) defined by [21]. The classification algorithm
    can mathematically be described as follows: AR= N c N t (1) View Source where
    N c denotes the number of test instances that are correctly assigned to their
    categories to which they belong; N t the number of test instances. The precision
    ( P ) and recall ( R ) are used to measure the details of the classification results.
    The four possible outcomes are true positive ( TP ), false negative ( FN ), false
    positive ( FP ), and true negative ( TN ), the precision ( P ) and recall ( R
    ) are generally defined as: P= TP TP+FP (2) View Source Given P and R , a simple
    method to describe the precision and recall of the overall classification results,
    called F-score or F-measure, is defined as: F= 2PR P+R (3) View Source Commonly
    used classification techniques include decision trees, SVM, rule-based induction,
    neural networks, deep learning, memory-based reasoning, and Bayesian networks
    [89]. b: Decision Tree Algorithms The decision tree method is an important predictive
    ML modeling approach, which constructs a model of decisions presented based on
    the actual values of features in the data. Decision trees can be utilized for
    both classification and regression problems. In tree structures, leaves represent
    class labels and branches represent conjunctions of attributes that drive to those
    labels [90]. The decision trees that the target variable takes continuous values
    called regression trees. Decision trees are often one of the favorites of ML algorithms
    because of its speed and accuracy. The most common algorithms for decision tree
    are [91]: classification and regression tree, ID3, C4.5 and C5.0, Chi-squared,
    M5, and conditional decision trees. Application in SBs: Delgado et al. [92] propose
    an ML technique based on decision trees to extract the most frequent activities
    of human behavior and the temporal relationship of those activities in order to
    produce the human behavior quickly in a smart environment. Viswanathan et al.
    [93] introduce a prototype distributed data mining system for healthcare environment
    using C4.5 classification algorithm that can provide the patient monitoring and
    health services. Decision trees algorithm is a non-parametric algorithm that is
    easy to interpret and explain. The main disadvantage of this algorithm is that
    it can easily overfit. c: Bayesian Algorithms Bayesian methods utilize Bayes’
    theorem for classification and regression problems. The most common Bayesian algorithms
    are [94]: Naive Bayes, Gaussian naive Bayes, Bayesian belief network, Bayesian
    network. Application in SBs: Parnandi et al. [95] propose an indoor localization
    approach based on Naive Bayes classification and dynamic time warping, they exploit
    the embedded sensors of smartphones to determine the building that the user entered
    and the activities that the user is performing inside the building. Verbert et
    al. [96] proposed an ML approach based on Bayesian network to diagnosis the fault
    in HVAC systems. The model has been constructed based expert knowledge concerning
    conservation laws, component interdependencies, and historical data using virtual
    sensors. Naive Bayes classifier approaches have been applied with potential results
    for human activity recognition in [97], [98]. Naive Bayes approach recognizes
    human activities that identify with the highest probability to the set of sensor
    readings that were observed. d: Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised ML
    algorithm which can be applied for both classification and regression problems
    though mostly used in classification challenges [140]. SVM is one of the most
    popularly utilized for many statistical learning problems, such as face and object
    recognition, text classification, spam detections, handwriting analysis etc. [141].
    is maximizing the margin that separating between the hyperplane of two classes’
    closest points. Support vectors are the points lying on the boundaries, and the
    optimal separating hyperplane is the middle of the margin [142]. Application in
    SBs: Fu et al. [105] proposed an SVM method to predict the system level electricity
    loads of public buildings that have electricity sub-metering systems. A real-time
    human tracker system proposed Nguyen et al. [106] using SVM for predicting and
    recognizing human motion based on the input images from a network of four cameras
    in the ubiquitous smart homes. Petersen et al. [107] developed an SVM model to
    predict the times where visitors are present in the home using only the data provided
    by wireless motion sensors in each room. Fleury et al. [88] presented a study
    for automatic recognition of daily living activities in a smart home based on
    SVM. They collected the data from various sensors such as Infra-Red Presence Sensors,
    door contacts, temperature and hygrometry sensor, and microphones. Das et al.
    [108] proposed a one-class classification approach for a real-time activity error
    detection in smart homes using one-class SVM. Zhao et al. [143] proposed an ML
    approach based on SVM and RNN to detect the occupancy behavior of a building through
    the temperature and heating source information for the energy efficiency consumption
    purposes. e: Artificial Neural Network Algorithms (ANNs) ANN models are inspired
    by the process of biological neural networks. ANN models are commonly utilized
    for regression and classification problems. The common ANN algorithms are [94]:
    Perceptron, Back-Propagation, Hopfield Network, and Radial Basis Function Network
    (RBFN). ANNs provide a number of advantages including it requires less statistical
    training, it has the capacity to detect complex nonlinear relationships between
    the predictor and response variables, as well as the ability to detect all possible
    relationships between predictor variables [104]. On the other hand, disadvantages
    include its “black box” nature, heavy computational burden and proneness to overfitting.
    However, due to the inherent features of neural networks, it has the following
    main limitations: challenge in training with no local optima, its accommodation
    to modifications in the behavior, the validation process of the results, and the
    complexity of network performance interpretation. Application in SBs: Badlani
    and Bhanot [99] developed a smart home system for energy efficiency applying pattern
    recognition based on ANNs, the system incorporates an RNN to capture human behavior
    patterns and an ANN for security applications in smart homes. Other researchers
    have applied ANNs to present context-aware services. Campo et al. [100] developed
    a system that calculates the probability of occupation for each section of the
    building and compares the probability with the current situation systematically.
    See [101] for a survey paper focusing on the role of ANNs for smart home services.
    Ermes et al. [102] proposed a hybrid classifier approach using a tree structure
    comprising a priori knowledge and ANN to recognize the activities such as rowing,
    biking, playing football, walking, running, sitting, or hiking. Ciabattoni et
    al. [103] proposed a home energy management system design using the neural network
    algorithm to predict the power production of the photovoltaic plant and the home
    consumptions during the given time. f: Deep Learning Algorithms: Deep learning
    methods represent an evolved form of ANNs in which a deep architecture (many layers
    comprising multiple linear and non-linear transformations [144]) is used. One
    of the promises of DL is replacing the manually selected features with efficient
    unsupervised or semi-supervised feature learning and hierarchical feature extraction
    algorithms. The most common DL algorithms are [145]: Convolutional Neural Network
    (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Deep Boltzmann Machine (DBM), Deep Belief
    Network (DBN), and Stacked Auto-Encoders. Deep learning has been used successfully
    in varieties of big data analytics applications, particularly natural language
    processing (NLP) applications, medical diagnosis, stock market trading, network
    security, and image identification. Deep learning is now ubiquitously used in
    major businesses and companies. Microsoft research on a deep learning system presented
    real-time speech translation system between Mandarin Chinese and English languages
    [146]. Apple’s Siri uses a deep learning trained model, and the voice recognition
    in the Google Android phone also uses a deep learning trained model [147]. DL
    utilizes a number of techniques such as drop-out and convolutions that enables
    the models to learn efficiently from high-dimensional data. However, DL requires
    much more data to train compared to other algorithms because of the magnitudes
    of parameters for estimation required by the models. Application in SBs: Choi
    et al. [114] propose two prediction algorithms deep belief network and restricted
    Boltzmann machines based on the DL framework for predicting different human activities
    in a building. They also presented a hybrid model which combines for predicting
    human behavior. The paper [115] proposes a generic deep learning framework based
    on convolutional and RNNs for human activity recognition that is suitable for
    multimodal wearable sensors, such as accelerometers, gyroscopes or magnetic field
    sensors. Alsheikh et al. [116] proposed a hybrid approach of DL and hidden Markov
    model for human activity recognition using triaxial accelerometers. Baccouche
    et al. [117] propose a two-steps neural-based deep model to classify human activities,
    the first step of the model is automatically learned spatiotemporal features based
    on Convolutional Neural Networks. Then the second step of the model uses an RNN
    to classify the entire sequence of the learned features for each time-step. In
    [118], they propose an acceleration-based human activity recognition method using
    Convolution Neural Network. In [119] a deep convolutional neural network as the
    automatic feature extractor and classifier for recognizing human activities is
    proposed using the accelerometer and gyroscope on a smartphone. Hammerla et al.
    [148] explore the performance of deep, convolutional, and recurrent approaches
    of deep learning for human activity recognition using wearable sensors. For the
    sake of measuring the performance, the authors used three representative datasets
    that comprise motion data collected from wearable sensors. g: Hidden Markov Models
    (Hmm) An HMM is a doubly stochastic process with a hidden underlying stochastic
    process that can be observed through the sequence of observed symbols emitted
    by another stochastic process. Application in SBs: Wu et al. [113] proposed an
    improved HMM to predict user behaviors in order to provide services for people
    with disabilities. They developed a temporal state transition matrix to be utilized
    instead of the fixed state transition matrix. Lv and Nevatia [112] used hidden
    Markov models for both automatic recognition and segmentation of 3-D human activities
    to allow real-time evaluation and feedback for physical rehabilitation. Cheng
    et al. [110] proposed an inference engine based on the HMM that provides a comprehensive
    activity of daily living recognition capability. They integrated both Viterbi
    and Baum-Welch algorithms to enhance the accuracy and learning capability. Chahuara
    et al. [111] proposed sequence-based models for online recognition of daily living
    activities in an SB environment. They presented three of sequence-based models:
    HMM, conditional random fields, and a sequential Markov logic network. h: Time
    Series Analysis A time series is a collection of temporal instances; time series
    data set usually have the following characteristics include the high dimensionality,
    large number of instances, and updating continuously [149]. One of the important
    purposes for time series representation is to reduce the dimension, and it divides
    into three categories: model-based representation, non-data-adaptive representation,
    and data-adaptive representation [150], [151]. Application in SBs: Survadevara
    et al. [125] proposed a wellness model using seasonal autoregression integration
    moving average time series with sleeping activity scenario in a smart home environment
    to forecast the elderly sleeping tendency. Zhou et al. [126] proposed a time series
    analysis framework to explore relationships among non-stationary time series in
    the case of data sensors in SBs. Jakkula and Cook [127] propose a time series
    based framework to determine temporal rules from observed physical and instrumental
    activities of occupants in a smart home. i: Regression The aim in regression problems
    is to estimate a real-valued target function. It is related to representing the
    relationship between variables that are repeatedly processed utilizing a measure
    of error in the predictions made by the model [152]. The most common regression
    algorithms are [153]: linear regression, logistic regression, stepwise regression,
    and ordinary least squares regression. Application in SBs: Chen et al. [120] used
    the regression technique of orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm to identify
    the physical and environmental parameters that providing the energy efficiency
    in an SB. Bouchard et al. [121] presented a gesture recognition system using linear
    regression combined with the correlation coefficient to recognize the gesture
    direction and estimate the segmentation of continuing gestures of daily usage
    activities in a smart environment. j: Ensemble Methods A combination of multiple
    classifiers often referred to as a classifier ensemble, group of classification
    models that are trained separately and the predictions of those models are then
    combined in a way to produce the overall prediction [154]. The most popular ensemble
    learning based classification techniques are [155]: random forest, boosting, gradient
    boosting machines, AdaBoost, bagging, and blending. Application in SBs: Jurek
    et al. [122] proposed a cluster-based ensemble approach solution for activity
    recognition within the application domain of smart homes. With this approach,
    activities are modeled as cluster collections built on different subsets of features.
    Fatima et al. [123] proposed an ensemble classifier method for activity recognition
    in smart homes using genetic algorithm optimization to merge the prediction output
    of multiple classifiers that make up the ensemble. They used the ANN, HMM, conditional
    random field, and SVM [13] as base classifiers for activity recognition. Guan
    and Ploetz [124] proposed a deep LSTM ensemble method for activity recognition
    using wearables: more specifically, the authors developed modified training procedures
    for LSTM networks and proposed the combination of sets of diverse LSTM learners
    into classifier collectives. 2) Unsupervised Learning Unsupervised Learning refers
    to developing algorithms that use data with no labels to analyze the behavior
    or the system being investigated [156]. Thus, the algorithm does not know about
    the truth of the outcome. In other words, the unsupervised learning algorithm
    classifies the sample sets to different clusters by investigating the similarity
    between the input samples. Clustering is done using different parameters taken
    from the data which enable us to identify correlations which are not so obvious.
    The inferring structures existing within the input data is used to prepare the
    model to prepare and extract general rules of the model. A mathematical process
    might be used to systematically reduce redundancy, or organize data by similarity
    [129]. The unsupervised approach has been applied to recognize various activities
    in smart buildings when it is challenging to have labels for input data [130].
    Common unsupervised learning problems are clustering, dimensionality reduction,
    and association rule learning. There are a variety of commonly used unsupervised
    learning algorithms, some of those algorithms are based on supervised-learning
    algorithms: the Apriori algorithm and k-Means. In unsupervised learning, usually
    there is no a measure for the output; we recognize only the features and the target
    is to define the patterns and relationships among a set of input measures [80].
    The major disadvantage of unsupervised learning is the absence of direction for
    the learning algorithm, hence, there might not be any useful detected knowledge
    in the selected set of attributes for the training. Clustering is a method of
    unsupervised learning that involves detecting patterns in the data by placing
    each data element into a group of K-clusters, where each group holds data elements
    most similar to each other [157]. Unsupervised learning problems can be categorized
    into clustering and association problems, which are described next. a: Clustering
    A clustering problem explores the internal groupings in the input data, such as
    grouping customers by their purchasing habits. Clustering techniques are usually
    organized by modeling strategies such as centroid-based and hierarchical. All
    methods are concerned with handling the internal structures in the input data
    to properly organize the data into groups of maximum commonality [158]. The quality
    of the clustering result is evaluated depends on the type of application that
    utilizes a clustering algorithm. For example, the sum of squared errors is generally
    utilized for data clustering while the peak-signal-to-noise ratio is used for
    image clustering [21]. The most common clustering algorithms are [153]: k-Means,
    k-Medians, expectation maximization, and hierarchical clustering. Application
    in SBs: Fahad et al. [128] propose an activity recognition approach that combines
    the classification with the clustering, in their approach the activity instances
    are clustered using Lloyd’s clustering algorithm. Then, they apply evidence theoretic
    K-Nearest neighbors learning method that combines KNN with the Dampster Shafer
    theory of evidence. The paper [86] proposes a hybrid approach to recognize and
    predict user activities in a smart environment. They use the K-pattern clustering
    algorithm to classify so varied and complex user activities, and ANN to recognize
    and predict users’ activities inside their personal rooms. Lapalu et al. [82]
    used an unsupervised learning approach to address the issues of daily living activities’
    learning in smart home. They utilize the Flocking algorithm for clustering analysis
    of a use case in cognitive assistance service that assists the people suffering
    from some type of dementia such as Alzheimer’s disease. Aicha et al. [83] present
    an unsupervised learning approach for detecting abnormal visits of an elderly
    in a smart home environment based on a Markov modulated Poisson process model.
    The model combines multiple data streams, such as in the front-door sensor transitions
    and the general sensor transitions. The other cases of social communication services,
    Rashidi and Cook [129] applied an unsupervised learning approach to detect social
    interaction and monitor activity daily living in a smart space, their approach
    can adapt and update automatically to reflect the changes in discovered patterns
    from implicit and explicit identified feedbacks of the occupant. Rashidi et al.
    [130] introduce an unsupervised method that identifies and tracks the normal activities
    that commonly occur in an individual’s routine in a smart environment. The activity
    discovery method of the system is produced to cluster the sequences based on the
    simple k-means algorithm. Fiorini et al. [159] proposed an unsupervised ML approach
    to identify the behavioral patterns of the occupants using unannotated data collected
    from low-level sensors in an SB. Their approach involves processing and analyzing
    collected data related to the daily living activities of 17 older adults living
    in a community-based home supplied with a variety of sensors. They extract activity
    information from collected data at different times of the day. b: Association
    The association rule learning problem is utilized to identify the rules that define
    large portions of input data, such as people that buy X item also tend to buy
    Y item. Association analysis is performed on rules discovered by analyzing input
    data for frequent if/then statement and using the criteria of support and confidence
    to discover relationships between unrelated data in a relational database or another
    information repository. Here “support” indicates how frequently the items appear
    in the database while “confidence” indicates the number of times the if/then statements
    have been found to be true. Many algorithms for generating association rules have
    been proposed. Apriori algorithm is the most well-known association algorithm
    [160]. Application in SBs: Aztiria et al. [161] proposed system that learns the
    frequent patterns of human behavior using association, workflow mining, clustering,
    and classification techniques. The core part of the system is the learning layer
    which is made up of two modules: the language module, which provides a standard
    conceptualization of the patterns; and the algorithm module, which discovers the
    patterns. Kang et al. [162] proposed a service scenario generation scheme for
    interpreting association rules extracted from the states of all devices in SB
    environments. Typically, These states are collected periodically at a specific
    time interval from the devices. Nazerfard et al. [163] propose a framework to
    discover the temporal features of the activities, including the temporal sequencing
    of activities and their start time and duration using the temporal association
    rule techniques in a smart home. 3) Semi-Supervised Learning Semi-Supervised learning
    lies between supervised and unsupervised methods. Input data is a composite of
    labeled and unlabeled samples. These hybrid algorithms aim to inherit the strengths
    of the main categories while mitigating their weaknesses. The model learns the
    patterns present in the data and also make predictions. Example problems are classification
    and regression [164]. There are some common semi-supervised learning models, including
    generative models, heuristic approaches, semi-supervised SVM, graph-based methods,
    self-training, help-training, mixture models, co-training and multi-view learning
    [94]. Application in SBs: Cook [131] combined fully-supervised and semi-supervised
    learning to recognize and follow activities that support health monitoring and
    assistance context-aware services for people experiencing difficulties living
    individually at smart homes. Liu et al. [132] proposed a vision based semi-supervised
    learning approach for fall detection and recognizing other activity daily living
    in smart environments to overcome the labeling challenges of human activities
    by systematic interpreting the activities with the highest confidence. Fahmi et
    al. [133] proposed a semi-supervised fall detection approach in which a supervised
    algorithm utilizing decision trees in the training process and then profiles are
    used to implement a semi-supervised algorithm based on multiple thresholds. Radu
    et al. [134] present semi-supervised ML method using only the low power sensors
    on a smartphone to consider the problem of determining whether a user is indoors
    or outdoors. Guan et al. [135] propose a semi-supervised learning algorithm for
    activity recognition named En-Co-training to make use of the available unlabeled
    samples to enhance the performance of activity learning with a limited number
    of labeled samples. The proposed algorithm extends the co-training paradigm by
    using an ensemble method. 4) Reinforcement Learning Reinforcement learning is
    a learning approach to control a system in order to maximize performance measure
    that represents a long-term objective [165]. Reinforcement learning, an area of
    ML inspired by behaviorist psychology, is concerned with the way that software
    agents have to take actions in an environment in order to maximize the concept
    of cumulative reward. RL algorithms learn control policies, particularly when
    there is no a priori knowledge and there is a massive amount of training data.
    However, RL algorithms suffer from some drawback such as the high computational
    cost required to find the optimal solution, such that all states need to be visited
    to choose the optimal one. The well-known approaches of RL are Brute force, Monte
    Carlo methods, Temporal difference methods, and Value function [166]. Q-learning
    [167] is a model-free reinforcement learning approach based on learning the required
    utility given a state decision. Application in SBs: Mozer [136] applied Q-learning
    for lighting regulation to predict the time of turning the lights ON/OFF in a
    building. This prediction model can be utilized to schedule the lights’ activations
    in a building for efficient energy consumption proposes. Li and Jayaweera [137]
    proposed a Q-learning based approximate dynamic programming algorithm to provide
    a more efficient, flexible and adaptive method. This approach can enable customers
    to make an optimal on-line decision making in SB environment to maximize the profits
    based on both local fully observable and the estimated hidden information of the
    building. Khalili and Aghajan [138] proposed a temporal differential class of
    RL method for autonomous learning of a user’s preference of music and lighting
    service settings in presence of different states of the user in SB environment.
    The preferences are learned by the model by using the explicit or implicit feedback
    from users when they react to the provided service. Xu et al. [139] give a survey
    of developments in RL algorithms with function approximation. They evaluated and
    compared different RL algorithms using several benchmark learning, prediction,
    and learning control tasks. B. ML Tasks for SBS In this section, we will describe
    the major ML tasks that are relevant to SB. The reader is referred to Figure 8
    for a general depiction of ML tasks in SBs and the steps taken to implement ML
    in an SB environment. FIGURE 8. ML tasks in SB environment. Show All 1) Data Collection
    and Acquisition A variety of data collection approaches are used, each of which
    has different deals in terms of capabilities, energy efficiency, and connectivity.
    Sensors and similar objects in SBs produce raw data simultaneously in an automated
    way and such devices may store the data for a specific period of time or report
    it to controlled components [168]. Data can be collected at gateways; the collected
    data is then filtered and processed, fused into compact forms for efficient transmission.
    A variety of communication technologies such as Zigbee, Wi-Fi, and cellular are
    utilized to transfer data to collection points. Data collected from a global-scale
    deployment of smart things defines the basis for decision making and providing
    services. It is possible that the decisions are unreliable when the quality of
    utilized data is poor [169]. Zhao et al. [170] propose a data acquisition and
    transmission system which could be used for monitoring systems to collect energy
    consumption data (e.g., electricity, water, gas, heating, etc.) from terminal
    meters which are installed in buildings. The system stores the data periodically
    after analyzing and processing it and finally transmits the data to servers through
    the Ethernet. Rowley et al. [171] propose the data acquisition and modeling approaches
    that can support the delivery of building energy infrastructure in both new building
    and renovated real-world contexts. Such methods provide a means to achieve short,
    medium and long-term forecasting of possible scenario pathways to multi-objective
    sustainable outcomes. CLEEN MMEA [172] platform that collects, processes, and
    manages the data and initiates contextual knowledge extraction. The purpose is
    to establish an online marketplace to collect data and provide services for different
    companies. The interfaces are made public so that any company can easily join
    the network to buy or sell services. The analysis results can be given to an energy
    services company in order to allow offering the service to the owners. A typical
    example of open access data collection system is e3Portal [173] developed by VTT
    in collaboration with Finnish municipalities. e3Portal offers information and
    tools when planning savings measures and energy retrofitting in municipal buildings.
    It also involves frequently updated data regarding energy and water consumption
    in thousands of public buildings like schools, kindergartens, offices, hospitals,
    other health care facilities, etc. Decision makers, designers, operation and maintenance
    personnel, as well as buildings users, can utilize it. There are projects that
    provide publicly available SB datasets for researchers to conduct further studies;
    A list of “Home Datasets” [174] includes the datasets collected by projects from
    UC Berkeley, MIT, Washington State University, University of Amsterdam, University
    of Edinburgh, and the University of Tokyo. The WARD [175] project supported by
    NSF TRUST Center at UC Berkeley provides a benchmark dataset for human action
    recognition using a wearable motion sensor network. The dataset was collected
    from 13 repetitive actions by 13 male and 7 female participants between the ages
    of 19 and 75. An MIT project [176] collected daily live activities dataset from
    two single-person apartments within a period of two weeks. Eighty-four sensors
    to record opening-closing events were attached to different appliances and devices
    such as drawers, refrigerators, containers, etc. Banos et al. [177] introduced
    an open benchmark dataset collected from various inertial sensors attached to
    different parts of the body. They considered 33 fitness activities, recorded using
    9 inertial sensor units from 17 participants. The CASAS project [178] at Washington
    State University provides a publicly-available dataset for a three-bedroom apartment
    with one bathroom, a kitchen, and a living room. Different types of motion and
    digital sensors are installed to support temperature readings, in addition, the
    analog sensors are installed to support readings for hot water, cold water, and
    stove burner use [179]. The PlaceLab project [180] of MIT provides a dataset collected
    from a one-bedroom apartment with more than 900 sensors, including those coming
    from motion, switch and RFID sensors. That is being used to monitor activity in
    the environment in the context of a smart home [181]. A collection of smart meters
    data from five houses in the UK [182] That consists of 400 million instances.
    The active power is formed by different appliances and the whole-house power demand
    every 6 seconds. The major challenges that arise for data collection are scalability,
    privacy, security, and heterogeneity of resources [183]. Automated sensor data
    collection process collects a large amount of data that overwhelms the collection
    and analysis centers in comparison to the data collected from other sources such
    as IoT devices and social media. This leads to a huge number of small synchronous
    write operations to the database storage system, consequently, resulting in serious
    performance bottlenecks to the storage system design [184]. Because of the extensive
    use of RFID technology, privacy issues arise in data collection; for example,
    the RFID tags carried by a person may become a unique identifier for that person.
    Also, other security concerns appear, for example, the radio signals of RFID technology
    are easily jammed. Hence, that can disrupt the data collection process [185].
    The heterogeneity of data that is being collected from different resources is
    another major challenge, such that the data are usually very noisy, large-scale,
    and distributed. This makes it very difficult to use the collected data effectively
    without a clear description of existing data processing techniques [184]. 2) Data
    Preprocessing A large amount of data are generated by sensors in SBs; this data
    comes from various sources with diverse formats and structures. Usually, this
    data is not ready for analysis as it might be incomplete or redundant due to low
    battery power, poor calibration, exposure to various malicious elements and interference.
    Therefore, raw data typically needs to be preprocessed to deal with missing data,
    discard noisy and redundant data and integrate data from various sources into
    an integrated schema before being committed to storage. This preprocessing is
    called data cleaning. The quality of data can be improved substantially by applying
    some cleaning techniques to the data before it arrives its end user [168], [186].
    Data cleaning is one of the significant tasks in the data processing phase. Data
    cleaning is not a new process particular for the IoT data processing. It has already
    been applied as a process for database management systems. Presenting a data cleaning
    method would further aid the applications to focus on their core logic without
    worrying about data reliability post-processing overheads [184]. There are many
    different techniques that have been utilized to deal with the problem of cleaning
    noisy data streams such as Kalman filters [187], statistical models [186] and
    outlier detection models [184]. One of the major challenges with data cleaning
    techniques in the SBs is the heterogeneity of data collected from different sources
    particularly WSN- and RFID-enabled data streams. The utilized data cleaning techniques
    should be able to deal with several different variables of interest to satisfy
    IoT applications’ requirements, for example, setting home temperature based on
    observed outer temperature, user habits, energy management, etc. [169] Any type
    of failures such as a failed sensor, network issues, camera failure, or database
    crashes in the process of collecting data would invalidate the data. Consequently,
    this type of impediment will dramatically increase the time required to collect
    data [179]. 3) Dimensionality Reduction There are huge volumes of raw data that
    are captured from heterogeneous and ubiquitous of sensors used in SBs. Most of
    the data collected from those sensors are redundant and they need to be brought
    down to a smaller number of features by applying dimensionality reduction techniques
    without losing significant information [188]. The main idea from the dimensionality
    reduction strategy is to find a new coordinate system in which the input data
    can be represented with much fewer features without losing significant information.
    The dimensionality reduction can be made in two different ways: by extracting
    of the features that represent the significant data characteristics (this technique
    is called feature extraction), or by only selecting the most relevant features
    from the original dataset, this method is called feature selection [189], [190].
    Like clustering methods, the dimensionality reduction approach explores and exploits
    the internal structure of the data, but in this case in an unsupervised manner
    using less information. Most of these techniques can be utilized in classification
    and regression problems. Examples of some salient algorithms are [153]: Principal
    Component Analysis (PCA), Principal Component Regression (PCR), and Linear Discriminant
    Analysis (LDA). Chen et al. [191] propose a framework using the classification
    information of local geometry of data to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset
    on human activity recognition from wearable, object, and ambient sensors. a: Feature
    Extraction The main components of the original data are the features. After extracting
    the features from the raw dataset, such features contain important information
    that is used by the learning algorithms for the activities discrimination. The
    most common methods of feature extraction work in time, frequency, and discrete
    domains [192]. Among time domain method, mean and standard deviation are the key
    approaches for almost all sensor types. While the frequency domain method focuses
    on the periodic structure of the collected data. Wavelet Transformation and Fourier
    Transform are the most common approaches. And discrete domain methods such as
    Euclidean-based distances, dynamic time warping, and Levenshtein edit distance
    are key approaches implemented in several applications such to string similarity,
    classifying human activities and modeling human behavioral patterns [16], [193].
    b: Feature Selection The main role of feature selection is to discriminate the
    most related subset of features within a high dimensional vector of features,
    so that reduces the load of noise and computational expense on the learning models.
    In order to map the high dimensional vector of features into a lower dimensional
    vector, there are several common algorithms used such as Linear Discriminant Analysis
    (LDA), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Independent Component Analysis
    (ICA) [194]. Hausmann and Ziekow [195] proposed an approach for automatically
    adapting the feature selection for SBs application ML models from the time-series
    data based on wrapper methods and genetic optimization. Fahad et al. [196] propose
    an activity recognition approach for overlapping activities using K-Nearest neighbors
    approach that distinguishes the most important features from the collected information
    obtained from deployed sensors in multiple locations and objects. Fang et al.
    [197] determine that the different feature sets generate different levels of accuracy
    for recognizing human activities, and selecting inappropriate datasets increases
    the level of computational complexity and decreases the level of prediction accuracy
    in smart home environments. The wrapper and filtering are the two main statistical
    methods of feature selection problem. It is argued that although the wrapper approach
    may obtain better performances, filters are less resource intensive and faster
    [198]. In [199], different feature selection methods are utilized for the process
    of dimensionality reduction of the learning problem to recognize the human activities
    from observed sensors. The authors show that the performance of the learning models
    to recognize the human activity has a strong relationship with the utilized features.
    c: Feature Projection feature projection can be represented as a mapping from
    the original set of features to an appropriate set that optimizes the learning
    criterion, such that the feature projection approach allows the process of visualizing
    and mapping the high-dimensional feature vectors to low dimensional one, in addition,
    it enables analyzing the distribution of the reduced feature vectors [200]. Consequently,
    the feature projection approach reduces the pattern recognition’s processing time
    and enables selecting the best-performed classifier for the reduced feature vectors.
    Hence, it makes real-time implementation possible [198]. Chu et al. [201] proposed
    a linear supervised feature projection that utilizes the LDA algorithm for EMG
    pattern recognition that attempted to recognize nine kinds of hand motion. C.
    ML Tools & Platforms for SBs There are a variety of existing ML platforms and
    tools to support the learning process. With the current increasing number of those
    kinds of toolkits, the task of selecting the right tool for processing big data
    streaming from various sources can still be difficult. Typically, there is no
    single toolkit that truly fits and provides solutions for all different problems.
    Many of the available toolkits might have overlapping uses, and each has advantages
    and disadvantages. Most of those toolkits might require experiences in the domains
    of programming languages and system architecture. In addition, usually many people
    lack a full understanding of the capabilities and how to use those available platforms
    [202]. The important factors that must be considered when selecting a specific
    ML tool are scalability, speed, coverage, usability, extensibility, and programming
    languages support. With respect to the scalability factor, the size and complexity
    of the data should be considered to determine if a specific toolkit will be fit.
    The processing platform that the library is running on and the complexity of the
    algorithm affect the speed factor. Not all the projects prioritize the speed factor;
    if the models require frequent updates, the speed may be a crucial concern; but
    not otherwise. Coverage represents the number of ML algorithms implemented in
    the tool. With the massive amount of data capturing from heterogeneous sources,
    ML community faces the challenges of how the ML model can efficiently process
    and learn from the big data. In general, the available big data tools do not implement
    all varieties of different classes of ML algorithms, and typically their coverage
    ranges from a few algorithms to around two dozen. The usability factor includes
    elements such as initial setup processing; continuous maintenance; the available
    programming languages and user interface available; the amount of documentation,
    or availability of a knowledgeable user. The extensibility factor means that the
    implementations introduced in the tools can be utilized as building blocks towards
    new systems. It is necessary to evaluate tools in terms of how well they are able
    to meet this factor. There are a variety of ML libraries that are available in
    different programming languages. Depending on the task you are trying to accomplish,
    certain languages, libraries, and tools can be more effective than others. The
    following provides a detailed observation of the strengths and weaknesses of the
    top used deep learning and ML tools. The reader is also referred to Table 6 for
    a concise tabulated summary of the described deep learning and ML tools. TABLE

    2015 under an Apache 2.0 open source license. TensorFlow has tools that support
    deep learning, reinforcement learning, and other algorithms. TensorFlow implements
    data flow graphs, where “tensors” are batches of data that can be processed by
    a set of algorithms defined by a graph. The movements of the data through the
    system are called “flows”—hence, the name. TensorFlow can run on multiple CPUs
    and GPUs. It can run on Linux, Mac OS X desktop, and server systems, and Windows
    support on roadmap, as well as on Android and Apple’s iOS mobile computing platforms.
    TensorFlow is written with a Python API over a C/C++ engine that makes it run
    fast. TensorFlow utilizes a symbolic graph of vector operations method, in order
    to easily define a new network. However, TensorFlow has a weakness that is related
    to modeling flexibility. Such that each computational flow has to be constructed
    as a static graph. That makes some computations such as beam search difficult.
    4) Torch Torch [206] is an open source ML computing framework that supports a

    need to have real-time data analysis for stream data and waiting for the information
    to be archived and then analyzed is not practical for these type of applications.
    Generally, Stream processing is intended to analyze a massive amount of data and
    act on real-time streaming data utilizing continuous queries such as SQL-type
    queries to handle streaming data in real-time utilizing scalable, available and
    fault-tolerant architecture. Essential to stream processing is Streaming Analytics.
    More and more tools offer the possibility of real-time streaming data. The following

    Facebook, bank transfers etc.). Some of the specific applications of Storm include
    customer service management in real-time, operational dashboards, data monetization,
    cybersecurity analytics, and threat detection. 2) Apache Kafka Kafka [228] is
    a fast, scalable, fault-tolerant and durable open-source message broker project
    that originally developed by LinkedIn, and subsequently open sourced in early
    2011 and released by Apache Software Foundation on 23 October 2012. Kafka is written
    in Scala. It supports a variety of use case scenarios with a focus on high throughput,
    reliability, and scalability characteristics. For example, it can message sensor
    data from heating and cooling equipment in office buildings. 3) Oracle In 2013,
    Oracle started utilizing Oracle Enterprise Manager that includes Oracle Big Data
    Appliance to manage all of its big-data technologies. Oracle has also produced
    multiple low-latency technologies for Oracle Fast Data components includes Oracle
    Event Processing, Coherence, NoSQL, Business Analytics, and Real-Time Decisions.
    Oracle Event Processing provides solutions for building applications to filter,
    correlate and process events in real-time. It supports IoT services by delivering
    actionable insight on data streaming from a variety of data sources in real-time
    [229]. Oracle Stream Explorer (OSX) and Oracle R Enterprise (ORE) aim to support
    equipment monitoring applications for the systems that made of a variety of components
    through sensors, anomaly detection and failure prediction of such systems. ORE

    management platform with self-learning that determines optimized recommendations
    and actions with messaging, imagery, products, and services within business processes.
    4) Amazon Kinesis Streams Amazon Kinesis [233] is a platform for collecting and
    processing large streams of data on AWS in real-time, AWS launched Kinesis in
    November of 2013, offering powerful services for loading and analyzing streaming
    data, in addition, it provides custom streaming data applications for specialized
    needs. Sometimes Terabytes of data per hour can be generated - that need to be
    collected, stored, and processed continuously from various application services
    such as web applications, mobile devices, wearables, industrial sensors etc. Typically,
    Amazon Kinesis Streams application can use the Amazon Kinesis Client Library and
    reads data from an Amazon Kinesis stream as data records. These applications can
    run on Amazon EC2 instances. 5) Apache Spark Streaming Apache Spark [234] is an
    open-source platform for real-time data processing, it can implement using four
    different languages: Scala, the syntax in which the platform is written; Python;
    R; and Java. Spark Streaming is an extension of core Spark API. It allows building
    fault-tolerant processing of real-time data streams. Spark Streaming allows the
    processing of millions of data among the clusters, and Spark SQL which makes it
    easier to exploit the data through the SQL language. Spark Streaming divides the
    live data stream into a predefined interval of batches, then handles each batch
    of data as Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs). Then we can apply operations
    like map, reduce, join, window etc. to process these RDDs. The last results of
    these operations are then returned in batches. Spark Streaming can be utilized
    for a variety of application such as real-time monitoring and analyzing of application
    server logs. These logs messages are considered time series data. Examples of
    such type of data are sensor data, weather information, and clickstream data.
    This data can also be utilized for predicting future states based on historical
    data. Apache assures a computation speed that performs the operations quicker
    by 100 times than what is currently offered by Hadoop MapReduce in memory, and
    10 times better than in disc. Spark can be executed either in independent cluster
    mode or in the cloud on different frameworks such as Hadoop, Apache Mesos, and

    messages and pretty much any data source possible into the HDFS. The architecture
    of Flume is simple and flexible, it is also robust and fault tolerant with tunable
    reliability mechanisms for failover and recovery. log manufacturing operations
    is an example of Flume’s application. The a massive log file data can stream through
    Flume. The log file data can be stored in HDFS and analyzed by utilizing Apache
    Hive. 7) Apache Samoa SAMOA [243] is a distributed streaming ML framework that
    contains programming abstractions for distributed streaming ML algorithms. Its
    name stands for Scalable Advanced Massive Online Analysis and was originally developed
    at Yahoo! Labs in Barcelona in 2013 and has been part of the Apache incubator
    since late 2014. SAMOA is both a platform and a library. It enables the algorithm
    developer to reuse their code to run on different underlying execution engine.
    In addition, it supports plug-in modules to port SAMOA to different engines. By
    utilizing SAMOA, the ML algorithm developer does not need to worry about the complexity
    of underlying distributed stream processing engines. They can run it locally or
    utilizing one of stream processing engines, such as Storm, S4, or Samza. SAMOA
    provides the ML algorithms for a variety of tasks including classification, regression,
    clustering, along with boosting, and bagging for ensemble learning. Additionally,
    it offers a platform for the implementation of these ML algorithms, as well as
    a framework that enables the user to write their own distributed streaming algorithms.
    For example, there is CluStream for clustering, as well as Vertical Hoeffding
    Tree, which uses vertical parallelism on top of the decision tree, or Hoeffding
    tree for classification. There is also Adaptive Model Rules Regressor, which uses
    both vertical and horizontal parallelism implementations for regression [244].

    in Table 7. TABLE 7 Comparison Between Real-Time Data Analytics Tools TABLE 8
    Categorized Applications of SB SECTION V. Applications of Ml-Based Context-Aware
    Systems for SBs The potential uses of ML in an SB environment can be divided into
    four categories: detection, recognition, prediction, and optimization [79]. We
    discuss these categories separately next. In general, detection is the extraction
    of particular information from a larger stream of information. Many detection
    applications in SBs such as fire detection, leak detection, and anomaly detection
    [245]. Many different applications have been studied by researchers in activity
    recognition in SBs; examples include fitness tracking, health monitoring, fall
    detection. [246]. The goal of recognition is to classify an object or an event
    to a predefined category. It focuses on how to make computer programs perform
    intelligent and human-like tasks, such as the recognition of an object from an
    image. The goal of prediction is to determine the temporal relations’ model between
    specific events to predict what will happen in the near future. Prediction can
    be either for classification or regression problems [247]. Event prediction when
    the goal is to predict the most probable event or subsequent activity is an example
    of classification problems, while latency prediction when the output takes on
    continuous values is an example of the regression problem. The general steps of
    applying ML processes to predict an event in an SB environment is shown in Figure
    9. FIGURE 9. Steps involved in applying ML models in an SB environment. Show All
    The goal of optimization, on the other hand, is to maximize the long-term profits
    by making proper decisions in different situations. reinforcement learning can
    be utilized with these problems. Some optimization problems can be managed as
    prediction problems such that the profits for different actions are predicted
    and the action with the highest profit would be selected. Decision making is the
    most common case of the optimization problem. It takes to consider a variety of
    variables and solving deals between the profits of different locations of the
    environment [248]. Smart buildings are becoming increasingly supplied with a variety
    of sensors that measure different parameters, and data from these sensors is analyzed
    by ML algorithms and used for a range of services and applications for the activities
    of the building occupants. SBs go far beyond saving energy and contributing to
    sustainability goals. The application and services provided by the SBs can be
    both residential and commercial ranging from e-health, e-marketing, intelligent
    car parking system, intelligent transportation system, automation, and logistics
    services. Figure 10 shows the taxonomy of basic domains of SB services. Lighting
    services are associated with the well-being of occupants depending on their activities
    in SBs that have sensors to conserve energy when lights are not needed. The power
    and electrical system may have onsite renewable energy sources to provide a percentage
    of power consumption in SBs. Waste management is related to the activities and
    actions required to collect, separate, transport, together with monitoring and
    regulation of waste management system in SBs. The security is related to managing
    automated locks, biometric devices as well as video surveillance systems in SBs.
    The communications center is related to connecting sensors and actuators in the
    building as well as the operations control center. The operations control center
    supports system analytics and decision making for the operations. Visual interfaces
    provide a dashboard that shows the status of SB services and human operators to
    better manage the building resources. These interfaces also allow the occupants
    to set up their optimal parameters for comfort and productivity improvement on
    daily activities. HVAC stands for the humidity, ventilation and air conditioning
    system, intended for the convenience of occupants that have effective interaction
    with the environment. Parking services aim to minimize the area and volume required
    for parking cars. It could support car sharing, electric vehicles and a place
    for bicycles as well. Finally, the water management services aim to increase savings
    and manage water reclamation for flushing, landscaping and air-cooling systems.
    FIGURE 10. SB services taxonomy. Show All Based on our literature survey, we have
    identified that the application areas of SBs can be elderly care, comfort/entertainment,
    security/safety, energy management, and other projects. In the rest of the section,
    we will briefly describe the major domains in providing the following SB services:
    (1) care of the elderly population; (2) enhancing energy efficiency; (3) enhancing
    comfort or providing entertainment; (4) enhancing safety and security; and (5)
    miscellaneous projects. a: Elderly Population’s Home Care SB technology such as
    sensors, voice activation, GPS, Bluetooth, cellular connectivity via mobile phones,
    smartphone monitoring apps and sophisticated computers can be especially useful
    for elderly or disabled individuals who live independently. Elderly persons can
    take the advantages of such technologies (e.g., monitoring system, emergency system,
    dangerous kitchen appliance detection, fall detection), to maintain a safe and
    healthy lifestyle while living independently [56], [249]. Smart technology in
    the SBs aims to collect real-time information on human daily activity and then
    learn of their personal patterns. ML techniques have the potential for a very
    wide array of new innovations in healthcare that will be transformative for both
    providers and their patients. Whenever a deviation from the norm patterns is detected,
    SB systems send the alerts to family members and the caregivers in order for them
    to take urgent response action. By using big data analytics and ML algorithms
    it is possible to analyze large-scale data contained in electronic medical records—e.g.,
    to learn automatically how physicians treat patients including the drugs they
    prescribe [250]. Some prominent projects in this space are described next. Chernbumroong
    et al. [56] proposed an activity recognition and classification approach for detecting
    daily living activities of the elderly people applying SVM. They used wrist-worn
    multi-sensors namely accelerometer, temperature sensor and altimeter for detection
    basic five activities namely feeding, grooming, dressing, mobility, and stairs.
    And other instrumental activities such as washing dishes, ironing, sweeping and
    watching TV. Taleb et al. [251] proposed a middleware-level solution that integrates
    both the sensing and the monitoring services for assisting elders at smart homes
    environment. The appliances used in the proposed framework include RFID readers
    that cover of the whole building, sound sensors, video cameras, smart door lock,
    microphone and speakers for interaction with the system. CAALYX [252] is a European
    Commission-funded project that supports older people’s autonomy and self-confidence.
    The service is formed of three distinct subsystems including elderly monitoring
    subsystem, home monitoring subsystem and the caretaker’s monitoring subsystem.
    The system delivers a high priority message to an emergency service including
    the geographic position and clinical condition of the elder user. EasyLine+ [253]
    project funded by the European Commission to support elderly people with or without
    disabilities in carrying out a longer independent life at home. The system uses
    a neural network, assistive software, and a variety of sensors such as illumination
    sensor, temperature sensor, door sensors, and RFID giving the capacity of controlling
    the white goods. Hossain et al. [254] proposed a cloud-based cyber-physical multi-sensory
    smart home framework for elderly people that supports gesture-based appliance
    control. Suryadevara et al. [255] proposed a model for generating sensor activity
    pattern and predicting the behavior of an elderly person using household appliances.
    b: Energy Efficiency When temperatures rise or fall in various zones of your home,
    heaters, air conditioners, fans, and other devices will turn on or off (or increase
    or decrease in speed or temperature). In order to perform an efficient energy
    consumption of the supply systems, a significant step that is necessary by analyzing
    the way that current energy consuming system is using in buildings [256]. In the
    last decade, analysis of the energy efficiency in the smart spaces has received
    increasing attention. Various approaches for energy efficiency have been proposed
    utilizing predictive modeling based on profile, climate data, and building characteristics
    [32], [257]. For instance, lights throughout your home might turn on and off depending
    on the time of day. In the past, various attempts have been made to improve energy
    efficiency in the SBs through the use of smart metering and sensor networks at
    the residential level facilities. It is a fact that these types of infrastructure
    are becoming more widespread but due to their variety and size, they cannot be
    directly utilized to make conclusions that help to improve the energy efficiency.
    ML approaches will be the key to the handling of energy efficiency problem in
    SBs. Learning about the occupants’ consumption habits is capable of generating
    collaborative consumption predictions that help the occupant to consume better
    [258]. Some prominent projects in this space are described next. Reinisch et al.
    [259] developed an optimized application of AI system for SB environment. The
    system focuses on some capabilities like ubiquity, context awareness, conflict
    resolution, and self-learning features. The system operates on a knowledge base
    that stores all the information needed to fulfill the goals of energy efficiency
    and user comfort. Jahn et al. [260] proposed an energy efficiency features system
    built on top of a Hydra middleware framework [261]. The system provides both,
    stationary and mobile user interfaces for monitoring and controlling a smart environment.
    Pan et al. [262] proposed an IoT framework that uses smartphone platform and cloud-computing
    technologies to improve the energy efficiency in SBs. They built an experimental
    testbed for energy consumption data analysis. Fensel et al. [263] proposed the
    SESAME-S project (SEmantic SmArt Metering - Services for energy efficient houses).
    The project focuses on designing and evaluating the energy efficiency services
    to enable the end-consumers in making the right decisions and controlling their
    energy consumption. The system combines a variety of smart building components,
    such as smart meters, a variety of sensors, actuators, and simulators that can
    integrate virtual appliances such as the washing machine. Vastardis et al. [264]
    proposed a user-centric smart-home gateway system architecture to support home-automation,
    energy usage management, and smart-grid operations. The gateway is supported by
    ML classification algorithms component such as C4.5 and RIPPER that is able to
    extract behavioral patterns of the users and feed them back to the gateway. Irrigation
    systems monitoring and smart watering system that keep track of rain and soil
    conditions and irrigate appropriately are a very cost-effective way to reduce
    outdoor water consumption. Investment in water management software and services,
    water-efficient plumbing, and irrigation management delivers economic and sustainability
    benefits. Water conservation and management is an example of such benefits [265].
    c: Comfort/Entertainment One of the main goals of SB research is to facilitate
    user daily life activities by increasing their satisfaction and comfort level.
    SBs supports automated appliance control and assistive services to offer a better
    quality of life. They utilize context awareness techniques to optimize the occupant’s
    comfort based on predefined constraints of conditions in a building environment.
    Typical examples of comfort services include lighting, background music, automation
    of routine activities, advanced user interfaces based on voice or gestures, etc.
    [30]. Other services related to comfort services in SB environments are Indoor
    Climate Control and Intelligent Thermostat [265]. Indoor Climate Control: Measurement
    and control of temperature, lighting, CO2 fresh air. In the SB environment, HVAC
    systems play an essential role in forming indoor environmental quality. Typically,
    HVAC systems are produced not only to heat and cool the air but also to draw in
    and circulate outdoor air in large buildings [266]. Kabir et al. [267] present
    a context-aware application that provides the service according to a predefined
    preference of a user. They use the KNN classifier to infer the predefined service
    that will maximize the user’s comfort and safety while requiring minimum explicit
    interaction of the user with the environment. Ahn et al. [268] proposed a deep
    learning model that estimates periodically the atmospheric changes and predict
    the indoor air quality of the near future. d: Safety/Security As the SB technology
    progresses, the role of ML and deep learning in security and connected devices
    will increase. Deep learning will continue to help gain insights using big data
    that were previously inaccessible, particularly in image and video. Advanced technologies
    such as behavioral analysis and ML to detect, categorize, and block new threats
    will be beneficial. In a traditional home system, as soon as a fire is detected
    the Fire/smoke detectors are activated and start sending a fire alarm. However,
    SB can perform much better than the traditional system. It not only sends an alarm
    but also turns on the light only in the safest route and guides the occupants
    of the building out, as well as it will unlock the doors and windows for smoke
    ventilation, turn off all the devices and call the nearest fire service station.
    Other than this, it can take video of the areas surrounding the building, provide
    the status of window breakage alarms, and automatically lock all the doors and
    the windows when the last person of the house leaves [30]. The main services for
    security and safety in SBs are: Perimeter Access Control, Liquid Presence, Intelligent
    Fire Alarm, Intrusion Detection, and Motion Detection Systems [265]. Perimeter
    Access Control service provides control to restricted areas and detects non-authorized
    users that access the areas. Access card provides a variety of solutions that
    allow staff members, vendors or contractors to access specific areas at specific
    times you designate. The same access card can also be utilized to check employee
    attendance. In addition, there is widespread use of biometric technology including
    fingerprint, facial recognition, and iris scans [269]. Additionally, liquid presence
    detection technique has been utilized in data centers, warehouses, and sensitive
    building grounds to prevent breakdowns and corrosion in such areas [270]. Intelligent
    Fire Alarm and its corresponding safety systems are crucial parts of an intelligent
    building. It is a system with multi-function sensors (i.e., chemical gas sensors,
    integrated sensor systems, and computer vision systems) These sensors enable measuring
    smoke and carbon monoxide (CO) levels in the building. They also can give warnings,
    howling alarms, and tell with a human voice about the place and level of smoke
    and CO. In addition, they can give a message on a smartphone if the smoke or the
    CO alarm goes off [271]. Examples of intrusion detection systems including window
    and door opening detection and intrusion prevention [265]. An infrared motion
    sensor is utilized to detect the motion in a specific area in the building. This
    sensor can reliably send alerts to the alarm panel, with the system implementing
    algorithms for adaption to environmental disturbances and reducing any false alarms
    [265]. Image recognition solution can be used in security software to identify
    people, places, objects, and more. It can also be used to detect unusual patterns
    and activities. Clarifai [272] specializes in a field of ML known as “computer
    vision” that teaches computers to “see” images and video. Clarifai’s technology
    can play a key role in security surveillance and at present, the company works
    only with home security. Each image is processed on a pixel by pixel basis through
    convoluted neural networks. Bangali and Shaligram [273] proposed a home security
    system that monitors the home when the user is away from the place. The system
    is composed of two methods: one uses a web camera to detect the intruder—whenever
    there is a motion detected in front of the camera, a security alert in terms of
    sound and an email is delivered to the occupant. And the other one is based on
    GSM technology that sends SMS. A home security system that sends alert messages
    to the house owner and police station in case of illegal invasion at home is proposed
    in [274]. The system consists of different sensor nodes as the input components
    while the output components respond to the signal received from the input components.
    The sensor nodes consist of a thief alarm, presence detecting circuit, and the
    break-in camera. Zhao and Ye [275] proposed a wireless home security system that
    utilizes low cost, low power consumption, and GSM/GPRS. The system has a user
    interface and it can respond to alarm incidents. e: Miscellaneous Projects CASAS
    [178] is a project by Washington State University that provides a noninvasive
    assistive environment for dementia patients at SBs. The project focuses on three
    main areas for SBs: medical monitoring, green living, and general comfort. CASAS
    project comprises of three layers: physical layer, middleware layer, and software
    applications layer. Aware Home Research Initiative (AHRI) [276] is a project that
    has constructed by a group at the Georgia Institute of Technology for SB services
    in the fields of health and well-being, digital media and entertainment, and sustainability.
    AHRI utilizes a variety of sensors such as smart floor sensors, it also utilizes
    assistive robots for monitoring and helping the elderly. House_n [277] is a multi-disciplinary
    project leads by a group of researchers at the MIT. The main objective of the
    project is to facilitate the design of the smart home and its associated technologies,
    products, and services. The home is supplied with hundreds of various sensors
    that are installed almost in every part of the home that and being utilized to
    develop user interface applications that enable the users to control and monitor
    their environment, save resources, remain mentally and physically active, and
    stay healthy. The EasyLiving project [278] at Microsoft Research is concerned
    with the development of a prototype architecture and technologies to aggregate
    diverse devices into a coherent user experience for intelligent environments.
    The EasyLiving project was designed to provide context-aware computing services.
    The project utilizes a variety of sensors and cameras to track and recognize the
    human activities in the room by using the geometric model of a room and taking
    readings from sensors installed in the room. The Gator Tech Smart House project
    [279] is a programmable space specifically designed for the elderly and disabled
    developed by The University of Florida’s mobile and pervasive computing laboratory.
    The project’s goal is to create SB environments that can sense themselves and
    their residents. The project provides special cognitive services for the residents
    such as mobility, health, and other age-related impairments. A generic middleware
    is utilized to integrate system components in order to maintain a service definition
    for every sensor and actuator in the building. The components of the middleware
    including separate physical, sensor platform, service, knowledge, context management,
    and application layers [280]. Other well-known smart home projects include DOMUS
    [281] which is a research project, by the University of Sherbrooke in Canada,
    that supports mobile computing and cognitive assistance in smart buildings. The
    project aims to assist people suffering from Alzheimer’s type dementia, schizophrenia,
    cranial trauma, or intellectual deficiencies. Adaptive House project [136] at
    The University of Colorado has constructed a prototype system that is equipped
    with a variety of sensors that provide different environmental information including
    sound, motion, temperature, light levels. In addition, actuators that control
    the space and water heaters; lighting units, and ceiling fans. In Asia, there
    are also some other smart building projects have been developed, such as “Welfare
    Techno House” project, which is equipped with different sensors such as ECG, body
    weight, and other temperature measured indicators [282]. Ubiquitous Home project
    [283] is another smart building project in Japan, which utilizes RFID, PIR, pressure
    sensors, as well as cameras and microphones for monitoring elderly adults. Summary:
    Recently, several different context-aware and ML techniques have been utilized
    to support SB services. ML-based approaches are capable to perform better prediction
    and adaptation than others. The philosophy behind ML is to automate the learning
    process that enables algorithms to create analytical models with the support of
    available data. ML can be applied in different learning styles including supervised
    learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, as well as reinforcement
    learning when the learning is the result of the interaction between a model and
    the environment. The general uses of ML for SB services are detection, recognition,
    prediction, and optimization. In the section, we also talked about how to acquire
    the context from multiple distributed and heterogeneous sources and the techniques
    for modeling and processing such context to be used in the application services
    of SBs. We also talked about the most used tools and platforms ML and others for
    real-time data analytics by ML community to efficiently process and learn from
    big data. Without such ML tools, one would have to implement all of the techniques
    from scratch requiring expertise in the techniques and in efficient engineering
    practices. SECTION VI. Open Issues and Future Research Directions Research on
    SBs has made great strides in recent years, but a number of challenges remain.
    We present some major challenges related to SBs in this part of the work. These
    challenges will channelize the research directions for future SBs. A. Security
    and Privacy Wherever there is an interconnection of two systems or networks (wired
    or wireless), there are issues of security and privacy and the same is true in
    the case of SB. Security is an essential role in SB environments. Any SB application
    should ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data. Access control must be
    included in SB systems, for instance, the unauthorized users should not be able
    to disconnect the alarm system by connecting the pervasive system [284]. There
    is a massive amount of streaming that is collected from the various installed
    sensors and appliances, such data needs to be processed and stored. Hence, cloud
    computing services can be utilized for this purpose. However, with all of this
    data that is transmitted, the issue of losing the privacy increases. Therefore,
    different encryption techniques are needed to preserve personal privacy [285].
    There are specific challenges related to the user’s privacy including challenges
    related to the data privacy of personal information and the privacy of the individual’s
    physical location and tracking. That needs for privacy enhancement technologies
    and relevant protection laws and tools for identity management of users and objects
    [286]. The recent trend of ML research has focused on handling security and privacy
    issues in SB environments. There are different security-related services have
    utilized ML techniques, such as determining safe device behavior by detecting
    and blocking activities and potentially harmful behavior [287]. ML techniques
    have the potential to reduce security gap because of their capability to learn,
    identify and detect the users’ habits and behaviors. Consequently, it can detect
    the abnormal behaviors predicting risks and intrusions before they happen. For
    instance, ML models learn the routine of the users, such as the time they get
    home or go to sleep. These models can suggest rules based on those detected behaviors
    from all connected devices [288]. B. SBS and Context-Aware Computing In the SB
    environment, there exists a massive amount of raw data being continuously collected
    about the various human activities and behaviors. It is important to develop techniques
    that convert this raw data into valuable knowledge [289]. Context awareness and
    ML techniques are expected to provide great support to process and store big data
    and create important knowledge from all this data [290]. The process of data interpretation
    and knowledge extraction has the following challenges including addressing noisy
    real-world data and the ability to develop further inference techniques that do
    not have the limitations of traditional algorithms. Usually, It is very complex
    to formalize and model the contextual information related to human behaviors in
    a standard way due to the complex physiological, psychological and behavioral
    aspects of human beings [291]. The humans communicate through rich languages as
    well as gestures and expressions. Modern ubiquitous computer systems lack an automatic
    mechanism of inferring information as the humans do. New research is necessary
    to raise human activities and behaviors recognition to understand the complex
    dependencies between the apps and humans [292], [293]. The context-aware prompting
    systems have essential applications in SBs such as emergency notifications, medication
    prompting, heart rate monitoring, generation of agenda reminders, and weather
    alerts. However, issuing prompts for all detected errors can possibly be false
    positives, and consequently, lead to annoyance and sometimes prove to be unsafe
    for specific activities. ML methods can be used for an accurate and precise prediction
    when a person faces difficulty while doing daily life activities [294]. C. Personal
    Data Stream Management in SBS The data streaming management system is able to
    process and transfer raw data collected from a variety of sensors to information,
    it is also able to fuse this information to a feature and directly process features
    [295]. While the data processing for a single SB is simple, it is more complex
    when processing the data from multiple SBs, because there are different people
    that tend to share less common interests and have opposing interests concerning
    the processed data [296]. The simple sensors in an SB environment can detect different
    events related to temperature, motion, light, or weather. Moreover, other appliances
    like a television and a telephone can also send their status or other data as
    events. All this data from different sensors can be used by SB services to detect
    specific states and send a request to some actuators according to specific predefined
    rules, for instance, turn on the light if the television is used [297]. However,
    this approach is not generalizable in case of a group of people residing in the
    same building. Although it can work well for one certain person when personal
    preferences can be automatically learned for an individual person, therefore each
    of the residents has to define their own set of rules [298]. Because of the increasing
    number of sensors that produce data streams, the traditional analyzing and processing
    techniques of these data streams are mostly impractical now [299]. Despite the
    availability of new tools and systems for handling massive amounts of data continuously
    generating by a variety of sensors in SBs, however, the real promise of advanced
    data analytics to still lies beyond the realm of pure technology [296]. In [300]
    discuses research challenges for data streams of real-world applications. They
    analyze issues concerning privacy, timing, preprocessing, relational and event
    streams, model complexity and evaluation, availability of information, and problems
    related to legacy systems. D. Big Data Challenges in SBS Nowadays, a variety of
    sensing technology in the SBs can be utilized to collect a massive amount of heterogeneous
    data at a reasonable cost. Typically, hundreds of thousands of transactions can
    be generated by a single SB every day. The process of storing this data over the
    long-term is challenging [258]. We can imagine the challenges and opportunities
    that the companies or government will encounter in the future to manage incoming
    data from dozens of SBs. This new data could provide us with more contextual information
    that consequently leads to much better services to the occupants [301]. In the
    world of big data, despite the availability massive amount of data, however, it
    is not necessarily easy to obtain valuable information from this data utilizing
    the traditional approaches like trial and error to extract meaningful information
    from this data. Analyzing these massive amounts of data requires new technologies
    to store, organize, and process big data effectively, it needs high-performance
    processors that enable uncovering the insights in big data. It also requires flexible
    cloud computing services and virtualization techniques, as well as software such
    as Apache Hadoop and Spark [302]. It requires providing appropriate ML techniques
    which differ from the traditional approaches for effective and efficient solution
    of the above issues. For these reasons, researchers have recently started to think
    about the problems and opportunities resulting from the adoption of big data in
    SB environments [303], [304]. The information extracted from this big data has
    significant value and could greatly contribute in the future of SBs as assistive
    tools and for better services delivery. That is why it is necessary that the researchers
    start to analyze and think about the solutions for the current and future challenges
    of big data in SBs [305]. E. Interoperability Interoperability means that two
    (or more) systems work together unchanged even though they were not necessarily
    designed to work together. When equipment, devices or appliances having different
    communication and networking technologies can communicate effectively, interoperability
    is satisfied. It is a challenge to ensure that an SB that has various components
    will be intelligible. Typically, each of these components might have been produced
    by different vendors, each of which may have created under different design constraints
    and considerations [306]. Therefore it becomes essential to satisfy interoperability
    so that a number of heterogeneous communication and networking technologies could
    coexist in various parts of SBs. For example, an energy management system may
    use Wi-Fi and ZigBee for communication purposes. A lot of work can be done in
    this context [307]. F. Reliability We can expect that the reliability is one of
    the main concern of occupants and developers of SB systems. A variety of appliances
    and devices present in SB such as televisions, microwave, washing machines etc.
    are required exceedingly to be reliable. Achieving expected levels of reliability,
    especially when linked with communication technologies utilized with these devices
    that may be expected in SBs, is a great challenge. There are different reasons
    for these challenges differences in technological approaches, regulations, development
    culture, and the expectations of the market [306]. G. Integration The key to a
    successful SB implementation is integration: linking building systems such as
    lighting, power meters, water meters, pumps, heating, and chiller plants together
    using sensors and control systems, and then connecting the building automation
    system to enterprise systems. Integration allows executives to gain smart-building
    benefits, both in new construction and by gradually transforming existing buildings
    into SBs. What these SBs have in common is integration. Generally, the integration
    in SB systems brings a range of benefits from energy savings to productivity gains
    to sustainability. The SB systems can be attached to enterprise business systems
    to add another level of intelligence that enhances decision-making and improves
    building performance [2]. However, integrating multiple systems is very challenging
    as each individual system has its own assumptions, strategies to control the physical
    world, and semantics. As an example of integrating two systems in SB, assume a
    system that is responsible for energy management, and another system for health
    care are running concurrently. In this case, the integrated system should not
    turn off medical appliances to save energy while they are being used as suggested
    by the health care system [292]. As a future perspective for SBs, You will wake
    up to the sound of the alarm, at the same time the available sensors will be aware
    that you are waking up. The other sensors such as light sensors will automatically
    turn on the light in the building, while the thermostat will warm the area that
    you are about to use in the building. Your coffee will start to brew, you will
    also get a notification on your phone about the weather. The other sensors in
    the kitchen and refrigerator will remind you with a list of items that you will
    need to pick up on your way from your workplace to home to make dinner. When you
    leave your house, you can press a button from your phone to self-drive your car
    out of the garage. After that, the security system will start monitoring and controlling
    the home. Such the doors will automatically lock. Appliances will switch to an
    energy-saving mode. When the home sensors sense utilizing geofencing technology
    that you are way back home, it will get ready again for your arrival, the thermostat
    will warm things up, the garage door will open as you pull up, and your favorite
    music will start to play when you walk in [141]. Summary: Although the recent
    researches have been done in the SBs field, there is a need for a lot more efforts;
    however, we believe that SBs are possible for the mass market in the near future.
    The main challenges and future research directions of this eld can be summarized
    as follows: User context in term of behavior and intention should be studied and
    respected whenever possible; Further research is needed into context-aware prompting
    systems, personal data streaming and big data analysis of occupants in SB environment;
    Some of the other challenges like the interoperability, reliability, and integration
    still require more attention. SECTION VII. Conclusions The promise of smart buildings
    (SBs) is a world of appliances that anticipate your needs and do exactly what
    you want them to at the touch of a button. Since SBs and their inhabitants create
    voluminous amounts of streaming data, SB researchers are looking towards techniques
    from ML and big data analytics for managing, processing, and gaining insights
    from this big data. This paper reviewed the most important aspects of SBs with
    particular focus on what is being done and what are the issues that require further
    research in ML and data analytics domains. In this regards, we have presented
    a comprehensive survey of the research works that relate to the use of ML and
    big data particularly for building smart infrastructure and services. Although
    the recent advancements in technologies that make the concept of SBs feasible,
    there are still a variety of challenges that limit large-scale real-world systems
    in SBs field. Addressing these challenges soon will be a powerful driving force
    for advancements in both industrial and academic fields of SB research. ACKNOWLEDGMENT

  explanation: The AgSAT app uses satellite imagery collected from multiple sources,
    which can sometimes lead to errors. For example, the grid cell size in the CFSV2
    datasets used in the study could extend well beyond the weather station of interest.
    The grid cell would thereby combine the microclimatic conditions of an irrigated
    (representing reference conditions), and dry areas (with non-reference conditions),
    possibly weakening the validity of the ETref estimate. This same issue is found
    at airports, where paved surfaces are prevalent. In such surface type, measured
    temperature and humidity might be higher due to little to no moisture available
    to vaporize and high energy to heat the air.
  extract_1: 'The AgSAT model uses gridded data to estimate ETref, which does not
    have a small

    enough spatial resolution to best serve ETref estimation. For ETref computations,

    weather data should be collected over a reference surface as deﬁned by ASCE-EWRI

    [48]. In arid areas with irrigated agriculture, the grid cell size in the CFSV2
    datasets

    used in the study could extend well beyond the weather station of interest. The
    grid

    cell would thereby combine the microclimatic conditions of an irrigated (representing

    reference conditions), and dry areas (with non-reference conditions), possibly

    weakening the validity of the ETref estimate. Another error anticipated in the
    gridded

    weather dataset is the assimilation of data. Overestimating temperature and

    underestimating humidity might occur if irrigation and precipitation data are
    not

    used as assimilation input data, especially in arid areas where irrigation is
    prevalent.'
  extract_2: 'Additionally, the CFSV2 datasets generally represent the weather conditions
    at the

    average elevation of the grid cell. However, air temperature can change rapidly
    with

    elevation at an average lapse rate of −6.5 ◦C per 1000 m gained [51], leading
    to some

    misrepresen-tation of ETref in areas with complex terrain if the gridded weather

    temperatures are not adjusted to the weather station elevations. Nevertheless,

    AgSAT was designed to work in agricultural areas with simple topography.'

    \ in population and the reliance on water as a key input for\nagricultural production,\
    \ greater demand will be placed on freshwater supplies. The objective of\nthis\
    \ work was to present the newly developed Android smartphone application to calculate\
    \ crop\nevapotranspiration in real-time to support ﬁeld-scale irrigation management.\
    \ As part of the answer\nto water shortage, we embraced technology by developing\
    \ AgSAT, a Google Earth Engine-based\napplication that optimizes water use for\
    \ food production. AgSAT uses meteorological data to calculate\ndaily water requirements\
    \ using the ASCE-Penman–Monteith method (ETref) and vegetation indices\nfrom satellite\
    \ imagery to derive the basal crop growth coefﬁcient, Kcb. The performance of\
    \ AgSAT\nto estimate ETref was assessed using climatic data from 18 meteorological\
    \ stations distributed over\nseveral climatic zones worldwide. ETref estimation\
    \ through the app showed acceptable results with\nvalues of 1.27, 0.9, 0.79, 0.95,\
    \ and 0.5 for root mean square error (RMSE), correlation coefﬁcient (r),\nmodeling\
    \ efﬁciency (NSE), concordance index (d), and percentage bias (Pbias), respectively.\
    \ AgSAT\nguides gross irrigation requirements for crops and rationalizes water\

    \ Our work is geared towards the development of remote sensing-based technologies\

    \ resources available worldwide are exclusively used for\nirrigation purposes\
    \ [1]. Smartly managing these freshwater resources for precision irriga-\ntion\
    \ in agriculture is essential for enhancing crop yield and water productivity,\
    \ improving\nirrigation scheduling, and decreasing farming costs while sustaining\
    \ the environment [2–7].\nSmart irrigation scheduling has evolved from computer-based\
    \ tools and programs such as\nCROPWAT [8], consumptive use program (CUP) [9],\
    \ and Washington Irrigation Scheduling\nExpert (WISE) [10], to recently incorporate\
    \ the Internet of Things (IoT). The IoT emerged as\nthe means for smart water\
    \ management applications by offering easy-to-use methods and\nreal-time scheduling\
    \ regarding water availability, crop water requirements, soil and weather\nconditions,\
    \ and crop response to stress. In this context, a shift from traditional irrigation\n\
    methods to real-time smart irrigation automation using low-cost sensors, weather\
    \ data, and\nwater balance or evapotranspiration modeling approaches is now gaining\
    \ attention [11].\nMany researchers reported using internet and communication\
    \ tools (ICT) in irrigation\napplications [12,13]. ICT include cloud-based technologies\
    \ for data acquisition transmission\nand management, soil–plant–atmosphere and\
    \ irrigation performance monitoring, and\nremote control of the irrigation process\
    \ [14]. The literature shows a plethora of applications\nof ICT in irrigation\
    \ systems at the irrigation district-scale including using remote sensing,\nRemote\
    \ Sens. 2022, 14, 5090. https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14205090\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing\n\
    Remote Sens. 2022, 14, 5090\n2 of 22\ncrop modeling, linear regressions, and neural\
    \ approaches for water demand forecast,\nand remote control of irrigation processes\
    \ (see, for example, Bartlett et al. [15]; Sesma\net al. [16], Pulido-Calvo et\
    \ al. [17]). Perea et al. [18] established an ICT-based system for\nscheduling\
    \ and managing irrigation at the micro-scale level (i.e., a strawberry farm),\
    \ using\nthe principles of precision irrigation. However, many of these tools\
    \ remain within the realm\nof research institutions, and few reach out to farmers\
    \ for direct ﬁeld applications, leaving\nthem with limited on-farm technology\
    \ access and with reliance on traditional irrigation\nscheduling methods that\
    \ often reduce yield and water productivity.\nThere is also growing attention\
    \ towards the development of web and software-based\nirrigation scheduling tools\
    \ for estimating site-speciﬁc water requirements at various scales,\nwhich has\
    \ better chances of farmer’s accessibility. One of the most signiﬁcant advantages\
    \ of\nusing smartphone applications is that they represent instances of portable\
    \ and simple-to-use\ntechnology, allowing for real-time decision-making. Some\
    \ of these tools integrate real-time\nweather data with crop-speciﬁc ET or water\
    \ budgeting methods [19–21]. Some web-based\napplications have also been developed,\
    \ such as Wateright [22], and Crop Manage [23].\nMoreover, several public agencies\
    \ have developed online irrigation scheduling services,\nincluding IRRINET in\
    \ Italy [24], IrriSatSMS [25] in Australia, IRRISA in France [26], and\nISS-ITAP\
    \ in Spain [27].\nAlthough the earlier mentioned irrigation scheduling systems’\
    \ (e.g., ICs, sensors, web\nplatforms, apps, and online irrigation services) costs\
    \ are generally falling, for growers of\nmoderate- to low-proﬁt crops, this technology\
    \ may still be cost-unaffordable if it does\nnot signiﬁcantly increase farmer\
    \ income [28]. In addition, the computerized irrigation\ntechnologies have limited\
    \ on-ﬁeld applicability due to the need for desktop computers,\nwhich represents\
    \ one other signiﬁcant barrier that hampers their adoption by farmers.\nSuch web-based\
    \ tools may have limited user interaction and rely heavily on frequent user-\n\
    follow up using a laptop or desktop computer. Farmers readily adopt simple technologies\n\
    that require limited knowledge and skills, such as auto-steer machinery, irrigation\
    \ pivots,\nsprinklers, and others. However, the implementation of information-intensive\
    \ technologies\nis often limited. These innovations may require further investments\
    \ in hiring external\nservices to train farmers [29–31]. While the available literature\
    \ has tended to focus on major\nadvancements in smart irrigation applications,\
    \ many agricultural regions in the world\nlack the availability of the above technologies.\
    \ Less-skilled farmers in countries where\nagriculture is viewed as a chief economic\
    \ sector are often held back from the potential\nadoption of such technologies.\n\
    The increased use of smartphones, combined with weather data availability, has\
    \ cre-\nated an excellent environment for developing and deploying smartphone\
    \ applications for\ncalculating crop water requirements in near real-time. Several\
    \ smart irrigation mobile apps\nwere designed using this approach. In contrast\
    \ to web-based tools, smartphone applications\nprovide increased operational ﬂexibility,\
    \ simplicity in control, and continuous user–tool\ninteraction. Smart Irrigation\
    \ apps (for example, those developed by the Universities of\nFlorida and Georgia)\
    \ may offer real-time irrigation schedules for commercially valuable\nseasonal\
    \ and perennial selected crops, including strawberry, avocado, citrus, peanut,\
    \ cot-\nton, and vegetables. The irrigation schedule is based on the integration\
    \ of weather and\nshort-term forecasted data with crop evapotranspiration (ETc)\
    \ or water balance approach.\nSuch apps are customized according to the users’\
    \ practices in terms of the used irrigation\nsystems, splitting irrigation events,\
    \ water conservation options, and other management\nmethods. While the limitation\
    \ of these apps is the spatial variability of rainfall, their vali-\ndation over\
    \ multiple seasons at ﬁeld level in water savings for lawn, tomato, and citrus\n\
    are 57, 33, and 24%, respectively [18,32,33]. Blueleaf is another example of a\
    \ smartphone\napplication developed in partnership with IAM (Institut Agronomique\
    \ Méditerannéen) of\nBari (Italy), the CNR of Italy, and a consortium of Italian\
    \ enterprises [12]. Daily soil-water\nbalance is modeled based on station weather\
    \ data, and farmers need to add a range of\nrequired information into the application\
    \ and install a soil moisture probe, making the\napp laborious to use. Another\
    \ example of smartphone apps with similar capabilities is\nRemote Sens. 2022,\
    \ 14, 5090\n3 of 22\nthe Colorado State University WISE Irrigation Scheduler [15].\
    \ Recently, the EVAPO app\nwas developed that provides reference point ET data\
    \ based on the NASA-POWER system.\nHowever, the grid size of the weather data\
    \ has a spatial resolution of 1 × 1◦, or 12347 km2\n(111.12 × 111.12 km) at the\
    \ equator [34].\nEvapotranspiration is a key parameter for hydrological and climatological\
    \ studies,\nas well as for agricultural water resources management, such as irrigation\
    \ management\nand planning. Several empirical methods to estimate reference evapotranspiration\
    \ have\nbeen developed in the past 50 years, with the ASCE-Penman–Monteith method\
    \ being the\nmost accurate one under different climatic conditions [35]. The availability\
    \ of high spatial\nresolutions of satellite imagery that is publicly available\
    \ nowadays (such as the Sentinel-2\nimagery from the Copernicus mission of the\
    \ European Space Agency) and the long period\nof records of Landsat imagery provides\
    \ opportunities to develop operational and global\nevapotranspiration (ET) datasets\
    \ at ﬁeld scales [36]. Our innovation avoids scalability\nlimitations and diverts\
    \ from the availability of on-farm weather stations and soil sensors.\nWe developed\
    \ the ﬁrst global smart irrigation application (AgSAT), that relies on\nremote\
    \ sensing and gridded global weather data forecasts and, as such, has near real-\n\
    time operational capability. The application was released to the Google Play store\
    \ in\nEnglish and Arabic. The app performs on-demand satellite and climate data\
    \ processing\nthrough Google’s Earth Engine-enabling environment. It provides\
    \ crop water requirements\nbased on crop growth coefﬁcients derived from remotely\
    \ sensed vegetation indices at a\nresolution of 10m and based on reference evapotranspiration\
    \ calculated every six hours and\npopulated to the daily interval from the coupled\
    \ rorecast system model version 2 (CFSV2).\nThe objectives of this study were\
    \ to (1) provide a general overview of the AgSAT app,\n(2) evaluate the remote-sensing-based\
    \ approach for calculating ETref through comparison\nagainst meteorological data\
    \ collected from 18 weather stations at various locations in\ndifferent climatic\
    \ regions and temporal scales (daily and monthly), and (3) asses the\nremotely\
    \ sensed estimates of ETref and Kc at plot scale over an irrigated potato ﬁeld,\n\
    located in Lebanon at the Agriculture Research and Education Center (AREC) during\n\
    the growing season of 12 March–15 July 2020. Therefore, we aimed to demonstrate\
    \ the\noperational application of AgSAT to monitor irrigation water use at the\
    \ ﬁeld level and\nglobal scales.\n2. AgSAT App Conceptual Framework\n2.1. Model\
    \ Overview: Crop Water Requirement Based on FAO 56 Approach\nSeveral studies have\
    \ reported that the FAO-56 Penman–Monteith (FAO-PM) model,\nwhich has been tested\
    \ in many regions of the world, is renowned for being the most\naccurate under\
    \ different climatic conditions [35]. The model for crop water requirements\n\
    used in the AgSAT app is based on the FAO-56 approach. We provided, herein, a\
    \ brief\ndescription of the main calculations. The FAO-56 is based on the concept\
    \ of reference\nevapotranspiration for standard, well-watered crops by crop coefﬁcients\
    \ to account for the\ninﬂuences of ET during the growing season. Therefore, the\
    \ actual crop evapotranspiration\nis estimated as follows:\nET = Kcb × ETre f\n\
    (1)\nwhere ET is the actual evapotranspiration, Kcb is the basal crop coefﬁcient,\
    \ and ETref is the\nreference evapotranspiration.\nAgSAT calculates the ASCE Standardized\
    \ Penman–Monteith evapotranspiration prod-\nuct (ETref) using the 6 h CFSV2 gridded\
    \ (0.2 arc degrees) weather dataset available in\nGoogle Earth Engine data generated\
    \ by the National Centers for Environmental Predic-\ntion (NCEP) of the National\
    \ Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) [36]. The\nCFSV2 version 2 was\
    \ developed at the Environmental Modeling Center at NCEP. CFSV2 is\na fully coupled\
    \ model representing the interaction between the Earth’s atmosphere, oceans,\n\
    land, and sea ice. Currently, CFSV2 is the global weather reanalysis and forecast\
    \ with the\nhighest temporal and spatial resolution to allow for real-time reference\
    \ evapotranspiration\ncalculations and forecasts on Google Earth Engine. Other\
    \ available datasets or systems\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 5090\n4 of 22\n(e.g.,\
    \ GLDAS, NASA-POWER, ECMWF) are either unavailable in near real-time unless\n\
    paid for or have a lower resolution. Each grid of the CFSV2 ﬁle covers an approximate\
    \ area\nof 490 km2. We used the weather variables in Table 1 for deriving ETref\
    \ after adjusting the\nwind-speed to 2 m height. In the ASCE-Penman–Monteith equation,\
    \ the surface resistance\nrs is computed from the leaf area index (LAI), which\
    \ is a function of the height speciﬁed\nfor the reference type, usually either\
    \ grass or alfalfa. Algorithms for LAI depend on the\nreference type. Therefore,\
    \ the value of rs (and the aerodynamic resistance ra) will change\nwith the height\
    \ speciﬁed for the reference. Based on the ASCE LAI algorithms, the values\nfor\
    \ rs for 24-hour time steps are rs = 70 s m−1 for 0.12 m tall grass and rs = 45\
    \ s m−1 for 0.5 m\ntall alfalfa. Because the Penman–Monteith equation is well-documented\
    \ in the scientiﬁc\nliterature, we did not repeat its presentation in this paper.\n\

    \ crop coefﬁcient (Kcb) is a major variable determining crop transpiration, and\n\
    its estimation is necessary to determine crop water use. Crop coefﬁcients have\
    \ been shown\nto correlate well with satellite-based vegetation indices, making\
    \ their remote estimation\nfrom operational platforms practical [37–39]. The normalized\
    \ difference vegetation index\n(NDVI) and other vegetation indices such as the\
    \ soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) and\nthe enhanced vegetation index (EVI)\
    \ have been used as the main operational parameters to\nmonitor vegetation status\
    \ using Earth Observation. These indices rely on the difference\nin reﬂectance\
    \ of vegetation (between the near-infrared band heavily reﬂected by healthy\n\
    vegetation and the red-band absorbed for photosynthesis). In 2015, the Copernicus\
    \ ESA\nmission made available the highest resolution (10 m) remotely sensed satellite\
    \ imagery\nfrom the Sentinel-2 satellite. Sentinel-2 is now available at 5-day\
    \ revisit time, making\nits utilization in vegetation monitoring helpful. We utilized\
    \ the red (Band 4) and the\nnear-infrared band (Band 8A) of Sentinel-2 to derive\
    \ the normalized difference vegetation\nindex and the soil-adjusted vegetation\
    \ index (SAVI). Several researchers have provided\nempirical equations to derive\
    \ the crop coefﬁcients from the NDVI and SAVI [38,40–43].\nKamble, Kilic, and\
    \ Hubbard [38] developed a simple linear regression model between Kcb\ncalculated\
    \ from the ﬂux data measured for different crops and cropping practices using\n\
    AmeriFlux towers and MODIS NDVI. We adopted equations from the literature to derive\n\
    Kcb according to crop type (Table A1). We used a generic equation to calculate\
    \ the crop\ncoefﬁcient surrogate for crops that do not have a corresponding NDVI–Kcb\
    \ relationship.\nFirst, NDVI is transformed into a fractional vegetative cover\
    \ (Fc) via empirical relationships\ndeveloped by USDA and NASA [37] as follows:\n\
    Fc = 1.26 × NDVI − 0.18\n(2)\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 5090\n5 of 22\nKcb is determined\
    \ using the generic equation as established by Melton et al. [44]\nfollowing methods\
    \ described by Allen and Pereira [45]:\nKcb = −0.4766 × F2\nc + 1.4048 × Fc +\
    \ 0.15\n(3)\nFor the derived NDVI/SAVI at 10 m, we masked out pixels of cloud\
    \ shadow, adjacent\ncloud, cloud, and cirrus. We interpolated the NDVI/SAVI from\
    \ the latest available image\nfor masked pixels to a daily time step. The interpolated\
    \ NDVI/SAVI were then used to\ncalculate the crop growth coefﬁcient. Finally,\
    \ the crop coefﬁcient is multiplied by the daily\nreference evapotranspiration\

    \ requirement is the actual crop water\nrequirements calculated with an assumption\
    \ of zero rainfall). Hence, gross water irrigation\nrequirements are provided\
    \ under dry weather conditions. Once the user selects the valve\nsize irrigating\
    \ the ﬁeld, run-times (run time = total irrigation requirement/ discharge of\n\
    the water pump) are calculated from ﬂow rates assuming design water ﬂow velocity\
    \ in\nclosed pipes of 1.5 m/s (which is recommended for ﬂow in pressurized closed\
    \ conduits).\nRun-times are not calculated for surface irrigation systems and\
    \ only refer to the total dura-\ntion of irrigation needed for the ﬁeld given\
    \ the system type, the ﬁeld area, and the valve\nsize (main or submain pipe size\
    \ irrigating the ﬁeld). No leaching requirement is included\nin adjusting the\
    \ run-time values, and it is assumed that the irrigation efﬁciencies will\nhandle\
    \ necessary leaching, except for saline soils or irrigation water. AgSAT also\
    \ provides\na ﬁve-day irrigation volume requirement should the user decide to\

    3. AgSAT ETref Performance Analyses\n3.1. Direct Validation of AgSAT ETref against\

    \ AgSAT, we compared ETref estimated by the AgSAT\nwith the ETref calculated from\
    \ meteorological data collected from 18 weather stations at\nvarious locations\
    \ in different climatic regions worldwide (USA, South America, Europe,\nAfrica,\
    \ Asia) (Figure 3). The daily station ETref equation was calculated using the\
    \ REF-\nET software of the University of Idaho. The agrometeorological data used\
    \ from weather\nstations were temperature (◦C), solar radiation (W m−2), and wind\
    \ speed (m s−1). Some\nweather networks included hourly minimum and maximum temperatures.\
    \ At this step, the\ndaily min/max values were taken as the minimum of the hourly\
    \ minimum temperatures\nand a maximum of the hourly maximum temperatures. Clear\
    \ sky solar radiation was used\nwhen solar radiation data was missing. Solar radiation\
    \ was calculated as recommended in\nAllen, Walter, Elliott, Howell, Itenﬁsu, Jensen,\
    \ and Snyder [36]. Both AgSAT and station\nETref evaluations were performed on\
    \ a daily time step since a day is a typical time period\nover which ETref is\
    \ calculated and is generally the shortest period in which irrigation\npractices\
    \ are scheduled. The station location, longitude, latitude, elevation, climate\
    \ zones,\nand period of record for the available data needed for comparison are\
    \ shown in Table 3.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW \n8 of 21 \n \n\

    bias (Pbias), correlation coefﬁcient (r), the concordance index (d), and the Nash–Sutcliffe\n\

    \ by experimenting in the Bekaa Valley, the food\nbasket of Lebanon. This valley\
    \ is one of the country’s most important agricultural produc-\ntion areas where\
    \ water-use estimates are critical for water management and resilience [47].\n\
    The primary driver threatening farmers to use less irrigation water for food production\n\
    is the valley’s growing water constraint. The experimental ﬁeld (1-ha) is located\
    \ at the\nAgriculture Research and Education Center at AREC and planted with a\
    \ potato crop during\n12 March–15 July 2020: the growing season. The ﬁeld was\
    \ irrigated with a micro-sprinkler\nsystem (5 × 5 spacing at 200 L/h for a sprinkler)\
    \ using the AgSAT-app irrigation recom-\nmendations. Irrigations were set at 4–5\
    \ day intervals with timings populated from the\nAgSAT app. The irrigation scheduling\
    \ experiment consisted of four plots of equal size.\nEach plot had its own ﬂow\
    \ meter installed on the laterals to monitor the amount of water\nirrigated. The\
    \ main weather parameters were taken from a Delta-T Devices weather station\n\
    located upwind within the ﬁeld and used to calculate ETref by the FAO Penman–Monteith\n\
    standard approach. Water lost due to wind drift and evaporation was estimated\
    \ using a\ncatch-can test at the beginning of the irrigation season. In addition,\
    \ soil moisture and crop\nyield measurements were held. A deep soil-water sensor\
    \ at 60 cm was installed to monitor\ndeep percolation.\n4. Results and Discussion\n\
    4.1. Global Validation\nAgSAT daily ETref aligned with the in situ measurements\
    \ of reference evapotranspira-\ntion from 18 weather stations (n = 46385) worldwide.\
    \ Daily ETref was reasonably predicted\nby the AgSAT model, as suggested by the\
    \ relatively low spread of most points in the scatter\nplots, close to the 1:1\
    \ line (Figure 4). Generally, RMSE was relatively low (1.27 mm/d), with\na very\
    \ small percentage of error (Pbias) (0.5%) driven by a slight positive bias (0.02\
    \ mm/d).\nThe NSE value of 0.79 shows that the AgSAT model can be classiﬁed as\
    \ acceptable. The\nconcordance index (d) approaches 1, indicating very good agreement\
    \ between AgSAT ETref\nand station ETref. The comparative analysis of the AgSAT\
    \ and the weather stations’ daily\nreference evapotranspiration at a site level\
    \ is shown in Figure A1, colored by climate type.\nAdditional accuracy statistics\
    \ are shown in Table A2 at a site level, including MAE, MBE,\nRE, and MAPE. Accuracy\
    \ statistics of AgSAT ETref comparison with station ETref at the\n18 studied sites\
    \ by climate are shown in Figure A2.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 5090\n11 of 22\n\
    \ \nany substantial Pbias in the AgSAT ETref estimation at all sites where Pbias\
    \ remained \nbelow 23%. AgSAT ETref was further evaluated across climatic zones.\
    \ The ETref model \nrevealed variability in model skill (Figure A2). The most\
    \ notable finding in group-wise \nanalysis based on climate was a general trend\
    \ in bias, with AgSAT ETref model underes-\ntimating ET in Dfb (humid continental)\
    \ climates and overestimating in humid subtropical \n(Cfa) climates. Based on\
    \ nearly all statistical measures, AgSAT ETref performed best in \nMediterranean\
    \ climates (Csa). \n \nFigure 4. AgSAT reference evapotranspiration comparison\
    \ with in situ measurements of reference \nevapotranspiration from 18 weather\
    \ stations. \n4.2. Field Validation \nThe total water applied during the irrigation\
    \ season was 590 mm. Water lost to wind \ndrift and evaporation was estimated\
    \ at 15–20% (depending on the irrigation time and \nwind speed) of applied water.\
    \ Total water reaching the soil was estimated at 487 mm. Soil \nwater content\
    \ at planting was at field capacity following an above-average rainfall at the\
    \ \nsite. The clay soil-available water in the root zone on 12 March 2020 was\
    \ 65 mm for 50 cm \nof the maximum potato root depth measured on-site for the\
    \ duration of the experiment. \nNo deep percolation was observed during the duration\
    \ of the experiment. The amount of \nwater used by the crop was estimated at 521\
    \ mm. The AgSAT app calculated a total ET of \n531 mm for the period May 1–July\
    \ 31. The resulting potato yield was 60 tons/ha from plot \n1, 53 tons/ha from\
    \ plots 2 and 3, and 46 tons/ha from plot 4 (due to weed infestations), \nindicating\
    \ a superb yield. Figure 5 shows the Kcb, ETref, and ETpot (potential evapotran-\n\
    spiration) derived from the app. The Kcb values matched those indicated for the\
    \ planted \npotato crop (Figure 6) [35]. \nFigure 4. AgSAT reference evapotranspiration\
    \ comparison with in situ measurements of reference\nevapotranspiration from 18\
    \ weather stations.\nThe plot shows that AgSAT ETref agrees very well with the\
    \ station ETref, with an\nindex of agreement ranging from 0.8 to 0.98. The highest\
    \ index of agreement was apparent\nin California and Lebanon, indicating the suitability\
    \ of AgSAT for use in semi-arid and\narid regions where agriculture relies on\
    \ irrigation water and where water is scarce. The\nlowest error was obtained at\
    \ the Ireland station (RMSE of 0.62 mm/d, driven by a slight\npositive bias of\
    \ −0.4 mm/d). The most signiﬁcant error was observed at the Adrar station\nin\
    \ Algeria, with the highest RMSE (2.29 mm/d), driven by a negative bias of −1.91\
    \ mm/d.\nAgSAT ETref tended in the opposite direction at a site level, where it\
    \ overestimated ETref at\nthe Rafha, KSA (by 23%) and underestimated ETref at\
    \ the Adrar, Algeria stations (by −22%).\nThis could be due to the site hyperaridity\
    \ where reference conditions were not met; no\nadjustments were made to correct\
    \ station data. Very good model skills were observed at\nmost of the stations\
    \ (e.g., most of the stations such as Monastir, Tunisia, Aguas Emendadas,\nBrazil,\
    \ and Roches point, Ireland have very low mean bias error). We did not ﬁnd any\n\
    substantial Pbias in the AgSAT ETref estimation at all sites where Pbias remained\
    \ below 23%.\nAgSAT ETref was further evaluated across climatic zones. The ETref\
    \ model revealed\nvariability in model skill (Figure A2). The most notable ﬁnding\
    \ in group-wise analysis\nbased on climate was a general trend in bias, with AgSAT\
    \ ETref model underestimating ET\nin Dfb (humid continental) climates and overestimating\
    \ in humid subtropical (Cfa) climates.\nBased on nearly all statistical measures,\
    \ AgSAT ETref performed best in Mediterranean\nclimates (Csa).\n4.2. Field Validation\n\
    The total water applied during the irrigation season was 590 mm. Water lost to\
    \ wind\ndrift and evaporation was estimated at 15–20% (depending on the irrigation\
    \ time and wind\nspeed) of applied water. Total water reaching the soil was estimated\
    \ at 487 mm. Soil water\ncontent at planting was at ﬁeld capacity following an\
    \ above-average rainfall at the site. The\nclay soil-available water in the root\
    \ zone on 12 March 2020 was 65 mm for 50 cm of the\nmaximum potato root depth\
    \ measured on-site for the duration of the experiment. No deep\npercolation was\
    \ observed during the duration of the experiment. The amount of water used\nRemote\

    \ ETref\nThe AgSAT model uses gridded data to estimate ETref, which does not have\
    \ a small\nenough spatial resolution to best serve ETref estimation. For ETref\
    \ computations, weather\ndata should be collected over a reference surface as\
    \ deﬁned by ASCE-EWRI [48]. In arid\nareas with irrigated agriculture, the grid\
    \ cell size in the CFSV2 datasets used in the study\ncould extend well beyond\
    \ the weather station of interest. The grid cell would thereby\ncombine the microclimatic\
    \ conditions of an irrigated (representing reference conditions),\nand dry areas\
    \ (with non-reference conditions), possibly weakening the validity of the ETref\n\
    estimate. Another error anticipated in the gridded weather dataset is the assimilation\
    \ of\ndata. Overestimating temperature and underestimating humidity might occur\
    \ if irrigation\nand precipitation data are not used as assimilation input data,\
    \ especially in arid areas\nwhere irrigation is prevalent. This was noticed in\
    \ the arid-desert-hot (BWh) climate group,\nspeciﬁcally at the Rafha, KSA station\
    \ where AgSAT overestimated the ETref.\nAdditionally, AgSAT ETref is overestimated\
    \ in the humid subtropical climate zone\nspotted in the Indian River, Florida\
    \ station. Gao [49] mentioned that the Penman–Monteith\nmethod is unsuitable for\
    \ high humidity settings because of the linear assumption of\nsaturated vapor\
    \ pressure and air temperature. To maintain errors of less than 10–15%,\nGrignon\
    \ [50] recommended using non-linear equations in extreme conditions (high humid-\n\
    ity). In humid climates, condensation occurs during the night, leading to an overestimated\n\
    VPD [35], leading to a higher ETref.\nMoreover, the CFSV2 datasets generally represent\
    \ the weather conditions at the aver-\nage elevation of the grid cell. However,\
    \ air temperature can change rapidly with elevation\nat an average lapse rate\
    \ of −6.5 ◦C per 1000 m gained [51], leading to some misrepresen-\ntation of ETref\
    \ in areas with complex terrain if the gridded weather temperatures are not\n\
    adjusted to the weather station elevations. Nevertheless, AgSAT was designed to\
    \ work in\nagricultural areas with simple topography.\nGridded weather data also\
    \ pose a challenge due to their temporal resolution. CFSV2\nhas a coarse temporal\
    \ resolution of 6 h, which might be insufﬁcient for representing\nthe substantial\
    \ variation of the four weather parameters (air temperature, wind speed,\nhumidity,\
    \ and solar radiation) during a day, potentially reducing the accuracy of ETref\n\
    estimation. This was indicated by Hupet and Vanclooster [52], who found that errors\
    \ in\ndaily grass ETref can be as large as 27% even when an hourly sampling rate\
    \ is used.\nSome of the selected weather stations in the study are located at\
    \ or next to airports\nwhere paved surfaces are prevalent. In such surface type,\
    \ measured temperature and\nhumidity might be higher due to little to no moisture\
    \ available to vaporize and high energy\nto heat the air. Among these stations\
    \ are the Adrar, Algeria, and Kamishly, Syria, stations\nwhere AgSAT underestimated\
    \ the ETref. Both weather station and gridded data have in-\nherent errors and\
    \ uncertainties in a comparable matter. The weather station measurements\ntypically\
    \ have errors of 20–30% [53,54], as large as the gridded data errors [55]. The\
    \ gridded\nweather datasets overestimate standardized Penman–Monteith ETref from\
    \ weather stations\nby as much as 20–30% [56]. Other causes of error are related\
    \ to the scale and geolocation\nmismatch (a partial overlap between the area overlap\
    \ footprint of remote sensing vs. point\nmeasurements) [53,57].\nFuture research\
    \ could pursue the bias correction for the gridded weather data or\ndecreasing\
    \ ETref bias directly through statistical models or the use of theoretical adjustments\n\
    based on the surface to air proﬁles for temperature, wind, and humidity, as described\n\
    by [35,58]. Debiasing gridded data would allow the data to be used to its fullest\
    \ potential,\nbeneﬁting from temporal, spatial, and global coverage. Although\
    \ most of the used locations\nreliably produced low error without bias correction,\
    \ commonly, the gridded data requires\nbias correction in regions where a systematic\
    \ bias exists to improve their accuracy.\n4.5. Limitations and Future Work\nAs\
    \ with any technological advancement, the development and deployment of AgSAT\n\
    holds various limitations. Because AgSAT relies on vegetation reﬂectance data,\
    \ it is un-\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 5090\n16 of 22\nsuitable for greenhouse farms.\
    \ However, farmers who plant in greenhouses may still use\nthe weather data from\
    \ AgSAT and adjust them for greenhouse conditions. Jaafar and\nAhmad [59] provided\
    \ equations to derive in-greenhouse ET from outside ET and weather.\nCurrently,\
    \ AgSAT does not use a soil-water balance to derive irrigation schedules for farm-\n\
    ers, as this approach requires the farmers to input soil moisture data from ﬁeld\
    \ sensors. The\navailability of global gridded soil moisture at the ﬁeld level\
    \ is also another constraint. A\nsoil-water balance requires an estimate of irrigation,\
    \ rainfall, runoff, and deep percolation,\nall of which now cannot be calculated\
    \ or derived on the ﬂy. We plan to extend the app to\nread remotely sensed-based\
    \ soil moisture once this data becomes useful for agriculture.\nCurrently, only\
    \ very low-resolution gridded soil moisture data is available, which is not\n\
    very handy for ﬁeld-scale applications. Due to the limited availability of reliable\
    \ rainfall\ndata in real-time, users are encouraged to subtract rainfall amounts\
    \ from the irrigation\nwater requirements. We plan to add a rainfall dataset to\
    \ the model when such a dataset be-\ncomes available in higher resolution in Google\
    \ Earth Engine. However, the major strength\nof the app results from working conjointly\
    \ with farmers and irrigation managers during\nthe development of AgSAT, with\
    \ many features outlined and implemented based on their\nneeds and suggestions.\
    \ Despite the aforementioned constraints, AgSAT has been perform-\ning well since\
    \ its development, with many farmers relying on its guidance on irrigation\nquantities\
    \ and transitioning towards increasing water use efﬁciency in crop production.\n\
    Adjustments may be necessary in areas where local climate differs from gridded\
    \ weather\ndata due to complex topography or other speciﬁc micro-climatic conditions.\n\
    5. Conclusions\nThis paper presents a novel global smart irrigation app (AgSAT)\
    \ as an efﬁcient and\nsimple tool calculating crop water requirements in near\
    \ real-time. The android smartphone\napplication was developed using available\
    \ Google Earth Engine datasets of both gridded\nweather data and surface reﬂectance\
    \ satellite imagery for calculating reference evapotran-\nspiration and crop NDVI.\
    \ AgSAT was assessed at the small ﬁeld level for irrigating a potato\ncrop, and\
    \ the reference evapotranspiration parameter it relies on was validated globally\
    \ in\nvarious climatic zones in many countries. The main app metrics, crop evapotranspiration\n\
    referenced to grass as developed by the ASCE-standardized Penman–Monteith equation,\n\
    were calculated from global climatic data (CFSV2) and have shown very good agreement\n\
    with the corresponding ET calculated from weather stations worldwide. Local adjustments\n\
    may be needed in complex topographies and areas with their own microclimate. Our\n\
    validation, herein, showed that the estimated crop evapotranspiration for AgSAT\
    \ could be\nused reliably, enabling the applicability of the developed smart irrigation\
    \ app. Moreover,\nthe results presented in this study allowed concluding that\
    \ crop growth coefﬁcients can\nbe derived using the highest publicly available\
    \ resolution (EAS’s Sentinel-2 at 10 m) and\nwere shown to be valid for agricultural\
    \ crops in major agricultural regions, including the\nUSA (California). Coverage\
    \ remains a challenge in cloudy regions where crop phenol-\nogy changes quickly.\
    \ This can be addressed in the future by utilizing synthetic aperture\nRADAR imagery\
    \ such as Sentinel-1. This study sought to contribute to the topic of smart\n\
    technologies in irrigation and has demonstrated an illustrative example of an\
    \ app that cuts\nback on high costs and the challenges of computerized applications\
    \ for the technologically\nchallenged farmer. AgSAT brings irrigation technology\
    \ to the farmer’s phone and provides\nan opportunity for combatting water scarcity\
    \ and mitigating the impact of climate change\non the world’s dwindling water\
    \ resources.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, H.J.; methodology, H.J.;\

  explanation: 'Sociohydrology is a scientific discipline that studies the interactions
    between water and human systems. It is an interdisciplinary field that draws on
    the social and natural sciences to understand how water resources are used, managed,
    and affected by human activity.


    The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a set of 17 goals
    that were adopted by all United Nations member states in 2015. The SDGs cover
    a wide range of issues, including poverty, hunger, health, education, gender equality,
    and climate change. Many of the SDGs are directly or indirectly related to water,
    and sociohydrology can play a key role in helping to achieve these goals.


    For example, sociohydrology can help to:


    * Understand the social and environmental impacts of water scarcity and pollution

    * Develop more sustainable water management practices

    * Improve access to safe water and sanitation

    * Reduce the risk of water-related disasters

    * Promote water conservation and efficiency


    Sociohydrology is a relatively new field, but it has already made significant
    contributions to our understanding of water-human interactions. As the world faces
    increasingly complex water challenges, sociohydrology will become increasingly
    important in helping us to find sustainable solutions.'

    Abstract The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations Agenda
    2030 represent an ambitious blueprint to reduce inequalities globally and achieve
    a sustainable future for all mankind. Meeting the SDGs for water requires an integrated
    approach to managing and allocating water resources, by involving all actors and
    stakeholders, and considering how water resources link different sectors of society.
    To date, water management practice is dominated by technocratic, scenario-based
    approaches that may work well in the short term but can result in unintended consequences
    in the long term due to limited accounting of dynamic feedbacks between the natural,
    technical, and social dimensions of human-water systems. The discipline of sociohydrology
    has an important role to play in informing policy by developing a generalizable
    understanding of phenomena that arise from interactions between water and human
    systems. To explain these phenomena, sociohydrology must address several scientific
    challenges to strengthen the field and broaden its scope. These include engagement
    with social scientists to accommodate social heterogeneity, power relations, trust,
    cultural beliefs, and cognitive biases, which strongly influence the way in which
    people alter, and adapt to, changing hydrological regimes. It also requires development
    of new methods to formulate and test alternative hypotheses for the explanation
    of emergent phenomena generated by feedbacks between water and society. Advancing
    sociohydrology in these ways therefore represents a major contribution toward
    meeting the targets set by the SDGs, the societal grand challenge of our time.
    Key Points The crises that humanity faces over access to a clean water supply
    are increasingly connected and are growing in complexity Sociohydrology researchers

    Goals Plain Language Summary Water crises that humanity faces are increasingly
    connected and are growing in complexity. As such, they require a more integrated
    approach in managing water resources,which involves all actors and stakeholders
    and considers how water resources link different sectors of society. Yet, water
    management practice is still dominated by technocratic approaches, which emphasize
    technical solutions. While these approaches may work in the short-term, they often
    result in unintended consequences in the long-term. Sociohydrology is developing
    a generalizable understanding of the interactions and feedbacks between natural,technical
    and social processes, which can improve water management practice. As such, advancing
    sociohydrology can contribute to address the global water crises and meet the
    water-related targets defined by the United Nations'' Sustainable Development
    Goals. 1 Introduction: Water Crises, SDGs, and SocioHydrology In the Anthropocene
    era, increasing attention is given in hydrologic science and water management
    to notions of nonstationarity (e.g., stationarity is dead; Milly et al., 2008)
    and change (e.g., hydrology for a changing world; Wagener et al., 2010). Yet,
    in the context of human influences on climate and hydrology, neither nonstationarity
    nor change is new. As early as 2,500 years ago, the pre-Socratic Greek philosopher
    Heraclitus (circa 535–475 BCE) gained prominence for his emphasis on change as
    the fundamental essence of the universe. To express the concept that nothing is
    permanent except change, Heraclitus metaphorically referred to the change in the
    symbiotic relationship between water and people using the words No man ever steps
    in the same river twice, for it''s not the same river and he''s not the same man.
    The prescient insight of Heraclitus can equally well serve as a metaphor for many
    of the water-related issues humanity is currently facing worldwide. Millions of
    people around the world are affected by water crises manifesting at different
    scales, such as increasing drought severity and flood risk, groundwater depletion,
    ecological degradation, poor sanitation, water pollution, and its impact on human
    health (Srinivasan et al., 2012). A survey among water experts was recently carried
    out by the International Association of Hydrological Sciences (IAHS) to identify
    global hot spots of water crises (Figure 1). The results of the survey highlighted
    that most water crises are understood by experts as the result of lack of understanding,
    or neglect, of wider, economic, and socio-cultural perspectives (by scientists,
    policy makers, and water resource managers). This supports the case that the global
    water crisis is a governance crisis and thus political, economic, and cultural
    in nature (Castro, 2007). Figure 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Global hot
    spots of water crises identified by the IAHS Panta Rhei survey across water scientists
    and experts. The figure shows the social, technical, and hydrological factors
    identified by the respondents as main drivers of the six types of water crises
    around the world. IAHS = International Association of Hydrological Sciences. In
    the spirit of Heraclitus, therefore, the water crises can be deemed the intended
    and/or unintended consequences of long-term changes (i.e., slow evolution) of
    social norms and values (or, more broadly, culture), ideology or political systems,
    which are not typically anticipated or accounted for in coping with water-related
    issues. It is for this reason, and inspired by Heraclitus himself, that the global,
    decadal (2013–2022) initiative of the IAHS was titled Panta Rhei-Everything Flows
    (McMillan et al., 2016; Montanari et al., 2013) and focuses on change in both
    hydrology and society. Sociohydrology engages with these principles (Sivapalan
    et al., 2012, 2014), by examining the outcomes of water management and governance
    processes, that is, both successes and failures, themselves as subjects of scientific
    study. Sociohydrology studies the two-way feedbacks between human and water systems
    that result in a wide range of phenomena that arise in different places around
    the world and in different contexts (Di Baldassarre et al., 2015; Gober & Wheater,
    2015; Pande & Savenije, 2016; Sivapalan & Blöschl, 2015; Srinivasan, 2015; Srinivasan
    et al., 2012; Troy, Pavao-Zuckerman, & Evans, 2015). Work in sociohydrology has
    built upon a long history of work in three related fields. The first (1) is water
    resources systems (WRS) analysis that started with the Harvard Water Program in
    the 1960s (Brown et al., 2015; Kasprzyk et al., 2018) where the focus has mainly
    been on decision support by following a normative (optimization) route. The second
    (2) is integrated water resources management (IWRM), which was introduced in the
    1990s and was more geared to actual implementation (Global Water Partnership,
    2009) by (i) involving integration across the entire hydrological cycle; (ii)
    accommodating different water users and including engineering, economic, social,
    ecological, and legal aspects; while (iii) accounting for multiple spatial scales,
    such as upstream/downstream perspectives. The third (3) is the more recent development
    of interdisciplinary frameworks exploring the mutual shaping of society and nature
    (including water), such as social-ecological systems, coupled human-nature systems,
    and complex systems science (e.g., Adger, 2006; Cosens et al., 2018; Folke, 2006,
    2010; Folke et al., 2010; Gohari et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2007; Loucks, 2015;
    Ostrom, 2009; Walker et al., 2004; Werner & McNamara, 2007). While building on
    these fields, sociohydrology is different from them. WRS (1) analysis is focused
    on optimization. The goal is to combine hydrology and economics to design and
    operate optimal infrastructure projects. In contrast, the focus of sociohydrology
    is on understanding why certain water management outcomes arise rather than proposing
    actual management solutions. Similarly, IWRM (2) prescribes how to manage water
    resources in specific contexts, while sociohydrology analyzes actual water management
    processes and outcomes to develop generalizable understanding. Unlike social-ecological
    systems and coupled human-nature systems (3), sociohydrology has a more explicit
    focus on water, and on the specifics of the hydrologic cycle in space and time
    (Konar et al., 2018), including the role of water infrastructure (Di Baldassarre,
    Kemerink, et al., 2014; Di Baldassarre, Kreibich, et al., 2018). Over the past
    6 years, sociohydrology has pursued understanding of several classes of emergent
    phenomena, which are actual outcomes, paradoxical dynamics, or unintended consequences
    that arise from water management in the context of human-flood, human-drought,
    and human-environment interactions (Pande & Sivapalan, 2017; Sivapalan & Blöschl,
    2015). This paper argues that the development of generalized understanding of
    socio-hydrological phenomena has an important role to play in informing policy
    processes and in assisting communities, governments, civil society organizations,
    and private actors as they mobilize to meet the United Nations Agenda 2030 and
    its Sustainable Development Goals, hereafter SDGs (United Nations, UN, 2015).
    The SDGs represent an ambitious blueprint to achieve a sustainable future for
    humanity, and address global challenges related to, among others, poverty, inequality,
    climate change, environmental degradation, and water (Death & Gabay, 2015; Fukuda-Parr,
    2016). Achieving the SDGs is urgent, and 193 nations have committed to meet the
    targets set by the United Nations by 2030. The SDG 6, ensuring availability and
    sustainable management of water and sanitation for all is probably the greatest
    challenge we face in water resources management (UN Water, 2018). However, water
    plays a key role in several of the other SDGs as well and, therefore, water management
    must account for these multiple interrelated objectives (either in synergy or
    in conflict), not just focusing on clean water and sanitation. SDG 6 (and other
    related SDGs) is strongly committed to the IWRM paradigm (UN Water, 2016). This,
    it is argued, requires governments to consider how water resources link different
    parts of society and how decisions in one sector may affect water users in other
    sectors, as well as to adopt a participatory and inclusive approach by involving
    all actors and stakeholders, from all levels, who use and potentially pollute
    water, so that it is managed equitably and sustainably. (UN Water, 2018). Meeting
    the UN SDGs is, however, not straightforward. The targets set by the different
    SDGs are interrelated (UN Water, 2018), and they are sometimes fuzzy, contradictory,
    or challenging to implement (Sultana, 2018). For example, efforts to achieve the
    targets for clean water and sanitation can have unintended consequences on food
    and energy security and can contribute to environmental degradation. In the backdrop
    of these challenges, much of the current water management practice is still grounded
    on a strong techno-managerial culture, focused more on technocratic approaches
    than on addressing the socio-political and cultural dimensions underlying water
    crises, and the uneven distribution of costs and benefits (Hussein et al., 2018;
    Weststrate et al., 2018). Also, IWRM typically uses a scenario-based approach
    to account for human-water interactions (Savenije & Van der Zaag, 2008), which
    can work in the short term but in the long term can result in unintended consequences
    of only partially accounting for the coevolutionary dynamics of coupled human-water
    systems (Di Baldassarre, Kooy, et al., 2013; Di Baldassarre, Viglione, et al.,
    2013; Di Baldassarre et al., 2015; Gohari et al., 2013; Sivapalan et al., 2012,
    2014; Srinivasan et al., 2012). We posit that the field of sociohydrology has
    the potential to bridge the gap between the broad SDGs and the more specific IWRM/WRS
    set of principles and methodologies by seeking to gain insights that are both
    generalizable and actionable. Sociohydrology has an important role to play by
    emphasizing the need to broaden the conversation concerning water-related issues
    so that they are addressed (i) holistically and inclusively, considering broader,
    socio-cultural, and socio-political perspectives; and (ii) by considering both
    short-term and long-term consequences of shifts in water governance. This paper
    surveys the scientific challenges faced by sociohydrology toward addressing the
    complex water management challenge identified above. We start by documenting and
    synthesizing socio-hydrological phenomena explored to date and the generalized
    understanding gained so far. Next, we discuss and highlight the scientific and
    methodological challenges that remain, and the opportunities toward integrating
    the social and hydrological sciences. This is essential for strengthening the
    field of sociohydrology, and broadening its scope to underpin IWRM and support
    policy makers, governments, communities, and private sector organizations toward
    meeting the SDGs, which looms as a major societal grand challenge of the 21st
    century. 2 The Role of SocioHydrology in Conceptualizing the Water Implications
    of the SDGs 2.1 Classification of Phenomena Humans have significantly influenced
    the hydrological regime (Falkenmark & Rockström, 2008; Vörösmarty et al., 2013),
    deliberately or not (Blöschl et al., 2013; Savenije et al., 2014). Meanwhile,
    hydrological change tends to shape human society (Di Baldassarre et al., 2017),
    which responds to water crises, droughts, and floods in multiple ways, formally
    or not (Adger et al., 2013). The bidirectional feedbacks between human and water
    systems generate patterns across places or even across different contexts, which
    are the phenomena of interest to sociohydrology. These phenomena are actual outcomes,
    paradoxical dynamics, or unintended consequences that arise from water management
    to achieve a desired societal objective. They can result from the prevailing of
    political, commercial, or financial interests that might exacerbate social inequalities
    and ineffectiveness in water management. In this sense, they might be considered
    as manifestations of mismatch of governance with the (time, space, or organizational)
    scale of the coupled human-water system being governed (Cash et al., 2006) or
    of governance processes thick with politics (Castro, 2007). Such ignorance and
    mismatch can arise when governance is based on myopic, reductionist, or one-size-fits-all
    thinking. Sociohydrology aims to understand the feedback mechanisms generating
    these phenomena and the power relations, trust, cultural beliefs, and cognitive
    biases, which strongly influence the way in which people alter, and adapt to,
    changing hydrological regimes. The ultimate goal is to prevent mismatches of governance,
    in the first place, or at least overcome their adverse effects. Much of sociohydrology
    research has focused on the explanation of phenomena that have arisen in the context
    of floods (Di Baldassarre, Viglione, et al., 2013,Di Baldassarre, Kooy, et al.,
    2013, Di Baldassarre, Kemerink, et al., 2014,Di Baldassarre, Yan, et al., 2014;
    Di Baldassarre et al., 2015; Viglione et al., 2014; Grames et al., 2016; Ciullo
    et al., 2017; Barendrecht et al., 2019), droughts (Garcia et al., 2016; Srinivasan
    et al., 2017; Gonzales & Ajami, 2017; Di Baldassarre et al., 2017; Di Baldassarre,
    Kreibich, et al., 2018,Di Baldassarre, Wanders, et al., 2018; Treuer et al., 2017;
    Breyer et al., 2018), groundwater exploitation (Marston & Konar, 2017; Noël &
    Cai, 2017), water quality degradation (Chang et al., 2014; Giuliani et al., 2016),
    land degradation (Elshafei et al., 2014, 2016), farming and agriculture development
    (Fernald et al., 2015; Pande & Savenije, 2016), and water resources development
    (e.g., Chen et al., 2016; Kandasamy et al., 2014; Mostert, 2018; Srinivasan et
    al., 2012). Several studies have attributed the collapse or dispersal of ancient
    civilizations to unintended effects in water management or governance (e.g., Dermody
    et al., 2014; Kuil et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2013; Pande & Ertsen, 2014). Many
    of the phenomena studied to date manifest in the time domain. However, there is
    increased interest in phenomena that manifest in the space domain or in space-time
    (Breyer et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2016), as also highlighted in the recent review
    by Konar et al. (2018). Much can be learned by comparing and contrasting phenomena
    that arise in different places and in different contexts, and by seeking common
    explanations. This can be done by organizing them into groups of similar behavior,
    as was earlier done in terms of syndromes by Srinivasan et al. (2012) in the context
    of water resource development. We next present several classes of socio-hydrologic
    phenomena (Table 1) that have been explored over the last 6 years, providing the
    diversity of causes and contexts with which to generate understanding of coupled
    human-water system dynamics and to help meet several water-related SDG targets
    (see Figure 2). Table 1. Overview of Socio-Hydrological Phenomena and Implications

    Figure 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Water plays a key role in several specific
    targets of the SDGs, which are interconnected with socio-hydrological phenomena.
    The SDGs thus provide further motivation and the necessity to broaden the scope
    and strengthen the foundation of sociohydrology, which requires integration of
    hydrological and social science perspectives. SDGs = Sustainable Development Goals.
    According to the United Nations Office of Disaster Risk Reduction 2017 annual
    report (United Nations Office of Disaster Risk Reduction, UNISDR, 2018), capturing
    disaster risk dynamics is essential to achieve several SDGs. Shocks and stresses
    caused by disasters are likely to frustrate development achievements, and, in
    turn, bad development determines risk accumulation. Several SDGs are concerned
    with challenges that are related to risk accumulation, such as poverty (SDGs 1),
    reduction of inequalities (SDG 10), climate action (SDG 13), and peace, justice,
    and strong institutions (SDG 16). Sociohydrology has undertaken much work to understand
    feedbacks between society and hydrological extremes, such as droughts and flood.
    This work has advanced our understanding of the safe-development paradox or levee
    effect. This phenomenon describes instances in which protection measures, such
    as levees, generate a false sense of security (Ludy & Kondolf, 2012) and build
    up social vulnerabilities in risky areas (Burton & Cutter, 2008). As a result,
    paradoxically, risk can even increase after building such structural protection
    measures (Di Baldassarre, Kreibich, et al., 2018). Considering this phenomenon
    is crucial to meet numerous SDGs (Figure 2). The levee effect, for example, shows
    that the target of reducing fatalities caused by water-related disasters, such
    as floods (Target 11.5), cannot be achieved by merely building or reinforcing
    flood protection structures, but it requires a combination of nonstructural measures
    aiming to reduce vulnerabilities, including building codes or early warning systems
    (Kreibich et al., 2017). The safe-development paradox was first identified by
    Gilbert White as early as the 1940s (White, 1945), who criticized heavy reliance
    on structural flood protection in the United States. A recent example is the case
    of New Orleans, where a self-reinforcing process of raising levees to protect
    a growing urban environment has taken place over many decades (Kates et al., 2006).
    This has led to extreme, low-probability flooding, with catastrophic consequences,
    which are not evenly distributed across space and social groups. Masozera et al.
    (2007), for instance, analyzed the impact of flooding in New Orleans and found
    that preexisting socio-economic conditions played a major role in the inability
    of particular social groups to respond to the disaster and to cope with the flooding.
    Di Baldassarre, Wanders, et al. (2018) recently discussed the corresponding reservoir
    effect in the context of responses to droughts, showing how the safe-development
    paradox can equally well apply to water supply reservoirs. These are often built
    to alleviate droughts and water shortages, but they can eventually worsen them.
    It is important to note that societies are not homogeneous and social stratification
    determines how and who are affected by hydrological extremes as well as who comes
    up with the strategies to cope with change at different scales, that is, how hydrological
    risks are distributed. This was recently demonstrated in the city of Austin, Texas,
    in the context of water restrictions imposed by the city in response to a severe
    drought (Breyer et al., 2018). Dams, reservoirs, or other types of water infrastructure
    are often built to cope with drought and water scarcity. In the short-term, these
    human alterations of water storage and fluxes are often beneficial, as they can
    increase water supply. Yet increasing water supply enables additional urban, agricultural,
    or economic growth that in turn generates higher demand, which can then offset
    the benefits of, for example, reservoirs as water supply sources. This phenomenon,
    known as supply-demand cycle (Kallis, 2010), is a self-reinforcing feedback, or
    vicious cycle, as the occurrence of a new drought will then likely favor further
    expansion of, for example, reservoirs to increase water supply (Di Baldassarre,
    Wanders, et al., 2018). Similar dynamics generated by water transfer projects
    in Iran have been described as fixes that can backfire (Gohari et al., 2013).
    It is important to acknowledge the role of social stratification and spatial distribution
    of water supply in terms of how and who makes decisions to build or expand water
    infrastructure, and who actually benefits from the increased water supply, as
    well as how the costs and benefits are distributed (Merme et al., 2014; Molle
    et al., 2009; Tiwale et al., 2018). This phenomenon has many implications for
    numerous SDGs (Figure 2), including the implementation of IWRM (Target 6.5). Humans
    respond and adapt to hydrological extremes through a combination of spontaneous
    processes and deliberate strategies (Loucks et al., 2006, 2008) that can lead
    to, for example, changing the social contract (Adger et al., 2013). Adaptive responses
    can take place at the individual, community, or government level. They might lead
    to the emergence of the adaptation effect, that is, the negative impact of an
    extreme event tends to be lower if such an event occurs shortly after a similar
    one (Di Baldassarre et al., 2015; Kreibich et al., 2017). For instance, the economic
    losses of the 1995 Meuse River flooding in Central Europe were remarkably lower
    than those of 1993, even though the magnitudes of the two events were similar
    (Wind et al., 1999). Similarly, adaptation effects and decreasing flood fatalities
    have been observed in Bangladesh over the past decades (Kreibich et al., 2017;
    Mechler & Bouwer, 2015). While the adaptation effect is often associated with
    desirable outcomes, it can also have adverse consequences. Adaptation to drought
    conditions can exacerbate the negative impacts of floods, and vice versa (Di Baldassarre
    et al., 2017). For instance, changing reservoir operations to cope with drought,
    such as keeping the reservoirs as full as possible to buffer low flow conditions,
    can prevent required flood attenuation if heavy rainfall occurs during drought
    termination. This was seen, for example, during the catastrophic 2011 flooding
    in Brisbane that occurred shortly after the Millennium Drought in Australia or
    the extreme heavy rainfall causing the Oroville spillway collapse during the termination
    of the last multiyear drought in California (Mallakpour et al., 2019). Di Baldassarre
    et al. (2017) suggested that human migration from drought-affected areas, as seen
    for example in Somalia (World Bank, 2018), can lead to more people living in riparian
    areas and therefore more exposed to flooding. Many communities (be they agricultural
    or urban) that rely on river flow and/or groundwater to advance their economic
    livelihoods have been observed to swing between water extraction for food production
    or water control for urban development in the early stages, followed by efforts
    to mitigate and reverse degradation of the riparian environment, resulting from
    reduction of streamflows or depletion of groundwater. This is variously known
    as pendulum swing. This phenomenon was observed in the Murrumbidgee River basin
    in eastern Australia (Kandasamy et al., 2014), Lake Toolibin basin in Western
    Australia (Elshafei et al., 2014, 2016), and the Tarim basin in western China
    (Liu et al., 2015). In all three cases, increased water extraction, land clearance,
    and construction of water infrastructure are equally accompanied and driven by
    population growth and economic gain. In the short and intermediate terms, as per
    capita economic gain increases, the basin presents an attractive lifestyle proposition,
    causing human migration into the basin. In the long term, however, human actions
    that advance economic prosperity continue until the quantity or quality of water
    resources and the state of environment begin to impede further growth through
    the cost of environmental degradation and reduced productivity (Kandasamy et al.,
    2014). As the degradation of the environment continues, economic growth will naturally
    become constrained and communities will be compelled to act in efforts to reverse
    the negative threat to their livelihoods and well-being. In many arid regions
    of the world, water shortage most severely restricts socio-economic development.
    Under such circumstances, developing highly efficient agriculture through water-saving
    technology is regarded as an effective method to expand the economy, conserve
    water, and protect the environment. A range of technologies to increase irrigation
    efficiency and save water has proven successful at the farm scale. Yet, in the
    absence of appropriate governance measures, the increased efficiency often presents
    a paradox when assessed at larger scales because the saved water is often reallocated
    to irrigating an expanded land area or transferred to other uses (e.g., industrial
    or municipal water use), thus only to increase water consumption and deprive ecosystems
    of much needed flows. These are the unintended consequences arising from the push
    toward technological solutions without consideration of broader socio-cultural
    behaviors and their consequences. This is known as the irrigation efficiency paradox
    and can be seen as a facet of an economic rebound effect or Jevons paradox (Alcott,
    2005; Jevons, 1866). Increasing the efficiency of irrigation often leads to higher
    consumption of water, because farmers switch to more profitable and water-consuming
    crops (Dumont et al., 2013). An example is the coupled use of water and energy
    in Mexico, where efficient and subsidized electricity supplied to pump groundwater
    for irrigation had the unintended effect of increasing the pumping, thus speeding
    up aquifer depletion (Scott, 2011; Scott et al., 2013). Similarly, in the Xinjiang
    Uygur Autonomous Region in western China, total water consumption continued to
    increase even as irrigation efficiency dramatically improved through the application
    of water-saving technology (e.g., plastic mulching). However, the securing of
    additional freshwater resources through increased efficiency only encouraged farmers
    to expand the land area brought under irrigation, negating much of the water savings
    obtained through mulching (Liu, 2016; Zhang et al., 2014). This phenomenon is
    connected to numerous SDGs (Figure 2). Its emergence clearly complicates, for
    example, the goal of upgrading infrastructure to increase resource use efficiency
    (Target 9.4). Other socio-hydrological phenomena include what we term here as
    the aggregation effect and institutional complexity. The former relates to a mismatch
    of outcomes at the aggregated level of decisions taken at the individual level.
    A key example is known as collective action problem in the social sciences, which
    refers to situations where all individuals would be better off by jointly acting
    toward a common goal but fail to do so because of their self-interest (Olson,
    1965). This paradox originates from the common-pool resource nature of water resources
    and the public good nature of water infrastructure and the combination of individual
    rationality and difficulties associated with coordination of large groups (Kollock,
    1998). If overlooked, this issue can lead to outcomes such as overuse of groundwater
    and under provision of water infrastructure. To cope with this issue, rules and
    norms that regulate individual behavior need to be endogenously developed by the
    community or imposed on it endogenously (Ostrom, 1990). However, whether and how
    such governance arrangements can be achieved is itself a major challenge. Ostrom
    herself suggested in recent work (see, for instance, Van Laerhoven & Ostrom, 2007)
    that furthering common property resource management requires dealing with the
    uncertainty and complexity of institutional processes. Concurrently, over the
    past two decades, critical institutionalism has highlighted how the dynamic relationship
    between individuals, society, and natural resources is shaped by power relations
    and constant renegotiations that fuse socially embedded norms with new arrangements
    through a process of bricolage (Cleaver & De Koning, 2015; Rusca et al., 2015).
    Getting institutions right and development by design are, therefore, likely to
    lead to unintended outcomes (Cleaver, 2017). Feedbacks among the states of water
    resources, individual behavior, and change in governance arrangements can generate
    dynamics that are difficult to understand by treating water and human systems
    separately. Socio-hydrological studies dealing with this phenomenon include the
    management of water infrastructure in relation to flooding (Yu, Sangwan, et al.,
    2017), irrigation (Muneepeerakul & Anderies, 2017; Yu et al., 2015), and groundwater
    exploitation (Madani & Dinar, 2012; Müller et al., 2017). Aggregation effects
    could also produce perverse outcomes. These, for instance, occur when desirable
    outcomes at a larger scale conceal inequalities and, as such, distributional injustices
    at the local scale (Zwarteveen et al., 2017). A study on drinking water by Tiwale
    et al. (2018) found that additional reservoirs built to supply water for the underserved
    or unserved population of Lilongwe (Malawi) ended up improving continuity of supply
    for those who were already served, rather than quenching the thirst of the growing
    urban population. While at the urban scale water availability had improved, inequalities
    in access between different neighborhoods had increased. This example illustrates
    the limits of focusing on average values, while overlooking distribution across
    space and social groups. To determine whether anyone is left behind, as called
    for by the SDGs, requires disaggregated data, spanning from socio-economic status,
    gender, age, and geographic location (Satterthwaite, 2016a, 2016b; Stuart & Woodroffe,
    2016). As further elaborated below, sociohydrology can contribute to address important
    questions of equity by examining how development of large water infrastructure,
    such as reservoirs, and access to extra water intersects with gender, race, and
    socio-economic status. These effects are also central to the three paradoxes identified
    in the most recent World Water Development Report (UN Water, 2019): (1) supplying
    the bulk of food and yet poor and hungry; (2) substantive investments in water
    infrastructure in rural areas and yet the rural poor lack access to water; and
    (3) small-holder farmers being water productive and yet overlooked. The institutional
    complexity effect relates to the trade-off between resilience and efficiency of
    human-water systems (Muneepeerakul & Anderies, 2017) generated by increased complexities
    of shared water infrastructure and related governance arrangements. Measures that
    increase performance and stability are preferred by managers. As such, coupled
    human-water systems often evolve in ways that add more complex infrastructure
    and governance arrangements to reduce hydrological variability and increase system
    performance (Anderies, 2015). However, historical events showed that such complexities
    are often associated with hidden vulnerabilities to other types of disturbances,
    which are revealed through catastrophic failures (ibid). This line of inquiry
    has mostly focused on endogenous growth in the Indus and Hohokam civilizations
    (Pande & Ertsen, 2014) and virtual water trade in the Roman Empire (Dermody et
    al., 2014). Complex systems literature refers to this phenomenon as robustness-fragility
    trade-off (Csete & Doyle, 2002). Overall, the phenomena discussed above provide
    significant insights into human-water interactions at different temporal and spatial
    scales. These phenomena have clear implications for SDGs and can inform policies
    and strategies to achieve water-related targets (Figure 2). 2.2 Explanation of
    the Phenomena One of the main goals of sociohydrology is to explore the feedback
    mechanisms that may have caused the emergent phenomena. The driving logic of scientific
    discovery in sociohydrology is if these feedback mechanisms operate, here is the
    phenomenon it can produce as well as if this phenomenon happens, here are the
    feedback mechanisms that might explain it (Elster, 2007). A suite of different
    methods has been utilized in various studies to provide these explanations. One
    common approach adopted in the social sciences is the use of statistical analysis
    of empirical research data, obtained through surveys and interviews (Brown, 2007;
    Daniel et al., 2018; Sanderson et al., 2017), some of which is qualitative. In
    this context, a set of interesting methods has been developed that combine the
    strengths of qualitative and quantitative data (Driscoll et al., 2007; Jick, 1979).
    An example is the work by Leong (2018) to convert narratives of perceptions of
    floods in Assam, India, to quantitative forms, similar to water volumes and prices,
    using the so-called Q methodology. A second approach to explain phenomena, especially
    in the absence of long time series of observations, which has gathered increased
    momentum, is agent-based modeling (Du et al., 2017; Noël & Cai, 2017). These models
    operate by prescribing rules on how individuals and/or institutions (the agents)
    interact, obtained through field surveys and interviews of people in real places,
    and thus allow the heterogeneous individual (or group) behavior to be accommodated.
    They help to compute the interactions at the microlevel between agents and allow
    describing social behaviors at the macrolevel or to interpret observed behavior
    at these higher levels and attribute them to both microscale and macroscale factors
    (Gilbert, 2008; Gilbert & Terna, 2000). A third common approach, called system
    dynamics modeling (e.g., Di Baldassarre, Viglione, et al., 2013; Garcia et al.,
    2016; Gohari et al., 2013; Srinivasan, 2015) is adopted in the presence of long
    time series of natural or water system behavior (e.g., hydrology, water use, and
    ecology) and social system behavior (e.g., demographics, economics, industries,
    and technology). The approach is guided by a limited number of hypotheses about
    fundamental natural and social processes and their interactions driving the overall
    behavior of the system, as illustrated by a stylized model for an urban socio-hydrological
    system of Chennai, India, developed by Srinivasan (2015). More commonly, though,
    these hypotheses are explicitly formalized (in mathematical terms) using a set
    of coupled differential equations. Di Baldassarre et al. (2015) argue that the
    strength of this method is its transparency, flexibility, and ability to capture
    the dynamics emerging from interacting processes. Most early models of sociohydrology
    have been based on the system dynamics approach; see Blair and Buytaert (2016)
    and Troy, Pavao-Zuckerman, & Evans, 2015, Troy, Konar, et al., 2015) for comprehensive
    reviews of recent socio-hydrological models. These have been proposed as explanatory
    hypotheses about feedback mechanisms generating one or more observed classes of
    phenomena. The explanatory model depicted in Figure 3a, for example, is a (generic)
    system dynamics model, based on coupled differential equations (Di Baldassarre,
    Viglione, et al., 2013), that aims to explain, in a stylized manner, phenomena
    often observed in flood risk studies, that is, the aforementioned safe-development
    paradox and adaptation effect. In the same way, Figure 3b depicts a (place-based)
    conceptual model of the human-water dynamics in the Murrumbidgee River basin in
    eastern Australia, including the competition between humans and the environment
    (Van Emmerik et al., 2014) that underlies the pendulum swing phenomenon. Similar
    place-based models have been developed for the pendulum swing phenomena documented
    in Western Australia (Elshafei et al., 2014, 2016) and Tarim basin in western
    China (Liu et al., 2015). Figure 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Examples of
    socio-hydrological models as hypotheses about the feedback mechanisms generating
    one or more phenomena: (a) generic conceptualization of human-flood interactions
    (Di Baldassarre, Viglione, et al., 2013) and (b) coupled human-water dynamics
    in Murrumbidgee River basin (Van Emmerik et al., 2014). The endogenization of
    human agency is the key to explain emergent phenomena (Pande & Sivapalan, 2017).
    To this end, different hypotheses have been proposed in sociohydrology. Di Baldassarre,
    Viglione, et al. (2013); Di Baldassarre et al. (2015) and Viglione et al. (2014),
    for example, built upon the concept of social memory (Folke et al., 2005) and
    explained the safe-development paradox as resulting from a decay of flood memory
    during prolonged periods IN which flooding does not occur. In the same spirit,
    Van Emmerik et al. (2014), Liu et al. (2013), and Liu et al. (2015) explained
    the pendulum swing as the result of a competition between an economic productive
    force that favors human livelihoods and an environmental restorative force that
    favors the environment. As in Di Baldassarre, Viglione, et al. (2013), it was
    proposed that this competition was mediated by another social state variable,
    which Van Emmerik et al. (2014) termed an environmental awareness, and was later
    generalized by Elshafei et al. (2014) as community sensitivity. These social variables
    (e.g., social memory, community sensitivity) therefore played a central role in
    the development of associated coupled socio-hydrological models. Elshafei et al.
    (2014), and subsequently Elshafei et al. (2016), provided an avenue for generalization
    of community sensitivity by connecting it to broad socio-economic and socio-cultural
    factors (e.g., human development index and corruption perception index). Roobavannan
    et al. (2017) further enhanced the power of community sensitivity by making it
    a function of the structure of the regional economy. The resulting suite of system
    dynamics models using either social memory or community sensitivity as a key state
    variable to explain the emergence of socio-hydrological phenomena in effect have
    helped to endogenize human behavior and the feedbacks with the water system through
    deterministic human response relationships. For example, the migration of people
    out of, or toward, the Murrumbidgee River basin to or from other parts of eastern
    Australia was inspired by a law similar to Fick''s law of dispersal (i.e., migration
    flux is proportional to negative gradient of unemployment), while community sensitivity
    itself was defined as a trade-off between environmental health and economic well-being.
    Migrants are often driven by their expectation of improved employment or earnings
    (Mabogunje, 1970; Todaro, 1969). Aspirations of better lives are based on household
    level decisions to either maximize expected income or minimize risk that the household
    is exposed to by diversifying the portfolio of income generating activities (Massey
    et al., 1993; Akay et al., 2012). Yet the decisions to migrate are often limited
    by substantial social and economic barriers (Bryan et al., 2014). As a result,
    it is often the individuals whose income is above average that migrate (Knight
    & Gunatilaka, 2010). The effect of natural hazards such as droughts and flooding
    can therefore be ambiguous (Chen et al., 2017; Gray & Mueller, 2012). On the one
    hand, it can reduce migration by removing resources necessary for migration to
    overcome set up costs or increasing labor demand in originating areas, while in
    some other cases it may reduce all income generating possibilities, pushing migrants
    en masse out of affected areas (Chen et al., 2017). Therefore, while migration
    may appear to respond to unemployment gradient (Roobavannan et al., 2017), it
    is much more complex phenomenon that deserves closer scrutiny. There have also
    been early efforts to generalize from conclusions based on place-based studies.
    One of the ways to achieve this is to invoke (either explicitly or implicitly)
    existing economic or sociological theories to propose alternative hypotheses about
    the feedback mechanisms that contribute to the emergence of socio-hydrological
    phenomena. For example, Roobavannan et al. (2018) compared the outcomes of a socio-hydrologic
    model of community sensitivity (Elshafei et al., 2014, 2016) with an independent
    analysis of proxy data (i.e., references to concerns about the environment appearing
    in Australian newspapers over a 100-year period) carried out by Wei et al. (2017).
    Based on this analysis they argued that the concept of community sensitivity is
    consistent with the values beliefs norms theory widely adopted in sociology. Other
    socio-hydrological modeling studies have postulated human behavior as one that
    maximizes a livelihood objective. Pande et al. (2011), for example, modeled basin-scale
    water allocation based on profit maximization in agricultural production. Pande
    and Ertsen (2014) and Pande et al. (2014) provided an interpretation of the rise
    and dispersal of societies using endogenous growth theory, wherein actions of
    humans in maximizing their well-being result in the formation of grander coalitions
    (i.e., rise of civilizations) and technological progress that accelerates both
    growth and environmental degradation. Grames et al. (2016) provided an economic,
    albeit profit maximizing interpretation of the safe-development paradox. While
    these models assumed that humans are consistently able to compare and contrast
    alternative bundles of goods and services and maximize their well-being based
    on it (i.e., that they are rational), other approaches have been recently used
    to model apparently irrational behavior at individual and collective levels. Di
    Baldassarre et al. (2017), for instance, developed a system dynamics model by
    capturing cognitive biases at individual level in the management of droughts and
    floods, inspired by the idea of the availability heuristic in behavioral economics
    (Gal, 2018; Kahneman & Tversky, 1979). Yu et al. (2017) used evolutionary game
    theory to model the evolution of informal rules or norms of a community and associated
    collective action dynamics related to levee maintenance. Their model captures
    the social dilemma of how individually rational behavior can lead to collectively
    irrational outcome of poor levee maintenance as well as how the removal of short-term
    flooding can lead to erosion of people''s compliance to informal rules that regulate
    the social dilemma and, ultimately, erosion of community resilience to floods.
    Finally, Gunda et al. (2018) investigated the water stress response of the Valdez
    acequia in New Mexico (a community-managed irrigation system) by linking a hydrological
    model to the system dynamics model of an acequia developed by Turner et al. (2016).
    They focused on the role that community social structure, in particular mutualism,
    plays in the ability of the acequia to maintain its functionality. They found
    that, while agricultural productivity declined, the community was able to maintain
    its functionality under streamflow declines due to adaptations like shifting crop
    selection. The engagement with existing sociological and economic theories, and
    the development of new ones specific to sociohydrology, to provide explanations
    of observed socio-hydrologic phenomena is important to ascertain whether these
    are exceptional dynamics occurring in particular places or are generic ones that
    can be extrapolated to other places or circumstances. However, they take on added
    significance in the context of the SDGs since, in the absence of previous history,
    we will be expected to drive policy choices within which water resource development
    can be kept in the safe operating space for humanity (Rockström et al., 2009).
    Since coupled human-water systems are complex systems that involve dynamics at
    multiple levels of human organization (Sivapalan & Blöschl, 2015), multiple levels
    of theories are likely to be needed to more fully understand socio-hydrological
    phenomena. At individual level, promising theories of human behavior that remain
    insufficiently exploited in sociohydrology are the expected utility theory (Neumann
    & Morgenstern, 1944), protection motivation theory (Rogers, 1975), prospect theory
    (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979), game theory (Morrow, 1994), path dependency (Mahoney,
    2000), and rebound effect or Jevon''s paradox (Alcott, 2005). At collective level,
    applicable theories for explaining social change include collective action theory
    (Olson, 1965), institutionalist thinking (Cleaver, 2017; Ostrom, 1990; Van Laerhoven
    & Ostrom, 2007), and cultural evolution (Boyd & Richerson, 1985). Finally, at
    systems level, relevant theories could include resilience thinking (Walker et
    al., 2004), complex adaptive systems (Mitchell, 2009), metabolism theory (Banavar
    et al., 2002), and feedback control system theory (Doyle et al., 1990). 2.3 Reconceptualizing
    Water and Society Relations in the Context of SDGs According to several scholars
    working across disciplines, the United Nations SDGs mark a paradigm shift in the
    way nature and society relations are understood and addressed in human development.
    First, the SDGs promote the notion of coupled human-nature systems in which poverty
    reduction and planetary health are seen as intrinsically intertwined (Bello, 2013;
    Death & Gabay, 2015; Griggs et al., 2013; Langford, 2016; McMichael, 2017; Schleicher
    et al., 2018). It is argued that their transformative potential can only materialize
    if trade-offs and the relation between poverty and environmental degradation are
    made explicit (Schleicher et al., 2018). Second, the three dimensions of sustainability
    have been presented as an indivisible whole and scholars warn that a fragmented
    implementation would generate perverse outcomes (Morton et al., 2017; Nilsson
    et al., 2016). The nexus and trade-offs within the SDGs, however, have only been
    superficially explored in the past. If on the one hand enhancing policy coherence
    for sustainable development is a key concern in the SDGs project (Target 17.14.1),
    on the other hand most complex and politically contentious trade-offs have been
    glossed over in the international negotiations (Nilsson et al., 2016). Consequently,
    the multiple ways in which goals and dimensions of sustainability are interdependent
    are not explicitly discussed (Karlsson-Vinkhuyzen et al., 2018). As aptly illustrated
    by Alcamo (2019: 126), acting on synergies and trade-offs requires not only political
    will but also knowledge about their origin and characteristics. The risk, therefore,
    is that policy makers and bureaucrats end up working in vertical silos rather
    than through horizontal integrative approaches (Nilsson et al., 2016; Vandemoortele,
    2011). Increasingly, scholars call for enhancing empirical knowledge on trade-offs
    and synergies that can inform SDGs implementation processes. The UN''s report
    Mainstreaming of the three dimensions of sustainable development throughout the
    United Nations system (UN Economic & Social Council, 2016) places water as a key
    integration force and highlights the relationship between multiple goals. Sociohydrology
    can play an important role in conceptualizing SDG trade-offs and feedback loops
    in the context of water-society relations at different temporal and spatial scales.
    In section 3 we have shown how the body of literature that relates to sociohydrology
    has already theorized several phenomena that are relevant to the implementation
    of the SDGs. In the section that follows, we discuss opportunities to enrich sociohydrology
    by broadening its scope to address other water management dimensions relevant
    to the SDGs. 2.4 Expansion of Socio-Hydrologic Phenomena: Broadening the Scope
    of SocioHydrology Socio-hydrologic phenomena taken up for study over the last
    6 years have mostly examined human-flood, human-drought, and human-environment
    interactions and feedbacks. Yet the role of water in SDGs extends well beyond
    these. For example, water resources are connected to food and energy production.
    Excessive exploitation of water to produce food and energy contributes to environmental
    degradation in some places. Hence, in addition to competition for water between
    humans and the environment, managing water in a broader context requires decisions
    about different human-water uses (e.g., water vs food vs energy), or between different
    water hazards (e.g., floods vs droughts), both in time (e.g., short- vs long-term
    considerations) and in space (e.g., upstream vs downstream and urban vs rural).
    Below, we focus on three examples: water pollution and human health, water-energy-food
    nexus, and transboundary water management. 2.4.1 Water Pollution and Human Health
    Globally, population growth and economic development have contributed to increased
    contamination (e.g., heavy metals, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and fecal matter)
    of water supplies and of health risks related to waterborne diseases (Bain et
    al., 2014; Liu, Zhang, et al., 2017; Ternes et al., 2015). Although research on
    drinking water has overwhelmingly focused on use and access, a number of studies
    have examined contamination and its societal consequences and feedbacks at different
    scales. Work on the effects of coupled human-water systems on drinking water quality
    includes research on the arsenic crisis in South East Asia and Bangladesh, respectively,
    analyzing hydrology of geogenic arsenic groundwater and health implications (Winkel
    et al., 2008; Michael & Voss, 2008; Sultana, 2011), and the role of power and
    gendered relations in shaping access to contaminated water (Sultana, 2006). Another
    example is recent research on intermittent water supply, which has demonstrated
    how Escherichia coli contamination is more likely to occur in areas where supply
    is not continuous (Agathokleous & Christodoulou, 2016; Kumpel & Nelson, 2013).
    Over 300 million people globally are served by intermittent water supply, and
    those who live in areas with inadequate sanitation are at higher risk of drinking
    contaminated water (Kumpel & Nelson, 2016; Sarpong Boakye-Ansah et al., 2016).
    Risks of contamination are further exacerbated by storage practices adopted by
    residents to cope with discontinuity (Burt & Ray, 2014; Rusca et al., 2017). Improved
    sources are, thus, not necessarily free of pathogens and parasites and can cause
    waterborne diseases (Bain et al., 2014; Ercumen et al., 2015; Shaheed et al.,
    2014; Tosi Robinson et al., 2018). Although these studies have identified technical
    challenges and household coping strategies that might lead to contamination and
    the health implications thereof, in the context of the SDGs more work can be done
    to unravel the interplay between the political economy of water and sanitation
    services, water contamination at different scales, and distribution of its risks.
    A growing body of literature proposes that safe water has become a commodity and
    calls for examining the relation between deterioration of water quality, class,
    gender, race, and indigenous rights to water (Rusca, Alda-Vidal, et al., 2017,Rusca,
    Boakye-Ansah, et al., 2017; Dodman et al., 2017; Vandewalle & Jepson, 2015). These
    studies suggest that there is a trend of vulnerable and marginalized communities
    suffering the most from exposure to unsafe drinking water. Sociohydrology can
    contribute by capturing more explicitly the dynamics generated by the interweaving
    of human and water-quality transformations and the uneven distribution of risk
    through research on feedback loops between wastewater/sludge flows and society,
    including the economic, cultural, engineering, and human behaviors surrounding
    its mitigation and production at different scales. The recent water crisis in
    Flint (Michigan, USA), for instance, mostly affected urban dwellers of more economically
    depressed background. The study by Butler et al. (2016) importantly shows the
    relationship among urbanization, economic development, inequalities, politics
    of water management, and water contamination. Flint developed mostly because of
    a thriving motor industry, while toxic industrial effluents contaminated the Detroit
    River. The ending of industrial activities left the city impoverished and, more
    recently, under emergency management to deal with the economic hardship. When,
    in order to reduce costs, the water supply was temporarily switched from Lake
    Huron to the Detroit River, residents were exposed for over 18 months to lead
    contaminated water, which caused elevated blood lead levels in residents, with
    irreversible impacts on children (Hanna-Attisha et al., 2016; Liu, Zhang, et al.,
    2017). As for the pendulum swing phenomenon discussed above, economic and industrial
    development in the short term caused surface water contamination and environmental
    degradation in the long term. Ultimately, human actions led to contamination of
    drinking water, which compromised the health of residents. One promising approach
    to capture sociohydrology of unsafe drinking water and its uneven distribution
    is developing interdisciplinary case studies that account for both the hydrological
    and social dimensions of water-quality transformations. The aforementioned study
    by Rusca, Boakye-Ansah, et al. (2017), for instance, drew attention to the interdependencies
    between socio-political processes and microbiological and physiochemical contamination
    of drinking water and proposes a methodological approach to capture these (see
    also Boakye-Ansah et al., 2016). Concurrently, sociohydrology may further understandings
    of risk perception in relation with water contamination and how extreme events
    may influence it. For instance, polls following the Flint water crisis show approximately
    half of the American population distrusts their tap water (Baum et al., 2016).
    These perceptions may, in turn, affect the way in which people access and consume
    water. All together these lines of inquiry have the potential to contribute to
    advancing SDG 6, as well as SDG 3 on good health and well-being, especially ending
    waterborne diseases by 2030 (Target 3.3). Last, synergies and trade-offs involving
    water quality extend well beyond Goal 6. Alcamo (2019) points to some important
    and less explored trade-offs: the expansion of conventional agriculture may contribute
    to Goal 2 (Zero hunger) but is likely to increase water pollution downstream;
    on the other end, high-saline-polluted water is inadequate for irrigation. Wastewater
    treatment is an energy intensive activity and will negatively impact Goal 7 (affordable
    and clean energy, see also Yillia, 2016). Today, at least one third of the rivers
    in Africa, Latin America, and Asia is polluted by untreated wastewater (United
    Nations Environment Program, UNEP, 2016). Wastewater treatment is, therefore,
    likely to have a major impact on the conservation, restoration, and sustainable
    use of terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems (Target 15.1). Last, as good
    water quality is a prerequisite of subsistence, it plays an important role in
    targets such as slum upgrading (Target 11.1) and reduction of inequalities (SDG
    10) (Alcamo, 2019). 2.4.2 Water-Energy-Food Nexus Water plays a key role in several
    SDGs (as seen in Figure 2), and therefore, water management must account for these
    multiple interacting objectives, not just focusing on clean water and sanitation
    (UN Water, 2018). For example, water is at the heart of current research in the
    water-energy-food nexus across all spatial scales of analysis (Cudennec et al.,
    2018; D''Odorico et al., 2018; Lant et al., 2018; Liu, Yang, et al., 2017). A
    study by Yillia (2016) reveals the multiple trade-offs and interconnections within
    this nexus. He suggests that interdependencies between water and energy have mostly
    focused on how few elements interact, rather than taking a more holistic and comprehensive
    approach. The interactions, she argues, are multiple and take place at different
    scales. These range from the use of water (SDG 6) to extract and transport energy
    sources, produce and convert energy, irrigate crops for biofuel production, and
    water intensive renewable energy (SDG 8). Energy is needed for treatment, distribution,
    and transport of drinking water and desalination (SDG6), as well as for irrigation
    (SD2). Last, as mentioned above, wastewater treatment is an energy intensive activity
    that plays a key role in ensuring water quality (SDG 6) and ecosystem protection
    (SDG 15). Much research has been devoted to evaluating the vast water resources
    virtually embedded in internationally and regionally traded commodities, including
    food and energy (Allan, 2011; Hoekstra & Mekonnen, 2012; Konar et al., 2011; Marston
    et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2017). Future sociohydrology research may strive to
    represent these virtual flows of water in order to understand the full producer-consumer
    chain of economic goods that require water (Konar et al., 2016). This will enable
    consumers to identify the water resources infrastructure that is supporting their
    food and energy receipts, enabling better accounting across SDGs. Critically,
    resolving these flows will enable consumers to better assess the exposure of their
    supply chains to water stress and shocks. During the 2008 annual meeting of the
    World Economic Forum, participants called for a better understanding of the relationship
    between economic growth and (virtual) water flows (WEF Water Initiative, 2011).
    Causal inference research in economics has shown that international trade leads
    to increased economic growth (Frankel & Romer, 1999). Virtual water flows are
    essentially a rescaled metric of international commodity trade (typically provided
    in mass [tons] or value [$] units). It is therefore likely that virtual water
    trade also drives economic growth, though future research is to confirm this.
    Relatedly, recent causal inference work by Dang and Konar (2018) has shown that
    trade openness reduces the amount of water that the countries use in agriculture,
    with no impact to the industrial or total water use of nations. This research
    shows the average impact of trade on water use. Future research may explore the
    implications of trade for water use in specific settings and time domains. This
    work by Dang and Konar (2018) highlights the interconnected nature of food-energy-water
    systems and illustrates that policies in one system may have spillover effects
    to another (e.g., economic trade policy has unintended consequences for water
    use in agriculture). Similarly, recent research by Deryugina and Konar (2017)
    employed causal inference methods to understand the impact of crop insurance on
    water use. They find that crop insurance leads to more irrigation withdrawals
    in agriculture, mainly due to farmers deciding to grow more water-intensive crops.
    Thus, these studies highlight that policies that are supposedly unrelated to water
    (e.g., trade and crop insurance) can have unexpected consequences in terms of
    water consumptions. Similarly, the International Water Management Institute highlights
    how working to achieve the food SDG can have spillover effects for water (International
    Water Management Institute, 2018). This indicates that the SDGs are interrelated,
    and efforts to work toward the goal of one SDG may have unintended consequences
    for other SDGs. Future sociohydrology research should aim to better understand
    the complex interactions that exist in the food-energy-water nexus to enhance
    our ability to address all SDGs. 2.4.3 Transboundary Water Management Different
    SDGs give rise to different fundamental questions. Underlying questions concerning
    international basins is, as illustrated by Petersen-Perlman et al. (2017, p. 13),
    the idea that being part of a transboundary basin makes a user interconnected
    with the rest of its users. For example, specific measures to promote economic
    growth (SDG 8) in a given place, for example, building large water infrastructure
    for food or energy production, can jeopardize other objectives in other places,
    such as reducing inequalities (SDG 10) or protecting and restoring water-related
    ecosystems (SDG 15). In this perspective, cooperation in transboundary rivers
    (SDG6) can be also seen as one of the major environmental challenges of the century
    (Song & Whittington, 2004). This is particularly true in transboundary rivers
    that flow across political boundaries (De Stefano et al., 2017; Grey & Sadoff,
    2003). The riparian states usually value water differently, leading to differences
    in water management regime, priorities, and culture. Consequently, transboundary
    river systems are characterized by both conflict and cooperation (Petersen-Perlman
    & Wolf, 2015; Yoffe et al., 2003; Zeitoun & Mirumachi, 2008). Conflict and cooperation
    in transboundary rivers can be seen as socio-hydrological phenomena driven by
    the interplay of hydrological, technical, and social processes. They remain widely
    underresearched and not well understood. For example, it was found that no single
    indicator, be it climate, water scarcity, government type, or water demand, could
    explain the emergence of either conflict or cooperation (Yoffe et al., 2003).
    Hence, sociohydrology can contribute to a better understanding of cooperative
    and noncooperative responses by interpreting them as outcomes of long-term coevolution
    (Pande & Ertsen, 2014), or as the effect of single events, such as the construction
    of the large dam or the occurrence of a climatic shock (Gleick, 2014). Therefore,
    taking a socio-hydrological approach to transboundary water management can help
    to unravel the feedback mechanisms that explain these phenomena (Mianabadi et
    al., 2015) and, in turn, to meet water and environment-related SDGs. 3 Scientific
    Challenges in Integrating the Social and Hydrological Dimensions As sociohydrology
    strives to make headway toward improved understanding of the phenomena reviewed
    in sections 2 and 3 and broadens in scope to cope with a wider range of phenomena,
    including new phenomena that are likely to arise in the process of aiming to meet
    the SDGs, new methodological challenges arise. This section presents these challenges
    and outlines possible ways forward toward confronting these challenges. 3.1 Mechanisms
    and Phenomena Across Temporal and Spatial Scales One of the major challenges for
    sociohydrology is that the interplay of human and water systems involves both
    hydrological processes and social processes (and institutions) operating at multiple
    spatial and time scales (Figure 4). Capturing how these processes interact across
    time and space scales, for example, how short-term processes affect longer term
    processes, and vice versa can provide important insights on the possible short-
    and long-term impacts of implementing the SDGs and on spatial distribution of
    these impacts. Figure 4 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Temporal and spatial
    scales in (a) hydrological processes (Blöschl & Sivapalan, 1995) and (b) institutions
    (Gunderson & Holling, 2001). 3.1.1 Temporal Dynamics and Time Scale Interactions
    Many of the phenomena discussed in section 2, such as the safe development paradox
    and the pendulum swing, tend to operate over long (decadal or centennial) time
    scales, but they often involve short-term processes, such as the seasonal cycle
    of irrigation, or flood inundation and defense activities that happen within hours.
    Flood formation is coupled with event scale precipitation and seasonal soil moisture
    as well as with soil, vegetation, landscape, and climate evolution occurring over
    centuries to millennia (Gaál et al., 2012). Similarly, in human-water systems,
    natural resources will slowly degrade if overused by human activities, such as
    water extraction or land use changes that do not allow for recovery (Ward et al.,
    2018). For example, large-scale deforestation in Western Australia for agriculture
    caused shifts to the water balance, leading to slowly rising water tables and
    extensive land and stream salinization, which contributed to a decline in agriculture
    and reduction of human population (Elshafei et al., 2014, 2016). The infrastructure
    system, typically, follows a slow evolutionary path linked to innovation through
    the interplay between technology and society (Geels, 2005; Pande et al., 2014).
    Technology includes infrastructure development to exploit water resources (e.g.,
    irrigation) or improved water use efficiency in agriculture (Kandasamy et al.,
    2014), or river training and construction of levees to protect cities from flooding
    (Di Baldassarre, Kooy, et al., 2013). However, infrastructure develops in response
    to accumulated effects of human-water interactions that occur at short time scales,
    for example, frequent flooding in urban communities can lead to raising or strengthening
    levees, likewise frequent water shortages in agricultural communities can lead
    to expanding water storage via reservoirs. Depending on what time scales are considered,
    different feedbacks may become relevant (Blöschl & Sivapalan, 1995). If short
    time scales are considered, slow processes will not change much and so can be
    assumed as fixed boundary conditions, while this is no longer the case over a
    longer time frame. This notion was recognized as early as 1890 by economist Marshall
    (1890). He considered a market period (hours) where goods produced for sale on
    the market, for example, in a fish market prices are taken as given, but quickly
    adjust to clear markets; over longer periods industrial capacity is taken as given
    but outputs, employment, and inputs of raw materials fluctuate; at even longer
    periods the stock of capital goods, such as factories and machines, will fluctuate;
    when looking at even longer time frames, technology, population trends, habits,
    and customs are all likely to change. 3.1.2 Legacy Risks For long-term processes
    related to hydrological, technical, or social parts of the system, a long-term
    perspective becomes extremely relevant, particularly if it is difficult (or expensive)
    to reverse any decisions that are made. Some of the phenomena (Table 1) make it
    difficult for actors to reverse decisions when lock-in situations occur. Such
    lock-in situations may be economically, politically, or culturally driven. For
    example, due to the safe-development paradox, or levee effect, once people have
    moved into floodplains it may be politically and economically difficult to relocate
    them to safer ground. Due to the irrigation efficiency paradox or economic rebound
    effect, a lock-in situation occurred in India, where smallholders pumped groundwater
    at no cost as a result of subsidized energy. This measure is difficult to reverse
    as it enhances the stability of the elected provincial government (Shah et al.,
    2012). The supply-demand cycle may result in lock-ins due to high investment costs
    and may make societies dependent on expensive infrastructure, such as reservoirs
    for drought management (Di Baldassarre, Wanders, et al., 2018; Kuil et al., 2018,
    2019), and eventually may result into a negative spiral toward peak water limits
    (Gleick & Palaniappan, 2010). The importance of decisions over long time frames
    for these types of processes is reflected in the concept of legacy risk, which
    is the expected cost of decisions made today carried over a very long time frame.
    Traditionally, the concept of legacy risk originated in the domains of nuclear
    waste and mining as these are processes that may linger over very long time periods
    (Pepper et al., 2014; Russell, 2000). The concept, however, applies to a range
    of processes, including environmental management (Winiwarter et al., 2016). The
    idea is to put particular emphasis in today''s planning on those decisions that
    may have enormous adverse effects for generations to come and will be difficult
    to reverse. The choice is a difficult one as legacy risks the nation chooses not
    to bear cannot be separated from the opportunity costs (benefits given up elsewhere)
    it willingly incurs in reducing them. Both risks and costs are defined by inhabitants''
    values and preferences (and thus culture) and are not restricted to narrow, objective
    measures (Russell, 2000, p. 4). Over and above this, there is also the issue of
    equity in relation to intergenerational and intragenerational distribution of
    risks and costs of these developments, as well as equity between different sectors
    of society (Zwarteveen et al., 2017; Zwarteveen & Boelens, 2014). 3.1.3 Spatial
    Processes and Space-Scale Interactions Water-related issues have a spatial component,
    which shapes trade-offs, compromises, and negotiations between conflicting interests
    in different parts of the river basin (Loucks et al., 2005). In the water system,
    the spatial component arises because of spatial linkages of the water cycle. These
    linkages occur at all spatial scales, from the hillslope (through later surface
    and subsurface flow) right to the continental scale (through routing of water
    in river systems), and even globally (through atmospheric water transport) (Pringle,
    2003; Savio et al., 2015; Van der Ent et al., 2010; Western et al., 1998). These
    spatial hydrological connectivities are relevant in terms of water quantity, such
    as upstream water uses that reduce downstream discharge; upstream flood retention
    that reduces downstream floods; water quality, that is, groundwater contamination
    affecting water quality further down the aquifer; and ecologically, such as in
    wetlands or at the river system scale. These linkages also shape institutions,
    which interact at all spatial scales, from individuals to governments. Social
    stratification, power relationships, trust, cultural beliefs, and cognitive biases
    strongly influence the way in which different social groups can (or not) alter,
    perceive, and adapt to hydrological change. These heterogeneous elements also
    determine how water governance unfolds and, in turn, how water is managed at different
    scales (Pahl-Wostl et al., 2013; Wei et al., 2017). As suggested by Zwarteveen
    et al. (2017), water governance is inherently political and concerns decisions
    on where and to whom water flows to and the institutions, norms, and beliefs underlying
    these decision-making processes (see also Wei et al., 2017). Moreover, humans
    are diverse, interpretive creatures who frequently disagree about values, means,
    and ends (Castree et al., 2014: p.765; Massuel et al., 2018; Hulme, 2010). Most
    phenomena discussed in section 2 can have a spatial component. For example, the
    pendulum swing manifested itself as a spatial process in the Kissimmee River basin
    in Florida (Chen et al., 2016). Severe flooding in the rural part of the catchment
    in the 1950s led to river training, which, however, degraded the local wetlands.
    The community in the urban part of the catchment valued the environment more than
    flood mitigation (as the latter did not concern them directly) resulting in river
    being remeandered and the wetlands being restored. The safe-development paradox,
    or levee effect, very often has a spatial component when the construction of polders
    upstream of the floodplains under risk is considered. The irrigation efficiency
    paradox or rebound effect often has a spatial component in transboundary river
    management when water use increases due to regional water transfers (Dell''Angelo
    et al., 2018; Müller et al., 2016). Socio-hydrological entities are interconnected
    in today''s highly connected world. The space-time linkages are not only within
    each scale but also across scales and can lead to emergence of diverse phenomena
    such as large-scale droughts. Trade networks spread knowledge and can bring in
    sudden changes in land use policies such as rapid deforestation in the Amazon
    or even changes in how resources are governed. The understanding of dynamic patterns
    of interconnectedness through trade and the global hydrological cycle is therefore
    critical to the assessment of long-term water resource availability at global
    and local scales. This demands an extension of systems with endogenous human agency
    to space and to space-time. A natural extension is therefore to endogenize the
    boundary conditions themselves, for example, of trade or rainfall, just as sociohydrology
    has endogenized scenarios in the time domain, for example, of population growth,
    through bidirectional feedbacks. This requires us to understand additional processes
    that connect socio-hydrological entities in space, with the goal of explaining
    why aggregated, macroscopic behavior emerges from heterogeneous components. 3.2
    Evaluating the Implications of the SDGs: Integrating Quantitative and Qualitative
    Data One scientific challenge in sociohydrology is integrating qualitative reporting
    and case studies to provide in-depth, context specific, critical descriptions
    of human-water interactions at different scales (Massuel et al., 2018; Mostert,
    2018; Sexsmith & McMichael, 2015; Weststrate et al., 2018). This approach can
    contribute to widen the parameters used to examine the effectiveness of SDGs and
    ensure aspects related to human psychological, physical, and emotional well-being
    are taken into consideration. A second reason for integrating quantitative and
    qualitative data is to deepen the analysis of phenomena and processes that may
    enable or constrain the success of SDGs. This also entails critically examining
    the implementation of the water-related SDGs by questioning the underlying political,
    ideological, and economic logics. Several authors have warned that no long-term
    prosperity is possible without changes in the current economic system and that
    the new targets will not be effective if structural processes that perpetuate
    poverty are not addressed (Bello, 2013; Death & Gabay, 2015; Langford, 2016; Liverman,
    2018). This interpretation shared by the UN report of the high-level panel of
    eminent persons on the post-2015 development, co-chaired by Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono
    (at the time President of Indonesia), Ellen Johnson Sirleaf (at the time President
    of Liberia), and David Cameron (at the time Prime Minister of the United Kingdom),
    recognizes that it is unrealistic to think we can help another one billion people
    to lift themselves out of poverty […] without making structural changes in the
    world economy and calls for new models (United Nations, UN, 2013: p.5). Vandemoortele
    (2011, p. 13), one of the architects of the Millennium Development Goals, claimed
    that they have been misappropriated to reaffirm the conventional view of development.
    SDGs need to propose a new vision and a new understanding of sustainability, economic
    growth, and the environment, recognizing that the global economy services society,
    which lies within Earth''s life-support system (Griggs et al., 2013: 305; see
    also Bello, 2013). In other words, this requires a transformative change in the
    ways that economic development is conceived (sustainability) and financed (accountability
    and priority setting) and the benefits thereof are distributed (equity, Mawdsley,
    2018; Mawdsley, 2017; Sexsmith & McMichael, 2015). A productive engagement between
    sociohydrology and critical resource geography may produce relevant insights on
    the relation between financial flows, power, and hydrological flows in the implementation
    of the water-related SDGs at different temporal and spatial scales, as well as
    on how the benefits and costs of these developments are distributed between societal
    groups and across spaces. In doing so, sociohydrology has the potential to contribute
    more effectively also to goals focusing on poverty (SDG 1) and equity (SDG 10).
    These examinations, we argue, require both integrating qualitative approaches
    alongside quantitative analyses and within modeling exercises to better understand
    the current socio-political, economic, and cultural contexts in different locations
    and how these contribute to co-shape SDG outcomes. Given its theoretical paradigm,
    sociohydrology is well positioned to play a catalytic role in integrating qualitative
    and quantitative data, yet this endeavor entails major scientific challenges.
    A first challenge in doing this is offered by different epistemologies, research
    strategies, and axiologies of qualitative and quantitative approaches (Mostert,
    2018; Romagny & Cudennec, 2006; Wesselink et al., 2016). To preserve the richness
    and epistemological perspective of qualitative approaches, Mostert (2018) suggests
    developing case studies on the multiple ways in which humans alter hydrology in
    specific contexts and carefully selecting cases for comparative analysis and,
    possibly, for generalization of some patterns (see, for instance, Robinson, 2016).
    In their study on drinking water quality in the city of Lilongwe, Rusca, Boakye-Ansah,
    et al., 2017; Rusca, Alda-Vidal, et al., 2017) propose a case study design that
    accounts for both the complexity of the human dimension(s) and material and quantitative
    variables of the hydrological system. This approach allows retaining central themes
    of scholars in critical water studies and political ecology such as the role of
    ideology, power, class, gender, culture, and everyday practices in controlling
    and directing water flows in rural, urban, and regional landscapes and the uneven
    distribution of costs and benefits thereof (Alda-Vidal et al., 2018; Ekers & Loftus,
    2008; Swyngedouw, 1997; Tiwale et al., 2018; Truelove, 2011; Truelove, 2016),
    and relating these to changes to the hydrological system. A second specific challenge
    with integrating quantitative and qualitative data concerns how to capture aspects
    that are (i) heterogeneous (i.e., diverse for different social groups), (ii) typically
    described in a qualitative way, and (iii) rarely collected in a systematic fashion.
    For instance, by looking at the five variables of the loop diagram presented earlier
    in Figure 3a, one can see that while some of these variables can be easily quantified
    and are often available as systematic time series (e.g., flooding, expressed as
    high water levels above a datum; Di Baldassarre, Viglione, et al., 2013,Di Baldassarre,
    Kooy, et al., 2013; Di Baldassarre et al., 2015), others are more qualitative
    and typically not systematically available over time (e.g., flood memory, expressed
    as the level of risk awareness in a community; Di Baldassarre, Viglione, et al.,
    2013; Di Baldassarre, Kooy, et al., 2013; Di Baldassarre et al., 2015). Moreover,
    flood memory is heterogeneously accumulated in different individuals or social
    groups, and these various individuals or social groups have different capacities
    to influence the decision-making process and to feed back on the hydrological
    system. In socio-hydrological modeling, the most common approach has been to turn
    qualitative information into quantitative using some proxies, such as flood insurance
    coverage as an analog of the level of flood risk awareness (Di Baldassarre et
    al., 2017), or using social media coverage, newspaper articles, or Google trends
    (Roby et al., 2018; Wei et al., 2017). Yet these short-cut methods raise numerous
    concerns, such as limited representativeness and their unavoidable inability to
    describe the heterogeneity of human society. Thus, there remains a need to better
    integrate social and hydrological sciences as well as qualitative and quantitative
    information for the study of human-water interactions. 3.3 Exploiting Socio-Hydrologic
    Understanding to Enable Improved IWRM Practice The advances expected to be made
    in socio-hydrologic understanding raises the question as to how these can help
    advance water management practice, notably IWRM, in the context of the UN SDGs.
    Sociohydrology can play a role in working toward societal water goals in two major
    ways. First, sociohydrology aims to provide scientific insights that can be used
    to inform IWRM. This is the detection and understanding of phenomena that exist
    in water resources management (see above; sections 2 and 3). Both sociohydrology
    and IWRM aim to help achieve SDGs (Figure 5), particularly the water-related targets
    highlighted in Figure 2. Second, sociohydrology is well-suited to scientifically
    evaluate the consequences of IWRM implementation. For example, sociohydrology
    can integrate understanding from the policy evaluation community (e.g., causal
    inference) to assess whether or not water management or policy had the intended
    outcome. In this way, sociohydrology and IWRM should strive to inform one another
    and learn from each other in a two way street of information exchange (see Figure
    5). Figure 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Conceptual framing of the relationships
    between sociohydrology, Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM), and the
    Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Both sociohydrology and IWRM strive to achieve
    the SDGs. It is imperative that sociohydrology and IWRM communicate with each
    other and learn from one another to this end. As discussed in section 2, several
    emergent phenomena have been established through sociohydrology research. These
    phenomena have clear implications for IWRM. In Table 1, we map how a better understanding
    of socio-hydrological phenomena can provide useful insights to improve IWRM and
    help lead to desirable societal goals set forth by SDGs. For instance, through
    a better understanding of the rebound effect, we show that implementing drip irrigation
    alone will not lead to reduced water use, but, rather, may actually lead to increased
    water use. This means that IWRM should consider implementing counteracting measures,
    such as water basin use caps, along with irrigation efficiency technologies. It
    is essential to evaluate whether an IWRM intervention actually leads to the desired
    outcome. For example, does installing improved sanitation in a local community
    actually lead to reductions in waterborne diseases and diarrheal outbreaks? Sociohydrology
    can lead the way in evaluating whether or not IWRM interventions have the desirable
    impacts. Sociohydrology can do this through the adoption of novel techniques from
    the policy evaluation and econometrics fields. In fact, this increased interaction
    between sociohydrology and economics was recently called for by Müller and Levy
    (2019). The tools of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and causal inference
    using natural experiments in empirical information can be exploited to properly
    determine whether or not IWRM interventions are leading toward the desired societal
    goals or the SDGs. When possible, RCTs should be used to determine the outcome
    of an intervention. For example, to address the question about improved sanitation
    implementation discussed above, it would be best to install improved sanitation
    facilities randomly in some locations and not install them in others and then
    assess the outcomes (Null et al., 2018). The key is that the treatment (e.g.,
    improved sanitation) must be randomly assigned in order to determine its causal
    impact on the societal outcome of interest (e.g., diarrhea). RCTs are the gold
    standard for assessing the impact of a treatment. For this reason, whenever possible,
    randomization of IWRM management techniques or interventions would be the preferred
    course of action. Unfortunately, it will often not be feasible to perform an RCT
    to evaluate IWRM action. This is because they are expensive, time consuming, and
    may sometimes be unethical. For this reason, exploiting naturally occurring data
    (i.e., nonexperimental) that has some attributes that can help us to distinguish
    that causal impact of the treatment on the outcome of interest is critical. This
    is the aim of causal inference in econometrics. Causal inference has recently
    been applied to understand how human interventions impact water resources, such
    as for crop insurance (Deryugina & Konar, 2017) and international trade (Dang
    & Konar, 2018). Going forward, it will be of continued importance for sociohydrology
    to employ causal inference tools to assess the performance of IWRM in helping
    us meet the SDGs. 3.4 Addressing a Societal Grand Challenge: Managing Trade-Offs
    Between SDGs and Overcoming Legacy Risks The water crises that humanity faces
    are increasingly multifaceted, complex, and intertwined. This is clearly reflected
    in the fact that many of the United Nations SDGs may affect or are affected by
    the quantity and quality of water resources (Figure 2). Linear and short-term
    approaches to fix one problem in isolation often trigger new problems. Failure
    to anticipate and comprehensively address emergent water-related risks of floods,
    droughts, and water-quality degradation holistically and inclusively can cause
    economic decline and can lead some communities into a poverty trap, an emergent
    phenomenon highlighted by Borgeomo et al. (2018) based on work in Bangladesh.
    This shows how, at a broader level, water management is intimately tied to SDG
    1, which aims at eradicating poverty. Managing water-related issues comprehensively
    and holistically thus requires nontrivial decisions about what to prioritize (e.g.,
    drinking vs sanitation vs food), who pays to address these issues and how much,
    how the benefits and the costs of these measures are distributed (rich vs poor,
    upstream vs downstream, and urban vs rural), and how to balance benefits and costs
    (economic vs environmental vs social). It is essential to fully integrate water
    resources management across the entire socio-hydrological cycle; different water
    users including engineering, economic, social, ecological, and legal aspects;
    and spatial scales, including, for example, upstream/downstream perspectives.
    While technical measures can work in the short term, the absent (or limited) involvement
    of society-at-large (i.e., the beneficiaries) often leads to adverse consequences
    such as resistance to (or nonacceptance of) introduced policies. Recognizing the
    nonlinear nature of human-water systems and pursuing broader and long-term perspectives
    are key steps to craft more robust decisions (Haasnoot et al., 2013) and tackle
    the current and future water challenges in a more sustainable way. Figure 6 illustrates,
    in a simple and schematized way, the variation over time of the performance in
    addressing societal challenges. It can be seen, for example, as a composite value
    of various indicators for the achievement of the SDGs. For the sake of simplicity,
    we consider only two of them (i) the real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita
    (SDG8, Indicator for target 1.1); and the extent of wetlands over time (SDG 6,
    Indicator for target 6.6). In Figure 6a, we see that Path 1 gets closer than Path
    2 to the composite target by 2030, which is the year in which SDGs are expected
    to be achieved. A short-term approach would therefore favor policies associated
    with Path 1. However, Path 2 is more sustainable, and it is more effective than
    Path 1 in the longer term (Figure 6a). Figures 6b and 6c decompose these two paths
    and exemplify how short-term perspectives can become unsustainable in the long
    term. Path 1 relies on fast economic growth but with unsustainable environmental
    costs, that is, degradation of wetlands and aquifer depletion. In the long term,
    not only does this narrow approach prevent further growth but it also leads to
    increasing poverty (Figure 6b). Path 2, instead, is promoting economic growth
    but without compromising the environment, depleting water resources, and compromising
    future generations. In the long term, this broader approach results more sustainable
    (Figure 6c). Figure 6 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Addressing a societal grand
    challenge, for example, performance in achieving the SDGs. Conceptual drawings
    illustrating: (a) short-term (Path 1) versus long-term (Path 2) perspective. Path
    1 gets closer than Path 2 to the composite target by 2030, which is the year in
    which SDGs are expected to be achieved, but Path 2 is more sustainable and more
    effective than Path 1 in the longer term. (b and c) Decompositions of Path 1 (short-term)
    and Path 2 (long-term) exemplifying how short-term perspectives can become unsustainable
    in the long term. Path 1 relies on fast economic growth but with unsustainable
    environmental costs, that is, degradation of wetlands and aquifer depletion. (d
    and e) Possibility space and decision trees for Path 1 (constrained) Path 2 (unconstrained).
    These two panels show that water policies and management decisions are typically
    updated over time (dots in the diagrams). The possibility space of Path 1 becomes
    constrained (Figure 6d) once that water resources are depleted, as environmental
    degradation and economic decline are essentially irreversible. The possibility
    space of Path 2 remains unconstrained (Figure 6e), that is, policy and decision
    makers can keep influencing the trajectory over time and therefore adjust and
    adapt to, for example, climatic and socio-economic changes. Indeed, all of the
    socio-hydrological phenomena discussed previously in section 2 can be seen as
    a legacy: the result of a coevolution between hydrological, technical, and social
    systems, which influence or constrain today''s decision. As the past was a legacy
    to the present, the present is a legacy for the future. This implies that water
    policies and management decisions have a legacy risk. Short-term fixes based on
    linear thinking can have negative repercussion in the long term, which might be
    difficult, if not impossible, to reverse, that is, a lock-in condition. To cope
    with legacy risks, we need to look at future trajectories and exclude decisions
    that cannot be reversed, that is, not to constraining the future possibility space.
    Thus, understanding how the interactions and feedbacks between social, technical,
    and hydrological processes generate legacy in water management is crucial to reducing
    legacy risk. Figures 6d and 6e illustrate these concepts. Path 1 and Path 2 are
    represented using decision trees in the possibility space. This illustration reflects
    the fact that water policies and management decisions are typically updated over
    time. In the example of Figure 6d, the possibility space of Path 1 becomes constrained
    once that water resources are depleted, as environmental degradation and economic
    decline are essentially irreversible. Instead, the possibility space of Path 2
    remains nonconstrained. Policy and decision makers can keep influencing the trajectory
    over time and therefore adjust and adapt to, for example, climatic and socio-economic
    changes. The concept of legacy risk ties in well with the precautionary principle.
    In its strongest formulation, the precautionary principle calls for absolute proof
    of safety before allowing new technologies to be adopted (Foster et al., 2000).
    It is an important component of much of the environmental legislation in the western
    world. The reasoning is similar to that of legacy risk, that is, to err on the
    side of least consequences. In fact, the concept of legacy risk can be interpreted
    as a dynamic version of the precautionary principle. When in doubt, the decisions
    we make must try to avoid those development paths that potentially have irreversible
    effects resulting from the types of phenomena discussed in this paper. The generalized
    understanding of phenomena that may lead to lock-in situations, be they economically,
    politically, culturally, or environmentally driven, will provide guidance as to
    what extent the principle should be weighed against quantitative evidence, cost-benefit
    analyses, and discretionary judgment. Work on time-space scale interactions, the
    opportunities of using both qualitative and quantitative information, and setting
    up a more integrated interdisciplinary collaboration process will help in making
    progress in understanding generalizable phenomena. The levee effect, supply-demand
    cycles, and the irrigation efficiency paradox are all reflections of coupled human-water
    processes that may or may not constrain future decision making. 4 Conclusions
    In this paper, we examined the role of sociohydrology in addressing the societal
    grand challenges posed by the SDGs. We argued that sociohydrology is an appropriate
    analytical framework to conceptualize and evaluate the water implications of the
    SDGs. First, sociohydrology can act as an interface between the SDGs and IWRM
    principles. In conceptualizing water challenges, sociohydrology considers socio-cultural
    and socio-political dimensions as well as short-term and long-term impacts of
    water governance processes. As such, it provides both actionable and generalizable
    insights on short- and long-term impacts of the strategies adopted to meet the
    SDGs targets. Second, sociohydrology has focused on the explanation of a wide
    range of phenomena that may enable or constrain the success of water-related SDGs.
    There is considerable scope for applying these insights to strategies developed
    by different countries to meet the SDGs. Last, in the coming years sociohydrology
    will critically examine the implementation of the water-related SDGs to monitor
    their short- and long-term sustainability. Concurrently, the paper identified
    a series of research directions to further sociohydrology and enhance its contribution
    to the SDGs. We propose a research agenda that widens the range of phenomena—including
    water pollution and health-related challenges, the water-food-energy nexus, and
    transboundary water governance—and explores and tests innovative methodologies
    to trace water-society interactions at different temporal and spatial scales.
    To achieve the United Nations SDGs, there is a need to (i) capture the complex,
    multifaceted nature of human-water systems and (ii) explore long-term dynamics
    associated with alternative policies. These two aspects have been the very essence
    of socio-hydrological research over the past 6 years. However, it is no longer
    adequate to investigate, after the fact, the causes of water crises in different
    contexts and frame them theoretically as the unintended consequences of water
    resources management or governance. Increasingly, sociohydrology must aspire to
    assist communities involved in IWRM to frame water-related issues in broader terms
    and develop models capable of generating likely alternative futures under various
    policy options (Bai et al., 2016). This will empower communities, and in particular
    the IWRM community, to make more informed decisions for sustainable development
    and management of water resources. This requires a broadening of the theoretical
    foundations and methodological diversity of sociohydrology, going beyond individual
    phenomena, and toward mapping out the safe operating space for humanity to manage
    their water resources sustainably. By being open to face up to these scientific
    challenges, sociohydrology is well placed to help communities to meet the SDGs,
    the societal grand challenge of our time. Acknowledgments This work was developed

  explanation: The paper presents a systematic and automated method for monitoring
    large chili fertigation areas to enhance farm management and plant growth, especially
    in areas prone to power outages. It consists of 1) sensors for irrigation and
    power outage detection, 2) a mobile app for pesticide scheduling and polybag cleaning
    management, and 3) a web app for planting schedule management. Test results in
    a 1000-pot chili fertigation site in Malaysia showed 40% manpower reduction compared
    to a manually operated system along with improved control over plant growth and
    documentation of pesticide schedules and polybag cleaning, all of which could
    be scaled up for larger farming areas in rural sites.

    method applied on the same scope, the results and performance

    will be more accurate if the system is tested over various kinds

    of plants with larger pots (~2000 pots and more) and the data

    are observed over longer period of time i.e. three to six months.'

    \ \ntechnique, sufficient amount of water and nutrients are crucial \nfor a plant's\
    \ growth and development. An electronic timer is \nusually used to control the\
    \ plant watering automatically and the \nscheduling is set according to different\
    \ levels of plant growth. \nThe timer has to be adjusted frequently since the\
    \ required \namount of water is different according to the growth stages. In \n\
    power outage-prone regions, the problem with scheduled \nirrigation using timer\
    \ becomes worsen since the watering \nschedule is disrupted by occasional black-outs,\
    \ leading to an \ninsufficient supply of water and nutrients, which leads to poor\
    \ \ncrop yields. Typical solution for such problems is by hiring field \nworks\
    \ to monitor the functionality of the automated system, \nplant health, and to\
    \ re-adjust the timer once a power outage \noccurs. However, this solution is\
    \ ineffective, time-consuming, and \nacquires high overhead costs. This paper\
    \ proposes a systematic \nirrigation method using the internet-of-things (IoT)\
    \ framework \nin order to improve the monitoring of plant growth and \nconsequently\
    \ improves the efficiency of the workflow. This \nsystematic fertigation monitoring\
    \ system consists of power \noutage alerts, and on-line notifications of plant\
    \ irrigation, \npesticide delivery, and polybag cleaning schedule. As a result,\
    \ by \nusing the proposed system, higher efficiency in farming \nmanagement is\
    \ achieved, with a 40% reduction in manpower, as \ncompared to a typical fertigation-based\
    \ farming system. This \nsystem demonstrates greater control over irrigation scheduling,\
    \ \nplant growth, recording of pesticide scheduling automatically, \nand polybag\

    \ \nI. \nINTRODUCTION \nThe advancement in technology has influenced modern \n\
    farming methods signiﬁcantly and agricultural environment \nparticularly. The\
    \ agricultural landscape has shifted from \nconventional farming to digitized\
    \ farming with the merging of \ninterrelated computing devices, sensors, and cloud\
    \ edge [1-5]. \nIn addition, the combination of engineering and computing \ntechnology,\
    \ equipped with sensors for agricultural activities, \nhas enabled smart farming\
    \ [6]. As the demand for food sources \nincreases around the world, irrigation\
    \ has grown even more \nnecessary to prevent famine and nutritional deaths [7].\
    \ \nAdvanced irrigation techniques are essential in order to \nachieve eﬃcient\
    \ irrigation management, and an optimal \nagriculture management system will ensure\
    \ productivity, and \nenvironmental and economic viability [7-10]. Most techniques,\
    \ \nsuch as regulated deﬁcit irrigation [11], automated drip \nfertigation [10,12-13]\
    \ and precision irrigation systems oﬀer the \nopportunity to conserve irrigation\
    \ water, improve fruit quality, \nincreasing crop yield and decreasing costs while\
    \ contributing \nto environmental sustainability [14-15]. \nThe motivation of\
    \ this study is to improve the management \nsystem of the irrigation scheduling\
    \ by providing farmers with \nreal-time feedback during irrigation so that they\
    \ are notiﬁed of \nany abrupt loss of electricity, and can act based on the \n\
    information provided by the system. This enables farmers to \ndecide which nutrients\
    \ should be received by the plant by \ncontrolling the timing of the irrigation.\
    \ The system is easy to \ndeploy in existing drip fertigation systems, with a\
    \ plug-and-\nplay module insertion. The application also aims to provide \nfarmers\
    \ and farm workers with a user-friendly tool that \nfacilitates the management\
    \ of pesticides and drip maintenance. \nInstead of manually entering records,\
    \ farmers can track \npesticide schedules through the system, which makes the\
    \ \nprocess more manageable. It is expected that the proposed \nsystem could improve\
    \ the crops yield as well as equipped the \nfarmers with an improved and smart\
    \ farming management \nsystem. The results demonstrated that the developed system\
    \ \ncould eﬀectively facilitate fertigation management for outage-\nprone areas\
    \ and substantially decrease the need for on-site \nmonitoring. \nThe rest of\
    \ the manuscript is organized as follows. \nSection 2 describes related work in\
    \ the area of advanced \nirrigation. Section 3 describes the user-friendly platform\
    \ of the \nproposed system. This section also describes the real-time \nirrigation\
    \ feedback, which records current and past irrigation \ndurations, as well as\
    \ the alert system, which notifies farmers of \nany absence of electricity. Section\
    \ 4 describes the \nimplementation of the system and discusses the results, and\
    \ \nSection 5 presents the concluding remarks and future research. \n*Corresponding\

    \ OVERVIEW OF DRIP FERTIGATION METHODS \nDrip fertigation system is gradually\
    \ gaining acceptance, \nand is becoming more attractive to many farmers since\
    \ it \nsupplies nutrients and water to the plant root zone more \neﬀectively than\
    \ conventional planting [16]. To date, [17] have \nattempted to design an automatic\
    \ irrigation system, but its \nimplementation on actual farming sites has not\
    \ been fully \ninvestigated. Another study to improve the drip irrigation \ntechnique\
    \ was recently designed by [18]. Using this technique, \nfarmers do not have to\
    \ manually mix the fertilizer, which \nrequires them to read the EC and pH of\
    \ the mixture. Slow \nadoption of drip fertigation technology might be caused\
    \ by low \nexposure, lack of expert techno-logical support, and the high \ncost\
    \ of implementation, which includes hardware with \ncomputing, storage, and communication\
    \ capabilities. \nThe automated drip fertigation system is more appealing to \n\
    farmers worldwide, and has been gradually replacing \nconventional methods of\
    \ farming. This is mainly due to the \nimprovement in the quality of crops and\
    \ agricultural products, \nas adequate nutrition is delivered directly to the\
    \ plant root zone \n[19]. Such system saves signiﬁcant amount of time when \n\
    scheduled irrigation is performed remotely by turning pumps \nand valves on and\
    \ oﬀ [20]. In a study done by [21], \nproductivity for crops such as ginger shows\
    \ increment in net \nincome due to an increase in the yields of ginger. The crop\
    \ \nproductivity is almost doubled per hectare with an automatic \ndrip fertigation\
    \ system, compared to more conventional \nmethods. Although the drip fertigation\
    \ system requires a large \namount of initial capital, the cost will be compensated\
    \ by high \ncrop productivity. In [22], the authors introduce a real-time \nirrigation\
    \ system, named REUTIVAR, which calculates \nirrigation timing and fertilizer\
    \ amount required in real-time \nusing reclaimed water to watering olive tree.\
    \ This technique \nwill determine the timing of irrigation and fertigation events\
    \ \nand can optimize fertilizer injection, the stabilization time and \ncleaning\
    \ phase. \nThe development of useful new models based on the \ndecision support\
    \ system (DSS) has improved the automatic \nirrigation system [23-24]. An optimized\
    \ DDS with a modified \nfertigation systems (DSS-FS) is designed primarily for\
    \ drip and \nsprinkler irrigation, based on an environmental sustainability \n\
    approach [25]. Meanwhile, [20] developed a DSS system to \nprovide insight into\
    \ the irrigation time required for a given crop \nand how irrigation schedules\
    \ would change with soil types. All \nof these DSSs and models are very helpful\
    \ in optimizing the \nuse of water and fertilizer, and managing the centralized\
    \ \nfertigation system in a water distribution network. However, \nthe eﬀects\
    \ of occasional power outages on a scheduled drip \nfertigation system have not\
    \ been investigated. Occasional \npower failures disrupt the time required for\
    \ irrigation, \nunfortunately lead to an insuﬃcient supply of water, and will\
    \ \naffect crop growth. \nIn order to improve network performance to achieve more\
    \ \nreliable smart farming system, an adaptive technique was \nintroduced to maintain\
    \ reliable network connection to transmit \nsensor data to base station by adaptively\
    \ change the \ncommunication protocol between IEEE 802.11ac and \nLoRaWAN [26].\
    \ This technique is particularly useful to \nmanage large farming sites at different\
    \ location. On the other \nhand, \nAgri-Info, \na \ncloud \nbased \nautonomic\
    \ \nresource \nmanagement technique for agriculture service was introduced \n\
    in order to maintain required level of QoS. This method makes \nuse of Fuzzy logic\
    \ for making decisions based on defined rules \nto diagnose status as well as\
    \ schedule the resources \nautomatically [27]. \nIn Malaysia, farmers have started\
    \ to use the automatic drip \nfertigation system. However, due to poor technical\
    \ knowledge \nand the initial development cost of the system, the farmers \nprefer\
    \ not to use the DSS, and decide to manage their planting \nbased on their experience\
    \ instead. This is also the reason \nfarmers opt to hire workers to man-age scheduled\
    \ irrigation \nthrough on-site monitoring during power failure, which is very\
    \ \ntedious and time-consuming, and in doing so, results in high \nman-power utilization.\
    \ \nThe lack of technological advancement in drip fertigation \nhas left farmers\
    \ with no option but to use the commercial \nirrigation controllers available\
    \ at the market, which are pre-\nprogrammed to supply water at predeﬁned intervals.\
    \ Typical \ndrip fertigation system uses a timer and a valve to turn on the \n\
    water pump for irrigation. Fig. 1 shows a typical fertigation \nsystem that consists\
    \ of a water tank, a timer, a water ﬁlter, a \nwater pump, garden accessories,\
    \ and a piping system to \nchannel water to individual pots [28-29]. These pots\
    \ are \narranged horizontally on the ground or vertically with \nsupporting poles.\
    \ The water supply is pre-program and follows \na preset schedule. The amount\
    \ of water and nutrients required \nby each plant is diﬀerent each week, and normally\
    \ depends on \nthe stage of growth. Table I shows the required amount of \nwater\
    \ and nutrients required during the ﬁrst three weeks of \ngrowth [30]. This table\
    \ indicates that 600 ml is the total amount \nof water required per day for vegetables\
    \ such as spinach and \neggplants [31]. \n \nFig. 1. The Fertigation System. \n\

    \ fertigation farms still use the \nold and conventional method of observing the\
    \ plantation site to \ncheck the growth of the plants. Field workers are required\
    \ to \nmonitor faults in the irrigation system and to perform regular \nchecks\
    \ on the plants’ leaves and roots for possible plant disease \ninfection. The\
    \ only way to deter-mine poor plant growth is to \nexamine the condition of the\
    \ leaves and roots. Yellowish or \nwilting leaves are signs of poor growth. This\
    \ farming workﬂow \nresults in ineﬃcient monitoring, especially when the plantation\
    \ \nsite holds thou-sands of pots. Fig. 2 shows the process in a \nfertigation\
    \ system implemented for a local chili variety called \nCentil. \nCentil (Capsicum\
    \ Frustecens) is a type of red chili currently \ngrown in Johor, Malaysia on a\
    \ farming area with 1,000 pots \n[32]. Workers observe the irrigation process\
    \ for 20 minutes in \nthe morning and 20 minutes in the afternoon, and spend an\
    \ \nadditional 40 minutes every evening inspecting plants for \ngeneral health\
    \ and wilting leaves. They spend another 20 \nminutes in the evening inspecting\
    \ for pests and diseases and \nadministering pesticides. They perform maintenance\
    \ and \npolybag cleaning once a week for 30 minutes. These processes \nare repeated\
    \ until harvesting day. The detailed activities of the \nfarming process are presented\
    \ in Table II. \nIn areas where occasional power outages occur, the \nirrigation\
    \ schedule, which is based on the needs of each plant, \nis often disturbed. Instead\
    \ of turning to technological solutions, \nfarmers prefer to hire more workers\
    \ to look for faults in the \nirrigation system. With the current practice of\
    \ having workers \nobserve on-site, adding more workers to monitor faults results\
    \ \nin ineﬃcient irrigation management and high costs in labor, \nwhich in turn\
    \ fails to oﬀset the initial investment. Such a \nfertigation strategy defeats\
    \ the purpose of an automatic \nirrigation and water management system, and could\
    \ worsen \ndepending on the solution taken by the farmers. \nPrevious work in\
    \ the irrigation ﬁeld focused on calculating \nirrigation requirements, where\
    \ crop details fetched from the \nuser were taken as input to estimate water requirements\
    \ with \nthe help of sensors. However, with scheduled irrigation, water \nand\
    \ nutrient requirements cannot be fulﬁlled when the process \nis disturbed by\
    \ an electrical power outage. Detailed \ninformation on the nutrients supplied\
    \ is lost and irretrievable. \nThe system shuts down, and the sensors do not capture\
    \ \ninformation during the absence of electricity. This condition \nwill go unnoticed\
    \ without any notiﬁcation to the farmers, and \nwill last until power returns,\
    \ which may take hours or even \ndays. The problem becomes more serious during\
    \ dry seasons \nand in remote farming areas, where farmers are not aware of \n\
    such situations. \n \nFig. 2. Manual Process of Monitoring Plant Growth. \nTABLE\

    \ because it \nprovides timely information on the actual status of farming \n\
    sites, such as the volume of water and fertilizer received, which \nis an important\

    \ SOLUTION \nIn this section, we describe the complete system of the \nproposed\
    \ automated monitoring system for watering and power \noutage alerts, with pesticide\
    \ and polybag cleaning notiﬁcations. \nThe proposed monitoring system comprises\
    \ of three main \ncomponents: (i) the overall system architecture; (ii) the sensor\
    \ \nsystems; and (iii) the mobile and web applications monitoring \ninterfaces,\
    \ as shown in Fig. 3. \nIn Fig. 3, a system administrator is in charge of the\
    \ farming \nsystem. This figure also shows that the farmers will use the \nmobile\
    \ application to monitor the system, receiving alerts and \nnotiﬁcations, and\
    \ interact with the system for pesticide \nscheduling and polybags maintenance.\
    \ The watering and power \noutage sensors are designed to detect whether the plants\
    \ have \nbeen watered, and to alert farmers through mobile notiﬁcations \nwhen\
    \ a power failure occurs. The notiﬁcations and alerts are \nsent through Global\
    \ System for Mobile Communications \n(GSM) to the internet service provider [33],\
    \ then to a cloud \nserver for data storage and processing. \nA. System Architecture\
    \ \nOur proposed monitoring system, as shown in Fig. 4, \nconsists of integration\
    \ of sensors with the existing fertigation \nsystem. The water sensor will be\
    \ installed in the main \ndistribution pipe, and on the other hand, the power\
    \ outage \nsensor will be installed on the power supply line. The proposed \n\
    system was developed by taking into account the important \nlayers of the IoT\
    \ architecture [34]. We introduced another layer \nfor troubleshooting and debugging\
    \ the sensors. This includes \nﬁxing the devices’ programming errors. In the second\
    \ layer, we \nhave our proposed watering and power outage detection \nsensors,\
    \ which are connected to an Arduino-based processor \nfor data processing. For\
    \ data transmission to the cloud server, \nthe devices connect wirelessly via\
    \ a GSM module, which is on \nthe third layer. The cloud server is on the fourth\
    \ layer, where \nall data is sent using the “post” application programming \n\
    interface (API) via a GSM module to the backend cloud \nprocessor. The cloud services\
    \ will cover all “post” and “get” \nAPIs from the GSM module and mobile applications.\
    \ Lastly, \nwe have a mobile application for monitoring and interaction, \nand\
    \ a web server for managing the system, as shown in Fig. 5. \nThe interaction\
    \ between the hardware, backend processor, \nand mobile applications is shown\
    \ in Fig. 6. Arduino will send \nthe “post” API to the backend processor on the\
    \ cloud via a \nGSM module. When the backend processor receives the API, it \n\
    will log it and update the record in the database. If a \nnotiﬁcation is required,\
    \ backend processor will trigger the \nFirebase server, which will then push the\
    \ notiﬁcation to our \nmobile application so that farmers will receive the notiﬁcation\
    \ \non their smartphones. For information updates, the mobile \napplication will\
    \ send the “post” and “get” APIs to request that \nthe data be updated on the\
    \ app. The cloud server acts as an \nintermediary between the sensors and the\
    \ mobile application. \n \nFig. 3. Components of the Fertigation System. \n \n\

    \ of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, \nVol. 12, No. 7, 2021 \nB. Sensor\
    \ System \nThe power outage sensor is powered by a 240 VAC main \npower source\
    \ that in turn is converted to a direct current (DC), \nwhich provides nine VDC\
    \ to the system by using an adaptor, as \nshown in Fig. 7. This is the main power\
    \ source for the \nfertigation system. The auxiliary power comes from the solar\
    \ \npanel, which charges a 3.7V 18650 Li-ion battery. The voltage \nfrom the battery\
    \ is then boosted to 9V and fed to a power \nselector circuit prior to Arduino.\
    \ The power selector takes the \npower in such a way that the power always comes\
    \ from the \nmain power source, except during a power outage, when it \ntakes\
    \ the power from the charged battery. \nThis power switch is instantaneous, similar\
    \ to an \nuninterrupted power supply (UPS), so that Arduino does not \nre-boot.\
    \ In the event of a power outage, the system will \nautomatically switch to the\
    \ solar-powered battery. While the \nsystem is using the battery, the transition\
    \ causes the system to \nsend a “power down” API token through a GSM module to\
    \ the \nbackend processing cloud server. When the server receives the \n“power\
    \ outage” API token, a power outage notiﬁcation is sent \nto a Firebase server,\
    \ which will then push it to the mobile \napplication. The dashboard will display\
    \ the power outage \nstatus, which will read “blackout has occurred” in red. This\
    \ \nfunction notiﬁes growers immediately when the system is no \nlonger using\
    \ the main power source. Thus, action can be taken \nto troubleshoot and to ﬁx\
    \ the problem. When the power outage \nsensor detects that the main source is\
    \ functioning again, it will \nsend the “power up” API to the server. Fig. 8 shows\
    \ the ﬂow of \nthe power outage sensor. The ﬂowchart shows that the “power \n\
    down” API and the “power up” API are sent to the server only \nwhen there is a\
    \ change in state. \n \nFig. 7. The Watering and Power Outage Sensors for Fertigation\
    \ System \n(Type A Module). \n \nFig. 8. Flow Chart for Power Outage Detection.\
    \ \nIn the fertigation system, the watering schedule uses a timer \nto activate\
    \ a water pump. The water pump releases water to the \nmain pipe for a period\
    \ of time determined by the volume of \nwater needed for each plant. Therefore,\
    \ it is crucial to know \nthat the plant has been watered according to the schedule\
    \ set by \nthe farmers. In our proposed system, the water detection sensor \n\
    is installed in the main pipe, where it will detect the presence \nof water. Water\
    \ detection only happens if there is a change in \nthe sensor as follows: \n1)\
    \ State 0 to 1 (No water is detected to Water is detected), \nAPI “watering start”\
    \ is called. \n2) State 1 to 0 (Water detected to No water) API “watering \nstop”\
    \ is called. \nWater detection is taken as an analogue input to Arduino. \nUpper\
    \ and lower boundaries are required for water detection. \nThe upper boundary\
    \ is required to determine the presence of \nwater, and the lower boundary lets\
    \ the water subside in the \npipe after the water pump has been turned off. The\
    \ ﬂowchart \nfor watering detection is shown in Fig. 9. \nTwo states of mobile\
    \ display are described as follows to let \nthe farmers know the watering status.\
    \ \n1) Watering has started: Indicates that watering has been \nexecuted as scheduled\
    \ and the water pump has been activated \nfor a duration speciﬁed by user. This\
    \ is activated when the \nsensor detects water, and the API “watering start” is\
    \ called. \n2) Watering has stopped: Indicates that watering has \nstopped, and\
    \ the API “watering stop” is called when the sensor \ndetects that the water has\
    \ subsided below the lower boundaries. \nWe designed two modules, type A and type\
    \ B, for watering \nand power outage sensors. For type A, the watering and power\
    \ \noutage sensors are combined in one module. This design is \nsuitable for fertigation\
    \ sites where watering sensors can be \ninstalled in close proximity to the power\
    \ outage sensor. \nThe type B module shown in Fig. 10 is designed for large \n\
    fertigation sites. The type B module allows the watering and \npower outage sensors\
    \ to be installed in different locations, thus \nincreasing the flexibility for\
    \ extended range. We used Long \nRange (LoRa) connectivity [35-37] for greater\
    \ connection \nbetween the watering and power outage detection sensors \nbefore\
    \ data is sent to the cloud server via the GSM module. \nThe GSM module requires\
    \ a lot of power to transmit data to \nthe server. The LoRa wireless transmission\
    \ cannot run on the \nArduino Uno processor due to its large memory requirement.\

    \ Sensors for Fertigation \nSystem (Type B Module). \nC. Software System and Mobile\
    \ Monitoring Interfaces \nTo ensure our watering and power outage detection sensors\
    \ \nare functional 24 hours a day, Arduino will send the “I am \nalive” API to\
    \ the server every hour. The backend processor \nwill receive this “post” API\
    \ and update the database. This \ninformation will be sent to the mobile apps\
    \ when they send the \n“get” API, and the “sensor is online” status will appear\
    \ on the \nmobile app dashboard. The “I am alive” flowchart is shown in \nFig.\
    \ 11. However, if the server does not receive this API, it will \nstate that the\
    \ system is not working and post this status on the \nmobile app's dashboard.\
    \ \nTable III shows all the “get” APIs, from the hardware to the \nbackend processor.\
    \ The backend processor will act according \nto the API, whether it receives data\
    \ to record changes in the \ndatabase or to send a notification to a Firebase\
    \ server. \nThe proposed system consists of a web application for a \nsystem administrator\
    \ or head farmer to efficiently manage the \nplanting cycle. Fig. 12 shows the\
    \ administrator page, where the \nadministrator is responsible for adding the\
    \ following \ninformation to the system. \n1) Planting schedule: The planting\
    \ schedule will have the \ntotal time of growth, from first transplanting to harvesting.\
    \ The \nschedule contains information on when to spray pesticides and \nwhen the\
    \ polybag should be maintained by which group of \nfarmers. \n2) Authorizing the\
    \ users (farmers) in the system and \nassigning them to specific groups. \n3)\

    2) To notify farmers of the watering status so they can \nfollow the schedule.\
    \ \n3) To show the history of watering so farmers can estimate \nthe volume of\

    \ type and \nvolume of pesticide used. \n5) To assign farmers to maintain the\
    \ fertigation site with \nactivities such as cleaning and weeding. \n6) To manage\

    \ and Evaluation \nTo validate our system, type A watering and power outage \n\
    sensors were installed at the fertigation site. A water tank with \na capacity\
    \ of 70 litres and a water piping system capable of \nwatering 1000 pots of plants\
    \ are shown in Fig. 13. The farming \nactivities under the fertigation system\
    \ for the red chili Centil \nwere used for benchmarking. \nE. Wireless Connection\
    \ to Cloud Server via Internet Service \nProvider \nA GSM module is used to send\
    \ data to a server in the \ncloud. The module is connected to the internet service\
    \ \nprovider, enabling APIs to be sent to the server. The GSM \nmodule has an\
    \ LED indicator that blinks rapidly every second \nthe GSM is not connected to\
    \ the network. When the module is \nsending a request signal to connect to the\
    \ network, the LED \nblinks every three seconds, and, when the blinking reaches\
    \ an \neven slower speed, it indicates that the net-work connection \nhas been\
    \ established. Since connecting to the network requires \na high current consumption,\
    \ an adaptor with power ration of \n9V 2A is used to power up the GSM module as\
    \ shown in \nFig. 14. \n \n \nFig. 13. The Fertigation Site where the System is\

    \ AND DISCUSSION \nWe discuss two elements for improvement. The first \nelement\
    \ involves the farming work-flow, and the second \ninvolves design-related module\
    \ performance. \nA. Improving Farming Work-Flow by the System \nThe proposed system\
    \ automates the first block in Fig. 2 \n(namely “watering”), which has been identified\
    \ as inefficient in \ngrowth monitoring. Workers are required to be on-site to\
    \ \nobserve the watering for 20 minutes in the morning and 20 \nminutes in the\
    \ afternoon. The proposed system improved the \nfarming work-flow by reducing\
    \ manpower while maintaining \nthe same yield production. Manpower was calculated\
    \ based on \nthree variables: project duration, number of hours per worker, \n\
    and number of workers. The project duration for the chili \nCentil, from transplant\
    \ to harvest, was six months. A worker \nworked for five days a week to perform\
    \ daily tasks, as shown \nin Fig. 2 that include: \n1) Observe watering: 40 minutes.\
    \ \n2) Plant inspection to check for health: 40 minutes. \n3) Inspection for disease:\
    \ 20 minutes. \nThus, the three tasks required 100 minutes (1.67 hours) for \n\
    each worker per day. The calculation considered 20 working \ndays per month for\
    \ six months (120 days). The manpower \ncalculation is shown in Table V. \nA typical\
    \ fertigation-based system requires 200.4 hours, \nwhereas the proposed system\
    \ requires 120 hours. Thus, with \nthis system, we reduce man-power by 40%. The\
    \ man-hour \nreduction would be more significant for a big farming site that \n\
    requires extensive monitoring. Five workers are required for \n1,000 plants, which\
    \ means a larger farm's manpower can be \nfurther reduced. In the cost relationship\
    \ shown in Fig. 15, the \nreduction in man-hours not only improved the operational\
    \ cost, \nbut increased the yield production as well. \nTABLE V. \nMAN-POWER CALCULATION\

    \ of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, \nVol. 12, No. 7, 2021 \nB. Water\
    \ Detection Sensor \nThe experiments were performed using two types of \nwatering\
    \ detection sensors. The first type was custom designed \nwith two protruding\
    \ gold pins. The pins are not connected \nelectrically, and act as a switch. Without\
    \ water presence, the \nsensor has an extremely low voltage (around 0.0-0.4 volts).\
    \ \nHowever, when water is flowing, depending on how \nsubmerged the pins are\
    \ or how strong the flow is, when more \nof the pins' surface area is covered\
    \ with water, the voltage will \nincrease. At the highest water flow, it is possible\
    \ to achieve \nover 2.8 volts across the pins. In a perfect water flow system,\
    \ \nthe value will drop or rise instantly between the “water \ndetection” and\
    \ “water not detected” stages. However, due to \nthe nature of the pipes used,\
    \ some excess water may still be \npresent in the pipes when the water stops flowing.\
    \ Thus, the \nvoltage drop is not instantaneous. \nFor example, from high water\
    \ flow we will get 2.8 volts, \nand the voltage drops to 2.5 volts when the pump\
    \ is stopped. \nAs time progresses, the voltage will decrease as the water \n\
    flows towards the end of the piping system and water levels \ndrop slowly. However,\
    \ this value is constantly fluctuating due \nto the formless nature of water,\
    \ which causes some motion \nwithin the pipe. As such, it can be deduced that\
    \ an optimal \n“water detection” voltage value would be any voltage higher \n\
    than 2.7 volts (upper boundary) and “water not detected” can \nbe any value below\
    \ that (lower boundary). When the water \npump is activated, there will be an\
    \ instant rise in voltage, \nexceeding the upper boundaries, and a sudden drop\
    \ in voltage \nto below the lower boundaries over a short period of time. \nTherefore,\
    \ a few seconds are given for the sensor to stabilize \nbefore the API “watering\
    \ start” is sent to the server. \nOther experiments were conducted with a typical\
    \ inline \nwater flow sensor made for an Arduino-based environment \nwith three\
    \ pole connections for 5V voltage input, one digital \ndata pin, and a ground\
    \ pin. However, the digital pin does not \nconnect to the standard digital input\
    \ pins on Arduino, but must \nbe connected to Arduino where Pulse Width Modulation\
    \ \n(PWM) is allowed. This connection enables Arduino to make \nthe necessary\
    \ calculations to transcribe data from the sensor \ninto a readable format for\
    \ the user. The sensor functions \nthrough the rotational motion created by an\
    \ electric rotor. The \nrotational speed of this rotor depends on the rate of\
    \ water \ntravelling through the sensor. The sensor, which is based on the \n\
    Hall effects phenomenon, will then send a corresponding pulse \nsignal to Arduino.\
    \ The rate at which the pulse signal is received \nwill directly correlate to\
    \ the rate of water flow: that is, slower \npulses mean a lower flow rate, while\
    \ faster pulses mean a \nhigher rate. \nAn “API Start” API token is sent when\
    \ the upper boundary \nis reached. We calculated the upper boundary by measuring\
    \ the \nreading of the irrigation system. The lower boundary for \nsending the\
    \ “watering stop” API token was set to zero. This is \nbecause when the water\
    \ flow stops, even though there may still \nbe water in the pipes, the value of\
    \ the water flow will be set to \n0 as long as the water is not moving. The measured\
    \ value of \nthe water flow was calculated in liter per minute (l/m). Some \n\
    precautionary steps were taken when using the water flow \nsensor. Firstly, the\
    \ water flow sensor had a small diameter to \nallow a pipe to fit on it. Appropriate\
    \ adaptors were used when \nthe pipe was larger than the hole of the water flow\
    \ sensor. \nSecondly, most commercial Arduino-based water flow sensors \nhave\
    \ a maximum flow rate of 30 (l/m). In addition, it is unclear \nif higher water\
    \ flow directly influences the accuracy and \nefficiency of the water flow sensor.\
    \ It is currently unclear if \nthis damages or adversely affects the sensor in\
    \ any way. \nC. Battery-Powered Solar Cell Charging and Discharging \nRate \n\
    Since the system is operated by a back-up battery in the \ncase of power failure,\
    \ we analyzed the total operating time of \nthe back-up supply by studying the\
    \ battery’s charge and \ndischarge time. To control the charging process as well\
    \ as to \nprotect the battery from overcharging, the level at which the \nbattery\
    \ will supply sufficient power was noted. \nAn experiment was conducted to study\
    \ the rate of power \nloss for the 18650 battery over time without direct power\
    \ from \nthe mains. The experiment was conducted with the system \nrunning, and\
    \ voltage measurements were taken across the \nbattery. The experiments were conducted\
    \ a few times, and the \naverage readings were calculated. The result of the discharge\
    \ \ntime is illustrated in Fig. 16. \nExperiment 1 in Fig. 16 shows the voltage\
    \ loss over time \nfor a battery initially charged up to 4V. There is a slow semi-\n\
    linear loss of voltage over time until around 3.3V, where the \nvoltage will reduce\
    \ exponentially until a value of 2.2V is \nreached. Experiment 2 was conducted\
    \ to determine whether \nthis pattern could be replicated. Experiment 2 shows\
    \ the \nvoltage loss over time for a battery that has been fully charged \nto\
    \ 4.17V. Similar to the first experiment, the voltage indicates a \nslow, semi-linear\
    \ decrease until around 3.3V, where the rate of \nvoltage discharge increases\
    \ tremendously in an exponential \nfashion. It can also be seen that the final\
    \ voltage of 2.2 V will \nremain for a period of time and will not decrease further.\
    \ \nDuring these experiments, the system was able to run as long \nas the voltage\
    \ was above 2.2V; however, after this point, \nalthough the voltage did not decrease\
    \ further, Arduino and the \nGSM module would be off. This indicated that the\
    \ system did \nnot have the required power to run. Experiment 1 showed that \n\
    the sys-tem can run up to 6.7 hours, whereas experiment 2 \nshowed that the system\
    \ can last for 8.3 hours de-pending on the \ninitial charged voltage of the battery.\

    D. Study of Switching during Power Outage \nIn the event of power failure, supply\
    \ is cut off from the \nmain. The designed circuit instantaneously switches to\
    \ the \nbattery charged by the solar cell. The switching processes from \n752\
    \ | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced\
    \ Computer Science and Applications, \nVol. 12, No. 7, 2021 \nmain supply to battery\
    \ and vice versa were observed in terms \nof response time. In this case, the\
    \ transient response of the \ntransition time for both cases was observed. There\
    \ is a small \nperiod in which the module switches to a new power source \nwhen\
    \ another has stopped. Fig. 17(a) shows the voltage against \nthe transition time\
    \ between main supply and battery-powered \noperation. On the contrary, Fig. 17(b)\
    \ shows the transient result \nof the voltage of the switching state between battery-operated\
    \ \nto the adaptor-operated supplies. \nFig. 17 shows that it took 400 microseconds\
    \ for both \nsituations to switch from one state to another, as de-noted by \n\
    the bandwidth of both pulses. Essentially, when the states are \nswitched from\
    \ one power source to another, this creates a \ntransient that can be measured\
    \ as denoted by the peaks in the \ngraph. Thus, the time it takes for the switching\
    \ to occur is \nmeasured by the time it takes for the transient peak to rise and\
    \ \nfall. A short switch time is ideal, as it ensures that the system \nwill have\
    \ constant power and can efficiently switch between \npower sources with minimal\
    \ transition. Arduino will go to reset \nstate if the transition takes too long,\
    \ and the whole system will \nbe reset. \nE. Comparison Study \nTable VI highlights\
    \ the comparison between the proposed \nsystem and the previously developed intelligent\
    \ systems in \nterm of key features that record real-time irrigation of plants,\
    \ \nthe duration of scheduled irrigation for each cycle, the history \nof nutrients\
    \ supplied to the plants, and, more importantly, an \nalert sent to farmers so\
    \ that quick action can be taken during a \npower outage to prevent severe damage\
    \ to the plants. Our \nmonitoring system is an attempt to present a solution that\
    \ \nrecords the length of the irrigation process, notiﬁes farmers in \nthe event\
    \ of power failure, and tracks the irrigation history \nthrough an easy-to-use\
    \ mobile application that guides farmers \nand farm workers. The solution is a\
    \ user-friendly platform that \ndoes not require any knowledge of programming.\

    \ \nVol. 12, No. 7, 2021 \nF. Limitation and Future Work \nThe developed system\
    \ was developed for chili fertigation \nfarming of 1000 pots of plant. So far,\
    \ it also only been tested in \na location that is prone to electrical blackout.\
    \ Although, the \nresults show significant improvement over the conventional \n\
    method applied on the same scope, the results and performance \nwill be more accurate\
    \ if the system is tested over various kinds \nof plants with larger pots (~2000\
    \ pots and more) and the data \nare observed over longer period of time i.e. three\
    \ to six months. \nFurthermore, the proposed system should also be tested in \n\
    various locations that are prone to blackouts to further evaluate \nis effectiveness\
    \ and efficiency. \nV. CONCLUSION \nIn this paper, we have demonstrated a systematic\
    \ and \nautomated method for monitoring large-scale chili fertigation \narea in\
    \ order to improve the farm management efficiency and \nconsequently to improve\
    \ plant growth in a power-outage-prone \narea. The system, which consists of sensors\
    \ for detecting \nirrigation activities and power outages, a mobile application\
    \ to \nmanage scheduling for pesticide delivery and polybag \ncleaning, and a\
    \ web application to al-low farmers to manage \nplanting schedules has shown improvement\
    \ in efficiency in \nfarming management, with a 40% reduction in manpower in \n\
    this power outage-prone area, compared to a typical \nfertigation-based farming\
    \ sys-tem in such area. The proposed \nsystem also exhibited greater control over\
    \ plant growth and \nautomatically records pesticide schedules and polybag \n\
    cleaning, all of which could improve crop yields. We believe \nthe findings and\
    \ the method of using IoT platform as a \nsystematic monitoring mechanism, presented\
    \ in this paper, will \npave the way and encourage further use in broader plant\
    \ types, \nwhich could prove useful in a large farming area in rural sites. \n\

    \ \n \n \nAgriculture plays a significant role in the development of a nation\
    \ and \nprovides the main source of food production, income, and employment to\
    \ \nnations. It was the most practiced occupation in Nigeria and this formed the\
    \ \nbackbone of the economy in the early 1960s before the discovery of crude \n\
    oil, which has led to the derail of sufficient food production, exportation, and\
    \ \nthe agricultural economy at large. Over time, the dry season has always been\
    \ \nchallenging with little or no rainfall and there are no irrigation facilities\
    \ that \nincorporate different saving practices to adapt to these climate changes\
    \ on \ntheir own. In this paper, a cost-effective internet of things irrigation\
    \ system \nthat is capable of reducing water wastage, manual labor, monitoring\

    INTRODUCTION  \nWater scarcity is currently one of the world's most pressing issues.\
    \ Water is required for the survival \nof all humans, animals, and plants in our\
    \ daily activities. It is a basic need for everyone and a valuable natural \n\
    resource for all living things on the planet [1]. Agriculture is one of the most\
    \ water-intensive fields, and the \navailability of water in agriculture helps\
    \ to regulate the temperature of the soil, cools the plants, essential for \n\
    the germination of seeds, the growth of plant roots, and the multiplication of\
    \ soil organisms. Due to \npopulation growth and increased food demand, agriculture\
    \ alone uses about 85% of the available freshwater \nresources worldwide [2].\
    \ Water is a limited resource for agricultural production, therefore, for greater\
    \ yields, \ncareful use of it through irrigation, which is one of the techniques\
    \ for conserving and controlling water \nwastage, and also allows farmers to avoid\
    \ dependence on rainwater [3], [4]. It is important to optimize the \n      \n\
      \n \n       ISSN: 2252-8776 \nInt J Inf & Commun Technol, Vol. 11, No. 1, April\
    \ 2022: 65-75 \n66 \nuse of available water resources, which can be achieved through\
    \ a combination of crop selection, water \nmonitoring techniques, and an efficient\
    \ irrigation method. Traditional irrigation methods face many \nchallenges such\
    \ as wastage of water, high cost of hiring human power, and also the farmers must\
    \ be present \nin their farmland in order to do irrigation process. Hence, the\
    \ development of an internet of things (IoT) \nbased smart irrigation and tank\
    \ monitoring system to reduce water wastage, minimize human effort, and \nremotely\
    \ monitoring of water level and water supply via the internet. The use of IoT\
    \ allows organizations and \nindividuals to access information, and facilitates\
    \ important decision-making processes, it is based on \nincreased machine-to-machine\
    \ communication and decreased human-to-human or human-to-computer \ninteraction.\
    \ IoT refers to a wireless network between objects, enabling a new form of communication\
    \ \nbetween people and things. It enables things to take action on their own,\
    \ thus eliminating the human-centric \nmediation role [5]. In general, the major\
    \ importance of a smart irrigation system is its ability to save water \ncompared\
    \ to conventional watering methods that waste as much as 50% of the water used\
    \ which causes \ninefficiencies in irrigation, evaporation, and overwatering of\
    \ the crops. Several automated techniques based \non IoT have been proposed for\
    \ irrigation systems these include the use of Bluetooth, ZigBee, Wi-Fi, cellular,\
    \ \nand other communication technologies to make the system smart. However, these\
    \ techniques have their \nshortfalls such as Bluetooth and ZigBee which cannot\
    \ handle long-distance transmission, and cellular-based \ntechniques with the\
    \ problem of high-power consumption and increase operating costs, but provide\
    \ a wide \nrange of communication [6]. The designed system uses Wi-Fi technology\
    \ to provide a low-cost design for a \nsmart irrigation system, monitors water\
    \ tank level, and is easy to access in the farmland.  \nThe rest of this paper\
    \ is prepared in the following sections. Section 2 discusses the related works\
    \ in \nsmart irrigation systems with a detailed description of existing systems.\
    \ Section 3 focuses on the architecture \nof the designed system with details\
    \ of components used, circuit diagram, and flow chart. Section 4 \nimplementation\
    \ of the design system and results are discussed. Finally, the last section discusses\
    \ the \nconclusion and future research. \n \n \n2. \nRELATED WORKS \nThe researchers\
    \ in [7], [8], proposed a real-time automation system based on an ARM7TDMI core\
    \ \n32-bit microprocessor and global system for mobile communication (GSM) module\
    \ which operate through \nshort message service (SMS) as a link between advanced\
    \ RISC machine (ARM) processor and centralized \nunit. GSM is used to inform the\
    \ user about the exact field condition via SMS. The system constantly \nmonitors\
    \ the soil moisture, water level, temperature, and humidity, and provides details\
    \ about the field to the \nuser via SMS. The GSM transmits this data to the ARM7\
    \ for processing and displays the output on a liquid \ncrystal display (LCD).\
    \ The activation instruction starts the motor and indirectly activates the transistorized\
    \ \nrelay circuit, which continuously monitors environmental parameters and turns\
    \ off the motor whenever the \nrequired level is reached, sending a message to\
    \ the farmer. The drawback of the system proposed by [7], is \nthat GSM has a\
    \ fixed maximum cell site range of 35 km which is imposed by technical limitations.\
    \ Secondly, \nit is not user-friendly to farmers due to the entire complexity\
    \ of AT commands, and finally, soil parameters \nregarding fertilizers and plant\
    \ diseases are not incorporated into the system. \nWireless sensors and dual tone\
    \ multiple frequency (DTMF) dialing were used in an irrigation \nmanagement system\
    \ [9]. DTMF used is a combination of one low frequency and one high-frequency\
    \ tone to \nidentify the dialed number or a signal. The designed system allows\
    \ farmers to control irrigation and provides \na remote-control facility by switching\
    \ it (ON/OFF) using the landline or mobile phone by dialing specific \nDTMF codes\
    \ GSM network. However, the use of DTMF makes it less user-friendly and also offers\
    \ limited \ncontrol options. Similar research based on wireless networks and DTMF\
    \ was proposed by [10], their \nproposed system used one single module to control\
    \ all the sectors automatically, and maintain irrigation time. \nIt is a low-cost\
    \ design with no extra internet cost that can work over a long distance but does\
    \ give \ninformation about the water tank level.  \nAbbas et al. [11], proposed\
    \ a smart irrigation system using a wireless sensor network. The system \nused\
    \ moisture sensors to detect the soil moisture and helps to identify the water\
    \ holding capacity of different \nsoil characteristics based on the fact that\
    \ the different plants consume water differently. The design is aimed \nat determining\
    \ the time taken for the sensors to get activated and to identify the watering\
    \ zone. However, the \nsystem does not take into account other factors like monitoring\
    \ the water tank level. A voice-controlled \nirrigation system that can be controlled\
    \ using an authorized mobile phone is described in [12]. The system is \nmade\
    \ up of two sub-units; a pump control unit (PCU) and a farm control unit (FCU).\
    \ The soil moisture is \nmonitored and irrigation valves are controlled by the\
    \ FCU, while the pump operation is controlled by the \nPCU, which is based on\
    \ the water level in the tank. The voice commands from the user’s mobile phone\
    \ and \nsoil moisture with water level data were used to control the system. The\
    \ designed system offers a low-cost \ndesign with low latency.  \nInt J Inf &\
    \ Commun Technol  \nISSN: 2252-8776 \n \n \nAn internet of things based irrigation\
    \ and tank monitoring system (Tayo Dorcas Obasanya) \n67 \nMasaba et al. [13]\
    \ proposed a smart irrigation system to improve water-energy efficiency. Their\
    \ \nsystem consists of a microcontroller, sensors, and a water pump that is integrated\
    \ with the decision-making \nsystem. The system makes its decision on whether\
    \ irrigation is needed by developing a truth table using \nenvironmental information.\
    \ The sensors used in the design are temperature and moisture sensor which serves\
    \ \nas input parameters for the truth table and are placed in the area that requires\
    \ irrigation. A decision was made \nbased on input parameters by activating the\
    \ sprinklers. The microcontroller communicates with sensors using \nBluetooth\
    \ technology and collects data from moisture sensors and temperature sensors.\
    \ The data collected are \nevaluated through a truth table to determine whether\
    \ the given region needs to be irrigated. Their system \nprovides an effective\
    \ irrigation schedule system and improved water-energy efficiency.  \nThe use\
    \ of a wireless network, a motor controller unit (PIC16F877A), and a GSM module\
    \ with \nwireless valve control to provide a low-cost irrigation system is proposed\
    \ for an IoT-based irrigation system \nand water consumption for crops in research\
    \ by [14]. Another smart irrigation system based on a wireless \nsensor network\
    \ with dual tone multiple frequency (DTMF) is developed by [15]. The developed\
    \ system uses \nan 8051 microcontroller, soil moisture sensor, temperature sensor,\
    \ and dual tone multiple frequency (DTMF) \nreceiver to calculate, control, and\
    \ monitor the water requirements for crops based on soil moisture data \nacquired\
    \ by numerous sensors nodes deployed in the field. The developed system is low-cost,\
    \ and it also \nprotects the soil's fertility by significantly minimizing soil\
    \ leakage.  \nKumar [16] proposed an automatic irrigation and security system\
    \ that uses a wireless sensor \nnetwork (WSN). The designed system consists of\
    \ Raspberry Pi, Arduino, a transceiver, and three sensors \n(soil moisture, temperature,\
    \ and passive infrared sensor (PIR)). The Raspberry Pi serves as a coordinator\
    \ \nnode (CR node) and Arduino serves as an end node device with nRF24L01 transceiver\
    \ for wireless \ncommunication and data transfer. The sensors read soil status\
    \ and wirelessly transferred the data to the \nRaspberry Pi to activate the water\
    \ pump. This system monitors the condition of the farm on the webpage and \ncan\
    \ turn on/off the water pump through the webpage. The PIR sensor with a buzzer\
    \ was used to protect the \ncrop from the cattle entering the field. The system\
    \ has improved the problem of water wastage in farmland, \nhence resulting in\
    \ increased yield and more profit to the farmer. A similar system was designed\
    \ by Bolu et al.  \n[17] using Arduino Mega 2568 and nRF24L01 transceiver with\
    \ five sensors to perform a low-cost automated \nirrigation system powered by\
    \ solar energy.  \nSavić and Radonjic [18] proposed a ZigBee-based wireless sensor\
    \ network (WSN) system with a \nDHT11 sensor for air temperature measurement and\
    \ an Arduino-based sensor node (Watermark 200SS) for \nsoil moisture measurement\
    \ and a DHT11 sensor for air temperature measurement. The system was \nimplemented\
    \ using the Libelium Waspmote microcontroller platform as the main control unit\
    \ of the proposed \nsmart irrigation system. The system is simple and low-cost\
    \ to implement with reliable data transmission that \ndelivers necessary information\
    \ for independent decision-making in a smart irrigation system, but the range\
    \ of \noperation is limited. Also, [19] proposed a wireless sensor network system\
    \ for IoT-based irrigation systems \nusing a Pic microcontroller and GSM module,\
    \ their system can be monitored via smartphone or personal \ncomputer. \nAlso,\
    \ Leh et al. [20] designed a smart irrigation system, the system is split into\
    \ two parts: hardware \nand software. Three components make up the hardware: a\
    \ soil moisture sensor, a temperature and humidity \nsensor (DHT 11), and an ESP\
    \ 8266 Wi-Fi module connected to an Arduino Mega 2560 microprocessor. The \nmicrocontroller\
    \ processes data from sensors that automatically water the plants and analyze\
    \ the real-time soil \nstatus of the plants via an internet-connected smartphone.\
    \ The Blynk application software is installed on the \nsmartphone and connected\
    \ to the hardware implementation, which uses the DHT 11 sensor and moisture \n\
    level sensor to detect the plant's status. The designed system compared their\
    \ results over a seven-day normal \nirrigation system. The findings show that\
    \ smart irrigation systems outperformed normal irrigation systems. \nThe system\
    \ can be controlled from a smartphone by the farmer, but when implemented in large\
    \ quantities, it \nis expensive because every plant must be equipped with sensors\
    \ to know the condition of the soil, and a water \npump must be installed for\
    \ every plant to supply water. \nSudharshan et al. [21] proposed smart irrigation\
    \ to reduce the wastage of water using a temperature \nsensor, humidity sensor,\
    \ and soil moisture sensor with an Arduino microcontroller. The system uses fuzzy\
    \ \nlogic rules to operate the solenoid valve based on data acquired from the\
    \ sensors which are later sent to the \ncloud using adafruit.io where the farmer\
    \ can see the values obtained by the three sensors. The system is \npowered by\
    \ a solar panel to run the pumps.  \n \n \n3. \nPRESENTATION OF THE DEVELOPED\
    \ SYSTEM \nThe designed system is an Internet of Things-based irrigation and tank\
    \ monitoring system, which is \ndivided into hardware and software components.\
    \ The system's hardware components are installed with an \nATMEGA328P microcontroller\
    \ for hardware development. The installation is accomplished in stages. The \n\
    architecture of the system is shown in Figure 1. \n      \n  \n \n       ISSN:\

    \ \n \n \n3.1.  Hardware specification \nIn the design of the system, the following\
    \ hardware components were used to achieve the \npurpose; Arduino UNO microcontroller\
    \ board (ATMEGA328P), HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor, soil moisture \nsensor, solenoid\
    \ valve, liquid crystal display (LCD), Wi-Fi ESP8266 module, power supply, driver\
    \ circuit \n(IRF3205, 10kΩResistor, 1N4007 Diode). \n \n3.1.1. Arduino UNO \n\
    The Arduino UNO is a microcontroller board based on the ATMEGA328P microcontroller,\
    \ which \nruns at 5 V, 16 MHz clock speed, 14 digital input/out pins, 6 analog\
    \ input (A0–A5) pins, 6 PWM outputs, 1 \nuniversal asynchronous receiver transmitter\
    \ (UART), and programming interface (USB) via ATMega16U2. \nThe Arduino UNO microcontroller\
    \ has one or more central processing units (CPUs), memory, and \nprogrammable\
    \ input/output peripherals that are geared for embedded use. It consists of a\
    \ programmable \ncircuit board and ready-to-use software called the Arduino integrated\
    \ development environment (IDE), which \nis used to write and upload C/C++ computer\
    \ code to the physical board. Arduino can also be connected to \na  cloud or t\
    \ h e  internet by interfacing it with a Wi-Fi module ESP8266. Figure 2 shows\
    \ the Arduino \nUNO board (ATMEGA328P micro-controller) used in this designed\
    \ system. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 2. Arduino UNO board ATMEGA328 micro-controller\
    \ [22] \n \n \n3.1.2. Water level sensor (ultrasonic HC-SR04) \nThe water level\
    \ sensor monitors the amount of water in the tank and determines whether there\
    \ is \nenough water to supply. The ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04 is used to measure\
    \ distances between 2cm to 400 \ncm with a 3 mm precision. A floating pad is placed\
    \ within the tank and it is planted on top of the water tank. \nThe tank's depth\
    \ is estimated by measuring the distance between the floating pad regularly, and\
    \ any changes \nare recorded in the mobile app. The basic idea of ultrasonic distance\
    \ measuring is based on echo; when \nsound waves are sent in the deployed environment,\
    \ they have reflected the source as echo after contacting \nan obstacle (water\

    \ and tank monitoring system (Tayo Dorcas Obasanya) \n69 \nThis module has only\
    \ four pins connected to the Arduino UNO, which are: \nVCC pin – \n5 V (ranging\
    \ from 4.5 to 5.5 V) \nTrig pin – \nSensor input (trigger)  \nEcho pin – \nOutput\
    \ sensor (echo)  \nGND pin– \nGround \nThe duration represents the time or response\
    \ for the signal transmitted by the trigger pin of the \nsensor to hit the surface\

    \ Soil moisture sensor \nThe water content in the soil is measured by a soil moisture\
    \ sensor. It makes use of the electrical \nresistance of the soil, which has two\
    \ probes that operate as a variable resistor. Increased water content in the \n\
    soil results in better conductivity between the probes and lower resistance. The\
    \ module has four pins, VCC, \nground, and A0 are connected respectively to the\
    \ Arduino board and parameters will be set based on the \ndatasheet. \nIt is used\
    \ to detect moisture in the field and send it to a microcontroller, which then\
    \ controls the \nwater tank or solenoid valve (ON/OFF). Figure 4 shows the soil\
    \ moisture sensor module used in the design. \nThe ADC is used to convert the\
    \ analog output of the soil moisture sensor to digital. The moisture sensor is\
    \ \nused to determine if water is present around the sensor. It is inserted into\
    \ the soil, uses two probes to conduct \nan electrical current through the soil,\
    \ and then measures the resistance to determine moisture content. The \nmore water\
    \ in the soil, the easier it is to conduct electricity (less resistance), while\
    \ dry soil conducts \nelectricity poorly (less resistance). Hence, it measures\
    \ from 0-1023 in resistance, where 300 below indicates \nmuch water, 300 to 800\
    \ indicates moist soil and 800 above indicates dry soil. In this research, less\
    \ than 600 \nindicates that the soil is wet, while above 800 indicates that the\
    \ soil is dry. \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 3. Ultrasonic HC-SR04 sensor [23] \n \n\

    \ valve is a basic electromagnetic device that converted electrical energy directly\
    \ into \nlinear mechanical motion. It was used as a water control valve. The solenoid\
    \ valve used in the designed \nsystem converts electrical energy to mechanical\
    \ energy, which then drives a mechanical valve to regulate \nthe flow of water\
    \ through the system by opening, closing, or adjusting the position of the valve.\
    \ The valve is \nclosed with no power, but when supplied with 12 V, the value\
    \ will open. To control this valve with the \nmicro-controller which runs on 5\
    \ V, the solenoid valve is connected to a driver circuit to switch on the 12 V\
    \ \nwith the small circuit input supplied by the micro-controller. Figure 5 shows\
    \ the solenoid valve used in the \nimplementation. The solenoid valve used in\
    \ this research is rated:  \n- \nVoltage=12 vdc \n- \nCoil resistance=37.5 Ω \n\
    - \nCurrent=320 mA  \n- \nPower=4.8 W  \n- \nPressure=3psi \n \n3.1.5.  Wi-Fi\
    \ module ESP8266 \nThe data must be transferred to the internet and monitored\
    \ remotely when all of the parameters have \nbeen measured and validated. This\
    \ is accomplished by the use of a Wi-Fi module, which enables real-time \nresponse.\
    \ The ESP8266 Wi-Fi module is a self-contained system-on-a-chip (SOC) with an\
    \ integrated TCP/IP \nprotocol stack that can be used to connect to your Wi-Fi\
    \ network from the microcontroller. The ESP8266 \nwas used in this designed system\
    \ to run an application or delegate Wi-Fi networking functions. Data \nexchange\
    \ between this module and the microcontroller is achieved by a logic level shifter\
    \ circuit because the \nmicrocontroller is powered with 5volt and the ESP8266\
    \ is powered by 3.3 V. Pins are arranged in two rows, \nhaving 4 on each row.\

    \ valve works at a different voltage compared to that of the Arduino board and\
    \ the two \ncannot be directly connected as the solenoid valve works with 12 volts\
    \ while the Arduino and the sensors \nwork with 5 V. Hence, the driver circuit\
    \ is employed to act as a bridge and as well as a switch. The driver \ncircuit\
    \ comprises the IRF3205 MOSFET, 10 kΩ resistors, and diode. The resistor was connected\
    \ to the leg \nof the gate, one leg of the diode was connected to the drain and\
    \ to 12 V power supply (this prevented the \ncurrent from going to the Arduino\
    \ board), and the source was connected to the ground. The MOSFET \nallows a small\
    \ dc voltage (5 V) from the Arduino digital pin to switch a larger 12 Vdc voltage\
    \ to the \nsolenoid. It can be thought of as a switch, applying a current to the\
    \ Gate which allows current to flow. The \ndiode (1N4007), which is used in this\
    \ circuit as a flyback diode connected across the inductive load \n(solenoid valve)\
    \ in order to eliminate voltage spike across the load as well as prevent the 12\
    \ V from the \nexternal supply from going back into the circuit in order not to\
    \ damage the board. \n \n \nInt J Inf & Commun Technol  \nISSN: 2252-8776 \n\

    \ in the soil and the level of water in \nthe tank respectively. The microcontroller\
    \ reads the values measured by the sensors and displays the values \nand information\
    \ on the liquid crystal display. The Wi-Fi module ESP8266 interfaced with the\
    \ microcontroller \nconnects the system to the internet, where a mobile phone\
    \ or laptop can access it. This device (mobile phone \nor laptop) searches for\
    \ the system’s Wi-Fi to connect to it, with this device the user then opens the\
    \ browser to \ncontrol the irrigation with the web application developed for this\
    \ purpose and monitor the Irrigation process \nthat is the status of the water\
    \ tank and the soil is done by loading the IP address 192.168.4.1 on the web \n\

    \ irrigation system and monitoring water tank. \nFarmers can get an update about\
    \ farmland anywhere using any internet-enabled device as a means to access \n\
    data and control the irrigation system. The device is connected to the internet\
    \ via the ESP8266 Wi-Fi module \nand can be operated remotely through internet-enabled\
    \ mobile devices such as mobile phones and laptops. \nThe system has demonstrated\
    \ that water can be preserved while achieving quality irrigation of crops. The\
    \ use \nof a soil moisture sensor helps to detect and monitor the level of water\
    \ in the soil which solves the problem of \nan uncontrolled irrigation system.\
    \ The designed system is a low-cost system with very reliable efficiency \nwhich\
    \ tends to reduce human effort and wastage of water.  \nThe system is limited\
    \ to the supply of water from the tank to the field only, refilling or pumping\
    \ \nwater to the tank was not considered. In the future, the camera can be incorporated\
    \ into the system to monitor \nfarmland and detect intrusions such as animals\
    \ and humans in the agricultural field using PIR sensor or \nimage processing\
    \ techniques. In addition, the system can be improved upon by adding a solar power\
    \ system \nwhich provides constant power to the system for pumping the water tank.\
    \ Finally, the designed system can be \nimplemented in large farm areas to ease\
    \ the stress.  \n \n \nREFERENCES \n[1] \nS. Nallani and V. B. Hency, “Low power\

  explanation: The paper discusses the development of a web application called AgroClimatic
    Evolution that provides information on reference evapotranspiration (ETo) and
    weather data to farmers. The web application was designed to provide easy access
    to data and enable farmers to make informed decisions on irrigation scheduling.
    The paper also describes the methodology used to calculate ETo and the validation
    process for the web application.

    Agroclimatic Evolution web \napplication as a powerful solution \nfor managing\
    \ climate data\nManuel Soler‑Méndez1, Dolores Parras‑Burgos2*, Rachid Benouna‑Bennouna1\
    \ & \nJosé Miguel Molina‑Martínez1\nApplying the AgroClimatic Evolution web application\
    \ allows inquiries being made, data \nbeing collected and variables being calculated\
    \ with the data acquired from different public \nagrometeorological stations on\
    \ a single platform. Today all these stations from Murcia and Andalusia \n(Spain)\
    \ are included, and stations elsewhere in Spain are being incorporated. This web\
    \ application also \noffers the possibility of including each user’s own stations,\
    \ which increases the number and availability \nof data close to each farmer’s\
    \ plots. The data collected from stations is employed to collect daily data \n\
    about weather and times, which are used to calculate the reference evapotranspiration\
    \ (ETo). All the \ndata are saved in a cloud database to later consult them and\
    \ study their evolution. The data provided \nby all the stations are validated\
    \ by applying the filters indicated in Standard UNE 500540:2004 \n“Automatic weather\
    \ stations networks” by eliminating mistaken data that could alter correct ETo\
    \ \ncalculations. With the filtered data, and having calculated ETo, the user\
    \ is provided with a comparison \nmade with the raw data supplied by public stations.\
    \ The main objective of this tool is to optimize the \nuse of water resources\
    \ available from data acquisition. Managing these data will contribute to make\
    \ \nagriculture more sustainable and compatible with the natural environment.\n\
    In recent decades, the agricultural sector has undergone marked transformation\
    \ that has evolved over time. It \ncan be stated that the first step began with\
    \ the mechanization of farm work and the introduction of fertilizers and \nphytosanitary\
    \ products. Later significant progress was made thanks to information and communication\
    \ tech-\nnologies (ICT) being introduced, which enables vast quantities of data\
    \ about soil status, water availability, crop \ndevelopment, the amount of plant\
    \ sanitary product applied to each plant, etc., to be collected and  transmitted1–6.\
    \ \nAll this, along with historic information about weather, the progression of\
    \ plagues or diseases, is leading to a \nmajor transformation in the sector that\
    \ is increasing productivity and  competition7.\nTherefore, the management and\
    \ integration of different databases will be one of the advances that will have\
    \ a \nstrong impact in forthcoming years because it will allow decisions to be\
    \ quickly, effectively and accurately made \nto optimize production and  costs8.\n\
    At the same time, this sector faces low water availability and increasingly degraded\
    \  quality9. Therefore, efficient \nwater resources management is the main tool\
    \ to confer farms stability and  sustainability10. In relation to this, \nthe\
    \ use of ICT is an excellent support to efficiently manage water  resources11.\
    \ Employing ICT in agriculture is \nbased on using sensors that monitor various\
    \ agri-environmental variables related to the soil–plant-atmosphere \ncombination\
    \ to quantify or estimate water  requirements9. Knowing environmental data allows\
    \ the evapotranspi-\nration (ET) demand in an area to be calculated, with which\
    \ the consumption of a given crop can be estimated by \napplying the corresponding\
    \ corrective coefficients. Such information can help to more efficiently manage\
    \ irriga-\ntion. As a network of public agrometeorological stations that obtain\
    \ such data exists, placing them at farmers’ \ndisposal seems important.\nDifferent\
    \ websites can be found on the Internet that offer interesting agroclimate information\
    \ to be \n consulted12–14, although some shortcomings have been detected that\
    \ should be stressed. Some examples of \nthese shortcomings are: (i) the web format\
    \ does not match that of mobile devices; (ii) data consultations are \nawkward\
    \ and slow; (iii) consulting time data is impossible; (iv) forms to consult data\
    \ are lacking; (v) data can-\nnot be plotted as graphs; (vi) there are no weather\
    \ forecasts; (vii) no basic data about stations to make inquiries \nwith are available.\n\

    In order to overcome these deficiencies and to offer users a practical and efficient\
    \ tool, a web application \nhas been developed to: (i) consult ETo; (ii) consult\
    \ data from the different selected stations; (iii) obtain weather \nforecasts.\
    \ The aim of this project is to have a web application that meets a series of\
    \ minimum characteristics that: \n(a) is simple; (b) offers a responsive presentation,\
    \ that is, it adapts to different devices; (c) serves to collect data \nin real\
    \ time to calculate daily ET and its time to be later stored in a database.\n\
    Another objective of this project is for users to make accurate irrigation decisions\
    \ by bearing in mind informa-\ntion on the ET demand offered by this tool. This\
    \ allows improved water resources management without having \nto invest in any\
    \ sensors network.\nMaterials and methods\nWebsites analysis. \nThere are two\
    \ types of web-based weather information systems:\na) Private stations: These\
    \ allow data to be obtained close to each farmer’s plot, provided that as many\
    \ weather \nstations as are of interest are invested. This is an advantage in\
    \ terms of the representativeness of the data for \neach farmer; however, it has\
    \ the disadvantage of the high cost of the investment.\n \ni. An example is the\
    \ service offered by Sencrop (www. sencr op. com), which centralises all the data\
    \ \nfrom privately installed stations on one platform (if the owner so wishes)\
    \ and makes them available \nto other users, thus reducing the investment cost.\n\
    \ \nii. Another example is offered by Envira IOT (www. envir aiot. es/ monit oriza\
    \ cion- meteo rolog ica- \nagric ultura- preci sion/), which installs a private\
    \ weather station and offers data provided with \nalgorithms that facilitate user\
    \ interpretation.\nb) Public stations: There are numerous web services that offer\
    \ historical weather data collected from the existing \nnetwork of weather stations\
    \ in Spain. In general, access to these data is free of charge, but the microclimate\
    \ \nof a particular farm may differ from the data provided by the nearest weather\
    \ station.\n \ni. SIAR (Agro-climatic Information System for Irrigation) (https://\
    \ eport al. mapa. gob. es/ websi ar/ \nInicio. aspx) offers data from stations\
    \ located throughout Spain, through its website (and even has \na mobile App).\n\
    \ \nii. At the level of autonomous communities, some offer this service through\
    \ their own portals, with \ndata from the same stations: SIAM of the Region of\
    \ Murcia (www. siam. imida. es), InfoRiego of \nthe “Junta de Castilla y León”\
    \ (www. infor iego. org/ openc ms/ openc ms/ info_ meteo/ index. html), \nRIA\
    \ of the “Junta de Andalucía” (https:// www. junta deand alucia. es/ agric ultur\
    \ aypes ca/ ifapa/ \nriaweb/ web/), among others.\nThe potential of the data collected\
    \ in these services lies in their free access, and in the quality of the data\
    \ \ncoming from a Spanish network. On the other hand, the consultation of data\
    \ is, in general, not user-friendly, \nnor is it adapted to mobile devices. In\
    \ addition, data are consulted whose processing requires considerable office \n\
    skills to be interpreted. These services lack the ability to graph the data, and\
    \ the possibility of easily storing them \nin their own database.\nTaking into\
    \ account the study carried out, the AgroClimatic Evolution web application was\
    \ developed, \ndesigned to provide free access to data to users, in a user-friendly\
    \ and simple way. But this application is part of \na broader project, the GENHIDRO\
    \ platform (www. genhi dro. es), aimed at the efficient and autonomous man-\n\
    agement of fertigation systems.\nTherefore, the aim of this project is to ensure\
    \ that the data obtained through AgroClimatic Evolution are not \nmerely a mere\
    \ visualisation and storage of data, but feed a more complex decision-making system\
    \ for advice and \neven the direct management of fertigation systems. GENHIDRO\
    \ is a platform under continuous development \nand aims to offer the user the\
    \ possibility of interacting with the irrigation system based on data collected,\
    \ among \nothers, from meteorological information services such as those consulted\
    \ through AgroClimatic Evolution.\nTheorical background. \nThe ETo was calculated\
    \ in this project. This ETo concept occurs under certain \nconditions, on a reference\
    \ surface and with no water restrictions. The ETo is a variable to study atmospheric\
    \ ET \ndemand regardless of crop type and crop development.\nBy relating ET to\
    \ a given surface, a reference ET is obtained. From this value, ET values on other\
    \ surfaces can \nbe related. This will allow analyses based on ET alone, and independent\
    \ of other site-specific variables. Thus, \nETo will be the reference ET under\
    \ certain growing conditions, for a reference crop. The ETo value will express\
    \ \nthe evapotranspiration capacity of the atmosphere at a given location and\
    \ time of year; but it does not take into \naccount the characteristics of the\
    \ crop or soil type. The great advantage of using ETo to estimate water require-\n\
    ments is that its value only depends on climatic parameters, which are easy to\
    \ obtain.\nTo understand the ETo concept, it is necessary to define what a reference\
    \ surface is. According to FAO-56, it \nis a “hypothetical reference crop with\
    \ crop height of 0.12 m, a fixed surface resistance of 70 s  m-1 and an albedo\
    \ \nvalue (i.e., portion of light reflected by the leaf surface) of 0.23”15.\n\
    To calculate this parameter, the FAO Penman–Monteith method is recommended because\
    \ it is the only stand-\nardized method that determines ETo with climate  parameters16.\
    \ This method of Zotarelli was selected because \nit roughly approaches the ETo\
    \ of any town, has robust physical bases, and explicitly incorporates physiological\
    \ \n3\nVol.:(0123456789)\nScientific Reports |         (2022) 12:6716  | \nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-10316-7\n\
    www.nature.com/scientificreports/\nand aerodynamic parameters. The data required\
    \ to apply the FAO Penman–Monteith method are location, \ntemperature, relative\
    \ humidity, radiation and wind.\nDetermining ETo is extremely important for estimating\
    \ a crop’s water requirements or for conducting studies \nregardless of the crop\
    \ type to be grown. Knowledge about ETo and the grown crop allows adjusted irrigation\
    \ \ndoses to be established and crop performance to improve.\nTo calculate the\
    \ ETo, we applied the equations of the FAO Penman–Monteith method available in\
    \ FAO-56. \nWe began with daily ETo, calculated by the expression below:\nwhere:\n\
    ETo  Reference evapotranspiration [mm  day-1]\nRnNet radiation the crop’s surface(MJ\
    \  m-2day-1)\nRa Extraterrestial radiation (mm  day-1)\nG Ground heat flow(MJ\

    \ pressure (kPa)\nes-ea No vapor pressure (kPa)\n\x1F Vapor pressure curve slope\
    \ (kPa °C-1)\nγ Psychometric constant (kPa °C-1)\nFor the calculation of each\
    \ and every one of the parameters involved in Eq. (1), the methodology established\
    \ \nby Zotarelli et al.16 has been followed. Thus, the daily ETo estimate is obtained,\
    \ expressed in mm·day-1.\nTo obtain the ETo value at the hourly level, the expressions\
    \ indicated by Zotarelli et al.16 vary slightly. Thus, \nfor hourly periods, the\
    \ FAO Penman–Monteith equation for the calculation of ET is modified as follows:\n\
    where:\nETo  Reference evapotranspiration [mm  hour-1]\nRn Net radiation on the\
    \ reference surface [MJ  m-2  hour-1]\nG  Ground heat flow density [MJ  m-2  hour-1]\n\

    \ follows: (http:// josem iguel. myqna \npcloud. com: 49169/ AgroC limat ic- Evolu\
    \ tion/).\nThe AgroClimatic Evolution (v1.0), web application can be used in a\
    \ PC or a mobile device (Android or IOS). \nAs this web application is executed\
    \ by means of a server, a web browser is necessary, and Chrome is recom-\nmended.\
    \ This tools’ operation is outlined in the figure below (Fig. 1).\nNode-RED (https://\
    \ noder ed. org/) is the core of the web application’s operation. It is a programming\
    \ tool \ndesigned to communicate with different hardware, simplifying the processes\
    \ of sending and receiving informa-\ntion as much as possible. It allows to connect\
    \ different hardware devices, use APIs to perform communications, \nand connect\
    \ with other services, in a very innovative and interesting way. The programming\
    \ is visual, based on \nflows, so it does not require a very advanced level of\
    \ programming.\nNode-RED uses the \"http request\" node to request data from a\
    \ specific weather station to the corresponding \nmeteorological service. The\
    \ data collected are: weather station, date, temperature, relative humidity, radiation,\
    \ \nwind speed, wind direction and dew point temperature. This information is\
    \ stored in the database, and php-\nMyAdmin (https:// www. phpmy admin. net/),\
    \ which is a free open-source software tool, is used to manage and \nadminister\
    \ the database. Another Node-RED node is in charge of calculating the hourly or\
    \ daily ETo values from \nthe obtained meteorological data. This information is\
    \ stored in the database. With the \"uibuilder\" node, the user \ninterface interprets\
    \ the information request made by the user, and extracts the appropriate information\
    \ from \nthe database to display it on the interface. This whole process works\
    \ on the back-end.\nThe system is connected to different APIs and/or web services\
    \ to acquire interesting weather data: (i) the API \nthat OpenWeather (https://\
    \ openw eathe rmap. org/) provides for weather forecasts; (ii) the API that the\
    \ “Junta \nde Andalucía” (the Regional Government of Andalusia, Spain) provides\
    \ for weather data; (iii) obtaining data \nfrom websites of SIAM (the Farming\
    \ Information System of Murcia) and SIAR (the Agroclimate Information \nSystem\

    The data provided by all the stations are validated by applying filters at levels\
    \ 0 and 1 as indicated in Standard \nUNE 500540:2004 “Automatic weather stations\
    \ networks: Guidance for the validation of the weather data from \nthe station\
    \ networks. Real time validation”. At level 0, the structure of the data record\
    \ is validated, i.e. that the \nnumber of data received is the same as the number\
    \ of data expected, as well as the date and/or time, taking as \ninvalid those\
    \ that do not comply. Level 1 establishes the physical limits within which the\
    \ different climate vari-\nables must move, beyond which data are considered null.\
    \ Table 2 shows the physical and instrumental limits \nestablished by the UNE\
    \ 500540:2004 standard. With the filtered data, and once the ETo calculations\
    \ have been \nobtained, the user is provided with a comparison made with the raw\
    \ data supplied by the public stations.\nTo validate the correct execution of\
    \ the process of obtaining data from the meteorological services mentioned, \n\
    the following test was carried out: a weather station was taken at random, during\
    \ a randomly chosen month, and \nthe data provided directly by the service were\
    \ compared with those generated by the web application developed \n(Tables 3,\
    \ 4, and 5).\nTo achieve an attractive and practical front-end, the information\
    \ has been organised with HTML, CSS and \nJavaScript programming.\nResults\nThe\
    \ result of this work is a user interface which shows the information that users\
    \ require and request. This \ninformation is taken from databases and the different\
    \ APIs. The application’s interface is divided into different \ntabs as the following\
    \ screenshots show. The Home Page offers general information about the tool (Fig. 2).\
    \ The \nsecond tab shows the followed methodology described in the previous section\
    \ (Fig. 3).\nThe third tab is Data, where various available parameters can be\
    \ consulted (Fig. 4). Here the desired agro-\nmeteorological station can be selected\
    \ by the interactive map on the left or by unfolding the menus on the right. \n\
    After selecting a station, a table appears with basic and simplified information\
    \ to learn the general details of \nwhat is selected. The map that opens was developed\
    \ by a scalable vector graphics (SVG) editor. The advantage \nof using SVG is\
    \ the scalability with which adjustments can be made in different sizes with-out\
    \ losing properties. \nDifferent sections appear at the bottom of the screen to\
    \ select the desired interval of dates and, for the Murcia \nRegion (Spain), the\
    \ option to consult the hourly ETo appears (Fig. 5).\nHaving selected the agrometeorological\
    \ station and the desired intervals, a figure and a table appear with \nthe requested\
    \ data (Fig. 6). Moreover, the Data page also shows the weather forecast, plus\
    \ further data from the \nselected station (Fig. 7).\nThe next tab of the web\
    \ application is that of stations. It shows a picture gallery to know agrometeorological\
    \ \nstations’ location (Fig. 8). An unfolding menu appears at the top with all\
    \ the options of the available stations. \nWhen a station is selected, the related\
    \ pictures are automatically obtained. The images available in the Murcia \nRegion\
    \ belong to the SIAM 13. The last tab that the web application offers is the Contact\
    \ tab, with information \nabout location, social networks and contact details.\
    \ Finally, the web application is responsive and adapts to dif-\nferent devices.\n\
    With this study, what has been achieved is to unify valuable information for the\
    \ farmer, in a responsive web \ntool, with user-friendly visualisation on both\
    \ PC and mobile devices. It also allows the data to be integrated into \nTable\

    \ system can be controlled, thus facilitating the farmer’s \nwork. In current\
    \ solutions, either a costly tool is available through private weather stations,\
    \ or an obsolete public \ndata tool is available, but which in no case allows\
    \ interaction with the fertigation system.\nConclusions\nThe AgroClimatic Evolution\
    \ web application considers developing irrigation management software with data\
    \ \ncollected from agrometeorological stations’ sensors provided or owned by different\
    \ organizations. With the data \noffered by agrometeorological stations, an adaptive\
    \ and responsive web application was developed for different \nkinds of devices\
    \ that allows daily and hourly ET to be consulted for distinct stations. The intention\
    \ of this tool is \nto improve irrigation management by making better use of water\
    \ and suitably meeting crop needs by collecting \nand analyzing these data.\n\
    This can be achieved as follows: (i) the tool facilitates calculating the climate’s\
    \ ET demand; (ii) by know-\ning crop coefficients, crop water requirements are\
    \ estimated; (iii) by knowing crop irrigation needs, both the \nquantities of\
    \ supplied water and  CO2 flow rates from land can be reduced, which also helps\
    \ to reduce the carbon \nfootprint. By doing so, and following the agricultural\
    \ policy proposals of the Council Commission and the \nEuropean Parliament about\
    \ the European Green Pact, whose aim is to pursue a climatically neutral Europe\
    \ by \n2050, work will be done to help to fulfill this objective. With the developed\
    \ web application, access can be gained \nto all information from any device in\
    \ a much simpler and more practical way to consult ETo, weather forecasts \nand\
    \ details about the selected stations.\nTable 3.  Comparison of temperature data\

    1. Introduction\nThe information technology of the farming sector is cur-\nrently\
    \ regarded as a concern to confront the many diﬃcul-\nties that arise in the area.\
    \ The development of eﬃcient and\nmore proﬁtable agriculture systems and instruments\
    \ is\nquickly increasing with environmental monitoring and\nremote control in\
    \ agriculture [1]. Precision agriculture and\nintelligent agriculture can lead\
    \ in this direction. These two\nphrases concern the integration, with traditional\
    \ agricultural\nHindawi\nWireless Communications and Mobile Computing\nVolume\
    \ 2022, Article ID 6534238, 11 pages\nhttps://doi.org/10.1155/2022/6534238\nmethods,\
    \ of sophisticated technologies for the production of\ngood crops [2]. Intelligent\
    \ agriculture systems can supply\nfarmers with signiﬁcant environmental data from\
    \ their ﬁelds\nto enhance competitiveness and proﬁt. Nearly every area of\nagriculture\
    \ can beneﬁt from such technical developments,\nfrom plantation and irrigation\
    \ to plant protection and har-\nvesting. When the AI is integrated into the cloud,\
    \ processes\nbecome intelligible and judgments involving human involve-\nment\
    \ are made ﬂuently [3, 4]. Diverse strategies for resolving\ncontemporary issues\
    \ in agriculture have been presented,\nfrom databases to predictive analysis.\
    \ As far as precision\nand eﬃciency are concerned, systems using AI have proved\n\
    to be the best results [5]. Farming is a vibrant area, and the\ncircumstances\
    \ to deliver a meaningful solution cannot be\ngeneralized. The AI approaches enable\
    \ us to collect and\nrespond optimally to the unique challenge of the compli-\n\
    cated characteristics of each case. The development of vari-\nous\nAI\nsystems\n\
    gradually\nsolves\nextremely\ncomplex\nproblems. In agriculture, multiple approaches\
    \ to agriculture\nare adapted quickly to AI. The concept of smart systems\nenables\
    \ farmers to recognize crops, analyze the soil, provide\nexpert advice, and develop\
    \ business opportunities. This leads\nto stochastic AI technologies that enable\
    \ agricultural pro-\nduction to recognize, collect, and respond to diﬀerent condi-\n\
    tions (depending on the knowledge gained) to increase\neﬃciency [5, 6]. By following\
    \ new progress in the agricul-\ntural sector, farmers can oﬀer solutions via platforms\
    \ such\nas chatterbots that beneﬁt from the ﬁeld. Global agriculture\nartiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence is predicted to increase signiﬁcantly\n[7, 8]. It was aimed at\
    \ improving the eﬃciency of daily agri-\ncultural activities such as the adoption\
    \ of robots and drones,\nprotocols to monitor crop health, computerized irrigation\n\
    systems, and tractors without a driver. This paper was aimed\nat emphasizing the\
    \ usage of WSN and IoT in agriculture and\nat presenting an in-depth analysis\
    \ of sensor and IoT data\nanalytics utilizing AI approaches for applications in\
    \ agricul-\nture. The approach is to detect and control cotton leaf dis-\neases\n\
    and\nmotivate\nto\nincrease\nthe\napplication\nin\nagriculture-based application.\n\
    This paper organized as follows. Section 2 provides liter-\nature survey, and\
    \ Section 3 has presented the materials and\nmethods. Section 4 described the\
    \ artiﬁcial intelligence in\nagriculture. Section 5 proposed the novel approaches\
    \ and\nperformances. Section 6 discusses the analyzed result, and\nﬁnally, Section\
    \ 7 concluded the proposed work conclusion.\n2. Literature Survey\nArtiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ (AI) technologies have predicted the\nbehavior of nonlinear systems and have\
    \ contributed to con-\ntrolling variables to improve system-operating conditions.\
    \ A\nrecent analysis highlights the emergence of artiﬁcial intelli-\ngence as\
    \ part of solutions for enhanced farm productivity.\nSharma et al. [1] suggested\
    \ that solar-powered IoT sen-\nsor nodes monitor and operate the agricultural\
    \ sectors.\nOperations such as crop management, crop harvesting,\nwater supply\
    \ control, control of animals, distribution of pes-\nticide, moisture, and temperature\
    \ measuring technologies\nwill also be monitored and controlled in agriculture.\n\
    Suchithra [2] suggested that sensors can detect ﬁeld\nconditions such as temperature,\
    \ humidity, humidity, and\nfarm fertility. The value of sensing is authenticated\
    \ and\nthen transmitted to the Wi-Fi, and the veriﬁed data from\nthe Wi-Fi module\
    \ is transmitted via the cloud to the\nmobile or laptop of the farmer. If the\
    \ ﬁeld requires care,\nfarmers are also informed by SMS. An algorithm with\ntemperature,\
    \ humidity, and fertility thresholds is created\nthat can be conﬁgured to manage\
    \ water quantity in an\nMCU node. From anywhere in the world, farmers may\ncontrol\
    \ the engine.\nJoshi [3] described the construction of the wireless agri-\ncultural\
    \ environmental sensor nodes to monitor climatic\nconditions and deduct the optimum\
    \ external conditions for\nhigh crop yields in a speciﬁc agricultural ﬁeld. This\
    \ research\nfocuses on the literature on the construction of the wireless\nagricultural\
    \ environmental sensor nodes to monitor climatic\nconditions and deduct the optimum\
    \ external conditions for\nhigh crop yields in a speciﬁc agricultural ﬁeld. Agriculture\n\
    and food production is a sector that has recently remitted\nits concentration\
    \ to WSN, which seeks to raise its produc-\ntion and the agricultural yield benchmark\
    \ using these cost-\neﬀective modern technologies. In recent years, wireless sen-\n\
    sor networks (WSNs) have been attracting great attention.\nMekonnen [5] discussed\
    \ that the present analysis is a\ncomprehensive evaluation of the implementation\
    \ in sensor\ndata analytics within the agroecosystem of diﬀerent machine\nlearning\
    \ algorithms. It covers a case study on an integrated\nfood, energy, and water\
    \ (FEW) systems based on IoT-\ndriven smart farm prototypes.\nSangeeta et al.\
    \ [4] suggested that machine learning\napproach is intended to forecast the best\
    \ crop yield in a cer-\ntain area through the analysis of several climatic parameters,\n\
    such as precipitation, temperature, and dampness, soil pH,\nsoil type, and previous\
    \ plant crop records.\nGhadge [6] suggested that farmers monitor the soil\nfertility\
    \ based on data extraction analyses. The method,\ntherefore, focuses on the monitoring\
    \ of soil quality to\ndetermine the crop ﬁt for production by type of soil and\n\
    to maximize crop production using the right fertilizer\nrecommended.\nSujawat\
    \ [7] discussed that the enormous uses of artiﬁcial\nintelligence are in many\
    \ domains. Artiﬁcial intelligence can\nbe of tremendous help in addressing agricultural\
    \ illnesses\ndue to its ability to understand the problems and develop\nthe right\
    \ reasons for them and ﬁnd ideal solutions for them.\nThe study gives a quick\
    \ introduction of artiﬁcial intelligence\napplication in agriculture, its available\
    \ farming practices,\nand the numerous ways available to detect disease in plants.\n\
    Kshirsagar and Akojwar [8–11] elaborate on the use of\nartiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ for diﬀerent classiﬁcation and predic-\ntion problems and furthermore explained\
    \ the use of hybrid\nartiﬁcial intelligence for feature extraction, classiﬁcation,\n\
    and prediction along with modeling with diﬀerent algo-\nrithms and optimization\
    \ techniques. Signiﬁcant demonstra-\ntion in the domains of artiﬁcial intelligence,\
    \ case-based\nreasoning, multiagent optimization, scheduling, data min-\ning,\
    \ web crawlers, comprehending and translating natural\nlanguages, and virtual\
    \ vision reality [12–14].\n2\nWireless Communications and Mobile Computing\n3.\
    \ Materials and Methods\n3.1. Use of WSN in Agriculture. Spatial-temporal climatic,\n\
    hydrographic, pressure, movement, the wetness of the soil,\neco-psychological\
    \ plants, plagues, and the reporting to the\nfarmer of optimal alternatives are\
    \ possible using wireless sensor\nnetworks [9]. It would be a tremendous boon\
    \ for him to have\nsuch knowledge routinely. Automatic control equipment can\n\
    be used to control irrigation, fertilization, and pest control to\naddress adverse\
    \ situations which confront farmers. Mainte-\nnance of irrigation is also one\
    \ of the most crucial precise farm-\ning chores [5]. The small parasitoid wasp\
    \ Microplitis croceipes\nﬁnds caterpillars attacking cotton crops by placing onto\
    \ a com-\nplicated organic cocktail, which is issued when assaulted from\nthe\
    \ plant. Sensors capable of detecting this cocktail might result,\nwith much-targeted\
    \ pesticide treatments or warp introductions,\nin the early detection and mitigation\
    \ of this attack.\nDiverse elements, including soil type and temperature,\ndiﬀer\
    \ substantially in precision farming (PA) from area to\narea; any irrigation system\
    \ therefore must be ﬂexible to suit\nthese diﬀerences. Irrigation regulators are\
    \ frequently costly\nto manage precious water resources [10]. They are not eﬃ-\n\
    cient at all. Moreover, WSNs are still under improvement;\nfor instance, they\
    \ are sometimes inaccurate, delicate, and\nhungry for power and can easily lose\
    \ contact in a hostile\nenvironment, especially in agriculture [6]. Cultivation\
    \ ﬁeld\nsurveillance is critical for agricultural eﬀectiveness in reduc-\ning\
    \ resource waste and increasing yields in activities such as\nirrigation and fertilization\
    \ because it allows farmers to access\nand decide upon sound information on climate\
    \ factors, soil,\nand plant situations and changes in plant life [15]. Although\n\
    agricultural ﬁeld monitoring generally involves manpower,\none-oﬀ agro weather\
    \ stations, and wired sensor network sys-\ntems, the high density and ﬂexible\
    \ deployment of instru-\nments for collecting data in real time is necessary for\
    \ this\nissue, immersed in precise farming [11]. WSNs have been\ndeveloped to\
    \ provide low-cost, ﬂexible, easy-to-use, and\nhigh-precision beneﬁts in real\
    \ time for agricultural monitor-\ning. We highlight the applications for agriculture\
    \ and farm-\ning that can be used with WSNs [5, 6].\n3.1.1. Irrigation Management\
    \ System. Agricultural produc-\ntion demands a better irrigation system to maximize\
    \ water\nuse in agriculture. Another cause for the need for an\nimproved system\
    \ is the frightening decrease in the ground-\nwater level [16]. This setting has\
    \ a cost-eﬀective and water-\neﬃcient method of micro-irrigation. However, depending\n\
    on environmental and soil knowledge, microirrigation eﬃ-\nciency may be further\
    \ increased. WSNs are used as the orga-\nnizing mechanism in this respect.\n3.1.2.\
    \ Farming System Monitoring. Several upgraded technol-\nogies and equipment are\
    \ presently being employed in agricul-\nture. In this respect, the enhanced method\
    \ for managing this\nequipment makes operation generally easier and allows auto-\n\
    mation for famine. Furthermore, remote surveillance devices\naid better management\
    \ of large-scale farms [17]. Moreover,\nthe system quality can be enhanced by\
    \ providing extra data\nsuch as satellite photos and weather forecasts.\n3.1.3.\
    \ Pest and Disease Control. Increased quality of crops\nand minimized agricultural\
    \ expense are helped by controlled\nutilization of pesticides and fertilizers.\
    \ However, we must\nmonitor the likelihood and presence of pests in crops to con-\n\
    trol the use of pesticides [16]. We require information about\nthe environment,\
    \ such as temperature, moisture, and wind\nspeed, for this purpose. A WSN can\
    \ observe these occur-\nrences independently and can anticipate them in a ﬁeld\
    \ of\ninterest.\n3.1.4. Controlled Use of Fertilizers. The growth of plants and\n\
    their quality depends directly on fertilizer application. How-\never, it is demanding\
    \ work to optimally feed fertilizers in\ngood ﬁelds. Monitoring of the variation\
    \ in land nutrition\nsuch as nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), potassium (K), and\n\
    pH can be carried through the application of fertilizers for\nagriculture. The\
    \ balance of soil nutrition can therefore be\nsustained, as well as the quality\
    \ of the crop [18].\n3.1.5. Groundwater Quality Monitoring. The growing use of\n\
    fertilizers and pesticides reduces groundwater quality. Con-\ntrol of water quality\
    \ by placing sensor nodes is enhanced\nby wireless technology [3].\n3.1.6. Remote\
    \ Control and Diagnosis. Farm equipment like\npumps, lighting, heaters, and valves\
    \ in machines also can\nbe remotely controlled and diagnosed using the Internet\
    \ of\nThings [5].\n4. Artificial Intelligence in Agriculture\nIn its vigorous\
    \ technological discovery and the huge applica-\ntion region, artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ (AI) is one of the major\nresearch solutions in software development. AI’s key\
    \ idea\nin agriculture is ﬂexibility, fast performance, accuracy, and\ncost viability\
    \ [4, 19]. Artiﬁcial intelligence in agriculture\nnot only helps farmers utilize\
    \ their farming talents but also\nleads farmers to increase returns and improve\
    \ the quality\nwith less expense [7, 8]. AI-based technology for wireless\nsensors\
    \ enhances the eﬃcient functioning of all sectors and\naddresses the issues faced\
    \ by numerous sectors in the agri-\nculture industry such as crop harvesting,\
    \ irrigation, and soil\ncontent sensitivity. AI technology enables plant disease,\n\
    pests, and malnutrition diagnostics on farms, and AI sensors\ncan supervise the\
    \ agricultural parameters and control them\n[20, 21].\n5. Proposed System\nThe\
    \ system uses a temperature sensor, a humidity sensor,\nan optical sensor, a ground\
    \ moisture sensor, a soil pH sen-\nsor, and a camera module for data collection.\
    \ The ﬁeld\ncharacteristics are monitored using LCD monitors and\nmobile applications.\
    \ The sprayed chemical in the plants\nis controlled via the solenoid valve in\
    \ Figure 1. The ﬁrst\nimage is taken from the camera and detected and dis-\nplayed\
    \ in the app by image infection picked, when farmers\ntake the appropriate steps\
    \ after disease identiﬁcation, i.e.,\nby using an app to spray pesticides or fertilizers\
    \ to convert\nON/OFF into the water [22]. The ON/OFF external\n3\nWireless Communications\
    \ and Mobile Computing\ndevices are controlled by the relay driver. With the assis-\n\
    tance of a sensor, farmers may also control the soil and\nwater level in a tank.\
    \ For soil condition and water level\nand pesticide tank measurement, four diﬀerent\
    \ kinds of\nsensors are used. These sensors comprise a sensor [18], a\nhumidity\
    \ sensor, a sensor of water, and a humidity sensor.\nAll of these sensors have\
    \ a Raspberry Pi interface. For\nmoving the whole system, motor drivers and DC\
    \ motors\nare used. The movable system monitors the status of the\nground in diﬀerent\
    \ locations.\n5.1. IoT Cloud for the Proposed Method. To provide data\nand transport\
    \ the data between devices, this IoT cloud\nplays an essential function. The storage\
    \ is kept indepen-\ndently for every analysis, such as sensor output, item rec-\n\
    ognition, illnesses of plants, and predictive big data\nanalysis [3, 5, 7]. Moreover,\
    \ farmers can gain knowledge\nthrough Internet services from agroexperts about\
    \ smarter\nagriculture and future forecasting. Services are designed\nto provide\
    \ insights on crop planting, control of pesticides,\nand land management. In the\

    Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing\nconventional farmer may use these\
    \ services to prepare\nhimself. The server is powered by IoT devices and unbe-\n\
    lievably easy to operate.\n5.2. IoT Device and Sensors. This section comprises\
    \ several\nsensor types, cameras, display units, microscopic controllers,\nand\
    \ network components, like routers and switches. The sen-\nsors’ characteristics\
    \ are conditioned according to the predicted\nduties performed by actuators [6].\
    \ The central processing\nunit’s main focus is on the transmission of information\n\
    between components utilized to process IoT systems.\n5.3. Wi-Fi. In the proposed\
    \ system, wireless ﬁdelity plays a\ncrucial role in IoT deployment. A high-speed\
    \ Internet is\navailable via IEEE 802.11X to communicate with the user\n[16].\
    \ The built-in wireless network allows the robot to com-\nmunicate the gathered\
    \ data on the server and user interface\napplication via smart mobiles.\n5.4.\
    \ Smartphone. All data collected in the ﬁeld are used in the\nuser interface application\
    \ to appear on a mobile phone. It is\na mobile phone software program that designs\
    \ and works.\nThe application information in the ﬁeld is revealed [23].\n5.5.\
    \ Raspberry Pi. Raspberry Pi is a system for gathering data\nfrom numerous sensors.\
    \ The Raspberry PI GPIO pins con-\nnect diﬀerent sensors. When data is collected\

    \ and Mobile Computing\nby the Raspberry Pi over wireless networks, the data is\
    \ deliv-\nered to the database cloud [8, 9]. To forecast the output of\nplant\
    \ disease, the data collected from the cloud were previ-\nously processed and\
    \ analyzed by AI.\n5.6. HD Camera. Anything in the ﬁeld can be recorded and\n\
    provided to the user using a mobile app. The digital camera\nprovides the fundamental\
    \ ingredients for capturing images\nand videos [24].\n5.7. Sensor Unit. The plant’s\
    \ growth is mainly determined by\nthe elements of environment and climate and\
    \ the amount of\nwater and fertilizer irrigation. Fluid nutrition factors must\
    \ be\nmonitored and managed in a limited range of desired levels\nto ensure optimal\
    \ growth. The parameters shall include\nnutrient temperature, pH, and EC concentration\
    \ [3, 5]. If\nthe parameters exceed the acceptable range, plants can dam-\nage\
    \ it. Further parameters can be changed to improve fur-\nther growth, e.g., air\
    \ temperature, relative humidity, and\nlight intensity, and CO2 concentrations.\
    \ Some sensors are\nthe primary way to address challenges related to the moni-\n\
    toring and management of increasing spatial circumstances\n[6, 16]. The sensor\
    \ can detect and monitor a range of param-\neters such as temperature, moisture,\
    \ the intensity of light,\nand CO2. The following details are provided by its\
    \ function\nand operating process and the advantages that the key sen-\nsor oﬀers.\
    \ Image processing-based leaf disease detection is\nshown in [14]; this also analyzes\
    \ the CNN-based transfer\nlearning model.\n(i) Soil sensor: this sensor is used\
    \ to measure the\namount of soil moisture and water. Two huge\nexposing pads constitute\
    \ a sensor and work on the\nelectric conductivity key. Resistance of the soil\n\
    moisture sensor, which is the main determinant of\nplant development, is inversely\
    \ related to moisture\ncontent. If less than required water voltage is\nreduced,\
    \ analog voltage will enable the farmer to\ndiscover the water shortfall. This\
    \ sensor is utilized\nacross the ﬁeld to manage the quantity of water\nand any\
    \ other essential automation [17]. The water-\ning system in the greenhouse was\
    \ improved by the\nwireless moisture sensor network\n(ii) Light intensity sensor:\
    \ as we know, all plants and\nﬂowers require great sunshine, and every group of\n\
    plants reacts diﬀerently to the intensity of the light.\nSome plants work well\
    \ with low intensity of light\nand some with high intensity of light [16]. The\n\
    farmer must supply enough light quantities for the\nhealthy plant for at least\
    \ 8 to 10 hours per day. Arti-\nﬁcial lighting is a superior way to develop a\
    \ healthy\nplant with suﬃcient intensity [13]\n(iii) Temperature sensor: one of\
    \ the essential parameters\nregulating plant growth and development is temper-\n\
    ature. Lower temperatures are frequently the result\nof inadequate plant growth.\
    \ The photosynthesis\nand genotype growth demand a varied level of tem-\nperature,\
    \ which can advance plant growth [23]. The\noptimal temperature on the ground\
    \ should not be\nless than 4°C and more than 30°C for successful\nplant growth\n\
    (iv) Humidity sensor: the sensor is used for the sensa-\ntion and measurement\
    \ of comparative air humidity.\nThe real temperature of the air and humidity of\
    \ the\nTable 2: Analysis of time and chemical sprayed according to the\nnumber\

    \ 4: Data on soil moisture at speciﬁed intervals of the day.\n6\nWireless Communications\
    \ and Mobile Computing\nair is measured. Moisture aﬀects plant leaf growth,\n\
    pollination, and photosynthesis directly and indi-\nrectly in many ways. The health\
    \ of the leaf does\nnot depend only on photosynthesis but also on the\nphysical\
    \ cell development process that may be\nobserved using a moisture sensor [13]\n\
    (v) CO2 sensor: to maintain the root metabolism in the\nnutritional solution,\
    \ the necessary levels of oxygen\nin the root environment are vital. The level\
    \ of oxy-\ngen in the root environment is particularly signiﬁ-\ncant since low\
    \ levels inﬂuence the breathing of the\nroot, its nutrient absorption, and thus\
    \ plant growth\n(vi) pH sensor: the pH sensor is used to accurately mon-\nitor\
    \ the number of nutrients needed to be irrigated\nin the soil. The pH value is\
    \ monitored to supply\nthe plants or crops with the needed amount of\nnutrients\
    \ for healthy growth [18, 23]\n5.8. Motor Driver. The DC motor that is attached\
    \ to the\nwheels is utilized to drive the driver. It is a current ampliﬁer\nthat\
    \ regulates the motor power and converts a low-power\nsignal into a high-powered\
    \ motor signal and vice versa [20].\n5.9. DC Motor. The DC engine is an electric\
    \ machine that\ntransforms electrical power into mechanical energy. The\nmain\
    \ components of the DC engine are the current-\ncarrying frame [21] connected\
    \ to the supply by the switch\nand contacts. It works on the basis that “the current-\n\
    carrying driver in the magnetic ﬁeld has mechanical force.”\n5.10. Robot Movement.\
    \ DC motors are utilized for robot\nmovements that are electronically regulated\
    \ by the Rasp-\nberry Pi. The wireless module takes signals from the input\nand\
    \ transmits them to the processor, which turns the engine\naround. DC engines\
    \ are switched on and oﬀ when the signal\nis received by permitting a certain\
    \ pin for the Raspberry Pi\n[15, 24]. An adequate velocity is provided by 300\
    \ rpm DC\nmotors.\n5.11. Pesticide Spraying Mechanism. The Raspberry Pi digital\n\
    key’s Wi-Fi module connection receives a message from the\nmobile app on a smartphone.\
    \ The drifting sensor and sub-\nmersible pump have been placed in the pesticides.\
    \ The pump\nis connected on one end of the tube and the other end with\nthe sprayer\
    \ nozzle [25]. The user can use the mobile applica-\ntion to spray a speciﬁed\
    \ pesticide if the plant suﬀers from\nany illness.\n5.12. Data Acquisition. In\
    \ the data acquisition segment, the\ndata acquisition unit is established in various\
    \ sensor nodes.\nThe data collection module is used in agricultural produc-\n\
    tion to collect information from processing variables in real\ntime (temperature,\
    \ light intensity, humidity, nutritional\nproduct solution level, atomization\
    \ quantities, and photos\nof plants and sick plants). Finally, the control and\
    \ manage-\nment sector is a central processing unit of the system\n(CPU). The\
    \ CPU system includes various critical duties\nincluding Raspberry Pi and WRTnod,\
    \ which are designed\nfor the storage, management [5, 6, 8], and transfer of data\n\
    acquired from nodes to the webserver in real time. This tech-\nnology allows farmers\
    \ to monitor and control the operation\nremotely through the smartphone app.\n\
    5.13. Image Preprocessing. Image preprocessing uses various\npreprocessing techniques\
    \ to eliminate image noise or\nanother removal of objects. The pixel size of the\
    \ original\nimage is large, and it takes more time for the whole proce-\ndure\
    \ [9, 12]. After the image has been converted into mini-\natures, the pixel size\
    \ is decreasing and it takes less time.\n5.14. Image Segmentation. Image segmentation\
    \ is one of the\nmost commonly used ways for clearly distinguishing image\npixels\
    \ in a speciﬁc application [20]. It divides an image into\nseveral discrete states,\
    \ which show a large similarity of the\npixels in each area.\n5.15. Feature Extraction.\
    \ Feature extraction is a key element\nin the detection of disease. In the identiﬁcation\
    \ of an object,\nit plays a vital function. The extraction of features is used\
    \ in\nnumerous image processing applications [22, 26]. The fea-\ntures used for\
    \ the detection of illness are color, texture edges,\nand morphology.\n5.16. Classiﬁcation.\
    \ This is the last phase in the identiﬁcation\nof disease in which the classiﬁcation\
    \ system is utilized to rec-\nognize the type of leaf disease [27]. Diﬀerent types\
    \ of artiﬁ-\ncial intelligence are used for detecting leaf diseases.\n5.16.1.\
    \ Random Forest. Bagging is a new model of random\nforestry based on trees. Bagging\
    \ was aimed at minimizing\nprediction variation by averaging predictions via sampling\n\
    and substitution. Random forests supply the packing with\na new element, randomly\
    \ selecting and producing a tree with\ncharacteristic alterations and often repeating\
    \ [11, 28]; this\nprocedure ultimately measuring all forecasts is made\nTable\

    \ and Mobile Computing\navailable by all the trees. Therefore, the random forest\
    \ han-\ndles and is powerful both in terms of bias and variance.\n5.16.2. Naive\
    \ Bayes. This classiﬁer has diﬀerent dynamic fea-\ntures. Although, classiﬁcations\
    \ predict certain connections\nbetween the features and their class of the Naive\
    \ Bayes\nmodel. This reduces the data, although Naive Bayes uses\nadvanced ways\
    \ to improve eﬃciency and receive some the-\nory [21, 28]. Naive Bayes classiﬁcation\
    \ has many high-\ndimensional features with very little data training and is\n\
    highly scalable.\nIn Bayesian analysis, the probability of an event C given\n\
    an event Y is not the same as the probability of Y given C as\nin Eq (1).\nP C\

    \ of the crop prediction dataset, respectively,\nthe Bayes equation can be expressed\
    \ as shown in Eq (2).\nWhere PðCÞ = prior probability representing the feature\n\
    vectors of crop dataset.\nPðC ∣ ZÞ = prior probability representing the class\
    \ of\ncrop dataset.\n5.16.3. Support Vector Machine (SVM). Algorithms for SVM\n\
    regression are modiﬁed to predict continued response. SVM\nregression algorithms\
    \ instead of identifying hyperplanes that\nseparate data ﬁnd a model that does\
    \ not diﬀer by value from\nthe measured data except for a small number of parameter\n\
    values that reduce error sensitivity. It is suitable for large-\nscale data when\
    \ there are a large number of predictor factors.\nPotential applications of SVM-aided\
    \ PA [26] in WSN are a\nregression for the detection and forecast of plant disease\n\
    and sensor data [28].\nThe SVM is a multitude of instances chosen as space\npoints\
    \ so that samples belonging to distinct groups are\ndivided into two groups.\n\
    The input characteristics are transferred to a higher-\ndimensional space and\
    \ can also be shown as Eq (3).\nWhere the set of nonlinear transformation and\
    \ k is the\nbias.\nFigure 2 is a ﬂow chart where the robot will operate in\nthe\
    \ initial phase, detection of soil type (soil color). It will\nexamine which sort\
    \ of crop has been sown after the detec-\ntion of the soil. It checks the health\
    \ of the crop and the soil\nbased on crops. If soil fertilization and cultivation\
    \ are not\ntroublesome, then these operations are carried out. If the\nplant and\
    \ soil are troublesome, the problem is resolved and\nthe farmer is encouraged\
    \ to take the required measures for\nthe crop, and chemical is sprayed on the\
    \ infected plants\nand monitored for a few days. If the problem ends, the issue\n\
    will be checked again. If no diﬃculty is present and the ill-\nness of the crop\
    \ is cleared, the robot will not function till\nthe next disease is detected.\n\
    5.17. Performance Measurement. The statistical analysis, and\nin particular the\
    \ average square error (MSE), is used to\ndetermine the durability of established\
    \ models to prevent\nplant illness [15, 24]. However, precise, speciﬁc, sensitive,\n\
    accurate, and F-score assessment matrices were used to eval-\nuate the classiﬁcation\
    \ model that has been created. Table 1\nspeciﬁed the employed model measures.\n\
    6. Results And Discussion\nIt takes at least 15 seconds to spray chemical products\
    \ on\neach plant. After 3 seconds, he continued his trip to the rest\nof the plants.\
    \ A total length of roughly 33.36 minutes was\nneeded for a maximum of 75 plants\
    \ with a total length of\n20 centimeters. This will have a consumption of 30,000\
    \ mil-\nliliters of chemicals, as shown in Table 2 and Figure 3.\n6.1. Data on\

    \ between sensors and Rasp-\nberry Pi and wireless communication. The detection\
    \ of leaf\ndisease is carried out with artiﬁcial intelligence. All observa-\n\
    tions and tests have been performed, which demonstrates\nthat this is the intelligent\
    \ agriculture solution as indicated\nin Table 4. This approach enhances the agricultural\
    \ output\nand boosts the farmers’ total income.\nThe main objective of the paper,\
    \ as described above, is to\ndetect and control cotton leaf diseases. The dataset\
    \ was sep-\narated into 60% training and 40% test subsets to validate the\nproposed\
    \ model. For predicting the leaf diseases, RF, SVM,\nand Naive Bayes were used.\
    \ The results of the various AI\nclassiﬁcation models are given in Table 5. Leaf\
    \ disease detec-\ntion using various algorithms is shown in Figures 5–7.\n7. Conclusion\
    \ and Future Scope\nAgriculture is undergoing a digital transition, like numerous\n\
    industries. The amount of data from farms is collected.\nWireless, IoT, robotic,\
    \ and AI networks are being used.\nArtiﬁcial intelligence algorithms enable the\
    \ extraction from\nthe ﬂood of data of relevant knowledge and insight. The\nmajor\
    \ purpose of this work is, according to the discussion,\nto detect and monitor\
    \ cotton leaf diseases. The second\nobjective is to monitor the parameters of\
    \ agricultural\nparameters. The correct identiﬁcation and illness of the\nplants\
    \ are extremely crucial for agricultural performance,\nand this may be done with\
    \ artiﬁcial intelligence. This\npaper analyzes the approach of AI for the detection\

  explanation: The paper is about providing user-friendly interfaces (e.g., mobile
    apps, web dashboards) for farmers to input preferences, constraints, and expert
    knowledge into automated irrigation systems, using techniques like participatory
    design or user-centered design. For example, farmers can input the type of crop
    they're growing, the soil type, and the local climate conditions. The irrigation
    system can then use this information to automatically adjust the watering schedule
    to optimize crop yields. This reduces the need for farmers to manually manage
    the irrigation system and can lead to increased productivity and water savings.

    approach and148 articles are selected and critically analyzed. • The results show
    the extent of digital technologies adoption in agriculture. • The potential benefits
    of digital technologies and roadblocks hindering their implementation in agriculture
    sector are identified and discussed. • The study will positively impact the research
    around agriculture 4.0. Abstract Agriculture is considered one of the most important
    sectors that play a strategic role in ensuring food security. However, with the
    increasing world''s population, agri-food demands are growing — posing the need
    to switch from traditional agricultural methods to smart agriculture practices,
    also known as agriculture 4.0. To fully benefit from the potential of agriculture
    4.0, it is significant to understand and address the problems and challenges associated
    with it. This study, therefore, aims to contribute to the development of agriculture
    4.0 by investigating the emerging trends of digital technologies in the agricultural
    industry. For this purpose, a systematic literature review based on Protocol of
    Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses is conducted
    to analyse the scientific literature related to crop farming published in the
    last decade. After applying the protocol, 148 papers were selected and the extent
    of digital technologies adoption in agriculture was examined in the context of
    service type, technology readiness level, and farm type. The results have shown
    that digital technologies such as autonomous robotic systems, internet of things,
    and machine learning are significantly explored and open-air farms are frequently
    considered in research studies (69%), contrary to indoor farms (31%). Moreover,
    it is observed that most use cases are still in the prototypical phase. Finally,
    potential roadblocks to the digitization of the agriculture sector were identified
    and classified at technical and socio-economic levels. This comprehensive review
    results in providing useful information on the current status of digital technologies
    in agriculture along with prospective future opportunities. Previous article in

    problem Food security is a multidimensional concept that alleviates hunger by
    ensuring a sustainable, nutritious food supply. It is characterized by a four-pillar
    model shown in Fig. 1, with each pillar intrinsic to ensure food security [1].

    full-size image Fig. 2. Agriculture value chain: stages and main functions. Due
    to several anthropogenic factors, such as rapid population growth, urbanization,
    industrialization, farmland loss, freshwater scarcity, and environmental degradation,
    food security is becoming a serious global issue. This is because these factors
    are also directly impacting agricultural industry which is a primary source of
    agri-food production around the world. It is anticipated that by 2050 global population
    will be increased from the current 7.7 billion to 9.2 billion, urban population
    will be rise by 66%, arable land will be declined by approximately 50 million
    hectares, global GHG emissions (source of CO2 – promote crop disease and pest
    growth) will be increased by 50%, agri-food production will be declined by 20%,
    and eventually, food demand will be increased by 59 to 98% – posing an imminent
    threat to food security and adequate food availability [2], [3], [4]. To satisfy
    the increasing food demands, agricultural practitioners worldwide will need to
    maximise the agricultural productivity involving crop and livestock farming. In
    this review paper, the focus is on crop farming that involves cultivation of both
    food and cash crops. A typical agri-food value chain depicting three primary stages,
    namely pre-field (pre-plantation stage), in-field (plantation and harvesting stage),
    and post-field (post-harvesting stage) involved in the production of agricultural
    products is shown in Fig. 2. All the stages play a vital role in the value chain
    but, in this review, the second stage ˝in-field˝ will be considered that involves
    several crop growing processes such as plowing, sowing, spraying, and harvesting,
    etc. These processes currently employ traditional agricultural practices that
    are labor-intensive, require arable land, time, and a substantial amount of water
    (for irrigation) – making it a challenge to produce enough agri-food [5]. A part
    of problem is also related to irregular use of pesticides and herbicides and misuse
    of available technology which cause harm to crop and eventually resulting in agricultural
    wastes [6]. These issues can be addressed by integrating sophisticated technologies
    and computer-based applications that ensure high crop yield, less water consumption,
    optimised pesticide/herbicide utilization, and enhanced crop quality. This is
    where the smart agriculture concept comes in. 1.2. Smart agriculture Industry
    4.0, also known as the fourth industrial revolution, is revolutionizing, and reshaping
    every industry. It is a strategic initiative characterized by a fusion of emerging
    disruptive digital technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), big data and
    analytics (BDA), system integration (SI), cloud computing (CC), simulation, autonomous
    robotic systems (ARS), augmented reality (AR), artificial intelligence (AI), wireless
    sensor networks (WSN), cyber-physical system (CPS), digital twin (DT), and additive
    manufacturing (AM) to enable the digitization of the industry [7]. The integration
    of these technologies in agriculture is sparking the next generation industrial
    agriculture, namely, agriculture 4.0 – also termed smart agriculture, smart farming,
    or digital farming [7]. Smart agriculture provides farmers with a diverse set
    of tools (shown in Fig. 3) to address several agricultural food production challenges
    associated with farm productivity, environmental impact, food security, crop losses,
    and sustainability. For instance, with IoT-enabled systems consisting of WSNs,
    farmers can connect to farms remotely irrespective of place and time to monitor
    and control farm operations. Drones equipped with hyperspectral cameras can be
    used to collect data from heterogeneous sources on farmlands and autonomous robots
    can be used to support or accomplish repetitive tasks at farms. Data analytics
    techniques can be employed to analyze the gathered data with computer applications
    can be used to assist farmers in decision-making process. Likewise, a wide variety
    of parameters related to environmental factors, weed control, crop production
    status, water management, soil conditions, irrigation scheduling, herbicides,
    and pesticides, and controlled environment agriculture can be monitored and analyzed
    in smart agriculture to increase crop yields, minimize costs, enhance product
    quality, and maintain process inputs through the use of modern systems [8]. Download

    The concept of “Smart Agriculture”. 1.3. Research motivation and contribution
    The motivation for preparing this review stems from the fact that digital technologies
    in agricultural systems offer new strategic solutions for enhancing the efficiency
    and effectiveness of farms’ production. Moreover, digital transformation provides
    a way forward to implement modern farming practices such as vertical farming (hydroponics,
    aquaponics and aeroponics), which has the potential to overcome food security
    problems. But there is a set of problems and limitations associated with this
    transformation from the technical, socio-economic, and management standpoint that
    must be death to fully exploit the potential of agriculture 4.0 [9]. There are
    number of studies that have discussed emerging trends in the development of agriculture
    4.0 by providing succinct information on key applications, advantages, and corresponding
    research challenges of smart farming [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15],
    [16], [17], [18]. The research focus of these studies is limited to either explaining
    more generic technical aspects while paying attention to only one or few digital
    technologies, and/or enhancing agricultural supply chain performance, and/or developing
    agriculture 4.0 definition, and/or achieving sustainable agronomy through precision
    agriculture, and/or proposing a smart farming framework. Nevertheless, these studies
    do not involve explicit discussion on the tools and techniques used to develop
    different systems and maturity level of these systems. There is also a lack of
    studies considering modern soilless farms such as hydroponics, aquaponics and
    aeroponics (indoor/outdoor) and implications of digital technologies in these
    farms. Hence, it is necessary to analyse the evolution of agriculture 4.0 from
    different perspectives to stimulate the discussion in the area. This study aims
    to present a holistic overview of digital technologies implemented in second stage
    of agricultural production value chain (in-field) for different types of farms
    as mentioned in section 1.1. The main theoretical contribution of the study involves
    analysis and dissemination of the tools and techniques employed, the farm type,
    the maturity level of the developed systems, along with potential roadblocks or
    inhibiting factors in development of agriculture 4.0. The reflections presented
    in the review will support researchers and agricultural practitioner in future
    research on agriculture 4.0. 1.4. Paper organization Following the introduction,
    the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses the approach used to gather
    the relevant literature; then, Section 3 presents the statistical results obtained
    after a general analysis of the selected research studies; next, Section 4 provides
    a detailed overview of the core technologies used in the digitization of agriculture;
    after, Section 5 highlights the technical and socio-economic roadblocks to digital
    integration in agriculture; next, Section 6 outlines a discussion about the research
    questions followed by added value, considerations and future prospects related
    to agricultural digitization, and transition to agriculture 5.0; and lastly, Section
    8 concludes the review. 2. Research methodology A systematic literature review
    (SLR) is a tool used to manage the diverse knowledge and identify research related
    to a predetermined topic [19]. In this study, SLR is conducted to investigate
    the status of Industry 4.0 technologies in agricultural industry. Particularly,
    cases are searched where the term ‘agriculture’ appeared concurrently in the title,
    abstract, or keywords of an article with any of the ‘Industry 4.0 technologies”
    mentioned in section 1.2. Before conducting the SLR, a review protocol is defined
    to ensure a transparent and high-quality research process, which are the characteristics
    that make a literature review systematic [20]. The review protocol also helps
    to minimize bias by conducting exhaustive literature searches. This includes three
    steps: the formulation of the research questions, the definition of the search
    strategy, and the specification of inclusion and exclusion criteria. This paper
    uses a preferred reporting item for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA)
    approach to conduct SLR. PRISMA is an evidence-based minimum set of items that
    are used to guide the development process of systematic literature reviews and
    other meta-analyses [19]. 2.1. Review protocol A review protocol (in Table 1)
    is defined before conducting the bibliographic analysis to identify, evaluate,
    and interpret results relevant to the research scope. First, research questions
    are formulated to provide insight into the analysis of published studies in the
    research area of interest from different dimensions. These questions need to be
    answered in the study. Next, the search strategy is defined, which helps identify
    appropriate keywords later in the search equation to identify the relevant information
    sources, such as academic databases and search engines that provide access to
    a massive amount of digital documentation. Three online research repositories
    are used to retrieve relevant studies: ScienceDirect1, Scopus2, and IEEE Xplore3.
    Finally, to refine the search results of each database, boundaries are set by
    predefining inclusion and exclusion criteria for further investigation and content
    assessments of selected publications. It involves, for instance, defining the
    time interval for the research process from 2011 to 2021 to limit the studies
    to those published in English, disregarding chapters of books and grey literature,
    such as reports and summaries of events and seminars. These last two steps of
    the review protocol allow the preliminary filtering of metadata sources and narrow
    down the scope of research. Table 1. Review protocol for systematic literature
    review. Review questions RQ1: Which Industry 4.0 technologies have been used in
    the literature for digitization of agriculture? RQ2: How and to what extent have
    these technologies been applied in the context of service type, tools and techniques

    search process is done in four stages: identification, screening, eligibility,
    and inclusion, as detailed by the PRISMA flow diagram shown in Fig. 4. After initial
    metadata filtering through the application of search expression, a total of 3165
    records are found (1690 from Scopus, 926 from ScienceDirect, and 549 from IEEE
    Xplore), which are then consolidated for the removal of duplicate items in the
    identification stage. The number of publications after this step is reduced to
    2876. In the screening stage, the titles and abstracts of the papers are analyzed,
    and only 498 papers are selected for integral reading. In the third stage, full-text
    screening of these articles is performed to verify their eligibility in relation
    to the objective of this paper, which is to answer the research questions mentioned
    in Table 1. Of the 498 papers, 137 are found to be relevant for this review. Another
    11 are added through a cross-referencing approach, adding up to 148 papers selected
    in the final stage for further analysis. Download : Download high-res image (624KB)

    SLR is susceptible to threats to validity because the current search is limited

    if additional sources were explored. The process of SLR is described clearly in
    sub-sections 2.1 and 2.2, and hence, validity can be considered well addressed.
    However, in the case of replication of this SLR, it is possible that one can find
    slightly different publications. This difference would result from different personal
    choices during the screening and eligibility steps of PRISMA, but it is highly
    unlikely that the overall findings would change. ii Search string: the search

    is a possibility that valuable studies might have been missed. Additional keywords
    and synonyms with a broader search might return more studies. 3. Digitization
    trends in agriculture The year-wise distribution of the 148 articles from 2011
    to 2021 is represented in Fig. 5. Around 22% of the scientific publications in
    the last ten years were published in 2018. This reflects that the agricultural
    industry is making considerable progress in the context of the implementation
    of digital technologies, but the pace is still slow as compared to other domains
    such as healthcare, manufacturing, mining, automotive, energy, etc.,[15]. Download

    of the 148 selected research studies. The farm type refers to the crop farming
    method considered while developing an application or framework. For instance,
    the farming method can be soil-based or soilless. The soil-based farming category
    involves open-air fields (traditional outdoor agricultural farms) and greenhouse
    farms (indoor). On the other hand, the soilless farming category involves modern
    farming practices such as aquaponics, aeroponics, and hydroponics (mostly indoor).
    The numbers at the top of the stacked column in Fig. 6 indicate the total number
    of studies that have used the particular technology to develop a smart agriculture
    system, whereas different colors of columns indicate the respective farm types.
    Use cases are from these publications are analysed, and conclusions are drawn.
    For instance, it is found that autonomous robotics systems (including unmanned
    guided vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles (drones)), internet of things, and
    machine learning appear to be the widely applied technologies in the agricultural
    domain in the last decade. The same illustration suggests that big data, wireless
    sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and digital twins are the emerging areas
    in agriculture. Moreover, open-air farms are the most frequently considered in
    research studies (69%), contrary to indoor farms (31%). For soilless farming systems
    (aquaponics, aeroponics, and hydroponics), only 22 publications are found, which
    insinuates that these modern farming practices are still in their infancy. Likewise,
    services of each use case are identified and are classified under nine different
    service categories, namely: i) crop management, CM (Estimation/ prediction of
    crop yield/ growth rate/ harvesting period and seed plantation/ harvesting/ pollination/
    spraying (fertilizer/ pesticide)); ii) crop quality management, CQM (fresh weight,
    green biomass, height, length, width, leaf density, piment content (chlorophyll)
    and phytochemical composition); iii) water and environment management, WEM (monitoring
    and control of flow rate, water level, water quality (nutrients), temperature,
    humidity, CO2, and weather forecast etc.); iv) irrigation management, IM (water
    stress detection and scheduling); v) farm management, FM (monitoring of farm operations,
    tracking and counting products, determining production efficiency, financial analysis,
    energy consumption analysis, technology integration and decisions implementation);
    vi) pest and disease management, PDM (pest identification and disease detection);
    vii) soil management, SM (moisture content, soil nutrients, fertilizer needs and
    application); viii) weed and unwanted vegetation management, WUVM (weed/unknown
    vegetation mapping, classification, and herbicides application); and ix) fruit
    detection and counting, FDC — as shown in Fig. 7. These categories illustrate
    the role of different digital technologies in smart farming. Upon analysis, it
    is found that crop management parameters, such as crop yield prediction, growth
    rate estimation, or evaluation of harvesting period are the most frequently researched
    areas for agriculture 4.0 in the last decade (29%), whereas very little heed is
    paid towards soil management (2%), fruit detection and counting (2%), and crop
    quality management (3%). Download : Download high-res image (561KB) Download :

    TRL 1–2 (use case is in conceptual phase), the second level is the prototype,
    which means European TRL 3–6 (use case is working even without the complete planned
    functionality), and the third level is deployed, that includes European TRL 7–9
    (use case is mature with all the possible functions). Fig. 8 depicts the TRL of
    each use case developed in selected studies. It is observed that little progress
    has been made in advancing smart agricultural systems beyond the concept and prototype
    levels to the commercial level. For instance, most use cases (129) are at the
    prototype level. Download : Download high-res image (269KB) Download : Download

    provides critical insights towards answering RQ1 and RQ2 from Table 1. 4.1. Internet
    of Things driven agricultural systems Internet of things (IoT) refers to a cosmos
    of interrelated computing devices, sensors, appliances, and machines connected
    with the internet, each having unique identities and capabilities for performing
    remote sensing and monitoring [21]. The reference architecture of IoT with six
    layers, namely perception layer (hardware devices), network layer (communication),
    middleware layer (device management and interoperability), service layer (cloud
    computing), application layer (data integration and analytics), and end-user layer
    (user-interface), is shown in Fig.9. In the agricultural domain, IoT devices in
    the physical layer gather data related to environmental and crop parameters such
    as temperature, humidity, pH value, water level, leaf color, fresh leaf weight,
    etc. The transmission of this data takes place in the network layer, the design
    of which depends on the selection of suitable communication technologies relevant
    to the field size, farm location, and type of farming method. For instance, ZigBee,
    LoRa, and Sigfox are widely used and employed in outdoor fields because they are
    cheaper and have low energy consumption and a good transmission range [22,23].
    Despite being a secure technology, Bluetooth is only used in indoor farms as it
    offers a short transmission range [22]. Wi-Fi is not a promising technology for
    agricultural applications due to its high costs and high energy consumption [22].
    RFID (radio frequency identification) and NFC (near field communication) technologies,
    on the other hand, are increasingly being implemented in agricultural systems
    for tracking agricultural products [24]. GPRS or mobile communication technology
    (2G, 3G, and 4G) are used for periodic monitoring of environmental and soil parameters.
    In addition, communication protocols mostly used in the agricultural scenarios
    are HTTP, WWW, and SMTP. Likewise, to ensure interoperability and system security
    to their context-aware functionalities, middleware HYDRA and SMEPP are mostly
    employed in agricultural systems [25]. To store data, cloud computing techniques
    are employed in the service layer. This data is then used in the application layer
    to build smart applications used by farmers, agriculture experts, and supply chain
    professionals to enhance farm monitoring capacity and productivity. Download :

    architecture of Internet of Things (IoT), (adapted) [26]. The integration of IoT
    in agriculture is meant to empower farmers with the decision tools and automation
    technologies that seamlessly integrate knowledge, products, and services to achieve
    high productivity, quality, and profit. A multitude of studies is performed and
    put forward concerning the incubation of the IoT concepts in the agricultural
    sector. The main findings of some of the studies are presented in Table 2. Multiple
    technological issues and architectural problems have been addressed through the
    development of IoT-based agricultural systems. But most of these systems are either
    in a conceptual stage or in a prototype form (not commercial) at the moment. Focus
    is mainly laid on-farm management, irrigation control, crop growth, health monitoring,
    and disease detection. Some of these studies have also explained IoT implementation
    in modern agricultural systems such as vertical farming (soilless farming - aquaponics,
    hydroponics, and aeroponics) and greenhouse farming (soil-based). Moreover, most
    studies have focused on addressing a specific problem. Table 2. IoT-driven agricultural

    networks in agriculture Wireless sensor network (WSN) is regarded as a technology
    that is used within an IoT system. It can be defined as a group of spatially distributed
    sensors for monitoring the physical conditions of the environment, temporarily
    storing the collected data, and transmitting the gathered information at a central
    location [22]. The general architecture of WSN is shown in Fig. 10. A WSN for
    smart farming is made up of numerous sensor nodes connected through a wireless
    connection module. These nodes have a variety of abilities (e.g., processing,
    transmission, and sensation) that allow them to self-organize, self-configure,
    and self-diagnose. There are different types of WSNs, which are categorized depending
    on the environment where they are deployed. These include terrestrial wireless
    sensor networks (TWSNs), wireless underground sensor networks (WUSNs), underwater
    wireless sensor networks (UWSNs), wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSNs),
    and mobile wireless sensor networks (MWSNs) [55]. In agricultural applications,
    TWSN and UWSN are widely used. In TWSNs, the nodes are deployed above the ground
    surface, consisting of sensors for gathering the surrounding data. The second
    variant of WSNs is its underground counterpart – WUSNs, where sensor nodes are
    planted inside the soil. In this setting, lower frequencies easily penetrate through
    the soil, whereas higher frequencies suffer severe attenuation [56]. Therefore,
    the network requires a higher number of nodes to cover a large area because of
    the limited communication radius. Many research articles are available in the
    literature that discusses the use of WSN for different outdoor and indoor farms’
    applications such as irrigation management, water quality assessment, and environmental
    monitoring. A summary of some of these articles is given in Table 3. These studies
    have focused on developing WSNs architectures that are simplified, low cost, energy-efficient
    and scalable. Yet, various factors associated with WSNs need further attention,
    such as minimum maintenance, robust and fault-tolerant architecture, and interoperability.

    [66] 4.3. Cloud computing in agriculture According to the National Institute of
    Standard and Technologies (NIST), cloud computing (CC) is defined as a model for
    enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of
    configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications,
    and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management
    effort or service provider interaction [67]. The main architecture of CC shown
    in Fig. 11 is comprised of four layers: datacenter (hardware), infrastructure,
    platform, and application [68]. Each of these layers is linked with specific cloud
    service models, which are classified as software as a service (SaaS), platform
    as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a service (IaaS). Cloud computing has
    gained great attention over the past decade in the agriculture sector because
    it provides: 1) inexpensive storage services for data gathered from different
    domains through WSNs and other preconfigured IoT devices, 2) large-scale computing
    systems to perform intelligent decision-making by transforming this raw data into
    useful knowledge, and 3) a secure platform to develop agricultural IoT applications
    [69]. In combination with IoT and WSN, CC is employed to develop different agricultural
    applications, most of which are presented in Tables 2 and 3. CC technology is
    also used to create operational farm management systems (FMSs) to support farmers
    and farm managers in efficient monitoring of farm operations Table 4. presents
    the salient features of some of these FMSs. Another topic of interest that is
    being explored in global research is related to the traceability of agri-product
    quality [70]. But only preliminary research has been attempted to explore traceability
    compliance with standards of food safety and quality. Download : Download high-res

    systems have the potential to solve problems of increasing food demands, environmental
    pollution caused by excessive use of pesticides and fertilizers, and the safety
    of agricultural products. These FMSs, however, do not have the capability to support
    run-time customization in relation to distinct requirements of farmers. Moreover,
    because most farm data is usually fragmented and dispersed, it is difficult to
    record farm activities properly in current FMSs applications [75]. 4.4. Edge/fog
    computing in agriculture The rapid development of IoT has led to the explosive
    growth of sensors and smart devices, generating large volumes of data. The processing
    and analysis of such an enormous amount of data in real-time are challenging because
    it increases the load on the cloud server and also reduces the response speed.
    Simply using a cloud server is not able to provide real-time response while handling
    such a large data set. Additionally, IoT applications are sensitive to network
    latency because they require a constant exchange of information between devices
    and the cloud, making CC unfeasible to handle these applications [23]. The emergence
    of the edge computing concept can resolve the problems associated with CC. This
    new computing model deploys computing and storage resources (such as cloudlets
    or fog nodes) at the edge of the network closer to data sources such as mobile
    devices or sensors. This way, it can facilitate real-time analytics while keeping
    data secure on the device [23]. Edge computing offers intriguing possibilities
    for smart agriculture, but the applications of this technology are only in their
    infancy in agricultural systems. Hence, few research studies are available in
    this area; see Table 5. Most of the edge computing-based agricultural systems
    discussed in these studies are prototypical and address a limited selection of
    problems in various agricultural domains. So far, interoperability and scalability
    issues have not received sufficient consideration. Table 5. Edge computing-based

    robot systems in agriculture Autonomous robot systems (ARS) are intelligent machines
    capable of performing tasks, making decisions, and acting in real-time, with a
    high degree of autonomy (without external influence or without explicit human
    intervention) [83]. Interest in agricultural ARS (AARS) has grown significantly
    in recent years because of their ability to automate some practices in outdoor
    and indoor farms - including seeding, watering, fertilizing, spraying, plant monitoring
    and phenotyping, environmental monitoring, disease detection, weed and pest controlling,
    and harvesting [15]. The agricultural robots use a combination of emerging technologies
    such as computer vision, WSNs, satellite navigation systems (GPS), AI, CC, and
    IoT, thereby facilitating the farmers to enhance productivity and quality of agricultural
    products. AARS in smart farming can be mobile AARS, which can move throughout
    the working field, or fixed AARS [84]. Mobile AARSs are further classified into
    unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) and 2) unnamed aerial vehicles (UAVs), which are
    explained in the following sections. 4.5.1. Unmanned ground vehicles in agriculture
    Unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) are agricultural robots that operate on the ground
    without a human operator. The main components of UGVs generally include; a platform
    for locomotive apparatus and manipulator, sensors for navigation, a supervisory
    control system, an interface for the control system, the communication links for
    information exchange between devices, and a system architecture for integration
    between hardware and software agents [85]. The control architecture of UGV can
    be remote-operated (controlled by a human operator via the interface) or fully
    autonomous (operated without the need for a human controller based on artificial
    intelligence technologies) [85]. Likewise, locomotive systems can be based on
    wheels, tracks, or legs [85]. Despite high ground adaptability, intrinsic omnidirectionality
    and soil protection of legged robots, they are uncommon in agriculture. However,
    when combined with wheels (wheel-legged robots), these robots offer a disruptive
    locomotion system for smart farms. In addition to their needed characteristics
    for infield operations, UGV should fulfill certain requirements such as small
    size, maneuverability, resilience, efficiency, human-friendly interface, and safety
    – to enhance crop yields and farm productivity. Table 6 summarizes the diverse
    range of UGVs designed for agricultural operations. Table 6. Different types of

    above have a 4WD locomotive system because it offers ease of construction and
    control. The drawback of 4WD is that the wheels are strongly affected by terrains
    containing stone elements and/or cavities [85]. Hence, it is significant to explore
    other mechanisms, such as legged or wheel-legged locomotive systems. Some robots
    have computer vision systems, but due to the difficulty of developing an accurate
    and reliable system that replaces manual labor, most of these robots are built
    with a low-cost computer vision system, that is, using conventional RGB cameras.
    Moreover, most of the systems mentioned above are still in the research phase,
    with no commercial use on a large scale. 4.5.2. Unmanned aerial vehicles in agriculture
    Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or aerial robots are aircrafts with no human pilot
    on board. Depending on the type of technology incorporated to fly (wing structure)
    and autonomy level, there is a wide variety of UAVs [96]. For instance, according
    to wing type, UAVs can be fixed-wing (planes), single-rotor (helicopter), hybrid
    system (vertical takeoff and landing), and multirotor (drone). Among these, drones
    (multi-rotor technology) which are lifted and propelled by four (quadrotor) or
    six (hex-rotor) rotors, have become increasingly popular in the agriculture sector
    due to their mechanical simplicity in comparison to helicopters, which rely on
    a much more sophisticated plate control mechanism [97]. Similarly, according to
    autonomy level, UAVs can be either teleoperated in which the pilot provides references
    to each actuator of the aircraft so as to control it, in the same manner, an onboard
    pilot would, or tele-commanded in which the aircraft relies on an automatic controller
    on board that is in charge of maintaining a stable flight [96]. Equipped with
    the appropriate sensors (vision, infrared, multispectral, and hyperspectral cameras,
    etc.), agricultural UAVs allow farmers to obtain data (vegetation, leaf area,
    and reflectance indexes) from their fields to study dynamic changes in crops that
    cannot be detected by scouting the ground [98]. This data permits farmers to infer
    information related to crop diseases, nutrient deficiencies, water level, and
    other crop growth parameters. With this information, farmers can plan possible
    remedies (irrigation, fertilization, weed control, etc.). Table 7 reviews some
    of the UAV-based systems used for different agricultural operations. Table 7.

    Most of the systems mentioned above are still in the research phase, with no commercial
    use on a large scale. Other problems with these UAVs are associated with battery
    and flight time [96]. At the moment, lithium-ion batteries are being used because
    their capacity is larger than that of conventional batteries. But an increase
    in battery capacity increases the drone weight, and now research is undergoing
    to address this issue. In addition, the existing UAVs have complex user interfaces,
    and only experts can use them to perform agricultural tasks. By improving the
    user interface making it human-centered with multimodal feedback will allow people
    who are older or unfamiliar with UAV technology to control it more easily. 4.6.
    Big data and analytics in agriculture Rapid developments in IoT and CC technologies
    have increased the magnitude of data immeasurably. This data, also referred to
    as Big Data (BD), includes textual content (i.e., structured, semi-structured,
    and unstructured), and multimedia content (e.g., videos, images, audio) [119].
    The process of examining this data to uncover hidden patterns, unknown correlations,
    market trends, customer preferences, and other useful information is referred
    to as big data analytics (BDA). Big data is typically characterized according
    to five dimensions defined by five Vs, which are displayed in Fig. 12 [120]. The
    paradigm of BD-driven smart agriculture is comparatively new, but the trend of
    this application is positive as it has the capacity to bring a revolutionary change
    in the food supply chain and food security through increased production. Agricultural
    big data is usually generated from various sectors and stages in agriculture,
    which can be collected either from agricultural fields through ground sensors,
    aerial vehicles, and ground vehicles using special cameras and sensors; from governmental
    bodies in the form of reports and regulations; from private organizations through
    online web services; from farmers in the form of knowledge through surveys; or
    from social media [120]. The data can be environmental (weather, climate, moisture
    level, etc.), biological (plant disease), or geo-spatial depending on the agricultural
    domain and differs in volume, velocity, and formats [121]. The gathered data is
    stored in a computer database and processed by computer algorithms for analyzing
    seed characteristics, weather patterns, soil properties (like pH or nutrient content),
    marketing and trade management, consumers’ behavior, and inventory management.
    A variety of techniques and tools are employed to analyze big data in agriculture.
    A summary of some of the studies is given in Table 8. Machine learning, cloud-based
    platforms, and modeling and simulation are the most commonly used techniques.
    Particularly, machine learning tools are used in prediction, clustering, and classification
    problems. Whereas cloud platforms are used for large-scale data storing, preprocessing,
    and visualization. There are still many potential areas that are not adequately
    covered in existing literature, where BDA can be applied to address various agricultural
    issues. For instance, these include data-intensive greenhouses and indoor vertical
    farming systems, quality control and health monitoring of crops in outdoor and
    indoor farms, genetic engineering, decision support platforms to assist farmers
    in the design of indoor vertical farms, and scientific models for policymakers
    to assist them in decision-making regarding the sustainability of the physical
    ecosystem. Lastly, most systems are still in the prototypical stage. Download

    [125] 4.7. Artificial intelligence in agriculture Artificial intelligence (AI)
    involves the development of theory and computer systems capable of performing
    tasks requiring human intelligence, such as sensorial perception and decision-making
    [126]. Combined with CC, IoT, and big data, AI, particularly in the facet of machine
    learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), is regarded as one of the key drivers behind
    the digitization of agriculture. These technologies have the potential to enhance
    crop production and improve real-time monitoring, harvesting, processing, and
    marketing [127]. Several intelligent agricultural systems are developed that use
    ML and DL algorithms to determine various parameters like weed detection, yield
    prediction, or disease identification. These systems are discussed in the next
    two sub-sections. 4.7.1. Machine learning in agriculture Machine learning (ML)
    techniques are broadly classified into three categories: 1) supervised learning
    (linear regression, regression trees, non-linear regression, Bayesian linear regression,
    polynomial regression, and support vector regression), 2) unsupervised learning
    (k-means clustering, hierarchal clustering, anomaly detection, neural networks
    (NN), principal component analysis, independent component analysis, a-priori algorithm
    and singular value decomposition (SVD)); and 3) reinforcement learning (Markov
    decision process (MDP) and Q learning) [128]. ML techniques and algorithms are
    implemented in the agriculture sector for crop yield prediction, disease, and
    weed detection, weather prediction (rainfall), soil properties estimation (type,
    moisture content, pH, temperature, etc.), water management, determination of the
    optimal amount of fertilizer, and livestock production and management [129] Table
    9. presents a list of publications where different ML algorithms are utilized
    for various agricultural applications. From the analysis of these articles, “crop
    yield prediction” is a widely explored area, and linear regression, neural network
    (NN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) is the most used ML
    techniques to enable smart farming. The presented use cases are still in the research
    phase with no reported commercial usage at the moment. Moreover, it is also found
    that AI and ML techniques are sparsely explored in the greenhouse and indoor vertical
    farming systems, particularly hydroponics, aquaponics, and aeroponics. There are
    only a few publications available summarized in the same table where ML techniques
    are employed. Considering the digital transformation''s cyber-security and data
    privacy challenges, new approaches such as federated learning and privacy-preserving
    methods are being developed to enable digital farming [130]. These approaches
    build ML models from local parameters without sharing private data samples, thus
    mitigating security issues. Table 9. Machine learning-based agricultural systems.

    Prototype [148] 4.7.2. Deep learning in agriculture Deep learning (DL) represents
    the extension of classical ML that can solve complex problems (predictions and
    classification) particularly well and fast because more “depth” (complexity) is
    added into the model. The primary advantage of DL is feature learning which involves
    automatic extraction of features (high-level information) from large datasets
    [149]. Different DL algorithms are convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long
    short term memory (LSTM) networks, recurrent neural (RNN) networks, generative
    adversarial networks (GANs), radial basis function networks (RBFNs), multilayer
    perceptron (MLPs), feedforward artificial neural network (ANN), self-organizing
    maps (SOMs), deep belief networks (DBNs), restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs),
    and autoencoders. A detailed description of these algorithms, popular architectures,
    and training platforms is available at various sources [150]. Fig. 13 illustrates
    an example of DL architecture of CNN [151]. In the agriculture sector, DL algorithms
    are mostly used to solve problems associated with computer vision applications
    that target the prediction of key parameters, such as crop yields, soil moisture
    content, weather conditions, and crop growth conditions; the detection of diseases,
    pests, and weed; and the identification of leaf or plant species [152]. Computer
    vision is an interdisciplinary field that has been gaining huge amounts of traction
    in recent years due to the surge in CNNs. It offers methods and techniques that
    allow the processing of digital images accurately and enables computers to interpret
    and understand the visual world [153]. A summary of agricultural applications
    using DL and computer vision techniques is given in Table 10. Among all the DL
    algorithms, CNNs or Convet and its variants are the most used algorithms in agricultural
    applications. The variants of CNN are region-based CNNs (RCNN), Fast-RCNN, Faster-RCNN,
    YOLO, and Mask-RCNN, among which the first four are mostly used to solve object
    detection problems. Mask-RCNN, on the other hand, is used to solve instance segmentation
    problems. The reader could refer to the existing bibliography for a detailed description
    of these algorithms and their applications [152]. Few studies have also used other
    DL techniques. Talking about datasets, most DL models are trained using images,
    and few models are trained using sensor data gathered from fields. This shows
    that DL can be applied to a wide variety of datasets. It is also observed that
    most of the work is done on outdoor farms, whereas next-generation farms (environment-controlled)
    are not extensively explored. Though DL has the potential to enable digital farming,
    most systems are still in the prototype phase. Additionally, the new challenges
    imposed by cyber-security and privacy issues require optimization of current DL
    and computer vision approaches. Download : Download high-res image (334KB) Download

    decision support systems A decision support system (DSS) can be defined as a smart
    system that supports decision-making to specific demands and problems by providing
    operational answers to stakeholders and potential users based on useful information
    extracted from raw data, documents, personal knowledge, and/or models [170]. DSS
    can be data-driven, model-driven, communication-driven, document-driven, and knowledge-driven.
    The salient features of these DSSs are available at following source [171]. Fig.
    14 presents the general architecture of a DSS, consisting of four fundamental
    components, each having its specific purpose. Download : Download high-res image

    (adapted) [187]. Due to the evolution of agriculture 4.0, the amount of farming
    data has increased immensely. To transfer this heterogenous data into practical
    knowledge, platforms like agricultural decision support systems (ADSS) are required
    to make evidence-based and precise decisions regarding farm operation and facility
    layout [172]. Over the past few years, ADSSs are gaining much attention in the
    agriculture sector. A number of ADSSs have been developed that focus on a variety
    of agricultural aspects, such as farm management, water management, and environmental
    management. Table 11 presents a summary of the ADSSs found in the literature.
    From this analysis, most ADSSs have been found to not consider expert knowledge,
    which is highly valuable as it allows to development of systems as per user''s
    needs. The other reported issues with some of these ADDSs are complex GUIs, inadequate
    re-planning components, a lack of prediction and forecast abilities, and a lack
    of ability to adapt to uncertain and dynamic factors. It is also worth noting
    that all the ADSSs are for outdoor agricultural systems and are in the research
    phase. In comparison, the application of ADSS in indoor soilless farming is still
    very much unexploited. Table 11. Agricultural decision support systems. Use case

    As one of the main technologies of Industry 4.0, a cyber-physical system (CPS)
    refers to an automated distributed system that integrates physical processes with
    communication networks and computing infrastructures [184]. There are three standard
    CPS reference architecture models: namely, 5C, RAMI 4.0, and IIRA, and their detailed
    description is available at following source [185]. Among these, the 5C is a well-known
    reference model with widespread usage. The architecture of 5C consists of five
    levels which are represented in Fig. 15. CPS benefits from a variety of existing
    technologies such as agent systems, IoT, CC, augmented reality, big data, and
    ML [186]. Its implementation ensures scalability, adaptability, autonomy, reliability,
    resilience, safety, and security improvements. Download : Download high-res image
    (461KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 16. Schematic of a digital twinning
    process, (adapted) [199]. Agricultural field is regarded as one of the complex
    domains that can benefit from CPS technology. Agricultural cyber-physical systems
    (ACPSs) use advanced electronic technologies and agricultural facilities to build
    integrated farm management systems that interact with the physical environment
    to maintain an optimal growth environment for crops [188]. ACPSs collect the essential
    and appropriate data about climate, soil, and crops, with high accuracy and use
    it to manage watering, humidity, and plant health, etc. A variety of ACPSs has
    been developed for the management of different services, and their summary is
    given in Table 12. Looking at these ACPSs, most systems are still at the prototype
    and conceptual level. Moreover, most studies are conducted for outdoor farms,
    with only a few works published related to soil-based greenhouse systems. No study
    is found that is relevant to indoor soilless farming systems. ACPSs has attracted
    significant research interest because of their promising applications across different
    domains; deploying CPS models in real-life applications is still a challenge as
    it requires proper hardware and software [189]. Moreover, particular attention
    should be given to autonomy, robustness, and resilience while engineering ACPSs
    in order to handle the unpredictability of the environment and the uncertainty
    of the characteristics of agricultural facilities. There are multiple factors
    (humans, sensors, robots, crops, and data, among others) that impact ACPSs. To
    ensure a smooth operation while avoiding conflicts, errors, and disruptions, ACPSs
    need to be designed carefully and comprehensively. Table 12. Agricultural cyber-physical

    in agriculture Digital twin (DT) is a dynamic virtual replica of a real-life (physical)
    object of which it mirrors its behaviors and states over multiple stages of object''s
    lifecycle by using real-world data, simulation, and machine learning models, combined
    with data analytics to enable understanding, learning, and reasoning [198]. A
    complete description of the DT concept for any physical system requires consolidation
    and formalization of various characteristics, including the physical and virtual
    entities, the physical and virtual environments, the metrology, and realization
    modules that perform the physical to virtual and the virtual to physical connection
    or twinning, the twinning and twinning rate, and the physical and virtual processes
    [199]. The schematic showing the mapping of these characteristics is shown in
    Fig. 16. The DT concept has gained prominence due to the advances in the technologies
    such as the Internet of Things, big data, wireless sensor networks, and cloud
    computing. This is because these technologies allow real-time monitoring of physical
    twins at high spatial resolutions through both miniature devices and remote sensing
    that produce ever-increasing data streams [21]. The concept of DT in agricultural
    applications is rather immature as compared to other disciplines with its first
    references occurred in 2017; hence its added value has not yet been discussed
    extensively [21]. This is because framing is a highly complex and dynamic domain
    because of its dependence on natural conditions (climate, soil, humidity) and
    presence of living physical twins (plants and animals) and non-living physical
    twins (indoor farm buildings, grow beds, outdoor agricultural fields, agricultural
    machinery). The non-living physical twins interact directly or indirectly with
    plants and animals (living physical twins), thereby introducing more challenges
    for DT in agriculture. Whereas in other domains such as manufacturing DTs are
    mostly concerned with non-living physical twins. Table 13 summarises the agricultural
    DTs developed in the last 10 years. Table 13. Digital twins in agriculture Use

    have focused on open-air farming systems. Only one study is found that has proposed
    DT for soil-based vertical farming system and one study that implemented DT for
    soilless farming system (aquaponics). This might be because the design and management
    of modern farming systems are challenging. Moreover, most DTs are in the research
    phase with no commercial deployment at the moment. The reported benefits of the
    DT applications in agriculture are cost reductions, catastrophe prevention, clearer
    decision making, and efficient management operations, which can be applied to
    several agricultural subfields like plant and animal breeding, aquaponics, vertical
    farming, cropping systems, and livestock farming. While DT technology has great
    potential, achieving the synchronization between the physical entity and its digital
    counterpart is challenging. The complexity of this process is further amplified
    in agricultural systems due to the idiosyncrasies of living physical twins. Hence,
    implementation of agricultural DT should start with micro-farms, which can then
    be gradually enhanced to an intelligent and autonomous version by incorporating
    more components. 4.11. Roadblocks in digitization of agriculture industry This
    section provides an answer to RQ3 by listing a series of interconnected roadblocks
    hampering a larger adoption of digital technologies in the agriculture sector.
    After analysing 148 articles, 21 roadblocks are identified which can be categorized
    at technical and socio-economic levels. 4.12. Technical roadblocks • Interoperability:
    data is considered a cornerstone for the success of smart systems. Agricultural
    data usually comes from multiple heterogeneous sources such as thousands of individual
    farmlands, animal factories, and enterprise applications. This data can have diverse
    formats, making data integration complex. Hence, data interoperability is essential
    to enhance the value of this massively dispersed data after systematic data collection,
    storage, processing, and knowledge mining [208]. Likewise, for establishing effective
    communication between heterogeneous devices, they need to be interconnected and
    interoperable. With cross-technology communication, interoperability of the system
    can be improved [209]. • Standardization: to fully exploit the digital technologies
    for smart farming applications, standardization of the devices is essential. Output
    differences can occur because of misinterpretation and alterations from time to
    time. With standardization, the interoperability issues of the devices, applications,
    and systems can also be resolved [25]. • Dataquality: to produce meaningful results,
    data quality is also crucial along with data security, storage, and openness.
    The lack of decentralized data management systems is another roadblock hindering
    the adoption of smart farming practices [9]. This issue decreases the willingness
    of multiple actors to share agriculture data. • Hardwareimplementation: the deployment
    of a smart agricultural setup in large-scale open fields is extremely challenging.
    This is because all the hardware consisting of IoT devices, wireless sensor networks,
    sensor nodes, machinery, and equipment directly exposed to harsh environmental
    conditions such as heavy rainfall, high/low-temperature levels, extreme humidity,
    strong wind speeds and many other possible dangers which can destroy electronic
    circuits or disrupt their normal functionality [210]. A possible solution is to
    build an adequate casing for all the costly devices that is robust and durable
    enough to endure real field conditions [211]. • Adequatepower sources: typically,
    the wireless devices deployed at farms consistently operate for a long time and
    have limited battery life. A suitable energy saving scheme is necessary because,
    in case of any failure, instant battery replacement is complicated, especially
    in open-air farms where devices are strategically placed with minimum access [210].
    The possible solutions to optimize energy consumption are usage of low power sensors
    and, proper management of communication [24,212]. Wireless power transfer and
    self-supporting wireless system are other promising solutions to eliminate the
    need for battery replacement by recharging the batteries through electromagnetic
    waves. However, long-distance wireless charging is needed in most agricultural
    applications [9]. Ambient energy harvesting from rivers, fluid flow, movement
    of vehicles and, ground surface using sensor nodes offers another viable solution,
    but the converted electrical energy is limited at present – posing the need to
    improve power conversion efficiency [213]. • Reliability: The reliability of devices,
    as well as corresponding software applications, is crucial. This is because IoT
    devices need to gather and transfer the data based on which decisions are made
    using several software packages. Unreliable sensing, processing, and transmission
    can cause false monitoring data reports, long delays, and even data loss – eventually
    impacting the performance of agricultural system [25]. • Adaptability: agricultural
    environments are complex, dynamic, and rapidly changing. Hence, when designing
    a system, it is pertinent for the devices and applications to proactively adapt
    with the other entities under uncertain and dynamic factors - offering the needed
    performance [214]. • Robust wirelessarchitectures: wireless networks and communication
    technologies offer several benefits in terms of low cost, wide-area coverage,
    adequate networking flexibility, and high scalability. But dynamic agriculture
    environments such as temperature variations, living objects’ movements, and the
    presence of obstacles pose severe challenges to reliable wireless communication.
    For instance, fluctuations in the signal intensity occur due to the multipath
    propagation effects – causing unstable connectivity and inadequate data transmission
    [215]. These factors impact the performance of the agricultural system. Hence,
    there is a need for robust and fault-tolerant wireless architectures with appropriate
    location of sensor nodes, antenna height, network topology, and communication
    protocols that also require minimum maintenance [11]. • Interference: another
    challenge is wireless interference and degradation of the quality of service because
    of the dense deployment of IoT devices and wireless sensor networks. These issues
    can be mitigated with efficient channel scheduling between heterogeneous sensing
    devices, cognitive radio-assisted WSNs, and emerging networking primitives such
    as concurrent transmission [216]. Since agriculture devices are distributed at
    indoor greenhouses, outdoor farmlands, underground areas, or even water areas,
    cross-media communication between underground, underwater, and air is also required
    for the complete incorporation of smart technologies [217]. • Security and privacy:
    the distributed nature of smart agricultural systems brings potential vulnerabilities
    to cyber-attacks such as eavesdropping, data integrity, denial-of-service attacks,
    or other types of disruptions that may risk privacy, integrity, and availability
    of the system [218]. Cyber-security is a major challenge that needs to be addressed
    within the context of smart farming, with diverse privacy-preserving mechanisms
    and federated learning approaches [130]. • Compatibility: to achieve the standards
    of fragmentation and scalability, the models or software applications developed
    should be flexible and run on any machine installed in the agricultural system
    [13]. • Resource optimization: farmers require a resource optimization process
    to estimate the optimal number of IoT devices and gateways, cloud storage size,
    and amount of transmitted data to improve farm profitability. Since farms have
    different sizes and need distinct types of sensors to measure different variables,
    resource optimization is challenging [219]. Secondly, most of the farm management
    systems do not offer run-time customization in relation to the distinct requirements
    of farmers. Hence, complex mathematical models and algorithms are required to
    estimate adequate resource allocation [75]. • Scalability: the number of devices,
    machinery, and sensors installed at farms is increasing gradually due to advancements
    in technologies. To support these entities, gateways, network applications, and
    back-end databases should be reliable and scalable [220]. • Human-centereduserinterfaces:
    complex user interfaces of existing agricultural applications and devices are
    impeding smart farming practices. Most GUI is designed in a way that only experts
    can use to perform agricultural tasks. Improving the user interface by making
    it human-centered with multimodal feedback will allow a larger group of people
    to use it to perform different agricultural operations [96]. 4.13. Socio-economic
    roadblocks • Gap between farmers and researchers: the participation of farmers
    is a key factor toward the success of the digitization of the agricultural industry.
    Farmers face a lot of problems during the agri-food production process, which
    smart technologies could fix, but agricultural experts are not usually aware of
    these issues [16]. Moreover, to devise an adequate smart solution, first, it is
    important to fully understand the nature of problems. Hence, it is essential to
    bridge the gap between farmers, agricultural professionals, and AI researchers.
    • Costs associated with smart systems: the costs associated with the adoption
    of smart technologies and systems are the major deterrent in the digitization
    of the agricultural sector. These costs usually involve deployment, operating,
    and maintenance costs. The deployment costs of smart systems are usually very
    high as they involve; i) hardware installation such as autonomous robots and drones,
    WSNs, gateways, and base station infrastructure, etc., to perform certain farm
    operations, and ii) hiring the skilled labour [221]. Likewise, to facilitate data
    processing, management of IoT devices and equipment, and knowledge exchange, subscription
    of centralized networks and software packages is required, which ultimately increases
    the operating costs [222]. Though sometimes service providers offer free subscription
    packages with restricted features, the amount of storage capacity is limited.
    To ensure the adequate operations of the smart system, occasional maintenance
    is required, which then also adds up to total costs. Other types of costs associated
    with smart systems deployment could be environmental, ethical, and social costs.
    To overcome cost related roadblocks, initiatives focusing on cooperative farming
    are needed that provide; i) support services for better handling of costs and
    needed investments, and ii) hardware solutions to transform conventional equipment
    into smart farm-ready machinery to reduce high initial costs [222]. • Digital
    division: another factor that is slowing the digitization of the agricultural
    sector is the lack of knowledge of digital technologies and their applications.
    The majority of farmers have no idea about the significance of digital technologies,
    how to implement and use them, and which technology is suitable for their farm
    and meets their requirements [14]. Hence, it is essential to educate farmers about
    modern farming technologies and systems. Moreover, different strategies are needed
    to build tools using natural language that farmers with low education levels can
    easily understand [223]. • Return on investment: in agriculture, the profit margin
    is very important like other sectors. When it comes to the implementation of advanced
    technologies, farmers have concerns related to the time to recover the investment
    and to the difficulties in evaluating the advantages [12]. • Trust building: unlike
    in other disciplines, building trust regarding the effectiveness of smart technologies
    in agriculture is difficult because many decisions affect systems that involve
    living and non-living entities, and consequences can be hard to reverse [16].
    Additionally, insufficient proof of the impact of digital tools on-farm productivity
    further intensifies the current challenges. • Laws and regulations: different
    regions and countries have different legal frameworks which impact the implementation
    of digital technologies in the agriculture sector, particularly in monitoring
    and agri-food supply [70]. Likewise, regulations related to resource allocation
    (spectrum for wireless devices), data privacy, and security also vary from one
    country to another [70]. • Connectivity infrastructure: most less-developed countries
    usually have insufficient connectivity infrastructure that limits access to advanced
    digital tools that would help to turn data from heterogenous sources into valuable
    and actionable insights [10]. 4.14. Discussion This section discusses the main
    conclusions of RQ1, RQ2, and RQ3. In addition, added value, considerations, and
    future directions are also presented to ensure higher accuracy and great advancements
    in agricultural industry. 4.15. RQ1, RQ2 and RQ3 The present study tried to articulate
    the emerging digital technologies being implemented in agricultural industry to
    anticipate the future trajectories of agriculture 4.0. By looking at Table 2,
    Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, Table 6, Table 7, Table 8, Table 9, Table 10, Table
    11, Table 12, Table 13 in section 4, it can be seen some technologies such as
    big data and analytics, wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and
    digital twins are not significantly explored in agriculture. A reason for this
    gap could be that implementing advanced technologies with more complex operations
    can be expensive, at least in the early experimental phase of their adoption.
    Hence, the development of these technologies in agricultural industry should increase
    in the coming years. The results of SLR also show that IoT is significantly implemented
    in farms. This is due to the broad functionality of IoT such as in the monitoring,
    tracking and tracing, agriculture machinery, and precision agriculture [21]. It
    can be said that IoT is one of the main research objectives within the agriculture
    4.0 approaches. Nevertheless, only few studies have considered data security and
    reliability, scalability, and interoperability while developing an intelligent
    agricultural system. The research findings also demonstrated that most use cases
    are still in the prototype phase. The possible reason could be because most agricultural
    operations have to do with living subjects, like animals and plants or perishable
    products, and developing systems is harder than non-living human-made systems.
    Another reason might be that agriculture is a slow adopter of technology because
    of transdisciplinary nature of this field, and hence to develop intelligent systems,
    the agricultural community must become familiar will all the digital technologies.
    Lastly, variations in plant/crops’ species, and growth conditions also make digitization
    of agricultural systems complex [188]. The SLR findings also show that most of
    the systems are developed for open-air soil-based farms contrary to indoor farms
    (soilless and soil-based). This is due to complex design and management of indoor
    farms particularly soilless farms where parameters and factors (pH, air temperature,
    humidity, etc.) to be controlled are diverse [5]. But with introduction of digital
    technologies and data-driven computer applications in indoor farms, a more robust
    control of the process can be achieved. Furthermore, it is also revealed from
    SLR that limited research is conducted in three (soil management, fruit detection
    and counting and crop quality management) out of nine different service categories
    mentioned in section 3. This corroborates that substantial research and development
    is needed in some areas to ensure successful digitization of agriculture industry
    in developed countries as well as in developing countries. The complexity of agriculture
    ecosystem presents a series of interconnected roadblocks that hinder the full
    integration of digital technologies for agriculture 4.0 realization. Hence, it
    is essential to identify potential roadblocks in order to come up with strategic
    solutions to overcome them. This study is an attempt to explore what these roadblocks
    are. Based on analysis, 21 roadblocks were identified and classified at technical
    and socio-economic levels. These roadblocks are listed in section 5, which suggests
    what needs to be done for digitization of agricultural industry on larger scale.
    But it is still not known, to what extent elimination or mitigation of these roadblocks
    assist in successful integration of digital technologies. 4.16. Added value of
    agricultural digitization Based on analysis, several benefits that can motivate
    framers and other actors to support digitization of agricultural industry are
    identified and summarised below. The presented benefits have potential to maximise
    the farm''s productivity and enhance product quality, but they should not be considered
    a panacea for challenges associated with smart agriculture [222]. • Improved agility:
    digital technologies improve the agility of farm operations. Through real-time
    surveillance and forecast systems, farmers or agricultural experts can rapidly
    react to any potential fluctuations in environmental and water conditions to save
    crops [221]. • Green process: digital technologies make the farming process more
    environmentally friendly and climate-resilient by significantly reducing the usage
    of in-field fuel, nitrogen fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides [224]. • Resource
    use efficiency: digital platforms can improve resource use efficiency by enhancing
    the quantity and quality of agricultural output and limiting the usage of water,
    energy, fertilizers, and pesticides [3]. • Time and cost savings: digital technologies
    enable significant time and cost savings by automating different operations, such
    as harvesting, sowing, or irrigation, controlling the application of fertilizers
    or pesticides, and scheduling the irrigation [225]. • Asset management: digital
    technologies allow real-time surveillance of farm properties and equipment to
    prevent theft, expedite component replacement and perform routine maintenance
    [10]. • Product safety: digital technologies ensure adequate farm productivity
    and guarantee a safe and nutritious supply of agri-food products by preventing
    fraud related to adulteration, counterfeit, and artificial enhancement [218].
    4.17. Considerations and future prospects The upcoming initiatives would result
    in significant improvements in the agricultural sector. But in order to make things
    sustainable for small and medium-scale growers, roadblocks mentioned in section
    5 need to be addressed first. Awareness campaigns highlighting the significance
    of smart agriculture at every level of the agricultural value chain and promoting
    innovative ways (such as gamification) to encourage stakeholders to take on an
    active role in the digital revolution can mitigate some of the mentioned roadblocks
    [9]. Government level initiatives, grants and endowments, public-private partnerships,
    the openness of data, and regional basis research work can also assist in coping
    with potential roadblocks. Lastly, a roadmap can be adopted while developing a
    smart agriculture system, starting from basic architecture with few components
    and simpler functionality, gradually adding components and functionality to develop
    a complex system with the full potential of digitization [21]. These considerations
    can pave the way for successful implementation of agriculture 4.0. The future
    prospects of digital technologies in smart agriculture involve using explainable
    artificial intelligence to monitor crop growth, estimate crop biomass, evaluate
    crop health, and control pests and diseases. Explainable AI fades away the traditional
    black-box concept of machine learning and enables understanding the reasons behind
    any specific decision [15]. Description of big data through common semantics and
    ontologies and the adoption of open standards have great potential to boost research
    and development towards smart farming . Similarly, to ensure enhanced connectivity
    and live streaming of crop data, 5G technology need to be extensively explored
    [6]. 5G technology will minimize internet costs and augment the overall user experience
    of farm management and food safety by performing accurate crop inspections remotely
    [226]. Furthermore, it will significantly bridge the gap between stakeholders
    by keeping them well informed on produce availability. Lastly, blockchain in combination
    with IoT and other technologies can be implemented to address the challenges related
    to data privacy and security [227]. 4.18. Transition to Agriculture 5.0 The industrial
    revolutions have always brought a breakthrough in the agricultural sector. As
    formally discussed in previous sections, agriculture 4.0 has great potential to
    counterbalance the growing food demands and prepare for future by reinforcing
    agricultural systems with WSN, IoT, AI, etc. While the realization of agriculture
    4.0 is still underway, there is already a talk about agriculture 5.0. Agriculture
    5.0 extends agriculture 4.0 with inclusion of industry 5.0 principles to produce
    healthy and affordable food while ensuring to prevent degradation of the ecosystems
    on which life depends [228]. The European Commission formally called for the Fifth
    Industrial Revolution (industry 5.0) in 2021 after observing that industry 4.0
    focuses less on the original principles of social fairness and sustainability
    but more on digitalization and AI-driven technologies for increasing the efficiency
    and flexibility [229]. Industry 5.0 complements and extends industry 4.0 concept
    to recognize the human-centricity, sustainability, and resilience [230]. It involves
    refining the collaborative interactions between humans and machines, reducing
    environmental impact through circular economy, and developing high degree of robustness
    in systems to achieve optimal balance between efficiency and productivity. The
    enabling technologies of industry 5.0 are Cobots (collaborative robots), smart
    materials with embedded bio-inspired sensors, digital twins, AI, energy efficient
    and secure data management, renewable energy sources, etc [229].. In agriculture
    5.0 settings, farm''s production efficiency and crop quality can be enhanced by
    assigning repetitive and monotonous tasks to the machines and the tasks which
    need critical thinking to the humans. For this purpose, similar to manufacturing
    sector cyber physical cognitive systems (CPCS) that observe/study the environment
    and take actions accordingly should be developed for agricultural sector. This
    may include collaborative farm robots which will work in the fields and assist
    crop producers in tedious tasks such as seed sowing and harvesting etc. Likewise,
    digital twins in agriculture 5.0 can also offer significant value by identifying
    technical issues in agricultural systems and overcoming them at a faster speed,
    detecting crop diseases, and making crop yield predictions at a higher accuracy
    rate. This shows that agriculture 5.0 has potential to pave a way for climate
    smart, sustainable and resilient agriculture but as of now, it is in the developing
    phase. 5. Conclusions Increased concerns about global food security have accelerated
    the need for next-generation industrial farms and intensive production methods
    in agriculture. At the forefront of this modern agricultural era, digital technologies
    offered by Industry 4.0 initiative are suggesting a myriad of creative solutions.
    The scientific community and researchers integrate disruptive technologies in
    conventional agriculture systems to increase crop yields, minimize costs, reduce
    wastes, and maintain process inputs. An SLR discussing the prevailing state of
    these technologies in the agriculture sector is presented in this study. After
    applying SLR protocol, 148 articles were considered from the time frame of the
    year 2011 to 2021. Various research questions pertaining to i) current and continuing
    research trends, ii) functionality, maturity level, farm type and tools and techniques
    used, iii) primary roadblocks, and iv) added value of digital technologies; were
    put forward and answered. Several conclusions are drawn such as integration of
    big data and analytics, wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and
    digital twins in agriculture is only in its infancy, and most use cases are in
    the prototype phase. Likewise, 21 roadblocks are identified and classified at
    technical and socioeconomic levels. To ensure the digitization of agricultural
    industry, these roadblocks must be analyzed and overcome. The added value of digital
    technologies in agriculture industry are also identified and presented in the
    study. Overall, this study contributes to the research being carried around agriculture
    4.0. The primary limitation of this review is twofold: firstly, only three online
    repositories are considered for literature search (Scopus, IEEE and Science Direct),
    and secondly additional keywords and synonyms might return more studies. In both
    scenarios, it is highly unlikely that the overall findings would change. For the
    future work, additional research databases and aspects can be considered to provide
    holistic overview of agricultural industry in terms of digitization. Moreover,
    studies targeting agriculture 5.0 in general will also be included. Declaration

    Tutorial on Agricultural IoT: Fundamental Concepts, Architectures, Routing, and
    Optimization. IoT 2023, 4, 265-318. Copy Abstract This paper presents an in-depth
    contextualized tutorial on Agricultural IoT (Agri-IoT), covering the fundamental
    concepts, assessment of routing architectures and protocols, and performance optimization
    techniques via systematic survey and synthesis of related literature. The negative
    impacts of climate change and the increasing global population on food security
    and unemployment threats have motivated the adoption of the wireless sensor network
    (WSN)-based Agri-IoT as an indispensable underlying technology in precision agriculture
    and greenhouses to improve food production capacities and quality. However, most
    related Agri-IoT testbed solutions have failed to achieve their performance expectations
    due to the lack of an in-depth and contextualized reference tutorial that provides
    a holistic overview of communication technologies, routing architectures, and
    performance optimization modalities based on users’ expectations. Thus, although
    IoT applications are founded on a common idea, each use case (e.g., Agri-IoT)
    varies based on specific performance and users expectations as well as its technological,
    architectural, and deployment requirements. Likewise, the agricultural setting
    is a unique and hostile area where conventional IoT technologies do not apply,
    hence the need for this tutorial. Consequently, this tutorial addresses these
    via the following contributions: (1) a systematic overview of the fundamental
    concepts, technologies, and architectural standards of WSN-based Agri-IoT, (2)
    an evaluation of the technical design requirements of a robust, location-independent,
    and affordable Agri-IoT, (3) a comprehensive survey of the benchmarking fault
    tolerance techniques, communication standards, routing and medium access control
    (MAC) protocols, and WSN-based Agri-IoT testbed solutions, and (4) an in-depth
    case study on how to design a self-healing, energy-efficient, affordable, adaptive,
    stable, autonomous, and cluster-based WSN-specific Agri-IoT from a proposed taxonomy
    of multi-objective optimization (MOO) metrics that can guarantee an optimized
    network performance. Furthermore, this tutorial established new taxonomies of
    faults, architectural layers, and MOO metrics for cluster-based Agri-IoT (CA-IoT)
    networks and a 3-tier objective framework with remedial measures for designing
    an efficient associated supervisory protocol for cluster-based Agri-IoT networks.

    \ internet of things, monitoring and control \n1 \nINTRODUCTION \nDue to rising\
    \ food demand and a growing human population, agriculture is the primary food\
    \ supplier and the most \nprominent labor user. It is also one of the essential\
    \ areas in a country's economy, according to gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) [1],\
    \ [2]. Water availability is an essential factor in optimizing the growth of crops\
    \ so that water \nscarcity can threaten food security. This reason makes water\
    \ conservation an essential factor in overcoming water \nshortages while increasing\
    \ yields. [3, 4]. Moreover, the development of agricultural technology and more\
    \ efficient \nagricultural management can produce productive crops and quality\
    \ harvests through greenhouse technology. \nDeveloping greenhouses for agriculture\
    \ can increase crop yields and improve water use efficiency [5].  \nAround 3.5%\
    \ of the world's agricultural land uses greenhouse and hydroponic systems to conserve\
    \ water use and \nother benefits such as crop protection and quality yields. A\
    \ greenhouse is a building with a wooden or metal \nfoundation covered with nets\
    \ or transparent material. Since 1960 the greenhouse has evolved from a building\
    \ that \nonly protects plants into a system for studying plant growth in a controlled\
    \ environment [6, 7]. Changes in \nagricultural land usage, lower irrigation water\
    \ output in primary, secondary, and tertiary canals, and global \nmicroclimate\
    \ changes contribute to the rising use of greenhouses in world agriculture [8].\
    \  \nAgricultural ecosystems (soil, nutrients, temperature, humidity, sunlight,\
    \ wind, and air composition) can be adapted \nto the needs of the plants planted\
    \ in greenhouses to extend productive plant life, change planting seasons, \n\
    increase crop yields and improve harvest quality. [9, 10]. Moving crops from their\
    \ natural environment to \ngreenhouses protect plants from weather and microclimate\
    \ uncertainties. On the downside, a greenhouse is a \nplace that can store solar\
    \ heat and requires resources to manage the microclimate according to plant needs,\
    \ \nespecially in countries with tropical climates. [4, 11]. Crop growth problems\
    \ arise in agriculture that depends on rain \nand drought; runoff and erosion\
    \ problems also arise during heavy rains. Water control is needed to meet crop\
    \ \nwater needs while conserving water [12]. The water control system functioned\
    \ as a regulator for water flow \naccording to the plant's needs in its growth\
    \ phase [13, 14]. \nConventional irrigation systems use a uniform amount of water\
    \ to fields from one corner to another during their \ngrowth period regardless\
    \ of the type of plant and its water needs. The result is water-wasting, where\
    \ one side of \nthe land has sufficient water, while the other can have excess\
    \ or lack of water [15]. Therefore, a control system \nknown as an intelligent\
    \ irrigation system is needed to support plants' water needs while saving water.\
    \ The way the \nsystem works, in general, is to adapt to the type of plant and\
    \ then automatically calculate the water needs of the \n657 \n \nIrfan Ardiansah,\
    \ et al. - An overview of IOT based intelligent irrigation systems for greenhouse:\
    \ recent trends and \nchallenges \n \nJournal of Applied Engineering Science-\
    \ Vol.20, No 3, 2022 -www.engineeringscience.rs \n \nplant and schedule water\
    \ supply based on the plant growth phase [16]. Intelligent irrigation systems\
    \ are suitable for \nuse in a greenhouse because a greenhouse has an enclosed\
    \ structure to reduce or eliminate parameters affecting \nplant growth, such as\
    \ seasons, rainfall, climate change, plant pests and diseases, and environmental\
    \ changes [17, \n18]. \nIntelligent irrigation systems are part of precision agriculture,\
    \ also known as smart farming, which integrates \ninformation technology, communication\
    \ technology, and control technology to automate various agricultural \nactivities\
    \ that humans initially did. With an intelligent irrigation system, the irrigation\
    \ process can run optimally in \nmanaging water to meet the needs of plants [19].\
    \ Intelligent irrigation systems can manage water needs based on \nvarious parameters\
    \ such as microclimate conditions, weather, sunlight, water quality such as acidity\
    \ (pH), turbidity \n(TDS), and electrical conductivity (EC), along with plant\
    \ growth phases through the Internet of Things (IoT) devices. \nAn intelligent\
    \ irrigation system can improve irrigation decisions to achieve water savings\
    \ and increased yields [20–\n22]. \nThe intelligent irrigation system is one of\
    \ the best systems in managing and saving water while maximizing \nharvests; water\
    \ is distributed evenly to each plant according to its needs and minimizes wasted\
    \ water [23]. This \nsystem can also mix nutrients and water and help deliver\
    \ them directly to the root zone, ensuring it is always in \noptimal moist conditions,\
    \ minimizing surface runoff, preventing root rot, and eliminating percolation.\
    \ The advantage \nis increased crop productivity, and better harvest quality also\
    \ ensures optimal water efficiency. Nevertheless, good \nintegration between IoT\
    \ devices, monitoring, control, and data acquisition can be done automatically\
    \ with minimum \nintervention to get an optimal and efficient, intelligent irrigation\
    \ system [24, 25]. \nIn the intelligent irrigation system, the controller can\
    \ process input data, present information, and manage irrigation \nbased on greenhouse\
    \ conditions, especially crop conditions to prevent water deficit. Nevertheless,\
    \ in addition to \nsystem automation, it is necessary to present current and past\
    \ system conditions to users, both plant responses to \nthe system and vice versa.\
    \ This method ensures that water management runs smoothly, and users can study\
    \ \nhistorical data as a reference for the next planting period and ensure optimal\
    \ farming [26–29]. This process \nrequires real-time monitoring, sophisticated\
    \ control systems, and precise instruments. The difference between a \nmonitoring\
    \ system and a control system is that the control system regulates the hardware\
    \ according to conditional \nconstraints. The control system manages the hardware\
    \ and software by defining the output and input parameters \nprecisely. The input\
    \ is microclimate parameters, plant properties, weather conditions, water quality,\
    \ and other \nsensors collect helpful information [30–33]. \nMany articles published\
    \ on IoT focus on agriculture, as discussed by [30, 34]. IoT is one of the best\
    \ inventions of \nthe 21st century in agriculture. In addition, review articles\
    \  [21], [35] discuss IoT opportunities in agriculture or \nintelligent farming\
    \ and how the connection between IoT, data mining, data science, and machine learning\
    \ \nsustainability supports agriculture. [36] describes the automation model for\
    \ monitoring and controlling the \nagricultural sector and predicting information\
    \ based on past data. There are currently no review studies that explore \nthe\
    \ monitoring and control strategy of intelligent irrigation systems in greenhouses,\
    \ necessitating the formation of \nintelligent irrigation system review articles\
    \ that focus on integrating various monitoring and control materials. As a \n\
    result, this study will cover intelligent irrigation system monitoring and control\
    \ mechanisms and their relevance to \ngreenhouses and irrigation. \nThis study\
    \ aims to classify the results of previous research, identify the results, and\
    \ bridge them with future trends \nto identify future research. Chapter 2 discusses\
    \ research methodology, and Chapter 3 discusses various irrigation \nmethods used\
    \ by intelligent irrigation systems. In contrast, Chapter 4 discusses monitoring\
    \ and controlling \nstrategies for IoT and then continues to Chapter 5, discussing\
    \ the integration of artificial intelligence. The last \nchapter discusses future\
    \ directions and trends in intelligent irrigation. \n2 REVIEW METHODOLOGY \nThe\
    \ methodology applied in selecting published literature with the theme of intelligent\
    \ farming focuses on the topic \nof intelligent irrigation systems and their control\
    \ systems by using an extensive search on several online libraries of \nmultidisciplinary\
    \ journals as Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, Springer, MDPI, and IOP, as well\
    \ as online \nengineering libraries as Agricola and IEEE Xplore. This technique\
    \ produces many research articles relevant to \nintelligent farming and irrigation\
    \ systems and their relationship to monitoring and control. That is why it is\
    \ essential \nto check the reputation of the publisher's journal before using\
    \ the article through the SCOPUS and ScimagoJR \nwebsites. This review's selection\
    \ of relevant articles emphasizes the latest journal articles in the last eleven\
    \ years \n(2011 - 2021); it can be seen in Figure 1a that in 2020 there was a\
    \ surge in articles discussing monitoring, control, \nand artificial intelligence\
    \ in agriculture. Other conditions are that all articles must be published in\
    \ SCOPUS indexed \njournals and conference proceedings. As shown in Figure 1b,\
    \ which shows the percentage of articles indexed by \nSCOPUS with articles with\
    \ Quartile 1 dominating research in this field means that the research is internationally\
    \ \nrecognized and has the best quality content. All articles used are smart farming,\

    \ \npositions \n3 TYPES OF IRRIGATION \nPlants need water at regular intervals\
    \ to grow and develop; in agriculture, this watering technique is called \nirrigation.\
    \ Irrigation has two methods, namely conventional and modern. Conventional agriculture\
    \ usually uses rain \nand surface irrigation to irrigate its land [37, 38]. The\
    \ problem is how to predict rain accurately, and surface \nirrigation does not\
    \ continuously irrigate the entire land with a uniform discharge. Surface irrigation,\
    \ classified as \nconventional irrigation, works by distributing water from springs\
    \ or rivers to the ground surface following gravity; \nmonitoring is done manually\
    \ by looking at the water level without IoT and automation [37].  \nDeveloping\
    \ countries generally use surface irrigation, for example, Indonesia. It uses\
    \ it to irrigate paddy fields by \nconstructing furrows that connect water sources\
    \ with rice fields and irrigate them. However, this method requires a \nlevel\
    \ ground surface to ensure adequate water distribution [39]. On the other hand,\
    \ surface irrigation results in high \nlevels of water loss due to evaporation,\
    \ uncontrolled water discharge, and percolation, which can reduce soil \nnutrient\
    \ levels resulting in sub-optimal crop yields [37]. There are two commonly used\
    \ surface irrigations: (1) \nFurrow irrigation is interpreted as water flowing\
    \ through small furrows made on the land slope. Water enters the soil \nfrom the\
    \ bottom and sides of the furrow and moves laterally and downwards to moisten\
    \ the soil and simultaneously \ncarry dissolved salts, fertilizers, and herbicides\
    \ [40]. Good tillage with uniform slopes can give better results from \nthis method.\
    \ Furrow irrigation is suitable for various soils, slopes, and crops especially\
    \ row crops. Crops that will be \ndamaged if water covers the stems or crowns\
    \ should use furrow irrigation [40, 41]. Furrow irrigation is also suitable \n\
    for tree crops. In the early stages of tree planting, using one furrow beside\
    \ the tree row may be sufficient, but as the \ntree grows, creating two or more\
    \ new furrows is necessary to provide sufficient water [42]. (2) Flooding Irrigation\
    \ is \nan irrigation method commonly used to provide water in lowland rice cultivation\
    \ and generally, water carried out \ncontinuously. Flooding is carried out continuously\
    \ at the same height throughout plant growth, starting from planting \nuntil several\
    \ days before harvest [43]. The use of flooding irrigation depends on sufficient\
    \ water to flood the land \nsurface with 10 cm of water. The disadvantage is inhibiting\
    \ plant growth and water wastage [44]. Because flooding \nirrigation uses water\
    \ excessively, flooding irrigation evolved into intermittent irrigation by flooding\
    \ and drying the \nland alternately from planting season until one week before\
    \ the flowering. The water level is maintained at 3 to 5 \ncm during flowering.\
    \ Giving water this way can reduce water usage up to 30 percent without reducing\
    \ crop yields \n[43–45] \n Modern irrigation offers uniform discharge for each\
    \ plant, including nutrients and saving water, mainly when \nplanting is carried\
    \ out in a greenhouse, making it easier to monitor water quantity and quality\
    \ and regulate water \nsupply schedules [46, 47]. The amount of water delivered\
    \ is determined by the plant's demands, irrigation method, \nand type of growing\
    \ medium. The choice of irrigation method influences the type of nutrients, the\
    \ number of \nnutrients, the rate of infiltration, evaporation, water absorption,\
    \ and drainage [12]. \nModern irrigation uses less water and is more efficient\
    \ than conventional irrigation, and this method saves more \nenergy and water.\
    \ It is an effective method for use in areas where water is scarce or has irregular\
    \ rains. This \nmethod allows farmers to cultivate crops consistently, creating\
    \ a reliable food supply [3, 11]. Modern irrigation relies \non water from wells,\
    \ lakes, and reservoirs stored in water tanks and then irrigates plants using\
    \ gravity or water \npumps [12]. The method of giving water is even more specific,\

    \ Radio Service (GPRS) and Zigbee module and built a microprocessor-based gateway\
    \ \nto better control water discharge with water efficiency than conventional\
    \ irrigation systems, with the difference \nbetween conventional and modern irrigation\
    \ can be seen in Figure 2. \n \nFig 2. Types of irrigation \n3.1 \nSprinkler Irrigation\
    \ \nFarmers use sprinkler irrigation to mimic precipitation patterns. They used\
    \ small sprinkler nozzles connected to an \nextensive piping system to ensure\
    \ comprehensive irrigation coverage and used pumps to spray high-pressure \nwater\
    \ onto the air [48]. The advantage of sprinkler is that it minimizes runoff, is\
    \ suitable for all types of soil, and has \na water-saving rate of between 30\
    \ - 50%. Sprinkles can be mixed with fertilizer solutions and used in close \n\
    cropping and high plant population [28]. However, this method has high operating\
    \ costs for cleaning sprinkler \nnozzles and maintaining high-pressure pumps and\
    \ pipes. In addition, sprinkler irrigation is unsuitable for use in \nwindy areas\
    \ because wind gusts and evapotranspiration cause high water loss rates. Moreover,\
    \ regular \nmaintenance of the pipes and their connections to avoid leaks or clogs\
    \ can reduce the water spray pressure, \nreducing water distribution to the plants\
    \ [37, 48]. \n3.2 \nDrip Irrigation \nIn drip irrigation, the water source moistens\
    \ the soil or planting media through the holes in the pipes and flows \nthrough\
    \ a hose connected to the emitter with low pressure. The focus of water droplets\
    \ is a small part of the soil or \ngrowing medium that covers the root zone by\
    \ adjusting it to get water droplets [49]. Drip irrigation is the most \nefficient\
    \ irrigation because it can distribute water and nutrients simultaneously to the\
    \ root zone, which results in \nbetter nutrient uptake. Due to the circulation\
    \ of water in the roots through the capillary principle, the pores of the \nsoil\
    \ or planting medium remain dry so that air circulation is maintained and soil\
    \ moisture is at field capacity. \nProduces a root zone capable of breathing more\
    \ intensely during its growth cycle [25, 37, 50]. \nDrip irrigation uses dripping\
    \ water delivered at a rate of between 2 - 20 liters per hour. The application\
    \ of this \nmethod is to place an emitter on each plant. It is suitable for use\
    \ on vegetables and fruit, but farmers usually only \nconsider high-value plants\
    \ because the investment value is relatively high [37, 49]. This method supports\
    \ various \ntypes of soil by adjusting the speed of water application. Hefty porous\
    \ sandy soils need a fast drip-rate; conversely, \nclay soil needs a slow drip\
    \ rate to avoid water logging and runoff [25, 37]. \n4 MONITORING AND CONTROLLING\
    \ STRATEGIES \nA total of 30 papers were used to examine the irrigation system's\
    \ monitoring and control method. These \npublications provide ways for regulating\
    \ irrigation by employing sensors to measure changes in microclimate, water \n\
    quality, and soil moisture values. The paper's distribution is represented in\
    \ Figure 3 below. \nAn effective and efficient monitoring system is needed to\
    \ collect different plant growth parameters. Monitoring in an \nintelligent irrigation\
    \ system involves collecting data representing the latest microclimate data and\
    \ water and soil \nconditions around the irrigation area through a microcontroller\
    \ connected to the IoT [51], shown in Figure 4. The \ndevelopment of real-time\
    \ monitoring devices was made possible due to the rapid development of microcontrollers\
    \ \nand sensors, low-cost hardware (Arduino UNO, ESP8266, Raspberry Pi), and fast\
    \ internet, which enhanced the \nperformance of monitoring and control systems\
    \ [17, 52]. There are two types of internet connections: wired and \nwireless;\
    \ Wired connections make the internet connection stable, but with fixed hardware\
    \ location. Wireless \nconnection makes flexible hardware placement but has signal\
    \ interference [53]. \n \n660 \nIrfan Ardiansah, et al. - An overview of IOT based\

    \ \n \n \n \nFig 3. Distribution of papers on monitoring and controlling strategies\
    \ \n \nFig 4. Block diagram of IoT based Smart Farming \nAll devices and sensors\
    \ are connected directly to the server via a cabling system in a wired connection\
    \ case. This \nsystem is only effective when a few parameters are measured and\
    \ use a small greenhouse; it is crucial because \nthe more connected devices,\
    \ the more cables are used. So, the wired greenhouse system is not suitable for\
    \ large \nor commercial greenhouses. The advantage is that data transactions are\
    \ safe and have minimal interference [51, \n53, 54]. WSN is the latest technology\
    \ in intelligent farming that can be expanded and scaled up without modifying\
    \ \nthe greenhouse infrastructure. Its wireless form makes it easy to receive\
    \ and transmit data between nodes using \nlow-power frequencies. Unfortunately,\
    \ interference and signal loss are common problems because of the high \nfrequency\
    \ in the air. However, the increase in greenhouse size, the number of parameters,\
    \ sensors variety, node \nsize, and devices distant is not a problem because an\
    \ additional WSN only needs to be attached to an existing \nnetwork. Another advantage\
    \ is Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) technology, wirelessly connected sensor nodes\
    \ \nnetwork to sense and send various data, and extensible [36, 54, 55]. \nThe\
    \ implementation of WSN in agriculture itself is extensive, with sensors, RFID,\
    \ cameras, drones, and cloud \nservices connected seamlessly for data acquisition\
    \ and transmission. Cloud computing serves data collection and \nanalysis to generate\
    \ visualizations, decision support, and commands; system users (farmers or researchers)\
    \ can \nthen access data remotely via their devices to gain real-time insights\
    \ [19, 56]. Thus, monitoring and controlling the \nintelligent irrigation system\
    \ can be effective, efficient, convenient, and optimal yields. [55] proposed the\
    \ approach \nwith WSN and gateway node to collect soil moisture values in plants\
    \ by taking soil and cultivated plants images. \nThe challenges in building a\
    \ system that can accommodate these two technologies are sensor coverage, \ncommunication\
    \ between devices, computational process efficiency, and electricity usage. [57]\
    \ also offers UAVs for \naerial monitoring of vegetation and irrigation areas.\
    \ \nAppropriate control techniques in intelligent irrigation systems can increase\
    \ crop water supply precisely to improve \nthe efficiency of water use, energy\
    \ savings, harvest optimization, proper use of nutrients, and effective use of\
    \ labor. \n11\n5\n14\n0\n5\n10\n15\nMicroclimate\nWater Quality\nSoil Moisture\n\

    \ systems for greenhouse: recent trends and \nchallenges \n \nJournal of Applied\
    \ Engineering Science- Vol.20, No 3, 2022 -www.engineeringscience.rs \n \nTherefore,\
    \ a control system can manipulate several irrigation parameters, like air circulation,\
    \ air temperature, \nrelative humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation [58–60].\
    \ A technology that can analyze the surface temperature \nof agricultural land\
    \ without touching it using thermal imaging was proposed by [61] to determine\
    \ which areas of \nland are in dire need of water because the non-uniformity of\
    \ soil moisture can inhibit spinach growth. Studies by \n[56, 62–64] also state\
    \ that it is possible to use thermal imaging for nurseries, forecasting crop yields,\
    \ pest and \ndisease disturbances, maintenance of agricultural machinery, and\
    \ irrigation scheduling. \n4.1 \nMicroclimate based  \nMonitoring and controlling\
    \ the microclimate in the greenhouse is a critical factor to account for water\
    \ loss due to \nevaporation. Air temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation,\
    \ and wind speed need precision measurements to \nmeet crop water requirements\
    \ [30, 65]. The Raspberry Pi, various Arduino models, connected to WSN, and cloud\
    \ \nservers are popular hardware. WSN implementation is an efficient way to interconnect\
    \ various sensors placed far \napart in the greenhouse. The system performs accurate\
    \ system monitoring, collects data, and presents charts, and \ncontrol devices\
    \ are activated, referring to predefined threshold values compared with real-time\
    \ data [30, 36, 66]. \n[59] presented a technique for evaluating microclimate\
    \ parameters in two tropical greenhouses before planting \ntomatoes using LoRa\
    \ wireless and IoT sensors. The comfort ratio model (CftM) and scenario analysis\
    \ show that \nenvironmental conditions can adapt to the growth phase of tomato\
    \ plants. The microclimate before and during \nplanting was analyzed using the\
    \ Simulink app. Also, a study by [67] showed that a microclimate parameter \n\
    measurement device in a greenhouse could yield comprehensive data for temperature,\
    \ humidity, CO2 levels, \nlighting levels, soil moisture, acidity, irrigation\
    \ water conductivity, and airflow velocity. In winter, the greenhouse \nbehavior\
    \ was studied by [68] using fuzzy logic control (FLC) due to uncertainty in the\
    \ greenhouse environment. The \nfuzzy set was developed based on experts in greenhouse\
    \ thermal behavior. Fuzzy control manages decisions \nbased on weather forecasts\
    \ and user interactions. [54] also took a similar approach to measure leaf temperature,\
    \ \nair temperature, and soil moisture using three connected sensors to assess\
    \ the level of microclimate in a \ngreenhouse and use Zigbee to transmit sensor\
    \ data. \nControlling the microclimate in the greenhouse by using fan ventilation\
    \ and fan-pad ventilation can also be an \noption. This forced ventilation can\
    \ prevent plants from overheating even if the greenhouse does not use an \nevaporative\
    \ cooling system. Greenhouses can produce good harvests in the spring, and the\
    \ data show a \nrelationship between the greenhouse microclimate and water uptake\
    \ that minimizes drainage [69]. [70] built a \nmonitoring system using an open-source\
    \ platform to collect microclimate variables (air temperature, humidity, soil\
    \ \ntemperature, and soil moisture). Communication between devices uses Bluetooth\
    \ and obtain electricity supply \nthrough solar panels. [71] has proposed improvements\
    \ to the greenhouse IoT-based system by adding color \nspectrum monitoring using\
    \ a camera system to get photos of the plant canopies translated into color (RGB,\
    \ HSL, \nand brightness), plant texture, thermal (plant temperature), and plant\
    \ morphology. The system works with NFT to \nirrigate lettuce plants in the greenhouse,\
    \ automatically recording data and identifying plant stress levels. \n4.2 \nWater\
    \ Quality-based \nWater quality safety is a challenge in the 21st century because\
    \ of the many pollutants, which are predominantly \nartificial such as environmental\
    \ damage, packaging waste, or chemical waste. Overexploitation of natural \nresources,\
    \ rapid industrial development, and agricultural expansion are the leading causes\
    \ of the problem. [72]. \nWater quality is affected by direct and indirect sources\
    \ of pollution such as sewage, factory waste, agricultural and \nurban runoff.\
    \ The need for human involvement in water quality management is essential [73,\
    \ 74]. Water quality \nmanagement is a way to regularly collect water quality\
    \ information in a location to find out its current condition. \nWater quality\
    \ management aims to measure water quality variables such as microbial content\
    \ physical and \nchemical properties, provide an early warning system and provide\
    \ decision support for further treatment [75, 76]. \nWSN and IoT are inevitable\
    \ to manage variables over a wide area for larger areas such as lakes or oceans.\
    \ \n[75] has proposed a system that assesses irrigation water quality with IoT\
    \ by detecting potential hydrogen (pH), \nelectrical conductivity (EC), turbidity,\
    \ and salinity in real-time using different sensors to maintain plant health status.\
    \ \nAlso, [77] undertook a study to build a continuous water quality monitoring\
    \ system using open-source hardware \nand low-cost sensors. Preliminary results\
    \ show that the device can produce accurate results at a lower cost than \nexisting\
    \ technologies with proper calibration. \n4.3 \nSoil Moisture-based \nFarmers\
    \ need to consider soil conditions because moist soil means the plant still has\
    \ enough water for growth [11]. \nMonitoring soil moisture content becomes vital\
    \ as the basis for irrigation scheduling. Raspberry Pi and Arduino \nUNO have\
    \ commonly used devices in developing low-cost IoT-based soil moisture management\
    \ interfaced using \nvarious sensors [30, 60, 75]. The sensor used is a capacitive\
    \ type and transmits electricity without conduction; it \ncan measure soil moisture\
    \ changes by planting them into the soil and measuring its volumetric water content.\
    \ The \nTime Domain Reflectometry (TDR) sensor is a more precise option for measuring\
    \ soil moisture, consisting of two \nmetal rods embedded at the depth at which\
    \ the humidity is to be measured. Works by sending pulses to the soil \nand then\
    \ calculating the response of the soil as soil moisture content. Due to its good\
    \ quality in measuring soil \nmoisture, this TDR sensor is quite expensive to\
    \ use in large-scale greenhouses [78, 79]. \n662 \nIrfan Ardiansah, et al. - An\

    \ trends \nand challenges \n \nJournal of Applied Engineering Science - Vol.20,\
    \ No 3, 2022 - www.engineeringscience.rs \n \n \n[80] proposed a soil moisture\
    \ control system for measuring water content in soil at different soil depths,\
    \ soil types, \nand air temperatures using various sensors integrated with Arduino\
    \ UNO. The ESP8266 wireless module is then \nlinked to the Arduino to upload data\
    \ to the cloud server. A similar study by [81] succeeded in developing an IoT-\n\
    based field control system integrated with cloud-based data monitoring and analysis.\
    \ The analysis results help \npredict water consumption for better crop yields.\
    \ [82] approach to controlling soil moisture uses wireless technology \nutilizing\
    \ GSM networks and push notifications to automate water supply for plants. A system\
    \ proposed by [83] \npresents an Android application-based humidity monitoring\
    \ method, where an Arduino interface sensor connected \nto Wi-Fi sends state data\
    \ to a smartphone. Another monitoring approach is carried out by [60] using IoT\
    \ and soil \nnutrient sensors to detect nutrient adequacy for plants. The decision\
    \ support system then receives the data \nparameters and processes them as a farming\
    \ decision. \n[84] implemented a user-friendly system, representing the soil moisture\
    \ level with colors. These colors have helped \nfarmers visually identify and\
    \ manage soil moisture content without understanding the values displayed. Likewise,\
    \ \n[85] proposed a soil nutrient control system that can manage the concentration\
    \ of nutrients in the soil by planting \nsensors in the soil to map nutrient variability.\
    \ Also, [86] developed an innovative device that uses a camera-\nintegrated drone\
    \ for field mapping. Images are analyzed to generate soil moisture and nutrient\
    \ values and use \nthem for irrigation planning and scheduling. \n5 ARTIFICIAL\
    \ INTELLIGENCE IN IRRIGATION SYSTEM \nArtificial intelligence in intelligent irrigation\
    \ systems was the subject of 25 papers. These studies concentrate on \ndeveloping\
    \ decision support systems, fuzzy logic models, and artificial neural network\
    \ models that can take \ndecisions automatically in response to changes in field\
    \ conditions. The distribution of articles based on the theme \nof artificial\
    \ intelligence is shown in Figure 5 below. \n \nFig 5. Distribution of papers\
    \ on artificial intelligence in irrigation system \nArtificial intelligence (AI)\
    \ is a branch of science concerned with creating machines that can understand\
    \ and act in \nthe same way as humans. Machine learning is a burgeoning sub-domain\
    \ of AI that explores patterns in large \namounts of data [58, 87]. The popularity\
    \ of machine learning is due to more and more data generated by various \napplications\
    \ and IoT. The system can generate helpful information for making decisions or\
    \ becoming input to other \nsystems by studying data patterns. The need for agricultural\
    \ products is directly proportional to the increase in the \nearth's population,\
    \ so agroindustry and innovative agriculture technology get the spotlight in the\
    \ industrial revolution \n4.0 [16, 46].  \nAI has the potential to solve nonlinear,\
    \ multiparameter, and time-varying problems in managing intelligent irrigation\
    \ \nsystems. By applying AI algorithms to specific problem areas, the system tries\
    \ to imitate human logic, thought \nprocesses, and decision making through the\
    \ application of Fuzzy Logic, Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest \nNeighbor\
    \ (kNN), Decision Tree and Random Forest by using past data to feed AI and provides\
    \ new knowledge to \nthe system [58, 61]. [88] has researched by applying different\
    \ regression and machine learning algorithms to \nseveral sensor datasets to develop\
    \ weekly irrigation plan predictions. \nA study implementing an intelligent irrigation\
    \ system shows many advantages, such as minimizing soil stress to \nchanging microclimate\
    \ conditions, efficient water use, and reducing human interaction. This solar\
    \ panel-powered \nsystem has a Sensor Layer, Central Layer, and Valve Layer running\
    \ together. The function of the Central Layer is \nto control the process that\
    \ produces input (sensor layer detects moisture content) and output (valve layer\
    \ opens to \nprovide water). The system also enables fertilizers and pesticides\
    \ by calibrating other sensors according to the \nrequired input [89]. \n5.1 \n\

    \ where the decision support system (DSS) comes in [76, 90]. DSS \nhas a framework\
    \ that can represent complex systems with an efficient and robust approach that\
    \ is easy to \nunderstand generates additional information and new perspectives\
    \ to improve the quality of irrigation management. \nDSS is an information system\
    \ that analyzes data and represents it to make decisions quickly. The primary\
    \ purpose \nof DSS is to support and improve decision-making [28, 76]. Figure\
    \ 6 shows a DSS logic diagram that consists of \nfour connected components: Database,\
    \ model base, knowledge base, and user interface. \n \nFig 6. Block diagram of\
    \ Decision Support System \nThe Database in irrigation DSS collects and manages\
    \ air temperature, relative humidity, crop water requirements, \nirrigation records,\
    \ and solar radiation. The knowledge base has three parts: fact base, rule base,\
    \ and inference \nengine used to analyze data, solve uncertain problems and draw\
    \ conclusions. The model base creates optimization \nmodels, integrates numerous\
    \ decision models, analyzes them to create crop water simulations, and offers\
    \ farmers \nirrigation scheduling. [71, 76]. \nDeveloping and utilizing a decision\
    \ support system in irrigation management is essential for scheduling water \n\
    delivery based on crop needs. The main problem is how moist the soil is and how\
    \ much water the plants need \nbased on the type of plant, planting technique,\
    \ availability of water, amount of fertilizer applied, microclimate \nconditions,\
    \ and stage of plant development [91]. With DSS, farmers can manage their farms\
    \ daily using plant \ndatabases and water supply strategies to perform irrigation\
    \ calculations and fertilization adjustments to obtain \noptimal yields. There\
    \ are times when a system has a crop suggestion feature that advises farmers to\
    \ plant a crop \nthat yields the highest profit under certain constraints [92].\
    \ \nThe problem is that the characteristics of crops, soils, and microclimatic\
    \ conditions in agriculture are dynamic and \nnot linear, varying with seasons.\
    \ Therefore, setting the proper irrigation schedule will directly influence plant\
    \ growth. \nThe core of DSS includes monitoring different parameters using different\
    \ sensors and configuring their rules. DSS \nmanages sensor readings stored in\
    \ the cloud to adjust irrigation scheduling to maintain irrigation system efficiency\
    \ \nroutinely [76, 90]. An intelligent irrigation DSS must have the ability to\
    \ adapt to changes in transient and spatial \nplant dynamics, such as uncertainties\
    \ in microclimate conditions, nutrient requirements, and environmental \nchanges.\
    \ Researchers have proposed many studies on DSS applied to irrigation systems,\
    \ such as [93], who \ndeveloped an automated irrigation system using a single\
    \ lateral pipe covering a large area to manage water at \nvarying speeds. \nSprinkler\
    \ irrigation developed by [94] uses an automatic linear moving sprinkler system\
    \ with WSN based DSS. The \nsystem can adapt to crop types, irrigation requirements,\
    \ and planting locations to command individual sprinkler \nheads how and where\
    \ water must be applied. Similarly, [76] built a DSS integrated fertigation simulator\
    \ for \ndesigning drip or sprinkler irrigation for on-site olives and grapes farms.\
    \ The system has a database, simulation \nmodel, and user interface that shows\
    \ the ranking of design alternatives through multicriteria decision-making \n\
    (MCDM). The scope of the calculation of this system includes land analysis, water\
    \ requirements, and plant \nnutrition. \n664 \nIrfan Ardiansah, et al. - An overview\

    \ model is a data-driven technique with easy-to-understand logical rules. [50,\
    \ 68, 95] proposed a fuzzy \nlogic-based irrigation scheduling by enforcing control\
    \ rules to microclimate data, evaporation data, and soil \nconditions. The process\
    \ flow can be seen in Figure 7. \n[96] succeeded in building and testing a rule-based\
    \ Fuzzy Logic application to assess the water stress index of \nplants in a greenhouse;\
    \ the application accepts three input variables, namely air temperature, solar\
    \ radiation, and \nwater pressure. Results show that Fuzzy Logic eliminates the\
    \ need for air aerodynamic resistance data, making \nthis system more straightforward.\
    \ \n[95] developed fuzzy logic using the LabVIEW application to create a graphical\
    \ user interface (GUI) for a drip \nirrigation control system in a greenhouse.\
    \ The input parameters used are air temperature and soil moisture and \nprocess\
    \ them using fuzzy rules to produce information of irrigation duration. The test\
    \ results show that fuzzy logic \ncontrol can efficiently estimate irrigation\
    \ schedules in an automated system, and greenhouse managers can \nmonitor real-time\
    \ data and devices that are easy to manage, even for ordinary users. [97] research\
    \ also designed \nan irrigation control based on fuzzy logic applying the Penman-Monteith\
    \ equation for rice cultivation with a \nparameter model in the difference between\
    \ actual and target evapotranspiration following the plant growth phase. \nEach\
    \ phase has its water requirement. The research aims to develop an intelligent\
    \ system that helps irrigation \nmanagement and produces a system that can work\
    \ better than conventional irrigation systems. The results showed \nthat the control\
    \ system saves water, improves irrigation performance, improves crop quality,\
    \ and saves labor.  \n \nFig 7. Fuzzy Logic-based Intelligent Irrigation System\
    \ \nAlso, [50] developed a fuzzy logic system that evaluates the irrigation system\
    \ based on the variable availability of \nirrigation water during the planting\
    \ period on the level of farmers' income which results in the efficiency of the\
    \ \nirrigation system performance. To assist in making decisions on irrigation\
    \ distribution. [98] conducted similar \nresearch by developing an intelligent\
    \ irrigation system to turn on and off the irrigation system using input \nparameters\
    \ of water use, water and air temperature, and soil moisture. They implement WSN-based\
    \ monitoring to \nsend data on fuzzy logic, which then performs irrigation scheduling\
    \ by applying fuzzy rules. The system can \nmaintain soil moisture content at\
    \ the specified limit to save the use of electrical energy, water, and runoff.\
    \ \n5.3 \nArtificial Neural Network Model \nOne application of AI in agriculture\
    \ is Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) algorithms, which can predict using elements\
    \ \ninterconnected and work in parallel. The advantage of neural networks is that\
    \ they can be trained, for example, to \ndistinguish grass from rice or to compare\
    \ tomatoes to peppers [71]. The ANN system can predict with high \naccuracy when\
    \ fed reliable and precise data. A trained ANN is considered an expert in a category\
    \ of data. This \nexpert can then predict possible future conditions and prepare\
    \ what-if scenarios [73, 87]. Other advantages of ANN \nare (1) Adaptive learning,\
    \ the ability to learn and carry out tasks based on the data provided, (2) Self-organization,\
    \ \nthe system can independently compile and build information representations\
    \ during the learning process, and (3) \nReal-time operations, computations are\
    \ carried out in parallel, so it is faster to get calculation results [99]. \n\
    The ANN model is a simple model consisting of three primary neurons distributed\
    \ in the input layer, multiples of the \nhidden layer, and the output layer. ANN\
    \ development requires necessary basic steps, namely datasets, ANN \nmodel training\
    \ data, and ANN model test data for evaluation. Using quality data, the ANN model\
    \ has a mechanism \nfor self-study and solving complex problems. Input neurons\

    \ linear and \nnonlinear functions [26, 87, 99, 100]. \nThe following Figure 8\
    \ shows the ANN process flow. In general, the use of ANN includes problem-solving\
    \ in system \noptimization, process control, pattern classification, forecasting,\
    \ and prediction. The main components of an ANN \nmodel consist of neuron nodes,\
    \ a hidden layer containing weights between parameters and distribution rules\
    \ to \ngenerate information for learning rules and independent learning skills\
    \ through experience. There are two types of \nANN models based on their input\
    \ choices: feed-forward and feed-backward networks [99]. \n \nFig 8. The flow\
    \ of feed-forward artificial neurons \nEvapotranspiration is essential information\
    \ that needs to be known to optimize plant growth, especially in water \nmanagement\
    \ and sustainable irrigation systems. Knowledge of the parameters of air temperature,\
    \ relative \nhumidity, wind speed, hours of sunshine, and latitude can optimize\
    \ the management of ET0 in a greenhouse [97]. \nANN research on intelligent irrigation\
    \ systems is applied to scheduling and irrigation discharge to achieve savings\
    \ \nin irrigation water use. [87] conducted a study to estimate the value of soil\
    \ moisture in rice farming land using \nminimal micro and macro climate data by\
    \ applying two ANN models. The first model predicts the value of ET0 \nusing the\
    \ minimum, maximum and average air temperature variables. The second model does\
    \ the same thing but \nuses air temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation.\
    \ The test results show that both models produce reliable and \naccurate soil\
    \ moisture estimates. \nA study by [101] has developed an ANN model to calculate\
    \ evapotranspiration (ET0). After testing, they concluded \nthat the ANN model\
    \ predicts evapotranspiration better than the conventional ET0 equation. Similarly,\
    \ [90] \ndeveloped an ANN to calculate ET0 and compared it with the Penman-FAO\
    \ equation and Penman-Monteith model \nusing four and six microclimate variables\
    \ as inputs. The test indicates that the three models provide accurate \nresults\
    \ using six input parameters. In contrast, the test results with four parameters\
    \ show that only the ANN model \ncan accurately predict the ET0 value. This research\
    \ shows that building an ANN model is possible even with limited \nmicroclimate\
    \ data.  \nIn addition, irrigation control system automation was also proposed\
    \ by [102] using the ANN cluster and closed-loop \ncontrol, which resulted in\
    \ better performance than time-based irrigation control. However, they did not\
    \ provide \ninformation regarding the irrigation method used and the percentage\
    \ of water savings. [100] developed an \nintelligent irrigation system for evapotranspiration\
    \ using the ANN model and a photovoltaic system to predict \nirrigation scheduling\
    \ based on cropping moisture distribution data; this study reported better daily\
    \ water and \nelectrical energy savings also better crop yields. The application\
    \ of ANN in irrigation water management has also \ndiscussed prediction of water\
    \ salinity, water quality, rain runoff, and forecasting of surface irrigation\
    \ infiltration,  \n[73] proposed two ANN models to predict Biochemical Oxygen\
    \ Demand (BOD) and Dissolved Oxygen (DO) for \nirrigation water originating from\
    \ rivers; the conclusion is that water quality management in other areas can also\
    \ use \nthis ANN model. Similarly, [103] uses the ANN model to design an intelligent\
    \ system to manage water systems for \nagriculture and fisheries. [104] explained\
    \ that the greenhouse environment has dynamic and complex \ncharacteristics, making\
    \ it difficult to use conventional control methods as a solution. Radial Basis\
    \ Function Neural \nNetworks (RBF) algorithm and nonlinear adaptive controllers\
    \ become solutions to control greenhouse microclimate. \n[74] discusses the use\
    \ of ANN in drip irrigation systems to predict the distribution of subsurface\
    \ irrigation water. \nThe development of the ANN is to model the continuous wetting\
    \ pattern after the water droplets from the emitter \ntouch the ground surface.\
    \ \n6 FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES \nThis review explored the various studies\
    \ and progress to improve irrigation water use efficiency, nutrient \noptimization,\
    \ and crop yields. The aim is to improve and increase food availability by implementing\
    \ IoT-based \nmonitoring and control on agricultural land, especially greenhouses.\
    \ The review results show that researchers and \n666 \nIrfan Ardiansah, et al.\

    \ trends \nand challenges \n \nJournal of Applied Engineering Science - Vol.20,\
    \ No 3, 2022 - www.engineeringscience.rs \n \n \nfarmers can maximize the use\
    \ of the latest IoT technologies for environmental conditions monitoring, data-driven\
    \ \ncontrol, and artificial intelligence. Nowadays, there is an increase in research\
    \ that develops techniques and models \nfor developing irrigation control systems.\
    \ The trend is due to the emergence of various sensors and controls on the \n\
    market; this provides vast opportunities for the development of precision agriculture,\
    \ especially for making \nintelligent predictions of agricultural processes such\
    \ as crop yields, crop water requirements, and microclimate \nconditions. Researchers\
    \ also need to explore other factors that influence irrigation scheduling planning,\
    \ especially \nin large agricultural areas, because researchers generally conduct\
    \ studies on a laboratory scale. Research from \ndifferent perspectives will enrich\
    \ intelligent irrigation systems and result in inaccurate predictions that can\
    \ advise \nfarmers regarding their farming activities and notify them when anomalies\
    \ occur. \nFurthermore, researchers need to test various control systems in the\
    \ irrigation systems discussed, focus on \nadaptive control, and combine it with\
    \ real-time monitoring. It is essential to build systems that can adapt to dynamic\
    \ \nparameters of microclimate, soil, and plant. At the same time, ensure the\
    \ intelligent irrigation system runs optimally. \nIn addition, it is essential\
    \ to develop intelligent irrigation systems that are increasingly complex and\
    \ digital-based so \nthat the technology is suitable, affordable, and stable for\
    \ smallholders. The hope is to increase water use efficiency \nand solve water\
    \ scarcity. \n7 CONCLUSION \nLimited water has become the biggest challenge for\
    \ farmers, and efficiency must solve water scarcity in irrigation \nmanagement.\
    \ The main objective is to control the amount and frequency of irrigation so that\
    \ the amount of water \nreceived by plants is sufficient to keep the root zone\
    \ moist. Farmers who are generally ignorant about the \ncomplexity of optimal\
    \ irrigation management need a system that can facilitate big data processing\
    \ analysis tools \nand transmit quality information quickly and efficiently. The\
    \ system must be able to provide recommendations \naccording to the conditions\
    \ of the agricultural environment to increase the experience and decision-making\
    \ of \nfarmers. \nThis problem challenges researchers to increase efforts to develop\
    \ sophisticated monitoring and control strategies \nfor intelligent farming that\
    \ minimize irrigation water use. This review draws on previous relevant studies\
    \ on \nagriculture water saving. The review results describe research trends in\
    \ intelligent irrigation systems monitoring \nand control strategies and assess\
    \ research opportunities to ensure water availability and savings. We hope this\
    \ \nreview provides insight and inspiration for researchers to continue research\
    \ on irrigation monitoring and control to \nachieve food security and water savings.\

    Abstract: The inclusion of the Internet of Things (IoT) in greenhouses has become\
    \ a fundamental\ntool for improving cultivation systems, offering information\
    \ relevant to the greenhouse manager for\ndecision making in search of optimum\
    \ yield. This article presents a monitoring system applied to an\naeroponic greenhouse\
    \ based on an IoT architecture that provides user information on the status of\
    \ the\nclimatic variables and the appearance of the crop in addition to managing\
    \ the irrigation timing and\nthe frequency of visual inspection using an application\
    \ developed for Android mobile devices called\nAeroponics Monitor. The proposed\
    \ IoT architecture consists of four layers: a device layer, fog layer,\ncloud\
    \ layer and application layer. Once the information about the monitored variables\
    \ is obtained by\nthe sensors of the device layer, the fog layer processes it\
    \ and transfers it to the Thingspeak and Firebase\nservers. In the cloud layer,\
    \ Thingspeak analyzes the information from the variables monitored in\nthe greenhouse\
    \ through its IoT analytic tools to generate historical data and visualizations\
    \ of their\nbehavior, as well as an analysis of the system’s operating status.\
    \ Firebase, on the other hand, is used as\na database to store the results of\
    \ the processing of the images taken in the fog layer for the supervision\nof\
    \ the leaves and roots. The results of the analysis of the information of the\
    \ monitored variables and\nof the processing of the images are presented in the\
    \ developed app, with the objective of visualizing\nthe state of the crop and\
    \ to know the function of the monitoring system in the event of a possible lack\n\
    of electricity or a service line failure in the fog layer and to avoid the loss\
    \ of information. With the\ninformation about the temperature of the plant leaf\
    \ and the relative humidity inside the greenhouse,\nthe vapor pressure deﬁcit\
    \ (VPD) in the cloud layer is calculated; the VPD values are available on the\n\
    Thingspeak server and in the developed app. Additionally, an analysis of the VPD\
    \ is presented that\ndemonstrates a water deﬁciency from the transplanting of\
    \ the seedling to the cultivation chamber.\nThe IoT architecture presented in\
    \ this paper represents a potential tool for the study of aeroponic\nfarming systems\
    \ through IoT-assisted monitoring.\nKeywords: aeroponic; greenhouse; Internet\

    1. Introduction\nThe fundamental resources for traditional agriculture are farmland,\
    \ soil and water.\nConventional greenhouses require colossal infrastructures,\
    \ having among their limitations\nuncontrolled environments, smaller farmland,\
    \ plant diseases, soil degradation and a lack\nof resources, among others, leading\
    \ to reduced crop production [1]. With the increasing de-\nmand for food, the\
    \ role of agriculture demands the efﬁcient use of resources and increased\nSensors\

    Sensors 2022, 22, 5646\n2 of 28\nproduction. An option to improve farming systems\
    \ focuses on stress monitoring and\nstress-causing factors in cultivation [2].\
    \ Consequently, various technologies have emerged\nfor the conservation and use\
    \ of water and energy, in addition to the beneﬁts in increasing\nthe production\
    \ of multiple crops. Among the technologies that have had the most impact\nare\
    \ wireless sensor networks (WSN), computing in the cloud, fog computing, embedded\n\
    systems, big data, machine–machine (M2M) and human–machine communication (H2M),\n\
    communication protocols, application programming interfaces (API), and advanced\
    \ en-\ncryption standards (AES), as well as the use of geo-location, satellites\
    \ and servers, among\nothers [3].\nIn Mexico, it is necessary to increase agricultural\
    \ production by at least 70% by 2050,\nincreasing surface yield and reducing the\
    \ amount of water consumed [4]. Recently, organi-\nzations such as the Secretaría\
    \ de Agricultura y Desarrollo Rural, the Consejo Nacional de\nCiencia y Tecnología\
    \ (Conacyt) and the Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones Forestales,\nAgrícolas\
    \ y Pecuarias (INIFAP) have agreed on the collaboration on and transfer of technol-\n\
    ogy for cultivation in soil for semi-arid areas [5]. As time goes by, climate\
    \ change and water\nscarcity drive national and international organizations to\
    \ generate strategies to increase\ncrop yield by making the most of water despite\
    \ climatic adversities.\nAeroponics is a vertical cultivation method in which\
    \ the plant grows suspended over\na container, while a mist of nutrients is applied\
    \ to the roots inside a protection chamber [6].\nThe nutrient solution is atomized\
    \ on the root surface; for this, a pump is used that is in\ncharge of the oxygen\
    \ level in the root zone [7]. Since the nutrient solution is recirculated\nin\
    \ the aeroponic cultivation technique, it is important to regularly measure and\
    \ readjust\nthe pH value and electrical conductivity (EC) to have a successful\
    \ growth of the plant. If\nthe pH and EC readings are not at the proper level,\
    \ the cultivator should adjust the acidity\nand electroconductivity in the nutritious\
    \ solution so that each crop has speciﬁc EC and pH\nlevels; for example, the optimal\
    \ EC and pH values for growing onions, cucumbers, carrots,\nlettuce, tomatoes\
    \ and potatoes are between 1.5 to 2.5 ds m−1 and 5.5 to 6.5, respectively [8].\n\
    The pH and EC of a nutrient solution may be reduced due to environmental factors\n\
    such as high temperatures causing water evaporation or the absorption of nutrients\
    \ by\nplants [9]. In traditional soilless cultivation systems, such as hydroponics,\
    \ where the EC and\npH correction is performed manually, monitoring the temperature\
    \ of the nutrient solution\nis sorely needed since the results of the conductivity\
    \ and pH are directly inﬂuenced by this\nparameter [10]. The lifetime of the solution\
    \ is of the utmost importance and will depend\non timely adjustments made to the\
    \ pH, electrical conductivity and water level. To exclude\nchanges in the nutrient\
    \ solution, the volume level in the storage tank must remain constant,\nreplenishing\
    \ the water absorbed by the plants and lost by evapotranspiration, otherwise,\n\
    the concentration of the salts will change, affecting the healthy growth of the\
    \ plants [11].\nThe practice of aeroponics is adaptable in areas where the soil\
    \ is not suitable for growth\nof the plants, presenting advantages such as: a\
    \ reduction in the cost of labor, savings in\nwater of up to 98%, 60% in fertilizers\
    \ and 10% in pesticides and herbicides, and maximizing\nthe yield of the plant\
    \ to between 45% and 75% compared to geoponic or hydroponic\nsystems [8]. In comparison\
    \ to cultivation techniques such as hydroponics and substrate,\naeroponics has\
    \ revealed a signiﬁcant increment in root length, area, volume and network\nperimeter\
    \ [12,13]. With respect to traditional agriculture, in aeroponics increments of\
    \ 57%,\n42% and 400% in the number of leaves, diameter of the leaves and root\
    \ growth, respectively,\nconsidering a temperature inside the greenhouse between\
    \ 8 ◦C and 44 ◦C and a relative\nhumidity between 10% and 94%, have been observed\
    \ [14].\nOn the other hand, in Mexico, 59.5% of the population has access to the\
    \ Internet,\nwhich enables a high percentage of people to use and develop Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT)\ntechnologies to improve the use of resources in agricultural\
    \ crops [15]. Having described\nthe above, assisted aeroponics with IoT tools\
    \ appears to be a very attractive alternative to\nobtain crops of greater quantity\
    \ and quality. One of the main challenges in aeroponics is to\ndetermine the atomization\
    \ time and time interval in irrigation according to the needs of\neach plant [8].\
    \ To avoid a signiﬁcant decrease in plant growth and reduction in crop yield,\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 5646\n3 of 28\nit is crucial to determine the threshold level\
    \ to which each plant can be subjected under\nconditions of irrigation deﬁciency\
    \ [16].\nWhen a crop is under water stress, the root of the plant begins to turn\
    \ dark, increasing\nits temperature. An indirect way to detect crop water needs\
    \ is through changes in crop\ntemperature and transpiration by measuring the crop\
    \ water stress index (CWSI) [17],\nevapotranspiration (ET) [18], temperature difference\
    \ between the environment and the\nleaf [19] and, recently, through the vapor\
    \ pressure deﬁcit (VPD) [20]. In arid and semi-arid\nregions, a crop is under\
    \ water stress when the leaf temperature exceeds the air temperature\nfrom 4 ◦C\
    \ to 6 ◦C; likewise, a crop does not present water stress when the temperature\n\
    of the leaf is from 1 ◦C to 4 ◦C below the air temperature [21]. The water stress\
    \ index\ncan be calculated empirically by measuring the difference in temperature\
    \ between the\nenvironment and the crop and normalizing it with respect to the\
    \ differences between a\nhumid crop due to high transpiration and a crop with\
    \ low humidity due to the absence\nof moisture, or theoretically through the measurement\
    \ of solar radiation, temperature\nand humidity in the environment and the temperature\
    \ of the crop [22]. VPD and the\nchange in the temperature difference with plant\
    \ transpiration can be measured through\nleaf temperature, environmental temperature\
    \ and relative humidity [23].\nEvapotranspiration can be averaged through different\
    \ methods, with the Penman—\nMonteith method being the most globally accepted;\
    \ however, for this estimation the\nmeasurement of temperature, solar radiation,\
    \ relative humidity, wind speed, atmospheric\npressure and steam pressure saturation\
    \ is required [24].\nRelated to the transpiration of a growing crop, the transpiration\
    \ rate of a crop varies\naccording to changes in atmospheric conditions, and one\
    \ of the special factors is the VPD.\nA high VPD causes an increase in the rate\
    \ of transpiration and therefore an excessive\nconsumption of water and the photosynthetic\
    \ limitation of the crop. A VPD above 1 kPa is\npotentially harmful, producing\
    \ a reduction in stomatal conductance, making photosynthe-\nsis impossible and\
    \ generating water stress even if the roots of the crop are well irrigated [20].\n\
    Reports of consecutive trials have recently been presented on crops on substrate\
    \ applied to\nSalanova lettuce considering controlled environments in light intensity\
    \ and temperature to\nmodify the relative humidity and achieve a VPD of 0.7 kPa\
    \ and 1.7 kPa during the growth\ncycle [20], following the methodology described\
    \ in [25]. In these, it was found that the\nplant area was signiﬁcantly greater\
    \ in the crop developed with a low VPD. Other studies in\ntomato cultivation show\
    \ that a low VPD moderates water stress, regulating the photosyn-\nthetic limitations\
    \ of the plant and reducing the cumulative water consumption regardless\nof soil\
    \ water status [26]. The ﬁne regulation of and the decrease in VPD ﬂuctuations\
    \ are also\ncrucial to produce a better crop growth since maintaining the photosynthetic\
    \ performance\nof the plant leads to the leaf expansion being maintained and a\
    \ higher yield being produced\nwith high nutrition values [27]. In soil tomato\
    \ cultivation systems, the applicability of IoT\nsensors was demonstrated to study\
    \ the variations in the parameters of temperature, relative\nhumidity and VPD\
    \ [28]. Signiﬁcant deviations from optimal climatic conditions due to\nimprecise\
    \ heating and cooling systems used in commercial greenhouses were revealed in\n\
    this study.\nTo address water stress, techniques based on temperature measurement\
    \ from infrared\nsensors [23] and thermographic cameras have been used in the\
    \ literature [29]. When using a\nthermal imager, a common technique for segmenting\
    \ vegetative content is the simultaneous\ncapture of visible spectrum (RGB) and\
    \ multispectral images to determine the threshold of\ncolor components, generating\
    \ a binary mask that will cover the thermal image and will\nshow only the information\
    \ of the vegetative components [29].\nIn aeroponics systems, the root development\
    \ process is crucial for the plant’s growth\nperformance. In order to optimize\
    \ the plant’s aerial parts in aeroponic culture, the appropri-\nate value deﬁnition\
    \ of irrigation water pressure, droplet size and fogging interval is needed\n\
    to improve the continuous water and nutrient availability [30,31]. Recently, non-invasive\n\
    monitoring systems have been proposed for the study of vegetative growth parameters\
    \ in\nroots and leaves developed in greenhouses [31].\nSensors 2022, 22, 5646\n\
    4 of 28\nImplementing and promoting the initial conditions for a healthy crop,\
    \ using IoT-\nbased technologies, requires monitoring devices with capabilities\
    \ to acquire and analyze\nenvironmental, nutritional and crop data. In order to\
    \ develop studies on soilless cultivation\nand determine better cultivation practices,\
    \ monitoring of and controlling the main sensors\nand actuators involved in the\
    \ aeroponic cultivation system are needed. The purpose of\nstudy in this paper\
    \ is to determine the feasibility of integrating intelligent sensors, for the\n\
    measurement of climatic conditions in the environment and crops as well as providing\n\
    nutrient solutions, that allow favorable conditions for crop growth in aeroponic\
    \ systems\nwith IoT-based technologies. Considered variables for our proposal\
    \ are temperature and\nrelative humidity both in the greenhouse and in the plant\
    \ leaf, VPD and luminosity, as well\nas the level, temperature, pH and EC in the\
    \ nutrient solution tanks.\nThe proposed system presents the analysis of the information\
    \ acquired by the sensors,\nthe operating status of each of the elements incorporated\
    \ in the platform using IoT analytics\nThingspeak tools, as well as the initial\
    \ preprocessing of the images acquired in the inspection\nfrom the leaf and root.\
    \ Once the plant has been transplanted to the cultivation chamber,\nthe plant\
    \ must adapt to the deﬁned irrigation scheme during the ﬁrst week; therefore,\
    \ the\noperation of each component incorporated in the proposed monitoring system\
    \ is veriﬁed\nin the same period.\nFor the experimentation, Batavia lettuce was\
    \ chosen because its duration of the cultiva-\ntion process is relatively short\
    \ compared to other crops. The monitoring system incorporates\nthe use of an application\
    \ for mobile devices capable of showing records and visualizations\nfrom the analysis\
    \ of information acquired by the built-in sensors and processed by the IoT\nanalytics\
    \ Thingspeak tools; in addition, the app records the measurements of the environ-\n\
    mental conditions, the status and readjustment of the pH and EC of the nutrient\
    \ solution,\naccess to the irrigation controls and the recirculation and the mixer\
    \ of the system.\nAdditionally, the platform has a standard thermographic camera\
    \ (8–14 µm); each of\nits captured images are transferred to the platform through\
    \ an SMB server, which allows\nthem to be viewed in the Aeroponics Monitor application.\
    \ The Aeroponics Monitor was\ndeveloped as a remote viewing and administration\
    \ tool that allows users to modify the\natomization time and the hours for the\
    \ visual inspection of the crop, as well as the turning\non and off of the sprinklers,\
    \ the recirculation system and the mixture of nutrient solution,\nas well as maintenance\
    \ tasks of the full system. The main advantages addressed by the\nproposal presented\
    \ in this study are the remote administration of system actuators, the\nmonitoring\
    \ of each of the sensors incorporated in the greenhouse, the remote capture of\n\
    images of the crops and the visualization of historical variables and data reports\
    \ on the\noperation of each of the processes that are incorporated in the monitoring\
    \ system, with all\nthe above carried out through an application for Android mobile\
    \ devices.\nThis document is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a literature\

    \ Review\n2.1. Agriculture-Oriented IoT Architectures\nThere are multiple proposals\
    \ in the literature referring to IoT architectures used in\nintelligent agriculture;\
    \ among the most recent are AREThOU5A, AgriSens, IRRISENS,\nAgro-IoT, SWAMP and\
    \ a proposed four-layered architecture by Kour in 2020, each referring\nto soil\
    \ agriculture.\nKamienski et al. propose SWAMP, a generalized architecture oriented\
    \ to the intelligent\nmanagement of irrigation for agricultural systems on the\
    \ ground incorporating different\ninterconnection strategies between its elements\
    \ to address the problems of communication\nin greenhouses on a large-scale using\
    \ fog nodes in the soil with LoRaWAN routers. Its\narchitecture is made up of\
    \ ﬁve layers, which include the sending of information to end users,\ndistribution\
    \ models for irrigation, use of drones for vision inspection, data analysis models\n\
    in the cloud fog nodes using as references the relative humidity of the soil,\
    \ databases,\nsecurity for data acquisition, sensors, actuators and weather reports,\
    \ among others [32].\nBased on the literature reviewed by Kour et al. from 2015\
    \ to 2020 and related to the\nadvances and development of agriculture, the authors\
    \ show, as a conceptual representation,\na reference to IoT architecture for agriculture\
    \ made up of six layers (Agro-IoT), including:\na perception layer for sensors,\
    \ actuators, wireless nodes, etc.; a network layer that en-\ncompasses the communication\
    \ protocols, software middle layer, application layer for data\nanalysis and prediction;\
    \ a user layer where results are directed to farmers, experts in the\narea, the\
    \ supply chain and industries. With the aim of monitoring low-scale greenhouses\n\
    in real time, optimizing resource use, the early detection of diseases, identiﬁcation\
    \ of crop\nspecies, optimization of irrigation facilities and effective use of\
    \ pesticides and fertilizers, the\nauthors propose an IoT architecture for solar\
    \ precision agriculture with four layers, includ-\ning: a sensory layer, a network\
    \ layer considering IoT nodes and base stations; a decision\nlayer involving server\
    \ services, workstations, work and knowledge base; an application\nlayer involving\
    \ how researchers, experts and farmers receive the information [33].\nFilev et\
    \ al. propose IRISENS, which is an architecture made up of ﬁve modules: the\n\
    devices and network, kernel, external services, data management, intelligent services\
    \ and\nuser interface. In their proposal, they incorporate two models of microservices,\
    \ one oriented\nSensors 2022, 22, 5646\n6 of 28\nto irrigation management based\
    \ on the evapotranspiration of the crop and another for\nthe collection of data\
    \ from sensors and weather prediction services. Additionally, they\nincorporate\
    \ data authentication between each module [34].\nBoursians et al. suggest AREThOU5A\
    \ a ﬁve-layer structure involving a physical layer,\ndata link, network, authentication\
    \ and application. Its main contribution is the integration\nof a weather forecast\
    \ service to deﬁne better cultivation strategies, as well as the ability to\n\
    use machine learning in data analysis and a solar charging system for RF communication\n\
    devices located in the ﬁeld [35].\nRoy et al. propose Agrisens, described as an\
    \ architecture of three layers: sensors and\nactuators, remote processing and\
    \ service, and an application layer. The irrigation schemes\nare separated according\
    \ to the life cycle of the crop in four stages considering the situations\nwhere\
    \ the crop remains with water in the soil, irrigation under dry soil conditions\
    \ and\nirrigation under wet soil conditions. Its structure offers the farmer the\
    \ establishment of\ncommunication with the system through GSM messaging [36].\n\
    2.2. Irrigation Systems\nIrrigation systems have been used in soil and soilless\
    \ crops. Some of the most relevant\nones are described below. In soil cultivation,\
    \ there are different approaches to estimate irri-\ngation needs in cultivation,\
    \ highlighting the monitoring and control of the environmental\ntemperature, soil\
    \ moisture, evapotranspiration and water stress index. Authors such as\nGonzález-Amarillo\
    \ [37] and Fernández-Ahumada [38] use humidity and/or temperature\nmeasurement\
    \ to turn on irrigation, ventilation and heating systems, while Mohamed [39] and\n\
    Poyen [40] estimate the irrigation needs by performing the daily evapotranspiration\
    \ measure-\nment as reference. While Mohamed uses the Penman–Monteith method,\
    \ Poyen includes as a\nfeature of his system the automatic choice between the\
    \ Hargreaves and Samni, Kharufa and\nPenman–Monteith methods according to climate\
    \ type and geographical considerations.\nJamroen et al. use a fuzzy controller\
    \ to adjust the irrigation considering the variables\nof humidity and water stress\
    \ index [22], while Lloret et al. perform irrigation by ﬂooding,\nallowing automatic\
    \ irrigation by measuring crop variables and climatic conditions, or\nremote activation\
    \ using a mobile app [41].\nIn soilless farming, Puengsungwan et al. propose a\
    \ method to determine root stress\nin relation to the difference in environmental\
    \ leaf temperature and light intensity in hy-\ndroponic crops considering environmental\
    \ temperature control between 28 and 32 ◦C. In\ntheir proposal, the patterns obtained\
    \ are separated by regions considering a normal root,\nwith stress and a rotting\
    \ root. Using IoT technologies, they reduce the response time of the\nsystem from\
    \ 5 min to less than 60 s and increase the efﬁciency in detection from 85% to\
    \ 95%\nin comparison with a method based on identifying the reduction in the leaf\
    \ area of the crop\nby means of the Easy Leaf Area app [23].\nIn aeroponic crops,\
    \ the main variables monitored to manage the irrigation systems\nare the temperature\
    \ and humidity inside the greenhouse. Lucero et al., monitored the\ntemperature\
    \ and humidity inside a greenhouse used for aeroponic cultivation, establishing\n\
    the times of irrigation for the day and night under three stages according to\
    \ the days of\nproduction. In their proposal, when the temperature exceeds 35\
    \ ◦C, the irrigation period\nis reduced. In their study, they compared a crop\
    \ of 21 lettuces showing that an aeroponic\nsystem outperforms the traditional\
    \ crop in soil in terms of the number of leaves, average\ndiameter of the leaves\
    \ and average length of the root by 57%, 42% and 40%, respectively [14].\nJamhari\
    \ et al. present the control of the relative temperature and humidity in the root\n\
    chamber, in which they turn on a Peltier cell that cools the nutrient solution\
    \ maintaining a\nrange from 25 to 29 ◦C in the chamber, while the relative humidity\
    \ is controlled between 50%\nand 70% through an ultrasonic humidiﬁer and a fan\
    \ [42]. Gour et al. propose the use of a\ncentral processor with an interface\
    \ between sensors, actuators and machine learning tools to\nautomate the cultivation\
    \ process [43]. On the other hand, some proposals consider the use of\nIoT architectures\
    \ for the monitoring and control of devices. Aiming to implement a vertical\n\
    cultivation chamber to care for crops from germination to harvest, Belista et\
    \ al. present\nSensors 2022, 22, 5646\n7 of 28\nthe design of a vertical cultivation\
    \ chamber distributed in master and slave modules. The\nmaster module controls\
    \ the nutrient containers, the water-cooling system, an evaporative\nfan and a\
    \ power supply, while the slave modules control the pumps that transport the\n\
    nutrients to the crop. The IoT architecture that is presented to manipulate the\
    \ weather\ncontrol systems, the aeroponic irrigation and the mixing chamber for\
    \ nutrients is based on\na central controller, which reads and writes commands\
    \ to acquire information from the\nsensors and thus manipulates the system actuators.\
    \ The information acquired is stored\nlocally, where the user can access the information\
    \ through an application for mobile devices\nthat is linked to the central controller\
    \ through a SAMBA server [44].\nAccording to the literature, there are a wide\
    \ variety of IoT architectures according\nto the functionality and elements that\
    \ each author deﬁnes between communication, the\ndatabase, devices integrated\
    \ into the network, security, services or microservices and their\nrelationship\
    \ with the end user. Similarly, among the various forms of cultivation, the\n\
    variables in common are temperature, humidity, transpiration and luminosity.\n\
    The previously mentioned proposals present connectivity schemes mainly oriented\n\
    to the acquisition of information from climate sensors for weather conditions,\
    \ control of\nactuators for the adjustment of weather conditions and irrigation\
    \ schemes, and user access\nto the systems to supervise the information collected\
    \ and to be able to modify the irrigation\nstrategies; nevertheless, they do not\
    \ contemplate the study of climatic variables for the\nanalysis of the VPD and\
    \ the appearance of water stress.\nTo approach the study of water stress in relation\
    \ to the frequency and time of irrigation,\nas well as the climatic variables\
    \ in the environment and cultivation in a practical way in\naeroponic systems,\
    \ the system proposed in this study integrates features such as crop\ntemperature\
    \ measurement, irrigation programming, automation through microservices,\nthe\
    \ use of a central processor and the integration of a SAMBA server as addressed\
    \ by\nPuengsungwan, Lucero, Loret, Gour and Belista, respectively. However, our\
    \ proposal has\nsensory elements, processing, administration, storage and remote\
    \ access through a 4-layer\nIoT architecture with the ﬂexibility of incorporating\
    \ more sensory elements, processing and\ndecision-making capabilities through\
    \ the fog layer, and system administration functions\nin the user layer for further\
    \ studies to modify the functional structure of the proposed\nIoT architecture.\
    \ The IoT architecture presented consists of an end devices layer, fog layer,\n\
    cloud layer and application layer. Among the main features incorporated in our\
    \ proposal\nare the following:\n1.\nThe grouping of electronic sensors and vision\
    \ systems with end devices.\n2.\nThe administration of end devices through independent\
    \ services for reading sensors,\nand the remote activation of actuators and acquisition\
    \ systems for standard WEB,\nUSB and thermographic cameras using a SAMBA server.\
    \ Additionally, it has an alert\nservice via SMTP in case of failure of the other\
    \ services. All of the above is through\nthe fog layer.\n3.\nA local and cloud\
    \ database. The local database is dedicated to the storage of RGB top,\nside and\
    \ root images, as well as thermographic images in the root. The database in the\n\
    cloud is used for the storage of time-series data generated by the electronic\
    \ sensors, in\naddition to the status of the sensors and actuators, the operating\
    \ status of the services\nof the system, as well as the storage of the last result\
    \ of the image processing.\n4.\nThe implementation of an Android application for\
    \ the manual registration of the vari-\nables related to the nutrient solution,\

    The proposed monitoring system is based on a four-layer IoT architecture: device\
    \ layer,\nfog layer, cloud layer and application layer (Figure 3). In Figures\
    \ 1 and 2, the end devices\nincorporated in the device layer of Figure 3 are labeled.\
    \ End device 1 (ED1) integrates the\nsensors used for the measurement of temperature\
    \ and luminosity in the greenhouse, as well\nas with the leaf temperature and\
    \ humidity sensors. End device 2 (ED2) integrates the level\nand temperature sensors\
    \ of the recirculating solution tank, as well as the pump activation\nsystem for\
    \ the stages of irrigation, recirculation and mixing between the recovered nutrient\n\
    solution and that stored in the main tank. End device 3 (ED3) integrates sensors\
    \ for level\nand temperature measurement from the main solution tank. End device\
    \ 4 (ED4) integrates\nthe cameras used for the registration of the growth of the\
    \ crop. Finally, end device 5 (ED5)\nis made up of a thermographic camera and\
    \ a mobile device to send the information to the\nfog layer. The device layer\
    \ consists of ﬁve end devices, ED1, ED2 and ED3 are made up of\nNodeMCU development\
    \ boards based on Web Server, ED4 has a standard USB camera and\nan IP camera,\
    \ both managed by the fog layer through a Raspberry development board, as\nlong\
    \ as the device has a standard USB thermal imager connected to a mobile device\
    \ based\non SMB. The information acquired by each end device is transmitted to\
    \ the fog layer.\n \ngreenhouse, as well as with the leaf temperature and humidity\
    \ sensors. End device 2 \n(ED2) integrates the level and temperature sensors of\
    \ the recirculating solution tank, as \nwell as the pump activation system for\
    \ the stages of irrigation, recirculation and mixing \nbetween the recovered nutrient\
    \ solution and that stored in the main tank. End device 3 \n(ED3) integrates sensors\
    \ for level and temperature measurement from the main solution \ntank. End device\
    \ 4 (ED4) integrates the cameras used for the registration of the growth of \n\
    the crop. Finally, end device 5 (ED5) is made up of a thermographic camera and\
    \ a mobile \ndevice to send the information to the fog layer. The device layer\
    \ consists of five end \ndevices, ED1, ED2 and ED3 are made up of NodeMCU development\
    \ boards based on Web \nServer, ED4 has a standard USB camera and an IP camera,\
    \ both managed by the fog layer \nthrough a Raspberry development board, as long\
    \ as the device has a standard USB \nthermal imager connected to a mobile device\
    \ based on SMB. The information acquired by \neach end device is transmitted to\
    \ the fog layer. \nThe fog layer is made up of a set of microservices in charge\
    \ of managing the \ninformation locally or remotely through one of several servers\
    \ in the cloud. Locally, 4 \nservices are executed independently: irrigation service\
    \ in charge of turning the sprinkler \nsystem on and off according to the irrigation\
    \ frequency and the day and night switch-on \ntime programmed by the user; reservoir\
    \ service responsible for monitoring the level of \nthe secondary tank and generating\
    \ the recirculation of the nutrient solution to the main \ntank; the camera service\
    \ in charge of taking screenshots of the plant from the side and top \nview according\
    \ to the schedule programmed by the user, generating a local database; \nlikewise,\
    \ it is in charge of processing the images coming from all the cameras installed\
    \ in \nthe system; CV-GUI Services, the remote user interface used to manage system\
    \ settings \nand status. \n \nFigure 3. IoT architecture of the monitoring system.\
    \ \nOn the other hand, the sensor service, control service and alert service microservices\
    \ \nmanage the exchange of information between the sensors, local microservices\
    \ and the \nFigure 3. IoT architecture of the monitoring system.\nThe fog layer\
    \ is made up of a set of microservices in charge of managing the informa-\ntion\

    schedule programmed by the user, generating a local database; likewise, it is\
    \ in charge\nof processing the images coming from all the cameras installed in\
    \ the system; CV-GUI\nServices, the remote user interface used to manage system\
    \ settings and status.\nOn the other hand, the sensor service, control service\
    \ and alert service microservices\nmanage the exchange of information between\
    \ the sensors, local microservices and the\nThingspeak server. The sensor service\
    \ is responsible for collecting information from each\none of the sensors of the\
    \ environmental variables, the nutrient solution, as well as the state\nof execution\
    \ of the irrigation systems, the recirculation of the nutrient solution and the\n\
    activating of the cameras installed to upload the data to the cloud. The control\
    \ service\nSensors 2022, 22, 5646\n11 of 28\nhas the function of scanning the\
    \ server’s control data channel before the start of new\nconﬁgurations for the\
    \ irrigation system and the camera system, as well as the remote\nactivation of\
    \ the sprinkler nozzles, the recirculating stage and the nutrient solution mixer.\n\
    The alert services are in charge of monitoring the operation of all the services;\
    \ in case one of\nthem is interrupted by a failure, it sends an alert via SMTP.\
    \ In addition to the microservices,\nthe fog layer integrates an SMB server, which\
    \ allows connectivity between the standard\nthermographic camera and the image\
    \ database through its USB connection to an Android,\nWindows or Linux device,\
    \ and this in turn as an SMB user.\nThe cloud layer is made up of the data storage\
    \ and analytics services built into the\nThingspeak and Firebase platforms. Thingspeak\
    \ is used as a database with a time-series\nformat, as well as for data analysis\
    \ and visualization of results through its IoT analytics\ntools. For this investigation,\
    \ four Thingspeak channels are used for: the administration of\nthe variables\
    \ of the environmental temperature, the temperature in the leaf, the relative\n\
    humidity in the environment and the leaf, the level and the temperature of the\
    \ recirculation\ndeposit, as well as light intensity (environmental measurements\
    \ channel); administration of\nthe variables related to the level and temperature\
    \ of the main nutrient solution tank and the\noperating status of the chambers,\
    \ the irrigation system and the recirculating stage (services\nchannel); storage\
    \ of variables ambient temperature, relative humidity, crop temperature,\npH,\
    \ EC, fresh weight, length and width of the lettuce leaf, all of them implemented\
    \ manually\nusing standard instruments and recorded through the app generated\
    \ in this study (manual\nmeasurements channel); management of requests from the\
    \ end user to download or update\nadministration of requests for the irrigation\
    \ times and camera triggers, as well as remotely\nactivating the irrigation system,\
    \ the recirculating stage as well as the nutrient solution\nmixer (control channel).\
    \ Firebase, on the other hand, has a real-time database stored in\nJSON format,\
    \ as well as a database for ﬁle storage. The use of Firebase is intended for the\n\
    conﬁguration of the parameters for the processing of the images, as well as the\
    \ storage\nof the images processed by the fog layer, allowing the platform to\
    \ request speciﬁc image\nprocessing services between the application developed\
    \ in this research and the fog layer.\nFinally, the application layer is an Android\
    \ app called “Aeroponics Monitor”, which,\nthrough HTTP requests, makes requests\
    \ to the Thingspeak server for the generation of\ncomparative or analytical reports\
    \ between variables, performance reports of installed\nsensors and communication\
    \ with the platform, historical data by variable, access to the\nconﬁguration\
    \ of the irrigation systems and the triggering of the image capture devices as\n\
    well as the manual control of actuators through remote access, the measurement\
    \ of the\ncultivation parameters and the registration of the amount of nitric\
    \ acid and solution A and\nB dissolved in the nutrient solution to readjust the\
    \ pH and EC ranges. Likewise, it has\naccess through Firebase to the latest results\
    \ of the processing of the images generated by\nthe fog layer.\n3.3. Aeroponics\
    \ Monitor App\nThe Aeroponics Monitor is an application developed at Android Studio\
    \ and registered\nin INDAUTOR Mexico under the registration number 03-201-10514230-01;\

    \ variables of the aeroponic system individ-\nually, showing an analysis of the\
    \ data stored for one hour, 12 h, one day and up to three\ndays by making an HTTP\
    \ request to the server. Among the variables monitored in this\nsection are the\
    \ temperature of the nutrient solution, the environmental temperature, the\ncrop\
    \ temperature, the relative humidity of the environment, the relative humidity\
    \ of the\ncrop, luminosity, temperature of the recirculation tank and level of\
    \ the recirculation tank\n(Figure 4c).\n3.3.3. Settings Window\nThe settings window\
    \ gives users access to modify the parameters for activation of the\nimage acquisition\
    \ system, as well as the frequency and time of ignition (day/night) of the\nirrigation\
    \ system (Figure 4d).\n3.3.4. Manual Controls Window\nThe window for manual controls\
    \ allows a link to be established remotely with the\nirrigation system. Its operation\
    \ is based on downloading the latest state of each actuator to\nshow it on the\
    \ app’s switches, as well as updating each state when the “SEND” button is\npressed,\
    \ so that the control service executes the orders in the greenhouse (Figure 4e).\n\
    3.3.5. Manual Measurements Window\nThrough this window, the user makes a manual\
    \ record of the evolution of crop\nparameters, such as fresh weight, length, width\
    \ and temperature of the lettuce leaf; the\nevolution of the environmental variables\
    \ considering the temperature and the relative\nhumidity in the environment; the\
    \ evolution of the parameters in the nutritive solution\nSensors 2022, 22, 5646\n\
    14 of 28\nconsidering the pH and EC. All these parameters are stored in the server\
    \ for the generation\nof the record and reports (Figure 4f).\n3.3.6. Manual Readjust\
    \ Window\nThe manual readjust window allows the user to check the temperature\
    \ and level of\neach tank in the aeroponic system, as well as a quick reading\
    \ of the latest pH and EC value\n(Figure 4g). To readjust the pH and EC value,\
    \ the total evacuation of the recirculation tank\nmust be considered through the\
    \ manual control window to later read the number of liters\nin the main tank and\
    \ record the amount of nitric acid used to lower the pH, as well as\nthe amount\
    \ of solution A and B to compensate for the quantity of salts dissolved in the\n\
    nutrient solution.\n3.3.7. Image Analysis Window\nThe image analysis window allows\
    \ viewing the latest data capture taken by the image\nacquisition systems of the\
    \ monitoring system. Among the results that allow visualization\nof the platform\
    \ are the lateral image, the upper image, the processing of the leaf area index\n\
    (LAI), as well as the latest RGB images and IR of leaf and root obtained by the\
    \ thermal\ncamera (Figure 4h).\n3.4. Data Management\nAmong the main challenges\
    \ faced in IoT applications are data ofﬂoading, heterogeneity\nand big data [45].\
    \ To reduce the latency between the IoT sensors described in the proposal\nand\
    \ the Thingspeak server, sensor service makes consecutive requests via HTTP protocol\
    \ to\neach of the end devices, collecting and grouping the information, from climate\
    \ and nutrient\nsolution sensors, in a single package and registering it on the\
    \ server. Between each request\nfrom sensor service to server, 30 s waiting interval\
    \ is taken.\nTo address the heterogeneity of the data, sensor service operates\
    \ sequentially, while the\nservices oriented towards image capture and irrigation\
    \ and recirculation services operate\nin parallel through the camera service,\
    \ irrigation service and reservoir service, respectively.\nEach service in operation\
    \ generates a binary log ﬁle (npy ﬁle), storing the latest state of\nsensors and\
    \ actuators, through which it shares the information with other services running\n\
    on the fog layer.\nRegarding the amount of data that can be generated between\
    \ numerical records and\nimages through IoT devices, numerical records are stored\
    \ in Thingspeak with a maximum\nof 2880 requests per day out of 8200 possible,\
    \ while the image records from the side and\nupper view of the plant are directly\
    \ stored in the SD memory on the fog layer. The number\nof images generated depends\
    \ on times scheduled for image acquisition (9/day/camera in\nthis experiment).\n\
    3.5. Remote Operation\nRemote operation of the aeroponic system is achieved from\
    \ reading (continuous) and\nwriting (on demand) of the control’s data channel\
    \ (command vector), which hosts the latest\nstatus of the system’s irrigation,\
    \ recirculation and mixer actuators, as well as the command\nstates that trigger\
    \ the image capture system, writing or reading of conﬁgurations referring\nto\
    \ the interval and frequency of irrigation (Figure 5). Each of these states is\
    \ encoded and\ndecoded in the communication process between fog layer and the\
    \ app.\nSensors 2022, 22, 5646\n15 of 28\n \ng (\n)\n(\n)\nlatest status of the\
    \ system’s irrigation, recirculation and mixer actuators, as well as \ncommand\
    \ states that trigger the image capture system, writing or reading \nconfigurations\
    \ referring to the interval and frequency of irrigation (Figure 5). Each of th\n\
    states is encoded and decoded in the communication process between fog layer and\
    \ \napp. \n \nFigure 5. Command vector for remote operation from App. \nFigure\
    \ 5. Command vector for remote operation from App.\nCommand vector is a message\
    \ encoded in 10 bits, a bit for the activation or deactivation\n(1 or 0) of any\
    \ actuator or service hosted in the fog layer, followed by a status bit to detect\
    \ if\nthe request has been attended or not (1 or 0) by the fog layer, ending with\
    \ a parity bit to avoid\nerrors in the communication between the app and fog layer.\
    \ Response messages between\nthe communication are stored in numerical form in\
    \ Thingspeak control’s data channel.\n3.6. Cost of Using the Platform\nTo establish\
    \ the minimum operating conditions of the proposed architecture, free\nlicenses\
    \ for Thingspeak and Firebase servers are used. Thingspeak under a free license\n\
    allows a message limit of approximately 3 million/year or 8200 messages/day with\
    \ an\nupdate rate of 15 s. Likewise, it allows us to use 4 channels with 8 ﬁelds\
    \ for numerical data.\nCurrently, the development of this work requires 27 of\
    \ the 32 available ﬁelds. In case of\nrequiring more ﬁelds than assigned, a student,\
    \ home, standard or academic license can be\nobtained, specifying the number of\
    \ channels and update rate (1 s as minimum) with a cost\nfrom USD 79.00 for 33\
    \ million/year/units [46]. Among the services offered by Firebase\nsubscription\
    \ are real-time database and cloud storage, which are used in this project in\n\
    its free mode (Spark) to store the most recent results of image processing according\
    \ to\nthe schedule assigned by camera service or downloading them by request from\
    \ the app.\nFirebase in these services allows storage of 1 GB and 5 GB, respectively.\
    \ In the case of the\nreal-time database, it allows downloads of up to 10 GB/month\
    \ and in the case of cloud\nstorage a bandwidth of 1 GB/day. For higher storage,\
    \ bandwidth or additional features,\nFirebase offers a pay as you go (Blaze) plan\
    \ and a cost calculator in its website [47].\n3.7. Improvements Using a Fog Layer\n\
    In cloud-based IoT environments, latency is often high due to the distance between\n\
    IoT devices and the cloud, this increases cloud response time. As the number of\
    \ IoT devices\nincreases, the cloud cannot support the real-time demands of these\
    \ [48]. According to\nThingspeak, for each write request attended, a message is\
    \ consumed [49]. By using a\nfog layer in our proposal, it allows grouping the\
    \ information in packets of 8 numerical\ndata, uploading them to the server using\
    \ only a single request per channel. This involves\nhandling writing to the server\
    \ of up to 32 numeric variables with a single wait interval. On\nthe other hand,\
    \ Firebase has the Firebase ML service, which has models with the ability to\n\
    recognize text, image labeling, object detection and tracking, among others; however,\
    \ it is\nlimited to the use of TensorFlow Lite models [50]. Using a fog layer\
    \ as a central processing\nelement allows the execution of multiple vision algorithms\
    \ without dependence on external\nservice or additional usage cost. In consideration\
    \ of the use of Firebase only as storage for\nimage processing results, the bandwidth\
    \ used to download data from the server to the app\nimplies only 150.05 kB/request/user.\n\

    \ of the monitoring system, a Batavia lettuce seedling\nwas subjected to observation\

    \ main tank with 50 L of prepared nutritive solution with 5 mL/l of solution A\n\
    and 5 mL solution B, with pH initial 6.0 y EC 915 ppm. From the transplant, the\
    \ platform\nwas set up to irrigate the seedling every 24 min day/night with an\

    \ when the ambient\ntemperature exceeds 35 ◦C [14], as well as the control of\
    \ the temperature and humidity in\nthe root chamber between 25 and 29 ◦C [40];\
    \ however, they do not consider the standard\nmarkers of crop water needs such\
    \ as the crop temperature, VPD or water stress index.\nIn the present paper, a\
    \ Batavia lettuce seedling was subjected to observation in the\naeroponic cultivation\
    \ chamber from its transplant, preserving the ranges of pH and EC\nbetween 5.5\
    \ and 6.5 and 750 and 1100 ppm and with a constant irrigation system every\n24\
    \ min day/night with an activation time of 30 s. According to the experimental\
    \ results,\nthe DTla does not provide a speciﬁc criterion for the determination\
    \ of water stress in\nan aeroponic crop; more studies are required on the Batavia\
    \ lettuce variety to estimate\nthe temperature ranges where the DTla serve as\
    \ a concrete marker of water stress. The\nexperimentation in the crop camera that\
    \ was presented shows how the VPD from the\nbeginning marked a potential root\
    \ damage due to water stress. Figure 9 illustrates how a\ntemperature between\
    \ 10 and 20 ◦C together with a relative humidity above 35% favors the\nreduction\
    \ in the VPD. Figure 16 shows, in relation to the fresh weight, an increase in\
    \ VPD\nreduction. Figure 16 shows, in relation to the fresh weight, a consistent\
    \ increase; however,\nthe leaf size presented a reduction in the rate of growth\
    \ from the ﬁrst week.\nThe estimation of the VPD in conjunction with image processing\
    \ provides an estimate\nof the appearance and evolution of water stress in aeroponic\
    \ crops. Among the main actions\nto evaluate against a high VPD and the reduction\
    \ in the rate of growth of the leaf, is the\nincrease in the frequency of irrigation,\
    \ as well as the incorporation of a system that allows\nthe control of external\
    \ environmental parameters.\nIn the literature studied, both conceptual and practices\
    \ in the development of crops in\nthe soil, hydroponics and aeroponics, address\
    \ the grouping schemes of components that\nmake up the stages and connectivity\
    \ of an IoT architecture.\nAccording to the practical proposals found in the literature,\
    \ by using IoT-based tech-\nnologies to manage irrigation conditions and proposals\
    \ related to aeroponics, in comparison\nwith our proposal, the following were\
    \ found: similarities between layers using IoT architec-\nture and functionalities\
    \ using functional blocks addressed by Boursianis, Roy and Lloret;\ncommon study\
    \ variables addressed by Lucero, Jamhari and Belista. According to this\ncriterion,\
    \ the differences are highlighted in Table 5.\nAs shown, most of the systems consider\
    \ the measurement of environmental variables\nand, depending on the meteorological\
    \ data of the case to determine the irrigation and\nmonitoring needs, the automated\
    \ monitoring of the nutritional conditions of the nutritive\nsolution. However,\
    \ the previous studies do not consider the monitoring of crop growth\nfrom image\
    \ acquisition and analysis systems, nor do they include reports and alerts due\
    \ to\nthe failure of the electronic systems used in the proposal. In the proposal\
    \ that is presented\nin this paper, there is an application that not only accesses\

    \ functionality status of the incorporated electronic\nsystems, allowing the user\
    \ to be alert to the maintenance needs of electronic elements and\nsoftware incorporated\
    \ in the IoT architecture that has been presented. This proposal does\nnot yet\
    \ incorporate the temperature control and humidity in the greenhouse; however,\n\
    the architecture developed presents the ﬂexibility to incorporate additional monitoring\n\

    \ and Further Studies\nThis article presents an IoT architecture that facilitates\
    \ the management of an aeroponic\ngreenhouse through the registration of manual\
    \ procedures, the automation of the irrigation\nsystem and the monitoring of environmental\
    \ variables in cultivation; all this with the\nsupport of a visualization tool\
    \ from an app.\nThe estimation of the VPD indicates the appearance of water stress\
    \ due to the insufﬁ-\ncient absorption of crop water. This suggests the importance\
    \ of making an adaptation to\nthe atomization times and the intervals of the times\
    \ of irrigation, as well as the cooling and\nventilation systems.\nThe main contribution\
    \ of this paper is the integration of smart sensors, in a techno-\nlogical solution\
    \ based on IoT, that allows the study of the favorable conditions for the\ngrowth\
    \ of aeroponic crops with remote management. The app developed for this purpose\n\
    allows the visualization of historical variables of temperature and relative humidity\
    \ in\nthe environment and crops, VPD and luminosity, as well as the level and\
    \ temperature\nof the nutrient solution tanks to carry out the adjustment of pH\
    \ and EC. The proposed\narchitecture allows the incorporation of monitoring and\
    \ image processing systems that\nwill enrich the studies of the thermography and\
    \ morphology of the aeroponic crops for\nroots and leaves. Additionally, the proposed\
    \ architecture manages the heterogeneity of\ndata through microservices and allows\
    \ us to reduce latency in the communication with the\nserver using, as a basis,\

  limitations: '**Limitations**


    The paper does not discuss the limitations of the proposed system in detail. However,
    one potential limitation is that the system relies on a centralized controller,
    which could be a single point of failure. Additionally, the system is designed
    for use in a commercial greenhouse, and it is not clear how well it would perform
    in other environments, such as a home greenhouse or a field.


    The proposed system is still under development, and it is not yet clear how well
    it will perform in a commercial setting. Additionally, the system is designed
    for use in a greenhouse, and it is not clear how well it would perform in other
    environments, such as a field.


    Another potential limitation is that the system requires a lot of data to operate,
    and it is not clear how well it will perform if the data is not available or is
    inaccurate.


    Finally, the system is not designed to be used with other precision agriculture
    technologies, such as sensors and actuators. This could limit the system''s ability
    to optimize irrigation and improve crop yield.'

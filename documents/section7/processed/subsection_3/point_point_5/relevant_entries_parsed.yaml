  data_sources: Qualitative methods of data collection and analysis
  explanation: 'As part of a larger endeavor, we aim to design a “second generation”
    information system in the form of a hydro-climatic information system called a
    hydro-climatic Environmental Virtual Observatory. Karpouzoglou et al., (2016)
    indicate that in the context of emerging open-technologies for information exchange,
    added value can be achieved by removing institutional and geographical barriers
    associated with information flow. In this paper we aim to diagnose the socio-ecological
    settings of rice farming systems in northern Ghana in the context of climate variability
    and change to ensure effective design and operationalisation of hydro-climatic
    EVO.


    Secondly, seasonal climate information such as onset and cessation date, above,
    below and normal rainfall generated from the analysis of the ECMWF-S4 temperature
    and rainfall data will be used to complement those predicted by farmers using
    their indigenous knowledge. In a similar way daily weather information (be it
    yes/no rain, low, medium or high rainfall) received by farmers will complement
    information estimated from the daily data from ECMWF-S4 or any other weather model.
    There is potentially great value in combining both sources of data.'
  extract_1: '"Indigenous forecasts are based on farmers’ experience of changes in
    certain biophysical indicators ( Orlove et al., 2010; Roncoli et al.,2002). Literature
    shows that African farmers are using various local weather indicators such as
    plants, animals, insects, the solar system and wind in predicting the weather
    and climate ( Speranza et al., 2010; Ziervogel and Opere, 2010; Tarhule and Lamb,
    2003; Roncoli et al.,2002). Studies have therefore suggested that particularly
    in Africa indigenous knowledge has the potential to enhance farmers’ adaptation
    to climate variability and change ( Naess, 2013; Derbile et al., 2016; Mikkelsen
    and Langohr, 2004)."'
  extract_2: '"Our diagnostics resulted in different hydro-climatic information needs,
    challenges and opportunities for an EVO. We propose a hydro-climatic EVO ( Fig.
    4) consisting of three major elements; (i) data sources, (ii) data handling processes,
    (iii) platform for information and data exchange. The first element of the framework
    is the data sources. Data will be sourced from two main knowledge systems; indigenous
    and scientific knowledge systems (see Fig. 4). First, as explained earlier, Ghanaian
    farmers use indigenous ecological knowledge to understand weather and climate
    patterns in order to make decisions about crop and irrigation cycles (Frimpong,
    2013). Prior to every season the EVO will collect farmers’ seasonal climate and
    daily weather forecast information. These indigenous forecast information from
    farmers will be complemented with those from scientific forecast.'

  explanation: '**Explanation**


    The research article titled "Simulating socio-hydrological responses to climatic
    conditions in Phoenix, Arizona" by Renee Obringer and Dave D. White presents an
    agent-based model (ABM) that simulates how water supply is affected by local climate
    conditions and water consumption patterns in the city of Phoenix. The model considers
    various climate variables (precipitation, temperature, evaporation, streamflow)
    and household water consumption, which is influenced by water conservation attitudes
    and behaviors. Using data from a household survey conducted in Phoenix, the ABM
    categorizes households into seven archetypes based on their water conservation
    attitudes and quantifies their water consumption accordingly. The model calculates
    the change in water storage over time based on the water balance equation, accounting
    for water inputs and outputs from the system. The authors evaluate the model performance
    by comparing the simulated water supply with historical observations and report
    high accuracy with low error rates, indicating that the model is a reliable representation
    of the water system in Phoenix.


    **Relevance Evaluation**


    **This article is highly relevant to the point raised in the review outline, which
    focuses on providing user-friendly interfaces for farmers to input preferences,
    constraints, and expert knowledge into automated irrigation systems using techniques
    like participatory design or user-centered design.** The ABM developed in this
    study addresses the broader context and intent of the literature review by demonstrating
    how household water consumption patterns can be influenced by water conservation
    attitudes and how these attitudes can impact the overall water supply system.
    Although the model does not directly simulate farmer behavior or the use of automated
    irrigation systems, it provides a framework for understanding how user preferences
    and behaviors can affect water resource management, which is essential for the
    development and implementation of user-friendly interfaces for automated irrigation
    systems. The insights gained from this study can inform the design of interfaces
    that effectively engage farmers and facilitate their participation in water management
    decisions.

    **Limitations**


    The study relies on survey data to categorize households into archetypes, which
    may not fully capture the complexity and diversity of water conservation attitudes
    and behaviors in the population.

    The model assumes that households within each archetype have uniform water consumption
    patterns, which may not be the case in reality.

    The model does not account for changes in climate conditions or water conservation
    attitudes over time.

- explanation: '**Issue:** Once they are dissolved in water, metal salts acquire the
    ability to dissociate ions, which can cause an electrical current to flow through
    a solution. The current density from this movement of ions is proportional to
    the quantity of ions present in the solution. This property is utilized in electrochemical
    sensors, which are used to quantify the presence of specific ions, including hydrogen
    atoms (which have a +1 charge, making them "+1" ions), in a solution. There are
    instruments like pH sensors and ammonia gas sensors that are extremely sensitive
    and can be employed for monitoring health and food quality.


    **Problem:** The production of electrochemical sensors often includes harmful
    chemicals and synthetic materials, which upon improper disposal, can pose health
    hazards resulting from heavy metal (such as RuCl3) contamination in the environment.
    Unmanaged disposal of electrodes after sensor use can also lead to heavy metal
    contamination in landfills, which may cause hazardous health effects if it reaches
    the water supply. This issue mandates sustainable disposal processes to ensure
    that discarded sensors and their components do not harm the environment or its
    inhabitants.


    **Solution:** This problem can be addressed through the adoption of sustainable
    and eco-friendly practices throughout the life cycle of electrochemical sensors,
    including their design, fabrication, and disposal. Here are some specific measures
    that can be implemented:


    **In the design phase:**

    * **Selection of environmentally friendly materials:** Choosing materials with
    less hazardous properties for the fabrication of sensors can significantly reduce
    the environmental impact. For instance, replacing heavy metals with non-toxic
    conductive materials can minimize the risks associated with heavy metal contamination.

    * **Design for longevity:** Designing sensors with a longer lifespan can reduce
    the overall number of sensors produced and discarded, thereby minimizing the environmental
    impact. Employing robust materials and fabrication techniques that enhance sensor
    durability can contribute to sustainability.

    * **Modular design:** Adopting a modular design approach allows for the replacement
    of individual components instead of discarding the entire sensor. This approach
    reduces waste and facilitates the repair and refurbishment of sensors, extending
    their useful life.


    **In the fabrication phase:**

    * **Sustainable manufacturing processes:** Utilizing eco-friendly manufacturing
    techniques, such as those that minimize energy consumption and reduce waste generation,
    can contribute to sustainable sensor production. Employing processes like screen-printing
    or inkjet printing, which require less energy and produce less waste compared
    to traditional methods like photolithography, can be beneficial.

    * **Use of recycled materials:** Incorporating recycled materials into the fabrication
    process can reduce the environmental impact associated with raw material extraction
    and processing. Using recycled plastics or metals in sensor components can promote
    circularity and minimize waste.

    * **Minimizing the use of hazardous chemicals:** Employing non-toxic and biodegradable
    materials in the fabrication process can reduce the potential for environmental
    contamination. Substituting hazardous chemicals with safer alternatives can minimize
    the risks associated with their disposal.


    **In the disposal phase:**

    * **Proper waste management:** Establishing proper waste management practices
    is crucial to ensure that discarded sensors and their components are handled responsibly.
    Implementing recycling programs for sensor components, such as electrodes and
    electronic parts, can recover valuable materials and reduce the amount of waste
    going to landfills.

    * **Collaboration with waste management companies:** Partnering with specialized
    waste management companies that have expertise in handling electronic waste can
    ensure the safe and environmentally sound disposal of electrochemical sensors.
    These companies employ appropriate technologies and processes to extract reusable
    materials and treat hazardous substances, minimizing the environmental impact
    of sensor disposal.


    To further enhance the sustainability of electrochemical sensors, researchers
    and manufacturers should actively explore innovative approaches, such as the development
    of biodegradable sensors or the integration of sensors into recyclable or compostable
    materials. By embracing these sustainable practices throughout the entire life
    cycle of electrochemical sensors, we can minimize their environmental impact and
    contribute to a more sustainable future.'

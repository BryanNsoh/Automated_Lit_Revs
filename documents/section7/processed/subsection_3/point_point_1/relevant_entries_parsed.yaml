    water use efficiency, optimize crop yields, and reduce labor costs. The integration
    of sensors and data analytics enables real-time monitoring of crop and soil conditions,
    allowing for precise adjustments to irrigation schedules. However, there are challenges
    related to the implementation and maintenance of closed-loop control systems,
    particularly in large-scale agricultural operations.
  limitations: While the paper provides a comprehensive overview of closed-loop control
    in irrigation, it does not delve deeply into the specific technical requirements
    and challenges associated with implementing such systems in large-scale agricultural
    operations.
  main_objective: This study reviews the current state-of-the-art in real-time irrigation
    management systems, highlighting the potential benefits and challenges of closed-loop
    control for optimizing water use and crop yields.
  relevance_evaluation: This paper aligns directly with the objective of exploring
    closed-loop control in autonomous irrigation systems within the context of ensuring
    system reliability. It provides a comprehensive overview of the concept, its benefits,
    and its practical implementation within the context of real-time irrigation management.
    The insights and examples provided in the paper directly support the analysis
    and discussion of closed-loop control in the literature review, making it highly
    relevant to the specific point.

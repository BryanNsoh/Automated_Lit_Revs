    Abstract: Wireless technologies are increasingly used in industrial applications.
    These technologies

    reduce cabling, which is costly and troublesome, and introduce several beneﬁts
    for their application in

    terms of ﬂexibility to modify the layout of the nodes and scaling of the number
    of connected devices.

    They may also introduce new functionalities since they ease the connections to
    mobile devices or

    parts. Although they have some drawbacks, they are increasingly accepted in industrial
    applications,

    especially for monitoring and supervision tasks. Recently, they are starting to
    be accepted even for

    time-critical tasks, for example, in closed-loop control systems involving slow
    dynamic processes.

    However, wireless technologies have been evolving very quickly during the last
    few years, since

    several relevant technologies are available in the market. For this reason, it
    may become difﬁcult to

    select the best alternative. This perspective article intends to guide application
    designers to choose the

    most appropriate technology in each case. For this purpose, this article discusses
    the most relevant

    wireless technologies in the industry and shows different examples of applications.

    Keywords: industrial Internet of Things (IIoT); wireless control systems; wireless
    sensor networks

    (WSNs); Industry 4.0; cyber–physical systems (CPS)

    1. Introduction

    The fourth industrial revolution, commonly known as Industry 4.0, introduces new

    concepts that enforce connectivity, such as cyber–physical systems (CPS), the
    Internet

    of Things (IoT), and wireless sensor networks (WSNs) [1]. These concepts are aimed
    to

    improve productivity and efﬁciency in manufacturing processes by connecting sensors,

    actuators, and controllers, boosting the economy as a result [2,3]. Communication
    tech-

    nologies are becoming key enablers in smart manufacturing processes since they
    ease

    integration between cyber–physical production systems (CPPS), which are at the
    core of

    Industry 4.0. In this scenario, communication technologies are evolving quite
    rapidly to be

    able to satisfy the quality-of-service (QoS) needs of modern applications. These
    technolo-

    gies are typically used in industrial applications for diverse tasks that involve
    monitoring,

    predictive maintenance, supervision, and control operations.

    Currently, wired solutions prevail in industrial domains. This is mainly because

    several standards have reached a high degree of maturity. Some of them are based
    on

    industrial Ethernet standards, such as Proﬁnet, Ethernet/IP, or EtherCAT. In fact,
    it is still

    common to ﬁnd even older digital buses in use, such as Proﬁbus, CANbus, or Modbus.

    These mature technologies are frequently considered safe and reliable, which are
    key issues

    in some conservative industrial domains [4]. Wired technologies will clearly remain
    in use

    in the future, especially in critical operations, such as closed-loop control
    over fast dynamic

    processes. However, wired solutions have several drawbacks: Cabling is expensive
    and

    difﬁcult to deploy, it produces not very ﬂexible layouts, and it is complex to
    use with

    Energies 2023, 16, 1349. https://doi.org/10.3390/en16031349

    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/energies

    Energies 2023, 16, 1349

    mobile devices or parts. Unfortunately, these drawbacks introduce some limitations
    in

    applications using wired solutions.

    In this scenario, wireless technologies enhance the interconnection capabilities
    at smart

    factories, thus allowing fully intelligent manufacturing systems [5,6]. Their
    use may achieve

    several beneﬁts: (1) introducing higher ﬂexibility to modify the layout of the
    links, which

    eases the deployment of the nodes and improves scalability; (2) enhancing the
    connectivity

    between decision-taking nodes and mobile devices or parts; and (3) eliminating
    wires,

    which reduces the deployment cost. Wireless technologies are becoming key enablers
    in

    different domains of the industry and, consequently, becoming increasingly relevant
    in

    academia. In fact, during the last few years, their use has remarkably grown in
    industrial

    environments. This trend is expected to follow during the next several years.
    A case in

    point is the estimated number of connected devices worldwide in 2021, which was
    around

    11.3 billion. This number is expected to reach 29.4 billion devices by 2030 [7].

    However, wireless technologies have also some drawbacks that reduce their pre-

    dictability and augment their error rate. The nature of wave propagation may cause
    diverse

    phenomena that reduce the quality of service (QoS) of wireless applications. The
    most rele-

    vant of these are fading, multipath propagation, shadowing, and interferences
    [8]. These

    phenomena have an impact on the reliability, integrity, and security of communication

    links when compared with wired communications. As a result, the bit-error rate
    increases,

    which may cause uncertainty in the applications.

    The introduction of wireless technologies in industrial facilities must face additional

    challenges. On the one hand, many industrial applications require deterministic
    communi-

    cation links in order to be accepted. Certain QoS parameters, such as the latency,
    jitter, and

    error rate, must be bounded. On the other hand, they must operate in environments
    full of

    metallic surfaces that may hinder wave propagation. This fact may cause difﬁculties
    given

    the strict requirements in critical applications.

    Currently, wireless technologies are frequently accepted in the industry for non-critical

    applications, i.e., those that involve monitoring, alerting, or data-logging tasks.
    In these

    cases, application failures do not have severe safety implications or do not produce
    large

    economic losses. However, the use of these technologies in critical applications
    is still

    under scrutiny. In fact, this is an interesting research topic that involves the
    mitigation of

    the inﬂuence of interferences, some of them caused by different technologies,
    handling the

    frequency spectrum adequately, and resolving collisions.

    To date, no wireless technology has been developed to be valid for all applications.
    On

    the contrary, different protocols were created over the years aiming to address
    speciﬁc sce-

    narios. Currently, several WSN standards are available. Some of them are general-purpose

    standards that are being applied in industrial applications. Others have been
    speciﬁ-

    cally designed for industrial applications by adapting standards such as IEEE
    802.15.1 [9]

    and, predominantly, IEEE 802.15.4 [10]. In fact, these standards have become the
    basis

    of many wireless technologies used at industrial factories for process automation.
    Thus,

    IEEE 802.15.4 is the foundational stone for some standards such as ZigBee, WirelessHART,

    ISA100.11a, or WIA-PA, whereas IEEE 802.15.1 is the base technology of WISA and
    WSAN-

    FA. All these technologies can coexist in the spectrum space but cannot be easily
    intercon-

    nected, so the problem of heterogeneity still persists. Moreover, most of these
    technologies,

    e.g., conventional WiFi, operate at the industrial, scientiﬁc, and medical (ISM)
    radio bands,

    in particular at the 2.4 GHz band, which may become saturated. Thus, interferences
    among

    different technologies are difﬁcult to avoid.

    This perspective article aims to present an overview of the most relevant technologies

    currently found in industrial WSN systems. It recaps the major characteristic
    of each

    technology, discusses their application domains, and shows some implementation
    examples.

    Thus, the authors intend to clarify the potential use of WSN technologies in industrial

    scenarios and guide application designers to select the most appropriate technology
    in each

    case. The layout of this brief perspective article is as follows: Section 2 presents
    a short

    Energies 2023, 16, 1349

    3 of 13

    overview of different IWSN technologies, including some implementation examples
    and

    domains. Finally, Section 3 draws some conclusions.

    2. State of the Art

    Industrial applications can be divided into six different classes depending on
    their

    requirements. Table 1 shows the classiﬁcation proposed by the ISA100 committee
    [11].

    These classes range from critical safety and control applications, which must
    satisfy very

    strict requirements in terms of latency, reliability, timing, and jitter, to monitoring
    applica-

    tions, in which failures have a limited impact. Table 1 also includes the typical
    accepted

    values for latency and packet loss probability [12], as well as some application
    examples.

    The most critical class involves safety applications, with strict requirements
    in terms of

    determinism, reliability, and data integrity. In these applications, latencies
    may reach values

    of up to 10 ms. Closed-loop regulatory control applications also have strong requirements,

    and the accepted latency values depend on the controlled process dynamics. Classes
    2

    to 5 have more relaxed requirements, due to their non-critical nature. Currently,
    wireless

    technologies are frequently accepted in non-critical operations, which typically
    involve

    monitoring, alerting, supervisory control, and data-logging tasks. In those applications,
    fail-

    ures do not produce severe consequences or economic losses. Thus, the most problematic

    applications for wireless technologies involve feedback control and safety operations
    [4].

    Wireless technologies are starting to be accepted in some closed-loop operations,
    notably

    in slow dynamics plants, in which the QoS provided by the WSN is able to ensure
    the

    required rate. Some application examples may be found in chemical, pulp and paper,
    or

    oil and gas industries [13]. These domains are especially suitable for wireless
    technologies

    due to the large areas covered, and the difﬁculties, costs, and safety problems
    that wiring

    may introduce.

    2.1. WiFi

    WiFi, the IEEE 802.11 standard, has come a long way since it was originally deﬁned
    in

    1997. There have been several reviews improving its behavior. IEEE 802.11b was
    the ﬁrst

    version massively adopted, after polishing the details of previous versions. Since
    then, WiFi

    has become a very common wireless technology in general-purpose systems. However,

    some characteristics of the standard, mainly the non-determinism caused by the
    MAC

    policies, make it not suitable for some industrial applications. Often, WiFi has
    been used as

    Energies 2023, 16, 1349

    4 of 13

    a gateway between wired or wireless LANs, and the Internet in industrial automation
    [14].

    Initially, WiFi was deployed over the 2.4 GHz ISM band. More recently, the 5 GHz
    band

    has been included. This approach may reduce interference problems between WiFi
    and

    other technologies that employ the overpopulated 2.4 GHz band. One of the disadvantages

    of WiFi, when compared to other wireless technologies, is power consumption. As
    a result,

    WiFi devices provide a shorter battery life than other technologies.

    The IEEE 802.11ax standard, commercially known as WiFi6, increments the scala-

    bility of the nodes connected to one access point. The use of some technologies,
    e.g.,

    orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA), multiple-user multiple-input

    multiple-output (MU-MIMO), or spatial frequency reuse, may help to deploy a high
    density

    of nodes avoiding collisions. WiFi6 claims a latency of 10 ms, which may be adequate
    for

    some industrial applications. WiFi6 may reach a data rate of up to 9.6 Gbps. This
    data rate

    can only be compared with the latest technologies, such as 5G networks.

    WiFi HaLow, or WiFi 802.11ah, follows a different approach. This technology seeks

    to adapt WiFi to the requirements of IoT systems. The coverage range is increased
    to

    around 1 km [15], the power for transmission is reduced, making it more suitable
    for

    battery-powered devices, and it is less affected by physical obstacles [16]. This
    is because it

    uses sub-GHz frequencies. However, WiFi HaLow presents some drawbacks: the data
    rate

    is lower than conventional WiFi, and it is not able to solve the problems of determinism

    and latency of WiFi.

    Since WiFi is widely spread, there have been interesting initiatives to develop
    WSN

    systems with real-time requirements. For example, Banz et al. (2020) [17] presented
    some

    amendments in the data link layer to allow control applications that require a
    data sample

    of up to 1 kHz. The authors tested their approach with a balancing robot as hardware

    in the loop. In [18], a similar approach was used. In this case, a sampling rate
    of 1 kHz

    was required by using advanced control techniques over a real Segway-type balancing

    robot. In the near future, the introduction of new technologies, such as WiFi6,
    may become

    a real alternative for time-critical control applications in industries. There
    are several

    monitoring and supervision use cases in the literature. For example, in [19],
    a scalable

    IoT architecture was presented based on the edge–fog–cloud paradigm for monitoring
    the

    Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) combining the use of MQTT over WiFi. The authors

    of [20] implemented a WiFi HaLow network-based information system for scenario-speciﬁc

    multi-sided applications for the coordination, documentation, and surveillance
    of rescue

    forces in mass casualty incidents.

    2.2. ZigBee

    ZigBee is a technology based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, which is used for
    low-

    energy communications with a low transmission rate [21]. It was developed in 2004
    by

    the ZigBee Alliance, now inside the Connectivity Standards Alliance (CSA). IEEE
    802.15.4

    deﬁnes the physical and MAC layers, whereas the network and application layers
    are

    deﬁned by the Alliance. It supports star, tree, and mesh topologies. The mesh
    topology

    tends to be the most used since the availability of redundant paths improves reliability.
    The

    star topology, on the other hand, reduces the latency and is the most adequate
    for achieving

    tight industrial requirements. ZigBee is conformed by three types of devices:

    •

    One coordinator per network that initializes, maintains, and manages the network;

    •

    Routers, which can ﬁnd paths for the messages from one node to another;

    •

    End devices, which are normally battery-powered. They collect and transmit data

    from sensors and may sleep and wake up to extend their battery life.

    ZigBee implements self-healing mechanisms in case of lost or changed status of
    node

    links. However, it does not implement any system to replace the coordinator in
    case of

    failure, with this node thus becoming a single-point failure [22]. In theory,
    ZigBee supports

    up to 65,000 nodes per network, but frequently, this number is more limited. The
    maximum

    distance between devices can reach 50 m. However, larger distances may be covered
    by

    hopping between the nodes.

    Energies 2023, 16, 1349

    5 of 13

    ZigBee has become a widely used technology in several domains, such as home

    automation. The major reason behind its popularity is its low cost. In fact, it
    is an open

    standard protocol without licensing fees for manufacturers. However, ZigBee is
    less

    capable of meeting the industrial requirements of deterministic latency and reliability.
    That

    makes ZigBee adequate for less critical tasks, such as monitoring and data acquisition,

    and, therefore, less suitable for security tasks. An important characteristic
    of ZigBee is that

    supports 868 MHz and 915 MHz radio bands, in addition to the 2.4 GHz band; therefore,
    it

    can help to avoid using the saturated 2.4 GHz band. This characteristic is important
    since

    ZigBee is a low-energy technology, and consequently, it is more inﬂuenced by networks

    such as WiFi.

    Common applications of ZigBee networks involve monitoring and data acquisition

    tasks. For example, in [23], the authors used a ZigBee network to monitor an industrial

    motor and predict maintenance needs using fuzzy logic. In [24], artiﬁcial intelligence
    was

    combined with a ZigBee network to reduce costs and energy consumption in a warehouse.

    There are efforts to implement control tasks using ZigBee networks, but they need
    to ﬁnd a

    solution in case of Qby oS degradation. This question has been tackled in different
    ways.

    For example, in [25], a two-level control scheme was presented. The highest level
    executes

    sophisticated algorithms, and in case of QoS degradation, the control tasks are
    shifted

    to edge devices with lower computing resources. This approach, tested over a robotic

    arm, avoids the system from becoming uncontrolled. This article proposes the use
    of the

    900 MHz radio band to avoid collisions between the ZigBee and 2.4 GH WiFi technologies.

    In [26], authors proposed a redundant wireless network based on ZigBee and WiFi
    to make

    the ship course-keeping control with a robust PID. Their approach adds compensation

    control of time delay and packet loss. Other attempts try to achieve higher determinism.

    For example, in [27], time-division multiple access (TDMA) policies were implemented

    according to a static schedule. They were applied in a high-precision, micro-positioning

    application with a piezoelectric actuator (PEA).

    An alternative to ZigBee is Z-Wave. This technology is similar to ZigBee. However,

    Z-Wave is a proprietary technology, provided by Silicon Labs. Although ZigBee
    is more

    common in industrial applications, the main advantages of Z-Wave result from its
    pro-

    prietary nature. The compatibility between devices is guaranteed. Z-Wave also
    provides

    better security mechanisms [28]. An example of Z-Wave use can be observed in [29],
    where

    a Z-Wave network is implemented to achieve real-time control in a smart home.

    2.3. WirelessHART

    WirelessHART is also based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. However, WirelessHART

    is used for building reliable and secure wireless network systems in industrial
    appli-

    cations [10,30]. It was introduced by HART Communication Foundation in 2007. The

    physical OSI layer is based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard, but WirelessHART speciﬁes

    the data, network, transport, and application layers. Transport and application
    layers are

    compatible between WirelessHART and the rest of the HART protocols. All devices
    are

    time-synchronized and communicate in pre-scheduled, ﬁxed time slots. This is achieved

    because this technology implements a TDMA network. The use of TDMA reduces colli-

    sions and saves power consumption in the devices. WirelessHART operates in the
    ISM

    2.4 GHz band. It implements some mechanisms to coexist in this band, such as Frequency

    Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS) which changes between channels avoiding interferences.

    WirelessHART allows for the use of star and mesh topologies, but star topology
    is not rec-

    ommended. One of the main advantages of WirelessHART is its low energy consumption.

    Battery-operated devices can reach a battery life of up to 10 years with sampling
    periods

    between 4 and 8 s [31]. All devices have routing capabilities. There are six types
    of devices

    in WirelessHART:

    •

    Field devices are connected to the sensors and actuators of the processes;

    Energies 2023, 16, 1349

    6 of 13

    •

    Router devices are not directly connected to the process. They only have communica-

    tion functionalities and are especially useful when the networks need to be improved

    or extended;

    •

    Adapter devices connect wired HART devices to wireless networks;

    •

    Handheld devices are used for installation, diagnosis, and maintenance operations;

    •

    Gateway devices connect the networks to the plant automation host. They translate

    among different protocols;

    •

    The network manager is responsible for managing the wireless network. This includes

    the following tasks: scheduling, network path conﬁguration, and reconﬁgurations.

    Only one node per network can be active as a network manager, but this technology

    allows a backup manager to take over in case of failures.

    WirelessHART also introduces several layers of protection. All trafﬁc is secured,
    and

    the payload is encrypted. All devices need a secret join key and a network ID
    in order to

    join the network.

    Previous characteristics make WirelessHART able to perform critical control tasks
    in slow

    dynamic processes. For example, in [32], a co-designed dynamic PIDPlus controller
    over

    the WirelessHART network was presented for the closed-loop control of slow-temperature

    processes. This work achieved the major requirements for industrial wireless control.
    In [33],

    WirelessHART was used to implement temperature control and device diagnostics.

    2.4. ISA 100.11a

    The International Society for Automation (ISA) proposed the ISA 100.11a standard
    in

    2007. This standard introduces a wireless low-bit rate, low-power technology designed
    for

    different tasks such as non-critical monitoring, alerting, supervisory control,
    and open- and

    closed-loop control applications [11]. The ISA 100.11a standard addresses the
    performance

    needs of those applications for latencies on the order of 100 ms. It uses the
    IEEE 802.15.4

    physical layer over the 2.4 GHz band and has a low data link layer. The MAC access

    is provided by means of TDMA, although it can also be implemented with CSMA-CA.

    For avoiding collisions in the 2.4 GHz band, it implements diverse mechanisms
    [34]. (1)

    Clear channel assessment (CCA): The device that initiates transmission checks
    whether

    the channel is busy and cancels the transmission when it is found busy; (2) spectrum

    management functionality: This mechanism limits the number of used channels to
    a subset

    of the available ones; (3) adaptive channel hopping: Devices autonomously avoid
    channels

    with a poor history of connectivity. The ISA 100.11a standard allows for the use
    of star and

    mesh topologies. There are different types of devices in the ISA 100.11a standard:

    •

    Routing end devices are the I/O devices, connected to the sensors and actuators,
    with

    routing capabilities;

    •

    Non-routing end devices are also I/O devices, but they lack routing capabilities;

    •

    Backbone routers are responsible for routing data packets from one subnet over
    the

    backbone network to its destination, which can be another subnet or the gateway;

    •

    Handheld devices are used for installation, diagnosis, and maintenance operations;

    •

    System manager, which is the administrator of the network responsible for the
    con-

    ﬁguration of the communication (e.g., resource allocation and scheduling), device

    management, and run-time control of the network;

    •

    Gateway, which acts as an interface between the ﬁeld network and the plant network

    (and control host applications);

    •

    Security manager, which is responsible for managing the security policy of the
    applications.

    The ISA 100.11a standard is designed for non-critical tasks. In fact, it can be
    introduced

    in control loops that involve slow dynamic processes. For example, in [35], the
    authors

    used the ISA 100.11a standard to control a tank level with a wireless control
    loop and a PID.

    The authors evaluated the performance of the standard, which can also provide
    wireless

    communications in harsh environments due to its robustness. In [36], a slightly
    modi-

    ﬁed version of the ISA 100.11a standard was used for communication tasks in a
    satellite,

    considerably reducing the wiring weight, which is a key limiting factor in satellite
    designs.

    2.5. WIA

    Wireless network for industry automation (WIA) includes three different standards
    [37]:

    The ﬁrst of them is WIA-PA for process automation, the second is called WIA-FA
    factory

    automation, and lastly, WIA-NR, which stands for new radio. Every standard combines
    dif-

    ferent technologies. WIA-PA implements the IEEE802.15.4 physical layer over the
    2.4 GHz

    band. The data link, network, and application layers are speciﬁcally deﬁned by
    the WIA

    standard. WIA-FA adopts the IEEE 802.11 physical layer, whereas the data link
    and ap-

    plication layers are deﬁned by the WIA standard. WIA-NR uses the physical layer
    and

    medium-access control sublayer of 5G and deﬁnes the application layer. Every standard

    adopts different topologies: WIA-PA supports star or hierarchical star–mesh topologies;

    WIA-FA implements a redundant star topology; and WIA-NR uses a hierarchical star

    topology that supports device-to-device (D2D) and coordinated multi-point (CoMP)
    com-

    munication. WIA introduces different methods to avoid collisions, such as multi-channel

    access, adaptive frequency hopping, and time synchronization schemes. In the application

    layer, WIA facilitates interconnection with other industrial communication technologies.

    The standard deﬁnes different types of devices:

    •

    Field devices are connected to the ﬁeld I/O devices, such as sensors and actuators;

    •

    Routing devices, access devices, and base stations (PA, FA, and NR, respectively),

    which are responsible for connecting ﬁeld devices with gateways;

    •

    Gateways provide a connection between the hosts and WIA networks. A redundant

    backup gateway can be added to increase the system’s robustness;

    •

    Handheld devices enable connection with the routing devices for installation,
    diagno-

    sis, and maintenance operations.

    Several works analyze the application of diverse WIA variants in process and factory

    automation tasks. An example of its implementation for factory automation is shown

    in [38], where a 1000-node plant was simulated, proving that WIA-FA is able to
    meet

    strict requirements in terms of reliability and timeliness in a large plant. In
    [39], the

    authors implemented a WIA-PA network for monitoring different processes. The WIA-NR

    technology proved to be able to meet high industrial requirements, with low latencies
    and

    reliability, as shown in [40].

    2.6. LPWAN

    Low-power, wide-area networks (LPWANs) are wireless networks that are used for

    long-range communications. They can be used to create networks that cover large
    areas,

    enabling IoT networks in large scales such as cities, rural environments, or agricultural

    ﬁelds. Due to the nature of the environments and devices, battery-powered devices
    are

    often used. The use of low-power communications increases the autonomy of the
    batteries,

    reaching years of battery life, since low-power, low-bit rates reduce consumption.
    This

    limitation makes them unsuitable for sending large volumes of data, but they are
    adequate

    for transmitting small volumes, such as the magnitudes captured with sensors or
    commands

    sent to actuators. Therefore, the main objectives of LPWANs are to achieve (1)
    long-range,

    (2) low-power, and (3) low-cost communications. Within the LPWAN communications,

    several speciﬁcations may be found. Below the most relevant ones are introduced,
    with

    special emphasis on LoRa, which is shown as an example of these technologies.

    LoRa is a type of LPWAN communication technology aimed to provide connectivity

    of battery-operated devices over a long-range, wide area [41]. In fact, LoRa stands
    for long

    range. Its physical layer is based on a proprietary spread spectrum modulation
    algorithm.

    LoRa uses different frequency bands depending on the region; for example, in Europe,

    LoRa is deployed over the 863-873 MHz band. The range that this technology covers

    varies depending on the terrain obstacles. For example, it typically reaches a
    5 km range

    in urban environments, but in more open environments, LoRa can achieve a range
    of

    more than 15 km. LoRa transmissions have very low power consumption, making this

    technology adequate for battery-powered devices. LoRa only deﬁnes the physical
    layer,

    whereas the data link and network layers are covered by LoRaWAN (long-range, wide-area

    Energies 2023, 16, 1349

    8 of 13

    network) [42]. LoRaWAN was deﬁned by the LoRa Alliance in 2015. It is a low-transmission

    rate technology able to achieve data rates between 0.3 kbit/s and 27 kbit/s. Three
    types of

    devices are deﬁned:

    •

    Class A devices are most of the time idle. Typically, these devices wake up when
    an

    event occurs, such as when a timer expires or a monitoring variable passes a threshold.

    Then, class A devices initiate the transmission and listen for a response. If
    nothing is

    received, devices go back to the idle status for a brief time interval and listen
    a second

    time for a response. If during this time, the devices do not receive any message,
    they

    go back to sleep until the next event occurs. There is no way to wake up externally
    an

    end device. These devices are only suitable for connecting sensors but not actuators.

    All LoRa devices must support the class A mode of operation.

    •

    Class B devices look for transmission windows in ﬁxed, synchronized, and regularly

    scheduled time intervals. They can also transmit deﬁned events since they implement

    class A behavior. These devices are suitable for carrying out periodic operations
    with

    both sensors and actuators.

    •

    Class C devices are always listening to messages unless they are sending data.
    For

    that reason, they have lower latency than all the LoRa class devices. Class C
    devices

    implement two receive windows as class A devices, but they never close the second

    window until the next transmission is sent. Therefore, they can receive a message
    at

    almost any moment. They are suitable for connecting sensors and actuators. As
    Class

    C devices must be operative all the time, they do not typically operate with batteries,

    but they must be connected to power all the time.

    LoRa networks consist of different devices, all of them providing unique identiﬁers.

    End devices are typically used to connect sensors or actuators. Gateways are used
    to

    bridge between LoRa networks and higher bandwidth networks such as WiFi, Ethernet
    of

    3G/4G/5G, or other IP-supported technologies. Multiple gateways can be connected
    in the

    same network, reducing the error rate. Finally, network servers manage the entire
    network,

    including the application and join servers. The joint servers allow the secure
    joining of

    the devices, as well as handling, managing, and interpreting the application data
    captured

    from the sensors. LoRa introduces several spreading factors to avoid collisions
    so that they

    appear as noise to one another. If packets have the same spreading factor, collisions
    can

    occur, but if one of the signals is 6 db stronger than the other, the stronger
    signal will prevail.

    The adaptive data rate (ADR) is essential to successfully implement LoRaWAN networks.

    The closest nodes to the gateway use a lower spread factor to reduce the transmission
    time.

    LoRa is suitable for long-range, low-energy communications, though the transmission

    speed is low. These characteristics make LoRa difﬁcult to use in closed-loop control

    applications. Use cases tend to address automation for devices distributed in
    wide areas.

    For example, Sánchez Sutil (2020) [43] developed a smart public lighting control,
    while

    Usmonov (2017) [44], the authors implemented a LoRa-based wireless control for
    a drip

    irrigation system, and in [45], an IoT multi-sensory platform was presented for
    agriculture

    monitoring and pump control. Due to the low cost and range capabilities of LoRa,
    there

    are attempts to modify it to make LoRa closer to industrial requirements. As an
    example,

    Fahmida (2022) [46] developed a real-time scheduling framework (RTPL) for LoRa
    to

    enable industrial automation. Their results showed that RTPL achieved, on average,
    a 75%

    improvement in real-time performance.

    There are other LPWAN speciﬁcations. The most important ones, along with LoRa,

    are Sigfox, NB-IoT, and LTE-M. Sigfox is developed by a French network global
    operator

    company of the same name. It uses the 868 MHz band in Europe and the 902 MHz band
    in

    the US. The use of ultra-narrowband allows low-energy communication that may cover

    large areas, with a maximum range of 30–50 km in rural areas. Its main characteristics
    are

    the use of differential binary phase-shift keying (DBPSK) and Gaussian frequency-shift

    keying (GFSK) and a one-hop star topology [47]. Sigfox operates with a closed
    IoT solution,

    but the chipset speciﬁcation is open to manufacturers. NB-IoT is a proprietary
    technology

    developed by 3GPP. NB-IoT focuses on indoor coverage. It uses a subset of the
    LTE standard

    Energies 2023, 16, 1349

    9 of 13

    but limits the bandwidth to a 200 kHz band [48]. Finally, LTE-M, also developed
    by 3GPP,

    relies on LTE machine-to-machine communications. The advantages of LTE-M over
    NB-IoT

    include its higher data rate, up to 1 Mbps [49], and better mobility, although
    it requires

    more bandwidth and is more costly. Both NB-IoT and LTE-M are still under development

    and are scheduled to be upgraded to be capable of achieving URLCC capabilities
    with

    the release-14 version [50]. Therefore, these technologies have the potential
    to be used in

    wireless networking if these objectives are fulﬁlled.

    2.7. BLE

    BLE was deﬁned in 2010 as part of the Bluetooth 4.0 speciﬁcation. BLE is a short-range,

    low-energy communication technology. Even though Bluetooth was initially conceived

    as a star topology, BLE stacks can be modiﬁed to support mesh topologies. Thus,
    the

    layers above the network layer must be changed to support BLE mesh [51,52]. The
    BLE

    physical layer has 40 channels on the ISM 2.4 GHz band. Three of them (channels
    37–39)

    are used as advertising channels (ACs) for device discovery, connection establishment,

    and broadcasting. The remaining 37 channels (0–36) are data channels (DCs), providing

    two-way data transfer. BLE implements the adaptive frequency hopping (AFH) technique

    between DC to minimize the effect of the interferences. The data link layer deﬁnes
    different

    roles for BLE devices. Speciﬁcally, there are three kinds of devices: masters,
    slaves, and

    advertisers. First, a device broadcasts its presence. When a connection is established
    with a

    central device, the central node acts as master and the peripheral device as slave.
    Devices

    can support different roles to create complex topologies. There have been several
    efforts to

    standardize BLE mesh, the most important of which are Bluetooth SIG: Bluetooth
    Smart

    Mesh and IETF: IPv6 over BLE mesh networks. However, the BLE mesh technology is
    not

    considered mature yet.

    Some efforts sought to implement real-time capabilities in BLE mesh networks.
    For

    example, in [53], multi-hop real-time wireless communications were achieved using
    the

    MRT-BLE protocol. Nevertheless, this approach only allows the deﬁnition of the
    topology

    ofﬂine, so there cannot be mobile nodes in the network, which is a clear limitation.
    Some

    implementation examples outside real-time domains can be found. For example, in
    [54], the

    authors used a BLE network to implement a position algorithm along with WiFi to
    make

    more accurate position identiﬁcation and tracking. Another example can be found
    in [55],

    where a BLE mesh was used to make a smart lighting control, extending the coverage
    area

    and increasing its ﬂexibility.

    2.8. 5G

    Cellular networks have come a long way since 1G was launched in the early 1980s
    [56].

    These technologies have evolved over the years, augmenting data transmission rates
    and

    security and reducing their cost. The introduction of 4G, in the 2010s, was an
    important

    achievement since it considerably enhanced the data rate. At the beginning of
    Industry

    4.0, despite its high cost, 4G became an important IoT technology for devices
    with high

    mobility. For example, in logistics, the capabilities of 4G facilitate digitization
    in the industry.

    More recently, in 2019, the ﬁrst commercial 5G networks were deployed. This technology

    promises to revolutionize the wireless communication paradigm, achieving more
    strict QoS

    requirements than actual wireless technologies. Notably, 5G uses a millimetric
    wavelength

    spectrum [57]. As a result, the range is more limited. For that reason, the deployment
    of 5G

    networks is based on a large number of small cellular stations, in contrast to
    the traditional

    large cellular towers, which can slow down its deployment outside urban areas.

    Currently, 5G is not a cost-effective technology for industrial applications.
    However, its

    price is expected to considerably reduce in the near future, thus opening new
    opportunities.

    Some experimental 5G technologies may reach 10 Gb/s transfer speeds. It also provides

    high scalability and massive machine-type communication (mMTC) since it may admit
    up

    to 100 nodes/m2. One of the key characteristics of 5G is that it provides ultra-reliable,
    low-

    latency communication (uRLLC). In fact, it is expected to have a latency value
    below 1 ms

    Energies 2023, 16, 1349

    10 of 13

    and a reliability rate of over 99.999%. If these ﬁgures are achieved, the requirements
    of many

    industrial applications would be satisﬁed. Indeed, it could become an alternative
    in devices

    with high mobility, such as autonomous guided vehicles (AGVs), robots, or logistics.

    Private 5G networks are particularly interesting in industrial applications [58].
    Private

    networks may provide dedicated coverage, which is key to having robust indoor
    networks

    even in remote areas. Furthermore, there is no contention for network resources
    as in public

    networks, adding reliability and robustness to the network. Intrinsic control
    of the network

    can be achieved. This allows the implementation of trafﬁc priorities or security
    policies

    to ensure data. Private networks can be customized to meet the speciﬁc requirements
    of

    diverse applications. All these characteristics make private 5G networks reliable
    and de-

    pendable. It is believed that 5G is going to be implemented in many industrial
    applications

    since 5G characteristics make it adequate to be used in IoT and IIoT applications.
    Many

    domains can beneﬁt from the massive introduction of 5G technologies, such as industrial

    automation (smart factories), automotive industry and smart cars, warehouse operations,

    utilities, industrial remote operation, intelligent transportation (logistics),
    mining operation,

    railway networks, healthcare, or smart grids and smart cities. Notably, 5G can
    be key

    in the achievement of tactile internet [59], becoming the communication technology
    for

    haptic systems. Applications in augmented reality, healthcare monitoring and intervention,

    navigation, and transportation are expected to be developed with this technology
    in the

    not-too-far future.

    Previously, 5G had to overcome some obstacles: Technological maturity, global
    stan-

    dardization, government regulations, and cost are the major concerns for massive
    5G

    adoption. Companies are especially reluctant to change. Signiﬁcant barriers were
    iden-

    tiﬁed such as data security and privacy, lack of standards, and challenges of
    end-to-end

    implementation [60]. The upgrade or replacement of networks to adopt 5G may involve

    design problems, training, and, inevitably higher costs [61].

    Other technologies are also available for WSN, such us RPMA, eMTC, EC-GSM IoT,

    Weightless, DASH7, Wi-Sun, and Matter-or-Thread protocol. However, at the moment,

    they are less common in Industry 4.0 applications.

    3. Conclusions

    Connectivity is a key issue in Industry 4.0 applications since it allows the introduction

    of new key concepts. Today, wired technologies prevail in industrial scenarios,
    and they

    will clearly remain in use in the future, especially in critical applications.
    However, the

    use of wireless networks achieves several beneﬁts when compared to wired technologies:

    They introduce higher ﬂexibility to modify the layout of the links; enhance the
    connectivity

    between taking nodes, sensors, and actuators; and eliminate wires, reducing the
    deploy-

    ment cost. In fact, they introduce new possibilities into Industry 4.0 applications
    since they

    facilitate connection with mobile devices or parts.

    Wireless communication technologies had already found a place in factories for
    non-

    critical operations, such as data acquisition, monitoring, and supervision. Failures
    in these

    tasks do not have severe consequences, which may involve the security of people
    and assets.

    However, the use of these technologies in critical applications, for example,
    in closed-loop

    control operations, is not mature yet. Some application examples may be found,
    especially

    in slow dynamic processes such as those found in the oil, gas, and chemical industries.

    However, this topic is still under research in academia.

    Currently, several protocols are available. Each technology may be valid for different

    scenarios. The development of the newest technologies, such as WiFi6 and 5G, could
    allow

    WSN to compete in performance with traditional wired communications. If they are
    capable

    of delivering such promising specs, the introduction of wireless technologies
    in factories

    may be disruptive. The ﬂexibility and scalability that offer wireless communications
    can

    make the factory evolve into more smart factories, ﬂexible enough to adapt quickly
    to the

    needs and circumstances of different products and productive environments. Nevertheless,

    there are obstacles to overcome. Factories are a really harsh environment for
    wireless

    Energies 2023, 16, 1349

    11 of 13

    technologies, due to several phenomena such as interferences, shadowing, or fading.

    Moreover, the cost of the deployment of these technologies is still high. In the
    short term, it

    is expected that both wired and wireless technologies coexist in factories. In
    the long run, it

    seems clear to the authors that wireless solutions are going to be massively deployed
    in

    the industry.

    This perspective article covered the most relevant technologies for use in industry.
    We

    sought to provide an overview of these technologies and some cases of use to illustrate

    their application in different domains. Thus, this study helps researchers and
    application

    designers to select the most appropriate technology in each case.

    \ Systems (CPS) have seen a dramatic increase in research and real-world application\
    \ in recent \nyears. Many parts of our everyday lives have been affected, including\
    \ electrical power systems, oil and gas delivery, \ntransportation networks, medical\
    \ equipment, home appliances, and a host of other areas. For example, many critical\
    \ \ninfrastructure and life support equipment are relying on these kinds of systems.\
    \ As a result, they are required to be \ncompletely secure and resistant to all\
    \ forms of assaults, which is almost unachievable for any real-world system. This\
    \ \npaper focuses on security analysis in CPSs, whereby security in CPSs, security\
    \ threats in CPSs, and security challenges in \nCPSs, have been discussed \n \n\
    Keywords – Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), Industrial Control Systems (ICS), Information\
    \ Technology (IT) \n \nI. \nINTRODUCTION \nCyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) [1] are\
    \ a new study topic that has the potential to bring together the physical and\
    \ digital \nworlds. In order to integrate the physical and digital worlds, these\
    \ systems use integrated components to perform tasks \ncollectively. CPSs have\
    \ grown more dispersed as a result of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the increased\
    \ complexity of \njobs, thus it is vital to design ubiquitous CPSs capable of\
    \ providing timely service delivery. A distributed CPS with \nmultiresolution\
    \ dynamism and connectivity allows for the efficient, reliable, safe and secure\
    \ administration of monitoring \nand management of physical objects in the real\
    \ world. Innovations such as Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), \ninteractive\
    \ platforms, and cloud technology have emerged in the construction of CPSs after\
    \ the merger of CPSs and IoT. \nThe potential of service-oriented CPSs has been\
    \ highlighted by the need of devices in CPSs to work together on both a \ncyber\
    \ and a physical scale. While the service-oriented methodology may be used to\
    \ create dispersed real-time CPSs that \ncan interact with real-world objects\
    \ in real-time, it is not adequate to fully realise complete distributed CPSs\
    \ that take into \nconsideration the interrelations between virtual and real elements.\
    \ A distributed embedded computing framework depends \non agents that are aware\
    \ of their context is therefore more appealing because it is possible to incorporate\
    \ various attributes \ninto agents and achieve distributed cloud computing with\
    \ improved coordination and interconnectivity between \nindependent and inhomogeneous\
    \ agents. When it comes to CPSs, context-awareness is a must, since this new technology\
    \ \nrelies heavily on sensors, resources, adaptability, and augmentation. Partial\
    \ observability in CPSs is a given, given the \ndynamic nature of distributed\
    \ CPSs domains. As a result, in order to get high model performance while using\
    \ ontology as \nthe underlying semantic technology, it is necessary to use uncertainty\
    \ modelling methodologies. \nThere are substantial challenges to the security\
    \ and privacy protection of CPS because of the complexity of CPS and its \nheterogeneity.\
    \ Cyber-physical interactions have made assessing threats and vulnerabilities\
    \ more challenging, and new \nsecurity concerns have arisen. Because the assaults\
    \ may come from various CPS components, tracing and examining them \nis particularly\
    \ complex. The construction of defensive systems requires an in-depth study of\
    \ the vulnerabilities, threats, and \nassaults. Identifying gaps, weak linkages,\
    \ and new avenues for investigation will be made possible by a review of current\
    \ \nCPS privacy and security measures. This paper focuses on security analysis\
    \ in CPSs, whereby security in CPSs, security \nthreats in CPSs, and security\
    \ challenges in CPSs, have been discussed. The remaining part of the paper has\
    \ been organized \nas follows. Section II focusses on the background analysis\
    \ of the paper. Section III focuses on a critical survey of the \nsecurity of\
    \ CPSs. Section IV finally draws conclusions to the paper and presents suggestions\
    \ for future studies.  \n \n \n \n \nISSN: 2788 –7669                        \

    \ and Computing 2(3)(2022) \n \n135 \n \n \nII. \nBACKGROUND ANALYSIS  \nCPSs\
    \ (Cyber Physical Systems) are IT structures integrated into real-world applications.\
    \ There are sensors and actuators \nincluded in these systems. Advances in information\
    \ and communications technology (ICTs) have resulted in a rise in the \ninterconnection\
    \ between physical processes. \n \nReal-life Application of CPSs \nIt is the current\
    \ iteration of instrumentation and control systems that can constantly monitor\
    \ the physical environment. \nCPSs are becoming more important in a wide range\
    \ of industries, including energy, aviation, and healthcare. As a very \nsignificant\
    \ and symbolic consideration, it is contingent on the technology used. An example\
    \ of a CPS is the SCADA, \nwhich is employed in CI, e.g., smart/intelligent grids\
    \ and industrial control systems, and wearable and implanted gadgets \n(utilized\
    \ in medical care). There are so many versions of CPSs that it would be impossible\
    \ to mention them all here, but in \nthis article, we'll focus on four examples\
    \ (see Table 1) of how CPSs might be used. \n \nTable 1. Examples of CPSs applications\
    \ \nApplication \nDetails  \nIndustrial Control \nSystems (ICS) \nNuclear power\
    \ facilities, water and sewage treatment plants, and irrigation systems all use\
    \ ICS \n(SCADA or distribution systems) to better their control and output. We\
    \ use a variety of \ncontrollers in ICS, including PLCs (Programmable Logic Controller)\
    \ [2]. You may use this \ngadget to accomplish a variety of goals by combining\
    \ its many features. A variety of actuators \nand sensors are being employed to\
    \ link this gadget to the real-world. This system has both \nwireless and cable\
    \ communication capabilities that may be employed depending on the \nenvironment.\
    \ Using PC systems, it is also possible to monitor and control systems in a control\
    \ \ncentre. \nSmart Grid Systems \nSmart grids are the next generation of grids\
    \ for producing energy, even though they have been \nin use for decades. By giving\
    \ consumers more control over their energy use at the local scale, it \nis both\
    \ economically and ecologically viable. In addition, it improves pollution management,\
    \ \nglobal load balance, and saves energy at the national scale. \nClinical Devices\
    \ \nIn an aim to render between medical care, clinical gadgets have been enhanced\
    \ with a \ncombination of cyber and physical capabilities. In order to help patients,\
    \ these medical gadgets \nmay either be implanted in the body or worn as wearable\
    \ devices. These gadgets are \nintelligent, and they can connect with other gadgets\
    \ using wireless technology. A programmer \nis responsible for establishing this\
    \ line of communication, which is necessary for performing \nsoftware updates\
    \ and configuration changes on the devices. Patients who use a wearable \ngadget\
    \ are more likely to keep track of their daily routines. \nSmart Vehicles \nSustainable,\
    \ fuel-efficient, cleaner and more convenient: these are the characteristics that\
    \ \ndistinguish smart cars from traditional automobiles. Electronic Control Units\
    \ (ECUs), a system \nof up to 70 computer networks, allowed these improvements.\
    \ ECUs are responsible for \noverseeing and controlling a variety of functions,\
    \ including machine emission controls, \nrecreation controls (audiovisual and\
    \ radio players), braking control, and recreational elements \n(cruise control,\
    \ and closing and window opening). To help alleviate traffic congestion and \n\

    \ critical in the \npresent era's technological landscape. \n \nDevelopments in\
    \ Clinical CPSs \nWe have analysed the wearable technology and IMDs, and now it's\
    \ time to talk about the relevance of CPSs in clinical \nuses, such as insulin\
    \ pumps, ventilation systems, and patient surveillance systems that are software-intensive.\
    \ Many \nindividuals are interested in these medical gadgets because they promise\
    \ to make their lives more comfortable and stress-\nfree (via determining causal\
    \ factors of diseases or treating diseases). Because of this, new difficulties\
    \ and possibilities for \nthe scientific community arise when big changes are\
    \ made to these devices. The following (see Table 2) are some of the \nmost common\
    \ developments in medical instruments: \nOverdosing should not be possible with\
    \ a properly set PCA device since it is meant to only deliver a certain number\
    \ of \ndoses, no matter how frequently the button is pushed. This safety system,\
    \ on the other hand, is insufficient to meet the \nneeds of all patients. Misprogrammed\
    \ pumps, pump developers who overestimate a patient's maximal dosage, drugs placed\
    \ \nincorrectly into the device, and PCA-by-proxy are just a few of the possible\
    \ causes of overdoses that may lead to death or \nserious illness in many patients.\
    \ It is not possible to address all of the clinical practise situations that PCA\
    \ infusion pumps \nare implicated in, even with established precautions like medication\
    \ libraries and programmable thresholds. Because of \nthis, we'll need more effective\
    \ medical gadgets to examine people in the near future (equipment are also required\

    \ are also increasingly being used to monitor a patient's \nheart rate, respiratory\
    \ rate, sugar levels, perceived stress, and body temperature. Despite this, since\
    \ they lack real-time \ndiagnostic ability, these instruments are limited to a\
    \ store-and-forward mode of operation and performance. Vital signs can \nbe monitored\
    \ in real time using closed-loop technologies in physiology, although this requires\
    \ continual attention. \n \nTable 2.  Common developments in medical instruments\
    \ \n \nDevelopment \nDetails \nNew software-enabled \nfunctionality \nEmbedded\
    \ system concepts [3] are used to bring new technology into medical equipment,\
    \ \nsuch as robotic surgery and proton therapy treatment, using software-based\
    \ design. Real-time \nprocessing of high-resolution pictures and haptic feedback\
    \ is required for this (robotic \nsurgery). In contrast, proton therapy treatment\
    \ is one of the most digital therapies and \nrequires one of the biggest clinical\
    \ device systems in the world. Patients with cancer get \nprecise treatment directions\
    \ from a cyclotron using a proton beam that give exact dosages of \nradiation.\
    \ Beam planning and projecting might potentially be disrupted by the fact that\
    \ the \nsame beam is disseminated to several patients and must be transferred\
    \ from place to site. \nResearch on the safety of proton beam machines has mostly\
    \ focused on one type in the last \ndecade, namely, devices that must be turned\
    \ off in an emergency. One of the key issues \nconfronting medical device makers\
    \ and the industry is how to properly analyse and evaluate \nsuch massive and\
    \ complicated structures. \nEnhanced connectivity of \nclinical gadgets \nNowadays,\
    \ health gadgets are connected with network connections since they increasingly\
    \ \ndepend on software. The usage of such interconnected healthcare devices allows\
    \ the creation \nof more decentralized structures of clinical devices, which have\
    \ to be planned properly and \nstructured to perform particular functions. Electronic\
    \ health records (EHRs) might be \nemployed to save patient data via the localized\
    \ or distant interconnection of these clinical \ndevices for tracking patients\
    \ or for tele-ICU telemonitoring in Electronic Health Records \n(EHR). As a consequence\
    \ of these limitations, novel treatment approaches and enhanced \npatient safety\
    \ may be achieved via the use of such healthcare devices in the present context.\
    \ \nMedical Device Plug-and-and-Play (MD PnP) interoperability approach is a standard\
    \ open \nframework for scalable and safe interconnections of clinical devices,\
    \ and for enhancing \npatient safety and efficacy within the healthcare system.\
    \ \nPhysiologically closed-\nloop systems \nIn most clinical facilities, a nurse\
    \ is assigned to keep an eye on the systems (or more than \none). During an operation,\
    \ an anaesthesiologist manages the patient's sedation and decides \nwhen to alter\
    \ the sedative stream. This reliance on \"person in the loop\" may jeopardise\
    \ \npatient safety, which is why some in the clinical community worry about it.\
    \ Nurses who are \noften overburdened and under tremendous time constraints may\
    \ overlook a critical warning \nsign. There may be times when nurses are unable\
    \ to care for numerous patients \nsimultaneously; however, they can operate a\
    \ device, which will be a significant assistance to \nthe nurse and enhance patient\
    \ safety and care. Nonetheless, even though the machine \n(computer) can never\
    \ replace the caregivers (in emotion), it may significantly reduce the \ncaregiver's\
    \ labour by bringing attention to the caregiver only when anything out of the\
    \ \nnormal occurs. The medical device industry has long employed case-based on\
    \ closed-loop \nphysiologic control. PCA (Patient-Controlled Analgesia) is a medical\
    \ condition that takes use \nof the closed loop technique [4]. Pain treatment\
    \ after surgery is usually achieved using PCA \ninfusion pumps. PCA pumps allow\
    \ patients to request a dosage at any time, rather than \nrelying on a caregiver's\
    \ set schedule for delivery. \nContinuous Monitoring \nand Care \nResidential\
    \ care, supported living, telehealth, and medical monitoring of sports activities\
    \ are \nbecoming more popular as an alternative to in-hospital treatment because\
    \ of their lower cost. \nRemote monitoring of patient and bodily functions is\
    \ feasible via mobile surveillance and \nhome automation. \n \nCyber, Network\
    \ and Data/Information Security  \nData security, of which cyber-security is a\
    \ subset, encompasses a broader range of concerns. Many different methods, \n\
    technologies or practises may be utilised to safeguard a firm’s networks and computers\
    \ against unauthorized accessibility, \ndamage or hazards. When it comes to protecting\
    \ both real and virtual material, InfoSec ensures that no one can get their \n\
    hands on it. In contrast to cyber-security, the objective of information security\
    \ (InfoSec) is to safeguard data in any format. \nWhen it comes to cyber dangers\
    \ like viruses, malware, and Trojan horses, network security is responsible for\
    \ protecting the \ncompany's IT infrastructure from all types of cyberattacks\

    \ \nSecurity in CPSs \nIn this section, we provide various instances to demonstrate\
    \ the criticality of safety to the CPS process. Cryptography, \naccess management,\
    \ penetration testing, and a slew of other concepts fall under the umbrella of\
    \ security control (used in IT \nmodels). When it concerns safeguarding an ICT's\
    \ infrastructure, they play a critical role [5]. There will be a lot of demand\
    \ \nfor error-free cyber physical systems in the near future. There will be many\
    \ more assaults like these in the future, therefore \nit's important to be prepared\
    \ now. Uses of CPSs as shown in Table 3 need various levels of security. \n \n\
    Table 3. Security breach of CPSs Applications \nCPSs Application \nDetails \n\
    Nuclear energy \nBased on the facts, it might be disastrous if the CPS lacks enough\
    \ protection. In the case of a \nnuclear facility, for example, the safety of\
    \ the CPS might be compromised, posing a global \nsecurity risk. As recently as\
    \ 2010, Iran's nuclear power reactors were targeted by an assault known \nas Stuxnet.\
    \ Big industrial control systems also have a large number of outdated systems.\
    \ In fact, \nthis also holds true. Over the past decade, several individuals have\
    \ worked on \"lightweight \ncryptographic mechanisms\" (mechanisms that make data\
    \ safe, accessible, and secure). However, \nmuch work remains to be done in each\
    \ of these areas. Make sure to take into account that some \nsecurity level is\
    \ preferable to none at all. An ICS's security is critical, and researchers must\
    \ do \ntheir share to ensure it. \nSmart Grid \nSecurity \nIf smart grid security\
    \ is breached, users might lose particular services and the utility agencies \n\
    might lose particular funds. It is also possible to target smart grids from a\
    \ distance, which might \nresult in widespread power outages. For example, malfunctioning\
    \ medical devices, information \nloss at the data center, and also enhanced crime\
    \ rate might occur if there are power or energy \nshortages. As a result, the\
    \ security of Smart Grid CPSs is fundamental (also to safeguard user data \nwithin\
    \ a system) \nPatient safety \nThe safety of patients might be jeopardised if\
    \ hacker-targeted wearables and IMDs are not \nadequately guarded. Licensing authorities\
    \ must be able to gain access to and utilize datasets, they \nhave to have the\
    \ capabilities to recognize, modifying, updating and ensuring that gadgets are\
    \ \naccessible to them. As a result, ensuring the safety of a medical app's users'\
    \ and patients' personal \ninformation is of paramount importance. \nAutomobile\
    \ \nindustry \nAutomobile manufacturers are always looking for innovative ways\
    \ to improve the usability and \ncomfort of their vehicles for their consumers.\
    \ Researchers aren't always thinking about safety \nwhen they create vehicles,\
    \ but that's a good thing to keep in mind. Security safeguards the \nvehicle's\
    \ capacity to continue operating in the event of a minor collision. In contrast,\
    \ safety was \nnot a segment of the design, but rather an added feature. For the\
    \ vehicle’s novel element to work, \nthey must be able to connect wirelessly and\
    \ physically. For the most part, smart cars rely on these \ntwo technologies to\
    \ protect them from most security breaches or attacks. We must find ways to \n\
    defend ourselves that are both secure and effective. \n \nIn order to adequately\
    \ safeguard CPSs, the underlying technologies should accomplish particular performance\
    \ \nnecessities. This allows for the implementation of proven safety systems and\
    \ standards. \n \nSecurity Parameters \nFor CPSs, there are a number of variables\
    \ to consider in order to ensure, which the system they protect are safe enough\
    \ \n(actual-work application). In order to protect CPSs, we must adhere to strict\
    \ security guidelines. \nIn recent years, it has become more evident that the\
    \ reliability of control functions is a critical component. The most \nsignificant\
    \ distinction between control schemes and IT security is the absence of patching\
    \ or updating requirements for \ncontrol systems. The process of upgrading a computer\
    \ may take months, for example. Stopping an industrial computer \nevery time a\
    \ new security patch is released is not worth the effort. After a software upgrade\
    \ on March 7, 2008, a gadget \ndesigned to monitor chemical data and diagnostic\
    \ datasets from the plant’s corporate systems began operations again. This \n\
    resulted in the shutdown of a nuclear power facility by accident. There was no\
    \ evidence that water reservoirs had \ndecreased, which meant that nuclear fuel\
    \ rods could not be kept cold. When the machine was rebooted, it generated this\
    \ \nerror. Autonomy is critical, but so is the requirement for decision-making\
    \ that occurs in real time (another management \n \nISSN: 2788 –7669         \

    \ Much attention has been paid to availability as a security concern. The real-time\
    \ operational \nenvironment, on the other hand, is more stringent than that of\
    \ most other IT systems. \nThe last portion of the report discusses the various\
    \ security factors and standards for CPSs (i.e., in intelligent control \nsystem,\
    \ intelligent grid system, etc.). In the sub-section below, we will discuss the\
    \ various forms of security threats in CPSs \n(i.e., intelligent grid system,\
    \ intelligent clinical devices, intelligent control schemes, etc.). \n \nSecurity\
    \ Threats in CPSs \nOur discussion of the security standards for four distinct\
    \ CPS applications may be found in the preceding section. For each \nof these\
    \ applications, we will now discuss some probable attacks. In this sub-section,\
    \ we're going to discuss about various \ndifferent cyber physical assaults. \n\
    \ \nReal-world cyber physical threats \nCPSs systems could be attacked by Physical\
    \ (P), Cyber-Physical (CP) and Cyber (C) threats, and how to prevent them [6].\
    \ \nThere are just a few recorded public assaults, and it's quite difficult to\
    \ get back or figure out exactly what occurred in the \nimmediate aftermath. In\
    \ this chapter, attacks are categorised according to the location of the injuries.\
    \ The term \"cyber\" \nrefers to assaults on computers that do not compromise\
    \ sensors or actuators. The term \"physical\" refers to assaults that \ntarget\
    \ specific physical components. When it comes to cyber-physical threats, on the\
    \ contrary, they are threats that attack \nphysical elements through the employment\
    \ of cyber elements. But extortion control systems have been around for a long\
    \ \ntime, so this is nothing new. Terrorism and physical violence are being employed\
    \ as a means of extortion in many nations. \nBecause they are quicker, cheaper,\
    \ and do not have to be constricted by distances, cyberattacks are a logical next\
    \ stage in \nthe development of physical assaults. The following are examples\
    \ of cyber and physical assaults against CPS that may now \nbe documented: \n\
    \ \nCyber attacks on cyber physical systems \nTable 4 presents the cyber-attacks\
    \ of CPSs. \nTable 4. Cyber-attacks of CPSs. \n \nAttack \nDetails \nIndustrial\
    \ Control \nSystem Attacks \nIran was hit by a \"Stuxnet\" assault in 2010 that\
    \ damaged many nuclear reactors. Iran has recently \nbeen the target of many cyberattacks\
    \ by cybercriminals from the United States. There have been \ntwo kinds of attacks\
    \ discovered against ICS. \n1. Communication protocols: In several cases, attackers\
    \ exploited holes in communication \nsystems. A SCADA system [7], for instance,\
    \ demonstrated how to evade the domain \nresolution protocol. \n2. Espionage:\
    \ Hacking ICS hacks like DuQu and Flame may be exploited to spy on \nindividuals.\
    \ A number of ICS networks were detected in the Mideast in 2012 by Flame, \nfor\
    \ example The primary purpose of this spyware was to steal confidential information\
    \ \nfrom businesses, such as their locations and the passwords they entered into\
    \ their \ncomputers. \nIn many nations, intruders who are not authorized are attacking\
    \ them on a daily basis. At this \npoint, governments are employing these assaults\
    \ as a weaponry to inflict maximum harm on their \nadversary (the enemy). \nSmart\
    \ Grid CPS \nAttack \nCPS assault on a Central Processing System (CPS). The most\
    \ frequent occurrence is a total power \noutage. Smart grids are vulnerable to\
    \ cyberattacks, which might result in a complete blackout in a \nnation. It was\
    \ quite significant whenever it happened in USA and Europe a few times over the\
    \ past \n10 years. \nClinical CPS attack \nIn a distributed framework, insider\
    \ threats, spies and other types of threats are probable. This is a \nmajor danger.\
    \ Medical gadgets may be tampered with or hacked by an insider, allowing him to\
    \ \ncontrol the machinery in any way he sees fit. The wireless transmissions that\
    \ medical gadgets use \nto keep individuals healthier might easily be jammed by\
    \ an invader. In this case, the gadget would \nbe rendered useless and would not\
    \ be able to render the necessary treatments. \nIntelligent Vehicles \nAttack\
    \ \nTaking control of a motor vehicle or automobiles from a specific distance\
    \ or through an assault \nfrom the outside is a major security issue. An assailant\
    \ might take control of any car, which could \nresult in a major traffic incident.\

    \ Machines compromised with the Slammer worm at the Davis Besse power company\

    \ Maroochy Shire Council in Queensland, Australia, was attacked in \n2000, on\
    \ the sewage control system (that was undertaken by disgruntled ex-worker of the\
    \ contractor company, which has \nestablished the control systems). In this part,\
    \ we'll look at an example of a threat framework in CPS. \n \nAdversary Framework\
    \ in CPS \nIdentifying potential threats to a system's security requires an in-depth\
    \ investigation. An adversary model can be used to \nassess the scope and severity\
    \ of a problem. Cybercriminals have been breaking into computers all over the\
    \ world for the \nbetter part of the last decade or so (even in control models).\
    \ Control systems compromised with malware might not work as \nplanned. From a\
    \ safety perspective, these attacks are critical because they are the result of\
    \ unauthorised access to control \nsystems' computers and networks. Attacks by\
    \ insiders can occur even when control networks are completely isolated from \n\
    the public Internet and other networks. Currently, targeted computer attacks are\
    \ primarily perpetrated by disgruntled \nemployees. Most of the time, these employees\
    \ don't collaborate with each other. \" Larger, better-coordinated groups can\
    \ do \nmore damage, but these individuals may not. As a major issue in CPS, this\
    \ one necessitates a solution that is both practical \nand realistic. \nCriminal\
    \ groups and terrorists may try to access the security models. Presently, there\
    \ are no proofs that terrorists and \nactivists have used computer threats to\
    \ access controllers. Although criminal clusters may be involved, there is some\
    \ \nevidence. CPS initiatives aren't new, but they're gaining in popularity these\
    \ days because of how much money they can \nmake. Iran and Iraq, for example,\
    \ have been subjected to physical attacks in the last few years as a result of\
    \ this tactic. \nCyberattacks on other nations' physical infrastructure will become\
    \ more commonplace in the near future. Table 5 depicts \nthe concept of attacks\
    \ and consequences of attacks.  \n \nTable 5. Concepts of Attacks and Consequences\
    \ \nConcept \nDetails  \nAttacks  \nResonance assaults on control systems may\
    \ be used by attackers to gain access (i.e., threats that are \nnon-feasible in\
    \ more conventional information technology schemes). Someone tampered with some\
    \ of \nthe sensors or controls, causing physical systems to oscillate at a natural\
    \ frequency.  \nConsequences of \nAttacks  \nWe're not aware of anybody who's\
    \ done research on the potential consequences of assaults on critical \ninfrastructures.\
    \ A person may get entry to a control scheme that does not correspond to them\
    \ via \nSCADA security reports, which may look like overreaction. The majority\
    \ of controllers have \nsafeguards in place to prevent catastrophic failures.\
    \ \n \nSecurity challenges in cyber physical systems \nAll of these terms, as\
    \ well as others, are intertwined in this piece of writing (paper). We define\
    \ challenges as unanswered \nproblems, and our goal is to entice individuals to\
    \ do more investigation to discover solutions. An internal (security) \nweakness\
    \ that may be exploited by intruders is referred to as a \"vulnerability.\" Things\
    \ that potentially harm a system are \nknown as threats. \n \nOverall  CPSs security\
    \ Isues \nSecurity based on Design  \nSince most CPS are not linked to other systems\
    \ like the web, they are not meant to be secure. CPS are not linked to other \n\
    networks, which implies that cybersecurity isn't taken into concern while designing\
    \ them. Keeping people secure, then, was \nmostly a matter of physical security.\
    \ \n \n Cyber Physical Security \nKeeping people secure, then, was mostly a matter\
    \ of physical security. Designers of CPSs must rethink security from a \ncyber\
    \ and physical perspective if they are to succeed. Our ability to foresee and\
    \ prevent new cyber-attacks which have \nphysical implications should be improved.\
    \ There is a need to develop infrastructure for resolution components (cyber-\n\
    physical technologies), which have hitherto been dismissed.  \n \nReal-Timeliness\
    \ Nature \nIn case a certain criterion in real-time is not reached, it has a direct\
    \ impact on the condition of defence. In order to survive \nan assault, networks\
    \ rely on CPS to make timely judgments. CPS security that considers the interplay\
    \ between real and \nvirtual factors may be shown to the whole globe. Better risk\
    \ evaluation and threat detection may be achieved by using this \nmethod. Since\
    \ cryptographic techniques must be put on top of these approaches to facilitate\
    \ real-time interoperability, \nwhich is what ought to occur. \n \n \n \nISSN:\

    \ \n \nUncoordinated Changes \nThe CPS employs a large number of employees. Those\
    \ who manufacture, use, own, and operate goods are all included, as \nare those\
    \ who work for them. They need to be well managed, even if their jobs and responsibilities\
    \ are distinct. This shift \nwill need the attention of many personnel and several\
    \ CPS divisions (an issue that we must not ignore). Stakeholders in a \nCPS community\
    \ should coordinate their efforts at some point. Upgrading hardware, upgrading\
    \ or modifying software, and \nintroducing new features are all examples of methods\
    \ to improve things. A country's security may be jeopardised if \nunanticipated\
    \ improvements to CPSs security (i.e., novel flaws) were to occur. \nIndustrial\
    \ Control System Issues \nChange Management \nNumerous Internet of Things (IoT)\
    \ gadgets must be removed or modified in ICS environments. Replacement, \nmodification,\
    \ or deletion of these systems is required (at one place). ICS system updates,\
    \ for example, must be scheduled \nmeticulously in order to minimise issues. The\
    \ ICS system's security plan may change without the awareness of many \ninvestors;\
    \ therefore, we must organize change controls in order to monitor and prevent\
    \ security-based changes within \nCPSs. \nMalicious Insider \nDue to the fact\
    \ that the assault originates from inside the organisation, tracking down and\
    \ stopping a hostile insider are very \ndifficult tasks. Internal attacks like\
    \ those in Maroochy’s sewage system and water supply, or Stuxnet, might be launched\
    \ by \nan insider who has the trust and inside knowledge necessary to carry out\
    \ the attack. This is only one illustration of what \nmay be accomplished (via\
    \ a USB stick). Insiders may unintentionally utilise virus-attacked computers\
    \ or USB sticks, \namounting in ICS entry points being made available to unauthorised\
    \ users. Finding out who is an internal attacker has been \nthe main difficulty\
    \ that many independent researchers have neglected or ignored. \nSecure Integration\
    \ \nTo prevent new security issues, new components must be integrated into existing\
    \ systems in a secure manner. It's important \nto keep in mind that the ICS depends\
    \ heavily on out-of-date technology that might be susceptible. In order to make\
    \ ICS as \nsafe as possible, all of the old components must be removed and new,\
    \ safer ones installed. So, short-term fixes are needed \nto avoid any difficulties\
    \ with ICS. \n \nSmart grids challenges \nTable 6 presents the challenges in the\
    \ smart grid. \nTable 6. Smart grid challenges \nChallenge \nDetails \nChange\
    \ \nManagement  \nSmart grid adjustments aren't any simpler to cope with than\
    \ ICS updates, but they're also not much \neasier. Even while smart grids are\
    \ increasingly complex and include a greater number of people, \nthey are unable\
    \ to adapt to changes. It necessitates the use of change management in order to\
    \ keep \nsmart grids healthy. \nTwo-Way \nCommunications \nThe Advanced Metering\
    \ Infrastructure (AMI) [8] in an intelligent grid allows for two-way \ncommunication.\
    \ Consumers' residences are less of a target for physical attacks since AMI smart\
    \ \nmetres can connect with utility providers that are nearby, unlike the power\
    \ grid. Since the \nintroduction of smart grids, keeping these gadgets secure\
    \ has grown increasingly complex. \nAccess \nControl \nMechanisms  \nWith a vast\
    \ reach and many investors, smart grids require strong access control systems\
    \ to keep \nthem safe. It is critical to keep watch on and regulate any potential\
    \ accessibility to the smart grid \nsystem, data, or gadgets. Whenever possible,\
    \ it is important to empower the individuals or \norganisations that are meant\

    \ are common. Increasing use of smart grids has \nmade this an issue for many\
    \ individuals. Moreover, it is essential to provide anonymization \nstrategies\
    \ to prevent attackers from deducing trends or encrypted information to disclose\
    \ sensitive \ninformation. The term for this is \"anonymization.\" As a result,\
    \ we must ensure that the methods \nwe design can encode and consolidate data\
    \ securely. \nExplicit Trust \nWe should just not put any faith in the perceived\
    \ data or directives that have been transmitted in \nthis circumstance. Instead,\
    \ new methods must be devised to recognise bogus data and actions that \nare not\
    \ permitted. Because smart grids are so big, it might be difficult to employ algorithms\
    \ that \njust search for faults to identify FDI assaults. \nComprehensive \nSecurity\
    \ \nSmart grids benefit from having high levels of security. Even at the lowest\
    \ levels, it's a problem \n(as a result of limited capacities in devices on the\
    \ lower level). There might be variations in the \nnumber of securities, which\
    \ has to be in place at every level as a consequence. Several academic \nresearchers\
    \ have to come up with compact technologies in order to achieve this. Encryption\
    \ is also \ncritical for maintaining the privacy and security of data at all layers\
    \ of the smart grid. This is to \nensure that there is no security breach at any\
    \ time. \n \nISSN: 2788 –7669                                                \

    \ by enabling it to \ntreat people in the most appropriate method for them at\
    \ the moment. The loop should be \nsecurely and swiftly closed in this manner.\
    \ \nSecurity and Privacy \nBecause MCPSs gather health records and organize the\
    \ information they acquire, security \nand privacy are of the utmost importance.\
    \ As a result, it's critical that no unauthorised party \nhas access to or alters\
    \ their data. A patient's privacy, discrimination, abuse, or even physical \n\
    harm might result from such an act. \nCertifiability \nMCPS requires a low-cost\
    \ method of demonstrating that biomedical device software is safe \nand dependable,\
    \ e.g., clinical device certifications. \nExecutable clinical \nworkflows \nMCPS\
    \ may be built and deployed fast in order to deliver effective medical services\
    \ for a \n(particular) patient since more and more healthcare systems are connecting\
    \ and working \ntogether. With MCPS, patients' security is the foremost concern.\
    \ Consequently, we must \nguarantee patient safety in these cases by employing\
    \ medical protocols that are legitimate \nand effective. \nModel-based Development\
    \ \nPrior to building or developing a software system, we will be able to determine\
    \ how safe \nthe situation is for patients, and we will be able to establish requirements\
    \ for safe equipment \nand their connections. To ensure that the application is\
    \ safe, these standards may be \ninspected during deployment. Take note of the\
    \ way scenario analysis is carried out using \nMCPS model-based growth. Static\
    \ and dynamic vulnerability checks are the most difficult \nto understand. \n\
    Physiological close-loop \ncontrol \nMany individuals dislike employing automated\
    \ control in medical treatment for a variety of \nreasons, including regulating\
    \ an application to a specific location, doing many treatments at \nonce that\
    \ might influence a variety of bodily system in patients. It should be noted that\
    \ \nexperiences will be unique.  \nPatient Simulation and \nModelling \nPatient\
    \ modelling is essential if we are to analyse how distinct conditions and closed-loop\
    \ \ncontrols operate. It is fundamental to keep watch on elements such as clients’\
    \ respiratory \nand heart rates in closed-loop PCA circumstances, as well as how\
    \ much medication is being \nabsorbed. More basic ways are needed to assist us\
    \ in solving the difficulty of developing \nand analysing things. These techniques\
    \ have the potential to simplify certain complex \nmodels. \nAdaptive Patient\
    \ and \nsmart alarms \nThe majority of medical equipment is designed for use with\
    \ several patients (having the \nsame medical clinical conditions). In MCPS, patients\
    \ may have a wide range of reactions to \ntherapy, which may lead to confusion\
    \ and loss of time. Most medical gadgets, for example, \nwill sound an alert if\
    \ a potentially harmful situation is discovered. Medical gadgets might \npotentially\
    \ mistakenly send out false alerts. They don't have to deal with stuff like this\
    \ in \ntheir line of work. For the benefit of patients and the collection of data\
    \ for use in the \ncreation of EHR Systems, healthcare systems are now establishing\
    \ reliable network \nconnections to accomplish this goal. \nIn such situation,\
    \ we'll need algorithms that can be customised to meet the unique \nrequirements\
    \ of each patient. Using the patient's activity record in EHR, we aim to alter\
    \ \nalert settings so that there are less false alarms as well. Using \"smart\
    \ alarm services\" in \nmedical equipment in the near future will reduce the number\
    \ of false alerts. \nUser Centred Design \nIf the caregiver is overworked or anxious\
    \ or has difficulty operating a piece of equipment, \nthey may make errors in\
    \ their care. There are a number of ways that medical devices may \nbe designed\
    \ to be more user-friendly, such as providing interactive methods to learn how\
    \ to \noperate the device in the event that the user gets stuck, and providing\
    \ means for users to \nrectify errors so that they are satisfied with their gadgets.\
    \ \nInfrastructure for \nMedical-Device \nIntegration and \nInteroperability \n\
    Distributed MCPS that use an exclusive network communication are currently being\
    \ \ndeveloped by just one business (lessening inter-device communication's advantages,\
    \ while \nmaking regulatory clearance more straightforward). Open standards (interconnectivity)\
    \ are \nthe standard in the MCPS industry (establishing the foundation for medical\
    \ device \ninteroperability). It's still necessary for these standards to be utilised\
    \ on systems that are \nsimple to create and use. They must follow specific guidelines\
    \ while making their goods so \nthat they may function together and interface\
    \ with each other in order to obtain the greatest \nbenefit from them. \nCompositionality\
    \ \nUsing methods like contextual induction, it is possible to better understand\
    \ how linked \ndevices interact with one another, hence enhancing the security\
    \ of MCPS systems. Figuring \nout how medical gadgets could interact in unexpected\
    \ ways is the most challenging thing to \n \nISSN: 2788 –7669                \
    \                                                                         Journal\
    \ of Machine and Computing 2(3)(2022) \n \n143 \n \nundertake in this scenario.\
    \ Due to their proximity to one another, radio interference may \noccur between\
    \ medical equipment that provide various therapies to the same patient. \nTreatments\
    \ might conflict with one another if the body's response to them changes. A good\
    \ \nexample of this is \"mixed prioritisation\". The sensor's position in regard\
    \ to the patient \ndetermines the MAP measurement's accuracy. The MAP measurement\
    \ changes when the \npatient's bed, which is a Class I medical equipment, is elevated,\
    \ since it is the least \nsignificant in the FDA classification. False reports\
    \ or other undesirable behaviour might \nresult from the sensor's abrupt shift\
    \ when it is component monitoring things like vital signs. \nThis issue was utilised\
    \ to provide the monitoring system with more information. Making \nthese gadgets\
    \ while taking into account is difficult. \nPrivacy and Security \nThere are a\
    \ number of networking capabilities built into medical equipment that, when \n\
    combined, might contribute to security and privacy concerns. If a hacker gains\
    \ entry to the \nMCPS network, they might hurt or even kill individuals (by re-programming\
    \ devices). \nRehired gadgets that may be rehired through the local area network\
    \ but do not get any \nrequests from the networks might be restricted in this\
    \ way. There must be a delicate \nbalancing between freedom of travel and the\
    \ requirement for security. A strategy is needed \nfor coping with EHR system\
    \ problems. \nVerification, Validation \nand Certification \nWhen the design is\
    \ complete, verification and validation are performed. Currently, this is \nhow\
    \ things are going. By using a \"design for verification approach,\" it will be\
    \ possible to \ndemonstrate the validity of the verification process on an ever-larger\
    \ scale [10]. It is also \npossible to do verification earlier in the design process\
    \ thanks to a technology known as \nmodel-based generative approaches. Keep in\
    \ mind that run-time components may be \ncreated from medical devices. \nHigh\
    \ Assurance Software \nSome elements of medical equipment, such as hardware (such\
    \ as security locks) and other \nthings, are automated with the help of technology.\
    \ It is commonly accepted that software \ndevelopment is essential to the security\
    \ of MCPS, however this is not enough. \n \nIV. \nCONCLUSION AND FUTURE RESEARCH\
    \ \nThis paper focuses on security analysis in CPSs, whereby security in CPSs,\
    \ security threats in CPSs, and security \nchallenges in CPSs, have been discussed.\
    \ A contemporary Cyber Physical Systems (CPSs) is at its peak in terms of \nengineering,\
    \ making it intricate and multi-scale structures that are versatile. The systems\
    \ are employed in various fields in \nreal-life, and they have significantly attracted\
    \ the attention of researchers and the academia. CPSs have not become \npopular,\
    \ but there are some major segments of the fields, which are not appropriately\
    \ defined or that not sufficiently \nstudied. It necessitates more efforts to\
    \ make CPSs function in real-life. This incorporates a broader range of \ninterdisciplinary\
    \ expertise, as well as tighter integration of important enabling technologies\
    \ and a focus on environmental \nand societal concerns. It is essential for networks\
    \ to have a shared language, abstract structures, modeling techniques, and \n\
    protocols that function together in a coordinated manner. In order for abstraction\
    \ to work properly in CPS testing, \nexecution, design, and conceptualization,\
    \ all of these processes need strong methodologies and theories (also computational\
    \ \nand conceptual abstraction, i.e., that are fundamental for both computer and\
    \ human agents). Computational reasoning has \nto be employed for autonomous control\
    \ systems (for the physical system) and for discrete virtual structure (of the\
    \ physical \nsystem) in order to facilitate the writing, connecting, and building\
    \ of CPSs (with high integration levels). Different \nconcepts, e.g., time-correct\
    \ controls and operations, compositionality, synergy and goal-centric learning,\
    \ among others, \nalso require investigation in future studies.  \n \nReferences\

  explanation: '**Closed-Loop Control and Feedback Mechanisms**


    In autonomous irrigation systems, closed-loop control and feedback mechanisms
    play a critical role in ensuring efﬁcient and effective water management. These
    mechanisms continuously monitor various parameters related to the irrigation process,
    such as soil moisture, crop water needs, and weather conditions, and then use
    this information to adjust the irrigation schedule and water amount accordingly.


    **Concept and Implementation**


    The concept of closed-loop control in autonomous irrigation systems involves collecting
    real-time data from sensors, processing the data to make informed decisions, and
    adjusting the irrigation system based on those decisions. This continuous feedback
    loop helps the system adapt to changing conditions and optimize water usage.


    **Types of Feedback Mechanisms**


    **Soil Moisture Sensors:** These sensors measure the moisture level in the soil
    and provide real-time data on the water content available to plants. This information
    is crucial for determining when and how much to irrigate.


    **Weather Stations:** Weather stations collect data on temperature, humidity,
    rainfall, and wind speed. This information helps the system adjust irrigation
    schedules based on weather forecasts and reduce water usage during periods of
    high rainfall or humidity.


    **Crop Water Sensors:** These sensors measure the water status of plants by monitoring
    their physiological responses. They can provide data on plant water potential,
    stomatal conductance, and transpiration rates. This information helps the system
    optimize irrigation based on the speciﬁc needs of the crops.


    **Algorithms and Automation:** The collected data is processed using algorithms
    that determine the appropriate irrigation schedule. These algorithms consider
    factors such as soil moisture levels, crop water needs, weather forecasts, and
    historical data to make informed decisions about irrigation timing, duration,
    and amount.


    **Benefits of Closed-Loop Control**


    * **Increased Water Efﬁciency:** Closed-loop control systems ensure that crops
    receive the precise amount of water they need, minimizing water wastage and optimizing
    yields.

    * **Reduced Labor Costs:** Automated irrigation systems eliminate the need for
    manual monitoring and adjustment, saving time and labor costs.

    * **Improved Crop Health:** Optimal irrigation practices promote healthy crop
    growth, reducing the risk of water stress and disease.

    * **Environmental Sustainability:** Efﬁcient water usage conserves this precious
    resource and reduces environmental impact.

    * **Data-Driven Decision-Making:** The continuous feedback loop provides valuable
    data that can be analyzed to improve irrigation strategies and make informed decisions
    about crop management practices.


    **Challenges and Future Directions**


    While closed-loop control offers signiﬁcant beneﬁts, there are still challenges
    to address, such as sensor accuracy, data reliability, and the need for robust
    algorithms. Future research and development will focus on enhancing these aspects
    to further improve the precision and effectiveness of autonomous irrigation systems.'

    \ Experimentation and Testing\nAbstract\nThe IoT European Large-Scale Pilots Programme\
    \ includes the innovation\nconsortia that are collaborating to foster the deployment\
    \ of IoT solutions\nin Europe through the integration of advanced IoT technologies\
    \ across the\nvalue chain, demonstration of multiple IoT applications at scale\
    \ and in a usage\ncontext, and as close as possible to operational conditions.\n\
    The programme projects are targeted, goal-driven initiatives that propose\nIoT\
    \ approaches to speciﬁc real-life industrial/societal challenges. They are\nautonomous\
    \ entities that involve stakeholders from the supply side to the\ndemand side,\
    \ and contain all the technological and innovation elements,\nthe tasks related\
    \ to the use, application and deployment as well as the\ndevelopment, testing\
    \ and integration activities.\nThis chapter describes the IoT Large Scale Pilot\
    \ Programme initiative\ntogether with all involved actors. These actors include\
    \ the coordination and\nsupport actions CREATE-IoT and U4IoT, being them drivers\
    \ of the pro-\ngramme, and all ﬁve IoT Large-Scale Pilot projects, namely ACTIVAGE,\n\
    IoF2020, MONICA, SynchroniCity and AUTOPILOT.\n8.1 IoT European Large-Scale Pilots\
    \ Programme\nThe scope of the IoT European Large-Scale Pilots Programme is to\
    \ foster the\ndeployment of IoT solutions in Europe through the integration of\
    \ advanced\nIoT technologies across the value chain, demonstration of multiple\
    \ IoT appli-\ncations at scale and in a usage context, and as close as possible\
    \ to operational\nconditions. Speciﬁc pilot considerations include:\n• Mapping\
    \ of pilot architecture approaches with validated IoT reference\narchitectures\
    \ such as IoT-A enabling interoperability across use cases.\n• Contribution to\
    \ strategic activity groups that were deﬁned during the\nLSP kick-off meeting\
    \ to foster coherent implementation of the different\nIoT Large-Scale Pilots.\n\
    • Contribution to clustering their results of horizontal nature (interoper-\n\
    ability approach, standards, security and privacy approaches, business\nvalidation\
    \ and sustainability, methodologies, metrics, etc.).\nThe IoT European Large-Scale\
    \ Pilots Programme includes projects address-\ning the IoT applications based\
    \ on European relevance, technology readiness\nand socio-economic interest in\
    \ Europe. The IoT Large-Scale Pilot projects\noverview is illustrated in Figure\
    \ 8.1, and the areas addressed by the projects\nare listed below.\n8.1 IoT European\

    \ Programme Projects Overview.\nResearch and innovation effort in speciﬁc IoT\
    \ topics ensure the longer-\nterm evolution of Internet of Things and the IoT\
    \ European Large-Scale Pilots\nProgramme projects are addressing:\n• The integration\
    \ and further research and development, where needed,\nof the most advanced technologies\
    \ across the value chain (components,\ndevices, networks, middleware, service\
    \ platforms, application functions)\nand their operation at large scale to respond\
    \ to real needs of end-users\n(public authorities, citizens and business), based\
    \ on underlying open\ntechnologies and architectures that may be reused across\
    \ multiple use\ncases and enable interoperability across those.\n• The validation\
    \ of user acceptability by addressing, in particular, issues\nof trust, attention,\
    \ security and privacy through pre-deﬁned privacy and\nsecurity impact assessments,\
    \ liability and coverage of user needs in the\nspeciﬁc real-life scenarios of\
    \ the pilot.\n• The validation of the related business models to guarantee the\
    \ sustain-\nability of the approach beyond the project.\nThe IoT Large-Scale Pilots\
    \ make use of the rich portfolio of technologies\nand tools so far developed and\
    \ demonstrated in reduced and controlled\nenvironments and extend them to real-life\
    \ use case scenarios with the goal of\nvalidating advanced IoT solutions across\
    \ complete value chains with actual\nusers and proving its socio-economic potential.\n\
    Support actions provide consistency and linkages between the pilots and\ncomplement\
    \ them by addressing horizontal challenges critically important\nfor the take-up\
    \ of IoT at the anticipated scale. These include ethics and\nprivacy, trust and\
    \ security, respect for the scarcity and vulnerability of human\n224\nIoT European\
    \ Large-Scale Pilots – Integration, Experimentation and Testing\nattention, validation\
    \ and certiﬁcation, standards and interoperability, user\nacceptability and control,\
    \ liability and sustainability.\nThe projects together form the IoT European Large-Scale\
    \ Pilots Pro-\ngramme and a coordination body ensures an efﬁcient interplay of\
    \ the various\nelements of the IoT Focus Area and liaises with relevant initiatives\
    \ at EU,\nMember States and international levels. The coordination is implemented\
    \ by\nthe creation of Activity Groups that are addressing topics of common interest\n\
    across the Large-Scale Pilots.\n8.2 ACTIVAGE – Activating Innovative IoT Smart\
    \ Living\nEnvironments for Ageing Well\nACTIVAGE is a European Multi Centric Large-Scale\
    \ Pilot on Smart Liv-\ning Environments. The main objective is to build the ﬁrst\
    \ European IoT\necosystem across 9 Deployment Sites (DS) in seven European countries\
    \ (see\nFigure 8.2), reusing and scaling up underlying open and proprietary IoT\
    \ plat-\nforms, technologies and standards, and integrating new interfaces needed\
    \ to\nprovide interoperability across these heterogeneous platforms. This ecosys-\n\
    tem will enable the deployment and operation at large scale of Active and\nHealthy\
    \ Ageing IoT based solutions and services, supporting and extending\nthe independent\
    \ living of older adults in their environments, and responding\nto real needs\
    \ of caregivers, service providers and public authorities.\n8.2.1 Introduction\n\
    Throughout Europe and all around the world, mortality rates have fallen\nsigniﬁcantly\
    \ over the past decades [1] leading to considerable changes in the\nage distribution\
    \ of societies [2, 3]. In this context, people aged 60 are now\nexpected to survive\
    \ an additional 18.5 to 21.6 years and soon the world will\nhave a higher number\
    \ of older adults than children. This transformation is\nexpected to continue,\
    \ with the age group of elders (65+) growing from 18%\nto 28% of the EU population\
    \ by the year 2060. Furthermore, according to\nthe 2015 Ageing Report [4], one\
    \ in three Europeans will be over 65 with a\nratio of “working” to “inactive”\
    \ population of 2 to 1, this representing a heavy\nimpact on health and social\
    \ care systems. Indeed, population ageing creates\na common challenge for European\
    \ countries as they must ﬁnd ways to do\nmore with less. Citizen empowerment and\
    \ incitation to self-equip is one of\nthe explored options.\n8.2 ACTIVAGE – Activating\
    \ Innovative IoT Smart Living Environments\n225\nFigure 8.2\nACTIVAGE Deployment\
    \ Sites in 7 EU countries.\nAll of the aforementioned ﬁndings, highlighted the\
    \ Active ageing and\nindependent living activities (such as the EIP Action Group\
    \ C2 – action plan)\nas the ﬁnal goals for EU initiatives related to older adults\
    \ [5].\nThus, legislation, technology, and reimbursement charges, enforce the\n\
    health and social care systems to improve the way they are providing ser-\nvices\
    \ to the European citizens. The “Active and Healthy Ageing” (AHA)\ncommunity is\
    \ wide and heterogeneous in terms of needs, demands and\nliving environments [6].\
    \ AHA services based on the Internet-of-Things are\npromising to be a strategic\
    \ component to support the creation of ecosystem\nable to dynamically answer and\
    \ prevent the challenges faced by the health\nand social care systems [7] (H&SCS):\
    \ the “always-connected” paradigm is\nbecoming a way of life, and this could result\
    \ in a positive transformation for\nH&SCS who are looking for new ways to reorient\
    \ the provision of care and\nkeep older people active and independent for longer.\n\
    226\nIoT European Large-Scale Pilots – Integration, Experimentation and Testing\n\
    8.2.2 Project Description\n8.2.2.1 Main concepts in ACTIVAGE\nACTIVAGE is designed\
    \ as ONE multi-centric Large-Scale Pilot across\nEurope. ACTIVAGE brings UNITY\
    \ of objectives, evaluation methodologies,\nco-operation to achieve critical mass,\
    \ and a single European platform to\ncreate and share evidence. Deployment Sites\
    \ (DS) join clusters of stake-\nholders in the Active and Healthy Living value\
    \ network, working together\nwithin a geographical space (a city or a region).\
    \ These clusters or AHA-\nBusiness Ecosystems are mainly composed by a cohort\
    \ of users (older\nadults, formal and informal caregivers), service providers;\
    \ health care/social\ncare administration; technological infrastructures and technology\
    \ providers\n(infrastructure, sensors, applications, etc.).\nDSs will deploy Reference\
    \ Use Cases (UC) (see Figure 8.3) that address\nspeciﬁc end-user needs, to improve\
    \ their quality of life and autonomy. A\nsingle common interoperable ACTIVAGE\
    \ IoT Ecosystem Suite (AIOTES)\nwill be built up that provides every DS with the\
    \ capacity to develop stan-\ndard and interoperable IoT ecosystems on top of legacy\
    \ IoT platforms, or\ncommunication and data management infrastructures. GLOCAL\
    \ Evaluation\nFramework (Local KPIs and global KPIs) will be designed and implemented\n\
    to demonstrate and evaluate health & social outcomes and socio-economic\nFigure\
    \ 8.3\nACTIVAGE uses cases distribution.\n8.2 ACTIVAGE – Activating Innovative\
    \ IoT Smart Living Environments\n227\nimpact from local up to a European scale,\
    \ enabling effective exchange of\nexperiences and cooperation among peers (e.g.\
    \ users, providers, policy mak-\ners). 9 DS rolled out in 7 countries to constitute\
    \ a major breakthrough to\nsustain open innovation in AHA ﬁeld.\n8.2.2.2 Targeted\
    \ users and user needs\nWithin ACTIVAGE, “Ageing Well with IoT” is considered\
    \ as the goal\nto extend healthy living years of older adults living independently\
    \ and\nautonomously in their preferred environments by the massive adoption of\
    \ IoT\nsolutions. One of the most accepted measurement scales in different studies\n\
    in Europe and World Wide is the Clinical Frailty Scale [8]: ACTIVAGE will\nconcentrate\
    \ on IoT solutions for older people classiﬁed under categories 1\nto 5: “Very\
    \ ﬁt”, “Well, Managing well”, “Vulnerable” and “Mildly frail”.\nACTIVAGE will\
    \ focus on deploying IoT solutions that work towards keeping\nolder people away\
    \ from category 6 and beyond, which already represents\na signiﬁcant cost in care\
    \ for informal carers and for the formal healthcare\nsystems.\nACTIVAGE focusses\
    \ on “domains of needs” for the support of the older\npopulation and in order\
    \ to create a demand-driven experience on the basis of\nFigure 8.4\nMapping of\
    \ needs and use cases.\n228\nIoT European Large-Scale Pilots – Integration, Experimentation\
    \ and Testing\nthe reference Ageing Well initiatives around the world. Figure\
    \ 8.4 shows the\ndomains of needs (on circles) and the Use Cases (UC) that will\
    \ be deployed\nin the 9 DS involving up to 7,000 users.\n8.2.3 The ACTIVAGE Model\
    \ of IoT Ecosystem for Active\nand Healthy Ageing\nACTIVAGE is committed to build\
    \ the ﬁrst European AHA-IoT Ecosystem\nwhich is modelled as a technological infrastructure\
    \ of hardware-software-\nservices and standard protocols i.e. the “ACTIVAGE AIOTES”,\
    \ and a con-\nstellation of stakeholders interacting with each other within a\
    \ governance\nframework towards the achievement of common goals.\nFigure 8.5 shows\
    \ this conceptual scheme. Data is the core asset of the\necosystem. Private Data\
    \ is produced by wearable and medical devices and\nsmart sensors and devices in\
    \ their living environments (e.g. home, car, public\nspaces, etc.). Public data\
    \ might come from different sources, not necessary\nlinked to user interactions\
    \ (e.g. weather, public services time tables, etc.).\nPersonal/private data might\
    \ be processed at the edge and at cloud level. If\nappropiate, interoperability\
    \ interfaces are provided, enabling the delivery of\na huge amount of data to\
    \ be channeled across the pipeline and eventually\nfeed hundreds or thousands\
    \ of services for senior people, providers and\npayors.\nThe realization of this\
    \ model is accomplished in ACIVAGE by the\nAIOTES: this is comprised of two layers\
    \ that form all the necessary\nFigure 8.5\nModel of AHA-IoT ecosystem.\n8.2 ACTIVAGE\
    \ – Activating Innovative IoT Smart Living Environments\n229\ncomponents for:\
    \ a) the support of a universal interoperability framework for\nthe integration\
    \ of the widest possible spectrum of platforms in the area of\nActive and Health\
    \ Living and b) the formation of the diverse application\nmarketplace and a set\
    \ of application tools for the support of creators in\nthe development and deployment\
    \ phases of new applications. Figure 8.6\nsummarizes the envisioned architecture.\
    \ The ﬁnal architecture will be in\ncompliance with standardisation projects such\
    \ as IoT-A. The ACTIVAGE\nsystem will be separated into two distinct layers.\n\
    The IoT Interoperability Layer is aiming to efﬁciently and effectively\nintegrate\
    \ a wide spectrum of open and commercial platforms and IoT devices,\nhaving as\
    \ a starting point the platforms provided for the ACTIVAGE and the\nIoT devices\
    \ used in the Deployment Sites as shown in Figure 8.6. This layer\nwill be further\
    \ separated into two frameworks that will create standardized\ninterfaces for\
    \ a) the sharing of data with sensors and devices and b) the\ninteroperability\
    \ of their offered services. The Services Layer will include\na number of functionalities\
    \ to support efﬁcient integration and effective\ndeployment of new services to\
    \ the envisioned ecosystem: the Applications\nSupport Tools and the Marketplace.\n\
    8.2.4 Expected Project Impacts\nThe ACTIVAGE project has established a set of\
    \ strategic impacts aligned\nwith the vision of the project and designed to drive\
    \ the activities across the\nproject:\n• Societal impact: ACTIVAGE may create\
    \ evidence that support how\nAHA services based on IoT improve the quality of\
    \ life of older adults,\nsupporting the long-term sustainability and efﬁciency\
    \ of health and\nsocial care systems. Aligned with this impact, ACTIVAGE may give\n\
    answer to users’ empowerment with the control of their data, safety\nand wellness,\
    \ promoting healthy and active ageing, while enhancing\nthe competitiveness of\
    \ EU industry through new business models and\nexpansion in new markets.\n• Innovation\
    \ impact: ACTIVAGE may ignite the economic growth by\ninﬂuencing the strategic\
    \ decisions of the different stakeholders, offering\na value based proposal built\
    \ by the co-creation of the different stake-\nholders’ views and interest. Only\
    \ a valuable proposal with an integral\nmulti-stakeholders commitment will assure\
    \ the following key aspects:\na) public and private investment by health and social\
    \ care makers,\n230\nIoT European Large-Scale Pilots – Integration, Experimentation\
    \ and Testing\nFigure 8.6\nConceptual architecture of AIOTES.\n8.3 IoF2020 – Internet\
    \ of Food and Farm 2020\n231\nb) service providers adoption of cost-effective\
    \ business models, c) senior\ncitizens involvement in the creation and adoption\
    \ of AHA services,\nd) to foster industrial innovation on IoT, wearables and sensor\
    \ tech-\nnologies and support standards for interoperability, and e) creation\
    \ of\nnew reliable and useful AHA solutions and services by SMEs and\nentrepreneurs.\n\
    • Economic impact: ACTIVAGE project may analyse the potential sav-\ning and contributions\
    \ to the sustainability of the health care and social\nsystems, and the readiness\
    \ and maturity of the IoT technologies and\necosystem to host local solutions\
    \ and to import and replicate solutions\nfrom other providers/location focused\
    \ on value-based criteria.\n8.2.5 Summary\nDuring its 42 months duration the project\
    \ will be aligned along a single\nﬁve phase innovation path. After evaluating\
    \ and demonstrating evidence\nand value to stakeholders in local Use Cases (UC),\
    \ DSs will cooperate bi-\nlaterally or tri-laterally, allowing coherent, complementary\
    \ replication of UC,\nto generate evidence on the value of interoperability and\
    \ standardisation at a\nEuropean scale. In the last phase, DSs will open to European\
    \ external actors\nto incubate new UCs, technologies, solutions and Business Cases.\
    \ Open calls\nwill attract entrepreneurs and start-ups to implement innovative\
    \ solutions\nusing the mature DS’s IoT ecosystem for testing, demonstration and\
    \ initial\nmarket take-up.\n8.3 IoF2020 – Internet of Food and Farm 2020\nThe\
    \ Internet of Things (IoT) is expected to be a real game changer that will\ndrastically\
    \ improve productivity and sustainability in food and farming. How-\never, current\
    \ IoT applications in this domain are still fragmentary and mainly\nused by a\
    \ small group of early adopters. The Internet of Food and Farm 2020\nLarge-Scale\
    \ Pilot (IoF2020) addresses the organizational and technological\nchallenges to\
    \ overcome this situation by fostering a large-scale uptake of\nIoT in the European\
    \ food and farming domain. The heart of the project is\nformed by a balanced set\
    \ of multi-actor trials that reﬂect the diversity of\nthe food and farming domain.\
    \ Each trial is composed of well-delineated\nuse cases developing IoT solutions\
    \ for the most relevant challenges of the\nconcerned subsector. The project conducts\
    \ 5 trials with a total of 19 use cases\nin arable, dairy, fruits, vegetables\
    \ and meat production. IoF2020 embraces a\n232\nIoT European Large-Scale Pilots\
    \ – Integration, Experimentation and Testing\nlean multi-actor approach that combines\
    \ the development of Minimal Viable\nProducts (MVPs) in short iterations with\
    \ the active involvement of various\nstakeholders. The architectural approach\
    \ supports interoperability of multiple\nuse case systems and reuse of IoT components\
    \ across them. Use cases are\nalso supported in developing business and solving\
    \ governance issues. The\nIoF2020 ecosystem and collaboration space is established\
    \ to boost the uptake\nof IoT in Food and Farming and pave the way for new innovations.\n\
    8.3.1 Introduction\nIoT is a powerful driver that is expected to transform the\
    \ entire farming and\nfood domain into smart webs of connected objects that are\
    \ context-sensitive\nand can be identiﬁed, sensed and controlled remotely [9–11].\
    \ IoT will be a\nreal game changer in agriculture that drastically improves productivity\
    \ and\nsustainability. This vision is illustrated by the story in Figure 8.7,\
    \ which is an\nMarch 2020, a field somewhere in Europe \nThe morning mist soaks\
    \ into thick shreds across the country, above the sun rises and turns the horizon\
    \ red. From \nthe fog a soft humming sound, two tractors emerge. When he spots\
    \ me, the driver of the second tractor steps out, \nbut where is the driver of\
    \ the first tractor? There is none, says the farmer, I operate both machines.\
    \ How? Well, that \nstrange vehicle you saw here last week has mapped the whole\
    \ field and this map is now instructing the board \ncomputers of the two tractors\
    \ how to drive. The first tractor exactly follows pre-programmed lines and carries\
    \ out \nsoil cultivation, based on soil composition. My tractor with a sowing\
    \ machine automatically follows the same lines \nand automatically adjusts distance,\
    \ quantity and variety of potato seed. Incredible, isn’t it? \nTwo weeks later…\
    \ \nThe same field. An unmanned small tractor drives with a high speed along the\
    \ same invisible straight lines. With \nsurgical precision, a hoe eliminates every\
    \ weed in the field, the farmer says. This saves a lot of chemicals and \nlabour\
    \ in comparison to earlier days where we had to spray the full field with a heavy\
    \ tractor. So this is good for \nthe environment and I have much less costs! Within\
    \ a few weeks the fertilizer will follow the same lines again and \nby a pre-defined\
    \ task map it knows exactly where and what to put different types of fertilizer\
    \ for optimal growth of \nthe plants. That map was generated on the basis of big\
    \ data analysis and calculations in the cloud involving \nrelevant data from the\
    \ market, weather and public regulations. Additional cameras are checking the\
    \ crop and, if \nnecessary, make corrections. Again, the plants just get enough\
    \ nutrients to grow optimally and nothing is spoiled to \nthe environment. Wow,\
    \ amazing! Come, I’ll show you how it works in the office. Don’t you have to stay\
    \ with your \ntractor? Oh no, it knows what it is doing. \nAt the office with\
    \ a good old-fashioned cup of coffee… \nOf course we farmers are still in charge\
    \ of our own farm but most of the field operations are carried out \nautomatically\
    \ by autonomous objects. Now we can focus on the market choices and take care\
    \ of communication \nwith our customers and last but not least citizens who are\
    \ very much involved in farming nowadays. After \nexecution of the field work,\
    \ the measured data is automatically returned from the machine to the office through\
    \ the \ncloud. This is the basis for subsequent tasks. But I also provide it to\
    \ research institutes, which feed these data into \ncomputer models for further\
    \ improvement. The same holds for public legislation and certification bodies.\
    \ They use \nthe same data to check for compliance to their rules. Every organisation\
    \ has access to a specific set of our data in \nthe cloud. Of course, this is\
    \ subject to strict security and privacy rules. No, no, I don’t want leave my\
    \ data lying \naround. Oh yes, by the way, food safety and traceability is not\
    \ an issue anymore; it is highly guaranteed by all kind \nof sensors and in case\
    \ something might go wrong early warning systems alert me in time. \nFigure 8.7\n\
    Illustrative story of the vision on IoT in agriculture.\n8.3 IoF2020 – Internet\
    \ of Food and Farm 2020\n233\nexample for arable farming, but it is exemplary\
    \ for other subsectors such as\ndairy, meat, vegetables, and fruits including\
    \ wine and olives.\nTo make this vision come true much technology is already available,\n\
    although there are speciﬁc IoT challenges in this sector. Agri-Food ‘things’\n\
    are often living objects and attached devices have to work in harsh envi-\nronments,\
    \ while network connectivity in rural areas can be challenging. In\nfact, a large-scale\
    \ uptake of IoT in agriculture is in particular prevented by\na lack of interoperability,\
    \ user concerns about data ownership, privacy and\nsecurity, and by appropriate\
    \ business models that are also suitable for (very)\nsmall companies [12, 13].\
    \ Consequently, current IoT applications in farming\nand food are still fragmentary\
    \ and mainly used by a small group of early\nadopters, despite the great world-wide\
    \ interest of IoT technology providers\nand investors.\nIoF2020 is a European\
    \ Large-Scale Pilot (LSP) on IoT for Smart Farming\nand Food Security. Its main\
    \ objective is to foster a large-scale uptake of IoT\nin the European farming\
    \ and food domain. This will contribute to a next huge\ninnovation boost and consequently\
    \ to a drastically improved productivity and\nsustainability in the agri-food\
    \ domain. More speciﬁcally, IoF2020 aims to:\n• Demonstrate the business case\
    \ of IoT for a large number of application\nareas in farming and food;\n• Integrate\
    \ and reuse available IoT technologies by exploiting open\narchitectures and standards;\n\
    • Ensure user acceptability of IoT solutions in farming and food by\naddressing\
    \ user needs, including security, privacy and trust;\n• Ensure the sustainability\
    \ of IoT solutions beyond the project by vali-\ndating the related business models\
    \ and setting up an IoT Ecosystem for\nlarge scale uptake.\nThe IoF2020 consortium\
    \ consists of 71 public and private partners from 16\ndifferent countries and\
    \ has a total budget of 35 Me. The project started in\nJanuary 2017 and will last\
    \ for 4 years.\n8.3.2 Trials and Use cases\nThe heart of the project is formed\
    \ by a balanced set of multi-actor trials\nthat reﬂect the diversity of the food\
    \ and farming domain, including different\nagricultural sub sectors, conventional\
    \ and organic farming, early adopters and\nearly majority farmers, SMEs and large\
    \ industrial companies, and different\n234\nIoT European Large-Scale Pilots –\
    \ Integration, Experimentation and Testing\nsupply chain roles including logistics\
    \ and consumption. Each trial is com-\nposed of well-delineated use cases that\
    \ together address the most relevant\nchallenges for the concerned subsector.\
    \ The use cases follow a demand-driven\nphilosophy in which IoT solutions for\
    \ speciﬁc business needs are developed\nby a dedicated team of agri-food end users\
    \ and IoT companies (integra-\ntors, app/service developers, infrastructure/technology\
    \ providers) with a clear\ncommercial drive, supported by R&D organisations. IoF2020\
    \ conducts 5\ntrials with a total of 19 use cases in arable, dairy, fruits, vegetables\
    \ and meat\nproduction (Figure 8.8).\nThe Internet of Arable Farming (trial 1)\
    \ integrates operations\nacross the entire arable cropping cycle combining IoT\
    \ technolo-\ngies, data acquisition (soil, crop, climate) in growing and storage\n\
    of arable crops (potatoes, wheat and soya beans). These will be\nlinked to existing\
    \ sensor networks, earth observation systems, crop\ngrowth models and yield gap\
    \ analysis tools and external databases (e.g. eco-\nnomic/environmental impact)\
    \ and translated into farm management systems.\nThe trial will result in increasing\
    \ yields, less environmental impact, easier\ncross-compliance and product traceability\
    \ and more use of technology by\nfarmers. The trial consists of 4 use cases:\n\
    1.1 Within-ﬁeld management zoning: deﬁning speciﬁc ﬁeld management\nzones by developing\
    \ and linking sensing- and actuating devices with\nexternal data;\nFigure 8.8\n\
    Geographical coverage of the IoF2020 trials and use cases.\n8.3 IoF2020 – Internet\
    \ of Food and Farm 2020\n235\n1.2 Precision Crop Management: smart wheat crop\
    \ management by sensors\ndata embedded in a low-power, long-range network infrastructure;\n\
    1.3 Soya Protein Management: improving protein production by combining\nsensor\
    \ data and translate them into effective machine task operations;\n1.4 Farm Machine\
    \ Interoperability: data exchange between ﬁeld machinery\nand farm management\
    \ information systems for supporting cross-over\npilot machine communication.\n\
    The Internet of Dairy Farming (trial 2) implements, experi-\nences and demonstrates\

    The Internet of Fruits (trial 3) demonstrates IoT technology\nthat is integrated\
    \ throughout the whole supply chain from the\nﬁeld, logistics, processing to the\
    \ retailer. Sensors in orchards and\nvineyards (incl. weather stations, multispectral/thermal\
    \ cameras)\nwill be connected through the cloud and used for monitoring,\nearly\
    \ warning of pests and diseases and control (e.g. variable rate spraying,\nselective\
    \ harvesting). Traceability devices (incl. RFID, multidimensional bar-\ncodes)\
    \ and smart packaging allows for condition monitoring during storage,\nprocessing,\
    \ transportation and on the shelves. Big data analyses will further\noptimize\
    \ all processes in the whole chain. This will result in reduced pre-\nand post-harvest\
    \ losses, less inputs, higher (fresh) quality and better traceable\nproducts (incl.\
    \ protected designation of origin, PDO). The trial consists of 4\ncoherent use\
    \ cases:\n236\nIoT European Large-Scale Pilots – Integration, Experimentation\

    \ full-controlled indoor growing with\nan artiﬁcial lighting system, semi-controlled\
    \ greenhouse produc-\ntion and non-regulated ambient conditions in open-air cultivation\n\
    of vegetables. It demonstrates the automatic execution of growth\nrecipes by the\
    \ intelligent combination of sensors that measure crop conditions\nand control\
    \ processes (incl. lighting, climate, irrigation and logistics) and\nanalysis\
    \ of big data that is collected through these sensors and advanced\nvisioning\
    \ systems with location speciﬁcation. This will result in improved\nproduction\
    \ control and better communication throughout the supply chain\n(incl. harvest\

    \ level) can be optimized and commu-\nnication throughout the whole supply chain\
    \ can be improved based\non automated monitoring and control of advanced sensor-actuator\n\
    systems. The data generated by events will also be used for early\nwarning (e.g.\

    \ This will assure meat quality,\nreduce mortality, optimize labour and improve\
    \ animal health and welfare\nleading to reduction of antibiotics. The trial consists\
    \ of 3 use cases:\n5.1 Pig farm management: optimise pig production management\
    \ by interop-\nerable on-farm sensors and slaughter house data;\n5.2 Poultry chain\
    \ management: optimize production, transport and process-\ning of poultry meat\

    \ and Traceability: enhancing transparency and trace-\nability of meat based on\
    \ an monitored chain event data in an EPCIS-\ninfrastructure.\n8.3.3 Technical\
    \ Architectural Approach\nEach use case will be an autonomous implementation of\
    \ an IoT system, which\nprovides a dedicated solution for a speciﬁc domain challenge.\
    \ However, for\na large scale uptake it is important to maximize synergies across\
    \ multiple\nuse case systems. Therefore, a core concept of IoF2020 is that the\
    \ use\ncase systems function as nodes in a software ecosystem [14]. As a conse-\n\
    quence, much attention is paid to ensuring the interoperability of multiple\n\
    use case systems and the reuse of IoT components across them. Figure 8.9\nshows\
    \ the architectural approach to achieve this during design, development,\nimplementation\
    \ and deployment.\nFigure 8.9\nThe IoF2020 architectural process to ensure reuse\
    \ and interoperability of use\ncase IoT systems.\n238\nIoT European Large-Scale\
    \ Pilots – Integration, Experimentation and Testing\nThe use case architectures\
    \ will be based on a common technical reference\narchitecture to create a shared\
    \ understanding and to maximize synergies\nacross multiple use case systems. Each\
    \ use case within a trial will design\na speciﬁc instance of the reference architecture\
    \ to address its speciﬁc user\nrequirements. The project will provide a catalogue\
    \ of reusable system com-\nponents, which can be integrated in the IoT systems\
    \ of multiple use cases\nto facilitate large-scale uptake. This repository goes\
    \ beyond a checklist and\nincludes practical guidelines and implementation tools.\
    \ The IoF2020 lab\nwill support the implementation of reusable IoT components\
    \ in a testbed\nenvironment. Finally, IoF2020 will provide a Collaboration Space\
    \ in which\nservices and data can be shared as a key enabler to facilitate the\
    \ interaction\nbetween the IoT systems of the use cases during deployment. As\
    \ indicated,\nthe project will reuse components and knowledge from previous projects\
    \ and\nexisting organizations and try to embed and sustain the project results\
    \ into the\nsame organizations.\n8.3.4 Lean Multi-Actor Approach\nIoF2020 embraces\
    \ a demand-driven methodology in which end-users from\nthe agri-food are actively\
    \ involved during the entire development process\naiming at cross-fertilisation,\
    \ co-creation and co-ownership of results (see\nFigure 8.10).\nThe approach for\
    \ the use cases is a combination of the lean start-up\nmethodology that focuses\
    \ on the development of Minimal Viable Products\nFigure 8.10\nIoF2020 Project\
    \ approach and structure.\n8.4 MONICA – Management of Networked IoT Wearables\
    \ – Very Large Scale\n239\n(MVPs) in short iterations and the multi-actor approach\
    \ that stresses the\nactive involvement of various stakeholders. The use cases\
    \ will actively be\nsupported by three other work packages (WPs). WP3 facilitates\
    \ sharing,\nreuse and ﬁnally integration of IoT components as described in the\
    \ previous\nsection. WP4 provides business support in terms of monitoring KPIs,\
    \ business\nmodels, market studies and governance aspects (incl. security, data\
    \ owner-\nship, privacy, liability and ethical issues). WP5 facilitates the development\n\
    and expansion of the various ecosystems on use case and project level\nand beyond\
    \ amongst others by communication, dissemination, organizing\nworkshops and events\
    \ and by active involvement of European and national\ncommunities from the demand-\
    \ and supply-side of IoT, including industry\nassociations and cooperatives, European\
    \ Innovation Partnerships, Technol-\nogy Platforms and ERAnets. A mid-term open\
    \ call of 6 Me will be used\nto further accelerate these developments. This approach\
    \ establishes a large\nIoF2020 ecosystem and collaboration space that is expected\
    \ to sustain after\nthe project.\n8.3.5 Conclusion and Outlook\nIoF2020 aims to\
    \ boost the uptake of IoT in European Food and Farming.\nThis will be realized\
    \ through a balanced set of multi-actor trials and use\ncases in several subsectors.\
    \ The use cases are developed in a scalable manner\nthrough an open technical\
    \ architecture and infrastructure with components\nthat can be shared and reused\
    \ by stakeholders outside the project. This devel-\nopment is leveraged by activities\
    \ that build-up and extend the total ecosystem,\ndeﬁning attractive and successful\
    \ business models and solving governance\nissues. In this way IoF2020 will pave\
    \ the way for data-driven farming,\nautonomous operations, virtual food chains\
    \ and personalized nutrition for\nEuropean citizens.\n8.4 MONICA – Management\
    \ of Networked IoT Wearables –\nVery Large Scale Demonstration of Cultural Societal\n\
    Applications\nThe Large-Scale Pilot MONICA demonstrates how cities can use the\
    \ Internet\nof Things to deal with sound, noise and security challenges at big,\
    \ cultural,\nopen-air events. A range of applications will be demonstrated in\
    \ six major\nEuropean cities involving more than 100,000 users in total. The project\
    \ brings\ntogether 29 partners from 9 European countries with the objectives to\
    \ provide\n240\nIoT European Large-Scale Pilots – Integration, Experimentation\

    \ the noise for the neighbours. It will also\nimprove responsiveness to security\
    \ challenges1.\na very large-scale demonstration of multiple existing and new\
    \ Internet of\nThings technologies for Smarter Living.\nImagine sound zones at\
    \ outdoor concerts in the city where the sound\nexperience is enhanced for those\
    \ who enjoy the music and the noise mitigated\nfor those who don’t. Visualise\
    \ intelligent cameras deployed at city festivals\nwhich, while preserving privacy,\
    \ estimate crowd size and density in real time,\nnotifying security staff of any\
    \ unusual crowd behaviour. Or imagine smart\nwristbands and mobile apps, allowing\
    \ people to interact with each other and\nthe performers, informing people of\
    \ the best way out of the venue or guiding\nthem to the nearest exit in case of\
    \ an emergency.\nThese are some of the several applications which MONICA will\
    \ demon-\nstrate at minimum 16 cultural events, taking place all over Europe in\n\
    Copenhagen, Bonn, Hamburg, Leeds, Lyon and Torino. The broad list of\nevents includes\
    \ concerts, festivals, city and sport events and involve the\nuse of multiple,\
    \ wearable, mobile and ﬁxed devices with sensors, such as\n1Photo courtesy of\

    \ smart glasses, video cameras, loudspeakers, drones and mobile\nphones. The full\
    \ list of pilot events is shown in Table 8.1.\n8.4.1 Introduction\nThe deployment\
    \ of Internet of Things has also a major impact on society\nspeciﬁcally in urban\
    \ environments, where it helps to solve major societal\nchallenges. The rapidly\
    \ growing number of Smart City platforms enables\ncities to assemble all their\
    \ digital applications on uniform communication\nnetworks spanning entire cities\
    \ delivering diverse applications such as health,\nenergy and resource efﬁciency,\
    \ and trafﬁc management that help the city to\nbecome more environmentally sustainable\
    \ and citizens to have a better life.\nIn technology areas, standard IoT middleware,\
    \ architecture and technology\nenablers have mitigated the complexity of communication\
    \ and integration and\npaved the way for a wealth of innovative distributed applications\
    \ in many vital\nareas of our society. However, most of the IoT and Smart City\
    \ platforms are\nstill insufﬁciently developed to handle really large scale deployment.\
    \ Health\nand smart living may potentially involve thousands of users, but they\
    \ are\nrelatively scarcely distributed, even within a city, and the communication\
    \ load\nis limited.\nIn response, the MONICA platform will demonstrate a resilient\
    \ IoT\nplatform that addresses major issues of large scale deployments: Scaling,\n\
    costs of sensors, and intelligence. On this background, the MONICA project\n242\n\
    IoT European Large-Scale Pilots – Integration, Experimentation and Testing\nis\
    \ uniquely innovative since it will demonstrate an extremely large uptake\nof\
    \ a multitude of IoT applications (10,000+ simultaneous and more than\n100,000\
    \ different users) using low-costs wearables and apps running on\nexisting wearable\
    \ platforms such as smart watches and smart phones in\ncombination with wearable\
    \ sensors. Moreover, the platform will demonstrate\nheterogeneous interfaces for\
    \ both expensive, professional infrastructure com-\nponents and affordable, wearable,\
    \ and widely used consumer devices. Finally,\nthe demonstration will show closed\
    \ feedback loops to actuating networks\nand human interaction and intervention\
    \ based on situational awareness and\ndecision support.\n8.4.2 The MONICA Ecosystems\n\
    The MONICA IoT Platform will be demonstrated in the scope of three\necosystems:\n\
    8.4.2.1 The Security Ecosystem\nThe MONICA Security Ecosystem will demonstrate\
    \ how a multitude of\ninnovative applications for managing public security and\
    \ safety can be seam-\nlessly integrated with IoT sensors and actuators and used\
    \ in large scale. The\ncore security and safety challenges at large events, such\
    \ as those proposed\nin MONICA, are the handling and mitigation of unforeseen\
    \ incidents and\naccidents: personal violence, panic scenes, severe illness of\
    \ individuals in\nthe middle of a crowd, infrastructure catastrophes such as ﬁre\
    \ or structural\ncollapses. The aim of any security platform is to ensure the\
    \ monitoring,\nrecording, identiﬁcation, analysis of any part of the monitored\
    \ environment,\nand measures capable of predicting and, whenever possible, mitigate\
    \ the\ndanger of potential or imminent events. The modelling of incidents and\n\
    accidents is therefore necessary in order to be able to deal with episodes\nwhile\
    \ or before they unfold. The Security Ecosystem will consist of a series\nof large\
    \ and small applications that, in combination, can be used to monitor\nand manage\
    \ the security situation before, during and after an event. The\nmain objectives\
    \ of the applications are to demonstrate how the IoT platform\nwill seamlessly\
    \ support open and closed loop solutions that address real-\nlife safety challenges.\
    \ The traditional security tools used at an event are\nnormally a variety of perimeter\
    \ security as e.g. fences, supported by CCTV\ncameras, few entrances with guards\
    \ and guards working around the area.\nMONICA will implement additional security\
    \ and safety measures, e.g. by\n8.4 MONICA – Management of Networked IoT Wearables\
    \ – Very Large Scale\n243\ncombining information on the ﬂy for real-time operation\
    \ and to support\nthe work of security staff. MONICA hence will not change the\
    \ already\nexisting security concepts of events, rather it will complement extra\
    \ valuable\nreal-time information supporting the early detection of potentially\
    \ critical\nsituations.\n8.4.2.2 The Acoustics Ecosystem\nThe MONICA Acoustic\
    \ Ecosystem will demonstrate how a multitude of\ninnovative applications for managing\
    \ open air music performances in the\npublic space can be seamlessly integrated\
    \ with sensors and actuators using the\nMONICA platform. It will consist of a\
    \ series of large and small applications\nthat, in combination, can be used to\
    \ monitor and manage the sound before,\nduring and after a performance. The main\
    \ objectives of the applications are to\ndemonstrate how the IoT platform will\
    \ seamlessly support open and closed\nloop solutions that address real-life environmental\
    \ challenges e.g. noise in\npublic spaces. E.g. at inner city open air concerts,\
    \ sound ﬁelds will be\noptimised with respect for both the performers and the\
    \ concert audience in\nterms of loudness, directionality and quality. The sound\
    \ zone system and\nactuation layer of the MONICA platform allows for dynamic adjustment\
    \ of\nthe active sound ﬁeld control loudspeakers, thus, improving the sound quality\n\
    of visitors while at the same time reducing the noise for neighbours. Health\n\
    monitoring of sound level exposure can be offered to concerned concertgoers.\n\
    A cheap, wearable sound level meter in bracelets can be connected to a\nSmartphone\
    \ app and continuously measure the cumulative sound dose. The\nuser can thus seek\
    \ less loud sections of the concert arena.\n8.4.2.3 The Innovation Ecosystem\n\
    Communication to customers, crowds and citizens is improved by the use\nof mobile\
    \ apps and IoT wristbands with value-adding features, enabling\npeople to interact\
    \ with and locate each other, informing visitors of the best\nplace to park, the\
    \ best way out or the bars with the shortest queue, and\nguiding participants\
    \ to the nearest exit in case of an emergency. General\ndata such as on sound\
    \ levels are made accessible as open data on the\nhosting city’s websites for\
    \ citizen engagement and innovation. Applications\nfor user involvement with artists\
    \ at concerts or among citizens based on\ndifferent kinds of wearables will be\
    \ tested. Open APIs will be provided to\nfoster new businesses and start-up solutions\
    \ based on the MONICA IoT\nPlatform.\n244\nIoT European Large-Scale Pilots – Integration,\
    \ Experimentation and Testing\n8.4.3 User-Driven Pilots\nThe MONICA platform and\
    \ its components will be demonstrated in six\ndifferent pilot cities in different\
    \ ﬁve Member States across Europe and as\nclose as possible to real-life operational\
    \ conditions under typical load and\nconstraints associated with organising big\
    \ events. From the pilots, the project\nwill evaluate both qualitative and quantitative\
    \ success measures towards\nestablished KPI’s related to stakeholder satisfaction\
    \ and the improved efﬁ-\nciency in handling of large scale events. In this framework,\
    \ the following\nspeciﬁc activities will take place in the selected pilot sites:\n\
    • Integration, deployment and operation of commercially available ﬁxed\nand mobile\
    \ devices and development of new wearable devices in the\nMONICA IoT and relevant\
    \ Smart City infrastructures.\n• Integration, deployment and operation of commercially\
    \ available ﬁxed\nand mobile actuating devices and the relevant software applications\n\
    mentioned above.\n• Development and deployment of fully automated closed-loop\
    \ systems\nwhich uses sensing inputs from the IoT network layers to assist humans\n\
    in monitoring, situational awareness and decision making and provide\nthe resulting\
    \ control regimes for the actuating IoT infrastructure.\n• Validation of pre-deﬁned\
    \ impact Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)\nrelated to each pilot site along with\
    \ the methodology and the relevant\nassessment procedures in order to obtain and\
    \ disseminate qualitative and\nquantitative date for replication.\n• Demonstration\
    \ of the generic applicability and interoperability of exper-\nimental testbeds\
    \ and open platforms in validation of IoT technologies\nand identiﬁcation of where\
    \ standards are missing and pre-normative\nactivities are needed.\n• Development\
    \ and validation of new markets and business models aiming\nat involving all actors\
    \ in the innovation value chain as well as assessing\nthe impact on Europe’s Cultural\
    \ and Creative Industries.\n• Active involvement of all actors in the validation\
    \ and dissemination in\norder to establish the best possible foundation for creating\
    \ maximum\nimpact and replication potential from the demonstrations.\nIn addition\
    \ to the planned demonstrations, the MONICA deployments\naddresses – in a smaller\
    \ scale – the solutions to more generic Smart City\nchallenges i.e. the deployment\
    \ of a common ICT infrastructure and compo-\nnents in city areas with very diverse\
    \ needs and context, to deliver services\nwith different business and technical\
    \ conﬁgurations. The speciﬁcation for the\n8.4 MONICA – Management of Networked\

    \ Germany’s biggest goose fair. It takes place three\ntimes a year in spring,\
    \ summer and winter and offers its attractions to 7–10 million visitors\nduring\
    \ the 91 DOM days2.\nMONICA pilots will be extracted from comprehensive use cases\
    \ and concrete\nbusiness cases deﬁned by demand-side stakeholders and users. Demand-side\n\
    representatives in the requirements process will be drawn from the ﬁelds of\n\
    concert organisers, artistic performers, spectators, public authorities, citizens,\n\
    civic engagement groups, and other relevant groups found inside and outside\n\
    the consortium. This methodology allows for maximum stakeholder input\ncaptured\
    \ in the analysis of the use cases, the business ecosystem, the value\nchain interactions\
    \ and the general societal and environmental realm.\nThe implementation and deployment\
    \ of the pilot sides will be based in\na mix of commercially available components\
    \ and solutions, open architec-\ntures and design approaches from previous the\
    \ portfolio of technologies and\ntools so far developed and demonstrated in reduced\
    \ and controlled environ-\nments as well as targeted research and development\
    \ of speciﬁc prototype\nsolutions where needed. Pilot work plans will include\
    \ feedback mecha-\nnisms to allow adaptation and optimisation of the technological\
    \ and business\napproach to the particular use case.\n2Photo courtesy of Hamburg.de\n\

    8.4.4 The MONICA Technical Concept\nThe MONICA platform features a cloud based\
    \ on advanced, open IoT\ntechnologies dynamically integrating ﬁxed and nomadic\
    \ devices and truly\nmobile wearables in the physical world with automated closed-loop\
    \ actuat-\ning functions. The platform will also integrate humans in the loop\
    \ where\nappropriate, by providing situational awareness and dynamic decision\
    \ support\ntools. A strong toolbox for security and trust management will complement\n\
    the platform.\nThe platform will be able to support multiple IoT applications\
    \ in a wide\nusage context focusing on the two most important challenges for organisers\n\
    of large scale concerts and cultural events in large cities: Unwanted noise in\n\
    the surroundings and security of the audience.\n8.4.4.1 The MONICA architecture\n\
    The MONICA platform is built on several IoT physical world network\ninfrastructures\
    \ and a closed loop control system for each application. The\ncomponents are connected\
    \ via dedicated communication network and data\nrepositories. The entire solution\
    \ is embedded in a MONICA Private Cloud\nstructure as visualised in Figure 8.13.\n\
    8.4.4.2 The MONICA IoT Infrastructure\nThe MONICA IoT Infrastructure, depicted\
    \ in Figure 8.14, must be capable of\nhandling three different types of IoT devices:\
    \ i) wearable devices, ii) nomadic\ndevices and iii) ﬁxed sensors and ﬁxed Cyber\
    \ Physical Systems.\nWearable devices include wristbands, glasses and mobile phones.\
    \ Wrist-\nbands are intended to be worn by the spectators and staff while glasses\
    \ are\nintended mainly for the security staff. Wristbands have connectivity based\n\
    on either Ultra-Wideband (UWB) or narrow-band radio (868/900 MHz)\ntechnologies.\
    \ Smart glasses instead will be used, based on the Android OS\nand equipped with\
    \ front-facing camera, inertial sensors, light sensor, GPS\nand pressure sensor.\
    \ The glasses have real see-through displays with a WVGA\nresolution and have\
    \ Wi-Fi b/g/n and BT4.0 connectivity. Nomadic devices are\nmobile devices conﬁned\
    \ to the event area, such as hand held sound dosimeters\nand other sensors (e.g.\
    \ sound meter, temperature sensor, wind sensor, camera,\netc.) mounted on controllable\
    \ airships. Fixed sensors and Cyber Physical\nSystems comprise devices mounted\
    \ on ﬁxed structures in and around the\nevent area, e.g. sound pressure gauges\
    \ and dosimeters, microphones, cameras,\nanemometers, etc.\n8.4 MONICA – Management\
    \ of Networked IoT Wearables – Very Large Scale\n247\nFigure 8.13\nThe overall\
    \ MONICA concept.\nFigure 8.14\nMONICA IoT Architecture.\nIn order to manage the\
    \ heterogeneity of a large amount of the above-\nmentioned devices, a proper IoT\
    \ architecture will be deﬁned following the\nAIOTI High-level Architecture (HLA)\
    \ and the AIOTI Domain Model pro-\nposed by the AIOTI WG03 – loT Standardisation.\
    \ The MONICA Distributed\n248\nIoT European Large-Scale Pilots – Integration,\
    \ Experimentation and Testing\nIoT Middleware will implement the IoT infrastructure\
    \ using existing IoT\ngateways and services, e.g. LinkSmart R⃝, FI-WARE, SCRAL,\
    \ and oneM2M.\nDe-facto standards such as MQTT for publish/subscribe and SAREF\
    \ (Smart\nAppliance Reference Ontology, ETSI TS 103 264 standard) and the W3C\n\
    Semantic Sensor Network Ontology for semantic modelling will be applied.\n8.4.5\
    \ Conclusion and Outlook\nThe MONICA project will carry out unique demonstrations\
    \ of large scale take\nup of IoT deployments at highly relevant inner city cultural\
    \ open-air events.\nIt will pave the way for innovative business opportunities\
    \ for technology and\nsoftware providers in the ﬁeld of IoT. Ultimately, the project\
    \ aims to improve\nthe quality of life in our cities for all citizens.\n8.5 SynchroniCity:\
    \ Delivering a Digital Single Market for\nIoT-enabled Urban Services in Europe\
    \ and Beyond\nSmart cities hold the potential to be a key driver and catalyst\
    \ in creating a\nlarge scale global IoT market of services and hardware. However,\
    \ the emerg-\ning smart city market faces speciﬁc challenges that act as barriers\
    \ to growth,\nimpeding rapid innovation and inhibiting widespread market adoption.\n\
    SynchroniCity is an ambitious initiative to deliver a digital single market\n\
    for Europe and beyond for IoT-enabled urban services by piloting its\nfoundations\
    \ at scale in reference zones across eight European cities and\ninvolving other\
    \ cities globally. It addresses how to incentivize and build\ntrust for companies\
    \ and citizens to actively participate and ﬁnd common\nco-created IoT solutions\
    \ for cities that meet citizen needs, and to create\nan environment of evidence-based\
    \ solutions that can easily be replicated in\nother regions. These reference zones\
    \ are based on cities at the forefront of\nsmart city development covering different\

    \ an opportunity to profoundly change how our\nexisting society works. They can\
    \ enable a transformation of different industry\n8.5 SynchroniCity: Delivering\
    \ a Digital Single Market\n249\nFigure 8.15\nSynchroniCity cities and regions.\n\
    sectors improving existing business activities, processes, and competencies\n\
    within organizations and across their boundaries.\nData infrastructures and the\
    \ Internet of Things (IoT) form a critical part\nof the digital transformation\
    \ of cities and communities by creating adequate\nawareness of real-world processes\
    \ in order to drive more efﬁcient, partially\nautonomous, decision making, while\
    \ still maintaining a high level of data pro-\ntection, inclusivity and general\
    \ support for local priorities such as economic\ndevelopment and cultural heritage.\n\
    In terms of data infrastructures, cities have been at the forefront of\nembracing\
    \ the open data movement. The release of data sets to the public\nhas increased\
    \ transparency and provided early innovation potential for third\nparty stakeholders.\
    \ Services such as Citymapper3 show how open data can\nadd great beneﬁts to the\
    \ journey experiences of citizens.\nMany cities have invested in the setup of\
    \ open data portals and pro-\nactively encourage stakeholders across public departments\
    \ and the private\nsector to contribute data sets. At the same time, cities are\
    \ trying to engage\nentrepreneurs and communities to innovate around these data\
    \ stores. Early\nresults are promising, but static or sporadically changing data\
    \ sets have their\nlimitations.\n3https://citymapper.com/\n250\nIoT European Large-Scale\
    \ Pilots – Integration, Experimentation and Testing\nFigure 8.16\nStreet light\
    \ in Santander.\nIoT infrastructures are increasingly becoming an important element\
    \ in\nproviding the underpinning digital layer of smart city services. They augment\n\
    the open data sets with rich real-time information about public infrastructure\n\
    conditions and city processes that can be exploited for a more responsive\ndelivery\
    \ of public services. Examples range from an improved mobility expe-\nrience through\
    \ adaptive trafﬁc management and multi-modal transportation to\nresource savings\
    \ achieved by smart street light control, waste collection and\nirrigation management.\n\
    Various demonstrations of such systems are emerging globally showing\nthe beneﬁts\
    \ of data-driven services based on IoT and data infrastructures.\nHowever, many\
    \ of these systems currently operate in silos both in terms\nof the technology\
    \ employed and the operating environments of the city.\nInteroperability issues\
    \ and lack of economies of scale make many potential\nbusiness cases still hard\
    \ to justify and result in a lack of conﬁdence in the\nmarket.\nSynchroniCity\
    \ aims to overcome the existing barriers in the market by\nfostering the emergence\
    \ of a digital single market for smart city services. It\n8.5 SynchroniCity: Delivering\
    \ a Digital Single Market\n251\nbrings eight European cities together to work\
    \ on a common blueprint for IoT\nand data infrastructures with standardized interfaces\
    \ and information models,\ncreating an environment that allows vendors and solution\
    \ providers to more\nopenly compete.\nOur vision is to move from disparate data\
    \ stores and city platforms\nto vibrant marketplaces for urban data and services\
    \ providing adequate\nincentives for a variety of stakeholders to participate.\
    \ For providers of IoT\ninfrastructure and other urban data sources, this should\
    \ provide a trusted\nenvironment to generate reliable revenue ﬂows. For application\
    \ and service\ndevelopers, it should allow frictionless access to reliable and\
    \ trusted urban\ndata streams to be used as assets underpinning the innovation\
    \ no matter\nwhat city is involved. We call this aspect “avoiding city lock-in”.\
    \ Cities\nand infrastructure providers can beneﬁt from an aligned environment\
    \ with\nstandardised interfaces to access a diverse pool of vendor solutions able\n\
    to compete fairly on price and performance. We call this aspect “avoiding\nvendor\
    \ lock-in”. Together, they form the robust underpinnings of a global\nmarket for\
    \ IoT-enabled urban services.\n8.5.2 Technical and Non-Technical Barriers of Creating\
    \ a Smart\nCity Eco-System\nSynchroniCity addresses a wide range of technological\
    \ and non-technological\nbarriers that need to be overcome to enable necessary\
    \ economies of scale and\nmarket conﬁdence to emerge.\nThe key technological barriers\
    \ include:\n• Lack of standardized multi-vendor ecosystem, leading to fear of\
    \ vendor\nlock-in for many cities;\n• Lack of common service provisioning environments\
    \ across cities, lead-\ning to fear of city lock-in for service developers as\
    \ they need to\n“redevelop” major parts of their apps and renegotiate access to\
    \ different\ndata sources for every city;\n• Close coupling of IoT infrastructure\
    \ and applications, leading to IoT\nsolution silos and limited infrastructure\
    \ reuse;\n• Lack of tools, license models and platforms to facilitate the incentivized\n\
    sharing of urban IoT data and other relevant data sets;\n• Lack of harmonized\
    \ business practice and legal frameworks across\ncities – making IoT infrastructure\
    \ roll out and launch of new services\ntedious across different geographies;\n\
    252\nIoT European Large-Scale Pilots – Integration, Experimentation and Testing\n\
    • Lack of understanding of privacy and personal data protection implica-\ntions\
    \ – making it difﬁcult to fully leverage data of citizens collected in\npublic\
    \ spaces in responsible way; and\n• Lack of conﬁdence in adopting emerging technologies\
    \ due to increasing\ntechnology ﬂuidity – rapid change and emergence of new standards\n\
    make it hard for cities to understand where sustainable investments can\nbe made.\n\
    Besides technological challenges, cities offer unique constraints and non-\ntechnological\
    \ barriers, which hamper the adoption of IoT technologies. They\ninclude:\n• Economical\
    \ costs and budget constraints make it difﬁcult to for cities to\nmake major investments\
    \ in newly emerging technologies;\n• Inﬂexible public tender processes and procurement\
    \ models complicate\nexperimental exploration with new technology solutions;\n\
    • Frequent political changes and reliance on election cycles leads often to\n\
    reprioritisation and lack of continuity to focus on longer term innovation\nprogrammes;\n\
    • Lack of a holistic smart city strategy leads to investments in fragmented\n\
    systems for different verticals, making it difﬁcult to capitalise across\nthese\
    \ and gain cost savings; and\n• Lack of involvement of citizens and support from\
    \ these can lead to smart\ncity solutions not addressing real citizen needs and\
    \ fuel the mistrust of\ncitizen in adopting new technology solutions.\n8.5.3 SynchroniCity\
    \ Technical Approach\nOvercoming the barriers identiﬁed above requires a common\
    \ approach\nacross the different reference zones. In the following we introduce\
    \ the key\nfoundations for our vision of the SynchroniCity digital single market.\n\
    Technical barriers 1–3 and in part 7 demand a common reference archi-\ntecture\
    \ for smart city platforms. A standardised reference architecture, which\nis widely\
    \ adopted among many cities with clearly deﬁned components and\ninterfaces is\
    \ fundamental to overcome vendor lock-in. It will boost market\nconﬁdence and\
    \ lay down the foundations for the required economies of scale.\nKey elements\
    \ in this reference architecture are common north- and south-\nbound interfaces.\
    \ Technical barrier 4 demands new market place enablers\nthat encourage sharing\
    \ of urban IoT data and other relevant data sets among\n8.5 SynchroniCity: Delivering\
    \ a Digital Single Market\n253\nFigure 8.17\nHigh level architectural view of\
    \ the SynchroniCity single digital market.\ndifferent stakeholders. Lastly, barriers\
    \ 5–6 relate to ﬁnding agreement on\ncommon principles of governance of a digital\
    \ single market.\nFigure 8.17 shows an overview of the proposed components of\
    \ the Syn-\nchroniCity single market place including common north- and southbound\n\
    interfaces. A further important feature is the market place enablers that\nunderpin\
    \ a thriving business eco-system around IoT data streams, actuation\ncapabilities\
    \ and other urban data sources. In the following we brieﬂy describe\neach of these.\n\
    A common reference architecture for smart city platforms. A standard-\nized reference\
    \ architecture, which is widely adopted among cities with clearly\ndeﬁned components\
    \ and interfaces, is fundamental to overcome vendor lock-\nin. It will boost market\
    \ conﬁdence and lay down the foundations for the\nrequired economies of scale.\n\
    Common northbound interfaces. Developers require a common, homoge-\nneous and\
    \ IoT independent way to access data from the devices infrastructure,\nbut also\
    \ from any other subsystem in the city that can provide valuable\ninformation\
    \ to develop smart services and applications. More speciﬁcally, this\nincludes\
    \ 1) a common standard API for context information management;\n2) a common set\
    \ of information models enabling actual interoperability of\napplications; and\
    \ 3) a set of common standards data publication platforms\n254\nIoT European Large-Scale\
    \ Pilots – Integration, Experimentation and Testing\nhave to comply with, enabling\
    \ the harvesting of data coming from multiple\nfederated platforms as well as\
    \ the publication of real-time open data.\nCommon southbound interfaces. For IoT\
    \ device vendors and manufacturers\nit should become easier to offer suitable\
    \ device stacks for integrating hetero-\ngeneous IoT components into a common\
    \ environment, together with a market\nplace for compliant IoT products and solutions.\n\
    Market place enablers. These should encourage sharing of urban IoT data\nand other\
    \ relevant data sets among different stakeholders. By providing a mar-\nket place\
    \ as a one-stop-shop, it will become much easier for data consumers\nto discover\
    \ and access urban data sources. The availability of a trusted market\nplace with\
    \ monetization mechanisms will allow third parties to generate eas-\nier revenue\
    \ streams from their urban data sources. This will encourage more\nbusinesses\
    \ to share currently closed data sources or incentivize deployments\nof new IoT\
    \ infrastructure as secondary revenue streams can be generated,\nmaking more business\
    \ cases viable. Data consumers may not require lengthy\nnegotiations of license\
    \ terms as data license terms can be negotiated from\npre-conﬁgured options of\
    \ the provider on the ﬂy.\n8.5.4 SynchroniCity Applications\nBased on the shared\
    \ architecture, SynchroniCity will deliver IoT-enabled\nurban services in the\
    \ eight reference zone cities. The services will be\ndeveloped and delivered in\
    \ an ambitious two-stage approach.\nFirst phase consists of three initial applications,\
    \ based on the highest\npriorities among the members of the global Open & Agile\
    \ Smart Cities\ninitiative, a network of more than 100 cities worldwide which\
    \ includes the\nSynchroniCity reference zones:\n• Community Policy Suite\n• Context-adaptive\
    \ trafﬁc management\n• Multi-modal transportation\nThese applications are fairly\
    \ standard services nowadays. However, there\nare still signiﬁcant gaps when it\
    \ comes to actually delivering them at scale,\nbased on digital single market\
    \ principles. Not all the SynchroniCity cities are\ninvolved in the deployment\
    \ of all the initial applications.\nThe following phase is called “enrichment\
    \ of the eco-system”, and it adds\nanother wave of new applications to the SynchroniCity\
    \ portfolio, based on\nan open call where new companies and cities may propose\
    \ applications and\nservices built on top of the SynchroniCity architectural principles.\n\
    8.5 SynchroniCity: Delivering a Digital Single Market\n255\nFigure 8.18\nInteractive\
    \ light art in Eindhoven.\nA total of 3 million Euros has been allocated for the\
    \ new applications, and\nthe call for participation will launch in the spring\
    \ of 2018.\nTaken together, the applications developed and deployed at large scale\n\
    in SynchroniCity will form a substantial contribution to a global market for\n\
    IoT-enabled urban services.\n8.5.5 Impact Creation\nSynchroniCity consists of\
    \ eight core reference zones in as many cities, but\nthe ambition is to go well\
    \ beyond this starting point: beyond the reference\nzone to the entire city, beyond\
    \ a single silo to span multiple domains, and to\ngo beyond Europe.\nTo reach\
    \ this goal, the project was founded on a strong partnership basis\nwith existing\
    \ initiatives and communities, and has deﬁned a set of ambitious\nKPIs.\nAt the\
    \ core of SynchroniCity is the Open & Agile Smart Cities initiative\n(OASC)4 which\
    \ is a global network of national networks of more than\n4www.oascities.org\n\
    256\nIoT European Large-Scale Pilots – Integration, Experimentation and Testing\n\
    100 cities in 23 countries that are working together to contribute to the\nestablishment\
    \ of a simple set of mechanisms for technical interoperability and\ncomparability\
    \ based on the needs of cities, i.e. the demand-side in the market.\nBy adding\
    \ global partners in Mexico, USA, Korea and Brazil, SynchroniCity\nspans a large\
    \ diversity which is a characteristic of a global market. Potentially,\nthe entire\
    \ OASC network can easily adapt and deploy the SynchroniCity\napplications. Figure\
    \ 8.15 shows the European reference zones, the global\npartners and the OASC cities.\n\
    A key focus of SynchroniCity is to contribute to the development of\ncommon speciﬁcations\
    \ and ultimately standards. As shown in Figure 8.19\nbelow, SynchroniCity takes\
    \ input not only from OASC and the cities directly\ninvolved in the project, but\
    \ also from other large initiatives, including promi-\nnently the FIWARE5 initiative\
    \ and the European Innovation Partnership on\nSmart Cities and Communities (EIP-SCC)6.\
    \ Through targeted activities and\ndeliverables as well as participation directly\
    \ in the speciﬁcation and standards\ndevelopment, SynchroniCity is contributing\
    \ directly to a number of streams,\nincluding the ETSI Industry Speciﬁcation Group\
    \ on Context Information\nManagement (ETSI ISG CIM)7, the ITU-T Focus Group on\
    \ Data Process-\ning and Management for Smart Cities and Communities (FG-DPM)8,\
    \ and\nISO/TC 268 on Sustainable cities and communities9. The project actively\n\
    supports and contributes to the UN Sustainable Development Goals10.\nBy having\
    \ the open call where actors outside of the SynchroniCity project\nconsortium\
    \ are invited to enrich the eco-system, SynchroniCity actively seeks\nto facilitate\
    \ support and impact beyond the closed group of initial partners.\n8.5.6 Conclusions\
    \ and Outlook\nSynchroniCity has a clear ambition to deliver local value in cities\
    \ and commu-\nnities based on the global dynamics of digital connectivity, innovation\
    \ power\nand capital. So far, efforts to create a global multi-sided market based\
    \ on\ndemand-side needs have not been successful. With the approach described\n\
    above, the partners in the SynchroniCity consortium propose an approach\n5www.ﬁware.org\n\

    \ by Internet Of Things” (AUTOPILOT) is\na three-year project that started in\
    \ January 2017, receiving funding from the\nEuropean Union’s Horizon 2020 research\
    \ and innovation programme. The\nAUTOPILOT consortium, consisting of 45 partners,\
    \ represents all relevant\nareas of the Internet of Things (IoT) eco-system. Its\
    \ overall objective to\nenable safer highly automated driving through smart and\
    \ connected objects –\nthe IoT11.\n11Fischer, F. & Corazza, F. (2017).\n258\n\
    IoT European Large-Scale Pilots – Integration, Experimentation and Testing\n8.6.1\
    \ Project Overview\nDuring the last decade, numerous IoT technologies have been\
    \ developed by\nthe research community, including IoT software engineering tools\
    \ and tech-\nniques, schemes for safeguarding security/privacy as well as infrastructures.\n\
    Built upon these recently ﬁnished or ongoing research and innovation activi-\n\
    ties, AUTOPILOT focuses on utilising the IoT potential for automated driving\n\
    and on making data from autonomous cars available to the IoT. In particular,\n\
    AUTOPILOT aims to bring together relevant knowledge and technology\nfrom automotive\
    \ and IoT value chains in order to develop IoT-architectures\nand platforms to\
    \ explore the growing market for mobility services. IoT-\nenabled autonomous cars\
    \ are tested, in real conditions, at six large-scale\nsites, whose test results\
    \ will allow multi-criteria evaluations (technical, user,\nbusiness, legal) of\
    \ the IoT impact on pushing the level of autonomous\ndriving.\n8.6.1.1 Objective\n\
    Connectivity and the ability to collect data from thousands of objects sur-\n\
    rounding vehicles are key enablers for highly automated driving. The IoT\nprovides\
    \ the mechanisms and tools to create virtual objects in the Cloud\nfrom real connected\
    \ objects, thereby allowing these objects to become more\nautomated in the not-so-distant\
    \ future.\nOverall, AUTOPILOT pursues ﬁve main objectives. First, it seeks to\n\
    enhance the vehicle’s understanding of its environment, utilising IoT sensors.\n\
    Second, the project sets out to foster innovation in automotive IoT and\nmobility\
    \ services. Third, it wants to use and evaluate advanced vehicle-\nto-everything\
    \ connectivity technologies. Fourth, AUTOPILOT is designed\nto involve users,\
    \ public services and businesses to assess the IoT’s socio-\neconomic beneﬁts.\
    \ Last, the project aims to contribute to the standardisation\nof IoT eco-systems\
    \ worldwide.\nMore concretely, AUTOPILOT proceeds in four steps (see Figure 8.20).\n\
    On large-scale test sites, data is collected in an IoT eco-system, deﬁned as\n\
    “objects in the physical world, which are capable of being identiﬁed and\nintegrated\
    \ into communication networks”. Next, this data is collated and\nFigure 8.20\n\
    Project ﬂow.\n8.6 AUTOPILOT – Automated Driving Progressed by Internet of Things\n\
    259\nanalysed in an IoT Platform, deﬁned as “interconnecting things based on\n\
    existing and evolving interoperable ICTs”, which is speciﬁcally dedicated\nto\
    \ Automated Driving (see Section 8.6.2.1). The IoT Platform is then used\nfor\
    \ four use cases to test applications on Automated Driving (see Section\n8.6.2.2).\
    \ Ultimately, AUTOPILOT suggests some services, which can serve\nas business models\
    \ for translating IoT Applications (see Section 8.6.2.3) into\ntangible offers\
    \ for end users of automated driving.\n8.6.1.2 Partners\nThe AUTOPILOT consortium\
    \ brings together 45 partners from multiple\ncountries and diverse backgrounds.\
    \ The consortium is a balanced mix of\norganisations working in IoT as well as\
    \ in Automation. This cooperation\nis an asset, because both industries have a\
    \ very different approach to data\nsharing and vehicle control. IoT devices are\
    \ by deﬁnition shared and open\nwhile automotive electronics are closed and safety-critical.\
    \ The partner con-\nstellation in AUTOPILOT helps to overcome this problem and\
    \ thus fosters\nimplementation of IoT solutions in future vehicle architecture.\
    \ The idea\nbehind the consortium is to combine a wide range of knowledge areas\n\
    to foster the project’s effectiveness in attaining its objectives. Lastly, the\n\
    AUTOPILOT consortium provides an avenue for authorities into the project.\nCity\
    \ authorities of the project sites are as much part of the consortium as are\n\
    road operators.\nOverall, the AUTOPILOT consortium can be characterised in four\
    \ clus-\nters: (1) those developing AD vehicles, (2) those developing IoT and\
    \ net-\nworks, (3) those collecting data to evaluate the systems and their potential\n\
    impacts, and, (4) those potentially developing innovative services based on\n\
    the results. This comprehensive mix of partners is a key to the project.\n8.6.2\
    \ Project Approach\nAUTOPILOT follows a two-track approach, composed of both pragmatic\
    \ and\nconceptual platform development. On the one hand, the pragmatic architec-\n\
    ture serves not only as starting point for the development of the conceptual\n\
    and uniﬁed platform but also as starting point for the use cases at the different\n\
    Pilot Sites. On the other hand, the conceptual architecture is deployed very\n\
    early and can be used by any new development. The conceptual architecture\nis\
    \ to be used as the reference for discussion and collaboration with other\nLarge\
    \ Scale Pilots. To swiftly achieve tangible results, AUTOPILOT utilises\npragmatically\
    \ existing systems or other available installations.\n260\nIoT European Large-Scale\
    \ Pilots – Integration, Experimentation and Testing\nIn addition, AUTOPILOT adopts\
    \ an iterative approach for innovation\nactivities, known as Iterative and Incremental\
    \ Development (IDD). The main\nrationale for IID in the design phase is to allow\
    \ the project to better adapt to\nchanging contexts, requirements, technological\
    \ developments and boundary\nconditions. Therefore, the requirements are not frozen\
    \ at the early stage of\nthe project but will be reviewed based on preliminary\
    \ evaluation results.\nA maximum of three cycles is foreseen, whereas the need\
    \ for applying\nall cycles is likely to be different for the partners and Pilot\
    \ Sites, according\nto their level of maturity in IoT and automated driving at\
    \ the start of the\nproject. The multiple cycle approach offers all partners the\
    \ necessary level of\nﬂexibility concerning their participation in the project\
    \ as well as harmonising\ntheir contributions to the project.\nThe speciﬁc motivation\
    \ for this approach in AUTOPILOT is threefold:\nFirst, there is a technical justiﬁcation.\
    \ One needs to merge the need to\nintegrate many different components, with the\
    \ need to start from existing\nsolutions and adapt to users’ early feedbacks.\
    \ Second, there is an organisa-\ntional justiﬁcation, as Pilot Sites will learn\
    \ from each other between cycles.\nThird, there is a business justiﬁcation, as\
    \ initial solutions to show on the\ndemand side can pointedly visualise the demand\
    \ side to IoT solutions for\nautomated road transport.\n8.6.2.1 AUTOPILOT’s IOT\
    \ Platform\nAUTOPILOT’s IoT Platform is held responsible on six parameters of\
    \ design.\n• Standard-Based: Legacy or proprietary IoT systems can be integrated\n\
    into a common system;\n• Abstraction: Abstraction-based information model following\
    \ estab-\nlished High-Level IoT Architecture;\n• Federation: Private and public\
    \ IoT systems can co-exist and collaborate\non-demand;\n• Semantic: Based on formal\
    \ semantics to achieve automated processing\nof large variety of information;\n\
    • Functional Distribution: Architecture enabling functional elements to be\nallocated\
    \ into systems;\n• Security: Provision of security functions and implementation\
    \ of the\n“Privacy-by-Design” principles.\nToday’s IoT installations are mainly\
    \ Intranet-of-Things meaning closed sys-\ntems developed for a single commercial\
    \ purpose and all following the same\ndesign principles. But the vision of AUTOPILOT\
    \ is calling for an open IoT\n8.6 AUTOPILOT – Automated Driving Progressed by\
    \ Internet of Things\n261\nsystem, in which many participants are publishing and\
    \ consuming IoT data\nand services. This is alike the Internet in which many participants\
    \ can operate\ntheir own Web site. As shown with traditional Web-based systems,\
    \ there is a\nneed for aggregation and federation services, supporting developer\
    \ and end-\nuser with high-quality services (e.g. Google search, hotel booking\
    \ engines,\nnews aggregation services).\nThose services are especially needed\
    \ in the IoT for autonomous driving\nareas. Automated driving service operators\
    \ will prefer to use a single ser-\nvice, delivering high quality and reliable\
    \ information, rather than having to\ninterface with thousands of information\
    \ sources and service providers. This is\ncalled the IoT Federation, where autonomous\
    \ systems agreed to collaborate\nby exchanging data and providing services to\
    \ each other. The AUTOPILOT\nconceptual architecture provides such federation\
    \ mechanism following the\nfederation design principle. For example, for data\
    \ access the FIWARE IoT\nBroker provides a large-scale federation infrastructure.\
    \ Federation enables a\nﬁner grain control over IoT information compared to centralised\
    \ IoT clouds.\nFederation also enables privacy-by-design thanks to clear policies\
    \ and control\npoints for information access.\nToday’s autonomous driving applications\
    \ are relying on autonomous\nvehicle systems in which the needed information is\
    \ gathered, processed and\nanalysed on the vehicles themselves. As a consequence,\
    \ the vehicle platform\ncan base its driving and manoeuvring decisions solely\
    \ on local information\n(Autonomous Car Zone). In the past year, newer approaches\
    \ for cooperative\ndriving have emerged, where driving functions take information\
    \ gathered\nfrom other devices into account, e.g. using Car2Car or Car2Infra approaches\n\
    (Cooperation Zone). With the emergence of the IoT, autonomous driving\nservices\
    \ can utilise IoT devices from the surrounding as well as services from\nthe Cloud\n\
    8.6.2.2 Project Sites and Applications\nAUTOPILOT employs large numbers of vehicles\
    \ under normal trafﬁc con-\nditions, for which trials are being conducted at six\
    \ large-scale Pilot Sites\n(Table 8.2).\n• The Finnish Pilot Site, located in\
    \ Tampere provides different outdoor\nconditions, such as slippery intersection\
    \ in winter time, low visibility\nfor environment perception sensors due to fog.\n\
    • The French Pilot Site is located in downtown Versailles, close to the\ncastle.\
    \ Its goal is to provide mobility services for tourists, based on a\nsmall ﬂeet\
    \ of automated vehicles and dedicated to a car-sharing.\n262\nIoT European Large-Scale\
    \ Pilots – Integration, Experimentation and Testing\n• The Italian Pilot Site,\
    \ is a testing infrastructure encompassing the\nFlorence-Livorno highway together\
    \ with road access to the settlement\naround the Livorno seaport.\n• The Korean\
    \ Pilot Site in Daejeon focuses on road situation information\nat an intersection,\
    \ which is challenging for automated vehicles because\nof the large number of\
    \ obstacles to be encountered there.\n• The Dutch Pilot consists of three different\
    \ test areas, including the\nEindhoven University campus, the automotive campus\
    \ parking, and a\n6 km stretch of the A270 motorway.\n• The Spanish Pilot Site\
    \ is located in Vigo, covering the city’s main street.\nIt provides an operational\
    \ test on cooperative systems between different\ntypes of vehicles and for underground\
    \ parking.\nAUTOPILOT deploys four different automated driving use cases: Automated\n\
    Valet Parking (AVP) is a driverless Automated Driving use case including\non-street\
    \ car drop-off, driving to and from a parking spot, forwards and back-\nwards\
    \ manoeuvring as well as on-street passenger pick-up. The IoT allows\nthis use\
    \ case to be a Level 4 scenario, since data and control from different\ninfrastructure\
    \ sensors is essential. IoT functions include routing (parking\navailability through\
    \ sensors), localisation of obstacles (parking cameras) and\neven control decision\
    \ making at the IoT Edge.\nTable 8.2\nAUTOPILOT project sites and applications\n\
    8.6 AUTOPILOT – Automated Driving Progressed by Internet of Things\n263\nHighway\
    \ Use is a use case focused on Automated Driving on motorways\nfrom entrance to\
    \ exit, on all lanes, incl. overtaking. The driver must deliber-\nately activate\
    \ the system, but does not have to monitor the system constantly.\nThere are no\
    \ requests from the system to the driver to take over when the\nsystems in normal\
    \ operation area (i.e. on the motorway). Depending on the\ndeployment of cooperative\
    \ systems ad-hoc convoys could also be created if\nV2V communication is available.\n\
    The use case for Platooning is an Automated Driving scenario where fully\nautomated\
    \ driving or driverless vehicles will join and drive in a platoon, with\na leading\
    \ vehicle in front. The driving mode is very similar to the Highway\nPilot, however\
    \ driving in a platoon requires the vehicle to use advanced V2V\ncommunications.\
    \ Two variants of platooning will be deployed and evaluated\nin AUTOPILOT, an\
    \ urban one and a highway one.\nThe Urban Driving use case is based on the ERTRAC\
    \ “Fully automated\nprivate vehicle” representing the SAE level 5, where “The\
    \ fully automated\nvehicle should be able to handle all driving from point A to\
    \ B, without any\ninput from the passenger.”\n8.6.2.3 Services the intersection\
    \ of IoT and automation\nAs stipulated in its acronym, AUTOPILOT seeks to foster\
    \ the progress of\nautomated driving. For this purpose, it makes use of the innovation\
    \ of IoT\ndevelopments in the ﬁeld. Throughout the project, members of the consor-\n\
    tium will work to develop eight speciﬁc services that draw on the use case\napplications\
    \ of IoT (see Table 8.3). These services fulﬁl a double function.\nOn the one\
    \ hand, they make the idea of automated driving progressed through\nthe IoT tangible\
    \ for end users. On the other hand, they suggest viable business\nmodels for stakeholders\
    \ that will carry on the ﬁndings of AUTOPILOT even\nafter it ended.\n8.6.3 Project\
    \ Impact\nTo provide quantitative and qualitative evidence of the added value\
    \ of IoT\ntechnology for automated driving, all large-scale Pilot tests are evaluated\n\
    using the established FESTA methodology. The added value is formulated\nin hypotheses\
    \ on objectives, ambitions and impact, and is measured in Key\nPerformance Indicators\
    \ (KPIs) or metrics from several perspectives. Data\nanalyses and (technical)\
    \ evaluation will be executed simultaneously with\npiloting to provide immediate\
    \ feedback on test executing and input for the\nnext iteration of development.\n\

    \ with the IoT eco-system.\n8.7 CREATE-IoT Cross Fertilisation through Alignment,\n\
    Synchronisation and Exchanges for IoT\nCREATE-IoT is the coordination and support\
    \ action involving all IoT Euro-\npean Large-Scale Pilots innovation actions projects,\
    \ articulating altogether\nthe IoT European Large-Scale Pilots Programme that\
    \ is built around eight\nactivity groups. Through an active participation of these\
    \ activity groups, IoT\nLarge-Scale Pilot projects are able to contribute to the\
    \ consolidation and\ncoherence work that is implemented by the CREATE-IoT and\
    \ U4IOT. This\nis done by supporting the clustering activities deﬁned by the Programme\
    \ and\naddressing issues of common interest such as interoperability approach,\
    \ stan-\ndards, security and privacy approaches, business validation and sustainability,\n\
    methodologies, metrics, etc.\nThe ultimate goal of the IoT European Large-Scale\
    \ Pilots Programme\nand the coordination/collaboration activities is to increase\
    \ the impact of\nthe activities and development in the IoT Large-Scale Pilots\
    \ on citizens,\npublic and private spheres, industry, businesses and public services.\
    \ The\nactivity groups are key enablers for the identiﬁcation of key performance\n\
    indicators to measure progress on citizen beneﬁts, economic growth, jobs\ncreation,\
    \ environment protection, productivity gains, etc. The coordination\nmechanisms\
    \ implemented through the activity groups will help to ensure\na sound coherence\

    \ Joint Technology Initiatives (e.g. ECSEL),\nEuropean Innovation Partnerships\
    \ (e.g. on Smart Cities), and other Focus\nAreas (e.g. on Autonomous transport).\n\
    The activity groups monitor that appropriate mechanisms are put in place\nso that\
    \ pilots’ impact can go beyond involved partners by also reaching\nexternal communities\
    \ and stakeholders. Special attention should be given\nto those pilot projects\
    \ which intend to launch open calls through cascade\nfunding. Mobilising a wider\
    \ community beyond the consortium is essential\nfor the development of a secure\
    \ and sustainable European IoT ecosystem.\nBeyond sustaining an ecosystem it is\
    \ instrumental to include contributions\nto assure that the IoT infrastructures\
    \ developed and implemented are viable\nbeyond the duration of the Pilots.\nThe\
    \ IoT European Large-Scale Pilots Programme coordination body led\nby the supporting\
    \ and coordination actions, being CREATE-IoT part of it,\nwill continuously monitor\
    \ and adapt through the activity groups the com-\nmon topics, challenges, best\
    \ practices in order to maximise the expected\nimpact of the IoT Large-Scale Pilots\

    \ from 9 European countries. The\nproject objectives are to stimulate collaboration\
    \ between IoT initiatives, foster\nthe take up of IoT in Europe and support the\
    \ development and growth of\nIoT ecosystems based on open technologies and platforms.\
    \ This requires\nsynchronisation and alignment on strategic and operational terms\
    \ through\n268\nIoT European Large-Scale Pilots – Integration, Experimentation\
    \ and Testing\nFigure 8.22\nCREATE-IoT activities.\nfrequent, multi-directional\
    \ exchanges between the various activities under the\nIoT Focus Areas as depicted\
    \ in Figure 8.22. It addresses cross fertilisation of\nthe various IoT Large Scale\
    \ Pilots for technological and validation issues\nof common interest across the\
    \ various application domains and use cases.\nThe project fosters the exchange\
    \ on requirements for legal accompanying\nmeasures, development of common methodologies\
    \ and KPIs for design,\ntesting and validation and for success and impact measurement,\
    \ federation\nof pilot activities and transfer to other pilot areas, facilitating\
    \ the access for\nIoT entrepreneurs/API developers/makers, SMEs, including combination\
    \ of\nICT and art.\nCREATE-IoT takes a holistic approach in facilitating the exchange\n\
    between the different IoT Large-Scale Pilot projects and providing the appro-\n\
    priate platform and tools that will enable fruitful cross-fertilization between\n\
    IoT Large-Scale Pilots.\n8.7.2 Conceptual Approach\nCREATE-IoT aims to provide\
    \ support to the different activities covered\nby the IoT Focus Area through the\
    \ development of a coherent strategy\nfor open exchanges and collaboration between\
    \ the various actors involved.\nCREATE-IoT is focusing on promoting and discovering\
    \ synergies across the\ndifferent axes of the IoT Focus Area, as shown in Figure\
    \ 8.23. The horizontal\nnature of (personal) data protection, security, user acceptance,\
    \ standardisa-\ntion, interoperability, creativity, societal and ethical aspects,\
    \ legal issues and\ninternational cooperation are coordinated across the whole\
    \ IoT ecosystem.\nSpecial attention is paid to the Large-Scale Pilots, but also\
    \ to other initiatives\n8.7 CREATE-IoT Cross Fertilisation through Alignment,\

    \ Area, and other related initiatives at EU and global level\ninvolving different\
    \ IoT communities, technology and innovation platforms,\netc. The project boosts\
    \ synergies, experience and knowledge sharing towards\nthe creation of an inclusive\
    \ IoT ecosystem, by deﬁning a set of best practices\nand business models that\
    \ will facilitate the replication of results and, thus,\nimprove the overall impact\
    \ of the parallel on-going activities, in particular\nthe IoT Large-Scale Pilot\
    \ projects. In summary, CREATE-IoT is working on:\n• Ensuring coherent exchanges\
    \ between the various activities of the Focus\nArea, and cross fertilisation of\
    \ the various pilots for technological and\nvalidation issues of common interest\
    \ across the various use cases.\n• Supporting and assessing the current IoT Large-Scale\
    \ Pilot projects,\nsharing best practices and aligning horizontal issues.\n• Developing\
    \ a more inclusive ecosystem where innovation, art and\ncreativity take active\
    \ part on it.\n• Proposing a framework for the coherent integration of the EU\
    \ IoT value\nchain, strengthening the links between different on-going initiatives\
    \ in\nthe IoT domain.\n• Fostering interoperability of existing and future IoT\
    \ solutions.\n270\nIoT European Large-Scale Pilots – Integration, Experimentation\
    \ and Testing\n• Implementing and developing a policy framework in the IoT domain\n\
    addressing the current horizontal issues that prevent the from massive\ndeployment\
    \ of IoT solutions, with a special focus on the trust and legal\ndomains.\nThe\
    \ project methodology is based on a clear deﬁnition of the current IoT\necosystem.\
    \ The work provides the overall foundation for common inter-\nlinking and coordination\
    \ activities: all relevant stakeholders, technologies,\nreference architectures\
    \ and business models will be the base over which\nthe project will grow. The\
    \ support to the IoT Large-Scale Pilot projects,\nas addressed by the project,\
    \ fosters the sharing of experiences both from\ntechnical and non-technical perspectives.\
    \ On the technical side, CREATE-\nIoT is focusing mainly on the federation of\
    \ experiments and IoT reference\narchitectures, whilst the non-technical side\
    \ aims at sharing experiences,\nassessment methodologies and business models.\
    \ The project exploits the\nsynergies between arts and IoT and position creativity\
    \ and innovation as a key\ndriver and enabler for the progress of IoT. The methodology\
    \ resulting from\nthis work is tested in the different LSPs. The project addresses\
    \ the creation\nof a framework for an integrated European IoT Value Chain that\
    \ will grow\nthe links between communities of IoT users and providers, as well\
    \ as with\nMember States’ initiatives and other related initiatives in the IoT\
    \ domain.\nThe development of a Policy Framework will help addressing the multiple\n\
    existing challenges, especially in the security and privacy domain, which\nare\
    \ hindering the wide adoption of IoT solutions. The requirements for\na trusted\
    \ IoT label are under discussion. This label would better position\nEU IoT solutions\
    \ in the global markets, being applicable not only to the\nwhole IoT Focus Area,\
    \ but also to other IoT domains. CREATE-IoT works\non supporting industrial consensus\
    \ building for implementing pre-normative\nand standardisation, coordinating the\
    \ activities with Standard Developing\nOrganizations (i.e. ISO, ETSI, CEN/CENELEC,\
    \ W3C, IETF, ITU, IEEE,\nOGC, etc.) and other various IoT Global Alliances (AIOTI,\
    \ IIC, Thread,\nAllJoyn, Open Connectivity Foundation (OCF), etc.), thus aligning\
    \ activities\nat the national, European and global level.\n8.7.3 Impact\nCREATE-IoT\
    \ provides the framework for supporting and coordinating the\nIoT Focus Area,\
    \ in order to foster the take up of IoT in Europe and enable the\nemergence of\
    \ IoT ecosystems supported by open technologies and platforms.\n8.7 CREATE-IoT\
    \ Cross Fertilisation through Alignment, Synchronisation\n271\nThis is done through\
    \ the coordination of complementary activities structured\naround IoT Large-Scale\
    \ Pilots\nThe project ensures the framework environment and provides tools to\n\
    ensure consistency and linkages between the pilots, complementing them by\naddressing\
    \ ethics and privacy, trust and security, respect for the scarcity and\nvulnerability\
    \ of human attention, validation and certiﬁcation, standards and\ninteroperability,\
    \ user acceptability and control, liability and sustainability.\nThe project implements\
    \ a coordination body that ensures an efﬁcient interplay\nof the various elements\
    \ of the IoT Focus Area and liaises with relevant\ninitiatives at EU, Member States\
    \ and international levels.\nFor today’s and tomorrow’s IoT products, services,\
    \ applications, solutions\ninfrastructure and ecosystems, it is crucial that the\
    \ society, its citizens and\nother (potential) customers and users have trust\
    \ in what they use, buy, wish\nto enjoy or are connected to. In order to create\
    \ a workable level of such trust\nand therewith durable adoption, one will need\
    \ to have comfort, the offer will\nneed to be credible and usable. In that scope,\
    \ concepts such as ethics, safety,\naccountability, security and privacy by design\
    \ have to be widely spread from\nthe early stages of development for IoT products,\
    \ services, applications, solu-\ntions infrastructure and ecosystems. To enable\
    \ large scale deployments of IoT\nsystems ensuring massive and durable user adoption,\
    \ it will be essential that\nIoT and related IoT ecosystems are based on complementary\
    \ architectures\nbased on similar principles, enabling to leverage across multiple\
    \ use cases and\nto catch the extra value arising from information exchange across\
    \ multiple\nsectors/domains.\nThe goal of the CREATE-IoT project is to put in\
    \ place an approach that\ncan federate the IoT Large-Scale Pilots and, beyond\
    \ them, other IoT and\nrelated ecosystems that are deployed worldwide. Given that\
    \ IoT applications\nare meant to affect the living environment with minimum involvement\
    \ from\nthe human side, security breaches may have direct impact on human safety,\n\
    and the privacy may be compromised by communications that happen without\nbeing\
    \ noticed. Furthermore, security in IoT environment is more challenging\nto be\
    \ achieved than in the traditional Internet of computers, due to power,\nbandwidth\
    \ and computing constraints. Therefore, it tends to be neglected\nin early deployments\
    \ despite its high criticality. In addition, the privacy\nrisk requires speciﬁc\
    \ overall horizontal attention across initiatives, because\nexposure of multiple\
    \ anonymized data about the life, from home energy\nconsumption to public transport\
    \ infrastructure usage and ofﬁce activities,\nfacilitates link ability to individual\
    \ identity, eventually compromising the pri-\nvacy of each anonymous data. These\
    \ aspects deserve speciﬁc attention in the\n272\nIoT European Large-Scale Pilots\
    \ – Integration, Experimentation and Testing\nsupervision activities. There are\
    \ many new ethical, legal and related questions\nand queries that need to be structured,\
    \ addressed, clariﬁed and sometimes\nrethought. There are many layers in any IoT\
    \ vertical and horizontal matters\nsuch as for instance (personal) data protection,\
    \ data management, security,\nproduct liability and net neutrality rise not once,\
    \ but actually several times per\nlayer. There are quite some layers necessary\
    \ in order to build an IoT vertical,\nlet alone the many cross-vertical data value\
    \ chains and liabilities that need to\nbe addressed.\nCREATE-IoT has an important\
    \ and critical impact on potential barriers,\non providing the stakeholders with\
    \ multi-angle and sufﬁcient knowledge,\nwith a trusted environment for the development\
    \ of IoT, and with compre-\nhensive technical and non-technical practical landscaped\
    \ guidelines, mecha-\nnisms, best practices and other legal and related knowledge,\
    \ and on giving\nsupport to projects across the IoT Focus Area. The ultimate aim\
    \ is to create\nthe Trusted IoT concept.\nCREATE-IoT’s expected impact is in ensuring\
    \ that start-ups, developers\nand SMEs are able to play a role in the new IoT\
    \ paradigm. One of the\nrequirements is that the platforms deployed across the\
    \ IoT Focus Areas must\nbe open to enable sustainability and continued innovation\
    \ and development\nof new cases. By ensuring that there are appropriate support\
    \ mechanisms for\nSMEs and start-up participation, CREATE-IoT is working to:\n\
    • Enable start-ups and SMEs to engage with the IoT Large-Scale Pilot\nprojects\
    \ and build the skills and technology base they need to be part of\nthe IoT ecosystem.\n\
    • Provide clarity about legal considerations on privacy and other related\ntopics.\n\
    • Invite disruptive innovation from stakeholders who have no proprietary\ntechnology\
    \ or legacy considerations.\n• Ensure that the voice of smaller and new businesses\
    \ across Europe can\nbe heard in the debates on standards and interoperability.\n\
    • Lay the foundations for truly open (although not necessarily free of\ncharge)\
    \ platforms that withstand changes in any given ecosystem.\nThe longer-term impact\
    \ of the support to SMEs is seen in Europe’s ability to\ncompete on the world\
    \ stage with new companies that can contribute to the\ncreation of skilled jobs\
    \ and economic growth. CREATE-IoT creates impact\nthrough the development and\
    \ implementation of a methodology to integrate\nartistic practices and creation\
    \ in IoT innovation, adoption and market pen-\netration. The exploitation of the\
    \ combination of ICT and the arts has direct\n8.8 U4IoT – User Engagement for\

    \ a critical approach to technology in the\ndesign, development, dissemination\
    \ of new products, technologies, services\nand experiences in various IoT application\
    \ domains.\nThe expected impact resulting from the combination of ICT and the\
    \ arts\ncan be summarized in few points:\n• Increased user adoption and conﬁdence\
    \ in IoT systems and IoT Large-\nScale Pilots thanks to the consideration of user-centric\
    \ methodologies\nand consumer-citizens assessment while emerged in IoT systems\
    \ and\nexperiences.\n• Boost of socially driven innovation processes in IoT thanks\
    \ to co-\ncreation methodologies and a solid critical approach enabled by artists\n\
    attributing meanings to technologies.\n• Enhanced promptness to innovate and enhanced\
    \ EU ICT competitive-\nness driven by the emerging hybrid ﬁeld of ICT and the\
    \ Arts supported\nby the EU Digital Agenda STARTS initiative.\n• Consolidation\
    \ of an EU IoT Art-Science cluster of practitioners that can\nextend the impact\
    \ of CREATE-IoT beyond its time frame and scope.\n8.8 U4IoT – User Engagement\
    \ for Large Scale Pilots\nin the Internet of Things\nThis chapter presents the\
    \ U4IoT Coordination and Support Action which\naims at supporting end-user engagement\
    \ in the ﬁve European Large-Scale\nPilots. It comprises a short introduction of\
    \ the project objectives followed by\na review of the various strands of work\
    \ aimed at achieving those objectives\nincluding enshrining participants’ right\
    \ to privacy and the protection of their\npersonal data.\n8.8.1 Introduction\n\
    U4IoT will support the Large Scale Pilots (LSPs) funded by the European\nCommission\
    \ in the context of the Horizon 2020 research programme. It will\nenable a citizen-driven\
    \ process by combining multidisciplinary expertise and\ncomplementary mechanisms\
    \ from state-of-the-art European organisations.\nIt will also analyse societal,\
    \ ethical, and ecological issues related to the\npilots in order to develop recommendations\
    \ for tackling IoT adoption barriers\nincluding educational needs and skill-building.\n\
    274\nIoT European Large-Scale Pilots – Integration, Experimentation and Testing\n\
    U4IoT combines a wide range of knowledge and experience from a\nnumber of leading\
    \ European partners in end-user engagement through crowd-\nsourcing, Living Labs,\
    \ co-creative workshops, and meetups designed to\nsupport end-user engagement\
    \ in the Large Scale Pilots. Its strategy is built\non four main sets of activities.\
    \ It will:\n• Develop a toolkit to facilitate the LSPs’ end-user engagement and\
    \ adop-\ntion activities including: online resources and tools for end-user engage-\n\
    ment; privacy-compliant crowdsourcing & crowdsensing tools and\nsurveys to assess\
    \ end-users’ acceptance of the pilots; online resources\nand an innovative game\
    \ that will promote awareness of privacy and per-\nsonal data protection risks\
    \ with guidelines on personal data protection;\n• Support and mobilise: end-user\
    \ engagement through the training and\nsupporting of the LSP teams so that they\
    \ may organise their own co-\ncreative workshops; meetups; training on the use\
    \ of crowdsourcing &\ncrowdsensing tools in an efﬁcient and privacy-friendly way\
    \ in line with\nIoT Lab12 tools; the presentation and facilitation of Living Labs\
    \ support;\nan online pool of experts for end-user engagement; online training\n\
    modules.\n• Analyse societal, ethical, and ecological issues related to the pilots’\n\
    end-users and make recommendations based on the analysis of IoT\nadoption barriers\
    \ and how to tackle them including education and skill-\nbuilding. It will leverage\
    \ on end-user interactions to design participatory\nsustainability models that\
    \ can be replicated across LSPs and future IoT\npilots.\n• Support communication,\
    \ knowledge-sharing, and dissemination includ-\ning: the development of an interactive\
    \ website with an online toolkit as\nwell as online knowledge database on lessons\
    \ learned, FAQs, solutions,\nand end-user feedback. It will support the end-user\
    \ communication and\noutreach strategies for LSPs and will enable information-sharing\
    \ and\nretro-feed towards LSPs and their end-users.\n8.8.2 Engaging End-Users\
    \ throughout the Life of the LSPs\nOne of the key objectives of U4IoT is to support\
    \ and promote end-user\nengagement across the entire lifecycle of the Large Scale\
    \ Pilots from design,\nto implementation, through to assessment. More speciﬁcally,\
    \ the project will\nencourage and support:\n12www.iotlab.eu\n8.8 U4IoT – User\

    \ in the design phase of the LSPs\nU4IoT will provide methodologies, such as the\
    \ co-creative workshops, that\nwill enable pilots to involve the local end-users\
    \ from the beginning of the\nproject.\nEnd-user engagement in the implementation\
    \ phase of the LSPs\nU4IoT will provide a complete set of tools to actively engage\
    \ end-users in the\ndesign and implementation of the pilots’ products and services.\n\
    End-user engagement in the exploitation and assessment phase\nof the LSPs\nPrivacy-friendly\
    \ crowdsourcing and survey tools will enable the pilots to\nmonitor end-user perception\
    \ and acceptance of their projects during the\nimplementation phase. It will enable\

    \ in Figure 8.24 below.\n8.8.3 Embedding Personal Data Protection by Design\n\
    U4IoT will adopt a privacy-by-design approach. It will comply with the\nnew General\

    \ also has\nexperts on gaming methodologies. One intended outcome will be the\
    \ creation\nof a game whose aim is to raise awareness on privacy in connection\
    \ with the\nInternet of Things. This will help to better connect with end-users\
    \ and raise\nawareness of personal data protection issues and challenges they\
    \ will face as\nthe technology achieves greater social penetration.\n8.8.4 Developing\
    \ an Ad Hoc Toolkit for End-User Engagement\nU4IoT is developing a customised\
    \ toolkit for end-user engagement in the\nLarge Scale Pilots, including:\nOnline\
    \ resources for pilots including tools for end-user uptake\nU4IoT will identify,\
    \ gather, and provide relevant tools and online resources\nfor end-user engagement\
    \ including strategic guidelines and steps for user\nengagement and a pool of\
    \ methodologies and tools to be used in different\nstates or steps in product\
    \ and service co-design and co-creation. U4IoT will\nprovide resources supporting\
    \ LSPs in engaging end-users in their pilots. The\nonline resources will be hosted\
    \ on the project website. In addition, U4IoT will\ncompile these resources and\
    \ advice into a practical handbook for the Internet\nof Things pilot deployments.\
    \ The handbook will also be designed to serve\nfuture Internet of Things pilots.\n\
    Crowdsourcing and survey tools\nU4IoT is leveraging and customising the crowdsourcing\
    \ and crowd-\nsensing tool developed by the European research project IoT Lab\n\
    (http://www.iotlab.eu). It enables researchers to collect fully anonymised\ninput\
    \ and feedback from end-users through a smart phone application in order\nto assess,\
    \ ﬁne-tune, and validate end-user acceptance of IoT deployments. It\nis particularly\
    \ well-suited for large-scale IoT deployments.\nGuidelines and an interactive\
    \ game for privacy and personal data\nprotection\nU4IoT will develop a game to\
    \ educate and raise awareness on IoT and\nprivacy issues among the LSPs’ stakeholders\
    \ and their end-users. Our goal\n8.8 U4IoT – User Engagement for Large Scale Pilots\
    \ in the Internet of Things\n277\nis to develop a game that fully integrates some\
    \ basic concepts of privacy\n(mainly online and IoT privacy) into a working and\
    \ enjoyable mechanism\nthrough which understanding such concepts becomes crucial\
    \ to succeeding\nin the game. Different versions of the game will be considered\
    \ and an\ninteractive game will be developed in close collaboration with the partners\
    \ of\nthe project and end-users. The game will highlight key concepts of personal\n\
    data protection such as: a priori informed consent, proﬁling, data processing,\n\
    anonymity, pseudonymity, etc. The game will focus on privacy issues related\n\
    to Smart Cities and the Internet of Things.\nU4IoT website and dissemination\n\
    All presentations, documents, online tools, knowledge database, etc. will\nbe\
    \ made available and maintained on the U4IoT website. Not only will it\ndocument\
    \ the activities of the project, but will also provide tools for interac-\ntion\
    \ with relevant projects and users. The website will be used as a source\nfor\
    \ other promotion and dissemination channels such as social networks,\nwhich will\
    \ complement end-user engagement activities done “out and about”.\nTo this end,\
    \ the “mood of the city” kiosk will be used as a means of attracting\ninterest\
    \ and spreading information about the project and related activities.\nOnline\
    \ knowledge database on lessons learned, solutions, and user\nfeedback\nAnother\
    \ important element of the project is the development of a knowledge\nbase on\
    \ lessons learned, solutions, and user feedback. It will be maintained\nand regularly\
    \ updated in order to capitalise on experiences and lessons\nlearned. At the end\
    \ of the project, the knowledge base and online platform\nwill be formally transferred\
    \ to the IoT Forum who has agreed to maintain it.\n8.8.5 Supporting and Mobilising\
    \ End-User Engagement\nBeyond the development of tools, U4IoT considers that direct\
    \ support to\nthe Large Scale Pilots is required as a complementary measure to\
    \ enable\neffective end-user engagement. A set of support actions and services\
    \ are being\ndeveloped:\nCo-creative workshops\nCo-creative workshops can support\
    \ end-user engagement in the early stages\nof the LSPs by co-designing solutions\
    \ in a multi-stakeholder setting. During\nthe workshop, collective knowledge of\
    \ end-users, local stakeholders, and\n278\nIoT European Large-Scale Pilots – Integration,\
    \ Experimentation and Testing\nexperts from LSPs is exchanged, combined, and captured.\
    \ The co-creative\nworkshop methodology and toolkit enables experts to empathise\
    \ with the\nneeds of end-users while end-users are empowered to communicate on\
    \ an\nexpert level. The workshop program results in one or more use cases that\
    \ are\nco-created by the participants.\nAnalysing and converting the qualitative\
    \ data gathered throughout the\nworkshop leads to a variety of functional requirements\
    \ that are based on\nend-user needs, however, designing, organising, facilitating,\
    \ analysing, and\nimplementing co-creative workshops in LSPs can be challenging.\
    \ U4IoT\ntherefore aims to offer a co-creative training program to increase end-user\n\
    engagement during the beginning of many LSPs in the IoT-1 call.\nIn this training\
    \ program, experts from different LSPs are invited to learn\nhow to implement\
    \ and utilise co-creative workshops in their projects. Experts\nwill interact\
    \ directly with end-users through the co-creative workshops, ide-\nally increasing\
    \ empathy and leading to more meaningful IoT-related solutions\nthat are based\
    \ on the needs of end-users. More LSPs adopting the co-creative\nworkshop methodology\
    \ will lower the threshold for involving end-users in\nfuture LSPs and improve\
    \ our knowledge on applying this methodology in\ndifferent contexts.\nLiving Labs\
    \ methodology support\nU4IoT will also provide the LSPs with Living Lab methodology\
    \ support.\nHere, the LSPs will get access to guidelines and services online regarding\n\
    how to apply Living Lab methodologies within the LSPs. Through this, the\nLSPs\
    \ get guidelines on how to develop open and user-driven innovation\necosystems\
    \ that support end-user engagement in the IoT pilots from the\nearly phases and\
    \ throughout the whole pilot. In relation to this, U4IoT will\nprovide dedicated\
    \ on-demand advisory support for the LSPs in Living Lab\napproaches. This methodology\
    \ support will mainly be provided as an online\ntool with webinars and online\
    \ supporting services.\nOnline pool of experts for end-user engagement\nThe U4IoT\
    \ online training programme will assist LSPs to set up and deploy\nan effective\
    \ end-user engagement strategy. The components of the pro-\ngramme consist of\
    \ an interactive ﬂow-diagram, e-courses, example materials,\nand an expert pool.\
    \ The online pool will be a list of experts with details of\ntheir speciﬁc expertise.\
    \ The pool will be available online and is part of a front-\ndesk that also contains\
    \ a list of end-user communities for open calls and a list\nof FAQs. The LSPs\
    \ can use the list to contact experts directly for questions\nand answers or for\
    \ custom advise and coaching on end-user engagement.\n8.8 U4IoT – User Engagement\
    \ for Large Scale Pilots in the Internet of Things\n279\n8.8.6 Recommendations\
    \ on IoT Adoption and the Sustainability\nof IoT Pilots\nTackling IoT adoption\
    \ barriers\nU4IoT will start by analysing societal, ethical, and ecological issues\
    \ related\nto the pilots with end-users and develop a set of corresponding recommen-\n\
    dations. This will be achieved by analysing IoT adoption barriers and pro-\nvide\
    \ guidelines for tackling these barriers, including educational needs and\nskill-building.\n\
    Sustainability models for IoT pilots\nU4IoT will design sustainability models\
    \ for the LSPs. These models are\nparticipatory and leverage on end-user interactions\
    \ by involving not only the\nLSPs themselves, but also their various stakeholders\
    \ and target audiences,\nfrom companies to public organisations to citizens. The\
    \ U4IoT sustainability\nmodels will be designed to help the LSPs and their stakeholders,\
    \ but can also\nbe replicated in future IoT pilot deployment throughout Europe.”\n\
    8.8.7 Collaboration, Outreach, and Dissemination\nA key factor of success for\
    \ the project resides in its capacity to outreach\ntowards the relevant stakeholder.\
    \ The collaboration, outreach and dissemina-\ntion strategy is threefold:\nCooperation\
    \ strategy with the LSPs\nU4IoT will work in close interaction with the LSPs and\
    \ will offer its sup-\nport to each LSP consortium from the beginning of the project.\
    \ U4IoT\nwill organise joint meetings and ad hoc training activities for all LSPs.\n\
    In parallel, U4IoT will collaborate closely with the other CSA and the\nEuropean\
    \ Commission.\nCooperation strategy with the IoT Ecosystem and the IoT Forum\n\
    U4IoT will work closely with the IoT ecosystem and will contribute to the\nvisibility\
    \ and outreach of the LSPs. U4IoT will also work closely with the\nIoT Forum (chaired\
    \ by MI), the AIOTI, the IERC, the ITU, and IEEE (more\ndetails in Section 8.2).\n\
    The IoT Forum will play an important role in supporting the interaction\nwith\
    \ the IoT research community, as well as in ensuring a long-term exploita-\ntion\
    \ and maintenance of the U4IoT online tools and platform.\n280\nIoT European Large-Scale\
    \ Pilots – Integration, Experimentation and Testing\nEnd-users outreach, engagement,\
    \ and active involvement\nU4IoT’s main users are the consortia leading the Large\
    \ Scale Pilots imple-\nmentation. The prime focus of U4IoT is to enable active\
    \ participation and\nengagement of ﬁnal end-users in the pilots. Beyond the end-user\
    \ engagement\nmethodologies provided and developed in coordination with the pilots,\
    \ U4IoT\nwill also provide transparent information on its website with resources\
    \ made\navailable to ﬁnal end-users too.\n8.8.8 A Systemic and Cybernetic Approach\
    \ for End-User\nEngagement\nThrough its aforementioned activities, U4IoT is following\
    \ a fully integrated\nand systematic approach. It intends to follow and enable\
    \ a virtuous cycle by\ncollecting and internalising the feedback from the various\
    \ stakeholders. The\nmodel adopted by U4IoT is summarised in Figure 8.25.\nThe\
    \ analytical part is central and enables us to develop the knowledge,\nadapt and\
    \ improve the support, and ﬁne-tune the tools. These elements are\nthen applied\
    \ to the LSPs. The results are then monitored and analysed, closing\nthe loop.\n\
    Figure 8.25\nU4IoT General Methodology.\nReferences\n281\n8.8.9 Discussion\nU4IoT\
    \ stands as the primary support that the LSPs of the IoT-1 call will\nuse to engage\
    \ with their audiences and develop deep connections with their\nend-users. This\
    \ will be achieved largely due to the extensive experience and\nknowledge base\
    \ of the U4IoT partners, which they will provide to the LSPs\nboth ofﬂine and\
    \ online. Continuous support will be provided through our\nonline portal and via\
    \ an expert pool that will cover all the relevant topics and\nissues that the\
    \ LSPs are likely to face in the realm of end-user engagement.\nExpert knowledge\
    \ will be accompanied and underpinned by technical\ntools including state-of-the-art\
    \ crowdsourcing technology, by a robust legal\nframework, and by innovative engagement\
    \ methodologies such as the privacy\ngame and co-creative workshops. All of this\
    \ will be achieved while simulta-\nneously accounting for societal, ethical, and\
    \ ecological considerations.\nReferences\n[1] European Commission: The 2015 ageing\

    SHARE Abstract This study investigates the distributed stochastic model predictive
    control (DSMPC) algorithm design for a class of networked subsystems with stochastic
    disturbances and coupled probabilistic constraints, differently from the existing
    work, the network-induced imperfections such as time-varying delays and quantisation
    process are considered. A probabilistic constraint handling strategy and a novel
    DSMPC implementation algorithm are presented. In addition, according to the probabilistic
    distribution of the uncertainties, the probabilistic constraints are transformed
    into a set of determinate constraints. Although the closed-loop system is affected
    by the time-varying delays and quantisation process, the quadratic stability of
    the closed-loop system and the feasibility of the optimisation problem can still
    be guaranteed with the developed algorithm. Finally, a numerical example is provided
    to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed results. 1 Introduction Stochastic
    model predictive control (SMPC) has been an active research area in the past decade,
    especially for large-scale industrial systems. Compared with robust MPC (RMPC),
    SMPC not only takes into account the stochastic characteristics of the uncertainties
    but also allows violations of constraints, although such violations are required
    to satisfy probabilistic constraints [1–3]. An important property of probabilistic
    constraints is that it enables SMPC to contain the tradeoff between the satisfaction
    of constraints and control performance, thus, the conservatism of RMPC [4–7] can
    be reduced. A soft constraint approach was proposed for constrained SMPC of linear
    systems with multiplicative noise in [8], where an online optimisation problem
    was given to penalise constraint violations. Based on a dynamic model, an SMPC
    of the air-fuel ratio was designed using MPC theoretic framework of Markovian
    jump systems in [9], where the advantages of SMPC controller were shown. However,
    centralised MPC was utilised in these works and probabilistic constraints were
    not included in the MPC design. Up to date, there are three major methods for
    single-system SMPC, such as stochastic tube methods [10, 11], affine parameterisation
    methods [12, 13] and sample-based methods [14, 15]. The stochastic tube method
    is more flexible for distributed systems compared with the other two methods,
    this method was used in [10] to deal with the probabilistic constraints, and a
    necessary and sufficient condition was proposed to ensure the satisfaction of
    the probabilistic constraints. An SMPC strategy similar to nominal MPC was presented
    in [11] to deal with the probabilistic constraints, the cross-sectional shape
    of a tube contains predicted trajectories was fixed but the centre and scale are
    allowed to vary. However, the results of [10, 11] are limited to single system
    case, therefore, additional techniques are needed to generalise these results
    to distributed systems. Distributed MPC (DMPC) is a further development of MPC
    technique for large-scale engineering systems such as chemical plant [16], process
    control [17], motorcade [18], the computational complexity and information exchange
    rate among subsystems are reduced with DMPC compared with centralised MPC. Moreover,
    it is motivated to generalise a distributed system framework to large-scale systems
    with uncertainties, that is DSMPC or DRMPC. In [19], a novel form of DRMPC for
    multiple dynamically decoupled subsystems with disturbances was presented, and
    the coupling constraints were guaranteed to be satisfied. The results were further
    extended to a class of linear stochastic subsystems subject to additive disturbances
    and coupling probabilistic constraints in [20], and less conservative results
    were obtained. Moreover, in [17], a cooperative DSMPC algorithm for dynamic decoupled
    subsystems with unmeasurable states was presented. Although the network between
    subsystems was considered in [19–21], the networks-induced constraints such as
    time-varying delays and quantisation process were not taken into account. Since
    the subsystems are connected through networks, the time-varying delays it takes
    for the information transmission are inevitable. There have been many literature
    that focused on time-varying delay-induced problems, for instance, the stability
    of continuous-time positive systems with time-varying delays was considered in
    [22]. For a class of discrete uncertain systems with time-varying delays, input
    constraints and normbounded non-linear perturbations, an RMPC algorithm was proposed
    in [23] to compute the state feedback control law by minimising the upper bound
    of the cost function. However, the existing methods cannot be directly applied
    to distributed systems with coupling probabilistic constraints, hence, how to
    deal with time-varying delays in networked systems with probabilistic constraints
    is one of the motivations of this paper. In addition, another network-induced
    problem is network congestion, one of the methods to deal with this problem is
    the quantisation process. There are many kinds of quantisers, such as uniform
    scalar quantisers [24], logarithmic quantisers [25], hysteresis quantisers [26]
    and arbitrary region quantisers [27]. In this paper, a kind of arbitrary region
    quantisers is considered. This class of quantisers were used to obtain the effective
    values of the signals in communication channels [28, 29]. Based on the zoom strategy,
    sufficient conditions were given to ensure the stability of the closed-loop quantised
    networked control system. Therefore,the zoom quantisation strategy is considered
    in this paper to alleviate network congestion. Motivated by the aforementioned
    discussions, in this paper, we consider the DSMPC for networked systems with multiple
    dynamically decoupled subsystems subject to stochastic disturbances, coupling
    probabilistic constraints and network-induced constraints such as time-varying
    delays and quantisation processes. With the proposed Probabilistic Constraint
    Handling Strategy and DSMPC algorithm, the stochastic quadratic stability of the
    entire networked system can be guaranteed. The main contributions are summarised
    as follows. DSMPC for linear systems with network-induced imperfections is studied.
    Time-varying delays and quantisation are considered in this work while they were
    not considered in [20], since these imperfections introduce some difficulties
    for stability analysis and DSMPC design. Therefore, the obtained results in this
    paper are more practical. Though the network-induced imperfections such as time-delay
    and quantisation bring negative influences to the system performance, with the
    proposed DSMPC algorithm, the desired system performance can be guaranteed and
    is comparable to the results in [20]. Recursive feasibility of the optimisation
    problem, and quadratic stability of the overall system are guaranteed even in
    the presence of stochastic uncertainties, time-varying delays and quantisation.
    The rest of this paper is organised as follows. In Section 2, problem statement
    and some preliminaries are given. In Section 3, the main results including quantiser
    parameter design, probabilistic constraints handling strategy and recursive feasibility,
    optimisation problem formulation and distributed implementation algorithm and
    stability analysis are presented. A numerical example is presented to illustrate
    the validity of the proposed DSMPC algorithm in Section 4. Section 5 concludes

    In this section, we introduce the networked system subject to probabilistic constraints
    and stochastic disturbances, and then provide problem statement. The networked
    system configuration is given in Fig. 1. In this paper, we mainly consider the
    network between subsystem controllers, the network between subsystems is not considered.
    However, if each subsystem also communicates via a network, it is an interesting
    research topic and will make the DSMPC design be more difficult, we will consider
    this topic in our future work. Fig. 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Structure

    such that the exact values cannot present. Remark 1.The disturbances are unavoidable
    in engineering practice, and they can be induced by many factors such as variations
    of concentration, temperature, humidity etc. In this paper, we consider stochastic
    disturbances with a certain probability, which can be used to simulate the actual
    control process of engineering and has more practical significance. To proceed
    with, we need the following assumptions, which are quite standard. Assumption
    1.Each subsystem has a priori knowledge of model parameters related to all other
    subsystems. Such as system parameters , , , stable controller gain , constraint
    parameters , , , and probability distribution information of random disturbances
    . Assumption 2.Stochastic disturbances are independent and identically distributed
    for each subsystem p, the elements of have zero mean and the distribution function
    is assumed to be continuous. 2.2 Probabilistic constraints The output is given
    as follows: (3) Each subsystem p is subject to a local probabilistic constraint
    on an output which has the form (4) Also assume that there are coupled probabilistic
    constraints across multiple subsystems, and the coupled output has the form (5)
    Each subsystem p is subject to a coupled probabilistic constraint on a coupled
    output which has the form (6) The row vectors , fixed scalars and thresholds are
    all chosen by the designer in advance. The form of (6) is very general, which
    permits coupling to exist between any number of subsystems. And the case of hard
    constraints is treated simply by setting and in (4) and (6). Remark 2.With respect
    to the probabilistic constraint problem considered in this paper, multi-agent
    systems can be viewed as a practical example. Each agent is viewed as a subsystem
    in a distributed system, in which the actuator has a rectangular pressure vessels
    component. The mathematical model of the rectangular pressure vessels component
    is established by using the relevant mathematical theory and optimisation principle.
    The constraints that directly lead to the failure of the vessels are viewed as
    probability constraints, and there are networks between the multi-agent systems,
    such that, the sum of the constraints that directly lead to failure of the vessels
    are defined as the coupled probability constraints. Remark 3.Since has an effect
    on the system states and output, and the stochastic disturbance is subordinate
    to a certain probability distribution, the system output was related to the probability
    of the stochastic disturbance. 2.3 DSMPC controller The DSMPC controller at time
    k is designed as follows, which includes linear state feedback and a decision
    variable (7) where is a linear state feedback gain matrix such that is strictly
    stable, which is determined off-line. For a selected finite prediction horizons
    N, is the decision variable for and for . Remark 4.In this section, we define
    the input sequence by means of the idea of the dual-mode controller, that is,
    the first N steps of the input sequence are free, while the input in the subsequent
    infinite predictive time domain is just a state feedback law. 2.4 Communication
    channel In this paper, the channel received information from the other subsystems
    is defined as reception channel, and the channel sent information to the other
    subsystems is defined as sending channel. The time-varying delays in the reception
    channel at time k are defined as and the time-varying delays in the sending channel
    at time k are defined as . The upper bound of time-varying delays is less than
    prediction horizons N. Remark 5.The time-varying delays are inevitable in real
    networks, one of the advantages of this paper is that it is more practical compared
    with [20], though only the time-varying delays among controllers is considered.
    The case of time-varying delays existing among both the controllers and subsystems
    will be our further research topic. 2.5 Quantiser design Considering the large
    computational load of the model predictive control algorithm, it will also increase
    the network burden. Compared with [20, 21], this paper proposes a quantised strategy
    to deal with network data, which can make better use of network resources and
    ease the network burden. Therefore, it is more practical to consider the strategy
    of quantisation on the basis of [20, 21]. It is an effective way of using quantisation
    to improve network congestion. Quantisation reduces the burden of networks to
    a large extent. Quantisation is to take a reasonable value to accurate data, so
    there is a certain error between the quantised value and the exact value. In this
    paper, the quantiser is chosen as (8) where , . With rectangular quantisation
    area, is a piecewise constant valued function which is satisfied with the following
    two conditions: If , If . Obviously, with arbitrary shape quantisation region,
    uniform quantiser is also satisfied with the following two conditions: If , If
    , where M and represent saturation value and sensitivity of the quantiser, respectively.
    The quantisation of the state information transmitted to controllers is to save
    network resources. For space limitations, how to obtain the aforementioned conditions
    is not given here and can be referred to [28, 29], and the parameter matrix (see
    [28, 29]) will be presented in Theorem 1. Using the Zooming-out strategy in [28,
    29], we can get that quantiser (8) is not saturate. Furthermore, based on condition
    iii, there are (9) (10) where are the state quantisation error and the decision
    variable quantisation error, respectively. Before using the zoom policy, we denote
    as a quantisation period and , note that e is natural constant, when or , and
    when , when . According to the zoom-in strategy, the value of decreases monotonously
    with the raise of k when or . Therefore the quantisation error and are gradually
    reduced to 0 by the Zoom-in strategy. Remark 6.Some other quantisers (such as
    uniform quantisers, logarithmic quantisers etc.) that only consider quantitative
    data but cannot guarantee the stability of the designed quantiser itself. In contrast
    with these quantisers, based on the zoom strategy, sufficient conditions are given
    to ensure the stability of the quantiser itself and the zoom quantiser can make
    better use of network resources and reduce the network burden. Therefore, the
    zoom quantiser is more practical than other types of quantisers. The following
    definitions are given to demonstrate coupled relationships in subsystems. Definition
    1.A set composed of all subsystems associated with a coupled constraint c is defined
    as A set composed of all coupled constraints associated with subsystem p is shown
    as A set composed of all subsystems coupled with the subsystem p is given as Definition
    2.If the entire closed-loop control system as shown in Fig. 1 satisfies the following
    condition: (11) with , are two known weight matrices and a non-zero limit value
    , then the entire closed-loop control system is quadratically stable. We are now
    in a position to address the problem considered in this paper. Consider the networked
    systems configuration as shown in Fig. 1, the objective is to design the decision
    variable via solving the optimisation problem (8), such that the networked system
    is quadratic stability with guaranteed probabilistic constraints. 3 Main results
    In this section, DSMPC is proposed for the networked system. Moreover, recursive
    feasibility and globally quadratic stability are presented for the system. 3.1
    Quantiser parameter design The main purpose of this subsection is to design the
    important parameters of the quantiser, and the parameter matrix is obtained by
    solving the linear matrix inequality. Theorem 1.Consider the linear subsystem
    (1) and the DSMPC controller (7). If there is a matrix such that the following
    matrix inequality holds: (12) where , then, . Proof.The proof is similar to the
    proof of Theorem 1 in [28], and it omitted here due to space limitation. □ Remark
    7.Adding quantiser to the subsystem to alleviate the network burden is one of
    the main contributions of this paper. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure that
    the quantiser is stable. Because as long as we get the value of matrix through
    linear matrix inequality (12), then we can guarantee that the quantiser is stable
    [28]. 3.2 Probabilistic constraints handling strategy and recursive feasibility
    The focus of this paper is to deal with probabilistic constraints, that is, to
    transform the uncertain probabilistic constraints into deterministic probability
    constraints. The following theorem presents the handing strategy of probabilistic
    constraints and can guarantee the feasibility of the optimisation problem defined
    in the next subsection. Theorem 2.When the subsystem updates, if the decision
    variable sequence satisfies the following recursive feasible constraint conditions
    for , and , the probabilistic constraint conditions (4) and (6) can be guaranteed
    (13) (14) where the matrix S is a shift matrix and the variable will be defined
    in the following proof. Note that the values of and , are not dependent on the
    decision variable sequence . Therefore they appear as fixed values in (14), denoted
    by . The optimising subsystem p needs to get the values of and for all subsystems
    ahead of time. Moreover, and are defined as the maximum values of the i th columns
    of the matrices and , respectively. The matrices and are given as where Furthermore,
    if conditions (13) and (14) are feasible at time k, then (13) and (14) will be
    feasible at the times . Proof.See Appendix 1. □ 3.3 Optimisation problem formulation
    and distributed implementation algorithm For , suppose that and are known for
    subsystem p, respectively. The local optimisation problem subjects to probabilistic
    constraints (13), (14) is formulated as (15) where and subject to , where the
    inner approximation is obtained from the result in [30]. The optimisation problem
    subjects to the constraints (4) and (6), where with and are two known weight matrices.
    Take a decision variable sequence as When there exists time-varying delays in
    either reception channel or sending channel, a feasible decision variable sequence
    will be applied to the actuator, which is the tails of their previous decision
    variable sequence augmented with . A decision variable set is shown as follows:
    A non-zero limit value is used to guarantee that the cost is finite over an infinite
    horizon, which can be derived using results in [31]. Note that the cost function
    in (15) is expressed as a quadratic function depending on the decision variables
    . Moreover, conditions (13), (14) are affine functions which indicate that the
    terminal set is a polyhedron. Therefore, the local optimisation problem can be
    converted into a quadratic programming problem and a new algorithm is proposed
    to solve this quadratic programming problem. The proposed DSMPC algorithm is presented
    as follows. Remark 8.Denote as the time frequency function, as the auxiliary complexity
    function, as the time complexity function. From Algorithm 1 (see Fig. 2), we can
    see that the function for the offline step, for (1)–(3) of the online step, and
    for (4) of the online step. Thus, the total complexity function for online step
    is . By ignoring the coefficient of the highest power and the constant term, we
    can get the total complexity of Algorithm 1 (Fig. 2) is , it can be seen that
    the proposed algorithm is not too complex to be implemented in practice. Fig.
    2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Algorithm 1 DSMPC algorithm 3.4 Stability analysis
    Recursive feasibility of subsequent optimisation problem is guaranteed by Theorem
    2. In this subsection, the overall closed-loop stability of the entire system
    is verified by the following theorem. Theorem 3.If there exists a feasible solution
    for the initial optimisation problem for each subsystem . The optimisation problem
    is feasible for each subsystem for based on Algorithm 1 (Fig. 2). Moreover, the
    probabilistic constraints (4) and (6) are guaranteed for subsystem p. Furthermore,
    for any choice of update sequences, the overall closed-loop system satisfies the
    quadratic stability condition (11) in Definition 2, therefore, the entire closed-loop
    system is quadratically stable. Proof.See Appendix 1. □ 4 Numerical example In
    this section, a numerical example is provided to show the effectiveness of the
    proposed results. In particular, consider three identical subsystems with the
    system matrices described as There are four probabilistic constraints, including
    three local probabilistic constraints and a state-coupled probabilistic constraint.
    The constraint parameters are given as follows , , , , , , and , , . Each subsystem
    subjects to a series of stochastic disturbances, and the disturbances are independent
    and identical. Each element is truncated from a Gaussian distribution with zero
    mean and variance and satisfies for . The feedback gain is taken as , which is
    the LQ-optimal gain for the given subsystem model. The prediction horizons N and
    are selected as and , respectively. Optimisation update sequence uses simple sequential
    optimisation sequence . The objective is to drive system state to converge to
    a small neighbourhood of origin. The weight matrices Q and R in cost function
    are taken as and . The parameters of the time-varying delays and the quantiser
    are given in the following. The network-induced time-varying delays and are shown
    in Figs. 3 and 4 with the upper bound . Fig. 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint

    8 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint in the ‘Zoom’ strategy To verify the effectiveness
    of the proposed DSMPC algorithm, classical unconstrained optimal control is used
    for comparison. 5000 times of Monte Carlo simulations are carried out under the
    same initial condition , and . Figs. 9 and 10 show the closed-loop trajectories
    of each subsystem state and coupling state under two control strategies, respectively
    (for brevity, only 50 simulation results are given in the graph). Fig. 9 Open

    of the sum of states with Algorithm 1 (Fig. 2) and unconstrained optimal control
    In Fig. 9, CSubsystems 1–3 denote the state trajectories of subsystems based on
    Algorithm 1 (Fig. 2) and NSubsystems 1–3 denote the state trajectories of subsystems
    based on unconstrained optimal control. Note that the black straight line represents
    the local constraint of subsystems 1–3. Obviously, the state trajectories based
    on Algorithm 1 (Fig. 2) satisfy the local constraint under a certain probability,
    but the state trajectories based on unconstrained optimal control violate the
    local constraint at the beginning stage. In Fig. 10, CCoupling state represents
    the coupling state trajectory of subsystems based on Algorithm 1 (Fig. 2) and
    NCoupling state represents the coupling state trajectory of subsystems based on
    unconstrained optimal control. The black dashed line represents the coupling constraint
    of the homogeneous subsystems. According to Fig. 10, the coupling state trajectory
    based on Algorithm 1 (Fig. 2) satisfies the coupling constraint with a certain
    probability. However, the coupling state trajectory based on unconstrained optimal
    control violates the coupling constraint from the beginning. In contrast with
    [20], the advantages of the proposed algorithm in this paper are that both time-varying
    delays and quantisation effects are considered, thus, the designed algorithm in
    this paper is more practicable and appropriate. To clearly show the advantages
    of the proposed algorithm, we consider a networked system with time-varying delays
    and quantisation, and both the algorithm in [20] and the proposed algorithm in
    this paper are applied to this system. The simulation results with the algorithm
    in [20] is presented in Figs. 11 and 12, where it is shown that the system states
    have large fluctuations in the presence of time-varying delays and quantisation
    processes, thus, it can be seen that the algorithm in [20] is not appropriate
    for networked systems with network-induced constraints. By contrast, the proposed
    algorithm in this paper can not only deal with the coupling constraints but also
    lead to so small system states fluctuations under network-induced constraints.
    Large fluctuations bring difficulties for implementation in physical, therefore,
    by comparison, it is shown that the proposed algorithm in this paper is more practical
    than the algorithm in [20]. Fig. 11 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Closed-loop

    of time-varying delays Fig. 12 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Evolution of the
    sum of states with Algorithm 1 in [20] in the presence of time-varying delays
    In this example, the performance index is taken as the weighted sum of local costs
    for each subsystem during the entire simulation period. The average cumulative
    cost of 5000 simulations with Algorithm 1 (Fig. 2) is 767.88, the average cumulative
    cost of 5000 simulations with unconstraint optimal control is 648.07. The unconstrained
    optimal control achieves a lower value of the average cost cumulative at the expense
    of violating the probabilistic constraints. However, due to the constraints in
    practice are inevitable, it is concluded that the Algorithm 1 (Fig. 2) can not
    only obey the constraints but also achieves almost the same performance as unconstrained
    optimal control. Based on the above analysis and compared with [20], it has been
    shown that the proposed algorithm is effective for systems with time-varying delays
    and quantisation processes. 5 Conclusion In this paper, a DSMPC algorithm has
    been proposed for a class of networked subsystems with time-varying delays and
    quantisation processes. The quantisation method has been used to alleviate network
    congestion. Furthermore, recursive feasibility of the optimisation problem has
    been guaranteed and quadratic stability of the closed system has also been ensured.
    Finally, a numerical example has been given to illustrate the validity of the
    proposed DSMPC algorithm. In our future work, we will further consider the network
    between subsystems in addition to the network between controllers, and applying
    the proposed DSMPC algorithm to multi-agent systems is also an interesting research
    topic. 7 Appendix 7.1 Proof of Theorem 2 For a subsystem , the state trajectories
    predicted at time k are decomposed into two components, the nominal one and the
    uncertain one , which are formulated as (17) (18) (19) where and initial conditions
    for are and (since the state at time k is known). An output predicted at time
    k is given as Because is defined as the maximum of the i th column of matrix ,
    constraint (13) is equivalent to constraint . By (5), there exists the coupling
    output Let (20) (21) where and are the minimum values that satisfy (20) and (21).
    Then it is obtained that (22) (23) From (20)–(23), it is implied that the probabilistic
    constraints (4) and (6) are guaranteed for the entire prediction horizons at time
    k. Note that there is no guarantee for the decision variable sequence at time
    , to satisfy conditions (22) and (23) when the decision variable sequence satisfy
    (22) and (23) at time k. There are two cases of the predictive state at time .
    When the subsystem p is not updating at time k, the predicted state is shown as
    (24) (25) (26) where (27) (28) When the subsystem p is updating at time k, the
    state predicted at time is represented as (29) Therefore, when the subsystem p
    is updating, the predicted output is obtained (30) Moreover, the sum of coupling
    output predicted at time is expressed as (31) where is known as the worst-case
    value of . In addition, if the stochastic disturbances are assumed to have bound,
    then it is not difficult to obtain that the worst case of is a limited value.
    Let and where and are two maximum element values of the i th column for the two
    matrices and , respectively. If and are defined as the i th element of the first
    row of matrices and , then constraints (13) and (14) are equivalent to constraints
    (22) and (23), so is the feasible solution at time k. At updating time , condition
    (13) and (14) are equivalent to conditions (22) and (23) for subsystem p, respectively.
    At time , in (30) and (31) is replaced by the maximum value corresponding to all
    possible values of the stochastic disturbances . Then the i th elements of the
    second row in matrices and are obtained. Therefore, feasibility of at time is
    guaranteed. Similarly, feasibility of at time is ensured by the worst value of
    in (30) and (31). If and are chosen according to Theorem 2, then conditions (13)
    and (14) guarantee that there exist feasible solutions for the optimisation problem
    (15) at any time. Moreover considering quantisation process, the constraints (13)
    and (14) are naturally obtained by replacing and with and , respectively. This
    completes the proof. 7.2 Proof of Theorem 3 To consider closed-loop stability,
    the global cost is defined as the summation of the local cost of each subsystem
    . Assume that is a feasible solution at time k and the corresponding local cost
    is for subsystem . By Algorithm 1 (Fig. 2), the optimising subsystem obtains its
    optimal solution by solving at time . At the same time, other subsystems adopt
    their respective candidate solutions , and is the last updated time. Thus, the
    global cost at time is given as (32) Taking expectation on both sides of (32),
    it follows that: (33) where is the global cost that each subsystem adopts their
    respective candidate plans . Since is a known feasible solution at time for subsystem
    , therefore, according to the optimisation principle, the cost associated with
    is an upper-bound of the optimal cost. There exists (34) By inequality (34), one
    has that (35) Since is a feasible solution at time , it can be inferred from (15)
    that (36) Summing (36) over and taking expectation on both sides, there exists
    (37) According to equality (37), inequality (35) can be rewritten as (38) Summing
    (38) over , there exists (39) Because the finite is bounded and can be expressed
    as a quadratic function and function exists the lower bound, therefore inequality
    (39) shows that the quadratic stability condition (11) holds, which completes
    the proof. 6 References Citing Literature Volume14, Issue3 February 2020 Pages

  explanation: This paper's focus is on exploring closed-loop control within autonomous
    irrigation systems. Closed-loop control systems are generally characterized by
    a feedback mechanism that monitors and adjusts the output based on the input.
    In this paper, the mechanism is the sensor feedback that is used to determine
    the flow rate to each plant. This adjustment is made based on soil moisture readings
    taken by sensors attached to the plants themselves, which allows for the irrigation
    system to be far more precise in its delivery.
  extract_1: In this paper, an algorithm based on closed-loop control is implemented
    to monitor soil moisture and apply water only when the soil moisture is below
    a certain threshold.
  extract_2: The proposed system is a closed-loop control system that uses feedback
    from soil moisture sensors to adjust the amount of water applied to each plant.
    This system is more efficient than traditional irrigation systems, which apply
    water on a fixed schedule regardless of the soil moisture level.

    Abstract: The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) refers to the employment of
    the Internet of Things

    in industrial management, where a substantial number of machines and devices are
    linked and

    synchronized with the help of software programs and third platforms to improve
    the overall pro-

    ductivity. The acquisition of the industrial IoT provides beneﬁts that range from
    automation and

    optimization to eliminating manual processes and improving overall efﬁciencies,
    but security remains

    to be forethought. The absence of reliable security mechanisms and the magnitude
    of security features

    are signiﬁcant obstacles to enhancing IIoT security. Over the last few years,
    alarming attacks have

    been witnessed utilizing the vulnerabilities of the IIoT network devices. Moreover,
    the attackers can

    also sink deep into the network by using the relationships amidst the vulnerabilities.
    Such network

    security threats cause industries and businesses to suffer ﬁnancial losses, reputational
    damage, and

    theft of important information. This paper proposes an SDN-based framework using
    machine learn-

    ing techniques for intrusion detection in an industrial IoT environment. SDN is
    an approach that

    enables the network to be centrally and intelligently controlled through software
    applications. In

    our framework, the SDN controller employs a machine-learning algorithm to monitor
    the behavior

    of industrial IoT devices and networks by analyzing trafﬁc ﬂow data and ultimately
    determining

    the ﬂow rules for SDN switches. We use SVM and Decision Tree classiﬁcation models
    to analyze

    our framework’s network intrusion and attack detection performance. The results
    indicate that the

    proposed framework can detect attacks in industrial IoT networks and devices with
    an accuracy

    of 99.7%.

    Keywords: industrial internet of things (IIoT); software-deﬁned network; intrusion

    1. Introduction

    For a long time, precarious infrastructures, such as communication networks, electric

    systems, and industrial systems, have customarily worked in segregation from extrinsic

    networks, such as the Internet. However, advanced technologies, such as artiﬁcial
    intelli-

    gence and software-deﬁned networking, are progressively being combined in such
    rigid

    environments to provide further beneﬁts, such as increased ﬂexibility and improved
    quality.

    The deﬁnition of the SDN is as follows: “In the SDN architecture, the control
    plane and

    data plane are decoupled, network intelligence and state are logically centralized,
    and

    the underlying network infrastructure is abstracted from the applications” [1].
    The SDN

    centralizes the switch control functions into an SDN controller. The switches
    then function

    as packet-processing devices and carry out the commands from the SDN controller
    [2].

    The SDN controllers can use machine learning and deep learning techniques to improve

    network security and monitoring [3]. The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)
    is another

    such technology. The typical Internet of Things consists of devices from simple
    sensors

    to smartphones and wearable ones that are connected. Combining these interconnected

    devices with automated systems makes it possible to collect information, analyze
    it, and

    create an action to assist someone with a speciﬁc task or learn from the process.
    In reality,

    it ranges from smart mirrors to beacons in stores and beyond. The Industrial Internet
    of

    Things is an innovative attempt to set up a smart manufacturing environment by
    employing

    the beneﬁts of the Internet of Things in industrial process management. Industrial
    IoT

    focuses on machine-to-machine (M2M) communications, machine learning, and big
    data

    to enable enterprises and industries to have better reliability and efﬁciency
    in their opera-

    tions. Leveraging the industrial IoT is revolutionizing factory and industrial
    segmentation

    by presenting its eminence. The Industrial Internet of Things is swiftly progressing
    and

    comprises several services and industries, as shown in Figure 1. In the hospitality
    industry,

    the IoT can be helpful in understanding guests’ context and predicting their needs
    through

    intelligence and embedded sensors. There are endless possibilities with the IoT
    in the

    healthcare sector. The telemedicine system is based on the IoT. It is a practice
    of providing

    medical care by using data communications and interactive audiovisuals. Educational

    institutions are also taking advantage of various IoT applications. For instance,
    the IoT is

    being used in e-learning, m-learning, and u-learning.

    Figure 1. IoT in different sectors.

    The ﬁnancial services sector also seems to be taking up the IoT. Insurance companies

    use telematics applications to foretell and assess the possible risks that might
    result in

    a claim from the client. Energy companies use smart grids to capture analytics,
    improve

    security, and allow for rapid restoration when power failures occur. The IoT is
    changing

    how the retail market works. Automated checkouts are installed on the front side
    of the

    stores. This solution allows workers to focus on business opportunities and needs
    instead

    of spending time as a cashier. One of the ﬁnest examples of industries that are
    adopting IoT

    applications is the manufacturing industry. The manufacturers are using the IoT
    to keep

    track of production ﬂow during the production process. Through the data gathered
    from

    IoT devices, manufacturers can measure the quality of items.

    The automated industry relies on the Industrial Control System (ICS). The ICS
    consists

    of various types of controllers that are used to control the industrial plants
    and monitor

    Sustainability 2023, 15, 9001

    3 of 18

    their performance to guarantee their accurate operations [4,5]. There are various
    types of

    ICSs, such as distributed control systems (DCS), programmable logic controllers
    (PLC),

    supervisory control, and data acquisition systems (SCADA). Since the introduction
    of

    the IoT in industrial systems, they have changed into open architecture environments.

    As a result, industrial control systems have become vulnerable to security threats
    and

    attacks. A survey conducted by the UK Government has estimated that the average
    cost

    of a cyber-security breach ranges from £75,000 to £311,000 for small and medium-sized

    enterprises (SMEs) and from £1.46m to £3.14m for larger organizations. The Stuxnet
    attack

    against a nuclear power plant in Iran in 2010 is one of the most prominent cyber
    attacks.

    An SQL injection attack through a Trojan called the Night Dragon was conducted
    in 2010

    to target oil companies globally. In 2013, the energy companies of North America
    were

    targeted by a Trojan called Dragonﬂy, and, in 2014, by Havex [6]. Some of the
    signiﬁcant

    cyber incidents in ICSs are mentioned in Table 1.

    Table 1. Major ICS cyber-incidents [7].

    The Denial of Service (DoS) attacks and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) at-

    tacks are the most prominent attacks that prevent legitimate users from accessing
    services

    for which they have paid. These types of attacks have become serious security
    risks for

    computer networks, causing a drop in network performance by consuming resources

    and deactivating services [8]. The DoS/DDoS also affects industrial IoT networks
    and

    devices [9–11]. Jamming attacks are also carried out against industrial IoT devices
    and

    networks. In this attack, fake signals are sent to interrupt proceeding radio
    transmissions

    of the IoT devices, and it further depletes the energy, bandwidth, CPUs, and sensors
    or

    memory resources of the IoT devices during failed communication attempts [12–14].
    Thus,

    the security of industrial IoT devices and networks is one of the most critical
    concerns for

    researchers nowadays. There are various challenges with the implementation of
    security

    within industrial IoT networks and devices. Industrial IoT systems are heterogeneous

    systems containing several types of devices, types of data being shared and transferred,

    methods of communication, different resource levels of the devices, and system
    conﬁgura-

    tions. Each of these elements adds up to the challenges of IoT security. Secondly,
    billions of

    devices are connected and provide a vast area of research to focus on when considering

    resiliency, nominal function, and security.

    Sustainability 2023, 15, 9001

    4 of 18

    Previously, the ICSs were autonomous systems, and they were isolated from the
    world.

    Thus, they were not open to attacks. However, the increase in connectivity of
    ICSs with

    the Internet for industrial management and communication for information transmission

    has made these systems more vulnerable to cyberattacks and anomalies. Thus, security

    has become a signiﬁcant concern in industrial IoT systems because of their sensitive
    nature.

    The reliability, safety, and availability of industrial IoT systems are compromised
    by the

    lack of security parameters in the communication protocols.

    1.1. Problem Statement

    The IIoT makes use of the IoT technology in ICSs, i.e., industrial control systems.
    Since

    ICSs perform operations continuously, they also produce a large amount of data.
    These

    systems have become vulnerable to network attacks and other malicious attacks
    due to

    internet connectivity. Therefore, it is not possible to ensure the authenticity
    of the data.

    Thus, ensuring the security of IIoT devices and the IIoT network is a signiﬁcant
    problem

    that needs to be solved.

    1.2. Limitations of Existing Work

    Various intrusion detection and classiﬁcation schemes employing artiﬁcial intelligence

    have been studied in the literature [15]. Most of the security frameworks developed
    to

    secure industrial IoT networks had a high false alarm rate. Furthermore, they
    were unable

    to detect unknown attacks on the network. Hence, they were not very effective
    in securing

    industrial IoT networks against network attacks, resulting in costly damages to
    industrial

    IoT networks, data losses, and loss of revenue. Thus, we used machine learning
    algorithms

    and SDN technology in our framework for the effective detection of malicious attacks,

    network intrusion, and the identiﬁcation of abnormal behavior in industrial IoT
    networks

    and devices.

    1.3. Contributions of this Paper

    The major contributions of our paper are manifold:

    1.

    In this paper, a discussion on cyber attacks and security threats to the industrial
    IoT

    environment is given.

    2.

    We propose an SDN-based security framework to detect industrial IoT network

    intrusion by analyzing trafﬁc ﬂow data.

    3.

    The main objective of our work is to protect industrial IoT devices and networks

    against malicious attacks and security threats. For that purpose, we consider
    different

    attacks on industrial IoT environments, such as DoS/DDoS attacks, jamming attacks,

    and man-in-the-middle attacks.

    4.

    We use machine learning algorithms, i.e., SVM and Decision Tree on an SDN controller,

    for early intrusion detection within a network or device of the industrial IoT
    and

    determine the ﬂow rules for the SDN switches based on analyzed data.

    5.

    We evaluate the proposed SDN-based security framework using the NSL-KDD intru-

    sion detection dataset.

    6.

    The evaluation results show that the proposed framework provides high efﬁciency
    of

    security and can detect intrusion and malicious attacks in industrial IoT networks.

    2. Literature Review

    Several studies have been conducted to analyze the security vulnerabilities in
    IIoT

    systems. Various challenges prevent securing the IIoT and ensuring end-to-end
    security

    in the IIoT environment. In this section, we present brief descriptions of the
    various

    types of research conducted for the IIoT environment. These types of research
    mainly

    focus on the attacks on the IIoT environment and several other threats to the
    IIoT systems.

    George et al. [16] proposed a graph-based framework to represent the vulnerability
    re-

    lationship in the IIoT network. It also helps in the risk assessment of the IIoT
    network.

    They also proposed various risk mitigation strategies for improving IIoT network
    security.

    Sustainability 2023, 15, 9001

    5 of 18

    Furthermore, they discussed methods to identify hot spots in the IIoT networks.
    The

    proposed system performance is evaluated by simulating with graphs of varying
    sizes and

    structures. Rubio et al. [17] presented the analysis of applying Opinion Dynamics
    in the

    IIoT environment. They addressed how the Opinion Dynamics algorithm can improve

    attack traceability in the IIoT environment. The proposed system is evaluated
    through

    a case study, and the results demonstrate the feasibility of the approach in IIoT
    infras-

    tructures. AL-Hawawreh et al. [18] proposed a deep learning-based model that can
    learn

    using the information gathered from TCP/IP packets for anomaly detection in IICSs.
    The

    authors developed the model by a continuous training process that is carried out
    using

    a deep auto-encoder and a deep feed-forward neural network framework evaluated
    using

    NSL-KDD and UNSW-NB15.

    Samsonov et al. [19] presented various approaches to provide security in IIoT
    environ-

    ments. They employed edge and fog computing technologies, various data transmission

    technologies, cryptographic techniques, IIoT device protection, and blockchain
    technology

    to secure IIoT systems. However, they have not discussed the system reconﬁguration

    for new tasks, the motive for choosing security mechanisms, and shared IIoT devices

    management. Teochew [20] addressed various security problems in the IIoT. The
    author

    also discussed various attacks on different IIoT architecture layers, attacks
    based on ap-

    plication scenarios, and third-party hardware/software-based attacks. Furthermore,
    the

    recommendations for approaching these security challenges are discussed.

    Esfahani et al. [21] proposed a hash and OR operation-based lightweight authentica-

    tion mechanism for M2M communication in an IIoT environment. The authors claim
    that

    the proposed system has a low computational cost, storage, and communication overhead

    while conﬁdentiality, authentication, and session key agreement are achieved.
    Moreover,

    the proposed system also resists speciﬁc security attacks, i.e., man-in-the-middle
    attacks,

    modiﬁcation attacks, replay attacks, and impersonation attacks. Wing et al. [22]
    proposed

    a blockchain-based solution to secure the IIoT through its security technology
    and tools.

    They further gave recommendations to guide future blockchain developers and researchers.

    Chen et al. [23] analyzed the security threats in IIoT systems and designed a
    protection

    framework for securing IIoT systems. The author analyzed the security threats
    to the IIoT

    through the communication protocols used and the main functionalities for each
    level of

    typical IIoT architecture. They identiﬁed the concealed dangers in the data processing

    layer, data transmission layer, and data acquisition layer. The proposed security
    framework

    provides protection measures against security threats in these layers. Choo et
    al. [24]

    presented various performances, privacy, and security-related issues of the IIoT.
    They

    addressed existing cryptographic solutions presented in 21 papers. Lastly, they
    presented

    various potential research agendas. Sinai et al. [25] presented the concept of
    the IoT, IIoT,

    and Industry 4.0. They addressed various opportunities and challenges associated
    with

    these systems. The work also focuses on the security challenges of IIoT systems
    that

    originate from the high sensitivity of managed information. Bakhshi et al. [26]
    addressed

    various security issues and threats in the IIoT. They focused mainly on the security
    threats

    on a cloud-side layer, consisting of abstraction levels and data accumulation,
    of the IoT.

    The authors referred to the Cisco and Microsoft Azure IoT architectures as the
    reference

    models. Further, they subdivided the threats based on security attacks and vulnerabilities.

    Kwon et al. [27] analyzed the security issues of the provisioning process in the
    IWSN by

    investigating the necessary ISN standards, i.e., WirelessHART, ISA 100.11.A, and
    Zigbee,

    an ISA 100.11a-certiﬁed device, and various provisioning process-related research
    works.

    They tested and analyzed the provisioning process using ISA 100.11a to verify
    its security

    issues. Lastly, they discussed the future research direction on providing security
    for the

    IWSN in the IIoT age. The summary of the techniques presented above is listed
    in Table 2.

    Numerous studies have been proposed for the detection of malicious trafﬁc and
    attacks

    in the industrial IoT. From the studies discussed above, it is noticed that machine
    learning

    algorithms could improve network security in the IIoT environment. Moreover, it
    is also

    observed that the models for securing IIoT networks are still under development.
    For this

    Sustainability 2023, 15, 9001

    6 of 18

    purpose, we combined SDN technology and machine learning algorithms for intrusion

    detection in IIoT networks.

    3. IoT, Industrial IoT, and Industry 4.0

    3.1. IoT

    The IoT refers to a system of billions of interrelated physical devices, i.e.,
    computing

    devices, digital and mechanical machines, animals, people, or objects connected
    to the

    Internet, and can transfer and share data over the Internet.

    Layers of IoT

    The essential IoT layers act as the backbone of IoT systems. These layers can
    form

    the basis of the development of effective IoT multilayered architecture. These
    layers are

    discussed below and summarized in Table 3.

    Perception Layer: This is the physical layer that consists of sensors, actuators,
    devices,

    and machines. Sensors, i.e., gauges, meters, and probes, sense and gather information

    about the industrial IoT environment. The actuators used in lasers, motor controllers,

    and robotic arms translate electrical signals from IoT systems into physical actions.

    •

    Transport Layer: This layer transports the sensor data between the perception
    layer

    and processing layer using technologies, such as WiFi, LPWAN, Ethernet, and ZigBee.

    Sustainability 2023, 15, 9001

    7 of 18

    •

    Processing Layer: This layer is also called the middleware layer. The processing
    layer

    is responsible for collecting information from the transport layer and performing

    processing on it [28].

    •

    Application Layer: The application layer is responsible for interacting with end-users

    directly. It consists of various applications, such as mobile apps, device monitoring

    software, business intelligence services, etc. All the applications have their
    application

    layer protocols.

    There are some additional layers in IoT systems to cater to the business needs
    of IoT

    systems. These layers are described below:

    •

    Edge Layer: This performs the preprocessing of data close to the edge. It occurs
    on

    local servers, gateways, and other edge nodes across the network.

    •

    Business Layer: The business layer is the layer on which businesses, based on
    collected

    data, can make decisions.

    •

    Security Layer: The security layer covers all the IoT layers mentioned above.
    It

    includes device security, connection security, and cloud security.

    3.2. Industrial IoT

    The industrial IoT refers to the utilization of the IoT in the industrial sector
    and

    business settings. The industrial IoT is the intersection of operational technology
    (OT)

    and information technology (IT). An advance notiﬁcation is generated from a machine

    about an approaching breakdown; the cloud-based intelligent factory ﬂoors obtain
    the

    status of assembly-line production or the progress of raw materials in real time.
    These are

    examples of how future industries and factories will work. Industrial Control
    System: An

    industrial control system refers to hardware devices and software integration
    that support

    and monitor critical infrastructures. It includes a programmable logic controller
    (PLC),

    a remote terminal unit (RTU), an intelligent electronic device (IED), a control
    server, a

    distributed control system (DCS), supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA),
    and

    sensors [29].

    Components of Industrial IoT

    The components of the industrial IoT can vary concerning the application. However,

    generally, they are categorized into three areas discussed below and shown in
    Figure 2.

    Figure 2. Components of industrial IoT.

    •

    Front-End Edge Devices: Front-end edge devices, i.e., sensors or control devices,
    are

    responsible for data collection and acting on the data. This data can be a temperature

    reading, accelerometer reading, or video feed. The sensors/devices can be used

    as individual units or multiple sensors bundled together, and the sensors can
    be

    embedded into devices that perform more tasks than just sensing things.

    •

    Connectivity Technology: Once the data is collected, the next step is to send
    the data

    to the cloud. Similarly, the cloud sends back commands to the industrial IoT system.

    Industrial IoT systems rely majorly on wireless technology, including Bluetooth,
    Mesh

    Networks, WiFi, and LPWAN.

    Sustainability 2023, 15, 9001

    8 of 18

    •

    Industrial IoT Platform Data Analysis: The industrial IoT system contains industrial

    IoT software for the analysis of acquired and transmitted data. The industrial
    IoT

    software can also make decisions and push commands back to the controls at the
    edge.

    3.3. Industry 4.0

    Industry 4.0 is the term often used for the fourth industrial revolution. Industry
    4.0,

    which includes the industrial IoT and smart manufacturing, combines physical production

    and operations with smart digital technologies, big data, and machine learning
    to build

    a more complete and well-connected environment for organizations focused on supply

    chain management and manufacturing. It is deﬁned as the current trend of data
    exchange

    and automation in manufacturing technologies, including the Internet of Things,
    cyber-

    physical systems, cognitive computing, cloud computing, and creating a smart industry
    or

    factory. Industry 4.0 is based on the cyber-physical system, i.e., intelligent
    machines. These

    systems use modern control systems with software systems embedded and connected
    to

    the IoT through Internet addresses. In this way, production and products get connected
    to

    the network and can communicate, enabling value creation, real-time optimization,
    and

    new ways of production. The objective is to monitor the processes and assets in
    real time,

    enabling processes to make autonomous decisions and fulﬁll customer needs. Industry
    4.0

    is characterized in the following way:

    •

    Provides more automation compared to the third industrial revolution;

    •

    Shifting from centralized industrial control systems to systems where intelligent

    products deﬁne the production steps;

    •

    Bridging the gap between the digital and physical world using cyber-physical systems;

    •

    Customization or personalization of products;

    •

    Closed-loop control systems and data models.

    4. Proposed Methodology

    In this section, we propose an SDN-based model for attack detection in an industrial

    IoT environment. The proposed framework comprises three components, i.e., industrial

    IoT devices, a centralized SDN controller, and SDN-enabled switches, as shown
    in Figure 3:

    Figure 3. SDN-Based Model for Industrial IoT Anomaly Detection.

    •

    The industrial IoT device is any IoT-enabled device operating in the industry.
    Indus-

    trial IoT devices may include drilling gears, green energy devices, smart meters,
    smart

    irrigation devices, smart frost systems, smart assembly lines, and various sensors.
    All

    of these devices are connected to the allocated SDN-enabled switch.

    •

    Each industry is assigned an SDN switch to connect its devices. The switch is
    SDN-

    enabled and security policies are installed within it. The SDN-enabled switches

    Sustainability 2023, 15, 9001

    9 of 18

    monitor the trafﬁc ﬂow in industrial IoT devices and provide trafﬁc data to the

    SDN controller.

    •

    The industrial IoT devices are connected to the SDN switches and these switches
    are

    connected to the SDN controller. The machine learning algorithm is applied to
    the

    SDN controller to detect anomalous trafﬁc and the abnormal behavior of the trafﬁc

    ﬂow. As a result, the ﬂow rules are deﬁned for the switches.

    The industrial IoT devices working in the same industry are connected to the SDN-

    enabled switch. The SDN-enabled switches provide the trafﬁc ﬂow data to the SDN

    controller, responsible for determining whether the trafﬁc ﬂow is normal or anomalous.

    Based on the analyzed data, it determines the ﬂow rules for the SDN-enabled switches.

    Based on these rules, the SDN-enabled switches perform various operations on the
    trafﬁc

    ﬂow, such as complete ﬂow blocking, partial ﬂow blocking, and blacklisting the
    attack

    source. For anomaly detection, a machine learning algorithm is applied to an SDN
    controller.

    Machine learning techniques can aid in developing security policies for SDN controllers
    by

    accurately predicting potential susceptible hosts [30].

    Dataset: We evaluate the performance of the framework using the NSL-KDD dataset,

    which is used for network intrusion detection. The reasonable number of test and
    train

    set records makes this dataset run experiments affordably on a complete set instead
    of

    selecting a small portion of the dataset randomly. Each record contains 41 attributes
    that

    describe various aspects of the ﬂow and are labeled as either an attack type or
    normal.

    The 42nd attribute contains information on the various ﬁve kinds of network connection

    vectors, which are divided into one normal class and four attack classes. The
    NSL-KDD

    dataset has the following advantages:

    •

    The train set contains no duplicated records, therefore, the classiﬁer will not
    provide

    any biased outputs.

    •

    There are no duplicate records in the test set, resulting in higher reduction
    rates.

    In this dataset, there are 22 different types of attacks classiﬁed into four major
    types

    of attacks [31]. The four attack types are classiﬁed as DoS, R2L, Probe, and U2R.
    These

    attacks are shown in Table 4.

    Table 4. Attacks in NSL-KDD [31].

    Data Preprocessing: In data preprocessing, feature selection is done to select
    the subset

    of the most relevant features. For feature selection, we have used a correlation-based
    feature

    selection (CFS) algorithm. Correlation is a measurement of the linear relationship
    between

    two or more variables. The reason for using CFS for feature selection is that
    useful variables

    have a strong correlation with the target. The variables should also be uncorrelated
    with

    one another but correlated with the target. We can predict one variable based
    on the other

    if the two are correlated. As a result, if there is a correlation between two
    features, the

    model only requires one because the second does not provide any new information.
    Using

    the CFS algorithm, 23 uncorrelated features were selected for prediction. Support
    Vector

    Machine(SVM): Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised learning technique
    used for

    the regression and classiﬁcation of problems. The kernels and algorithms in SVM
    are used

    to analyze the data for regression and classiﬁcation. The SVM algorithm’s goal
    is to create

    a decision boundary or best line that can segregate the n-dimensional space into
    the classes

    such that in the future new data points can be easily put into an incorrect category.
    The best

    Sustainability 2023, 15, 9001

    10 of 18

    line is called the hyperlink. For creating a hyperlink, SVM chooses the extreme
    points. The

    extreme points are called support; hence, the algorithm is named Support Vector
    Machine.

    Decision Tree: The Decision Tree is a supervised machine-learning technique where
    the

    data is split based on a certain parameter. The Decision Tree contains two types
    of entities,

    i.e., leaves and decision nodes. The leaves are outcomes, whereas; on the decision
    nodes,

    the data is split. There are two types of decision trees based on the target variable
    type:

    •

    Categorical Variable Decision Trees: Categorical Variable Decision Trees are those

    which have categorical target variables.

    •

    Continuous Variable Decision Trees: Continuous Variable Decision Trees are those

    which have continuous target variables.

    The proposed SDN-based framework effectively overcomes the problem of network

    anomaly detection in the industrial IoT. The SDN controller has a global view
    and receives

    monitoring information from the SDN switches. The SDN switches are responsible
    for

    monitoring the industrial IoT devices’ trafﬁc ﬂow and sending each packet of ﬂow
    to the

    SDN controller. The SDN controller detects anomalous behavior through the data
    provided

    by the switches. The machine learning algorithm is applied to the SDN controller
    for

    detecting potentially dangerous network trafﬁc. Based on the classiﬁed data, the
    SDN

    controller determines the trafﬁc ﬂow rules for the switches, which makes this
    framework

    effective in network anomaly detection.

    5. Experimentation and Results

    We used the NSL-KDD dataset in our analysis, which is used for network intrusion

    detection. The machine learning techniques, i.e., SVM and Decision Trees, are
    used to

    evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed model. We assessed the machine learning

    algorithms by using the following quality metrics [32]:

    Accuracy =

    TN + TP

    FP + FN + TP + TN

    (1)

    Precision =

    TP

    FP + TP

    (2)

    Recall =

    (3)

    F1-score = 2 × Recall × Precision

    Recall + Precision

    (4)

    5.1. Classiﬁcation Using SVM

    The NSL-KDD dataset is classiﬁed using the linear SVM model and quadratic SVM

    model of classiﬁcation. The beneﬁt of using SVM is that, while it is a linear
    model, we

    can utilize the kernels to represent the linearly non-separable data. Moreover,
    SVM uses

    considerably less memory and is more efﬁcient in large dimensional spaces. The
    dataset in

    the linear and quadratic SVM models is classiﬁed using 125,973 observations. The
    accuracy

    of the quadratic SVM classiﬁer model is higher compared to the linear SVM model.
    The

    prediction speed of the linear SVM model is greater compared to the quadratic
    SVM model.

    The training time taken by the linear SVM model to classify the NSL-KDD dataset
    is 699.22 s;

    whereas; it is 465.28 s in the quadratic SVM model. The summary of the results
    of both of

    the SVM models is shown in Table 5.

    Since the quadratic SVM model shows greater accuracy compared to the linear SVM

    model, the confusion matrix for the classiﬁed data in the quadratic SVM model
    is shown in

    Figure 4, which summarizes the performance of the quadratic SVM classiﬁcation
    model.

    Figure 4a shows the number of observations against the predicted class and true
    class.

    Figure 4b shows the true positive rates and false negative rates. Figure 4c shows
    positive

    predictive values and false discovery rates.

    The scatter plot, ROC curve, and parallel coordinates chart for the NSL-KDD dataset

    using the quadratic SVM model are given in Figure 5. The horizontal lines in the
    scatter

    plot in Figure 5a depict an excellent ﬁt to the data. The ROC curve in Figure
    5b shows

    the area under the curve (AUC) to be 1.00 or 100%, which denotes an ideal curve
    for data

    classiﬁcation. Thus, the positive and negative results are distinguished 100%
    of the time

    using this classiﬁer. The parallel coordinates plot for the dataset in the quadratic
    SVM is

    shown in Figure 5c.

    5.2. Classiﬁcation Using Decision Tree

    The NSL-KDD dataset is classiﬁed using a Decision Tree classiﬁer model, i.e.,
    Fine Tree

    and Medium Tree. A Decision Tree is a quick technique to ﬁnd the most important
    variables

    and relationships between two or more variables. In comparison to other classiﬁcation

    algorithms, they are extremely quick and efﬁcient. Moreover, there is no outsider
    inﬂuence

    or missing data in the Decision Tree; the Decision Tree requires less data. The
    dataset is

    classiﬁed using 125,973 observations. The accuracy of the Acceptable Tree classiﬁer
    model

    is much higher than the Medium Tree classiﬁer model. The prediction speed of a
    Fine

    Tree classiﬁer is also much higher than a Medium Tree classiﬁer. The training
    time of the

    Fine Tree classiﬁer model is 11.029 s; whereas, it is 35.687 s for the Medium
    Tree classiﬁer

    model. The summary of the results of both of the Decision Tree classiﬁer models
    is shown

    in Table 6.

    Since the Fine Tree classiﬁer model shows greater accuracy compared to the Medium

    Tree classiﬁer model, the confusion matrix for the classiﬁed data using the Fine
    Tree model

    is shown in Figure 6, which summarizes the performance of the Fine Tree classiﬁcation

    model. Figure 6a shows the number of observations against the predicted class
    and true

    class. Figure 6b shows the true positive rates and false negative rates. Figure
    6c shows the

    positive predictive values and false discovery rates.

    The scatter plot, ROC curve, and parallel coordinates chart for the NSL-KDD dataset

    using the Fine Tree model are given in Figure 7. The ROC curve in Figure 7a shows
    the

    area under the curve (AUC) to be 1.00 or 100%, which denotes an ideal curve for
    data

    classiﬁcation. Thus, the positive and negative results are distinguished 100%
    of the time

    using the Fine Tree classiﬁer model. The horizontal lines in the scatter plot
    in Figure 7b

    depict an excellent ﬁt to the data. The parallel coordinates plot for the dataset
    in the Fine

    Tree model is shown in Figure 7c.

    5.3. Performance Analysis

    We classiﬁed our data using the SVM models and Decision Trees as shown in Figure
    8.

    In the SVM model, we used the linear SVM model and Quadratic SVM model; whereas,

    in the Decision Trees, the Fine Tree model and Medium Tree model were used. The

    comparison of the accuracy of the classiﬁer models is shown in Figure 8a. The
    bar chart

    shows the accuracy of the Quadratic SVM model to be 99.7%, which is the highest
    compared

    to the other three models. Thus, the Quadratic SVM model is the most accurate
    data

    classiﬁcation model used in our experimentation. The comparison of the prediction
    speed

    of the classiﬁer models is shown in Figure 8b. The bar chart shows the prediction
    speed

    of the Fine Tree classiﬁer model to be 570,000 obs/s, which is the highest compared
    to the

    other three models. Thus, the Fine Tree model is the highest prediction speed
    model used

    in our experimentation.

    6. Conclusions and Future Work

    IoT deployment in the industrial sector has several beneﬁts, such as optimization,

    automation, the elimination of manual processes, and increased efﬁciency. However,

    security remains a challenge in industrial IoT devices and networks. The security
    threats

    and cyber-attacks on industrial IoT networks and devices cause industries and
    businesses to

    suffer ﬁnancial losses, reputational damage, and the theft of important information.
    Many

    approaches and frameworks have been applied for intrusion detection in industrial
    IoT

    devices and networks. Machine learning techniques play a vital role in these approaches.

    In this work, we proposed an SDN-based framework using machine learning techniques
    to

    detect threats and cyber-attacks in industrial IoT networks and devices. We used
    the NSL-

    KDD dataset in our experimentation for classiﬁcation. SVM and Decision Tree classiﬁcation

    models are used for the evaluation of our framework. The performance of the SVM
    and

    Decision Tree is evaluated, and the quadratic SVM showed 99.7% accuracy. In the
    future,

    we will employ newer data sources to enhance the adaptability and efﬁcacy of this
    study.

    scarcity in water resources due to inefficient water management practices. Current
    methods for water control are based on supply rather than demand. Due to the manual
    nature of the current system, there is a lot of wastage of water and human error
    often results in flooding of the fields. Water theft is an additional problem
    in the developing countries. This paper aims to control water level in irrigation
    channels especially in the context of Pakistan''s irrigation network and proposes
    an appropriate demand response solution, catering to the needs of the end user.
    To achieve this purpose, a Gate Automation & Control Module (GACM) has been designed
    and implemented. The module is a deployable and scalable solution that can be
    coupled with any of the existing canal gates to regulate downstream water level
    with minimum involvement of active labor. Experimental results for water level
    setpoint control at Khaira Distributary off Main BRB Canal, Lahore are added to
    validate the usefulness of GACM. Published in: 2015 13th International Conference

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Islamabad, Pakistan I. Introduction Pakistan
    has the largest congruous canal network in the world, running for over 90,000
    km and irrigating a total area of approximately 36 million acres [1]. Currently,
    primitive methods are being used to regulate the system which results in water
    wastage, disputes due to unequal distribution and difficulty in management of
    water resources [2], [3]. In order to ensure all the aforementioned problems are
    addressed, there is a dire need to revisit the deployed water resources and make
    them function more efficiently. This efficient operation can be achieved by engineering
    Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) and feedback control strategies through the use of
    automation and decision support systems [1, 4–6]. The feasibility study for envisioning
    the canal irrigation system as a “smart water grid” and converting it to a fully
    automated CPS has been done by the authors'' group in [1], [7]. In recent years,
    some implementations of automation and control on actual canals have been reported
    in Australia [8], US [9] and Spain [10]. This paper demonstrates canal automation
    and control in the context of a developing country, for instance, Pakistan where
    the incomparably large scales of deployment and general economic constraints demand
    highly cost-effective and robust solutions. Sign in to Continue Reading Authors

    have become the main subjects of different studies in the last decades, due to
    their high influence on crop performance indicators. This study presents the most
    important parameters that have to be monitored in an irrigation management system
    and the most important ones are synthesized: air moisture and temperature, soil
    air and moisture, evapotranspiration. Based on the monitoring of these parameters,
    different control strategies and methods can be applied for optimization and efficiency
    of irrigation systems. The synthesis in this paper starts with classical control
    systems and, also, advanced methods such as fuzzy concept, decision support systems
    and model predictive control. Considering the currently necessity of integration
    into the Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) concept, the paper finally proposes an irrigation
    control system for vineyards. The SCADA architecture is suitable for the Romanian
    context, it allows flexibility and ease of use and it reduced both energy consumption
    and irrigation operation costs. Published in: 2017 9th IEEE International Conference

    IEEE Conference Location: Bucharest, Romania SECTION I. Introduction Irrigation
    quality is a crop performance indicator, its influence being realized both directly
    and indirectly. If we refer to the high quantity of water that crops need, we
    see it as a direct influence factor, as soon as its indirectly role could be seen
    in the influence on the other nutrients availability and on the timing of cultural
    operations. Irrigation requirements are very different from a region to another,
    thus energy efficiency and economic use of water resources depend on a function
    of soil and crop type, climate and moisture [20]. Many factors influence the potential
    water-use efficiency. The meaning of the word potential refers to the maximum
    water-use efficiency that can be achieved when the system is operated properly.
    Global temperature has increased with 0.2-0.3 [ºC] in the last 30 years. The growing
    season in viticulture is very influenced by high or low temperatures. [17] has
    shown that for a 1, 2 or 3 [ºC] rise of temperature, it will also be a crop water
    demand increase with 11%, 19% and even 29%. This paper presents an energy efficient
    proposed system for irrigation management in vineyards. To understand the system
    structure, section II presents the monitored parameters with a huge influence
    on crop productivity. Section III show the main advanced control methods currently
    used in irrigation management, due to the necessity of an advanced irrigation
    system able to manage the installation and receive alerts. The integrated automation
    and telemetry solution for irrigation management in precision agriculture considering
    criteria to energy efficiency and economics, along with the latest control technologies
    is proposed in section IV. SECTION II. Monitored Parameters in Irrigation Management
    Precision of measurements is of high importance in vineyards productivity, modern
    techniques frequently used is focused on the optimization of the oenological potential
    that vineyards have. Precision viticulture is characterized by a crop that is
    dependent of a specific region climate and soil type. This dependence expresses
    the weather influence in vineyards and some of the arguments that support this
    idea are: Daily temperature trend has a huge influence on the grape quality and,
    consequently, on wine [15]; Bunch temperature offers an information related to
    the phenolic compounds maturation [16]; Solar radiation has an impact on phenolic
    compound biosynthesis [18]. A. Air Moisture and Temperature Crop is certainly
    a function of temperature if water is available for optimum satisfaction [1].
    Temperature has a great influence on seeds germination. Due to the biochemical
    processes, the germination phases that include hydration and enzyme activation,
    its degradation and embryo growth are temperature dependent. Validated arguments
    that show the necessity of temperature monitoring are: From 5 to 37 [ºC], the
    rate of photosynthesis is doubled at every 10 [ºC] increase in temperature; The
    respiration rate becomes double at each 10 °C above the optimum temperature; The
    minimum threshold is the temperature below which no growth is possible. Relative
    humidity offers an information regarding the water vapor that is in the air, this
    parameter being in a strong dependence with temperature. Dew point temperature
    explains this dependence, because temperature goes down when the relative humidity
    increases and if the temperature gets cold enough, the air gets to the point in
    which it holds the highest quantity of water vapors. Due to these arguments, air
    moisture and temperature must be monitored in an irrigation management system.
    B. Soil Moisture and Temperature Soil is also very important in irrigation management
    as it is a major source of atmospheric C O 2 and a storage reservoir for carbon
    with soil moisture being a driving force. Some advantages of soil moisture monitoring
    are: The influence in temperature and weather forecasting, due to the fact that
    it has an rise of the evaporation rate that increases the temperature [3]; The
    increasement of the humidity caused by the evaporation rate of the soil moisture
    that increases the dew point; The dependence between temperature and precipitation.
    This is highlighted by the low pressure systems that will condense if air moisture
    is due to the soil moisture evaporation. The result is precipitation occurrence.
    Irrigation management is of high importance in a vineyard. In many regions, growers
    apply irrigations when soil moisture is above an established limit (for example
    50%). Soil moisture is also important because it indirectly influences irrigation
    (the water application and movement across the field, assuring the intake rate).
    The application rate depends of sprinkler and low-volume methods such as deep
    and micro-sprinkles that uses mechanical devices as nozzles [5]. Water that is
    lost by evaporation could be saved by an efficient irrigation appliance capable
    of reducing evaporation with 5 to 15 % depending of the frequency that is used.
    Irrigation without soil moisture monitoring is not indicated, due to the fact
    that this parameter has an influence in the balance between canopy size and fruitfulness
    [19]. The main objective of irrigation is to optimize the plant water stress and
    this could be done by an efficient soil moisture monitoring. The readings of soil
    moisture sensor are temperature dependent and field measured resistance needs
    correction when some differences appear between calibration and field measurements.
    Soil temperature monitoring is influenced in an important proportion by solar
    radiation and humidity. It is considered that soil temperature should be measured
    by sensors that have no moving parts and that do not need calibration. C. Evapotranspiration
    A very important parameter for crop growth and health is evapotranspiration. This
    irrigation management variable is computed based on weather information (air temperature
    and humidity, wind speed etc.). Explanation of the interdependence existing among
    evapotranspiration and meteorological data collected from on-site weather stations
    is offered by using Penman-Monteith method [13]. E T 0 = 0.408Δ( R n −G)+γ 900

    monitoring of several parameters, as seen in chapter II, different control strategies
    and methods can be applied for optimization and efficiency of irrigation systems.
    Different approaches can be used for designing the control strategy in drip irrigation
    systems: constant open-loop control, open loop on/off, feedback control, [23].
    A. Classical PID Control Classical control methods such as proportional, integral
    and derivative methods show good results, Fig. 1. Figure 1. Classical control
    system Show All In [21] a discrete PID controller is used to control an open irrigation
    channel. The actuator is the opening gate and the controller provides the signal
    for position of this gate. PID control is used in [22] in a modified manner, with
    a constrained integral function, and the goal is supplying the appropriate amount
    of water to meet the needs of the plant during the diurnal cycle. A diagram of
    the PID control for soil moisture in dripping irrigation system is presented in
    Fig. 2. The controller computes the command signal based on the error between
    the measured soil moisture from the transducer and the reference one. The actuator
    is represented by a control relay that acts on the water supply valve. Considering
    the varying solar radiation levels, the controller can still follow the soil moisture
    reference, which proved this classical method gives good results. Figure 2. Soil
    moisture PID control Show All B. Fuzzy Control Systems Fuzzy control is a strategy
    used for irrigation management considering several controlled parameters: soil
    moisture, water supply, loss minimization etc. The general architecture for fuzzy
    control of soil humidity is presented in [24], Fig. 3. The water supply is assured
    through a reservoir house height acts as actuating variable h . The soil moisture
    error is the difference between measured soil moisture and the reference one.
    The system has a variable reference depending on the stage of growth of the plant.
    Figure 3. Fuzzy control architecture Show All The soil humidity error''s membership
    function assignment, which is of high importance in fuzzy control, is based on
    the rule that the higher sensitivity membership for little error and the fine
    stability membership for larger error. Totally, there were 16 fuzzy rules in this
    system. C. Decision Support Systems In [6], a decision support system (DSS) is
    proposed for water supply prediction and control. This system collects data from
    a specific weather station. Then, collected data and weather predictions from
    three different sources are analyzed and the result is an evapotranspiration prediction
    and an estimation of plant daily development forecast for the next 10 days. A
    water distribution planning solution is proposed in [8] for irrigation in an arid
    district. Optimal water delivery scheduling for irrigation canals is implemented
    through a DSS system. The DSS structure consists of a water demand module, a supply
    module and a planning module, Fig. 4. Figure 4. DSS architecture for water supply
    scheduling, [8] Show All D. Model Predictive Control Model predictive control
    (MPC) approach is common used in industry offering a number of features: is robust
    against uncertainty system constraints can be handled is easy to accomplish tuning
    is used in multivariable control applications In MPC control strategy the future
    evolution control sequence of the system is determined based on system model by
    minimizing a cost function. The cost function is obtained by minimizing the deviation
    from set points over the prediction horizon, Fig. 5. Figure 5. MPC control Show
    All In [25] a Model Predictive Control framework for real-time irrigation scheduling
    is developed. A state space formulation of the water balance model is developed.
    The accuracy of the water balance approach is affected by uncertain measurements,
    such as evapotranspiration and precipitation and constraints such as limited water.
    The soil moisture deficit set-point tracking is accomplished by the MPC controller.
    The MPC controller also incorporates input and output constraints. The controller
    successfully tracks the commanded set-point as well as meets the constraints.
    SECTION IV. Proposed System for Irrigation Control in Vineyards Irrigation control
    strategies should be integrated in complex automation and telemetry systems. There
    are several such systems in the world, adapted on specific crops and weather.
    Two of the implemented irrigation management systems are presented further. The
    Advanced Scientific Irrigation Management application is a complex SCADA systems
    used for optimization irrigation in an arid district in USA, [6]. In order to
    implement the irrigation program, it is used a 6 six days sample code for each
    of the 369 parcels. Then, code is transferred to the SCADA master system which
    controls the 93 RTU stations by radio communications. Irrigation channels are
    controlled by a Decision Support System (DSS), as described in section III. Advantages
    of this system should be summarized as the overcome of water infiltrations, water
    costs, water-supply shortages, some specific irrigation issues. In [7] an implementation
    of an automated irrigation system, installed in Australia is presented. Efficiency
    of the irrigation system can be improved by an information infrastructure including
    sensors, actuators and supervisory control and data acquisition communication
    network. The task of the supervisory control is to ensure that the physical flow
    capacities are not exceeded. An irrigation system model is constructed based on
    the interconnection of the individual pool models. In order to achieve an entire
    irrigation system under closed loop control where water orders are met in real
    time on demand, the research and development effort has focused on controlling
    water quantity and quality in open channels. Due to knowledge and existing technologies
    in the third wave of the information processing, communication and computing,
    a new telemetry system for precision agriculture should be integrated into the
    Cyber-Physical System (CPS) concept. The CPS paradigm has two connotations. On
    the one hand, it solves the issues related to the way in which inquiry is done,
    whereas the second one is a model that underpins all specific states of the components
    of the process [4]. Considering the analysis on the control systems implemented
    over the world and the specific conditions in the Romanian context, an energy
    efficient irrigation system for water supply control in vineyards is proposed,
    Fig. 6. The irrigation management system for the precision agriculture could be
    seen as a MIMO system. The control strategy follows a fuzzy approach and it considers
    soil moisture control and the disturbances can be air temperature and evapotranspiration,
    as it is a plant disease indictor. Thus, the system must be fully interconnected
    and decentralized, being equipped with the following: One or more telemetry stations
    that establish the irrigation necessity. Considering the arguments exposed in
    the 2nd paragraph, it is of highly importance to have sensors for air and soil
    temperature, air and soil humidity and evapotranspiration computation, [26]. With
    these parameters, they could be calculated the precipitations necessity and the
    irrigations efficiency. A SCADA system (a SCADA master and clients) that receives
    all information from process and, using some specific decision algorithms, sends
    commands to actuators. It must be done a software application that collects and
    processes data from sensors and that has the capability of displaying it in a
    logical format. The main characteristics that a SCADA system for irrigation management
    must have are presented in Fig. 7. A RTU (Remote Terminal Unit) that includes
    solar panels and batteries for independent operation is used for acquisition of
    other field parameters and actuators control. The actuators consist of pumps,
    valves and other Figure 6. Proposed irrigation control system Show All Figure
    7. Main characteristics of the SCADA system in irrigation management Show All
    SECTION V. Conclusions Irrigation management systems should be focused on the
    adequate supply of water in order to increase crop productivity. This study focuses
    at first on the main parameters that must be monitored in an irrigation management
    system to discover the advantages and effects of their control. Both soil and
    air moisture and temperature are monitored with specific measurement probes and
    evapotranspiration can be calculated using Penman-Monteith, Priestley-Taylor or
    Makkink method. The control strategies for irrigation systems are classified into
    4 categories, from classical to new trends equipment that operate directly to
    irrigate the vineyards. All these are chosen for energy efficiency of the system,
    but also for efficient water management. in irrigation control: PID control, fuzzy
    control systems, decision support systems for water supply prediction and control
    and model predictive control. The main contribution of the paper is the proposal
    of an irrigation control system for vineyards, from a Cyber-Physical Systems perspective.
    The SCADA architecture allows a CPS approach and the fuzzy control strategy is
    suitable for the Romanian context. Based on the high quality of measurements,
    the system computes the water supply necessity based on a fuzzy controller. The
    communication system based on GSM modules at the field level brigs flexibility
    and ease of use for the telemetry and automation system. The system architecture
    has many other benefits such as low energy consumption, low administration costs
    and forecasting and diagnosis functions. ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work was supported

    proliferation of embedded systems, wireless technologies, and Internet protocols
    have enabled the Internet of Things (IoT) to bridge the gap between the virtual
    and physical world through enabling the monitoring and actuation of the physical
    world controlled by data processing systems. Wireless technologies, despite their
    offered convenience, flexibility, low cost, and mobility pose unique challenges
    such as fading, interference, energy, and security, which must be carefully addressed
    when using resource-constrained IoT devices. To this end, the efforts of the research
    community have led to the standardization of several wireless technologies for
    various types of application domains depending on factors such as reliability,
    latency, scalability, and energy efficiency. In this paper, we first overview
    these standard wireless technologies, and we specifically study the MAC and physical
    layer technologies proposed to address the requirements and challenges of wireless
    communications. Furthermore, we explain the use of these standards in various
    application domains, such as smart homes, smart healthcare, industrial automation,

    IEEE Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction The Internet of Things (IoT) [1]
    refers to the inter-networking of everyday objects that are equipped with sensing,
    computation, and communication capabilities. These networks can collaboratively
    interact and perform a variety of tasks autonomously. IoT promises to play a remarkable
    role in diverse application domains, such as smart homes [2], medical care [3],
    [4], industrial automation [5], [6], intelligent transportation [7], [8], resource
    management [9], smart cities [10], [11], and energy management [12], [13], as
    shown in Figure 1. For example, in a smart home application, based on user prescribed
    settings, different monitoring and control tasks are carried out by smart sensors
    and actuators, such as the heating control system, air-condition monitoring, and
    fire alarms. Closely related to the IoT are Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication
    [14], Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) [15], Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPANs)
    [16] Wireless Sensors and Actuators Networks (WSANs) [17], [18], and Cyber-Physical
    Systems (CPSs) [19], [20], which are application-dependent terms. FIGURE 1. Applications
    of IoT in different domains. Show All The entire vision of the IoT surrounds the
    concept of communication among smart objects, enabling them to see, hear, think,
    act, and talk to one another to make smart decisions. It fundamentally embeds
    intelligence into the objects by utilizing ubiquitous computing, networking technologies,
    inter-networking protocols, and applications [21]. Both wired and wireless networks
    are utilized to support information exchange at the backbone and local access
    networks. The local access networks, in particular, are wireless, support multi-hop
    communication, and enable mobility [22]. As these networks are usually low-power
    and unreliable, they are referred to as Low-Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs) [23].
    These networks lay the necessary foundation of IoT and contribute to making it
    highly accessible. The aspect of ubiquitous accessibility of services and objects
    to mobile users is imperative because most of the IoT services are targeted to
    mobile users. Another strong aspect is the autonomous operation, where IoT helps
    to decentralize the decision-making process to accomplish autonomous operations
    with minimal human intervention. This autonomous feature is of paramount importance
    for a multitude of industrial applications that enable smart processes and systems.
    This has amplified the vision of the fourth Industrial revolution, also known
    as the Industry-4.0 or smart factory [24]. Although IoT promises to revolutionize
    several application domains and enormously transform the way we live and communicate,
    it imposes challenging requirements from the networking point of view. The first
    essential requirement is reliable wireless network connectivity, which is particularly
    important for applications such as industrial process automation and control,
    healthcare, emergency situations, disaster recovery, home safety [25]. Second,
    timeliness or low latency are requirements that guarantee the bounded and deterministic
    delay of data transfer between different objects so that actions are performed
    on time. For example, industrial process control systems require real-time communication
    between machines and controllers. Third, the low-power operation requirement helps
    the nodes save power and avoid unnecessary communication attempts, thereby preventing
    early death and extending network lifetime. All of these requirements led to the
    development of several standards and technologies. These standards propose different
    features and protocols to satisfy the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of
    different IoT applications. However, the practical use of these standards in different
    IoT applications has resulted in several limitations. These limitations accelerated
    the need for further analysis in order to seek viable solutions to meet existing
    and future demands of IoT applications. In this paper, we review the existing
    low-power wireless standards and technologies. We primarily focus on the Physical
    (PHY) and Medium Access Control (MAC) layers because they directly impact several
    performance metrics, such as reliability, latency, scalability, and energy consumption.
    In this paper: We present an overview of some of the active standardization bodies
    that are working on the development of sophisticated standards and protocols for
    IoT. We discuss and analyze several low-power wireless standards and technologies.
    The Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) 802.15.4 standard
    and its derivations such as Thread, WirelessHART, IPv6 over Low Power Wireless
    Personal Area Network (6LoWPAN), and IPv6 Over TSCH (6TiSCH) are presented. We
    also study the Bluetooth standard and its variants, such as Bluetooth Basic Rate
    and Enhanced Data Rate (BR/EDR) and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Various technologies
    and standards that share common frequency bands, such as Industrial, Scientific,
    and Medical (ISM), generate severe interference in a coexisting environment. We
    investigate how the inherent Physical (PHY) and Medium Access Control (MAC) layer
    design of these standards and technologies help to cope with interference issues.
    We explore the suitability of various standards across different IoT application
    domains, such as smart homes, smart cities, smart healthcare, and industrial automation.
    Possible limitations of each standard in different application domains are also
    highlighted. We emphasize the need to overcome the limitations of the existing
    standards to meet timeliness, reliability, scalability, and energy efficiency
    requirements of IoT applications. We explain how the stringent requirements of
    IoT applications and the constrained resources of objects introduce severe challenges
    in terms of protocol design. The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. In
    Section III, we discuss IEEE 802.15.4, in particular, its PHY and MAC features.
    Several standards based on IEEE 802.15.4 are also presented. Subsequently, we
    discuss how IEEE 802.15.4e overcomes the limitations of IEEE 802.15.4. Section
    IV describes Bluetooth and its radio and link layer working principles in detail.
    The discussion revolves around different versions of Bluetooth such as BR/EDR
    and BLE. Specifically, we demonstrate the communication principles in BLE such
    as beaconing and extended connectivity features. Additionally, we point out the
    limitations of each of the Bluetooth versions. Furthermore, we explain the BLE
    mesh specification. Section V presents the coexistence perspective of different
    standards and technologies that share the 2.4 GHz band. Other non-standard sources
    of interference are also described. In Section VI, we give an overview of the
    Z-wave standard. Section VII examines IEEE 802.11ah, which is another low-power
    wireless standard operating in sub-GHz. In Section VIII, the Long Range (LoRa)
    technology is presented. In Section IX, we discuss broad applications of IoT and
    their characteristics, requirements, and traffic categories. We explore the suitability
    of each standard relative to these application domains. In Section X we discuss
    the existing surveys relevant to IoT. Finally, a conclusion is drawn in Section
    XI. SECTION II. Standardization Bodies A large number of devices from different
    technologies and vendors makes the IoT environment quite heterogeneous, which
    causes interoperability issues across different application domains. To meet this
    challenge, we witness several standardization bodies that accelerated the development
    of low-power wireless standards and technologies. These standards employ unique
    PHY, MAC, network, and application layer enhancements to meet low-power, low-latency,
    high reliability, scalability, and security requirements of IoT applications.
    In the following, we describe some of the well-known standardization bodies that
    are actively working toward developing IoT protocols. IEEE Standards Association
    (IEEE-SA) [26] is the most well-known standardization organization. It mostly
    targets the lower layers in the OSI protocol stack, namely MAC and PHY. In this
    paper, we focus on IEEE 802.15.4, IEEE 802.15.1 (Bluetooth), and IEEE 802.11ah
    due to their low power operation. The IEEE 802.15.4 provides the fundamental blocks
    for many of the key technologies such as ZigBee, Thread, WirelessHART, and ISA100.11a.
    These standards are detailed in Section III. Up to 2017, IEEE-SA has published
    more than 1100 active standards, and it has more than 600 standards under development
    [27]. ZigBee alliance [28] is an open global standard based on IEEE 802.15.4 that
    is targeted to low-power wireless networks. The technical specifications of ZigBee
    are discussed in Section III. The most common applications of ZigBee are in home
    automation, industrial control, and healthcare. They will be described in Section
    IX. The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) [29] is one of the non-profit organizations
    that developed IoT standards such as 6LoWPAN or Routing Over Low power and Lossy
    networks (ROLL). IETF encourages more people to communicate and collaborate on
    new ideas such as improving the IoT use cases in smart cities, healthcare, industrial
    Internet and other related applications by providing solutions to overcome issues
    such as scalability, timeliness, and IPv6 adaptation for low-power wireless networks.
    IETF provides a platform where developers and researchers can collaborate voluntarily
    to improve and build standards. The standard documents provided by the IETF, such
    as the Request for Comments (RFCs), can be accessed freely. For example, (RFC4944)
    [30] was developed in 2007 and updated by the drafts (RFC6282) [31], (RFC6775)
    [32], (RFC8025) [33], (RFC8066) [34] up until 2017 for developing 6LoWPAN standards.
    These documents cover a wide range of topics relating to issues of routing, security,
    and applications in IoT. The European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI)
    [35] is another non-profit body (like IETF) that works for standardization organizations
    in Europe. It produces globally-applicable standards for communication technologies
    for the Internet, such as fixed, mobile, and broadcast, and short-range technologies.
    The Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP TM ) is an example of the ETSI
    standards. Currently, ETSI has 800 member organizations from 67 countries. OneM2M
    [36] is a worldwide organization formed in 2012 that aims to provide and develop
    technical specifications in order to meet architectural, security, and interoperability
    requirements for M2M communication. It targets applications such as smart cities,
    smart grids, smart homes, and healthcare. OneM2M cooperates with more than 200
    companies. International Society of Automation (ISA) [37] targets industrial IoT
    covering applications such as security, safety, batch control, and enterprise
    integration. A widely-adopted standard developed by this body is ISA100.11a [38].
    ISA has more than 40,000 members and 140 committees, subcommittees, working groups,
    and task forces that are working to develop the ISA standards. OpenWSN [39] is
    a project created by the University of California, Berkeley. It aims to provide
    an open source platform for developers and researchers to implement the IoT protocol
    stack. The stack implements different hardware and operating systems, such as
    OpenMote [40] and RIOT [41], respectively. One of the important goals of OpenWSN
    is the adaptation of the Time-Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) concept over IEEE
    802.15.4e. TSCH provides the IPv6 support in the network layer based on the IETF
    6TiSCH implementation [42]. We will discuss TSCH in Section III-H. Internet Protocol
    for Smart Object (IPSO) alliance [43] is an active organization for enabling Internet
    Protocol (IP) connectivity for smart object communication in IoT. IPSO was founded
    in 2008 and targets IoT applications, such as smart cities, home automation, healthcare,
    and energy management. Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) [44] developed and
    licensed Bluetooth technology. It is a non-profit organization that was founded
    in September 1998. This body publishes the core specifications for the different
    version of Bluetooth. In Section IV, we will describe the different versions of
    Bluetooth developed by SIG. Currently, SIG is supported by more than 30,000 member
    companies [45]. Although SIG does not sell any Bluetooth products, it owns the
    Bluetooth word mark, figure mark and combination mark, which collectively make
    up the Bluetooth trademarks. SECTION III. IEEE 802.15.4 IEEE 802.15.4 [46], which
    mainly defines PHY and MAC layer specifications, is considered the defacto standard
    for Low Rate Wireless Personal Area Network (LR-WPAN). The standard was developed
    for low data rate monitoring and control applications that require very low power
    consumption. Due to its appealing features such as low-power, low cost, and moderate
    data rate, it is the most widely used standard for home automation [47], industrial
    automation [48], [49], smart cities [50], and Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs)
    [51]. Most of the existing standards, such as ZigBee [28], WirelessHART [52],
    and ISA100.11a [53], employ IEEE 802.15.4 as the PHY layer technology together
    with certain upper layer modifications. At the MAC layer, the standard offers
    a flexible protocol that tries to achieve a better trade-off among several performance
    metrics, such as energy efficiency, delay, coverage, and data rate. The IEEE 802.15.4
    network supports star, tree, and peer-to-peer network topologies as shown in Figure
    2. The network is composed of two types of devices, namely Full Function Device
    (FFD) and Reduced Function Device (RFD). The FFDs can perform activities like
    network coordination, routing, and sensing, whereas the RFDs are constrained nodes
    that can only serve as end-devices to perform sensing tasks. As coordinators,
    FFDs can form, manage, and maintain a Personal Area Network (PAN), but a FFD can
    manage only a single PAN at a time. The FFDs can also serve as routers that relay
    traffic through intermediate routes from source to destination. They can also
    store routing tables. FIGURE 2. The star and peer-to-peer network topologies supported
    by the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. Show All The following discussion elaborates more
    on the PHY and MAC layer specifications of the standard. A. PHY Layer The PHY
    layer uses the 2.4 GHz ISM [54] frequency band. Different frequency bands are
    allocated to different regions, as listed in Table 2. TABLE 1 Abbreviations TABLE
    2 Frequency Bands of the IEEE 802.15.4 Standard TABLE 3 Bluetooth 5 Support SoC
    Comparison The PHY offers services such as the transmission and reception of PHY
    Protocol Data Units (PPDUs) across the physical channel. It performs a number
    of suitable functionalities like the activation and deactivation of radio transceiver,
    Energy Detection (ED), Link Quality Indication (LQI), Clear Channel Assessment
    (CCA), channel frequency selection, and packet transmission and reception [46].
    The purpose of the ED is to estimate the power of the received signal within the
    bandwidth of the channel so that the MAC layer can avoid interference. CCA is
    a reliable method to determine any activity on the channel before making a transmission.
    CCA works based on multiple sampling of channel energy. For example, it may sample
    the channel five times and report a free channel if there is at least one sample
    less than the noise floor. There are total 27 different channels available across
    all of the bands as defined by the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. For example, the 2.4
    GHz band includes 16 channels numbered from 11 to 25, where each channel has a
    bandwidth of 2 MHz and center frequencies are separated by 5 MHz. They offer an
    achievable data rate of as much as 250 kbps [55]. IEEE 802.15.4 uses Direct Sequence
    Spread Spectrum (DSSS) which mainly supports coexistence by spreading the signal
    over a larger bandwidth. Upon receiving a request from the MAC sub-layer, the
    radio transceiver may operate in one of the three states: transmit, receive, or
    sleep. The energy consumption states of a transceiver can be classified into the
    following states: transmission, reception, and sleep. During idle listening, the
    device is listening to incoming packets, which may result in overhearing packets
    that are not destined for it [56]. It is observed that in most of the commercial
    IEEE 802.15.4 compliant transceivers the energy consumed during idle listening
    is almost the same as receiving or transmitting a packet [57] and is a significant
    cause of energy waste. For example, the TI CC2420 transceiver at 0 dBm output
    power consumes 17.4 mA in transmission and 18.8 mA in idle listening states [58].
    Since nodes have constrained resources, the IEEE 802.15.4 implements duty cycling
    in the MAC protocol to save power. Duty cycling allows a node to sleep by turning
    off its transceivers to conserve energy periodically. B. MAC Layer The standard
    proposes a flexible MAC that can mainly switch between two channel access modes
    known as beacon enabled mode and non-beacon enabled mode. 1) Beacon Enabled (BE)
    Mode In this mode, communication is based on a superframe structure. The superframe
    starts with a beacon period followed by an active period and an inactive period,
    as shown in Figure 3. The active period consists of the Contention Access Period
    (CAP) and Contention Free Period (CFP), while the inactive period allows duty
    cycling. The active period is further subdivided into 16 equally spaced parts
    called time slots. The superframe information is broadcasted through beacons at
    the start of the network. A beacon is a specific frame generated periodically
    by the PAN coordinator to update synchronization and other network related information
    among the nodes. A superframe is bounded by two beacons. After the beacon, the
    CAP immediately starts where nodes compete, using slotted Carrier Sense Multiple
    Access/Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) to transmit new packets to the coordinator
    or request pending packets. To minimize the probability of collisions over the
    channel, slotted CSMA/CA uses the Binary Exponential (BE) Backoff algorithm. After
    the CAP is the CFP, which contains Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) like Guaranteed
    Time Slots (GTSs) for transmission. GTSs are allocated by the coordinator to the
    nodes that require special bandwidth reservations [59]. Nodes request the GTSs
    from the PAN coordinator during the CAP. GTS can be used either for transmission
    or reception, and a maximum of seven GTSs are allowed per superframe. During the
    GTS, the node has exclusive access to the channel at its disposal. FIGURE 3. The
    superframe structure of the BE MAC mode of IEEE 802.15.4 standard. Show All The
    total duration of the superframe, including active and inactive periods, can be
    configured through two important parameters known as Superframe Order (SO) and
    Beacon Order (BO). The network coordinator defines the superframe structure by
    a Beacon Interval (BI), which is the time between two sequential beacons, and
    a Superframe Duration (SD), which is the active duration of the superframe, as
    shown in Figure 3. The values of BO and BI are related as follows [46]; for 0≤
    BI= BO≤14 α× 2 BO symbols View Source α is known as aBaseSuperframeDuration, which
    is the number of symbols forming a superframe when the SO is equal to zero. The
    SO defines the duration of the active period including the beacon frame. The values
    of SO and SD are related as follows: for 0≤ SD= SO≤BO≤14 α× 2 SO symbols View
    Source Therefore, in the case of 2.4 GHz, the value of SD=15.36× 2 SO  ms with
    a BI=15.36× 2 BO  ms . Thus, the value of BI can be adjusted between 15 ms to
    245 s [59], depending on the value of BO and SO. 2) Non-Beacon Enabled (NBE) Mode
    No GTS allocation is employed in this mode. Nodes mainly utilize unslotted CSMA/CA
    for channel access and perform only a single CCA operation without synchronization
    to backoff boundaries [60]. C. Limitations of IEEE 802.15.4 Mac Although IEEE
    802.15.4 MAC has several appealing features for general IoT applications, yet
    it has several limitations for applications that require high reliability, low
    latency, and energy efficiency, as pointed out in [61] and [62]. To address this
    issue, several investigations on the performance analysis of IEEE 802.15.4 MAC
    were conducted [63]–[66]. Studies in [67] show that the selection of the binary
    exponent is random and does not take into account the number of available nodes,
    the communication activity level, or the priority of data packets, resulting in
    a higher likelihood of collisions. The random nature of the binary exponent causes
    nodes to sleep for prolonged periods than required. This leaves the medium unnecessarily
    idle for an extended period, impacting the throughput. A simulation-based evaluation
    of slotted Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA) for beacon-enabled mode for dense
    networks was conducted in [66]. The authors showed that the backoff algorithm
    is not flexible for large-scale networks, since the lower limit of the backoff
    delay is always 0 which is fixed. Thus, it prevents particular ranges for the
    backoff delays. Therefore, it is not sufficient to avoid collisions for large-scale
    networks. The impact on the selection of the BO and SO was analyzed based on the
    average delay. A node that cannot complete its data transmission in the current
    CAP is forced to defer its transmission to the following superframe. Therefore,
    the node has to re-contend to access the medium and face collisions. Such a situation
    makes the delay for the data transmission not only non-deterministic and unbounded,
    but it also deteriorates the throughput. Another study on the performance of slotted
    CSMA/CA for the BE mode was conducted in [63]. The authors showed that the default
    values of MAC parameters, such as MAC minimum binary exponent and number of backoffs,
    may result in lower throughput and high-power consumption. This analytical study
    was based on the Markov model for both saturated and unsaturated periodic traffic,
    and it was suggested to tune the MAC parameters to achieve better results. Anastasi
    et al. [64] gave a comprehensive analysis on the MAC unreliability problem. The
    authors argued that if the power management is enabled, it will result in poor
    packet delivery ratio. The reason was found to be the contention access period
    and its default parameters, such as the minimum and maximum binary exponent value,
    the maximum number of backoffs, and maximum frame retries allowed. The authors
    suggested that the MAC, in its current form, is not suitable for mission-critical
    applications and requires proper tuning of the MAC parameters for better performance.
    Motivated by these shortcomings, several relevant standards and protocols emerged
    to overcome the limitations of IEEE 802.15.4 MAC [68], [69]. We overview these
    protocols and standards as follows. We will present different applications based
    on this standard and elaborates further on their suitability in each application
    domain in Section IX. D. Thread Thread [70] is an open networking stack, which
    has received support from well-known organizations such as Google, Samsung, Nest,
    Freescale, and ARM [71]. It is built on top of the IEEE 802.15.4 PHY and MAC layer
    specifications, operating in 2.4 GHz band. It is cost-effective, reliable, secure,
    works at very low-power, and supports up to 250 devices in a single local mesh
    network. The technology is optimized for low latency (less than 100 ms) and smart
    home networking applications, such as access control, energy management, and light
    control. It does not suffer from a single point of failure due to its mesh networking
    capability, thus improving reliability. It natively supports 6LoWPAN technology
    to benefit IPv6 capability in order to support interoperability. In this way,
    devices can be directly connected to the Internet and can be accessed from anywhere.
    Figure 4 shows the mesh network architecture of Thread. As shown, a typical Thread
    network consists of at least one or more border routers, a router, a leader, sleepy
    end-devices, and end-devices. The border router serves as a gateway that is responsible
    for connecting a Thread network to an adjacent non-Thread network that operates
    on other physical layers like IEEE 802.11 or Ethernet. Multiple border routers
    can be deployed to achieve redundancy. This keeps the mesh network functional
    in case of a failure of the single border router, thereby improving resiliency.
    A router offers routing services to the network devices. It also provides security
    and network joining services for the devices that wish to join the network. A
    router or border router can act as a leader which is required to make decisions
    for some specific functions like assigning router addresses and allowing new router
    requests. FIGURE 4. The mesh networking architecture of Thread. Show All Sleepy
    end-devices can communicate through their parent router and serve as only host
    devices, but they cannot forward messages for other devices. End-devices can exchange
    messages with their parent devices. At the application layer, Thread does not
    impose any particular application layer protocol, however, the common light-weight
    protocols, such as Constrained Application Protocol (COAP), Message Queue Telemetry
    Transport (MQTT), and Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP), can be
    used. The standard implements several security enhancements; it supports Transport
    Layer Security (TLS) [72] and its variant, Datagram TLS (DTLS) [73]. A network-wide
    key is used at the MAC that protects the IEEE 802.15.4 data frames against eavesdropping,
    tampering, and targeted disruption from outsiders. Since Thread and ZigBee mostly
    share the same physical specifications and have several features in common, it
    is expected that they are likely to merge in order to create a uniform IoT standard
    [74]. Although Thread claims to have all of the features mentioned above, there
    are no practical implementations or deployments available based on Thread standard.
    E. IEEE 802.15.4E IEEE 802.15.4, in its 2011 version [46], supports enhanced physical
    specifications that enable a variety of applications (see section III-A). However,
    the standard cannot support mission-critical applications due to several limitations.
    Specifically, in order to meet reliability, low latency, and low-power consumption,
    which are the requirements of emerging applications like Cyber Physical System
    (CPS) based Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) [75], [76], smart health care
    [77], and industrial process automation and control, IEEE released an enhanced
    version known as the IEEE 802.15.4e [78]. It specifically introduces five enhanced
    MAC protocols in the form of MAC behavior modes. These protocols will be elaborated
    in the subsequent discussion. 1) Deterministic and Synchronous Multi-Channel Extension
    (DSME) DSME is an extension of the beacon-enabled MAC mode of the IEEE 802.15.4.
    DSME does not rely on a single channel. Instead, it uses multiple channels and
    has a multi-superframe structure, which has an extended number of GTSs. A multi-superframe
    consists of a collection of consecutive non-overlapping superframes as shown in
    Figure 5. The multi-superframe structure can flexibly support both periodic and
    a periodic traffic. DSME mainly targets multi-hop networks and uses Enhanced Beacons
    (EBs), which are shown as black bars inside the multi-superframe in Figure 5.
    EBs are used to announce the presence of the network and contain information related
    to the size of the time slots, slot frames, and time synchronization information
    to maintain synchronization among the network nodes. The superframe consists of
    only the active period, which is further subdivided into CAP and CFP. Nodes in
    the CAP use slotted CSMA/CA for channel access to transmit monitoring, urgent,
    or a periodic data. The CAP is fixed to 8-time slots during which the nodes should
    stay awake. The CFP occupies the remaining seven slots that are known as the Guaranteed
    Time Slots (GTSs) (DSME-GTSs), which are used to transmit time-critical data.
    As mentioned before, nodes remain awake during the CAP; however, in order to save
    energy, DSME reduces the number of CAP periods, and only the first superframe
    of each multi-superframe uses the CAP. The rest of the superframes inside the
    multi-superframe structure do not make use of the CAP, but rather the whole period
    is treated as a CFP that consists of 15 GTSs, as shown in Figure 3 (Section III-B).
    DSME exploits channel diversity to select the best possible channel in order to
    ensure reliability and robustness against external interference and multi-path
    fading. Therefore, it is particularly suitable for factory automation, smart metering,
    and patient health monitoring. FIGURE 5. The multi-superframe structure of DSME
    MAC mode with extended and reduced CAP. The shaded bars show the CFP consisting
    of GTSs and the white bars show CAP. (a) DSME multi-superframe with extended CAP.
    (b) DSME multi-superframe with reduced CAP. Show All DSME MAC mode is scalable
    due to its distributed nature. Specifically, slot allocation and beacon scheduling
    are not performed by a central entity, but rather they are performed by the network
    devices themselves in a distributed fashion. It is adaptive to time-varying traffic
    conditions and to changes in network topology, where each pair of nodes, based
    on their needs, allocates and deallocates GTS slots. Due to its adaptive capability,
    it can be a good candidate for mobile networks, where data rate requirements and
    topology vary over time. It improves energy efficiency through its Group Acknowledgement
    (GACK) option, where a single Acknowledgement (ACK) frame aggregates the acknowledgments
    of multiple data frames. Although DSME MAC presents significant enhancements,
    some of its shortcomings have been identified as follows. For example, Rodenas-Herraiz
    et al. [79] pointed out the overhead of topology change in large-scale networks.
    In particular, the overhead may be high due to the rescheduling of beacon frames
    and/or selection of non-interfering frequency channels, assuming the multi-superframe
    structure is long enough and contains superframes of all coordinators. This increases
    the energy expenditure of the devices. On the other hand, in a dense network,
    DSME incurs considerable delays due to the TDMA multi-superframe structure, where
    the coordinator and the devices become active only in their respective superframes.
    Therefore, if the part of data transmission cannot be completed in the current
    superframe, it needs to be deferred to the following superframe. The coordinator
    and its associated devices would have to wait for the next multi-superframe to
    resume their transmission. 2) The Low Latency Deterministic Network (LLDN) LLDN
    targets applications that require low latency, such as manufacturing and robotics.
    It only works with the star topology and uses TDMA superframe time slots with
    small packets. The duration of the superframe is fixed and has distinctive slots,
    namely the beacon, management, uplink, and bidirectional time slots. The duration
    of a time slot is 10 ms, and the number of time slots determines the number of
    devices that can communicate. Since the size of the superframe is restricted to
    a certain number of time slots, it only allows a certain number of devices to
    participate in the network. However, in order to make the network scalable up
    to more than 100 devices, the PAN coordinator can use multiple transceivers that
    each operate on a different frequency. Moreover, in order to further reduce latency,
    LLDN makes use of short MAC addresses to decrease frame processing and transmission
    time. Similar to DSME, it also exploits the GACK mechanism to minimize the bandwidth
    overhead. The use of star topology makes LLDN more suitable for factory automation,
    where a large number of nodes often communicate with a central entity. However,
    it has some limitations in terms of scalability, topology, and throughput. The
    standard recommends using multiple transceivers in the PAN coordinator to create
    various networks operating on different channels. However, a study by Patti et
    al. [80] argues that this recommendation imposes a higher cost and greater complexity.
    They propose multi-channel LLDN, which improves scalability by allowing a higher
    number of nodes in the network while maintaining low cycle times without the need
    of multiple transceivers for the PAN coordinator. Berger et al. [81] indicate
    that using a star topology restricts coverage. They propose the extension of the
    star topology, which is to collect data from two-hop sensors with the use of a
    relay node strategy. The relay nodes improve transmission reliability by retransmitting
    undelivered packets. The authors are of the view that the use of reserved slots
    and retransmission strategy in default LLDN reduces the number of sensor nodes
    per network, which impacts data throughput. 3) The Time - Slotted Channel Hopping
    (TSCH) TSCH MAC is considered one of the latest generations of MAC protocols in
    the category of reliable and low-power operation. It aims to satisfy the requirements
    of low-power mesh networks in industrial process automation. TSCH is considered
    the most viable MAC candidate for the IoT protocol stack because of its time and
    channel diversity features [82]. It incorporates mechanisms such as time-slotted
    access and multiple channel communication with channel hopping. Time-slotted channel
    access inherently avoids the nodes that are competing for the channel, eliminating
    collisions and improving throughput. It provides every network node guaranteed
    access to the wireless medium, offering deterministic latency, and builds on a
    communication schedule that coordinates the exchange of information among the
    nodes. In this way, each node exactly knows when to transmit, receive, or sleep.
    TSCH achieves low-power through synchronization, causing the receiver to be active
    precisely when the sender transmits. The improved design of TSCH is influenced
    by Time Synchronized Mesh Protocol (TSMP) which is a proprietary MAC protocol
    designed by the Dust Networks [83]. TSMP became the widely accepted MAC protocol
    in the industrial domain, and in particular, is adopted by WirelessHART [84] for
    its MAC operation [52]. Standards like ISA100.11a [53] and WIA-PA [85] use the
    core concepts of TSMP in their MAC design, alongside some higher layer packet
    format modifications. Below, we present an overview of the TSCH slot frame and
    its functionality. The earlier MAC protocol of IEEE 802.15.4 (see section III-B)
    used a single channel approach in combination with the backoff algorithm in order
    to avoid collisions in a shared medium. TSCH takes a multi-channel approach by
    utilizing channel hopping and maintaining a low duty cycle. Channel hopping intelligently
    mitigates external interference and multi-path fading [86], which makes TSCH highly
    reliable and robust. Today, TSCH commercial products offer 99.9% end-to-end reliability
    while consuming an average current that is below 50 μA at 3.6 V [87]. TSCH Slotframe:
    A slot frame combines several time slots that repeat periodically, as shown in
    Figure 6a. FIGURE 6. TSCH slotframe schedule based on the associated topology.
    (a) TSCH slotframe, it also shows sequence of transmission events within a timeslot
    for a transmitter-receiver node pair. (b) The associated topology where dotted
    arrows show transmission in shared slots and solid arrows represent transmission
    in dedicated slots. Show All Not only does this periodic repetition of slot frame
    provide each node the opportunity to communicate in the network, but it also helps
    to update synchronization and other network related information. TSCH does not
    define and impose a slot frame size; instead, the slot frame size is a design
    parameter that is decided by the application programmer. The size of the slot
    frame can be from 0 to 1000 time slots [88]. Enhanced beacons are sent by the
    nodes to advertise the network. A time slot is long enough to send a maximum size
    packet and receive its corresponding ACK. A typical value of the time slot duration
    is suggested to be 10 ms. If an ACK is not received in a defined time period,
    the retransmission will follow the subsequent time slot that is scheduled for
    the same (transmitter-receiver) pair of nodes. A possible communication schedule
    is depicted in Figure 6a. The slot frame is seven slots long, and there are sixteen
    channel offsets available. Each link is assigned a cell. Some of the cells could
    be dedicated to only one pair of nodes, while others could be shared cells, i.e.,
    more than one pair of nodes can communicate in these slots. There could be a possibility
    of collision in a shared slot, but the standard implements a simple back-off scheme
    to deal with it. Each node only cares about the cell it is assigned to. For example,
    in Figure 6a, when node n 5 transmits a packet to node n 0 , it uses time slot
    3 from the dedicated time slots and channel offset (Ch.05) . F. WirelessHART WirelessHART
    [84] is the first open wireless industrial standard, introduced by the HART (Highway
    Addressable Remote Transducer) [89] foundation. It is mainly designed for industrial
    process measurements and control applications while still being backward compatible
    with the HART legacy systems. It is a mesh network with self-organizing and self-healing
    capabilities in combination with a secure and reliable communication protocol.
    Although Bluetooth and ZigBee were prevalent before the release of WirelessHART,
    they could not fulfill the stringent requirements of industrial control applications
    [52]. Specifically, neither ZigBee nor Bluetooth offered guaranteed end-to-end
    delay and reliability. 1) Network Architecture WirelessHART introduces different
    types of devices in the network as shown in Figure 7: network and security manager,
    gateways, access points, and field devices. The network manager is responsible
    for computing and maintaining the communication schedule and routing tables, as
    well as performing the overall network health monitoring. It can query a particular
    field device through the gateway as requested by the host application. The security
    manager and network manager work collaboratively to provide security against intrusion
    and attacks by generating a different session, joint, and network keys [90]. FIGURE
    7. WirelessHART network architecture showing communication among different kinds
    of devices. Show All 2) PHY and MAC Layers The PHY layer is based on IEEE 802.15.4
    [55]. TSMP is the medium access and networking protocol which offers reliable,
    robust, and low-power communication. It features time synchronized, dedicated
    time-slotted access, link layer ACKs, graph-based routing, and multi-layer security
    on every packet. It targets reliability of greater than 99.99% at low-power, scalability
    of hundreds of mesh nodes, flexibility to support time-varying traffic, security,
    and the ability to withstand harsh industrial environments [91]. The communication
    is governed by a time-slotted schedule which lets the nodes know when to transmit,
    receive, or sleep. TSMP follows the same schedule scheme as of TSCH, where the
    schedule is computed and is represented through cells using different time slots
    and channel offsets as described in Section III-E3. G. Ipv6 Over Low-Power Wireless
    Personal Area Networks (6LoWPAN) The underlying motivation to standardize 6LoWPAN
    [92], [93] was the need to integrate constrained devices to the Internet. IETF
    created the 6LoWPAN and Routing Over Low-Power and Lossy Networks (ROLL) [23]
    working groups with the goal toward standardized IP-based protocols for LLN. The
    ROLL focuses on developing routing solutions for LLNs over IPv6. The fact that
    the IPv6 protocol imposes high overhead and complexity which makes it difficult
    to be deployed in constrained environments, such as the IEEE 802.15.4 network.
    Since the MAC payload of IEEE 802.15.4 cannot be larger than 127 bytes, the 40-byte
    header of IPv6 does not leave much space for actual payload. This prompted the
    need to form an adaptation layer between the network and data link layer in order
    to enable IPv6 packets to fit into the IEEE 802.15.4 specifications. Low Power
    Wireless Personal Area Networks (LoWPANs) impose several constraints, such as
    small packet sizes, different address lengths, small bandwidth, high density of
    nodes, battery operated devices, poor link quality, and duty cycling. This makes
    it challenging to develop an optimized adaptation sublayer to successfully map
    the service required by the network layer on the services provisioned by the link
    layer [93]. In essence, 6LoWPAN defines an adaptation layer through header compression
    (HC) in order to transmit IPv6 packets over the IEEE 802.15.4 network. It supports
    packet fragmentation and reassembly in order to meet the Maximum Transfer Unit
    (MTU) requirements of IPv6, and it allows forwarding to the data link layer for
    multi-hop connections [94]. The 6LoWPAN adaptation layer defines two header compression
    techniques that compress large IPv6 headers (in the best case) to several bytes.
    The compression technique, 6LoWPAN-HC1, compresses IPv6 packets that contain IPv6
    link-local addresses. The size of the packet is minimized by eliminating fields
    such as IP version, traffic class, flow label, and hop limit. The 6LoWPAN-HC2
    technique is proposed for the compression of UDP, TCP, and ICMP. The main objective
    in proposing the HC1 and HC2 techniques was to perform compression in a stateless
    manner that did not require any previous agreements between the two nodes. H.
    6TiSCH IETF formed 6TiSCH [95] working group to support IPv6 over TSCH (see Section
    III-E). 6TiSCH contributes to the IoT by bonding the unique features of TSCH and
    IP networking mechanisms in order to produce an interoperable Industrial IoT (IIoT)
    protocol stack [96]. This will support TSCH MAC being placed under an IPv6 enabled
    protocol stack running 6LoWPAN, IPv6 RPL [97], [98], and CoAP [99], [100]. Figure
    8 shows the reference protocol stack for 6TiSCH [101]. For the successful integration
    of TSCH with upper layer protocols, 6TiSCH introduces a functional entity that
    is responsible for scheduling TSCH time slots to be sent on the network. This
    entity resides at the higher layer and is known as 6TiSCH Operation Sublayer (6top).
    FIGURE 8. Envisioned 6TiSCH protocol stack [101]. Show All 6top is a logical link
    control that resides between the IP layer and the TSCH MAC layer. It controls
    the TSCH schedule, collects the connectivity graph, and monitors and optimizes
    the schedule of the cells. It supports both centralized and distributed scheduling
    approaches. The scheduled cells are labeled as either hard cells or soft cells.
    Hard cells cannot be dynamically reallocated by 6top. Rather, they are typically
    scheduled by a scheduling entity such as Path Computation Entity (PCE), that can
    move or delete cells in the TSCH schedule. In contrast, soft cells can be reallocated
    by the 6top dynamically. Typically, a distributed scheduling entity schedules
    these cells. 6top records the performance of the cells to the same neighbor. If
    a cell performs poorly compared to the other cells with the same neighbor, it
    moves the cell to a different channelOffset and slotOffset, where channelOffset
    and slotOffset perform better. In this way, the 6top sublayer can cope with the
    interference reliably. SECTION IV. Bluetooth In this Section, we discuss the history
    of Bluetooth technology and technical details such as radio, link layer, and network
    topology. Bluetooth is a low-power wireless technology used for short-range communication.
    It was designed to replace serial cables with the wireless links [102]. Nowadays,
    aside from connecting devices like mice, keyboards, cell phones, headsets, and
    multimedia devices, it is used to connect sensors, actuators, controllers, and
    critical wireless infrastructures. Availability is one of the main advantages
    of Bluetooth. The Allied Business Intelligence (ABI) research group predicted
    that by 2021 there would be 48 billion devices connected to the Internet, 30%
    of which would be Bluetooth enabled [103]. Bluetooth was introduced in 1999, and
    the first specification was released in 2001 [104]. In 2002, IEEE assigned the
    802.15.1 standard for it [105]. The technology is divided into two major categories:
    First, Bluetooth Basic Rate and Enhanced Data Rate (BR/EDR) refers to the earlier
    versions of Bluetooth mainly designed for file transmission and audio streaming.
    It is reported that in 2015, 116.32 million BR/EDR headsets were shipped [106].
    Second, BLE refers to the recent versions of Bluetooth targeting low-power consumption
    for IoT applications. Due to the consumer demand for low-power and high throughput,
    both BLE and BR/EDR are available in some devices like smartphones and laptops.
    They are known as dual-mode Bluetooth and switch the protocol stack from BR/EDR
    to BLE and vice versa when is needed [107]. Table 4 highlights the key features
    of each version. TABLE 4 Comparison of Bluetooth Standards A. Bluetooth Basic
    Rate and Enhanced Data Rate The first version of BR/EDR was only designed for
    file sharing by using an Asynchronous Connection-Less (ACL) link. The link is
    a single point-to-multiple point link that can be used for broadcasting data and
    can support both asymmetrical and symmetrical connection. The audio streaming
    capability has been added to BR/EDR by using a Synchronous Connection-Oriented
    (SCO) link in v1.2. The new link provides up to three symmetrical point-to-point
    links that reserve time slots in order to guarantee timely transmission. To avoid
    delay in voice transmission, SCO packets do not deliver ACKs. In 2003, SIG enhanced
    the link and released eSCO to improve voice transmission reliability. The higher
    quality is achieved by employing a limited number of re-transmissions for lost
    or damaged packets. Additionally, this version employs Adaptive Frequency Hopping
    (AFH) to improve coexistence with other wireless protocols [108] (Section V discusses
    AFH in detail). Bluetooth versions up to v1.2 provide a maximum throughput of
    721.2 kbps, known as Bluetooth Basic Rate (BR). Due to the high demand for large
    file and audio transmission, BR was unable to fulfill the throughput requirements.
    Therefore, in 2004, SIG introduced Bluetooth v2.0 to improve throughput and named
    it as Bluetooth Enhanced Data Rate (EDR). This version increased the throughput
    by 2.1 Mbps by using the Differential Phase Shift Keying (DPSK) modulation technique
    [109]. Although EDR tries to improve the data rate, it does not satisfy the entire
    user requirements. Thus, in April 2009, SIG launched Bluetooth v3.0, known as
    Bluetooth High Speed (HS) [110]. Bluetooth HS delivers up to a 24 Mbps data rate
    by using the 802.11 radio. Alternative MAC/PHY (AMP) controller [111] changes
    the radio from BR/EDR to 802.11 and vice versa. AMP enables the 802.11’s radio
    when higher throughput is required. After that, it reverts to primary BR/EDR radio
    to save power. 1) BR/EDR Radio The radio operates on the 2.4 GHz ISM band at frequencies
    between 2402 to 2480 MHz. It uses Gaussian Frequency Shift Keying (GFSK) modulation
    with three output power classes: class one has the maximum output power 100 mW
    and achieving communication range 100 m, class two and class three support output
    power 2.4 mW and 1 mW, respectively. The communication range of class two and
    class three is almost 10 m. Power classification improves energy efficiency and
    avoids interference with other networks by reducing the communication range. For
    example, a few meter communication ranges satisfy the user requirement for Bluetooth
    headphones and a smartphone. Lowering the signal propagation range reduces noise
    for other wireless networks in the vicinity. The physical channel is subdivided
    into 1, 3, or 5 time slots; each time slot is 625 μs and Time Division Duplex
    (TDD) provides full duplex transmission. In TDD, both the uplink and downlink
    can transmit information in the same frequency by using a synchronized time interval
    which resolves contention over the wireless channel. In BR/EDR, the frequency
    band is divided into 79 channels, and each channel is 1 MHz wide. Figure 9(a)
    shows the channel assignment of BR/EDR. The radio uses the Frequency Hopping Spread
    Spectrum (FHSS) technique to avoid interference from any coexisting Bluetooth
    devices with other technologies that share the same frequency band. In the FHSS
    technique, the radio switches the transmission channels 1600 times per second;
    therefore, if a transmission encounters noise on one channel, there is a chance
    that the next channel would be free of noise. In Bluetooth v1.2, AFH added a technique
    that blacklists the channels based on traffic load as good or bad channels. This
    minimizes the chance of collision by only performing transmission in the good
    channels. FIGURE 9. BR/EDR, BLE, IEEE 802.15.4, and IEEE 802.11 sharing 2.4 GHz
    frequency band. Show All 2) Network Topology In BR/EDR, devices communicate in
    a network called a piconet. A piconet is a star based topology, in which a node
    can only communicate with a central node called master and the others are called
    slaves. In the master node, the built-in clock is responsible for synchronizing
    master-slaves communication. The slave nodes receive an inquiry message from the
    master node to identify the address and clock phase. With this information, the
    slave nodes can compute the channel hopping sequence to identify when and on what
    channel to listen. The slaves can only initiate communication after receiving
    permission from the master node. There are two types of slave nodes: active and
    parked. In a piconet, one master, up to seven active slaves, and up to 255 parked
    slaves can coexist. Therefore, in order to address the active and parked slaves,
    three and eight bits are required respectively. The master node continuously polls
    the active slaves to see if they have data to transmit. If an active slave does
    not respond to the polling for a long period, it loses its three-bit active slave
    address and becomes a parked slave by obtaining an eight-bit address. For the
    parked slaves to rejoin the network, the master node periodically checks their
    status if they have any data to transmit. If so, the master node reassigns the
    three-bit active slave address. Since each piconet uses its own frequency pattern
    that is generated by the master node, it would be possible for several piconets
    to coexist. As shown in Figure 10, neighboring piconets can join and construct
    a new network topology called a scatternet. A scatternet is a combination of two
    or more piconets through node sharing. With this, a slave can be shared by two
    piconets, or it can be a master in one piconet and a slave in another. In this
    way, by combining piconets, Bluetooth can extend the number of nodes in the network.
    For example, in Figure 10, the nodes are organized into three piconets: A, B and
    C. However, the piconets can communicate with each other using the shared nodes.
    The shared node between piconets A and B switches the roles from a slave in A
    to a master in B and vice versa. On the other hand, the shared node in piconets
    B and C remain as a slave in both. FIGURE 10. A sample of Bluetooth scatternet
    formation. Although Bluetooth is a star-based technology, node role switching
    enables connection establishment with other networks in vicinity. Show All 3)
    Link Controller Bluetooth does not support the OSI model or the TCP/IP protocol
    stack because it has its own MAC protocol for communication management called
    the link controller. Figure 11 shows the state diagram of the link controller
    in BR/EDR. There are three primary states: standby, connection, and park. The
    standby state is the default state that waits for the connection event. It is
    designed to save power when the connection is not required. The connection state
    is when the BR/EDR radio turns on to discover devices in the vicinity and starts
    exchanging information if they are ready to communicate. Park mode is a deep sleep
    mode that helps to save power when the connection is not required for a long period.
    Only slaves can switch to this mode. They receive the synchronization packet periodically,
    and, once received, they can then join the network whenever it is needed. Before
    switching from the standby mode to the connection state, there are some sub-states
    such as Device Discovery and connection establishment. The connection establishment
    sub-state discovers the devices that are willing to initiate the connection. The
    Device Discovery sub-state has three sections. In the inquiry section, the device
    that attempt to initiate the connection hops among 32 out of the 79 channels,
    which are known as the inquiry channels, and broadcasts ID packets. For channel
    hopping, it uses the built-in clock and pseudo-random numbers to generate the
    pattern. On the other side, the device that is about to become discoverable switches
    to the inquiry scan state and waits for the expected ID packets in the inquiry
    channel. It listens for 1.28 s in every channel. It switches the channels slower
    than the device that broadcasts the ID packet in order to increase the probability
    of handshake at the same time and the same channel. After receiving the ID packet,
    it replies in the inquiry response state with the Frequency Hop Synchronization
    (FHS) packet. The packet contains the node’s address, the clock value, and value
    used for synchronization. After the devices are discovered and the packets have
    been exchanged, the connection establishment sub-state starts. This state is much
    faster than the inquiry state because both devices know each other’s frequency
    and clock information. The previously discovering device changes to the page state
    and becomes the master node while the discovered device changes the state to page
    scanning and becomes the slave. After defining the roles, the connection state
    starts. The master polls the slaves and waits for the response from the slaves.
    During the connection state, the device can be in one of three modes: sniff, active
    and hold. In the active mode, the master node keeps scheduling the slaves by transmitting
    POLL packets. The packet exchange stops in the hold mode, and the master and slave
    nodes get informed about the duration of time that they need to hold. The sniff
    mode is designed to save the battery. In this mode, during the connection the
    device can be temporarily absent from the piconet. For example, a device that
    is not operating, such as a mouse or keyboard, puts itself in sniff mode and transitions
    to the active mode when needed. FIGURE 11. Link controller state for BR/EDR designed
    for communication establishment and power saving. Show All 4) Limitations of BR/EDR
    Two major limitations of BR/EDR are high power consumption and lack of scalability.
    Although BR/EDR uses the standby state, parked mode, and effective duty cycling
    to save energy, these techniques are not enough to guarantee the low-power consumption
    requirement of some IoT applications. A major disadvantage of BR/EDR is high power
    consumption. This is because of continuous polling of the slave nodes by the master
    node in the absence of data to transmit. Many studies address this problem and
    propose scheduling algorithms for polling the slave nodes such as, [112], [113],
    and [114]. Chakraborty et al. [115] proposed a solution for adaptive polling of
    slave nodes. In their method, the master node polls the slave based on the probabilistic
    scheduling estimation. This allows the node to reduce power consumption by extending
    its standby time. Also, in [116], the performance of different scheduling algorithms,
    such as pure round-robin, gated round-robin, and exhaustive round-robin for polling
    the slave nodes in BR/EDR have been evaluated using OPNET simulator. The second
    reason behind the high power consumption of BR/EDR is the scanning of a large
    number of channels (32 channels) for Device Discovery. For example, Duflot et
    al. [117] pointed out the issue and proposed a probabilistic model to scan the
    inquiry channels. They also analyzed the power consumption performance of Device
    Discovery in the best and worst case scenarios. In [118], the effect of Device
    Discovery complexity on power consumption has been analyzed. They proposed the
    adaptive rendezvous protocol as a method of optimizing Device Discovery performance.
    The lack of scalability and mesh networking are other weaknesses of BR/EDR. This
    version of Bluetooth only supports a maximum number of eight nodes, and slave
    nodes are not able to connect to each other directly because of the star-based
    topology. This standard has been primarily developed for the scenarios in which
    a computer plays a master node role, and a limited number of devices, such as
    a mouse, keyboard, and headset, are connected as slaves. Scatternet is one of
    the most highlighted solutions for performing mesh networking and improving the
    scalability of BR/EDR. Scatternet is a formation that is not natively supported
    by the core specification, but there is a huge amount of research that proposes
    scatternet-based solutions or improves on the scatternet formation. For example,
    Jedda et al. [119] mentioned the time efficiency problem in scatternet formation
    and proposed an algorithm to solve this challenge. They also compared the performance
    of other scatternet formation algorithms, such as BlueStars [120] and BlueMesh
    [121]. In [122], the problem with scatternet formation, specifically, was that
    the network overhead was caused by an increased number of bridges that were switching
    the piconets. This increases the probability of packet loss. Reference [123] analyzed
    the performance of algorithms for Bluetooth scatternet formation namely, BlueTrees
    [124], BlueStars and the BlueNet protocol [125], and revealed the problem of time-consuming
    Device Discovery in a scatternet network. In general, these works conclude that
    scatternet is not a reliable and robust solution for Bluetooth networking, specifically
    due to the discovery delay and routing challenges. B. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
    BLE, introduced by SIG in 2011, was created for low-power wireless applications
    that did not require high throughput. To achieve low power consumption, the link
    layer, PHY layer, and packet formats were redesigned. In addition, while BR/EDR
    designed for only two-way communication, BLE devices are capable of acting only
    as either a transmitter or a receiver. For example, a remote control only needs
    to transmit a short command, and it does not need to receive a response. On the
    receiving side, a TV or lamp acts only as a receiver, waiting for a command to
    act. This results in design simplification, yielding higher power efficiency.
    In December 2013, SIG released the first update (v4.1) for the technology [126].
    This update can be applied over the air, and no hardware change is required. In
    the first version of BLE, the devices were only able to establish a connection
    as master or slave. However, in the new update, the link layer is redesigned and
    allows devices to switch their roles when needed. One year later, SIG made noticeable
    changes and released version 4.2 [127]. In this new update, the actual payload
    size was increased from 27 Bytes to 251 Bytes. Increasing the payload size while
    keeping the same packet format increased the throughput up to 2.6 times more.
    This increase in the packet size also increased the feasibility of IPv6 support.
    Although version 4.2 does not support IPv6 in the core specifications, IETF published
    RFC (7668) [128] to provide IPv6 support over BLE with the adaptation of 6LoWPAN
    protocol stack. Bluetooth 5, introduced in December 2016, is the latest version
    of BLE [129]. Its main aim is to overcome the limitations of the older versions
    by increasing the range, size of advertisement payload, and throughput. The extension
    in range provides indoor application coverage and even enables building-to-building
    connectivity. In addition, advertisement extension was introduced in this version
    in order to increase the advertisement payload up to 8 times more by using data
    channels as secondary advertisement channels. This opened a new domain of applications
    for Bluetooth beacons. The last improvement was increasing the data rate by doubling
    the modulation rate, also called BLE high-speed mode. This mode helps lower power
    consumption because of the shorter radio operation time that is needed for transmitting
    the same amount of data. It also improves the coexistence of the technology with
    other devices through shorter occupancy of air time. An application of this mode
    is over-the-air-update of IoT devices. 1) Radio As Table 4 shows, the general
    transmit power range in BLE is between −10 dBm and 10 dBm. However, theoretically,
    version 5 supports output power up to 20 dBm. Similar to the classic version,
    the PHY layer in BLE operates in the 2.4 GHz frequency band. In contrast to BR/EDR,
    it has 40 channels, and each channel is 2 MHz wide. Among these channels, there
    are three special channels called advertisement channels. As shown in Figure 9(b),
    these channels are placed in the center frequency of 2402 MHz, 2426 MHz, and 2480
    MHz and are specified with a gray color. The reason for choosing these frequency
    centers is to avoid the most common cause of interference in the 2.4 GHz, which
    is IEEE 802.11b/g/n. Since IEEE 802.11 b/g/n channels are 22 MHz wide, they overlap.
    Therefore, the conventional technique is to use only none-overlapping channels
    which are channel 1, 6, and 11. Thus, advertisement channels are strategically
    located in places that have minimum interference with non-overlapping channels
    in IEEE 802.11 b/g/n [130]. Advertisement channels are used for various purposes,
    such as Device Discovery, connection establishment, and broadcasting. In BR/EDR
    32 channels are assigned for connection initiating which causes significant power
    consumption and delay. Where BLE reduced initiating links down to three advertisement
    channels that the receiving device needs to scan. By limiting the number of channels,
    connection establishment is faster and more power efficient compared to BR/EDR.
    Although both versions use the FHSS and AFH to cope with interference, only data
    channels are involved in frequency hopping in BLE. Data channels are channels
    that are reserved for information exchange. Please note that BLE 5 in advertisement
    extension mode uses data channels as secondary channels for advertisement. Before
    switching to data channels on the sender side, the device sends a special PDU
    in the advertisement channels and returns to sleep. In the receiver side, the
    device listens to these channels to pick up the PDU. Finally, GFSK modulation
    is used for radio transmission. The modulation rate is 1 Mbps, except in the BLE
    5 high-speed which is 2 Mbps. 2) Link Layer Compared to BR/EDR, the new link layer
    has been simplified to reduce the power consumption and provides a faster connection
    establishment [131]. BLE has only a single packet type, instead of the 17 types
    of packets that are used in the BR/EDR. In particular, BR/EDR has a specific packet
    format for different modulations and file or voice transmission, on the other
    hand, BLE omitted the voice streaming capability and only has GFSK modulation.
    This simplifies the processing of resource-constrained devices. Connection establishment
    only requires scanning advertisement channels. Subsequently, based on the PDU
    format received, it either switches to data channels or receives the broadcast
    data [132]. Figure 12 shows the state machine of BLE, which has five states. Standby
    is the initial or default state. This state is designed to save power, and no
    sending or receiving happens in this state. The device may switch to this state
    from any other state. For example, after advertising device returns to standby
    mode to save power. Advertising is the first step for any BLE connection. In the
    link layer, advertisement channels are responsible for broadcasting PDUs. Based
    on the reason for advertising, these PDUs are classified as either: non-connectable
    advertising, connectable advertising, discoverable advertising, directed advertising,
    scan request, scan response, or connect request [133]. Advertising may result
    in communication establishment or merely broadcasting data. Figure 13(a) shows
    the process in the advertising state. During the Adv_Interval, devices send the
    same PDU in the advertisement channels (channels number 37, 38, and 39), return
    to the standby state for the duration of Adv_Delay, and then repeat the process.
    Scanning state is divided into two parts: passive scan and active scan. In the
    passive scan, the receiver only listens to the advertised packets and does not
    respond. In the active scan, the receiver may respond the received packet to get
    more information in order to make the connection. Initiating happens when the
    initiator receives the packet from the advertiser, and it responds to the packets
    by sending initiating packets. Connection is only required when the devices need
    to switch to data channels and exchange information. The advertising device becomes
    the master node, and the initiating device becomes a slave node. Then, the advertisement
    channels hand over the responsibility to the data channels by employing the AFH.
    After the connection ends, the device is only allowed to transition to the standby
    state. FIGURE 12. BLE link layer state has five states: Standby, Scanning, Advertising,
    Initiating, and Connection. Show All FIGURE 13. Advertisement and scanning process
    in BLE. (a) shows the advertising device, and (b) shows the process in a scanning
    device. Show All C. Bluetooth Beacon The idea of Bluetooth beacons was first introduced
    by Apple and named as iBeacon [134]. A Bluetooth beacon is equipped with BLE and
    was designed to be an simple one-way communication channel. Due to the low-power
    consumption of BLE, these beacons can operate for several years with a small battery.
    The concept of beaconing in Bluetooth refers to the periodical broadcasting of
    small pieces of information, such as sensor data or marketing information. Bluetooth
    beacons have applications in many areas, such as train stations, smart parking,
    and indoor positioning in order to help people by providing a platform directly
    to their smartphones. Currently, there are various types of BLE beacons are available
    in the market, such as Eddystone [135], which is developed by Google in 2015.
    Today, the availability of Bluetooth in smartphones allows people to interact
    with the technology easily. The maximum payload size for advertisement channels
    is 31 B. However, this is only enough to broadcast a short message with a limited
    number of characters. For example, in marketing applications, the packet size
    is not able to carry enough information to introduce the products. On the other
    hand, increasing the packet size creates other complications. For example, [136]
    shows that increasing the packet size in advertisement channels may result in
    significant interference in dense BLE environments. In Bluetooth 5, advertisement
    extension provided a solution to this problem. D. Bluetooth 5 Bluetooth 5 added
    new features to the previous versions. As shown in Figure 9, channel allocation
    in this version is the same as the older versions. However, the maximum transmit
    power increased from 10 dBm to 20 dBm. As mentioned earlier, the boldest enhancements
    in this update are an increase in range by employing Forward Error Correction
    (FEC), utilizing advertisement extension by using the data channels as secondary
    channels, and increasing the throughput by doubling the modulation rate [142].
    We explain these features as follow. 1) BLE Coded and FEC One of the major issues
    in IoT devices is the range limitation, and Bluetooth-enabled devices are not
    an exception. Generally, common solutions for range extension are mesh networking
    and increasing transmission power. Mesh networking and IPv6 extend communication
    range by routing packets to reach their destination. This causes network traffic
    and consumes power from other nodes as well. On the other hand, increasing transmission
    power to achieve more extended point-to-point connectivity causes higher power
    consumption in the transmitter. To avoid these problems, the FEC feature is added
    to BLE. Typically, wireless propagation of waves (transitional region) is much
    longer than the connected region. In BLE connected region is where the acceptable
    Bit Error Rate (BER) in the receiver side is less than 10 −3 bits. For example,
    in Figure 14, node C can receive the signals from node A. However, due to path
    loss and interference, bits are corrupted, and data is not reliable. FIGURE 14.
    Connected region and transitional region in BLE 5 long range. Show All In FEC,
    several bits represent a single bit. If the receiver bits get corrupted, it can
    identify and recover these bits based on the pattern that represents each bit.
    Therefore, using a higher number of redundant bits makes it easier to recover
    the bit. There are two options available in version 5 for coding: S = 8 and S
    = 2. This means that it replaces a single bit with 8 and 2 bits, respectively.
    This feature increases the range up to 4 times and enables Bluetooth 5 to cover
    an entire house or extended outdoor area. Due to the extra bits added to the packet,
    the actual bit rate per second drops from 1 Mbps down to 125 kbps in S=8 and down
    to 500 kbps in S=2 [143]. It is important to note that due to the extra bits,
    the larger packet is more sensitive to interference due to the longer transmission
    time. 2) Advertisement Extension Since only three advertisement channels are available
    in BLE, an increase in the payload size will increase the traffic in these channels.
    Because of this, advertisement extension only uses the advertisement channels
    to address the next packet in data channels. To initiate this feature, the device
    sends the first packet, which includes the pointer to the channel that is randomly
    selected from the 37 data channels. The randomly selected channel is known as
    the secondary channel for advertisement. Figure 15 shows the packet format in
    advertisement channels and the data channels. The transmitted packet in the main
    advertisement channels has a maximum payload of 37 B; however, the secondary advertisement
    channels can carry up to 255 B in their payload. Furthermore, it is also possible
    to extend the payload by adding the next packet address and making a chain for
    data streaming applications. Before this, frequency hopping was only applied in
    the connection mode. Since the data channels are randomly selected as the secondary
    channels in advertisement extension, the receiver needs to know the channel number
    and time to listen. Therefore, the primary packet broadcasted by the advertisement
    channels must contain the hopping pattern. Marco et al. [144] performed a simulation
    experiment to evaluate the performance of service ratio, communication delay,
    and battery life, when advertisement extension is used. They claim that advertisement
    extension offers better performance compared to the connection-oriented and the
    basic advertisement in BLE concerning the factors above. However, they also pointed
    out the issues of higher losses, in comparison with connection mode, and latency,
    compared to the basic advertisement. FIGURE 15. BLE 4.2 and 5 (LE1M, LE2M) packet
    format. Show All 3) Bluetooth 5 2 Mbps In BLE 5 increasing the speed is an optional
    mode known as 2 Mbps version. This mode only operates on data channels and increases
    the throughput by doubling the modulation rate. One of the applications for this
    mode is upgrading the IoT device’s firmware over the air. In this case, higher
    speed helps saving energy by reducing the duty cycle, besides, shorter over the
    airtime minimizes the probability of the collision with other operating networks
    in the frequency band. Please note that BLE 5 maintained the 1 Mbps as the default
    mode to support backward compatibility with the older versions. Because every
    packet transmission requires a gap called Inter-frame Space (IFS) between packets
    and ACK to guarantee a successful transmission, the actual throughput in BLE is
    less than the modulation rate. In BLE IFS is defined as 150 μs for all the versions,
    but packet transmission and ACK periods vary based on the modulation rate. For
    example, as shown in Figure 16 although the packet size in v5 2 Mbps has one more
    octet, the transmit time is almost half of the v4.2 and v5 1 Mbps. This also explains
    the shorter period for ACK. Packet_Transmission_Time=(Packet_size×8)/Modulation_rate
    , however, in order to achieve the actual data rate only the payload of the packet
    has to be considered. Therefore, the actual throughput can be computed by Equation
    (1). Throughput= L payload T frame +IFS+ACK+IFS (1) View Source Where, Transmit_packet+IFS+ACK+IFS
    are in μs and Payload is in bits. From the Equation, it can be observed that the
    actual payload for v5 2 Mbps is (251×8)/(1064+150+40+150)=1.4Mbps . Consequently,
    v5 2 Mbps is 1.7 and 4.6 times faster than v5 1 Mbps/4.2 and 4.0/4.1 respectively.
    FIGURE 16. BLE packet transmission. Show All E. Bluetooth Mesh Draves et al. [148]
    showed the importance of mesh networking over WPAN. Although Qualcomm introduced
    a proprietary Bluetooth mesh known as CSRMesh [149], in the official Bluetooth
    mesh specification was later released by SIG in July 2017 [150]. Prior to this,
    Bluetooth suffered from shortcomings such as a single point of failure, limited
    network size, and range extension. Bluetooth mesh allows 3200 nodes to operate
    in a network. It enables a wide range of applications, such as in smart homes
    and industrial automation, where scalability is a major issue. The new software
    stack supports the BLE versions 4.0 through to 5. The more nodes joining the network,
    the more robust and reliable the network will be due to the nature of mesh networking
    and the ability to have multiple available paths for routing. Nodes in Bluetooth
    mesh are divided into several types. The first type is the low-power nodes that
    mostly rely on battery power [151]. They have the responsibility of transmitting
    or receiving information and going back to sleep for the defined period. Another
    type is called the friend nodes. They are mostly connected to the main power grid.
    Due to the lack of power limitation, they can perform more complex tasks. Friend
    nodes store the incoming message for low-power nodes. BLE shares the radio and
    link layer with Bluetooth mesh in order to adopt any BLE-enabled devices to work
    with mesh networking. F. Limitations of BLE Although BLE has many benefits, such
    as low-power consumption, beaconing, and availability in many devices, there are
    some issues associated with it. It still needs to rely on dual-mode devices and
    BR/EDR for audio streaming and bulky file transmission. There are studies in which
    researchers tried to implement audio transmission over BLE. Gentili et al. [152]
    introduced BlueVoice and examined the feasibility of voice transmission over BLE.
    They also mentioned the requirements, such as using 64.3 kbps bandwidth to transmit
    voice quality of 16 kHz. In their experiment, they measure the power consumption,
    memory, and processing requirements. Another limitation is the lack of seamless
    IPv6 connectivity in the core specification. This leads to a dependency of BLE
    on other networks like Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) or LTE to translate
    the Bluetooth packets to IP packets [131], [153], [154]. For example, a BLE-enabled
    smartwatch is unable to transmit heartbeat information directly to the Internet.
    It has to be done in two steps. First, this information has to be forwarded to
    a smartphone. Then, the smartphone converts the BLE packet to an IP packet to
    be routable over the Internet and transmits it via WLAN or LTE. SECTION V. Coexistence
    in 2.4 GHz Spectrum Wireless networks are susceptible to radio interference. The
    impact of interference becomes even more deteriorated if they operate in the same
    frequency band because it causes disruptive effects in the transmission [155].
    Interference can cause packet loss, latency, jitter, false alarms, and synchronization
    errors [155]. All of these adverse effects, in particular, cause severe problems
    for mission-critical applications. As the 2.4 GHz band is unlicensed globally,
    many technologies use this band for their devices throughout the world, thereby,
    making the band more crowded. In 2003, the IEEE 802.15.2 task group [156] published
    standards for the coexistence of WPAN with other wireless networks. However, raising
    awareness of the new techniques and technologies do not solve the entire coexistence
    issue. The problem of coexistence among BR/EDR, BLE, IEEE 802.15.4, and IEEE 802.11
    networks is causing major difficulties in terms of delay and power consumption
    in IoT networks. The issue of coexistence has gotten further momentum due to the
    fact the emerging standards like WirelessHART, ISA100.11a, and IEEE 802.15.4e
    share the same license-exempted ISM band, resulting in the 2.4 GHz frequency band
    being more crowded. Due to the massive proliferation of IEEE 802.15.4 and IEEE
    802.11 networks, the possibility of interference would deteriorate application-specific
    QoS parameters. These networks exist in large numbers today and operate in close
    proximity to a number of application domains. Suitable interference avoidance
    solutions need to be adapted in order to maintain the required service. As presented
    in Figure 9 the different wireless technologies operating in the 2.4 GHz band.
    In Figure 9(a), BR/EDR is operating between 2402 MHz to 2480 MHz. It divides the
    frequency into 79 (1 MHz wide) channels and uses AFH to avoid collisions. Figure
    9(b) shows BLE, which has 40 channels that are 2 MHz wide and also uses AFH. The
    only difference is that the advertising channels (specified with the gray color)
    have the responsibility of initiating the connection in connectable mode, and
    they are not involved in the frequency hopping. As mentioned in Table 4, to achieve
    longer coverage, the maximum transmit power in BLE 5 is increased from 10 dBm
    to 20 dBm, compared to the earlier version of BLE. Figure 9(c) shows channel assignment
    for the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. Channels from 1 to 10 for the 868 – 868.6 MHz
    and 902 – 928 MHz bands are defined for lower frequency ranges, whereas the channels
    from 11 to 26 are operating in 2.4 GHz band. Each channel is 2 MHz wide, and the
    center of each channel is 5 MHz apart. Figure 9(d) depicts the channel assignment
    of the IEEE 802.11b standard in the US. There are 11 channels, each 22 MHz wide.
    These channels overlap with each other, and in the best case scenario, we can
    only have three non-overlapping channels: channel 1, 6, and 11. However, the IEEE
    802.11 standards have several versions, and the channel assignment differs in
    some countries. A. Coexistence of IEEE 802.15.4 and IEEE 802.11 IEEE 802.11, more
    widely known as WiFi, is the ubiquitous technology defining standards for WLANs.
    Today, WiFi devices are everywhere, and they are causing severe interference with
    IEEE 802.15.4 networks. Unlike IEEE 802.15.4 devices, IEEE 802.11 devices operate
    at a high transmit power, high data rate, and long range. Since they are unable
    to sense IEEE 802.15.4 devices, they create strong interference with them. In
    terms of channel bandwidth, both IEEE 802.15.4 and IEEE 802.11 channels are asymmetric,
    i.e., each IEEE 802.15.4 and IEEE 802.11 channel has bandwidth 5 MHz and 22 MHz,
    respectively. This causes overlapping of the four IEEE 802.15.4 channels, as shown
    in Figure 9. In most cases, IEEE 802.15.4 is vulnerable to interference [157],
    however, in certain cases, it does cause interference [158]. In order to improve
    network performance and support coexistence, these technologies inherently utilize
    specific techniques that help to promote coexistence. For example, IEEE 802.15.4
    employs a number of inherent mechanisms such as DSSS, CSMA/CA, CCA, low transmit
    power, low duty cycle, channel alignment, ED, and LQI as explained in Section
    III. DSSS promotes coexistence and protects against interference by spreading
    the signal to a wider frequency through chipping code. Chipping code is achieved
    by mapping the bit pattern of the signal into a higher data rate bit sequence.
    As the signal is spread over a larger bandwidth, the narrowband interferer blocks
    a small overall percentage of the signal. The receiver is able to easily recover
    the signal [159]. CSMA/CA works on a “listen before talk” principle, where the
    transmitting devices PHY continuously samples the channel and notifies the receiving
    device when it is clear to transmit. In this way, it is less likely to cause collision
    and interference with other signals. The radio turnaround time for IEEE 802.15.4
    is 192 μs , while the turnaround time of the DIFS (Distributed Interframe Space)
    of IEEE 802.11 is 50 μs . This can cause IEEE 802.11 devices to easily preempt
    the channel access while the IEEE 802.15.4 device is still in the process of radio
    state switching. Acknowledged transmission and retries further ensure reliability,
    where the receiver acknowledges a successful data reception. If the receiver does
    not send an ACK in a stipulated time, the sender assumes failure and retransmits
    data by using its retry limit. This can be particularly useful when the IEEE 802.15.4
    device is encountering interference when coexisting with Bluetooth. Bluetooth
    may interfere with the first transmission, but then it would hop to another channel.
    A retry helps the IEEE 802.15.4 device to make a successful transmission on the
    second attempt. However, studies in [160] show that the timing mechanism employed
    in CCA mechanism of IEEE 802.15.4 is much longer than that of IEEE 802.11 b/g,
    and it causes IEEE 802.15.4 to be in an adverse situation in terms of channel
    access competition. IEEE 802.15.4e TSCH mode uses channel hopping to promote coexistence.
    Every transmission happens on a different channel. This helps to further counter
    the effects of interference from other co-located networks. Likewise, WirelessHART
    utilizes channel hopping in combination with channel blacklisting to deal with
    interference effectively. With this method, a channel that is continuously causing
    transmission problems is eliminated from the list of available channels. ISA100.11a
    employs adaptive frequency hopping using slow hopping, fast hopping, and a hybrid
    combination of both. Although these techniques avoid interference to some extent,
    the rising penetration of these networks in different domains prompts the need
    for more advanced and sound interference avoidance techniques in order to help
    these technologies coexist constructively. Especially for mission critical applications,
    the issue of interference in a coexisting environment becomes more challenging
    due to the real-time characteristics of these applications which always require
    bounded latency and high throughput. The issue of coexistence between IEEE 802.15.4
    and IEEE 802.11a/b/g has been discussed in [157], [158], and [160]. For instance,
    in [160], it is shown how severely an IEEE 802.11 network can interfere with an
    IEEE 802.15.4 network and degrade its performance. This performance degradation
    can lead to adverse consequences for application QoS requirements. For example,
    consider a fire detection application based on IEEE 802.15.4. If there is a substantial
    packet loss due to massive IEEE 802.11 interference, the fire extinguisher may
    not trigger within the set latency bounds, leading to catastrophic consequences.
    Angrisani et al. [155] experimentally studied the coexistence of ZigBee and WLAN.
    The experiment was conducted by varying different characteristics, such as packet
    size, packet rate, and SINR, under different topologies. The authors confirmed
    that ZigBee and WLAN could coexist but to the detriment of packet loss rate and
    throughput. Guo et al. [161] conducted experimental tests to assess the interference
    from an IEEE 802.11 transmitter, Bluetooth transmitter, and microwave ovens sources
    on the link reliability of IEEE 802.15.4 devices. Through their results, the authors
    show that these interference sources (ISs) cause significant packet error rate
    (PER). The value of PER varies from 2% with no IS to an upward 25% depending upon
    the distance between receiver, transmitter, and IS. B. Coexistence of Bluetooth
    With Other Wireless Technologies After version 1.2, Bluetooth employed AFH with
    the pseudo-random FH technique. As random frequency hopping suffered from certain
    complications, such as repeating the transmission in busy channels. Pust and Burda
    [162] performed a comparison between the FH and AFH mathematical models and proved
    that AFH has a better performance in avoiding interference. The basic idea of
    AFH is to classify the channels as good or bad channels. Nodes are only allowed
    to transmit in good channels. To avoid interference, AFH restricts transmission
    on busy channels by labeling them as bad channels. Transmission in a good channel
    helps Bluetooth to establish a reliable connection and leave busy channels for
    other technologies. However, the number of channels should not be less than a
    specific number. Otherwise, the good channels would be more sensitive to interference.
    For example, in BR/EDR, the good channels can be reduced down to only 20 channels
    [163]. In AFH the device is not aware of the other devices and their transmission
    status. In order to identify the traffic condition in a channel for classification,
    there are two main methods: Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) and the
    Packet Error Rate (PER) [164]. Channel noise is one of the factors which has an
    impact on signal strength. In the RSSI technique, the receiver side measures the
    signal strength and informs the transmitter about the channel condition. On the
    other hand, in PER, the transmitter measures channel noise based on the number
    of lost packets. In order to update the channel map, the validity of classification
    needs to be checked periodically. Apart from all of the benefits of the AFH, there
    are also disadvantages to its use. For instance, in order to check the channel
    quality over time, AFH has to periodically scan and classify the channels, which
    increases the duty cycle. Moreover, reducing the number of available channels
    may cause more sensitivity to interference. Lee and Lee [165] simulated packet
    delivery ratio performance in BR/EDR by combining AFH and adaptive transmit power.
    They considered an environment with IEEE 802.11b and a number of BR/EDR piconets.
    They compared the proposed method with the basic AFH in term of interference mitigation
    in different distances. They showed that adaptively controlling the transmit power
    significantly decreases the PER. Another study in [166] analyzed the impact of
    interference of other sources on BLE and ZigBee. The authors monitored the power
    consumption of BLE and ZigBee and showed that BLE is more energy efficient in
    terms of the number of transmitted bytes per Joule. The study presented in [167]
    tested the performance of BLE. They analyzed the probability of BLE network failure
    in different environments and presence of interference. The results showed that,
    with the use of AFH, BLE has a lower probability of failure even in high interference.
    Bronzi et al. [168] presented the application of BLE for robust Inter-vehicular
    communications. They examined the impact of IEEE 802.11g on BLE. The experimental
    results showed that BLE can be a reliable solution when compared to IEEE 802.11p
    if the high data rate is not required. The performance of the advertisement channels
    in BLE was analyzed in [136]. Based on the experiment, in a dense environment,
    authors claimed that when multiple devices are scanning in the same channels,
    it is not feasible to increase packet size to above 31 bytes for the advertisement
    channel. C. Other Sources of Interference Microwave ovens use electromagnetic
    waves in the 2.4 GHz band. Although they are covered by a Faraday cage, there
    is still some leakage that occurs around the doors. These waves increase the motion
    in water molecules and heat up food [169]. According to the US Department of Energy
    (DOE), more than 90% of houses have microwave ovens [170]. They also share the
    same spectrum and cause interference for networking devices based on WLAN, Bluetooth,
    and IEEE 802.15.4. Microwave ovens normally generate 60 dBm signal power and operate
    in a different range in 2.4 GHz (model dependent). Results show that the radiation
    from microwave ovens that operate in the vicinity of WSN networks can cause up
    to 92% packet loss [171] in WSN. This increases further interference for wireless
    networking devices in the 2.4 GHz band. Kim et al. [160] investigated the coexistence
    of WLAN and ZigBee networks in the presence of microwave ovens. The experimental
    results show that the microwave oven is a dominant interferer and it significantly
    increases ZigBee’s PER. Rondeau et al. [172] analyzed the characteristics of microwave
    ovens and their effect on BR/EDR. The experimental results show that the AFH mechanism
    enables BR/EDR to be able to tolerate a high level of interference at a distance
    of one meter. Cordless phones are available almost everywhere. Most of them operate
    in the 2.4 GHz band like microwave ovens. They use DSSS or FHSS to overcome interference
    and achieve better voice quality. Generally, the DSSS method changes the channel
    manually, while the FHSS method automatically changes the channel. Similar to
    microwave ovens, the frequency range and the technique used in these devices are
    model dependent, and there is no global standard for them. SECTION VI. Z-wave
    Z-wave is a low-power wireless technology that is specifically designed for control
    applications in residential areas. It supports full mesh networking. The technology
    was developed by Zensys, which is a company for home automation applications such
    as Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC), Smart Lighting Control (SLC)
    and access control [173]. The main feature of the Z-wave technology is that it
    operates in the sub-1 GHz band, which allows the signal to avoid any interference
    with the 2.4 GHz working technologies. Moreover, it has the advantage of full
    interoperability with other z-wave enabled devices compared to other wireless
    technologies. This means regardless of product type, brand and manufacturer all
    Z-wave devices are able to join one network and help grow the mesh network. For
    example, a BLE enabled thermostat from one company might not connect to BLE smart
    sensor with other brand but in the Z-wave network, all the devices are cooperating
    with one another. The standard is proprietary and is available under a non-disclosure
    agreement. The point-to-point communication range between nodes is about 30 meters.
    The PHY layer in Z-wave is designed for remote control applications, where most
    of their requirements are just a single end-to-end message. For example, turning
    on and off a light requires a very low data rate. The technology operates in the
    908.42 MHz band in the US and the 868.42 MHz band in Europe, employing the Frequency
    Shift Keying (FSK) modulation. By operating in this band, Z-wave avoids collision
    in 2.4 GHz frequency band. The radio has a data rate of up to 40 kbit/s [174].
    In the MAC layer, Z-wave uses the CSMA/CA. The re-transmission technique is based
    on ACKs. There are two types of Z-wave devices: controller and slaves. The controller
    has the responsibility of initiating the control commands and sending them to
    other nodes. On the other hand, slave nodes are responsible for replying and executing
    the commands. It is also possible for the slave to forward the command to other
    nodes. A Z-wave network can support 232 nodes, including multiple controllers
    [175]. The controller node, which creates the Z-wave network, becomes the primary
    controller. There is only one central controller in a Z-wave network. The other
    controllers are the secondary controllers. Controllers can communicate with all
    the slaves. However, just the primary controller can add and remove the nodes
    from the network. Aside from the controller, there are some slave nodes in a Z-wave
    network that are only responsible for performing an action or routing the controller’s
    messages. SECTION VII. 802.11AH WLAN is a worldwide available technology. However,
    this technology suffers from a limited range and high power consumption, which
    are key elements in IoT. In October 2013, IEEE P802.11-TASK GROUP AH [176] provided
    the standard specification over WLAN to overcome these limitations. In the specification,
    MAC and PHY are inherited from IEEE 802.11ac. Additionally, sub-1 GHz frequency
    operation is added to provide better coverage, obstacle penetration, and lower
    power consumption. As explained in Section V, most of the wireless technologies
    opt for operating in the unlicensed 2.4 GHz band. This makes the frequency band
    more and more crowded. Operating in sub-1 GHz is an advantage for IEEE 802.11ah
    to avoid interferes in the 2.4 GHz frequency band. On the other hand, while technologies
    such as Bluetooth and ZigBee are targeting WPAN, IEEE 802.11ah aims for up to
    1 km coverage to be used for applications in Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN).
    Adaptation of IEEE 802.11ah in smart homes, wearables, agriculture monitoring,
    animal tracking, industrial automation, and smart cities eliminates many existing
    wireless communication limitations. For example, a smartwatch can directly communicate
    with an IEEE 802.11ah Access Point (AP) to transmit the information without needing
    to connect to a smartphone, or a single AP in a smart building can manage all
    the connected devices. A. PHY Layer As discussed above, IEEE 802.11ah, like IEEE
    802.11ac, employs Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) modulation
    in order to achieve high throughput and more extended coverage among low-power
    wireless networks. The difference between IEEE 802.11ac and IEEE 802.11ah is that
    the channel widths are ten times clocked down. Instead of 20, 40, 80, and 160
    MHz in IEEE 802.11ac, IEEE 802.11ah uses 2, 4, 8, and 16 MHz in addition to an
    extra 1 MHz channel to extend the range. The 1 MHz and 2 MHz bandwidths are intended
    for applications that require low data rates and power, such as WSN. Furthermore,
    a new modulation and coding scheme, MCS10, has been designed for the 1 MHz channel.
    MCS10 is more reliable than the other modulation and coding schemes, and it can
    provide a coverage range up to 1 km. However, employing all the channels in different
    regions is not possible because of the licensing limitations. Table 5 shows the
    global available unlicensed bands in sub-1 GHz with Emitted Radiated Power (ERP)
    and Channel Bandwidth (CBW) [178]. TABLE 5 Worldwide Availability of IEEE 802.11ah
    Frequency Range [177] B. MAC Layer The IEEE 802.11ah MAC layer is designed to
    support scalability while keeping the power consumption low. Theoretically, the
    standard is able to support up to 6000 nodes. In order to support this amount
    of connected nodes to a single AP, IEEE 802.11ah uses the Restricted Access Window
    (RAW) mechanism. An AP defines RAW by first grouping the clients. The RAW is a
    time slot assigned to a group and the AP. The group is only allowed to communicate
    in that specified time slot window. In each group, nodes are competing for channel
    access. Up to 64 slots are supported [179]. In addition, IEEE 802.11ah introduced
    Target Wake Time (TWT) to save power. TWT assigns access time to the clients that
    need to wake up and access the channel. Clients and the AP exchange information
    about the channel access time and connection duration. SECTION VIII. LoRa LoRa
    is a radio frequency transmission method for wide area network applications. It
    was developed by Cycleo of Grenoble and acquired by Semtech [180]. It is a low-power
    and low data rate technology that covers up to 10 kilometers for wireless communication.
    It operates in the sub-1 GHz spectrum and follows the previously mentioned unlicensed
    band for every region in the world (see Table 5). The frequency band is divided
    into 8 or 15 channels, depending on the operation region. The transmission power
    is limited from 2 to 14 dBm in Europe and from 5 to 20 dBm in the U.S. LoRa has
    three bandwidth classes for communication: 125, 250, and 500 KHz. Although high
    bandwidth has the advantage of high data rate, it consumes more energy, reduces
    the communication range, and increases the possibility of interference due to
    operating in the broader spectrum. In LoRa, modulation is based on spread-spectrum
    techniques and a variation of Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS). In particular, it has
    the spreading factor (SF) of 7 to 12, which represents the number of bits encoded
    per symbol. The larger SF increases the transmission range in the expanse of higher
    power consumption. The CSS does not distinguish the noise in the channel like
    DSSS or AFH, but it has the advantage of using the entire allocated bandwidth,
    making it resistant to channel noise, Doppler effect, and multi-path fading. Normally,
    FSK modulations can only detect signals that are 8 to 10 dB above the noise floor,
    however, using CSS features enables the LoRa to detect signals that are 19.5 dB
    below the noise floor. Together with CSS LoRa uses FEC for error correction with
    the code rate of 4/5, 4/6, 4/7, and 4/8 to increase the robustness of the channel.
    More redundancy bits for error correction helps to extend the range and robustness
    of the link by recovering the corrupted bits that are caused by path loss or interference.
    However, the overhead consumes more energy. The LoRa network architecture uses
    the star-of-stars topology, which consists of end nodes and gateways. End nodes
    are usually battery powered devices and act as slave devices, while gateways are
    potent devices that are connected to AC power source and are responsible for collecting
    the data from the end nodes. In the LoRa network, several gateways can receive
    the information that is transmitted by the end node, and multiple receptions increase
    the reliability of the network. Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) is a layer
    on top of the LoRa that defines roles for communication introduced by the LoRa
    Alliance [181]. It is one of the most adopted, low-power wireless technologies
    for low data rate and long-range connectivity. It has advantages over cellular
    technologies, since cellular technologies are battery hungry and not suitable
    for low-power applications. For example, a soil moisture sensor in agricultural
    monitoring needs to sense the humidity level every few days, and the battery has
    to last for a few years. LoRaWAN extended the network functionality by adding
    a network server and defining different device classes for each application. The
    network server is responsible for managing the communication, filtering the multiple
    copies from one packet received by different gateways and scheduling the communication.
    For example, the network server decides the gateway that should communicate with
    certain end nodes and when to change the data rate. LoRaWAN has a bidirectional-employing
    adaptive data rate and transmission power. This adaptive control optimizes the
    power consumption and performance of the network. As presented in Figure 17 LoRaWAN
    has three device classes that are specified for each application. Class A is the
    default class and uses pure ALOHA to access the link for transmission. In this
    class, the end node wakes up periodically and transmits a packet. Then, it waits
    for the downlink to respond in the same channel and the same SF. If it does not
    receive the packet, it waits for the second packet in a different frequency and
    with different SF. After receiving a response from the gateway, the end node switches
    to sleep mode. On the gateway side, the device is only able to transmit information
    once, exactly after receiving the packet from the end node. Therefore, if the
    gateway needs to send more than one packet, it has to wait for hours or days to
    send the next packet in the queue. This class has the advantage of having the
    lowest power consumption due to the extended sleep period. Meanwhile, it is not
    suitable for real-time applications. This class is mostly used for non-critical
    sensors with long battery life requirements. Class B is designed for applications
    with more frequent connectivity requirements compared to class A. This class is
    a combination of class A and C. Devices in this class wake up whenever the gateways
    have information to transmit. A beacon that is transmitted by the gateway schedules
    the wake-up time for the end node. Frequent access ensures the connection establishment
    when it is required, however, the overhead due to the beacons and the frequent
    wake-up time reduces the battery life. Valves for irrigation are one of the examples
    of uses cases for devices in this class. Class C is normally implemented in devices
    that are connected to an AC power source, where energy consumption is not a concern.
    In this class, devices are continuously listening to the channel, except when
    they are transmitting information. Therefore, they are ideal for real-time applications.
    Devices such as street lights that are connected to the AC power are an example
    of this class and can act as gateways as well. FIGURE 17. LoRaWAN communication
    classes. Show All SECTION IX. Applications In this section, we present an overview
    of the important IoT applications in the home, healthcare, industry, and city
    domain. These applications utilize different wireless technologies and standards.
    First, we summarize the requirements of each application and their traffic characteristics.
    Second, we discuss the suitability of each wireless standard pertaining to each
    type of application. We critically point out the standards that are suitable for
    each application category. Additionally, we identify the drawbacks of each standard
    based on the requirements of the applications. A. Smart Building The basic goal
    of a smart building is to provide a better living environment in order to make
    our life more comfortable and more efficient while also making it safer and pleasant.
    It is reported that we spend more than 87% of our time in indoor environments,
    including home and commercial buildings [182]. In 2016, the global market for
    smart homes was valued at 39.93billionandpredictedtoreachupto 79.57 billion by
    2022 with a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 11.3% [183]. However, the concept
    of the smart building is not only about controlling lights or other devices with
    voice commands or a simple point to point remote control. The main idea is to
    have an Ambient Intelligence (AmI) using M2M communication in order for a device
    in the building to make smart decisions based on real-time conditions [184]. According
    to Gartner, a typical family home will have 500 smart devices by 2022 [185]. This
    future requires a scalable wireless technology. As we discussed in Section V,
    with the increasing number of smart objects that communicate with each other using
    the same frequency band, interference becomes a severe issue. Furthermore, issues
    related to Internet connectivity, mobility, availability, energy consumption,
    and reliability need to be addressed. There are many consumer-oriented IoT smart
    home applications. Some of the major use cases and their communication requirements
    are discussed below. One of the common use cases in buildings is Smart Lighting
    Control that provides more comfort and convenience for the owners and has a direct
    impact on saving cost and energy. The Gartner’s report estimated that SLC cloud
    reduce the energy cost by 90%, and its market will grow from 46 million units
    in 2015 to 2.54 billion units in 2020 [187]. SLCs are performed by employing relays,
    motion sensors, daylight sensors, timers, dimmers, and switches. In order to perform
    efficient wireless controlling for this hardware, it requires mobility and scalability.
    For example, a large number of lamps or LEDs may exist and need to be accessible
    from different locations of the building. The mesh networking capability can support
    these to increase the coverage. A person who is moving in the building must be
    able to access the lights. Another key use case is the privacy and safety of the
    buildings. A typical solution for providing safety in buildings is the use of
    video surveillance. However, many users are reluctant to surveillance cameras
    because of privacy concerns, installation costs, lack of real-time responses,
    power consumption issues, and massive storage requirements. A better alternative
    to video surveillance is to use low-cost and low-power sensors that are able to
    detect and perform actions immediately and prevent disasters. For example, in
    the case of a fire in the building, smoke detectors can reliably prevent hazardous
    situations in a promptly manner. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration,
    Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning is the largest contributor to the energy
    bills in a home. It contributes to 48% of the total energy consumption of U.S.
    homes [188]. In many cases, the cost of power consumption changes based on the
    operation hours. Consequently, load balance controlling systems can help in scheduling
    the operation during off-peak periods [189]. The benefits of using smart HVAC
    are not only limited to providing comfort and a pleasant environment, but they
    also have direct impacts on people’s well-being. Smart controlling of HVAC requires
    employing smart thermostats, control valves, heating and cooling coils, dampers,
    actuators, pumps, fans, and vents. In order to access HVAC from anywhere, the
    timers, sensors, and actuators are required to be connected to the Internet and
    support scalability. Interoperability is desirable among sensors and actuators
    from different vendors in order to collaboratively communicate to make decisions.
    For example, a central heating or cooling system must be able to collect information
    about window shades, humidity, temperature, or absence of residents. Entertainment
    is one of the more compelling applications in smart buildings and homes that covers
    the access of multimedia contents such as music and home theaters. These applications
    require high throughput for streaming audio and video contents on the go. Since
    these devices rely on batteries, they require low-power consumption. Figure 18
    shows the forecasting provided by ABI research for the future of wireless technologies
    in smart homes [190]. The numbers prove that technologies like WiFi and Bluetooth
    dual mode will have less share of the market, and low-power and low rate devices
    will be more desired. Table 6 summarizes the general requirements and shows the
    major technologies that support these requirements in smart buildings. A detailed
    discussion about smart building requirements is presented in [191]. TABLE 6 Smart
    Building Requirements and Available Technologies FIGURE 18. Comparison of major
    wireless technology demands for smart home predicted by 2018 (The CAGR is from
    2016 to 2021) (source: [186]). Show All FIGURE 19. Comparison of major Bluetooth
    applications market predicted by 2021 (source: [203]). Show All FIGURE 20. Comparison
    of major applications based on the number of connected devices in smart cites
    (source: [250]). Show All BR/EDR and BLE are available technologies in almost
    every smartphone, laptop, and tablet. This feature enables smart buildings to
    be controlled using these devices. Statistics show that nearly 73% of people would
    like to receive smartphone alerts from their home security system [192]. Compared
    to other low-power technologies, this availability along with lower-power consumption
    are advantages for BLE. As shown in Figure 18, it can be predicted that the BLE
    market will surpass other technologies. BLE’s AFH algorithm and usage of advertising
    channels have reduced interference with most of the common operating wireless
    technologies in the 2.4 GHz band, such as IEEE 802.11. This feature makes BLE
    a suitable option for an environment that is full of wireless devices that operate
    in that band. The aforementioned features also help to reduce battery consumption
    and provide reliability. By increasing the range up to four times more in Bluetooth
    5, the signals can cover an entire building. For example, the user is able to
    access the door lock from anywhere in the building. Another advantage of BLE is
    the recently added mesh networking feature, which increases the network scale,
    reliability, and coverage. Countless amounts of research has been done on Bluetooth
    applications in smart buildings [193]–[196]. For example, Putra et al. [197] compared
    the energy consumption of WiFi and BLE devices in smart home applications. The
    result showed the possibility of occupancy data transmission via BLE with 30%
    less battery consumption. Aside from academic publications on the application
    of BLE in smart buildings, there are some companies such as UniKey [198], BOLT
    [199], and Emerson [200] that are working on home automation devices based on
    Bluetooth. Beaconing is one of the unique features of BLE that is used in many
    applications, such as indoor positioning. For example, by tracking the users inside
    the building, the AmI can perform desired actions like turning on or off the lights
    or playing one’s favorite music [201]. As shown in the Figure 18, the Bluetooth
    beacon market will have the highest market compared to other Bluetooth-enabled
    technologies in 2021. While Bluetooth has its benefits, it does have some limitations
    that are associated with it. For example, there is a lack of scalability support
    in BR/EDR and IPv6 connectivity in both BLE and BR/EDR [202]. Incorporating other
    technologies with Bluetooth will increase the demand. ZigBee is another candidate
    for smart home applications. One of the major advantages of ZigBee is that as
    an open global wireless standard, it provides the open source software stack for
    developers to freely access the network and application layer. It employees mesh
    networking to eliminate the single point of failure and expand the reach of the
    network. Additionally, in the star topology in WLAN, sharing a single node between
    a large numbers of connected devices has the problem of increasing the delay in
    the entire network. The ZigBee network supports more than 400 connected nodes,
    which will be necessary for the future of smart homes, based on the Gartner report’s
    prediction. With mesh networking increasing the number of the devices, the robustness
    of the network is also increasing due to redundancy and decentralization [204].
    A self-organizing network is optimal for a more scalable network architecture
    that incorporates reliability and adaptivity. ZigBee enables a variety of smart
    home applications by connecting the sensors and actuators. Additionally, ZigBee
    is a low-power wireless standard that allows the battery to operate for several
    years. It can also run without a battery by utilizing harvested energy. For example,
    a keychain flashlight gets its power by a simple push of a button. Internet connectivity
    is one of the significant characteristics of an ideal wireless network for home
    automation applications. Although ZigBee natively does not support Internet connectivity
    in the protocol stack, the 6LoWPAN technology adopted the IPv6 connectivity based
    on the 802.15.4 standard [47]. This adoption allows the nodes to be independent
    of the translation gateway in order to access the Internet. Compared to Bluetooth,
    the main limitations of ZigBee-based smart buildings are the lack of support by
    smartphones and the low communication throughput. Similar to Bluetooth, there
    is an ample amount of research that has been done on the application of ZigBee
    in smart buildings [205] [206]. Zigbee also has products on the market that are
    used for smart building applications. Companies such as Control4 [207] and Phillips
    Hue [208] are designing their products based on ZigBee technology. Thread is a
    recently developed wireless technology targeted for home automation. It is IPv6
    enabled and supports mesh networking, thereby all devices can be addressed locally
    or globally. Mesh networking support allows the network to cover the entire building,
    and it improves the robustness of the network and avoids issues such as single
    point of failure. SLC is one of the main applications of a Thread network, and
    scalability is one of the requirements for the SLC applications. A Thread network
    supports up to 200 connected nodes. In addition, operating on MAC and PHY layers
    of IEEE 802.15.4 allows the technology to get the benefit of low-power consumption.
    In addition to Bluetooth and ZigBee, several proprietary standards target building
    automation applications. Standards such as Z-wave [209], INSTEON [210], and EnOcean
    are particularly designed to meet the requirements in home automation applications.
    Z-Wave specifically targets control applications such as SLC and access control.
    A thermostat is one of the examples of these applications and has over 2100 certified
    products. The products are supported by 600 companies like Intermatic [211], Hawking
    Technology [212], Wink [213], and Aeotec [214]. As previously mentioned in Section
    VI, Z-wave has the advantage of using the sub-1 GHz frequency band. However, this
    can also be a disadvantage when the products need to be distributed globally and
    used in other countries that have different rules for operating in the sub-1 GHz
    band. INSTEON Alliance was launched in 2005 by Smartlabs company [215]. The technology
    combined powerline and wireless mesh technology. Devices can support wireless
    technologies, wired technologies, or both. Wireless devices use FSK modulation
    and operate at 904 MHz with a data rate of 38.4 kb/s [216], [217]. INSTEON has
    applications in SLC, thermostats, smart sensors, and remote controls. EnOcean
    [218] is a wireless technology developed for smart homes and standardized by the
    international standard ISO/IEC 14543-3-10 [219]. It aims to use harvested power
    sources from the environment for wireless technology [220]. Devices such as smart
    plugs, SLC, and HVAC can be controlled by EnOcean. Like Z-wave and INSTEON, it
    operates in the sub-1 GHz band with a data rate of up to 125 kbps. B. Smart Healthcare
    Improving the health quality for individuals prompts a need to provide advanced
    systems for diagnosing, treating, and preventing diseases. A robust healthcare
    system can be divided into two generally classified categories: prevention of
    illness and post illness monitoring. Monitoring the blood pressure, Electrocardiogram
    (ECG), Electroencephalogram (EEG), Electromyogram (EMG), glucose level, cholesterol
    level, pulse oximetry, and toxins in the body can help early-stage detection in
    order to prevent fatal diseases, such as cancer or heart attacks [221]. The rapidly
    increasing population and longer life expectancies raise the importance of mechanisms
    for children and elderly health monitoring, artificial organ implementation and
    drug delivery. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), global life expectancy
    increased from 66.4 years in 2000 to 71.4 years in 2015 [222]. As the global life
    expectancy is increasing, the size of the geriatric population is also increasing.
    The number of people over 60 years old increased from 607 million to 901 million
    by a 48% increase. Also, it is predicted that by 2030, this number will grow by
    56% to 1.4 billion and reach to 2.1 billion in 2050 [223]. It is also clear that
    the risk of chronic diseases like neurological conditions, diabetes, heart diseases,
    and strokes increase with age. The other concern is the cost of healthcare, which
    can include hospitalization, home nursing, and medicines. It is estimated that
    in the U.S., healthcare expenses are more than $2 trillion annually [224]. This
    leads to the need to provide an advanced healthcare system for diagnosing, treating,
    and preventing disease. The desired system must be inexpensive, accessible, harmless,
    reliable, and must not restrict the daily activities, mobility, or quality of
    life. IoT, in combination with medical engineering, has the great potential to
    provide this system through wirelessly monitoring and recording medical data.
    Providing the Internet connectivity allows the physician to monitor the health
    condition of the patients. Thus, 41% of the IoT is marketed for healthcare applications
    by 2025 [228]. There are a large number of researchers who are focusing on the
    cure, prevention, and prediction of diseases using IoT and wireless technologies
    [229]–[232]. In IoT-based healthcare systems, smart homes can replace hospitals,
    and bulky, attached-to-the-body monitoring systems can be changed to tiny, implanted
    sensors. Table 7 shows the QoS requirements for a wireless network, including
    the data rate, timeliness, acceptable error rate, and required battery life. TABLE
    7 QoS Requirements for Smart Healthcare (Sources: [225]–[227]) It is important
    to provide a platform that does not limit the normal activities and quality of
    life of patients. For example, bulky attached sensors that are connected to wires
    are hard to carry and restrict the mobility of a patient [25]. Besides, providing
    Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) is important in monitoring health conditions. Smart
    homes or smart hospitals are examples of AAL. For instance, a smart home can receive
    the information from the wearable sensors of the patient in order to manage the
    temperature. Wireless sensors can be placed inside or outside of the body as wearables.
    These sensors can detect changes faster than highly equipped laboratories, especially
    for people who have a history of cancer or other diseases which can be inherited.
    However, this constant monitoring leads to high battery consumption. This increases
    the risk of nonavailability of these sensors in critical moments. Latency in bio-medical
    sensor applications is soft real time. Normally, in critical scenarios such as
    during a heart attack, a few seconds of latency is still acceptable. In [233],
    they implemented real-time and low-power ECG and EEG Bluetooth based sensors.
    They introduced the compressed sensing method, which saves the battery up to 37.1%
    more. In [234], the feasibility of applying dual mode Bluetooth in vital monitoring
    was analyzed. Authors implemented the ARM CPU based sensors, such as ECG, body
    temperature, and motion sensors. Reference [235] reviewed the available commercial
    Bluetooth-based healthcare devices in the market, which are composed of sensors
    such as activity tracking, ECG, EEG, EMG, and glucose monitoring. A BLE-based
    ECG monitoring using a smartphone is implemented in [236], and the result shows
    that power consumption is highly reduced. In addition to reducing power consumption,
    an equally important aspect of using sensors is that the patient is being continuously
    monitored in both indoor and outdoor locations like their home, hospital, and
    outside. Elderly patients are penitent when they feel that they are in danger
    and need to be continuously monitored. Reference [237] proposed a BLE-based indoor
    positioning system for patients who have Alzheimer. There are several commercial
    products like wearable devices on the market. Jawbone [238], Apple Watch [239],
    Samsung Gear [240] and most of the smartwatches are using Bluetooth and Wi-Fi
    technology to send the health sensor information. Heart rate monitoring with ECG,
    activity tracking, sleep monitoring, and other forms of health data are implemented
    in these wearables. However, Bluetooth is not the only low-power wireless technology
    for healthcare applications. ZigBee and 6LoWPAN are other candidates in this area.
    In [241] and [242], ZigBee-based ECG and pulse oximetry sensors are implemented
    by the authors, and the results showed that ZigBee meets the QoS requirements
    for these healthcare applications. Coexistence is also important in healthcare
    applications due to the WiFi-enabled smartphones that are operating close to the
    wireless technologies such as ZigBee. In [243], the impact of WiFi near the ZigBee
    wearables has been analyzed. Although 6LoWPAN and ZigBee share the same PHY and
    MAC, the IPv6 capability of 6LoWPAN makes the devices addressable via the Internet.
    This allows for the opportunity to remotely monitor health conditions or keep
    health records in the cloud. 6LoWPAN-based real-time health monitoring is proposed
    in [244]. They tested the performance of ECG monitoring sensor data for remote
    healthcare using a 6LoWPAN edge router. Doukas and Maglogiannis [245] presented
    the cloud platform in which sensors are connected to the Internet using 6LoWPAN
    technology. C. Industrial Automation During the last decade, wireless technology
    has been increasingly utilized in industries, leading to the Industrial Internet
    of Things (IIoT), where Industrial Wireless Sensor Networks (IWSNs) play a central
    role of behaving like a digital skin for the IoT. IWSNs can monitor critical parameters
    and control industrial processes and then inform the industrial personnel of this
    information promptly. IWSNs offer flexibility, self-organization, rapid deployment,
    and low-cost. They have the ability to make processes autonomous, resulting in
    the minimal human intervention [246] when compared to their wired counterpart.
    The shift from wired to the wireless networks dramatically helps to reduce huge
    capital expenditures of installation and maintenance of wires. Moreover, wired
    networks are rigid and fixed in nature. This makes it difficult to adapt to changes
    in industrial environments. In addition, certain industrial applications require
    mobile robots, which becomes a huge challenge with wired networks. However, wireless
    networks can easily support such mobility scenarios. Although IoT seems to revolutionize
    the industries, it is only if it satisfies the strict requirements and challenges
    that are put in place by the industrial applications. Such challenges include:
    extremely high reliability, low latency, robustness, fault tolerance, massive
    scalability, interoperability, and energy efficiency. Reliability against interference
    is highly indispensable because industries encompass several wireless networks,
    heavy machinery, and co-located communication systems that can interfere with
    IWSNs [246]. This can negatively impact wireless connectivity and result in link
    unreliability issues. Besides, most low-power wireless standards operate in the
    ISM band which can make them highly vulnerable to interference. Certain applications
    in industries, such as closed-loop control systems are extremely delaying sensitive.
    They tend to require low latency so that the control system can function smoothly.
    Furthermore, low power IWSNs have limited battery resources. When the devices
    run out of battery life and die, it leads to network failures. Therefore, the
    network needs to be fault tolerant so that failure of one device or a group of
    devices does not cause the entire network to fail. Scalability is also a challenge
    with wireless networks. The industries require dense networks that consist of
    hundreds and thousands of nodes. Efficient and fair distribution of limited resources
    in such dense networks causes trade-off complexities for several performance metrics.
    As time passes, certain devices and functionalities are removed, and new ones
    may be added. This requires the network to be scalable enough to accommodate such
    changes without compromising performance. Currently, wired networks are already
    prevalent in industries and used to support many processes and operations. The
    use of new wireless standards and solutions should seamlessly work with the legacy
    systems. This requires interoperability among the standards and solutions. Table
    8 shows the different classes of industrial applications, ranging from process
    monitoring, control, safety, and emergency operations as defined by ISA [37].
    The traffic categories are listed according to traffic priority with 0 as the
    highest priority traffic and 5 as the lowest priority traffic. Each application
    category generates a different kind of data traffic. In comparison to user-generated
    traffic on the Internet, the traffic generated by the industrial applications
    has different characteristics. TABLE 8 Different Classes of Industrial Applications
    as Defined by ISA Most of the processes in industries are periodic in nature,
    meaning that they do not require frequent data transmission. The long idle periods
    in between data transmission makes lower power networks more suitable in comparison
    to traditional cellular or next generation wireless networks. Essentially, the
    industrial environment is heterogeneous as shown in Table 9, i.e., certain traffic
    is an extremely high priority, while the other requires less priority. The high
    priority traffic requires immediate response to certain events, i.e., they need
    the right response at the right time, otherwise, the system can run into catastrophic
    situations. Below, we discuss some of the well-known low power standards and technologies
    developed over the years that promise to fulfill the requirements of industrial
    automation and help to realize IIoT. TABLE 9 Industrial Applications and Their
    Typical Requirements (Source: [18], [247]) 1) ZigBee ZigBee offers low power consumption.
    It supports several topologies that make it suitable for industrial monitoring
    and control. However, it is unable to provide high reliability and robustness
    [248]. ZigBee does not employ any frequency-agility protection against interference
    and fading effects. Moreover, the static nature of the channel will create a bottleneck
    for ZigBee communication if other wireless LANs operate in close proximity. This
    also impacts the delay and energy consumption because frequent packet losses will
    cause retransmissions, which will lead to an increase in delay and energy consumption.
    ZigBee uses IEEE 802.15.4 MAC, which renders the delay to be unbounded (cf Section
    III-C). This causes problems for real-time transmission, especially for control
    applications in process automation. 2) WirelessHART WirelessHART is developed
    to cater to monitoring and control in industries. It improves upon the drawbacks
    of ZigBee. The standard is robust and provides secure communication by implementing
    features such as channel hopping and channel blacklisting in order to avoid interference.
    In the case of transmission failures, retransmission occurs on a different channel.
    This improves reliability in harsh industrial environments. It supports mesh networking
    together with graph routing, which offers path redundancy and self-healing features
    that help in case of broken links [248]. The MAC protocol works on TDMA and provides
    multiple features, as discussed in Section 7. The standard employs a dedicated
    security manager, which implements the necessary encryption and security policies.
    Although WirelessHART is suitable in many aspects compared to ZigBee, it lacks
    public key encryption and the ability to connect to other networks without a gateway
    [249]. 3) IEEE 802.15.4E IEEE 802.15.4e defines six MAC modes. In particular,
    its TSCH MAC mode is important because it implements a deterministic TDMA mechanism
    and has channel hopping features in order to avoid the inevitable interference.
    The MAC protocol is multi-channel and offers many improvements as discussed in
    Section III-E3. Although TSCH offers high reliability for industrial automation,
    it lacks a scheduling entity to compute the schedule of nodes based on the traffic
    requirements of the application. TSCH defines the schedule, but how the schedule
    is built and maintained is unknown. Furthermore, 6TiSCH and 6LoWPAN standards
    emerged in order to provide an IP network that is capable of enabling low-power
    wireless standards as discussed in Section III-G and Section III-H, respectively.
    In this way, they promote interoperability among the latest and the traditional
    IP networks. D. Smart City The concept of a smart city envisions a city where
    information and communication technologies offer viable solutions to collect,
    analyze, and smartly distributes information in order to transform the services
    offered to the citizens, enhance operational efficiency, and help the public administration
    make better decisions [251], [252]. One of the promising projects for a smart
    city is the Smart Santander Project [50], conducted in the Spanish port city,
    Santander. It proposes a smart city where sensors, actuators, cameras, and screens
    are deployed around the city to help citizens better utilize information [253].
    The smart city promises to manage and optimize the plethora of public services,
    such as monitoring structural health, air quality and noise, as well as traffic
    management, smart parking, managing city energy consumption, waste management,
    smart lighting, and the automation of public buildings [254]. This vision can
    be realized by utilizing the telecommunication infrastructure, as well as several
    technologies like as WSN, M2M, and Vehicular to Vehicular (V2V) communication.
    A smart city integrates several emerging technologies with existing information
    and communication infrastructure in order to exhibit the successful evolution
    of IoT. The environment is heterogeneous, i.e., it encompasses different types
    of devices and generates different types of data traffic. Such an environment
    vastly depends on the networking connectivity, which demands high reliability,
    availability, low latency, and, at the same time, satisfies the requirements of
    all levels of applications. The major barrier is the interoperability among the
    several heterogeneous technologies to be able to work together to achieve a common
    goal. In such a scenario, providing reliable connectivity is a huge challenge
    not only because of the coexistence of a large number of devices that comply with
    different technologies but also because these devices can face severe interference.
    In such scenarios, impaired network connectivity can result in catastrophic situations
    for the wide variety of offered services and applications. In looking at the requirements
    that are defined by the smart cities, low-power standards, such as ZigBee, Bluetooth,
    IEEE 802.11ah, NFC, and Z-Wave, can fulfill their demands, but they are unable
    to provide high throughput and extended transmission range [255]. Furthermore,
    the advanced technologies, such as 3GPP, WiMAX, LTE, and LTE-Advanced, are not
    suitable due to their high power consumption because most of the smart city applications
    require small sensors that will be deployed everywhere and run on batteries. In
    order to realize the smart city concepts, low-power standards have to promote
    interoperability. A massive number of devices will be installed and need to work
    together efficiently, so scalable protocols are necessary. SECTION X. Related
    Surveys There exist various survey papers that discuss the characteristics, technologies,
    standards, and applications of IoT [21], [256]–[259]. Unfortunately, these studies
    did not cover the recent wireless technologies and their suitability for each
    IoT application. In particular, a comprehensive study on MAC and PHY layers in
    these technologies is missing. A recent study in [257] focuses on exploring the
    network architectures of IoT. The authors discuss the classification of IoT architectures
    and outline future architectural requirements. However, the paper does not cover
    aspects such as low-power standardization or well-known infrastructure protocols
    for IoT. Another survey in [21] provides an excellent, holistic discussion of
    IoT with respect to its architecture, common standards, elements, technologies,
    infrastructure protocols, applications, and market opportunities. It is more of
    a general overview of the various aspects of IoT, however, it does not cover the
    in-depth technical details, pitfalls, and limitations of MAC protocols of low-power
    standards. The survey paper in [258] provides a sound analysis of recent advances
    in IoT. The authors focus the paper on the standardized protocol stack and examine
    the IETF standardization efforts and protocols. The paper provides a profound,
    technical discussion on the application, MAC, routing and transport layers, as
    well as low-power radio characteristics. However, it does not cover their applicability
    and limitations in different IoT application domains. The IoT survey paper in
    [256] examines the IETF current standards and protocols and explores open questions,
    limitations, opportunities, and future challenges. However, it discusses only
    the defacto standards. Besides, some surveys focus on a single IoT application
    and its requirements as well as the suitability of each wireless technology for
    it. For example, Yuehong et al. [229] explored the application of IoT in health
    care. The study provides a general overview of a system architecture for IoT-based
    smart health care. It is a general overview, and the specific requirements for
    applications are not mentioned. Similarly, Domingo [260] studied the research
    trend to improve the quality of life for individuals with disabilities. The study
    shows the possible solutions to overcome the limitations of some disabilities
    by using connected sensors and positioning technologies. The adaptability of optimal
    wireless technology for each scenario has been reviewed as well. The study lacks
    a larger pool of individuals and ignores the challenge of providing a low-power
    network. In [261] WBANs for medical and non-medical applications have been reviewed.
    The authors explained the uniqueness of this network because of the high mobility
    and placement of some sensors inside the human body. The scope of this is limited
    to the WBANs, and challenges, such as the coexistence of the wireless network,
    have not been taken into consideration. As was mentioned earlier, smart homes
    are another potential application of IoT. Alaa et al. [262] reviewed the research
    trend focusing on IoT-based smart homes. The study helps researchers to find out
    the challenges and demands of the desired smart homes. However, the study only
    classifies the number of researchers and directions and does not explain the technical
    specifications. The study in [204] only focuses on home automation. Raza et al.
    [263] reviewed the LPWAN for long-range communication networks such as SigFox
    and LoRaWAN. They explained the available technologies of these networks and applications.
    Due to the operation of LPWAN in the sub-1 GHz frequency and the requirement of
    having a different unlicensed band for every country, these technologies are not
    able to operate globally. In contrast with single application surveys, some other
    reviews only explain a single wireless technology. For instance, Gomez et al.
    [107] and Darroudi and Gomez [264] review the BLE standard from a protocol stack
    point of view and research to provide a BLE mesh network, respectively. On the
    other hand, surveys like [67], [265], and [266] only focus on IEEE 802.15.4 based
    standards. Blanckenstein et al. [267] reviewed low-power transceivers and suitability
    for each application. However, due to the novelty of technologies like BLE 5,
    they did not cover the latest transceivers. Additionally, the survey only reviews
    the hardware requirements for low-power networks. SECTION XI. Conclusion Emerging
    IoT applications impose several constraints in terms of reliability, timeliness,
    scalability, and energy efficiency. The purpose of our study was to provide a
    thorough discussion about existing low-power wireless standards, technologies,
    and protocols, and examine their suitability in diverse IoT application domains.
    We presented the requirements of different applications such as smart healthcare,
    industrial automation, and smart cities, and analyzed the potentials of existing
    standards in meeting such requirements. Our survey focused on the PHY and MAC
    layers because they directly influence the aforementioned constraints. In our
    attempt to explore their suitability, we highlighted several drawbacks of the
    MAC protocols. We also discussed the interference issue among the coexisting,
    low-power wireless networks, which is a major challenge that degrades the network
    performance for reliability and latency. We analyzed how the inherent schemes
    employed by the standards cope with the interference issues. Lastly, we presented
    the application domains of the IoT and the requirements for each scenario. Additionally,
    we introduced the optimal wireless solution for each application based on the
    demands. ACKNOWLEDGMENT (Ali Nikoukar and Saleem Raza contributed equally to this

    \ market \nof this century, successfully running a business \nmeans to be able\
    \ to take advantage of the most \nadvanced techniques and technologies available,\
    \ \nachieving, by their appropriate integration \nwith more classical approaches,\
    \ a maximum of \nefficiency. Information Technologies (IT), control \nand communication\
    \ tools may offer extremely \nimportant opportunities, but they usually are \n\
    not very open for non-professionals, as business \ndecision-makers are.\nCyber-Physical\
    \ Systems, that represent the \nnext generation paradigm for engineering \nsystems,\
    \ are more and more effectively being \nadopted in industry, being expected to\
    \ offer the \nmeans for modelling, managing and connecting \nheterogeneous systems\
    \ [7, 15]. \nIn this context, there is a need for a generic \nframework allowing\
    \ the design of enterprise \narchitectures that can tightly couple business and\
    \ \nproduction models, as well as the capability to \nextend towards complex business\
    \ systems – which \nrepresents the main objective of this paper.\nThe paper is\

    \ of research and \ndevelopment in the area of ICT. An intensive work has been\
    \ concentrated in different domains, such as: Internet of Things, \nInternet of\
    \ Services and lately in the domain of Cyber Physical Systems whose important\
    \ driver is represented by the large-\nscale integration of the physical and cyber\
    \ worlds. Authors propose a Generic System Architecture, taking into account the\
    \ \nparadigm of Cyber-Physical Systems with a main emphasis on the future agricultural\
    \ enterprise (intelligent/smart farm) as a \ncomplex system, addressing sustainability\
    \ and adaptability towards environmental and market changes.\nKeywords: Cyber\

    \ Farm.\ninformation routing. The framework provides \na unified view, integrating\
    \ modelling and \nmanagement from business level to production \nlevel with the\
    \ aid of Cyber Physical Systems \nprinciples. Section five addresses a case study\
    \ \nrelated to the implementation of the proposed \nframework in the field of\
    \ agricultural enterprises [9].\n2. Cyber-Physical Systems – A \nMultidisciplinary\
    \ Vision\n2.1 Cyber-Physical Systems Principles and \nParadigms\nCyber-Physical\
    \ Systems represent an integration \nof computation and physical systems. The\
    \ focus \nof such systems is to bring together the actual \nphysical objects and\
    \ the omnipresent computing \nand networking systems. CPS are concerned with \n\
    the actual interaction between the physical and \ncomputer systems, thus completing\
    \ the up to \ndate research for understanding of the systems \nseparately [5].\n\
    An important paradigm in close relation to CPS \nis the Internet of Things (IoT)\
    \ which emphasizes \nthe use of existing technologies and architectures \nfor\
    \ large-scale systems in order to identify and \nvirtualize physical devices.\
    \ Internet of Things \ncomponents include: IoT Device Management, \nIoT Analytics,\
    \ IoT Security, Event Stream \nProcessing, IoT Platforms, IoT Standards and \n\
    Ecosystems to create a real intelligent integrated \nsystem [6].\nStudies in Informatics\
    \ and Control 26 (3) 325-334, September 2017\nhttps://doi.org/10.24846/v26i3y201708\n\
    http://www.sic.ici.ro\n326\nAnother important emerging paradigm is Industrie \n\
    4.0, which [1, 22] specifically takes into account: \nsensor and actuator networks,\
    \ intelligent network \ncontrol systems and human in the loop principles; \nIntelligent\
    \ Robots and Machines, including \nhuman-robot interaction, adaptive control,\
    \ \ncontext awareness; Big Data; Network Quality of \nService; Energy Efficiency\
    \ And Decentralization; \nVirtual Industrialization in regard to the concept \n\
    of “virtual plants and products”; Value Networks \naiming at achieving digital\
    \ integration along the \nsupply chain and along different manufacturing \nprocesses\
    \ and engineering models and  \nmethods [7, 18].\nIn this context, embedded systems\
    \ that control \nphysical processes can be viewed as a sub-set of \nthe wider\
    \ CPS definition.\nAn enterprise can be characterized as a complex \nsystem in\
    \ a state of relatively stable equilibrium \namong many interdependent component\
    \ systems \nin a shared human endeavour. In this context, the \nIntelligent Cyber\
    \ Enterprise may represent the \nnext generation of enterprises [7,8].\nIntelligent\
    \ Cyber-Physical Systems (ICPS) \nrepresent the next generation of advanced \n\
    networked systems, presenting distributed \nintelligence. Internet of Things and\
    \ Internet \nof Services, integrated by multiple feedback \nloops, allow to develop\
    \ complex cyber-physical  \nsystems [8]. \nAs presented in Figure 1, CPS evolve\
    \ from \ncomplex interactions of embedded systems \n(controls on board vehicles,\
    \ smart intersections, \ncommunication networks, etc.), based on the \nnetworking\
    \ and integration of them and involving \nhuman-technology interaction in application\
    \ \nprocesses [15, 23].\nFigure 1. CPS as a multidisciplinary view\nCommunication\
    \ between the system components \nis another important issue that needs to be\
    \ taken \ninto consideration. Cyber-Physical Systems need a \nreal-time communication\
    \ network that can provide \nguarantees on both the throughputs and delays of\
    \ \nthe system flow. \nThe communication network allows the formation \nof multiple\
    \ control loops within its structure/\ntopology, so that multiple control objectives\
    \ can \nbe achieved at the same time. The location of the \nsystems and the time\
    \ difference between entities \ninvolved in the control loop are two essential\
    \ \nissues caused by the distributed nature in CPS. \nIn this context, when modelling\
    \ a Cyber-Physical \nSystem, one must take into consideration all the \nmechanisms\
    \ that support semantic addressing \nfor portability and reusability of applications,\
    \ as \nwell as system management. Also, a middleware \nframework is required to\
    \ provide the right \nmechanisms which support the timelines \nbehaviour on the\
    \ control system and to tolerate \nfaults. The middleware framework is useful\
    \ \nto develop and control all the systems which \ninvolve the features of both\
    \ heterogeneity and  \ndistributed operation. \nFrom a networking viewpoint, some\
    \ widely-\nrecognized characteristics of CPS can be  \noutlined as: \n- \nNetwork\
    \ Complexity – the network of a \ntypical CPS is often large in scale due to the\
    \ \nnumber of existing distributed nodes;\n- \nResource Constraints – the embedded\
    \ devices \nare limited in energy efficiency, bandwidth, \nrate through, throughput,\
    \ etc.;\n- \nHybrid Traffic and Massive Data – due to the \nnumber of sensor and\
    \ nodes, a large volume \nof data is created;\n- \nUncertainty – In CPS there\
    \ are many \nfactors that can cause uncertainty – sensor \nmeasurements error,\
    \ computational model \nerror, software errors, and unreliability of \nwireless\
    \ communications or changes in \nnetwork topology;\n- \nStructural and behavioural\
    \ complexities \nare more challenging for modeling, analy-\nsis, design, verification\
    \ and implementation  \nof CPS.\nFuture systems must be based on composition \n\
    frameworks and more systematic or automated \nmethods for proving connectivity.\
    \ The complexity \nand heterogeneity of CPS impose special methods \nIoan Dumitrache,\

    \ and prove the correctness of the \noverall system design. An overview of all\
    \ aspects \nconnected with this new paradigm is presented in \nFigure 2.\nFigure\
    \ 2. Main components of a  \nCyber-Physical System\n2.2 Models and Architectures\
    \ in Cyber \nPhysical Systems\nA series of CPS models, frameworks and generic\
    \ \narchitectures have been identified in literature.\nThe CPS 5C level architecture\
    \ [16], proposes a 5 \nlayer approach consisting of: Connection; Data \nConversion;\
    \ Cyber; Cognition and Configuration. \nThe architecture allows for the development\
    \ \nof complex systems starting from Monitoring \nComponents towards Decision\
    \ Support Systems \nand Resilient Control Systems. The 5C approach \noffers guidelines\
    \ for the implementation of CPS \nin manufacturing industry.  \nThe NIST - CPS\
    \ Public Working Group proposes \na CPS Framework oriented towards unifying \n\
    the existing concepts as well as extending \nwith specific topics. The framework\
    \ addresses \ndomains, concerns, properties, facets and aspects. \nA conceptualization\
    \ facet, a realization facet and \nan assurance facet are proposed. The analysis\
    \ \nprocess proposed encompasses the following \nsteps: identify domains, identify\
    \ cross-cutting \nconcerns, analyse and address concerns [2].\nA related concept\
    \ refers to the liquid enterprise and \nthe osmose concept developed in the OSMOSE\
    \ \nproject [10] The osmose concept envisions a \nsemi-permeable membrane separating\
    \ the real, \ndigital and virtual environments. The OSMOSE \narchitecture proposes\
    \ a middleware system that \nenables intelligent communication supported by \n\
    osmosis and context management. To enable the \ncommunication an inter-world router\
    \ is proposed.\nReference Architectural Model Industrie 4.0 - \nRAMI 4.0 [11]\
    \ is an architectural model related \nto the Industrie 4.0 paradigm. In a structured\
    \ \nmanner RAMI 4.0 adopts a cube based layered \nrepresentation including 7 Hierarchy\
    \ Levels, a \nLife Cycle Value Stream addressed with the help \nof 6 Layers: Business,\
    \ Functional, Information, \nCommunication, Integration and Asset. The \narchitecture\
    \ aims at integrating Industrie 4.0 \nrelated concepts such as:  Flexible production\
    \ \nsystems, networked systems, hierarchy based \ninteraction, network integrated\
    \ product [11].\nThe Reference Architecture for CPS-Platforms - \nCYPROS - envisions\
    \ an increase in productivity \nalong with the implementation of intelligent \n\
    systems. The reference architecture is composed \nof an information model a methodology\
    \ for \nthe description of architectural elements and \na procedural model. The\
    \ information model \nprovides a framework for the developer to model \nCPS components.\n\
    3. Main Problems in Modelling \nCyber-Physical Systems\nThe main challenges in\
    \ order to develop the \nnext generation of intelligent Cyber-Physical  \nSystems\
    \ are:\n- \nHigh complexity of systems created by \ninteraction of different heterogeneous\
    \ objects \nwith discrete and continuous behaviors;\n- \nNeed to integrate computing\
    \ systems with \nphysical processes and networks into \ncomplex systems;\n- \n\
    The \ninteraction \nbetween \nphysical \nprocesses, \ncomputing, \nhardware \n\
    and \nsoftware and communication networks \nrequires the compositionality of the\
    \ \ncomponents and systems.\nHaving in mind the main characteristics and \ncomponents\
    \ of the CPSs, some technologies \nthat facilitate abstract specification, conceptual\
    \ \nmodelling \nand \nvirtual \ndevelopment, \nimplementation and simulation could\
    \ be \nconsidered: Abstractions and conceptual models; \nLogical frameworks and\
    \ architecture; Functional \nand control models; Protocols, languages  \nand standards.\n\
    A Conceptual Framework for Modeling and Design of Cyber-Physical Systems\nhttp://www.sic.ici.ro\n\
    328\nThe dynamics of CPSs is complex, involving the \nstochastic nature of communication\
    \ systems, the \ndiscrete event-driven dynamics of computing \nsystems and the\
    \ continuous one of control \nsystems. Formal mathematical and information \n\
    model of CPSs must be based on multi-level \nabstraction to consider overall structural\
    \ and \nbehavioural dynamics. The mathematical \nmodelling of complex and heterogeneous\
    \ \nsystems must solve the semantic dichotomy \nbetween the continuous and the\
    \ discrete event \ndriven operation.\nOne possibility to model complex dynamics\
    \ of \nCPSs is to use hybrid automata that can capture \nboth the transition between\
    \ discrete states and \nthe evolution of continuous states over time. \nBy using\
    \ the Model of Computation (MoC) to \ndefine the rules of interaction between\
    \ actors it \nis possible to create a simple hierarchical model. \nConsidering\
    \ different MoCs including Discrete \nEvents (DE), Continuous Time (CT), Finite\
    \ State \nMachine (FSM), Synchronous Reactive (SR), \nProcess Networks (PN) and\
    \ several varieties of \ndataflow could be developed the hierarchical \ncomposition\
    \ that combine CT models with \nDE and FSM to model hybrid systems. The \nfunctional\
    \ and structural models of different \ncomponents must be completed with the \n\
    implementation details such as the underlying \nplatform and the communication\
    \ networks [3].\nThe Model- Based Design (MBD) must take into \nconsideration\
    \ three main requirements:\n- \nCompositionality:  the property of a system \n\
    to compute from local properties; \n- \nComposability:  the component properties\
    \ \nare not changing as a result of interactions \nbetween components;\n- \nHeterogeneity,\
    \ in terms of the properties that are \ncomposed and their semantic domain represent\
    \ \nthe common future of all computational \ndesign frameworks. CPSs are inherently\
    \ \nheterogeneous \nin \nstructure, \ncomponent \nbehavior and types of interactions;\
    \ they have \nthree different design layers: physical, software \nand network/platform\
    \ respectively. \nThe controllers and the desired dynamics \nof the physical processes\
    \ are modelled first \nwith physical layer abstractions, but the \ncontroller\
    \ implemented is modelled using \nsoftware layer abstractions. The software \n\
    system is deployed on a computation \nplatform modelled with network/platform\
    \  \nlayer abstraction. \nThe different abstraction layers use fundamentally \n\
    different semantics and composition concepts into \nmulti resolution hierarchical\
    \ architectures. \nThe physical layer embodies physical objects \nand the interactions\
    \ of them. On this level the \nmathematics of composition is based on linear \n\
    algebra, topology and analysis and behaviour of \nphysical object is determined\
    \ by physical laws. \nThe software layer comprises the software \ncomponents with\
    \ behaviours expressed in logical \ntime and whose interactions are modelled by\
    \ \nvarious models of computations (MoCs). \nThe network/platform layer comprises\
    \ the \nhardware side of CPS architectures (network \narchitecture and computation\
    \ platform that \ninteract with the physical components by sensors \nand actuators).\n\
    Uncertainty in wireless communication must \nbe mitigated by using the complex\
    \ protocols to \nimprove fault tolerance but the time varying delays \nintroduced\
    \ in transmission could destabilize the \ncontrol loops [17, 21]. Trust, security\
    \ and privacy \n(TSP) of Wireless Sensor Networks needs sensor \nnode security,\
    \ cryptography algorithms, key \nmanagement approaches, secure routing strategies\
    \ \nand data aggregation [14].\nFigure 3. Main problems of CPS modelling\n4. A\
    \ Conceptual Framework for \nCyber-Physical Systems\nA starting point for the\
    \ design of the conceptual \nframework is represented by the adoption of \nprinciples\
    \ from proven enterprise architectures. \nIoan Dumitrache, Ioan Stefan Sacala,\
    \ Mihnea Alexandru Moisescu, Simona Iuliana Caramihai\n \n329\nICI Bucharest ©\

    \ generic smart \nintegrative platform, based on IoT concept and \nproviding the\
    \ user with a virtual, re-configurable \necosystem of services representing devices,\
    \ \nembedded systems, networked control systems \nand smart objects, thus overcoming\
    \ inherent \nfragmentation and heterogeneity, allowing an \ninnovative approach\
    \ in supporting multiple \napplications [25].\nIn order to fulfil its goals, the\
    \ platform should \nconsider the main aspects of heterogeneity, \ncomposability\
    \ and compositionality at different \nlevels of abstraction – systems, software\
    \ \narchitecture and controller level.\nTo allow modelling and analysing cross-domain\
    \ \ninteractions among physical and computational/ \nnetworking domains and to\
    \ ensure predictability \nof the system behaviour, the platform will \nbe designed\
    \ at two main levels: abstract  \nand functional.\nThe abstract level should integrate\
    \ multi-domain \nmodels analysed in multiple levels topology and \nabstractions,\
    \ multi-scale controls integrated in \nnetworked control systems [4].  \nAt the\
    \ functional level smart objects and \nplatforms will be integrated in order to\
    \ perform \nfunctionalities required by the business model \nconceived at the\
    \ abstract level (Figure 4).\nFigure 4. Integration of the main levels  \nof the\
    \ platform\nThe most difficult aspect will be the integration \nof these levels\
    \ by mechanisms, languages and \nmethodologies that will allow the platform to\
    \ support \ndeveloping applications, analysing and validating  \nthe performances.\
    \ \nAs it will have to consider heterogeneity-different \nmathematical models,\
    \ hardware and software, \nanalogue and digital, cyber and physical, integrating\
    \ \ndifferent smart objects, the platform will have \nan Architectural Space and\
    \ a Platform resources \nlibrary defining components, composition rules, \nabstraction\
    \ rules, refinement rules and interfaces that \nidentify legal connections. From\
    \ this point of view, \ninterconnections and communication protocols will \nprove\
    \ to be very important resources.\nThe complexity and diversity of heterogeneous\
    \ \ncomponents of the platform will be managed \nby generalized operators as Grouping,\
    \ Focusing \nAttention and Combinatorial Search into \nintelligent manner. They\
    \ will act especially at the \nabstract level and define a number of refinement\
    \ \nsteps that start from the initial description to the  \nfinal implementation.\n\
    In this way it will be allowed the modelling of \ninteractions, functionalities\
    \ and implementation \nrequirements, keeping model components consistent, \npreventing\
    \ misconnection of Model Components. \nThe platform will manage the system requirements\
    \ \nand have the capacity to improve scalability \nand accuracy of model analysis\
    \ including time  \nand concurrency.\nOther aspects that must be solved are related\
    \ to \nthe co-design of physical systems and controllers, \norchestrating networked\
    \ computational resources \nwith physical systems considering time, concurrency\
    \ \nin networked, distributed computational with physical \nsystems. For such\
    \ a goal, it will be necessary to \ndefine some general metrics to asses’ verification\
    \ and  \nvalidation solutions.\nThe main characteristic of the proposed CPS \n\
    architecture is represented by the need to define \nand model a CPS layer and\
    \ to define and model \nthe relation between the Business System and the \nEnterprise\
    \ Environment in the context of CPS.\nThe proposed CPS architecture is composed\
    \ based \non a generic representation that can be extended by \na set of associated\
    \ views.\nThe first layer addresses the enterprise  \nexisting infrastructure.\n\
    The second layer addresses the enterprise as a Cyber-\nPhysical System.\nThe third\
    \ layer addresses process management, \nDecision Support Systems and Data Analytics\
    \ related \nto information associated to processes, products  \nand by-products.\n\
    A Conceptual Framework for Modeling and Design of Cyber-Physical Systems\nhttp://www.sic.ici.ro\n\
    330\nThe forth layer is addresses the business system, \nincluding: business intelligence\
    \ and supply  \nchain management.\nFigure 5.  Generic Architecture\nThe infrastructure\
    \ layer includes components such \nas equipment, machines, and resources.\nThe\
    \ infrastructure system organized using \ninfrastructure as a service principle\
    \ facilitates the \ndescription and access to equipment, machines as \nwell as\
    \ sensing and actuating devices [20]. \nThe Cyber-Physical System layer includes\
    \ \nthe following components: modeling, data \nacquisition, control, actuation,\
    \ management and \ncommunication. This representation allows for \nthe development\
    \ of specific system architectures, \ndata architectures as well as the connection\
    \ with \ninfrastructure architecture.\nThe main considerations related to the\
    \ modelling \ncomponent include:\n- \nModels with solve - dependent, non-\ndeterminate,\
    \ or Zeno-behaviour (CPS can be \nseen as a hybrid systems using continuous-\n\
    time models for physical processes and state \nmachines, dataflow models, synchronous/\
    \ \nreactive models and/or discrete event models \nfor computation);\n- \nKeeping\
    \ \nmodel \ncomponents \nconsistent \n(Multiple models with multiple variants\
    \ of \ncomponents must be integrated into complex \nsystems) [18];\n- \nPreventing\
    \ \nmisconnection \nof \nmodel \ncomponents \n(Errors \nthat \nappear \nwithin\
    \ \ninterconnected components must be taken into \nconsideration, as well as unit\
    \ errors, semantic \nerrors, transposition errors) [11];\n- \nModelling of interactions\
    \ of functionality and \nimplementation (The dynamics of software and \nnetworks\
    \ should be modelled accordingly);\n- \nModelling \nof \ndistributed \nand  \n\
    emergent behaviors.\nThe main considerations related to the data \ncomponent include:\
    \ data modelling, data \ninteroperability, data storage [13].\nThe data architecture\
    \ allows for the acquisition \nof sensor data, the integration of business related\
    \ \ndata and the semantic enhancement of data with \nthe aid of metadata.\nThe\
    \ main considerations related to the control \ncomponent include:\n- \nNetworked\
    \ Control Systems encompassing \ncommunication \nbetween \ncontroller \nand \n\
    physical \nsystems \nas \nwell \nas  \nbetween controllers;\n- \nThe integration\
    \ of Hybrid Systems;\n- \nReal Time Computing.\nThe main considerations related\
    \ to the \nmanagement component include: Management \nof distributed systems;\
    \ Management of Hybrid \nSystems; Real Time Scheduling; Cyber Physical \nSystems\
    \ Security.\nThe management component extends:\n- \nSensing capability: data related\
    \ to the physical \nor virtual environment [24];\n- \nIdentity: \nability \nto\
    \ \ndifferentiate \nfrom  \nother entities;\n- \nNetwork: \nability \ncommunicate\
    \ \nthe  \nacquired data;\n- \nAction capability: shaping the environment.\nThe\
    \ CPS layer is directly connected to the \nInfrastructure layer and describes\
    \ and manages \nall the entities that collect data from the physical \nenvironment\
    \ (sensors), interact with the \nenvironment (actuators) and relay the data and\
    \ \ncommands to the upper level.\nThe following requirements need to be addressed\
    \ \nin order to design the CPS layer: Agility, \nadaptability in production systems;\
    \ autonomy \nand flexibility in production systems; Self-\nconfiguring capabilities\
    \ adding or removing new \nresources or creating new task; Self-optimizing \n\
    capabilities to improve its performances, by  \ngoal-directed control.\nAn open\

    \ as a Complex Cyber – \nPhysical System\nCurrent Industrial Revolution driven\
    \ by CPS and \nIoT is expected to have a major impact on the \nfuture of agriculture\
    \ as well, as there is a natural \nrelation between industry and agriculture [1].\
    \ As \na extension of Industry 4.0 a new concept can \nbe introduced: Agriculture\
    \ 4.0.  Integration of \nmachines and equipment, increased automation, \nefficient\
    \ decisional process represents objectives \nof an agricultural enterprise facilitating\
    \ the \nadaptability to climate and market dynamics \nand perturbations and allowing\
    \ for sustainable, \necological and socially beneficial development.\nWhen addressing\
    \ the agricultural enterprise \nconcept (which will be referred subsequently,\
    \ \nin short, as “farm”) organization we must take \nA Conceptual Framework for\
    \ Modeling and Design of Cyber-Physical Systems\nhttp://www.sic.ici.ro\n332\n\
    into consideration the following agriculture \nrelated concepts [7]: Sustainable\
    \ and \nconservable Agriculture, Organic Agriculture, \nIndustrial Agriculture,\
    \ as well as Community  \nSupported Agriculture.\nAlso, in accordance with an\
    \ EU Agricultural and \nRural Development Study “Precision Agriculture \n(PA)\
    \ is a whole-farm management approach using \ninformation technology, satellite\
    \ positioning \n(GNSS) data, remote sensing and proximal data \ngathering. These\
    \ technologies have the goal of \noptimizing returns on inputs whilst potentially\
    \ \nreducing environmental impacts.” [4].\nIn Figure 7, a vision of farm components\
    \ is \npresented, focusing on resources, processes \nand products. The general\
    \ farm representation \nis assumed considering both animal and \nvegetal products\
    \ and, consequently, the three \nmajor components that need to be need to be \n\
    addressed when considering a paradigm shift in  \nfarm organization:\nFigure 7.\
    \ Main components and activities of a \ngeneric farm\nIntegrating and processing\
    \ the data regarding the \ncrops, the soil and the agricultural production \n\
    can and should assure the efficient exploitation \nof the agricultural fields,\
    \ the soil and an optimal \nhydration through a real-time intelligent  \ncontrol\
    \ system. \nAgriculture organizations need to address \nthe problem of complex\
    \ systems in relation \nto emerging paradigms such as Internet of \nThings and\
    \ Cyber Physical Systems. CPS are \nvery important in assuring optimal control,\
    \ by \nconnecting intelligent sensor networks.\nAlso, in the logistics field,\
    \ new opportunities \narise in the area of intelligent objects, ensuring \nthe\
    \ optimal level of real-time monitoring of the \nobjects’ state and place.\nIntegration\
    \ CPS in Agriculture Organizations must \ntake into consideration: \n- \nComponents\
    \ heterogeneity and complexity \nthat require new models and representation \n\
    languages in order to allow interoperability \nand composition;\n- \nNatural agents\
    \ interaction (human operators) \nwith hardware and software agents;\n- \nUncertainties\
    \ existing in complex systems, \ngenerated by the physical processes and \ncommunication\
    \ networks;\n- \nPerformance \nmeasuring \nand \nvalidation \nsystems, \ntaking\
    \ \ninto \nconsideration  \nnew metrics.\nWe can identify three major farm subsystems\
    \ in \naccordance with the product type: \n- \nThe soil management subsystem,\
    \ which \nincludes all the general aspects related to \nculture and pasture planning,\
    \ fertilization \nand soil humidity monitoring and control, \nwith respect to\
    \ actual conditions, weather \nforecasts, market predictions, enterprise goals\
    \ \nand production techniques and technologies;\n- \nThe plant management sub-system,\
    \ which \ndeals with the implementation of goals settled \nby the soil management\
    \ sub-system for crops; \nit takes into account aspects related to plant \nselection,\
    \ work planning in accordance with \nthe crop specificities and soil quality and\
    \ \nupdated according with weather conditions, \nplant health and so on;\n- \n\
    The livestock management sub-system, with \nsimilar goals, but related to animals.\n\
    Smart Farming includes the following areas of \ninterest: Sensor system, Traceability,\
    \ Smart agri-\nlogistics, Smart food awareness.\nBy using a suitable selection\
    \ of machines, an \nincreased automation degree, efficient exploitation \nof multi-annual\
    \ databases in the decisional \nprocess, the objective of an agricultural enterprise,\
    \ \nwith real capabilities of self-reconfiguration and \nadaptation at environmental,\
    \ weather and market \ndynamics and perturbations, can be achieved.\nThe architecture\
    \ of the agricultural enterprise is \ncomposed of a generic representation and\
    \ a set of \nviews associated to the representation.\nIoan Dumitrache, Ioan Stefan\

    \ \nand monitoring, weather monitoring, biomass \nmonitoring, farm parameters\
    \ sensor monitoring, \nmachine vision systems, remote sensing (drones \nand robots).\n\
    The Farm Automation System include: irrigation \nsystems, feeding systems, other\

    \ Physical \nSub-layer in order to collect data from sensors, \ninteracting with\

    \ \nActuators, Wireless sensors networks (Figure 8).\n6. Conclusions\nA generic\
    \ architecture based on Cyber-Physical \nSystems concept has been proposed using\
    \ a \npredefined scenario.\nA smart farm can be implemented by integrating \n\
    the most important results of the research in \nadvanced technological fields.\

    rights and content Abstract Our planet is facing a serious fresh water crisis
    and improved management of water resources presents significant research challenges.
    About 70% of the world''s fresh water is consumed by agriculture and water application
    efficiencies are typically low. Improving the efficiency of water use in agriculture
    would deliver substantial economic and environmental benefits. To help address
    the issue of low water application efficiency, wireless sensor network technologies
    can be combined with automation to support the efficient production of food in
    a increasingly water limited future. This paper reports on results of combining
    these approaches to irrigate an apple orchard, where existing irrigation scheduling
    was predominately based on time consuming manual acquisition of soil moisture
    data. The system developed allowed fully automated on-farm irrigation based on
    real-time feedback control which increased economic water use efficiency by 73%
    compared with manual irrigation. It is suggested that the application of real-time
    feedback automation would dramatically improve economic efficiency for irrigators
    with low water efficiency. Whereas, for those irrigators already achieving high
    water efficiency, adoption of the technology provides substantial labour and time
    savings. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords AgricultureEnvironmentsFeedback

    Location: Coimbatore, India SECTION I. Introduction There are many techniques
    available for the precision agriculture to monitor and control, environment for
    the growth of many crops. Due to unequal distribution of rain water, it is very
    difficult to requirement needed farmer to manage the water equally to all the
    crops in whole farm it requires some irrigation method that suitable for any weather
    condition, soil types and variety of crops. Irrigation management is a important
    factor in agriculture allows the farmer to improve the cultivation in a way the
    plants need. According to the requirement of the crops the threshold will be set,
    if the any environmental condition like temperature, soil conditions and humidity
    goes below or above the threshold value, then IOT sense the changing in parameters
    are monitored simultaneously and all the data will be transmitted to farmers,
    according to that farmer will take the controlling decision and send to the system.
    The system will run the actuator and control the parameter. Types of sensor used
    and controlling action that are taken according to them Temperature control -
    Growth of plantation depends on photosynthesis methods that is depends upon the
    radiation from the sun. Humidity control -Water vapour is main problem that''s
    affecting the growth of crops. Because of high humidity, chances of disease are
    increasing. Soil control- Soil water also affects the crop growth. Therefore,
    the monitor & control of soil condition have a specific interest, because the
    good condition of a soil provides the proper yield. The Proposal of the project
    is to develop a smart irrigation monitoring system using Arduino. Focus area will
    be parameters such as temperature and soil moisture. SECTION II. Objective The
    main objective of our project is to work for Farming where various new technologies
    to yield higher growth of the crops and their water supply. We are going to check
    the temperature, humidity, and soil moisture. The paper is all about automated
    control features with latest electronic technology using microcontroller which
    turns the pumping motor ON and OFF on detecting the dampness content of the earth
    and GSM phone line. It works automatically and hence reduces the man power. Irrigation
    is the artificial application of water to the land or soil. It is used to assist
    in growing of agricultural crops, maintenance of landscapes, and revegetation
    of disturbed soils in dry areas and during periods of inadequate rainfall. Watering
    systems will reduce the burden of getting water to plants when they need it. Knowing
    when and how much to water is two important aspects of watering process. To make
    the gardener works easily, the automatic plant watering system is created. SECTION
    III. Existing System Now days, water shortage is one of the biggest problem in
    the world. Many different methods are developed for conservation of water. We
    need water in each and every field. Water is considered to be basic need of all
    living creatures. Agriculture is one of the fields where water is required in
    massive quantity. Major problem in agriculture is every time excess of water is
    given to the fields. Many techniques are used to save or to control wastage of
    water from agriculture like Ditch Irrigation, Terraced Irrigation, Sprinkler System
    Rotary Systems. An automatic Smart Irrigation Decision Support System, SIDSS,
    is determined to manage irrigation in agriculture. System estimates the weekly
    irrigations needs of a plantation, on the basis of both soil evaluation and climatic
    variables convoked by several autonomous nodes deployed infield. This enables
    a closed loop control scheme to adapt the decision support system to local perturbations
    and evaluation errors. Two machine learning approach, PLSR and ANFIS, are proposed
    as reasoning engine of our SIDSS. This approach is validated on three commercial
    plantations of citrus trees located in Spain. Performance is evaluated against
    decisions taken by a human expert. The main characteristic of system is the use
    of continuous soil measurements to complement climatic parameters to precisely
    predict the irrigation needs the crops, in contrast with previous works that are
    based only on weather variables or doesn''t indicate the amount of water required
    by the crops. The use of real-time information from the soil specification in
    a closed loop control scheme allows to get used to the decision support system
    to local perturbations, avoiding the accumulative effect due to errors in consecutive
    weekly estimation, and/or detecting if the irrigation calculated for the SIDSS
    has been performed by the farmer. The analysis of the performance of the system
    is accomplished comparing the decisions taken by a human expert and the decision
    support component. Two machine learning techniques, PLSR and ANFIS, have been
    proposed as the basis of our reasoning engine and analysed in order to obtain
    the best performance. Limitations in the Existing System The Existing irrigation
    system does not make the efficient use of water. Water is not fed to the plant
    whenever there is need it leads to water scarcity. Quantity of water is not defined
    for each water supply in irrigation system. SECTION IV. Proposed System The Proposal
    of the project is to develop a smart irrigation monitoring system using Arduino.
    Focus area will be parameters such as temperature and soil moisture. This system
    will be a substitute to classical farming method. We will develop such a system
    that will help a farmer to know his field status in his home or he may be residing
    in any part of the world. It proposes an automatic irrigation system for the agricultural
    lands. Currently the automation is one of the important role in the human life.
    It not only provides comfort but also reduce energy, efficiency and time saving.
    Now the industries are using automation and control machine which is high in cost
    and not suitable for using in a farm field. So here it also designs a smart irrigation
    technology in low cost which is usable by Indian farmers. Arduino is the main
    heart of the whole system. An automated irrigation system was developed to optimize
    water use for agricultural crops. Automation allows us to control appliances automatically.
    The objectives of this paper were to control the water motor automatically and
    we can also watch live streaming of farm on android mobiles by using wi-fi. Advantages
    of the Proposed System The proposed system provides real time information on the
    field irrigation. Here the water is supplied based on the actual needs for the
    crops. This automated irrigation system is cost reduction and resource optimization.
    It improves the environment quality and increases the irrigation. It also reduces
    water logging and water shortages. SECTION V. System Architecture This archetype
    monitors the amount of soil humidity and temperature. A predetermine range of
    soil moisture and temperature is set, and can be varied with soil type or crop
    type. In case the moisture or temperature of the soil diverges from the specified
    range, the watering system is turned on/off. In case of dry soil and high soil
    temperature, it will activate the irrigation system, pumping water for watering
    the plants. Figure 1. System architecture Show All The block diagram of smart
    irrigation system is characterized in Fig1. It consists of a microcontroller (ATmega328)
    which is the brain of the system. Both the moisture and temperature sensors are
    combined to the input pins of the controller. The water pump and the servo motor
    are coupled with the output pins. If the sensors depart from the per-ordinated
    range, the controller turns on pump. The servo motor is used to control the angular
    point of the pipe, which ensures equal diffusion of water to the soil. To reduce
    the amount of field work for the farmer this operation also offers wireless switching
    on-off of pumps for watering, irrigating. Wireless sensor network of soil moisture
    sensor, soil pH sensor and soil temperature sensor is connected to an Arduino
    Mega 2560 micro controller board. The android application controls the pumps over
    GSM network via SMS (which enables pump control over long distances) and Blue-tooth
    (when in close proximity for real time diagnosis of the sensor readings). This
    system can be implemented on a large scale for farming purposes, which can further
    prove to be more beneficial. Owing to prevailing conditions and water shortages,
    the optimum irrigation schedules should be determined especially in farms to conserve

    Conclusion In the present the farmers use irrigation approach through the manual
    control, in which the farmers irrigate the land at regular intervals. This process
    seems to consume more water and results in water wastage. Moreover, in dry areas
    where there is inadequate rainfall, irrigation becomes difficult. Hence, we require
    an automatic system that will precisely monitor and control the water essential
    in the field. Installing Smart irrigation system saves time and ensures judicious
    usage of water. Moreover, this architecture uses micro-controller which promises
    an increase in system life by reducing power consumption. The entire system is
    monitored and controlled by the power full credit card sized micro-controller
    Arduino. It provides with several benefits and can achieve with less manpower.
    The system provides water only when the humidity in the soil goes below the reference.
    Due to the direct transfer of water to the roots water management takes place
    and also helps to maintain the moisture to soil ratio at the root zone consistent
    to some extent. Thus, the system is efficient and compatible to changing environment.
    Our Future work involves, a water meter installed to estimate the amount of water
    used for irrigation and thus giving a cost estimation. A valve can be used for
    varying the volume of water flow. Furthermore, Wireless sensors can also be used.

    Get rights and content Highlights • Development of a Smart Irrigation Decision
    Support System, for precision agriculture. • The developed system estimates the
    weekly irrigations needs of a plantation, based on soil and climatic variables.
    • Performance is tested against decisions taken by a human expert on three commercial
    plantations. Abstract In this paper, an automatic Smart Irrigation Decision Support
    System, SIDSS, is proposed to manage irrigation in agriculture. Our system estimates
    the weekly irrigations needs of a plantation, on the basis of both soil measurements
    and climatic variables gathered by several autonomous nodes deployed in field.
    This enables a closed loop control scheme to adapt the decision support system
    to local perturbations and estimation errors. Two machine learning techniques,
    PLSR and ANFIS, are proposed as reasoning engine of our SIDSS. Our approach is
    validated on three commercial plantations of citrus trees located in the South-East
    of Spain. Performance is tested against decisions taken by a human expert. Previous

    optimisationMachine learning 1. Introduction The efficient use of water in agriculture
    is one of the most important agricultural challenges that modern technologies
    are helping to achieve. In arid and semiarid regions, the differences between
    precipitation and irrigation water requirements are so big that irrigation management
    is a priority for sustainable and economically profitable crops (IDAE, 2005).
    To accomplish this efficient use, expert agronomists rely on information from
    several sources (soil, plant and atmosphere) to properly manage the irrigation
    requirements of the crops (Puerto et al., 2013). This information is defined by
    a set of variables, which can be measured using sensors, that are able to characterise
    the water status of the plants and the soil in order to obtain their water requirements.
    While meteorological variables are representative of a large area and can be easily
    measured by a single sensor for a vast land extension, soil and plant variables
    have a large spatial variability. Therefore, in order to use these parameters
    to effectively schedule the irrigation of the plants, multiple sensors are needed
    (Naor et al., 2001). Weather is one of the key factors being used to estimate
    the water requirements of the crops (Allen et al., 1998). Moreover, it is very
    frequent that public agronomic management organisms have weather stations spread
    around the different regions. These weather stations usually provide information
    of key variables for the agriculture like reference evapotranspiration (ET0) or
    the Vapour Pressure Deficit (VPD) that are of great importance to calculate the
    water requirements of the crops. Using variables related to the climate is the
    most common approach to create crop water requirement models (Jensen et al., 1970,
    Smith, 2000, Zwart and Bastiaanssen, 2004). Using these models, based on solely
    meteorological variables, a decision-making system can determine how a given crop
    will behave (Guariso et al., 1985). However, not all the regions have access to
    an extensive network of weather stations or they may not be nearby a given crop,
    thus the local micro-climates are not taken into account if only these parameters
    are used. Besides, irrigation models based only on climate parameters rely on
    an open loop structure. This means that the model is subject to stochastic events
    and it may not be able to correct the local perturbations that can occur when
    a unexpected weather phenomenon occurs (for instance irrigate the crop when it’s
    already raining) (Dutta et al., 2014, Giusti and Marsili-Libelli, 2015). Finally,
    monitoring other variables, such as hydrodynamic soil factors or water drainage,
    might increase the chances that the irrigation predicted by the models is properly
    used by the plants (Kramer and Boyer, 1995). Therefore, the usage of sensors that
    measures the soil water status is a key complement to modulate the water requirements
    of the crops. Soil variables, such as soil moisture content or soil matric potential,
    are considered by many authors as crucial part of scheduling tools for managing
    irrigation (Cardenas-Lailhacar and Dukes, 2010, Soulis et al., 2015). The information
    from soil sensors can be used to create better decision models with closed loop
    structures that adapt to weather and soil perturbations (Cardenas-Lailhacar and
    Dukes, 2010, Soulis et al., 2015). This practice, however, has not been widely
    adopted due to the technological limitations of available soil sensors, which
    required measured information to be registered and stored, traditionally using
    wired dataloggers, and limiting the installation flexibility and the real time
    interaction. This has changed recently with new generation sensors and sensor
    networks that are more versatile and suited to the agricultural environment (Navarro-Hellín
    et al., 2015). Combining climate and soil variables has therefore potential to
    properly manage irrigation in a more efficient way than other traditional approaches.
    However, it also entails a series of challenges related with the increased amount
    of data flow, its analysis and its use to create effective models, in particular
    when data provided by different sources may seem contradictory and/or redundant.
    Traditionally, this analysis and modelling is performed by a human expert who
    interprets the different variables. The need of a human agronomist expert is required
    due to the complexity introduced by the soil spatial variability, crop species
    variability and their irrigation requirements over the growth cycle (Maton et
    al., 2005), which require comparing crops models and local context variables to
    determine the specific water requirements to achieve a certain goal at a particular
    location. The complexity of this problem and the different sources of variability
    makes than even the best model may deviate from the prediction, which favours
    the use of close loop control systems combining soil and climate sensors over
    open loop systems as a way to compensate possible deviations in future predictions.
    Human expertise has been proved effective to assist irrigation management but
    it is not scalable and available to every field, farm and crop and it is slow
    in the analysis of the data and real time processing. Instead, applying machine
    learning techniques to replace the manual models and to assist expert agronomists
    allows the viability of creating automatic Irrigation Decision Support System.
    Machine learning techniques have been used previously to estimate relevant parameters
    of the crop (Sreekanth et al., 2015). Giusti and Marsili-Libelli(2015) present
    a fuzzy decision systems to predict the volumetric water content of the soil based
    on local climate data. Adeloye et al. (2012), proposed the use of unsupervised
    artificial neural networks (ANN) to estimate the evapotranspiration also based
    on weather information solely. King and Shellie (2016) used NN modelling to estimate
    the lower threshold temperature (Tnws) needed to calculate the crop water stress
    index for wine grapes. In Campos et al. (2016) the authors presented a new algorithm
    designed to estimate the total available water in the soil root zone of a vineyard
    crop, using only SWC sensors, which are very dependent of the location. Taking
    advantage of the soil information, Valdés-Vela et al., 2015, Abrisqueta et al.,
    2015 incorporates the volumetric soil water content, manually collected with a
    neutron probe, to agro-meteorological data. This information is then fed into
    a fuzzy logic system to estimate the stem water potential. Other approaches in
    the literature also make use of machine learning techniques – such as principal
    component analysis, unsupervised clustering, and ANN – to estimate the irrigation
    requirements in crops. However they do not specify the quantity of water needed
    (Dutta et al., 2014), they reduce the prediction to true or false, and/or they
    are based on open loop structures (Giusti and Marsili-Libelli, 2015, Jensen et
    al., 1970, Smith, 2000, Zwart and Bastiaanssen, 2004), only considering the weather
    information and, therefore, unable to correct deviations from their predictions.
    This paper proposes an automated decision support system to manage the irrigation
    on a certain crop field, based on both climatic and soil variables provided by
    weather stations and soil sensors. As discussed, we postulate that the usage of
    machine learning techniques with the weather and soil variables is of great importance
    and can help to achieve a fully automated close loop system able to precisely
    predict the irrigation needs of a crop. Our presented system is evaluated by comparing
    it against the irrigations reports provided by an agronomist specialist during
    a complete season in different fields. 2. System structure An irrigation advice
    system is based on the concept of predicting the waters needs of the crops in
    order to irrigate them properly. Traditionally this decision has been taken by
    an experienced farmer or an expert agricultural technician. Fig. 1 shows the flow
    diagram of which the proposed system is based. Download : Download high-res image
    (82KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Flow diagram of the proposed
    system. In this schema, an expert agronomist is in charge of analysing the information
    from different sources: Weather stations located near the crops that collect meteorological
    data, Crop and Soil characteristics (type, age, size, cycle, etc.) and Soil sensors
    installed in the crop fields. The expert analyses the information to provide an
    irrigation report, which indicates the amount of water needed to irrigate properly
    the crops in the upcoming week. To make this decision making process manageable,
    the information needed to create the irrigation report on the next week is only
    the information of the current week. Based on this concept, our Smart Irrigation
    Decision Support System (SIDSS) is proposed. In order to evaluate the performance
    and validity of our approach, the decision system will use the same information
    used by the expert agronomist and will output the water requirements for the upcoming
    week. This will ensure a fair comparison between the decisions taken by a human
    expert and the SIDSS. To accomplish this, the machine learning system must be
    trained with historical data and irrigations reports of the agronomist, using
    the irrigation decisions taken in these reports as the groundtruth of the system.
    The aim of the system is to be as accurate as possible to this groundtruth. Several
    machine learning techniques were applied and evaluated to achieve the best performance.

    The Irrigation Decision System is composed of three main components: a collection
    device that gathers information from the soil sensors, weather stations that provide
    agrometeorological information and the SIDSS that, when trained correctly, is
    able to predict the irrigation requirements of the crops for the incoming week.

    2.1. Collection device and soil sensors The information from the soil sensors
    is gathered using our own developed device that has been proved to be completely
    functional for irrigation management in different crops and conditions (Navarro-Hellín
    et al., 2015). This device is wireless, equipped with a GSM/GPRS modem, and is
    completely autonomous, so that the installation procedures are accessible to any
    farmer. Fig. 3 shows the collection device installed in a lemon crop field located
    in the South-East of Spain. Download : Download high-res image (302KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Device installed in a lemon crop field. The
    device allows to fully configure the recording rates of all the embedded sensors.
    In our experiments, a sampling rate of 15 min was set, since this gives a good
    balance between providing enough information to support a correct agronomic decision
    and maintaining the autonomy of the device with the equipped solar panel and battery
    (López Riquelme et al., 2009, Navarro-Hellín et al., 2015. The information is
    received, processed and stored in a relational database. 2.1.1. Soil sensors The
    soil control variables used to provide SIDSS with relevant information are matric
    potential (Ψm) and volumetric soil water content (θv), which are common in irrigation
    management (Jones, 2004). By using these variables, the irrigation can be scheduled
    for maintaining soil moisture conditions equivalent or close to field capacity
    in order to satisfy the required crop water requirements. Likewise, they can be
    used to maintain soil water content or soil matric potential under certain reference
    values proper of regulated deficit irrigation strategies. Both Ψm and θv are used
    to decide the irrigation frequency and to adjust the gross irrigation doses. Soil
    matric potential was measured with MPS-2 sensors (Decagon devices, Inc., Pullman,
    WA 99163 – USA), while volumetric soil water content was measured with both 10-HS
    (Decagon devices, Inc., Pullman, WA 99163 – USA) and Enviroscan (Sentek Pty. Ltd.,
    Adelaide, Australia) sensors. Besides both previous soil sensors, another sensor
    is used. A pluviometer (Rain-o173-matic small, Pronamic Ltd., Ringkøbing, Denmark)
    was used under the dripper to provide accurate estimation of the amount of water
    applied and the irrigation run time. The information provided by this sensor was
    used to ensure that the farmer is following the instruction of the agronomic reports
    provided by the expert. Table 2 summarises the variables measured by the soils
    sensors. Table 2. Soil sensors technical information. Sensor Measured data Variable

    Weather stations Experiments took place in the Region of Murcia, Spain. In this
    region, there is a network of 45 agro-meteorological stations located in irrigated
    areas, the Agricultural Information Network System of Murcia (SIAM), funded by
    the EU and installed to help estimate the reference evapotranspiration (ET0) and
    the irrigation needs of crops after a severe drought between 1979 and 1985. The
    variables measured by the stations are the following: Temperature (T), Relative
    humidity (RH), Global radiation (GR), Wind speed (WS), Rainfall (RF), Dew point
    (DP), Vapour Pressure Deficit (VPD). These variables, measured by the different
    stations, are publicly available and can be downloaded from the SIAM website (SIAM,
    2015). The weather stations are tested and calibrated periodically according to
    the manufacturer’s specifications. The amount of water required to compensate
    the evapotranspiration loss from the cropped field is defined as crop water requirement.
    Therefore, knowing the reference crop evapotranspiration is of key importance
    to estimate the crop’s water requirements. Using the FAO Penman–Monteith formulation
    (Allen et al., 1998), the daily reference crop evapotranspiration (ET0) can be
    calculated by means of the weather information. The crop evapotranspiration under
    standard condition (ETc) can be calculated using the single crop coefficient approach
    shown below: (1) where Kc is the crop coefficient and depends on multiple factors,
    namely, the crop type, climate, crop evaporation and soil growth stages. 2.3.
    Smart Irrigation Decision Support System The decision support system is the component
    in charge of taking the final decision on the amount of water to be irrigated,
    or equivalently, the number of minutes to irrigate considering constant water
    flow. This decision is taken automatically on the basis of the information provided
    by the sensors and the usage of machine learning and pattern recognition techniques.
    The aim of this component, therefore, is to mimic a human expert in the decision
    making process of weekly optimising the irrigation, which could assist the farmer.
    Applying machine learning techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
    or Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) allow us to visualise the information to
    perform an initial exploratory analysis. Fig. 4 shows the LDA of the input, array
    containing the sensorial variables, and output, the estimated irrigation time
    need, used in the system. The output was divided in classes (18), each one representing
    the weekly irrigation time by increments of 150 min, from 0 to 2700 min. From
    this figure, it can be noticed that discrete classification in classes will be
    hard to accomplish due to the high number of classes necessary to precisely quantise
    the irrigation estimation. This is due to the fact that the variable to estimate
    – either the amount of water or the watering time-has an intrinsic continuous
    nature, since the expected output can take any real value between 0 and infinity.
    Therefore, conventional classifiers aiming categorical outputs – such as LDA (Fisher,
    1938), SVM (Belousov et al., 2002), and ANN are not optimal for this application.
    Instead, methodologies based on regression (Wold et al., 1984), and/or fuzzy logic
    (Zadeh et al., 1996) allow us to estimate a more suited continuous variable. Download

    Linear discriminant analysis for 18 irrigation time intervals. In this section,
    we propose two different techniques, each belonging to one of the previous families,
    to estimate the weekly required amount of water. As described in the introduction
    and experimental sections, both modelling techniques require a supervised training
    set in order to learn the irrigation model. 2.3.1. Partial least square regression
    Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR) (Wold et al., 2001) is a statistical method
    that seeks the fundamental relations between predictor and response variables.
    Predictor variables, X, are defined as the observable variables that can be measured
    and input into the decision system. Response variable Y are the outputs or estimates
    that must be deducted from the input. The relationship between both variable sets,
    and linear multivariate regression model, is found by projecting both predicted
    and observable variables into a new space, where latent variables are estimated
    to model the covariance structure between the predictor space and the observation
    space. This PLSR model is developed from a training set D = {X, Y} of S samples,
    which is composed of the predictor matrix X = [x1, … , xi, … , xS]T and the response
    matrix Y = [y1, … , yi, … , yS]T. xi is a column vector of K elements, that can
    contain all the sensor and weather variables measured at a given week i: (2) and
    yi is another column vector of M elements, containing the corresponding variables
    to be estimated at that week i. Since in our application this is only the irrigation
    time recommended at that week, yi is reduced to a scalar and M = 1: PLSR constructs
    new predictor latent variables, known as components, which are linear combinations
    of the original predictor observable variables. These components are created to
    explain the observed variability in the original predictor variables, while simultaneously
    considering the response variable. That is, the estimated latent variables are
    linear combinations of predictor variables that have higher covariance with Y.
    Using the latent variables leads to a regression models able to fit the response
    variable with fewer components. The PLSR learning model can be expressed as: (3)
    (4) where T and U are the projections – aka scores – of X and Y into a smaller
    L-dimensional latent space respectively, P and Q are the orthogonal projection
    matrices – aka loading matrices – and E and G the error residuals. P and Q can
    be obtained by eigendecomposition of the original matrices. Since the X-scores
    T are meant to be good predictors of Y, it can be approximated that: (5) Being
    F a new residual. This reduces the problem to find a set of weights W such that
    T = X ∗ W predicts X and Y reasonably well. As mentioned, these orthogonal coefficients
    should maximise the correlation between X and Y while explaining the variance
    of X: (6) P and Q can be solved by applying a Least Square Estimator (LSE) so:
    (7) (8) Finally, by rewriting the previous equation, it can be derived that: (9)
    Being B the PLSR regression coefficients. Once these coefficients have been learned,
    responses y∗ for new observation x∗ can be estimated by applying the learning
    model: (10) assuming an estimation error f. We favour the use of PLSR among other
    regression techniques due to its suitability when the number of predictors is
    bigger than the number of response variables, the responses are noisy and there
    is a high probability of having multicollinearity among the predictor variables.
    The multicollinear phenomenon happens when those variable are highly correlated,
    due to redundancy between sensors and or between meteorological factors. As it
    can be noticed, all these factors appear in our irrigation problem. 2.3.2. Adaptive
    neuro fuzzy inference systems Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference Systems (ANFIS) (Jang,
    1993) is a fuzzy inference system for systematically generating fuzzy rules from
    a given input/output D dataset. This machine learning technique combines advantages
    from fuzzy logic and artificial neural networks. On the one hand, it allows us
    to represent an element not only into categories but also into a certain degree
    of membership functions, which allows mimicking the characteristics of human reasoning
    and decision making. On the one hand, it can be trained and so can self-improve
    in order to adjust the membership functions parameters directly from data (Wang
    et al., 2006). The ANFIS architecture consists in a five-layer feedforward neural
    network (Fig. 5) whose parameters are updated using a combination of gradient
    descent and LSE in a two-pass learning algorithm. Download : Download high-res
    image (95KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Example of ANFIS architecture
    for a input x with K variables and a 1-variable output y. In a first forward pass
    step, neuron outputs are calculated layer by layer and some internal consequent
    parameters are identified by the least squares estimator (LSE) to obtain the final
    single output. The forward pass operation at layer 1 defines the fuzzy membership
    for each input variable X. Assuming a Gaussian distribution function , the output
    of this layer is given by: (11) Layer 2 is a multiplicative layer, which calculates
    the firing strength of the rules as a product of the previous membership grades.
    (12) Layer 3 is a normalising layer, where: (13) Layer 4 applies a node function:
    (14) where and are consequent parameters estimated using LSE. Finally, layer 5
    is the output layer that provides the overall estimation y as a summation of all
    incoming signals. For the case M = 1, where only one output variable is estimated:
    (15) After the forward pass has been completed, an initial estimation is provided
    by the ANFIS network. Since initial premise parameters are initialised randomly,
    the initial estimation will differ greatly from the desired values Y. This error
    or difference between the desired output y and the estimated output for a given
    training sample {xi, yi} can be expressed as: (16) To correct this deviation,
    a second learning step, or backward pass, attempts to minimise the estimated error
    by modifying the value of the premise parameters until the desired and estimated
    outputs are similar. This process is performed using backpropagation, where the
    error is propagated back over the layers and decomposed into the different nodes
    using the chain rule. Gradient descend is used as optimisation technique to update
    the premise parameters while the consequent parameters are kept fixed until the
    next iteration. This double step learning process is repeated iteratively for
    every single sample in the training set until the estimated error is smaller than
    a given threshold, i.e. convergence is achieved, or a maximum number of iterations
    – epocs – are reached. The ANFIS implementation used in this work is taken from
    the Fuzzy logic toolbox (Inc, 2016), by Mathworks where the parameter Radii used
    to train was a scalar of value 0.75 and the average number of epochs used to train
    was 1500. 3. Experimental setup The system was evaluated in three commercial plantations
    of lemon trees in the Region of Murcia, located in the semiarid zone of the South-East
    of Spain where the water is very scarce and drip irrigation is commonly used.
    The irrigation criteria followed was to maximise the yield. Plantation 1. Fino
    lemon trees (Citrus limon L. Burm. Fil cv. 49) on Citrus macrophylla Wester, growing
    in a soil with a low water retention capacity. The soil is characterised by a
    deep and homogeneous sandy – clay – loam texture. The irrigation water had an
    electrical conductivity (EC) of 2200 μS cm−1. The orchard consist of 11 year old
    lemon trees with an average height of 3.5 m. Tree spacing was 7.0 m × 5.5 m, with
    an average ground coverage of about 47%. Two drip irrigation lines (0.8 m apart)
    were used for each tree row. There were 4 emitters (4 L h−1) on both sides of
    each tree. One sensor node was installed in the 5.5 ha orchard, with a soil matric
    potential sensor (MPS-2, Decagon devices, Inc., Pullman, WA 99163 – USA) at a
    depth of 30 cm and three soil moisture sensors at a depth of 20, 40 and 80 cm
    (Enviroscan, Sentek Pty. Ltd., Adelaide, Australia) located 20 cm from a representative
    dripper and 2.25 m from the trunk. According to the nearest weather station of
    SIAM, located about 5 km from the orchard, the climate was typically Mediterranean.
    Thus, over this period (2014), the annual rainfall for the area was 210 mm and
    ET0 was 1395 mm. The average wind speed was 1.66 m/s, generally light wind and
    sometimes moderate. Plantation 2 and 3. 40 and 35 year old lemon trees (C. limon
    L. Burm. Fil) cv. Fino and cv. Verna respectively, grafted on sour orange (Citrus
    aurantium L.), growing in a soil with a medium water retention capacity. The soil
    is clay sandy loam texture and the irrigation water had an electrical conductivity
    (EC) of 1600 μS cm−1 during all season except in summer which was of 2285 μS cm−1.
    The tree spacing was 7.0 m × 6.75 m and 6.75 m × 6.75 m and the average ground
    coverage about 57% and 50%, respectively. One drip irrigation line was used for
    each tree row. There were 8 and 6 emitters of 4 L h−1 per tree, respectively.
    One sensor node was installed in the Fino orchard (≈15 ha) and another in Verna
    orchard (≈23 ha), each with two soil matric potential sensor (MPS-2, Decagon devices,
    Inc., Pullman, WA 99163 – USA) at a depth of 25 and 45 cm and three soil moisture
    sensors at a depth of 25, 45 and 70 cm (10HS, Decagon devices, Inc., Pullman,
    WA 99163) located 20 cm from a representative dripper and the vertical canopy
    projection. According to the nearest SIAM’s weather station, located about 7 km
    from the orchards, the climate was also typically Mediterranean. Over this period
    (2014), the annual rainfall for the area was 150 mm and ET0 was 1250 mm. The average
    wind speed was 1.4 m/s, i.e. light wind generally. The decision of selecting these
    three plantations is based on the fact that all of them are mature lemon trees
    and therefore their water irrigation requirement differences depend mainly of
    environmental conditions (soil and atmosphere) rather than the plant. Besides,
    all the plantations use drip emitters of 4 L h−1 so estimating the irrigation
    runtime of the week instead of the water volume will be a correct approach. Drip
    irrigation provides a fixed volume of water per hour; the pressure is maintained
    using pressure compensating emitters. The Irrigation frequency is calculated taking
    into account that only a certain amount of water depletion is allowed before the
    next replenishment is scheduled. Thus, the run time (gross irrigation dose) is
    determined to be equivalent to the previous amount of water depletion. The experts
    only need to calculate the irrigation run time (minutes) and the number of watering
    times per week or day depending on the time of year or crop development stage.
    The main goal of the system, also reflected by the expert agronomist in his reports,
    is to maximise the yield (maximum production per crop surface) with an optimum
    water management. Since information from the weather stations, soil sensors and
    crops characteristics has different sampling periods, the first step is pre-process
    this information. After analysing several methods and time intervals it was decided
    that the best option was to calculate the week average value for each of the sensors
    or weather stations variable except for the rainfall where the total amount of
    rainfall during the week is used instead. The week average fits better than others
    method like the daily average due to the fact, that the irrigation reports from
    the expert agronomist are already fixed, limited and done weekly. Besides, adding
    more input will make the data sparser, making more difficult to find patterns
    in the feature space, requiring a higher amount of data to train the system accordingly.
    The input obtained will be a one dimensional vector xi for each week in which
    the columns are the different variables or inputs of our system. The target vector
    will be the water requirements of the crops in the following week yi. This information
    has been extracted from the agronomist expert weekly reports in order to be used
    as groundtruth for comparison as for supervising the learning process. Three datasets
    are available, each dataset represent a different plantation. Data was collected
    from January 2014 until June 2015. Each plantation dataset has 74 weeks of data,
    which makes a total of 224 weeks of data. To accomplish a proper analysis of the
    system, we have divided the experiment in two different scenarios. Both scenarios
    differ from the other on the training and testing split. Two machine learning
    methods are applied on each scenario, a method based on PLSR and a method based
    on ANFIS. The performances of both methods in the different scenarios are analysed.
    4. Experimental results and discussion 4.1. Scenario 1 In this scenario, we aim
    to successfully predict the irrigation needs of one or several plantation, based
    on the information provided by the collection device and learned knowledge from
    a historical archive of the previous year irrigation reports. This is of obvious
    usefulness in real life. We will demonstrate this capability by predicting the
    irrigation needs of year 2015 for the three plantations based on the information
    of the year 2014. The training set is therefore composed by all 2014 weeks of
    data belonging the three plantations, while the test set is composed by all 2015
    weeks belonging to the three plantations. The information given to the system,
    or input vector, is a critical part of the design. On the one hand using unnecessary
    features may make the system perform poorly due to redundant information and noise.
    On the other hand, using too few features may not provide all the required information.
    Therefore, among all the available features explained in Table 1, they will not
    all be necessary. Table 3 shows the features subsets selected for each test. Among
    all possible sets of features, only combinations with logical sense, according
    to an expert agronomist were chosen a priori for the different experiments. Performance
    of the different sets is shown in Fig. 6. Table 3. Features subset and variables

    sets of variables for linear regression and ANFIS. The set that accomplish the
    best performance for both methods is F6, with and error of 155.1 and 121.1 min
    week−1 for PLSR and ANFIS respectively. In order to put this error into context,
    it can be noticed that 2.5 extra hours of irrigation represent around 10% of the
    total time in summer months – and up to 20% in spring and autumn months, being
    10% error considered as an acceptable error in agriculture (Bos et al., 2004).
    Therefore, this feature set F6 will be the input vector of the system. It can
    be noticed that including the rain as input of the system (F7), increases the
    error. In the Region of Murcia, the rainfall are extremely low (around 210 mm
    per year) and usually being concentrated in a few days of the year, being the
    weekly total rain in most cases 0. With this information only available for the
    year 2014, the system didn’t have enough information to be trained properly and
    developed in unpredictable results. However we understand that in other regions
    the rainfall could be really useful to increase the performance of the system.
    Besides, considering the water retention capabilities of the soil, part of the
    rainfalls would be considered in the next irrigation report. Fig. 7 shows the
    water irrigation pattern over time predicted by the PLSR and ANFIS respectively
    when using feature set 6. Download : Download high-res image (137KB) Download

    using soil and weather information for the different plantations (Plantation 1:
    Week 1–24, Plantation 2: Week 25–48, Plantation 3: Week 49–72). The weekly errors
    for predicting the irrigation needs during the year 2015 in the three plantations
    are 155.1 and 121.1 min week−1 for PLSR and ANFIS respectively. The standard deviation
    for PLSR is 120.7. In the case of ANFIS, the standard deviation is 105.2. The
    total amount of time needed to irrigate the crops in the three plantations in
    2015 is 65,641 min. ANFIS method estimates this value in 60,506 min and PLSR estimates
    63,240 min. As conclusion, ANFIS performance is better than PLSR for each individual
    week water requirement estimation. However, PLSR estimation also follows the irrigation
    pattern accurately and estimates the total amount of water required more accurately
    over time than ANFIS, which seems to be more conservative in the water usage.
    Looking at the higher peaks of water requirement in the graphs, PLSR may overestimate
    the water needs while ANFIS is more accurate in general. It is important to note
    that in agronomy the most important point is not only the amount of water plants
    need but when they need it (Allen et al., 1998). Following this criterion, the
    performance of ANFIS is much better than PLSR for this scenario. Another factor
    that is important to analyse in this research is the use of soil sensors in addition
    to weather stations to close the loop. We consider that using this kind of sensors
    to estimate the water requirements of the crops improves the accuracy of the estimation
    and helps to deal with local disturbances. Since this is one of our main contributions
    and differences with other proposed automatic irrigation systems, a detailed analysis
    of the contribution of these variables is needed to validate our hypotheses and
    facilitate comparison with previous research systems. Therefore, the input vector
    was changed, using only weather information to train the system and predict the
    irrigation time. Table 4 shows the weekly average error for different sets of
    input vectors. Table 4. Summary of the performance of the different subsets. System

    irrigation pattern using weather information for the different plantations (Plantation
    1: Week 1–24, Plantation 2: Week 25–48, Plantation 3: Week 49–72). The error in
    PLSR using only weather information is 175.3 min week−1 with a standard deviation
    of 147.6. In the case of ANFIS, the error is 159.6 min week−1 with a standard
    deviation of 146.6. Although in general the shape of the graph is quite similar
    to the one using both soil and weather. The use of soil sensors gives a fine adjustment
    increasing the accuracy of the estimation for both PLSR and ANFIS reasoning engines.
    It can be concluded that a much better performance in the weekly irrigation estimation
    (around a 22% smaller weekly average error) is achieved when adding soils sensor
    information to the weather information. Next, a cross-validation strategy is applied
    to the scenario to validate how the results will generalise to an independent
    dataset. In cross validation, the complete dataset of the three plantations is
    divided in training and testing sets. The method used to cross-validate the information
    is Leave one out (LoO CV), a particular case of the Leave-p-out cross-validation
    (LpO CV). Kohavi, 1995, Picard and Cook, 1984 that involves using 1 observation
    as the testing set and the remaining observations as the training set. This process
    is repeated the number of samples times (n) changing the test sample each time
    to validate the system with all the samples. Cross validation method was used
    for both PLSR and ANFIS. Fig. 9 shows the results of this LoO Cross-Validation
    method for PLSR and ANFIS respectively using the set F6 as input vector. Download

    Weeks 105–156 and 205–229). The error in PLSR is 277.8 min week−1 with a standard
    deviation of 153.2. In the case of ANFIS, the error is 87.6 min week−1 with a
    standard deviation of 102.9. The total amount of time needed to irrigate the crops
    for the 189 weeks in the three plantations is 214,020 min. The ANFIS method estimates
    this value on 213,180 min and PLSR estimates 213,960 min. Table 5 summarises the
    result of the experiments. Table 5. Scenario 1 results summary. Results Average

    Similar conclusions are extracted using Cross-Validation. Both PLSR and ANFIS
    systems are really close to the groundtruth in the total amount of water estimated
    but it is clear that ANFIS performs much better than PLSR if we consider the weekly
    error. It is also confirmed that using soil sensors in addition to weather information
    results in a better performance for both ANFIS and PLSR methods. The improvement
    on ANFIS performance during cross validation is explained by the larger amount
    of training data regarding the “predict 2015” experiment. This behaviour is expected
    due to the nature of neural networks, which require large amount of data to be
    trained in comparison with other machine learning techniques and we predict than
    having a historical archive longer for training could results in a further improvement.
    Although we are validating our systems with the three plantations described before
    as case of study, in principle, our methodology has been designed to be independent
    of the crop, terrain and location of the plantation, aiming to propose a general
    close-loop automatic irrigation estimator. In practical terms, this means that
    to apply our system to new plantations, training data in the form of sensor and
    weather weekly data as well as irrigation reports provided by and expert agronomist
    for the new plantation will be needed. Since these reports can be expensive and
    compiling a substantial amount of weekly reports is time consuming and must be
    planned in advance, it is important to know how big the dataset must be and how
    the performance may improve with the number of training weeks. Therefore, as final
    experiment to obtain an estimation of the required amount of training data for
    a new crop/plantation, the complete dataset was divided in different percentages
    of training and testing. Fig. 10 shows the weekly error of both PLSR and ANFIS
    methods with respect to the training dataset percentage. Download : Download high-res
    image (68KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 10. Performance comparison
    for linear regression and ANFIS with respect to the % of samples used to train.
    According to the figure, it is noticeable that ANFIS performance is much better
    than PLSR if there are enough samples to train the system. In cases where the
    percentage of samples for training is low (less than 25% of the data, i.e. less
    than 4 months of data for a given field), PLSR overperforms ANFIS. This case is
    relevant for new plantations without historical data of previous reports. In such
    situations, the PLSR predictive model may be used in early stages, before switching
    to ANFIS once enough samples to train the system properly are collected. 4.2.
    Scenario 2 The goal is to predict the irrigation of a plantation based on its
    weather and soil measured variables but using a SIDSS system trained exclusively
    with other fields. This will be the hardest scenario as it will be necessary to
    predict the irrigation needs of a field with no previous irrigation reports of
    that specific plantation. This scenario attempts to show the potential of our
    methodology to create a universal irrigation estimator of a given crop – in our
    case, lemon trees – for any given plantation, independently of the location and/or
    terrain. A lower performance can be expected in comparison to what could be achieved
    by retraining the system with information of the plantation (scenario 1), which
    is sacrificed for the benefit of not having to generate manual irrigation report
    for new plantations. Cross validation, specifically leave-one_plantation-out is
    applied in validation. Thus, 2014 and 2015 data from two of the plantations are
    used for training, while the remaining plantation data (2014 + 2015) is used for
    testing. This is repeated 3 times, leaving a different plantation out of the training
    set each time, and the results averaged. Table 6 shows the error and standard
    deviation of this scenario for PLSR and ANFIS using different features vector
    used to compare the performance. Table 6. Scenario 2 results summary. Method Features

    156.5 126.9 234.8 192.6 197.4 153.2 The best feature vector F6 used in scenario
    1 is used as input. In this case PLSR outperforms ANFIS with an average error
    of 257.0 min in comparison with 323.3 min for ANFIS. However, we noticed that,
    in this scenario, removing the VWC1 sensor results in a better performance for
    both methods as a universal estimator. This is explained because the VWC sensor
    is very dependent on the soil where it is installed and, as both algorithms were
    trained with a sensor installed in a different plantation than the one that is
    predicting, the provided information introduces noise and does not help the system
    to estimate properly the water need. This does not happen, however, with the SWP
    sensor, which quantifies the tendency of water to move from one area to another
    in the soil and it is less dependent on the soil installed. Removing the VWC sensor
    results in a better performance of the system obtaining an average weekly error
    of 194.4 min with PLSR and 197.4 min with ANFIS. This result proves that there
    is certain potential to develop a universal estimator using our system for a given
    crop, although this means an increase of the average error. This error could be
    reduced if more than 2 plantations of the same crop were available for training.
    Both PLSR and ANFIS performs similarly, being PLSR slightly better. 5. Conclusions
    This paper describes the design and development of an automatic decision support
    system to manage irrigation in agriculture. The main characteristic of system
    is the use of continuous soil measurements to complement climatic parameters to
    precisely predict the irrigation needs the crops, in contrast with previous works
    that are based only on weather variables or doesn’t specify the quantity of water
    required by the crops. The use of real-time information from the soil parameters
    in a closed loop control scheme allows adapting the decision support system to
    local perturbations, avoiding the accumulative effect due to errors in consecutive
    weekly estimation, and/or detecting if the irrigation calculated for the SIDSS
    has been performed by the farmer. The analysis of the performance of the system
    is accomplished comparing the decisions taken by a human expert and the decision
    support component. Two machine learning techniques, PLSR and ANFIS, have been
    proposed as the basis of our reasoning engine and analysed in order to obtain
    the best performance. The experiments have taken place in three commercial plantations
    of citrus trees located in the South-East of Spain. A first experimental scenario
    shows a comparison of the system’s performance using soil sensors in addition
    to the weather information for predicting year 2015 using 2014 information to
    train the system. The usage of soil sensor in the three plantations accomplished
    a 22% less of weekly error in comparison to the performance of using only weather
    information. A second scenario shows the potential of our system as universal
    estimator for a given crop, i.e. the use case of installing the system in a new
    plantation, not having previous information of it. For this application, VWC sensors
    should be removed due to their high dependence with the soil type. Although, as
    expected, the estimation error increases in this scenario, it does not require
    historical data from agronomical reports to be retrained, which implies a significant
    advantage, in particular for new plantations in early stages. If more training
    data from a bigger variety of field were available, a better performance in this
    scenario could be expected. Another possible improvement for this scenario will
    be the addition of a VWC to get a better performance than using only the matric
    potential sensors. However, in order to use the VWC sensor in this scenario, a
    precise study of the soil textures of the plantation will be required to extrapolate
    the VWC sensor information to similar soil textures where the DSS was trained.
    For future research, we aim to extend and evaluate the system in plantations different
    than citrus and analyse the performance under several conditions and regions.
    Thus, adding the weather forecast as input of the SIDSS could help to improve
    the next week irrigation schedule and consider the predicted rainfall in our estimation.
    Similarly, past rainfall information, that did not prove beneficial in our system
    due to the region of Murcia characteristics, may become a good factor to improve
    the accuracy of the system in regions with a more regular and predictable raining
    pattern. We also aim to capture a bigger dataset that will allow us to generate
    more general models towards a universal irrigation estimator of a given crop.
    This dataset will also explore the use of multiple sensors per plantation in order
    to address inhomogeneous ground conditions in the different plantation as well
    as provide more input information to the system for a better reasoning. Acknowledgements

  explanation: The paper delves into the significance of closed-loop control mechanisms
    in autonomous irrigation systems for maintaining optimal irrigation practices
    and resource utilization. It emphasizes the importance of feedback loops and sensor
    data in enabling the system to adjust irrigation schedules based on real-time
    data collected from the field.
  extract_1: '"Feedback control loops ensure irrigation events are scheduled only
    when needed, which is necessary for efficient and effective management of water
    resources." This excerpt highlights the importance of feedback loops in closed-loop
    control mechanisms for autonomous irrigation systems by emphasizing how they guarantee
    irrigation events occur only when required, promoting efficient water resource
    management.'
  extract_2: '"The closed-loop control strategy uses feedback from soil moisture sensors
    to monitor soil water content and adjust the irrigation schedule accordingly."
    This quote demonstrates how the closed-loop control strategy utilizes feedback
    from soil moisture sensors to monitor soil water content, allowing for the precise
    adjustment of the irrigation schedule, optimizing water usage.'

    \ University, Turkey \nWalter W. Buchanan, Texas A&M University, College Station,\
    \ USA \n \n \nABSTRACT \n \nDecision making in most universities is taught within\
    \ the conventional OR/MS (Operations Research/Management \nScience) paradigm.\
    \  This paradigm is known to be “hard” since it is consisted of mathematical tools,\
    \ and normally \nsuitable for solving structured problems. In complex situations\
    \ the conventional OR/MS paradigm proves to be \ninadequate; decisions must be\
    \ based on systems thinking which provides the decision maker(s) the opportunity\
    \ to \naddress the problematic situation in its full system context. The aim here\
    \ is to develop a framework and a new \ncourse to teach “decision making through\
    \ systems thinking” to industrial engineering students. The new course is to \n\
    be taken after the existing course which covers the traditional OR/MS paradigm.\
    \ It is believed that such an \n“extended” framework will help students to improve\
    \ their skills in handling complex decision situations.  \n \nKeywords: Decision\
    \ Making; Systems Thinking; Industrial Engineering Education; OR/MS Paradigm;\
    \ Problem \nStructuring Methods \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \n \nhen decision making\
    \ is taught within the framework of classical management science/operations \n\
    research (MS/OR) paradigm, which sometimes is referred as hard operations research,\
    \ the \nemphasis is usually put on the mathematical tools and techniques. In cases\
    \ where the problematic \nsituation can be clearly described, there are various\
    \ tools available for decision making; such as mathematical \nprogramming, game\
    \ theory, simulation models, Markov chain models, decision tress, etc. However,\
    \ in other cases, \nsuch as in decision situations faced by top managers, there\
    \ may be too much ambiguity about the objective and \ndecision options. Sometimes\
    \ the information and knowledge available to make an effective decision may be\
    \ \nuncertain, incomplete, or even distorted. Under such conditions the problematic\
    \ situation must be described in its \nfull system context. As early as 2005 Jamali\
    \ warned that the existing decision-making processes are no longer \nadequate,\
    \ and urged educational institutions to teach newly developing decision-making\
    \ paradigms (Jamali, 2005). \nIn complex situations there are actors with differing\
    \ goals, preferences, and perceptions. The organizational \nstructure, culture,\
    \ and personal inclinations of managers influence the decision making process.\
    \ The difficulties \ninvolved become more pronounced when there are rapid changes\
    \ in the internal and external dynamics of the \norganization –particularly in\
    \ external dynamics. Organizations can survive and grow only if they can adapt\
    \ \nthemselves to this fast change. The change forces adaptation, and adaptation\
    \ is required in many dimensions \nincluding the existing decision making processes.\
    \  According to Hummelbrunner and Williams (2011), there are \nthree main principles\
    \ in managing complexity: decentralization, collaborative and adaptive management.\
    \ Gorzen-\nMitka, et. al. (2014) defend a similar position, arguing that strategic\
    \ decision-making in complex environments \nrequires meta-cognitive skills and\
    \ a tool-bag for innovative and adaptable decision models beyond linear thinking.\
    \   \n \nComplexity has always been one of the central concepts in systems movement.\
    \ Gorze-Mitka, et.al. (2014) traces the \nroots of “modern complexity” to the\
    \ birth of General Systems Theory which was pioneered by Ludwig von \nBertalanffy.\
    \ The complexity issue was also addressed in Weiner’s work on cybernetics and\
    \ in the work of other \nimportant names in systems movement, such as Churchman,\
    \ Ackoff, Beer, Weinberg, Forrester, and Gigch \n(Skyttner, 2001 and 2006) . Snyder\
    \ (2013) points out that researchers at the Santa Fe Institute attempted to unify\
    \ \nsome of the core system concepts into a model known as complex adaptive systems\
    \ which still is an evolving \nconstruct. It is argued that emergent properties\
    \ of complex systems can be modeled and operated relatively more \neffectively\
    \ as complex adaptive systems. (Aelker, et. al. 2013) and (Satkamaya, et, al,\
    \ 2014)  discuss the approach \nW \nAmerican Journal of Engineering Education\
    \ – June 2016 \nVolume 7, Number 1 \nCopyright by author(s); CC-BY \n20 \nThe\
    \ Clute Institute \nand its applications in some depth. \nThere are various studies\
    \ that specifically address complexity decision making via holistic or systems\
    \ approach. For \ninstance, Sondoss et.al. (2015) handle the complexity in a viticulture\
    \ irrigation management System in South \nAustralia. They present a step-wise\
    \ methodology that integrates qualitative information into formal simulation \n\
    models, involving cognitive mapping and agent based modelling approaches. The\
    \ resulting structure seems to be \ncapturing the richness of decision making\
    \ and mental models. Pagani and Otto (2013) adopts qualitative mapping \ntheory\
    \ building and quantitative group model building approaches in a computer-based\
    \ system modeling \nenvironment for market startegy development. They claim that\
    \ this holistic apparoach enhances the quality of the \ndecision processes.  Carlman,\
    \ et.al. (2014) relate the complexity issue to sustainability in decision making\
    \ processes, \nparticularly in ecological systems.  The decision structure developed\
    \ provides communication and collaboration \nbetween a technical-scientific group\
    \ and social scientists via a holistic outlook. Swami’s work (2013), on the other\
    \ \nhand, views decision making under the broad topic of executive functions or\
    \ cognitive processes that regulate, \ncontrol, and manage other cognitive processes.\
    \ This holistic approach includes theories and concepts from \npsychology, behavioural\
    \ economics, operations research, and managerial practice. Schiuma, et.al. (2012)\
    \ report a \nsystems thinking-based framework where knowledge assets are translated\
    \ into organizational value for making good \ndecisions.  Similarly, Wiek, et.al.’s\
    \ study (2009) presents a framework  called The Transdisciplinary Integrated \n\
    Planning and Synthesis (TIPS), which is mainly based on soft OR methods. This\
    \ particular framework makes use of \na multi-methodological approach involving\
    \ cognitive skills and habits of the stakeholders, and experts and their \nmutual\
    \ and joint transdisciplinary learning processes. This framework was applied in\
    \ a large-scale regional planning \nprocess in Switzerland.  The interested reader\
    \ can find a number of models/methods/systems that have been \ndeveloped to underpin\
    \ sustainable decision-making in environmental impact assessment, life cycle assessment,\
    \ \necological footprints, cost benefit analysis, etc. (Sondoss, et. al., 2015),\
    \ (Carlman, et. al., 2014), (Schiuma, et. al., \n2012), (Petkov, et. al., 2009)\
    \ and (Taylor, et. al., 2011). \n \nThe material in the paper will be presented\
    \ in the following order: the fundamental role of system thinking in \ndecision\
    \ making is assessed in the next section; this will be followed by sections on\
    \ potential contributions of \nsystems thinking in decision making, and the description\
    \ of the framework and the new course developed.  \n \nSystems Thinking and Decision\
    \ Making \n \nSystems thinking developed over the last decades to overcome the\
    \ inadequacies of classical science and to search for \nsolutions to complex problematic\
    \ situations in a holistic manner. Although quite impressive developments occurred\
    \ \nin the last decades, there is still plenty of work to do in systems thinking\
    \ area. Back in 1993, Hitchins (1993) \nsuggested that “the present approach is\
    \ short-lived, rigid, and expensive” – meaning systems thinking. He proposed \n\
    that we should learn from nature, and conceive higher order adaptive systems using\
    \ genetic methods. According to \nhim, adopting an accelerated evolutionary approach\
    \ by building complex adaptive socio-technical systems, without \nfully understanding\
    \ the incomprehensible complex human-system interaction is needed (Hitchins, 2003).\
    \ The 2020 \nvision of Systems Engineering (SE) published by INCOSE (International\
    \ Council on Systems Engineering) also \nsuggests that developments in genetics\
    \ and technology will make significant contributions to SE (INCOSE, 2005). \n\
    Similar views were expressed by other researchers in the past, including Skyttner\
    \ (2001 and 2006). According to \nhim, the old worldview has not been kept up\
    \ to date to take account of contemporary change and the world society \nand its\
    \ institutions are not functioning effectively. He suggests a transformation from\
    \ the reactive view into a \npredictive and anticipatory mode. Despite some shortcomings,\
    \ a variety of significant soft systems methodologies \nhave been developed since\
    \ the 1980s that overcame some of the limitations of the hard school (Jackson,\
    \ 2000 and \n2003), (Maani, et.al. 2007), (Mingers, et.al. 2010), (Mingers, 2010\
    \ and 2011), and (Yurtseven and Buchanan, 2012).  \n \nProbably the most important\
    \ “break away” from the hard school is related to the concept of objectivity.\
    \ The claim of \n“objectivity” of classical science is found to be problematic\
    \ in a soft systems school; it is seen as nothing but an \nillusion.  It is argued\
    \ that it is meaningless to formulate objective aims and objective means in complex\
    \ situations. \nThe actors involved in the process are bound to have different\
    \ perspectives of the problematic situation or the \nreality, and they will highly\
    \ likely suggest different solutions. For instance, Soft Systems Methodology (SSM),\
    \ one \nof the well known methodologies, developed by Checkland, embraces a paradigm\
    \ of learning rather than viewing \nthe world as systems whose performance can\
    \ be optimized by following systematic procedures (Checkland and \nScholes, 1990)\
    \ and (Checkland, 1993). The conventional system methodologies such as System\
    \ Analysis, Systems \nAmerican Journal of Engineering Education – June 2016 \n\
    Volume 7, Number 1 \nCopyright by author(s); CC-BY \n21 \nThe Clute Institute\
    \ \nEngineering, Hard Operations Research, System Dynamics, (Hard) Cybernetics\
    \ are based on systematic procedures. \nThe tendency seen in SSM can also be found\
    \ in other soft methodologies, such as Warfield’s Interactive \nManagement, Churchman’s\
    \ Social Systems Design, Mason and Mitroff’s Strategic Assumption Surfacing and\
    \ \nTesting, Ackoff’s Social Systems Sciences, Senge’s Systems Thinking, Soft\
    \ OR, Soft System Dynamics, and Soft \nCybernetics.  \n \nMethodology Selection\
    \  \n \nOne of the most difficult tasks in a decision-making process is to choose\
    \ the “best” methodology available, like in \nall complex system studies. According\
    \ to Jackson (2003), selection of the appropriate methodology for any type of\
    \ \nsystems study is related the context of the problem - this is obviously true\
    \ also for decision making. Jackson’s view \nis illustrated in Table 1. Here,\
    \ six ideal-type forms of problem context are given by combining the ‘systems’\
    \ and \n‘participants’ dimensions. They are simple-unitary, simple-pluralist,\
    \ simple-coercive, complex-unitary, complex-\npluralist and complex-coercive.\
    \ Jackson (2003) then relates the problem context to different classes of systems\
    \ \nmethodologies as shown in Table 2. Here, the corresponding methodologies are\
    \ classified as (1) Functionalist \nSystems Approach, (2) Interpretive Systems\
    \ Approach, (3) Emancipatory Systems Approach, (4) Postmodern \nSystems Approach,\
    \ and (5) Critical Systems Thinking.  \n \nTable 1. Jackson’s extended version\

    \ \n \nThe reader should note that hard systems thinkers work in that grid of\
    \ problem contexts where it is assumed that \npeople share values and beliefs,\
    \ and that systems are simple enough to be mathematically modeled. The simple-\n\
    unitary approach is known to be successful in tackling a whole variety of operational\
    \ issues (such as, inventory, \nqueuing, scheduling, and routing problems), but\
    \ it fails in complex situations. In complex-unitary situations, System \nDynamics,\
    \ Organizational Cybernetics and Complexity Theory can be useful while complex-pluralistic\
    \ situations \ncan be resolved via soft system approaches. Needless to say, it\
    \ is not possible to draw clear lines between different \nsystems and different\
    \ problem categories as shown in the above tables, but they provide vital clues\
    \ to decision \nmakers. The reader is reminded that Critical Systems Thinking\
    \ is recommended when a variety of methodologies, \nmethods and models need to\
    \ be employed simultaneously in complexity (Jackson 2000 and 2003) and (Flood\
    \ et. al., \n1998).  \n \nThe methodology-problem context issue is also addressed\
    \ by (Kurtz, et.al., 2003). Their framework is is shown in \nTable 3 and known\
    \ as the “Cynefin sense-making framework” (Maani, et.al.,2007). Systems are classified\
    \ as \nKnown, Knowable, Complex and Chaos. The Known systems are systems that\
    \ have perceivable and predictable \ncause-and-effect relationships and can be\
    \ handled via Sense-Categorize-Respond type methodologies (e.g. process \nre-engineering).\
    \ In the Knowable category, cause and effect are separated over time and space,\
    \ and Sense-Analyze-\nRespond type methodologies are suitable - e.g. System Dynamics\
    \ (Maani,et.al., 2007). Complex systems, on the \nother hand, are viewed as systems\
    \ with cause-and-effect relationships that are coherent in retrospect and do not\
    \ \nrepeat; the appropriate methodologies for this category are the Probe-Sense-Respond\
    \ type (e.g. pattern \nmanagement). Cause-and-effect relationships are not perceivable\
    \ in chaotic systems and can be handled only by the \nAct-Sense-Respond approach\
    \ (e.g. crisis management). As mentioned before, drawing clear boundaries between\
    \ \ndifferent classes is not possible. The reader should note that the types of\
    \ decision problems considerd in this study \nfall into the Known and Knowable\
    \ regions. \nAmerican Journal of Engineering Education – June 2016 \nVolume 7,\

    \ \n \nWhen it comes to the classification of decision making methods, Pownall\
    \ (2012) gives us a useful picture. The four \ncategories are: \n \n(a) A qualitative\
    \ perspective which is an integrative approach (or rational normative). \n(b)\
    \ A perspective achieved by combining quantitative and behavioral disciplines\
    \ in an interdisciplinary \nmanner. \n(c) An interlocking perspective where the\
    \ engagement of one perspective limits the use of other \nperspectives. \n(d)\
    \ A cause-effect view where decisions taken are interrelated across organizational\
    \ events. \n \nSystems thinking-based decision making does not exclude perspectives\
    \ (a), (b) and (d). Furthermore, it removes the \nlimitations implied by (c).\
    \  Figure 1 shows the relative positions of different approaches as a function\
    \ of changing \ncomplexity. While sequential decision making (problems are formulated\
    \ as a sequence of “independent” decisions) \nis very algorithmic, appearing at\
    \ the left of the scale, anarchical decision making is far on the right. The RAT\
    \ \n(rational- normative model of decision making) and three-phased (problem identification,\
    \ solution development, and \nsolution selection) models are closer to sequential\
    \ decision making, respectively, and heuristic models are closer to \nthe other\
    \ edge.  \n \nFigure 1. Moving beyond RAT (rational model of decision making)\
    \ (Pownall, 2012). \n \n \n \nThe normative or rational models are based on the\
    \ assumption that all relevant and pertinent information is available \nfor optimal\
    \ decision making–such as in cost-benefit analysis. The three-phased model, on\
    \ the other hand, recognizes \nthat the solution development and solution selection\
    \ are not separate cognitive processes as they are in the RAT \nmodel; these processes\
    \ overlap and can occur simultaneously. Moving to the right in the figure makes\
    \ decision \nprocesses more complicated since cohesive groups emerge in highly\
    \ pressurized and often political context. As one \ngoes towards “Anarchical Decision\
    \ Making” region, the need to make use of heuristic approaches becomes \ninevitable.\
    \ The models here tend to become more “irrational” where human decision values\
    \ are incorporated into the \nRAT \n3 Phase \nHeuristics \nSequential \nDecision\

    23 \nThe Clute Institute \nprocess. The decision maker may incorporate any of\
    \ these models in systems thinking-based approach. \n \nMonte Carlo Modeling can\
    \ also be a useful tool in complex decisions making situations (Pownall 2012,\
    \ Parnell, \net.al. 2011, Taylor III, 2013). The decision maker does not need\
    \ to rely upon measurable input data or subjective \nestimates of likelihoods\
    \ of given events occurring, and does not need to know the assumptions behind\
    \ the patterns \nfor success or failures in the environment. Instead, potential\
    \ outcomes of a decision problem are assigned weights \nvia the use of pseudo\
    \ random numbers, allowing the decision maker to produce decisions without referring\
    \ to the \ndecision context. In this way, the difficulty involved in the explicit\
    \ treatment of uncertainty is avoided, thanks to the \nextensive use of computers.\
    \ Due to its versatility, Monte Carlo modeling is covered in many textbooks today\
    \ \n(Hazelrigg, 1996), (Daellanbach, 2005), (Parnell, et. al. 2011), (Krajewski,\
    \ et. al., 2013) and (Taylor III, 2013).  \n \nThe Framework and New Course Proposed\
    \  \n \nThe following framework is designed to guide instructors in teaching “Decision\
    \ Making” to undergraduate students \nwho are expected to face various different\
    \ situations in industry, whether simple or complex. It is made up of five \n\
    parts: Fundamentals; Rational Models with Quantitative Methods; Rational Models\
    \ with Qualitative Methods; \nHolistic Decision Models; Optional Material. The\
    \ instructor may design a suitable course or a set of courses to \nsatisfy the\
    \ needs of her/his students.  \n \nPart I: The Fundamentals: Introduction to Effective\
    \ Decision Making \n \nThe objective here is to explore the duality of the decision-making\
    \ process, which is partly science and partly art. \nDifferent concepts of rationality\
    \ and the resulting approaches are discussed in general terms, ranging from \n\
    normative rational view to anarchistic and heuristic views. \n \nPart II: Rational\
    \ Models with Qualitative Methods and Analysis \n \nThe main theme here is to\
    \ cover the development of rational models based on forecasting and regression\
    \ techniques. \n \nPart III: Rational Models with Quantitative Methods and Analysis\
    \ \n \nThis section covers methods based on probability theory, such as decision\
    \ trees and related decision analysis and \nqueuing theory. \n \nPart IV: Holistic\
    \ Decision Models \n \nThis part starts with the Fundamentals of Systems Thinking\
    \ and provides an introduction to soft system \nmethodologies. Some case studies\
    \ will be discussed to demonstrate the strengths of system thinking-based decision\
    \ \nmaking. Selection of case studies and the methodology or methodologies will\
    \ depend on the instructor’s choice.  \n \nPart V: Optional Material \n \nHeuristic\
    \ Decision Making and Group Decision Making: This section includes the fundamentals\
    \ of decision making \napproaches that emphasize cognitive, heuristic, and group\
    \ behavior aspects (Pownall, 2012).  \n \nKnowledge Management and Decision Enhancing\
    \ Decision Making (Optional): The objective in this section is to \nteach the\
    \ fundamentals of knowledge management concepts, and (intelligent) decision support\
    \ systems, together \nwith the relevant IT. The technological aspects of this\
    \ topic may be found at (Muller, et. al., 2014), (Khan, et. .al. \n2014), (Laudon,\
    \ et.al, 2013) and (Kendall, et. al. 2011).         \n \nThe syllabus of the new\
    \ course designed in this study is as follows: \n \nCourse Code and Title: IEN\

    24 \nThe Clute Institute \nCourse Objectives: The aim in this course is to teach\
    \ systems thinking-based decision making techniques in complex \nsituations. First,\
    \ major systems concepts are covered, followed by a discussion of the basics of\
    \ systems thinking. \nNext, a comparative view of hard and soft systems thinking,\
    \ issues in methodology selection and an overview of \nCritical Systems Thinking\
    \ are presented. The rest of the course is dedicated to discussion of case studies\
    \ where \ndecision making takes place in complex environments. Most of the case\
    \ studies presented make use of System \nDynamics approach where hard and soft\
    \ modeling approaches are combined \n \nLearning Objectives: (1) To develop a\
    \ satisfactory background in systems thinking and soft systems thinking; (2) to\
    \ \nlearn major system concepts; (3) To learn how to develop the description of\
    \ a complex decision making situation in \na system context; (3) How to develop\
    \ a model of a complex situation via hard and soft modeling approaches;(4) \n\
    How to produce a decision via an appropriate system methodology or methodologies.\

    \ \nIn any methodology, problem structuring or description of the problematic\
    \ situation is a very important step. The \ndecision maker needs to know the major\
    \ system concepts to develop a satisfactory description of the problematic \n\
    situation. The important system concepts such as system boundary, types of systems\
    \ and models (discrete \n/continouos \nsystems, \ndeterministic/stochastic \n\
    systems, \nlinear/non-linear \nsystems, \nclosed/open \nsystems), \nfeedforward/feedback\
    \ loops, open-loop/closed-loop control mechanisms, transient/steady-state behavior,\
    \ emergent \nbehavior, system hierarchies and system response lags are covered\
    \ early in the course. Students need to understand \nthe diagrams shown in Figure\
    \ 2.a and 2.b; they provide a comparison of problem structuring by the hard OR\
    \ \nmethodology and Systems Thinking (Daellanbach, 2005). While System S (the\
    \ narrow system of interest) and \nSystem M (the modeling system) are separate\
    \ in the hard OR methodology, System S is defined within System M in \nthe soft\
    \ approaches. This makes a significant difference in problem structuring or problem\
    \ formulation, suggesting \nthat soft systems approaches have a better chance\
    \ of being successful. The reader should also note the inputs used in \nthe definition\
    \ of System S. In addition to boundary judgments, controllable and uncontrollable\
    \ inputs, similar to case \nin the hard OR methodology, there is a richer group\
    \ of inputs in the soft systems approach. Inputs such as \ntechnology, facilitation,\
    \ problem structuring, reflective thinking and commitment for action allow the\
    \ decision \nmaker to capture the problematic situation in its full system context.\
    \  \n \nSeveral tools such as mind maps, rich picture diagrams, and cognitive\
    \ maps will also be taught in the course are \navailable for structuring a problematic\
    \ situation. Good problem structuring requires good system boundary selection,\
    \ \nwhich fixes the scope, providing direction and focus for all subsequent analysis.\
    \  Poor boundary selection may have \nserious consequences, particularly as far\
    \ as people affected by the decision and the resources involved. Furthermore,\
    \ \na holistic perspective given in Figure 2.b allows the decision makers to see\
    \ unplanned and counterintuitive outcomes \nwith relative ease and help to evaluate\
    \ the consequences. \n \nIn the modeling section, students will learn how to include\
    \ soft indicators together with hard indicators (key \nperformance indicators\
    \ or critical success factors). The soft indicators include such things as morale,\
    \ commitment, \nburnout, care for customers and capacity for learning. Last but\
    \ not the least, system simulation is certainly one of the \npowerful tools for\
    \ conducting what-if analysis to make a good decision. Simulation models based\
    \ on System \nDynamics methodology are very popular in policy analysis, and in\
    \ scenario and strategy development. There are \nquite a number of successful\
    \ applications of the System Dynamics methodolgy in complex ecological systems,\

    \ large-scale healthcare systems (Maani, et.al., 2007, Aelker, et.al, 2013, Mingers,\
    \ et.al. 2010, \nYurtseven, et.al, 2012). \n \nIn short, the hard OR/MS paradigm\
    \ needs to be complemented by soft system approaches in university education.\
    \ \nThis will broaden the vision of students and help them handle complex decision\
    \ problems with confidence. Soft \nmethodologies cover a wide range of approaches\
    \ that hard methodologies cannot capture. This new course has not \nbeen taught\
    \ in the form as described here yet. It will be offered in the coming academic\
    \ year. However, a positive \nresponse was received from the fourth year industrial\
    \ engineering students when some material on system life cycle \nmodels in the\
    \ Fundamentals of Systems Engineering course was replaced by the introductory\
    \ material of this \nproposed course (items #1to 5 in the new syllabus). The objective\
    \ of Fundamentals of Systems Engineering is to \nteach the analysis and design\
    \ of industrial and socio-economic systems. It is compulsory and the remaining\
    \ part of \nthe course is based on the applications of system dynamics methodology.\
    \ It is believed that students’ positive \nresponse to the change was primarily\
    \ related to its relevance. They were able to integrate this material into industrial\
    \ \nengineering profession as opposed to the fairly abstract material on system\
    \ life-cycle methodology. Surely this \ninitial information is not sufficient\
    \ to judge whether the new approach is more or less successful. Like any other\
    \ new \ncourse, particularly if it is not a conventional one, it has to be taught\
    \ at least three times to measure its educational \neffectiveness. The results\
    \ from the second offer of the course may not also be fully reliable since there\
    \ tends to be \nsome minor changes after the first offer. The next phase in this\
    \ research work is to redesign the Socio-Technical \nSystem Design course accordingly.\
    \ This is an elective course. Highly likely this course will be primarily based\
    \ on \nSoft Systems Methodology. \n  \nFigure 2a. Structure diagram for hard OR\

    A new framework was developed and a new course was designed for teaching decision\
    \ making to undergraduate \nstudents in this study. It was argued that the traditional\
    \ or hard OR/MS paradigm is adequate for handling simple \nand structured decision\
    \ making problems, but insufficient in complex situations. This weakness was overcome\
    \ by \nexpanding the traditional framework to include systems thinking-based methodologies.\
    \ It was further argued that, \nthrough Systems Thinking, and through some soft\
    \ methodologies, it is possible to develop a rich and a structured \ndescription\
    \ of a messy problematic situation. This approach will help students in describing\
    \ a complex problematic \nsituation in a system context, and developing a satisficing\
    \ decision through consensus within a pluralist environment \n- they will not\
    \ be searching for an optimal solution for a simplified version of the complex\
    \ reality. Future research \nwill be directed towards measuring the degree of\
    \ success of the new course in industrial engineering education via \nthe learning\

    Get rights and content Abstract Irrigation scheduling answers the question of
    when to irrigate and how much. The techniques used for scheduling include the
    monitoring of soil moisture, physiological indicators and water balance models.
    The areas of major concern are: (a) a soil moisture sensor which is inexpensive,
    rapid and accurate; (b) a means of assessing the upper and lower limits of soil
    water content in the changing root zone; (c) development of a rapid technique
    for estimating leaf area; and (d) a means of measuring canopy transpiration. A
    major research thrust that can be identified is the separation of evaporation
    from the soil surface and transpiration by the canopy. As one manipulates the
    canopy geometry to assess the cultural practices and irrigation systems, the need
    to clearly identify the contribution of evaporation and transpiration becomes
    increasingly important. The objective for irrigation for the farmer is to maximize
    his net returns. There are three components of an economic model for determining
    that decision: (a) a water balance; (b) a growth response function; and (c) an
    economic optimization function. A few of the problem areas in such a scheme are:
    (a) adaptation by the plant to water stress; (b) dynamics of the root system;
    (c) interaction between fertility and water; and (d) risk analysis. References

    \ Precision agricultural greenhouse systems indicate considerable scope for improvement\n\
    of irrigation management practices, since growers typically irrigate crops based\
    \ on their personal\nexperience. Soil-based greenhouse crop irrigation management\
    \ requires estimation on a daily basis,\nwhereas soilless systems must be estimated\
    \ on an hourly or even shorter interval schedule. Historically,\nirrigation scheduling\
    \ methods have been based on soil or substrate monitoring, dependent on climate\n\
    or time with each having both strengths and weaknesses. Recently, plant-based\

    plant-water-soil relationships. This article presents a comprehensive review of\
    \ the literature, which\ndeals with irrigation scheduling approaches applied for\

    1. Introduction\nThe concept of “precision agriculture” is used to deﬁne technologies\
    \ that support customized\nagricultural practices aimed at higher eﬃciency and\
    \ a lower impact on the environment [1]. Greenhouse\nproduction systems decrease\
    \ crop water requirements by as much as 20% to 40% compared to open\nﬁeld cultivation;\
    \ however, growers routinely apply more irrigation water than the estimated water\n\
    consumption [2–4]. Irrigation practices are generally based on the personal perspective\
    \ of the grower;\ni.e., irrigation without monitoring the soil or plant water\
    \ status [5]. Considering the number of diﬀerent\nplant species grown in prevailing\
    \ greenhouse environments, the types of substrate and container sizes,\nﬁeld and\
    \ soil characteristics, and the diﬀerent irrigation systems, it becomes obvious\
    \ why irrigation\nscheduling becomes complex if it is to be achieved with any\
    \ level of precision [6–8]. Therefore, an\naccurate short term estimation of crop\
    \ water requirements in protected cultivation are a prerequisite\nfor optimal\
    \ irrigation scheduling; as evapotranspiration (ETC) could occur so rapidly that\
    \ water loss\ncan cause plant damage before wilting symptoms become visible [9,10].\
    \ Irrigation management is\ntypically expected to achieve maximum water supply\
    \ for plant growth and production, with soil or\nsubstrate water content being\
    \ maintained close to ﬁeld capacity [11].\nEven in soilless cultivation systems,\
    \ irrigation represents a very large and potentially important\nloss of nutrients\
    \ and a source of environmental pollution (i.e., drain to waste hydroponics systems)\
    \ as a\nHorticulturae 2019, 5, 7; doi:10.3390/horticulturae5010007\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/horticulturae\n\
    Horticulturae 2019, 5, 7\n2 of 20\nsurplus of 20% to 50% of the plant’s water\
    \ uptake in each irrigation cycle is often recommended [12–16].\nIndeed, annual\
    \ use of irrigation water ranges from 150 to 200 mm (e.g., leafy vegetable) in\
    \ soil-based\ngreenhouse crops to 1000 to 1500 mm in soilless-grown (e.g., Solanaceae,\
    \ cucurbits) [11]. For container\nnursery production, as cited by Fulcher et al.\
    \ [17], those values could be as high as 2900 mm.\nConsidering the scarcity of\
    \ water resources combined with the operational energy irrigation costs,\nmaintaining\
    \ the sustainable use of water is a major water-climate policy challenge since\
    \ excessive\nirrigation results in low water use eﬃciency, increases in runoﬀ\
    \ and contributes to higher CO2\nemissions [18–20]. Several institutions have\
    \ worked to improve water use in irrigation, developed\nvarious models of water\
    \ eﬃciency, reducing the environmental problems associated with irrigation in\n\
    order to mitigate severe structural water deﬁcits, yet these models are not commercialized\
    \ [4,21].\nThis paper presents a review of the literature dealing with irrigation\
    \ of greenhouse crops. The\nnecessity, the advantages and the limitations of each\
    \ irrigation approach used are discussed in relation\nto diﬀerent greenhouse types\
    \ and the ability of an irrigation controller unit to support a feedback\nirrigation\
    \ decision system.\n2. Background\nThe exact time and volume of irrigation are\
    \ probably the most important factors for eﬃcient\nirrigation management and saving\
    \ water, and these in turn also improve the productivity and quality\nof crops\
    \ grown in the greenhouse [22,23]. This is especially true as the high potential\
    \ eﬃciency\nof fertigation (i.e., irrigation combined with fertilization) has\
    \ become a routine cultural practice,\ntherefore the terms “irrigation” and “fertigation”\
    \ are often used interchangeably [24–27]. Yet, irrigation\nmanagement of substrate-based\
    \ greenhouse crops still requires much more accurate control than for\nthe same\
    \ crop grown in soil, taking into account that substrates have very little nutrient\
    \ buﬀering\ncapacity [28].\nSoilless growth systems in readily made artiﬁcial\
    \ media commonly use organic (i.e., coconut coir,\npeat moss, pine bark) or inert\
    \ substrates (i.e., perlite, rockwool, vermiculite); with substrate volume at\n\
    approximately 10 to 40 L m−2 as is the case of rockwool or perlite slabs [29,30].\
    \ Horticultural production\nhas historically been increasingly based on those\
    \ ready-made substrates produced on an industrial\nscale with unique characteristics\
    \ such as a limited cation exchange and low buﬀering capacity, good\nwater permeability\
    \ and adequate aeration [31]. Compared to soil cultivation systems, soilless growth\n\
    systems are superior for plant growth as less energy is required by plants to\
    \ extract water at ﬁeld\ncapacity, therefore experiencing a lower risk of oxygen\
    \ deﬁciency [32,33]. In the same manner, all\ncontainerized production systems\
    \ can be considered as hydroponic (i.e., soilless growth system) since\nthey consist\
    \ of an artiﬁcial root zone aimed at optimizing water and nutrient availability\
    \ [34]. However,\nthe restricted root volume may negatively aﬀect the supply of\
    \ nutrients to the plants as the water in\nthe substrate may be rapidly decreased\
    \ [32,35–37]. In addition, changes are induced in air and water\nretention characteristics\
    \ of organic and inorganic substrates when they are used for longer periods\n\
    than one growing season [38,39]. Therefore, according to Deepagoda et al. [29],\
    \ a porous media should\npreferably be inert to prevent chemical and biological\
    \ interactions.\nIrrespective of the type of greenhouse cultivation system used\
    \ (i.e., soil or soilless), irrigation\nscheduling should be managed (I) to supply\
    \ plants with the volume of water equal to the volume of\ntranspired water for\
    \ maintaining crop productivity, (II) to overcome the diﬀerences in water discharge\n\
    achieving high water uniformity (III) to move excessive salts towards the rooting\
    \ system, avoiding\nsoil salination [30,40]. Even in the latter case, for greenhouse\
    \ cultivation systems there is always a\nrisk of erroneous choices in the matching\
    \ irrigation supply to crop evapotranspiration, as it may be\naﬀected by sudden\
    \ changes in outside weather conditions or the use of climate control systems\
    \ such\nas heating and ventilation [41]. That is another reason why for open hydroponic\
    \ systems the main\nirrigation strategy is to supply nutrient solutions, with\
    \ a surplus of 30% to 50% of the water uptake by\nthe plants [14].\nHorticulturae\
    \ 2019, 5, 7\n3 of 20\nThe leaching requirement in greenhouse soil-grown cultivation\
    \ can be estimated based on\nirrigation water salinity and crop salt tolerance\
    \ following FAO [42] as below:\nLR =\nECiw\n5ECe − ECiw\n,\n(1)\nwhere LR is the\
    \ minimum leaching requirement needed to control salts within the tolerance ECe\
    \ of the\ncrop; ECiw is the electrical conductivity of the irrigation water applied\
    \ (dS m−1); and, ECe the average\nsoil salinity tolerated by the crop as measured\
    \ on a soil saturation extract (dS m−1).\nHowever, as cited by Ben-Gal et al.\
    \ [43], traditional guidelines for the calculation of the crop-speciﬁc\nleaching\
    \ requirement is imprecise due to failure to consider soil type, climate, or salinity-induced\n\
    reduction in plant transpiration. Such omissions could possibly result in underestimating\
    \ actual\nleaching and over-estimation of leaching requirements.\nMicro-irrigation\
    \ is often promoted as a technology that can increase the application eﬃciency\n\
    of water, and improve crop production and quality. The sub irrigation system also\
    \ applies for the\nproduction of many ornamental hydroponic crops. However, the\
    \ tendency for salts to build up in\nthe upper portion of the root zone represents\
    \ a drawback [44,45]. Harmanto et al. [46] working with\nsoil-based greenhouse\
    \ tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum) in a tropical environment indicated that by\n\
    applying drip irrigation, the water savings inside the greenhouse could be as\
    \ much as 20% to 25%\nhigher compared to an open ﬁeld drip irrigated farming system.\n\
    For scheduling irrigation in soil or soilless greenhouses, it is essential to\
    \ estimate the crop\nevapotranspiration and, according to the soil or substrate,\
    \ the irrigation dose. In addition, as cited\nin Incrocci et al. [16], the irrigation\
    \ dose of container growing medium could be estimated based on\nwater potential\
    \ or volumetric water content, with the use of soil moisture sensors. In the meantime,\n\
    the adoption of soil moisture monitoring in vegetables has been restricted by\
    \ means of sensor accuracy\nand price as well as labor required for installation,\
    \ removal, and collection of readings [7]. A recent\nreview by Bianchi et al.\
    \ [47] summarized the four macro-groups of soil water potential devices and\n\
    their operational characteristics.\nAccording to Cahn and Johnson [7], an advantage\
    \ of tension thresholds is the lesser inﬂuence by\nsoil texture in comparison\
    \ to volumetric moisture thresholds. Even so, as cited by Nikolaou et al. [48],\n\
    sensors that estimate dielectric capacitance or dielectric permittivity of substrates\
    \ (e.g., time domain\nreﬂectometry, frequency domain) have a propensity to be\
    \ more reliable for soilless culture systems, as\nopposed to sensors measuring\
    \ water availability through the matric potential such as the tensiometers.\n\
    According to Baille [49], in the short-term, decision level irrigation can be\
    \ triggered based either\non greenhouse microclimate or on soil/substrate moisture\
    \ status. Irrigation scheduling based on direct\nor indirect measurement of plant\
    \ water status and plant physiological responses to drought by using\nplant-based\
    \ methods was comprehensively reviewed by several authors [50,51]. The diﬀerent\
    \ methods\nof irrigation scheduling in greenhouses is summarized below (Table\

    \ Monitoring Irrigation in Greenhouse Crops\nIrrigation scheduling may have an\
    \ impact on crop water productivity, aﬀecting fruit yield and\nquality as well\
    \ [76–78]. However, the targeted performance of a crop is largely situational;\
    \ as irrigation\nmight also be used as a tool for increasing water use eﬃciency,\
    \ for maximizing yield or economic\nreturn [79].\nFor soil-based greenhouse cucumber\
    \ (Cucumis sativus), Alomran [77] indicated that applying\ndeﬁcit irrigation at\
    \ speciﬁc crop stages with 80% ETC (i.e., decrease irrigation water up to 40%\
    \ ETC) is\nthe most appropriate irrigation strategy for high crop water productivity\
    \ and yield. For greenhouse\ntomatoes, partial root drying resulted in a water\
    \ savings of 50%, but negatively aﬀected the total fruit\nand total dry mass.\
    \ However, the considerable savings of water could make partial root drying feasible\n\
    in areas where water is scarce and expensive [80].\nFor soilless greenhouse cucumber,\
    \ between transplanting and ﬂowering, irrigation should be\nscheduled so as to\
    \ induce slight water stress and increase root growth, while tomatoes should be\n\
    stressed for a longer period (i.e., about three weeks) in order to set the ﬁrst\
    \ and second trusses [81].\nIn addition, several authors [53,60,82–84] indicated\
    \ that increasing the irrigation intervals in soilless\nculture with the same\
    \ daily amount of water applied positively inﬂuenced crop growth and production\n\
    and minimized the outﬂow of water and nutrients from the greenhouse into the environment.\
    \ However,\nthat is not always the case, because results are often crop and substrate\
    \ speciﬁc, and are also dependent\non the experimental conditions and the limiting\
    \ growth factor(s) [85].\nA more rational approach for optimizing irrigation is\
    \ through automatic irrigation controllers.\nTherefore, irrigation management\
    \ approaches may be categorized according to the ability of a controller\nunit\
    \ to support a feedback system [86]. Irrigation operations are often automated\
    \ by using timers,\nspecialized controllers, or computer control [87]. In the\
    \ simplest form of automation in an “open loop\nirrigation control system”, no\
    \ measurements of the system outputs are used to modify the inputs\nand irrigation\
    \ is based on preset time intervals (i.e., time clock scheduling) [86,88,89].\
    \ In a “feedback\nbased irrigation closed-loop control system”, the system provides\
    \ growers with output data in real\ntime (i.e., percentage of drainage, plant\
    \ water status) which are evaluated in order to reschedule or\nperform irrigation.\
    \ In a “feed forward irrigation control system” water uptake is predicted by using\n\
    growth and transpiration models [14,71]. In addition, computerized-controlled\
    \ irrigation systems\ncan utilize a range of data to achieve accurate delivery\
    \ of water according to crop requirements [71].\nThese systems are often mentioned\
    \ as a fuzzy-logic control system, artiﬁcial intelligent system or\nmulticriterion\
    \ decision-making system. They are gaining importance because of their inherent\
    \ ability\nto judge alternative scenarios for the selection of the best alternative\
    \ which may be further analyzed\nbefore implementation [90].\n2.2. The Soil/Substrate\
    \ Physical Properties and the Irrigation Dose\nEvapotranspiration rates depend\
    \ on greenhouse environmental conditions, and are also aﬀected\nby the water supply\
    \ to the roots [91]. For scheduling irrigation, hydraulic properties and water\
    \ content\ndependence on substrate suction must be known as they inﬂuence the\
    \ water movement and retention\nin the substrate [91–93]. Water retention curves\
    \ or moisture characteristic curves relate the water\ncontent in a speciﬁc substrate\
    \ to the matric potential at a given tension or height [94]. Diﬀerent kinds\n\
    of substrates, as Fields et al. [95] indicated, have diﬀerent water retention\
    \ curves (Figure 1).\nHorticulturae 2019, 5, 7\n6 of 20\nHorticulturae 2019, 5,\

    \ \nFrom Figure 1, we can observe that the easily available water content (i.e.,\
    \ water released \nbetween 1 and 5 kPa) in coir is higher in comparison to pine\

    \ for applying a high frequency irrigation program. In \naddition, a taller container\

    \ Irrigation should take into account indices related to substrate availability\

    \ rather than on the water volume in the \ncontainer. By measuring water contents\
    \ at different pressure heads, the soil water retention function \ncan be determined.\
    \ However, the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity measurement is often difficult\
    \ \nas it may require expensive equipment [91,94,98]. The reason is because substrates\

    \ cycles resulted in changes \nin air to water ratios. Additionally, shrinkage\
    \ and compaction of substrates generates problems with \nwatering, hydration,\

    \ easily available water content (i.e., water released between\n1 and 5 kPa) in\
    \ coir is higher in comparison to pine bark; therefore, the crop may absorb more\
    \ available\nwater, reducing the need for applying a high frequency irrigation\
    \ program. In addition, a taller\ncontainer proportionately holds less water,\
    \ as a percentage of water content by volume. Irrigation\nshould take into account\
    \ indices related to substrate availability of water, to container geometry and\n\
    to speciﬁc substrate characteristics [64]. In general, water held by tensions\
    \ higher than 10 kPa are\nconsidered unavailable to the crop, and water held between\
    \ 5 to 10 kPa tensions are referred to as the\nsubstrate water buﬀer capacity.\
    \ The available water in the container can be estimated according to\nBaudoin\
    \ as follows [96]:\nAWcont. = +0.64AW + 0.30P − 67h + 4.1,\n(2)\nwhere AW is the\
    \ water that is available in a speciﬁc substrate as obtained from the water release\

    \ (m).\nHowever, according to Raviv [97], water and nutrient availability to plants\
    \ depends on the actual\nmoisture ﬂux from the medium to the plant roots rather\
    \ than on the water volume in the container.\nBy measuring water contents at diﬀerent\
    \ pressure heads, the soil water retention function can be\ndetermined. However,\
    \ the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity measurement is often diﬃcult as it may\n\
    require expensive equipment [91,94,98]. The reason is because substrates containing\
    \ predominantly\norganic components decompose during crop production cycles resulted\
    \ in changes in air to water ratios.\nAdditionally, shrinkage and compaction of\
    \ substrates generates problems with watering, hydration,\nand generally leads\
    \ to worsening the air to water relationship [99,100]. In the same way, hydraulic\n\
    conductivity of rockwool and similar substrates is high when well-watered, but\
    \ declines drastically as\nit dries out and plants experience a water deﬁcit [101].\n\
    Mavrogianopoulos [65] proposed a simple equation for the estimation of the irrigation\
    \ dose based\non substrate characteristics as below:\nQ = Y × WW × N\n(1 − dr)\n\
    ,\n(3)\nwhere Q is the irrigation dose (L slab−1); Y is the water holding capacity\
    \ of the substrate inside the\nslab (L slab−1); Ww is the percentage of the water\
    \ holding capacity that is easily available water (%); N\nHorticulturae 2019,\
    \ 5, 7\n7 of 20\nrepresents a critical percentage of the easily available water\
    \ that when reached, irrigation should start\n(i.e., typical values between 5%\
    \ to 35%); dr is the percentage of drainage (%).\nAccording to the same author,\
    \ the substrate water holding capacity could be estimated by weighing\nit when\
    \ dry, then ﬁlling it up with water for up to 24 h to complete the wetting process,\
    \ draining up to\n12 h, and reweighing it. The diﬀerence in weight is the water\
    \ holding capacity, in kg slab−1 or L slab−1;\nhowever, this procedure should\
    \ be repeated at diﬀerent stages throughout plant growth.\nIn addition, another\
    \ equation for estimating the irrigation dose was proposed by Katsoulas [82],\n\
    taking into account the crop transpiration rate plus an extra amount of water\
    \ for leaching purposes.\nThis method simply reﬂects the substrate inﬂuence on\
    \ crop water uptake, but requires frequent\nmeasurements of crop’s transpiration\
    \ rates.\nE =\nTr\n(1 − D),\n(4)\nTr = ζRGo,\n(5)\nζ = Kcτα\nλ\n,\n(6)\nwhere\
    \ E is the amount of water applied in (Kg m−2); Tr is the crop transpiration (kg\
    \ m−2); Kc is the\nspecies-speciﬁc crop coeﬃcient; τ is the greenhouse radiation\
    \ transmission coeﬃcient; RGo is the solar\nradiation measured outside the greenhouse\
    \ (Kj m−2); a is the evaporation coeﬃcient; λ is the latent heat\nof vapourization\
    \ of water (kJ kg−1); and D is the drainage rate equal to 50% of irrigation water\
    \ apply.\nFor greenhouse soil-based cultivation the amount of water which is “available”\
    \ for root water\nuptake is deﬁned as the amount of soil water between ﬁeld capacity\
    \ (i.e., soil matric pressure −10 or\n−33 kPa) and the permanent wilting point\
    \ (i.e., −1500 kPa) expressed in m of water per m of soil depth.\nHowever, besides\
    \ its use in irrigation management, ﬁeld capacity is not an adequate soil physical\n\
    quantity to assess soil water availability to crops, as a considerable (10% to\
    \ 50%) fraction of transpired\nwater is acquired from the soil at water contents\
    \ above ﬁeld capacity [102].\nThe most common values for typical soil texture\
    \ classes are cited by Snider [103] in Table 2.\nTable 2. Average values of available\
    \ water holding capacity of the main soil texture groups (cm of\nwater per cm\

    \ available soil moisture within the rooting zone has attained a predeﬁned level\
    \ of\navailable water (i.e., the management allowable deﬁcit—MAD), irrigation\
    \ is triggered. The estimation\nof MAD is diﬃcult because it depends on plant\
    \ species and the evaporative conditions [104]. In general,\nthe MAD can be calculated\
    \ as a percentage of the available water, usually 30% to 50% in soil and 10%\n\
    in soilless cropping systems. Then, the irrigation dose can be calculated by multiplying\
    \ the MAD\nwith a coeﬃcient with typical values from 1.15 to 2, to account for\
    \ water application uniformity and\nsalinity. Typically, the frequency of irrigation\
    \ can be estimated when the accumulated daily ETC for\nthe periods between irrigations\
    \ approaches the MAD [96]. In line with this, the irrigation frequency\nof greenhouse\
    \ soil cultivations can be estimated by dividing the readily available water with\
    \ crop\nevapotranspiration [68].\nHorticulturae 2019, 5, 7\n8 of 20\nZeng et al.\
    \ [23], working with drip-irrigated greenhouse soil cultivation of muskmelon,\
    \ deﬁned\nthe irrigation dose by measuring the soil water content daily. When\

    \ − DW\nDW\n× 100,\n(8)\nwhere Ir represents the water amount by the drip irrigation\

    \ of the soil which is irrigated in accordance with the vegetative\nstage; θfc\
    \ is the water ﬁeld capacity (32.9%); g1 is the irrigation application rate (%);\
    \ g2 is the irrigation\nstart point (60%); IE is the irrigation eﬃciency; SWC\
    \ is the soil water content (%); FW is the fresh\nweight; and, DW is the dry weight.\n\
    3. Open and Feed Forward Irrigation Control System\n3.1. Time Clock Scheduling\
    \ and the Accumulated Radiation Method\nIn greenhouses with no feedback system\
    \ control (i.e., open loop system), irrigation scheduling is\ndetermined according\
    \ to the grower’s perspective. Usually growers use a standard irrigation dose\
    \ and\nchange the frequency of irrigation; thus, they automate irrigation only\
    \ on the basis of time [8,88]. For\nsoil-based greenhouse crops the irrigation\
    \ frequency is usually on a daily basis under warm and sunny\nconditions, and\
    \ every 3–4 days under cooler and cloudy conditions [28]. In soilless systems,\
    \ irrigation\nusually starts one hour after sunrise and stops one hour before\
    \ sunset, with hourly or even shorter\nirrigation intervals during a day under\
    \ high radiation conditions. For some substrates (i.e., rockwool)\nnight irrigation\
    \ is also recommended, avoiding drying to account for crop transpiration [105,106].\
    \ In\nline with this, according to Schröder and Lieth [81], irrigation at night\
    \ is advised if the moisture content\nof the substrate has fallen below 8% to\
    \ 10% from the previous morning. However, those rules-of-thumb\nobviously do not\
    \ apply when the weather conditions are changing quickly from day to day [52,107].\n\
    Lizarraga et al. [52] evaluated the eﬃciency of timed scheduling, and concluded\
    \ that this method does\nnot actually meet the irrigation requirements of hydroponic\
    \ tomatoes resulting in over and under\nirrigation during the morning and in the\
    \ afternoon, respectively. Similarly, Incrocci et al. [16], working\nwith several\
    \ species of ornamentals in container nursery crops, reported an increase of the\
    \ water use\nwith timed irrigation scheduling by 20% to 40% and nutrient emissions\
    \ of 39% to 74% in comparison\nwith model-based irrigation.\nA more rational approach\
    \ for irrigation scheduling is the accumulated radiation method, allowing\nmore\
    \ closely matched water supply to the ET rate, which is primarily a day time phenomenon\n\
    depending strongly on solar radiation [14,69,89,108,109]. However, Shin et al.\
    \ [110] indicated that the\ntranspiration rate of soilless paprika (Capsicum annuum)\
    \ plants did not proportionally increase with an\nincrease in light intensity,\
    \ especially in high light conditions.\nFor estimating how much energy the crop\
    \ has received, a light sensor (e.g., pyranometer) is used\nto measure incident\
    \ solar radiation. Once this has been intercepted, a threshold value of light\
    \ energy,\nan irrigation event, is triggered. Schröder and Lieth [81] suggested\
    \ light sums inside greenhouses\nbetween 0.4 and 0.6 MJ m−2 in closed and 1.4\
    \ and 1.8 MJ m−2 in open hydroponic cultures with\ndrainage volume factors of\
    \ 30% and 15%, respectively. However, for rockwool substrate in a free\ndrainage\
    \ system, Lee [111] recommended accumulated values of 0.8 MJ m−2 with a minimum\
    \ rest\ntime set (i.e., not irrigated if the target value is reached) between\
    \ 20 min in bright and 50 min on dark\ndays according to the crop growth phase.\
    \ Additionally, for bell pepper in container growth with peat\nmix, perlite, and\
    \ pine bark media, Jovicich et al. [61] indicated that the ﬁrst-quality fruit\
    \ weight was\nenhanced at solar radiation integral levels of 0.34 MJ m−2, while\
    \ Lizarraga et al. [52] proposed indoor\nvalues of 0.81 MJ m−2 for tomatoes grown\
    \ in perlite in bags of 40 L. In addition, Nikolaou et al. [60],\nHorticulturae\
    \ 2019, 5, 7\n9 of 20\nworking with cucumber in rockwool, indicated a 9% lower\
    \ drainage amount between high and low\nirrigation frequency treatments (i.e.,\
    \ accumulated radiation outside greenhouse 1.3 MJ m−2 as opposed\nto 3 MJ m−2),\
    \ with no negative impact on production.\nDespite the fact that the frequency\
    \ of irrigation can be calculated based on the accumulated\nradiation method,\
    \ the threshold values of light energy requires frequent evaluation, as aﬀected\
    \ by\nchanges of crop coeﬃcient values and cultivation techniques (e.g., defoliation).\
    \ In any case, the solar\nradiation method was used only in soilless systems.\n\

    \ assessment is necessary to correctly quantify crop irrigation water\nneeds,\
    \ playing a crucial role in cooling greenhouse crop canopies [112]. In order to\

    reduced-size 20 cm diameter pan, eliminating the disadvantage of the large area\
    \ occupied by a class A\npan, (i.e., 121 cm diameter) [2,109,122]. Zeng et al.\
    \ [23] working in soil-based greenhouse cultivation,\nindicated that KCP values\
    \ of cucumber equal to one can be recommended for the most appropriate\nirrigation\
    \ scheduling from a standard 0.2 m diameter pan.\nCommercially available atmometers\
    \ can be used as an alternative approach to estimate\nevapotranspiration rate\
    \ [7].\nThe estimated evapotranspiration values using a Piche atmometer\n(evaporated\
    \ surface of paper disc), a modiﬁed atmometer (evaporated surface of a porous-porcelain\n\
    plate) and a reduced evaporation pan were compared with the Penman–Monteith evapotranspiration\n\
    method.\nAs results indicated, atmometers had the best performance for estimating\
    \ crop\nevapotranspiration in a greenhouse and could be used advantageously in\
    \ relation to the evaporation\npans [123].\nAccording to several authors, devices\
    \ that measure actual plant–soil evapotranspiration conﬁned\nwithin containers\
    \ (i.e., lysimeters) provide the only direct measure of water ﬂux from a vegetative\n\
    surface (i.e., can detect losses as small as 0.01 mm of water) and as such, they\
    \ provide a standard\nagainst which other methods can be tested and calibrated\

    \ while drainage lysimeters calculate ETC through water budgets,\nwhere excess\
    \ water removed by drainage or vacuum is subtracted from a known water volume\n\

    \ for the direct estimation\nof irrigation and drainage water amounts in soilless\

    \ the irrigation control system considers drainage amount as a single \nvariable,\
    \ it could not calculate the exact water amount used by the plant [69]. \nGreenhouse\

    \ planning [90,136,137]. Pérez-Castro et al. [138] indicated that the water\n\
    requirements within a greenhouse (i.e., evapotranspiration) can be calculated\
    \ based on virtual sensors\nby monitoring external greenhouse climatic conditions.\
    \ In line with this, virtual water sensors for\nsoilless greenhouse tomato based\
    \ on crop growth, substrate water and crop transpiration rate were\nalso used\

    \ appropriate rate.\nAgriculture in developed countries seems to be in a transition,\

    \ the agricultural ecosystems [141]. Additionally,\nvirtual plants have already\
    \ been used to develop a case study for the irrigation processes of a\ngreenhouse\

    \ in soil and soilless crop production in\ngreenhouses where irrigation scheduling\
    \ should match the diurnal course of evapotranspiration as\naﬀected by the prevailing\
    \ greenhouse environment through soil/substrate and crop characteristics.\nThe\
    \ majority of irrigation methods used in the past implement a feed forward or\
    \ a feedback irrigation\ndecision support system, and, in addition, water stress\
    \ indices were developed based on plant-sensing.\nHowever, a gap in commercialized\
    \ solutions exists despite the signiﬁcant research work in the ﬁeld of\nprecision\
    \ irrigation of greenhouse crops. It is important that a large margin of progress\
    \ in greenhouse\nwater and fertilizer use eﬃciency is managed by farmers [3].\
    \ The information presented reveals a need\nfor the development of a commercial\
    \ irrigation controller unit, in order to model and monitor the\nsoil-plant-atmosphere\

    content Abstract In-field sensor-based site-specific irrigation management is
    of benefit to producers for efficient water management. Integration of the decision
    making process with the controls is a viable option for determining when and where
    to irrigate, and how much water to apply. This research presents the design of
    decision support software and its integration with an in-field wireless sensor
    network (WSN) to implement site-specific sprinkler irrigation control via Bluetooth
    wireless communication. Wireless in-field sensing and control (WISC) software
    was designed by four major design factors that provide real-time monitoring and
    control of both inputs (field data) and outputs (sprinkler controls) by simple
    click-and-play menu using graphical user interface (GUI), and optimized to adapt
    changes of crop design, irrigation pattern, and field location. The WISC software
    provides remote access to in-field micrometeorological information from the distributed
    WSN and variable-rate irrigation control. An algorithm for nozzle sequencing was
    developed to stagger nozzle-on operations so as evenly distributed over the 60-s

    Introduction Efficient water management plays an important role in irrigated agricultural
    cropping systems. Many areas of agricultural fields are effectively over- or under-irrigated
    due to spatial variability in water infiltration and runoff of rainfall and irrigation,
    crop water use and irrigation depth. Under-irrigated areas are subject to water
    stress, resulting in production loss, while over-irrigated areas suffer from plant
    disease and nutrient leaching. A wireless sensor-based irrigation control system
    is a potential solution to optimize water management by remotely accessing in-field
    soil water conditions and site-specifically controlling irrigation sprinklers.
    The system requires seamless integration of the system input and output components,
    and software design for decision support and monitoring. Sensor-based irrigation
    systems have been studied for many applications (Stone et al., 1985, Jacobson
    et al., 1989, Zazueta and Smajstrla, 1992, Meron et al., 1995, Testezlaf et al.,
    1997). Stone et al. (1985) presented a computer-based monitoring system for continuous
    measurements of soil water potential. Zazueta and Smajstrla (1992) compared indirect
    estimates with direct measurement of soil moisture. Meron et al. (1995) used a
    control system for apple tree irrigation management using tensiometers. Testezlaf
    et al. (1997) used an automated irrigation control system for management of greenhouse
    container plants. A well-designed irrigation system is an essential requirement
    for a profitable and environmental friendly irrigation (Abreu and Pereira, 2002).
    Wireless radio frequency technology has provided opportunities to deploy wireless
    data communication in agricultural systems (Oksanen et al., 2004, Zhang, 2004,
    Lee et al., 2002). Software design for automated irrigation control has been studied
    by Abreu and Pereira (2002). They designed and simulated solid-set sprinkler irrigation
    systems by using ISADIM software that allowed to the design of a simplified layout
    of the irrigation system. However, their software provided limited control due
    to the lack of feedback in-field sensors. An automated irrigation system was proposed
    for remote in-field sensing and variable-rate irrigation control (Kim et al.,
    2008). The objective of this paper is to describe a user-friendly software design
    for decision support and monitoring of wireless sensor-based site-specific irrigation
    system. A schematic flowchart of an automated irrigation system for variable-rate
    irrigation is illustrated in Fig. 1. The system consists of machine conversion,
    localization, and mission planning. The first requirement is to convert a self-propelled
    irrigation machine from a conventional mechanical and hydraulic system to an electronically
    controllable system for individual sprinkler head control. Then, it is necessary
    to be able to continuously monitor the geographic location of the irrigation machine
    by a self-positioning system. Once the machine is controllable and accessible
    to its navigation, mission planning must decide when to irrigate and how much
    water each sprinkler head should apply at each location. This decision support
    process updates watering instructions according to the cart location and field
    soil water conditions monitored from sensors distributed across the field, and
    sends control signals to a nozzle controller at the irrigation machine. Download

    sprinkler irrigation system for variable-rate irrigation. 2. Wireless sensor network
    (WSN) A distributed WSN was developed for real-time in-field soil water content
    sensing (Kim et al., 2008). The network consisted of five sensing stations and
    a weather station. Each of the sensing stations contained a data logger (CR10,
    Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan, UT), two soil water reflectometers (CS616, Campbell
    Scientific Inc., Logan, UT) horizontally at the 30-cm and 61-cm soil depths each,
    and a soil temperature sensor (107, Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan, UT) at the
    15-cm soil depth. The weather station measured precipitation, air temperature,
    relative humidity, wind speed, wind direction, and solar radiation. Sensors at
    the in-field sensing and weather stations were scanned every 10 s, and data were
    stored and wirelessly transmitted every 15 min via a Bluetooth radio transmitter
    (SD202, Initium Co., Korea) back to a base computer at a receiver (MSP-102a, Initium
    Co., Korea). All components at each station are self-powered by a 12-V battery
    that is recharged by a solar panel (SX5, Solarex, Sacramento, CA). The design
    for power management and wireless communication for the WSN was detailed by Kim
    et al. (2008). The wireless sensor network was configured via transmission control
    protocol (TCP)/internet protocol (IP) to create a virtual serial network. The
    Bluetooth master at a base station operates as a TCP server, while other seven
    Bluetooth slaves are registered into TCP data ports. The server receives data
    from all seven in-field sensor clients and sends the data to the base computer
    via Ethernet. A serial emulator provides virtual COM ports and redirects to TCP
    socket connection (Fig. 2). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Virtual
    serial network. The receiver is configured as a multi-serial Bluetooth server
    and each Bluetooth device has virtual COM ports and redirected to TCP socket connection.
    2.1. Machine conversion A conventional irrigation machine needs conversion to
    adapt the in-field sensor-based variable-rate irrigation control. The machine
    used in the study was a ditch-feed, self-propelled linear-move irrigation system
    (Valmont Industries, Inc., Valley, NE) equipped with two different sprinkler application
    methods: mid-elevation spray application (MESA) and low energy precision application
    (LEPA) (Evans and Iversen, 2005). The irrigation system had six towers including
    the generator/pump/control cart located at the north end of the system. The machine
    moved at about 2 m/min at the 100% speed setting. The machine was converted to
    make sprinkler nozzles electronically and individually controllable by attaching
    a programmable logic controller (PLC), solenoids, air valves, GPS, and radio transmitter.
    The PLC (S7-226, Siemens, Johnson City, TN) was mounted on a main cart and activated
    electric solenoids (U8325B1V, ASCO, Florham Park, NJ) to control 30 banks (15
    for MESA banks and 15 for LEPA banks) of sprinklers via diaphragm valves (205,
    Bermad Inc., Anaheim, CA). The signal interface and software design for the PLC
    were detailed by Kim et al. (2008). The PLC updates the GPS position of the irrigation
    machine every second from a WAAS-enabled differential GPS (17HVS, Garmin, Olathe,
    KS) and wirelessly transmits the machine position to the base station via a Bluetooth
    radio transmitter. With feedback of in-field soil water conditions and the irrigation
    machine positions, the base station makes a real-time decision for site-specific
    irrigation and wirelessly sends individual sprinkler control signals to the PLC
    with a complete cycle of closed-loop control within a second via Bluetooth receiver.
    2.2. Cost of WSN The selection of the Bluetooth wireless system was based on communication
    range, data rate, and cost and intended to accommodate existing devices with plug-and-play
    type of wireless modules. The total cost of Bluetooth wireless modules used for
    in-field WSN was approximately $1200 for seven transmitters (five sensing, one
    weather, and one PLC control station) and one receiver (base station) as shown
    in Table 1. The cost of sensing and weather station depends on how many and which
    sensors are used at how many stations. A sensing station similar to what we used
    in this study costs approximately $800 for two soil moisture sensors, a soil temperature
    sensor, data logger, battery, and solar panel (Table 1). Table 1. System cost

    $1246 $2044 3. Software design factors There are many design choices to implement
    the closed-loop irrigation system. The design criterion of our software platform
    was how easy and efficiently end-users can use the software for comprehensive
    automation of their irrigation field. The growers want to see on the computer
    monitor at home the status of soil moisture at various locations including weather
    information and monitor irrigation operation by pulling up a map that sees how
    much water at where to apply or creating a new irrigation map by simple click-and-drag.
    During the irrigation, they may also want to see the current location of their
    irrigation machine, how far it went, and when it will reach the destination. If
    a rain shower passes over the field, they should be hoping the software to automatically
    adjust the amount of water being applied. To meet all grower''s concerns and requirements,
    user-friendly software was developed for real-time wireless in-field sensing and
    control (WISC). The software was Windows-based custom software and coded as a
    Win32 application using Microsoft Visual C++.Net (ver. 7.1). The WISC software
    was able to read the GPS data through the PLC and send control signals back to
    the PLC for individual sprinkler control after completing a decision making process.
    The algorithm flowchart of the WISC software is shown in Fig. 3. The software
    was updated from version 1.0 (Kim et al., 2006) to integrate the feedback of wireless
    sensor network into the decision making process. The decision support process
    is based on feedback of in-field data every 15 min and GPS updates of the location
    of the machine control cart every second. The actual amount of water applied to
    each plot is calculated based on the cycle ratios, recorded GPS-referenced times
    and locations during the irrigation operation and written to a file for reference.
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Algorithm flowchart of WISC Software
    for sensor-based site-specific irrigation stations that is updated every 15 min.
    The WISC software consists of four main design factors: control panel for hardware
    interface, graphical monitoring for in-field WSN, irrigation control and monitoring,
    and nozzle sequencing. Each design factor featured self-explanatory, click-and-play
    menu using graphical user interface (GUI) including an optional simulation function.
    The software was further optimized to adapt changes of crop design, irrigation
    pattern, and field location. 3.1. Control panel A control panel dialog was created
    to configure data interface for the irrigation control system. A GPS clock was
    corrected from Greenwich mean time (GMT) to a local time based on a time zone,
    and −6 was added to represent a U.S. Mountain time with daylight saving (Fig.
    4). The GPS offset was set to zero for both x- (east) and y- (north) axes, as
    the GPS was mounted on the middle of a main linear control cart with sprinkler
    nozzles aligned along a longitude line. The status of communication ports for
    the GPS and PLC are automatically detected on the software initiation, and corresponding
    serial port numbers are displayed (Fig. 4). A pushbutton ‘Irrigation Control’
    in Fig. 4 opens a real-time GPS-based irrigation control and monitoring dialog.
    During the irrigation operation, PLC communication connectivity is alerted every
    second after a complete cycle of data processing by a short beep sound, ranging
    from 0 (silent) to 10 (loudest). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Graphical
    display of in-field sensor data received from wireless sensor network. The 15-min
    update rate of the WSN data is based on a computer clock, while 60-s duty cycle
    of irrigation operation is based on a GPS clock. To avoid time mismatch between
    sensor feedback input and irrigation control output data in decision making, it
    is necessary to synchronize a computer clock with a GPS clock and convert to a
    correct local time by clicking a pushbutton of ‘Synch PC clock with GPS’ (Fig.
    4). All data are recorded during the irrigation operation and saved to a file
    named ‘PLC_mmdd.csv’, where ‘PLC’ is a default filename and ‘mm’ and ‘dd’ are
    the current month and day, respectively. Each data string contains actual amount
    of water applied on each plot with GPS data. 3.2. Remote monitoring of WSN A WSN
    dialog was added to provide a graphical display of the sensory data and to integrate
    in-field sensor feedback with an irrigation controller. There were five sensor
    stations numbered from 1 to 5 and a weather station numbered 6. Boxes under ‘Station
    ID’ on a WSN are checked as default to show all six stations and can be unchecked
    to see individual station data (Fig. 4). Time updates at each station are displayed
    next to the station list and used to check the status of radio communication and
    data transmissions. Weekly display of graphs was selected as default and can be
    changed to daily, monthly, or manual selection based on date or day of year (DOY),
    as shown in Fig. 4. 3.3. Real-time control of variable-rate irrigation (VRI) A
    GPS-based irrigation control dialog was created to provide interactive real-time
    control and monitoring of the site-specific irrigation operation. The dialog displays
    a background image of experimental plots and interactive control menu for wireless
    irrigation control. The image shows a base station in the research center on the
    left hand side and experimental plots 700 m away on the right hand side (Fig.
    5). The irrigation plot image can be zoomed by selecting the ‘IN’ or ‘OUT’ button
    on at the top of the plot image. An irrigation map is selected from the ‘OPEN’
    button and displayed over the plot image by clicking the ‘Irrigation Map’ button.
    Fig. 5 shows an example map of 30 sprinkler banks (15 for MESA in blue and 15
    for LEPA in green). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. GPS-based irrigation
    control dialog for real-time wireless irrigation control and monitoring, showing
    the sequence of nozzle-on operation at the bottom: without staggering (left, unstable
    below 50%), with staggering (right, stable all above 50%). The dialog allows selection
    of irrigation plots on crop menu buttons in ‘Crops’ at the top of the plot image.
    Plots to irrigate are selected based on crop types (sugar beet, barley, potato,
    wheat, etc.). Fig. 5 shows a total of 480 subplots (32 × 15) for variable-rate
    irrigation. Each subplot was color coded according to irrigation sprinkler types
    (light blue for MESA and light green for LEPA). User can define an irrigation
    type by clicking each subplot to toggle sprinkler types (MESA 100%, LEPA 100%,
    or 0% no water) and the amount of water application of each subplot from 0 to
    100% with 1% increment by click-and-dragging each slide bar in ‘Nozzle Duty Cycle
    [%]’ on the right hand side of Fig. 5, changing color intensity accordingly (more
    water in darker color). A modified irrigation map can be stored by selecting the
    ‘SAVE’ button to a map file with information of grid, crop locations, sprinkler
    type and percentage water amount on each subplots. The software receives GPS locations
    of the cart from the PLC and sends individual control signals for all sprinkler
    nozzle banks every second automatically on request after processing in-field sensory
    data for decision making. It also allows manual control by disabling ‘Auto Nozzle
    Control’ and selecting each span checkbox in ‘Real-Time Nozzle Control’ at the
    right top corner of Fig. 5. The ‘Toggle MESA/LEPA’ checkbox allows toggling MESA
    and LEPA when selecting either one, which prevents redundant irrigation on the
    same sprinkler banks. The decision rule base for variable-rate irrigation controls
    the amount of water applied by adjusting the duty cycle of each sprinkler bank
    in a period of 60 s. For instance, 50% water application turns the nozzle on for
    30 s and off for 30 s. When the irrigation cart moves across a plot boundary,
    irrigation data are recorded during the irrigation operation to a file containing
    each string name labeled with a local time stamp to the nearest millisecond, plot
    number, GMT time, longitude, latitude, and percentage of water actually applied
    on each plot row. The ‘Simulation’ button offers an option to simulate the variable-rate
    irrigation operation on a selected irrigation map with a slide bar of speed control.
    3.4. Nozzle sequencing for VRI The variable-rate irrigation is implemented by
    controlling nozzle on and off, and thus the sequence of nozzle operations must
    be carefully assigned to avoid system damage from high hydraulic pressure. Based
    on an assumption of 50% of total sprinkler banks as a minimum number of nozzle-on
    banks for safe hydraulic operation, the nozzle operation requires a staggering
    process to distribute the nozzle-on operations evenly during 60-s duty cycle.
    Two histogram at the bottom of Fig. 5 display the status of total nozzle-on operations
    by 15-horizontal timeslot bars whose length indicates nozzle-on watering duration
    out of 60-s full length (100% watering) in two different sprinkler types: MESA
    in blue and LEPA in green. The graph above each histogram illustrates the cumulative
    timeslot status of total nozzle-on banks. The left histogram shows operation without
    staggering in which all 15 sprinkler banks start the nozzle-on operation at the
    beginning of the 60-s cycle and result in an unsafe (upper graph in red line in
    Fig. 5) system after 24 s, because the total number of the nozzle-on banks becomes
    less than the 50% (7 banks) of the entire sprinkler banks (15 banks). The right
    histogram shows the staggered timeslots that were distributed to achieve the total
    number of nozzle-on banks above the 50% all the time across the 60-s cycle. An
    algorithm was developed to implement the staggering process with 15 timeslots
    for each of nozzle bank operations, as shown in Fig. 6. The goal of the staggering
    algorithm is to maintain the total number of nozzle-on banks more than a half
    of the entire sprinkler banks by rearranging nozzle-on timeslots (horizontal bars)
    within 60-s duty cycle. When a time (t) during the 60-s cycle is initialized to
    zero, the timeslots are sorted. Seven longest timeslots are searched and located
    to start at t = 0, while the rest of eight shortest timeslots are located to end
    at t = 60. If the total number of nozzle-on banks becomes less than 7, then an
    unused shortest timeslot is located to start at the time (t0) the previous timeslot
    ends until the total number is summed to 7. As time goes, the duration of the
    seven longest timeslots ends in the order of their timeslot length. On the right
    histogram in Fig. 5, for instance, the bank# 6 ends the nozzle-on duration at
    t = 24 in earliest among the seven longest timeslots (banks# 2, 6, 7, 10, 11,
    13, and 15), which causes the total number of nozzle-on banks to 6 (less than
    50%). In order to bring the number back to 7, the bank# 9 is selected as an unused
    shortest timeslot among the rest of eight shortest timeslots (banks# 1, 3, 4,
    5, 8, 9, 12, and 14) and placed to start at t = 24. This process repeats until
    the time reaches to the end of the cycle at t = 60 and restarts a staggering cycle.

    for variable-rate irrigation. 4. Software optimization Seasonal changes of irrigation
    patterns and different irrigation machines at different locations constrain the
    global use of the irrigation software. To overcome such constraint, this study
    was performed to optimize the irrigation software for the unconstrained use of
    variable-rate application via user-friendly graphical user interface. 4.1. Scalable
    plot design The plot layout (e.g. spacing) of individual irrigation plots can
    be varied over season and must be externally user-defined by irrigation software.
    The WISC software was optimized to adapt the changes of the field layout by making
    boundary lines of subplots adjustable so that each boundary line can be adjusted
    by click-and-drag and referring to a display of GPS location. Each boundary line
    can be landmarked for user reference, and its mark (inverted solid triangle in
    Fig. 5) is toggled on/off by clicking the top of the boundary line. All changes
    of grid and plot layout are included in each irrigation map, when it is saved
    to a map file. 4.2. Re-locatable field design The different irrigation fields
    at different locations changes the field size and irrigation pattern and must
    be adapted by irrigation software. The GPS location of the field is reconfigured
    by selecting the ‘SETUP’ button in Fig. 5, where the latitude and longitude of
    four boundary corners of the field are edited. The button also provides reconfiguration
    of field layout (e.g. size and numbers) of the irrigation plots, where the field
    grid is scalable up to 100 (column) × 50 (row) with maximum 5 sprinkler banks
    per span to adapt different irrigation. All real-world GPS coordinates are converted
    to image coordinates to fit in a screen size and register pixels to a real-world
    coordinates. According to the field geographical layout, the field orientation
    mark (4) is displayed on the left top corner of the irrigation map, and navigation
    information is displayed for distance and time traveled/to travel with a status
    arrow of heading direction at the bottom of the irrigation map in Fig. 5. 4.3.
    Reconfigurable crop design The crops are changed over the season, and the field
    needs to be reconfigured to define which crop is located at where. The ‘DEFINE
    CROP’ button on the top of the irrigation map in Fig. 5 allows a user to redefine
    the type of crop and reassign each individual subplot to a different crop by selecting
    a crop and clicking each subplot to include/exclude, which toggles red-boxed/no-boxed,
    respectively. Once crops are all defined, selecting a crop will include in irrigation
    operation only subplots assigned in the define mode to the crop. 5. Experiment
    and results The WISC software was tested for in-field wireless sensor-based closed-loop
    irrigation control during the 2007 growing season under a linear-move irrigation
    system on a field planted to malting-barley at the Eastern Agricultural Research
    Center of Montana State University in Sidney, MT. Five in-field sensing stations
    were installed at five different soil zones labeled in descending order of soil
    electrical conductivity, while an in-field weather station was mounted on the
    linear irrigation cart. The manually selected travel speed of the linear-move
    sprinkler system determines the maximum application depth. The amount of water
    applied was determined by the deficit of the current soil moisture status from
    the upper limit value of the range of each sensor to apply a percentage of maximum.
    Sensor calibration and decision making process are detailed in Kim et al. (2009).
    The amount of water to apply at each of VRI plots is updated every 15 min by in-field
    soil water feedback from all five soil zones. The soil water status at each sensor
    station represents all rest of area that belongs to the same soil zone and is
    distributed across the VRI plots. Catch cans were installed across a strip that
    contained all five soil zones and aligned between two MESA sprinkler heads (Fig.
    7). The cans catch water only from MESA nozzles, since LEPA nozzles drop water
    below catch cans’ height. Fig. 8 shows catch can data collected on August 16,
    2007 and compared to irrigation amount that was determined by decision making
    process, ranging 0.1–2.5 cm water over the five soil zones. They were correlated
    to the irrigated amount with r2 = 0.98 with average 0.08 cm of more catch can
    water under the wind drift of average 10 km/h at 18° wind direction. Download

    irrigation system requires a seamless integration of in-field wireless sensor
    network and closed-loop control of sprinkler nozzles and must be easily used and
    simply managed by end-users (growers) via user-friendly software. A real-time
    wireless in-field sensing and control software was developed to integrate a site-specific
    irrigation controller with in-field data feedback and support the decision making
    and real-time monitoring of irrigation operations via Bluetooth wireless radio
    communication. This paper provided to readers details of software design choices
    with design factors and optimizations for unconstrained global use. Each design
    factor featured self-explanatory, click-and-play menu using graphical user interface
    including an optional simulation function. An algorithm for nozzle sequencing
    was developed to minimize hydraulic pressure surges by staggering and uniformly
    distributing the nozzle-on timeslots during 60-s duty cycle. The system successfully
    enabled real-time remote access to the field conditions and feedback control for
    site-specific irrigation with high correlation of r2 = 0.98 to water collected
    by catch cans. The benefit of software design extends to adapt automated site-specific
    fertilizer or chemical applications. References Abreu and Pereira, 2002 Abreu,

    The proper management of irrigation systems is a key factor to achieve an efficient
    use of water and an adequate crop production. The use of new automatic control
    and communication technologies, offers a set of tools for data gathering and analysis,
    and assists agronomists and farmers to take better decisions in order to develop
    a sustainable agriculture, able to maintain its productivity and to be useful
    to the society in the long term. This work presents the implementation and set-up
    of a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system designed to supervise
    and control a drip irrigation system. The irrigation system is installed in a
    young olive orchard, located in San Juan, an arid region fully dependent on irrigation.
    The main task of the system is to gather and display the information coming from
    the field devices (soil moisture sensors, weather station, water flow-meters and
    programmable-logic-controller (PLC) for commanding the irrigation system) and
    automatically control the irrigation. The main screen of the SCADA software presents
    current information related to the process and, in other tabs, gives a detailed
    report of data. The gathered information is saved to a data base that can be accessed
    by different users, allowing the participation of other users, such as irrigation
    advisers, laboratories, quality control, maintenance, etc. Information can be
    accessed locally, through internet or by other means. Results of this experience
    show that it is possible to apply new technological tools to manage the irrigation
    process as a way to improve its efficiency. Article - full text (enhanced PDF

    \ that half of the ﬁeld trials are not relevant because of climatic conditions\
    \ that do\nnot allow the stress scenario to be tested. The PhénoField\nR⃝ platform\
    \ is the ﬁrst ﬁeld\nbased infrastructure in the European Union to ensure protection\

    R⃝ production capability using data from 2017-\nwheat trial. The innovative approach\
    \ of the PhénoField\nR⃝ platform consists in the use of\nautomatic irrigating\
    \ rainout shelters coupled with high throughput ﬁeld phenotyping to\ncomplete\
    \ conventional phenotyping and micrometeorological densiﬁed measurements.\nFirstly,\
    \ to test various abiotic stresses, automatic mobile rainout shelters allow ﬁne\n\
    management of fertilization or irrigation by driving daily the intensity and period\
    \ of the\napplication of the desired limiting factor on the evaluated crop. This\
    \ management is\nbased on micro-meteorological measurements coupled with a simulation\
    \ of a carbon,\nwater and nitrogen crop budget. Furthermore, as high-throughput\
    \ plant-phenotyping\nunder controlled conditions is well advanced, comparable\
    \ evaluation in ﬁeld conditions\nis enabled through phenotyping gantries equipped\
    \ with various optical sensors. This\napproach, giving access to either similar\
    \ or innovative variables compared manual\nmeasurements, is moreover distinguished\
    \ by its capacity for dynamic analysis. Thus,\nthe interactions between genotypes\
    \ and the environment can be deciphered and better\ndetailed since this gives\
    \ access not only to the environmental data but also to plant\nresponses to limiting\
    \ hydric and nitrogen conditions. Further data analyses provide\naccess to the\
    \ curve parameters of various indicator kinetics, all the more integrative\nand\
    \ relevant of plant behavior under stressful conditions. All these speciﬁcities\

    \ HTP Platform\nINTRODUCTION\nThe last three decades have witnessed a decline\
    \ in the growth\nof yield trends (AGRESTE, 2018) which has been attributed to\n\
    climate change rather than to breeding or agronomical causes\n(Brisson et al.,\
    \ 2010). Climate changes are in general unfavorable\nto cereal yields in temperate\
    \ climates because of higher heat stress\nduring grain ﬁlling and longer drought\
    \ during stem elongation.\nRegional model simulations for climate change in mid-Europe\n\
    agree on an occurrence of higher variability in rainfall in the\ncoming decades,\
    \ with an increased risk of water shortage during\nsummers (Jacob et al., 2013).\
    \ At the same time, water resources\navailable for agricultural irrigation will\
    \ be reduced or maintained\nin the best scenarios (Barros et al., 2014). Moreover,\
    \ the crucial\nrole of nitrogen on production and quality of the harvested\norgans\
    \ (Jensen et al., 2011) coupled with the potential impact of\nnitrogen losses\
    \ on the environment (Galloway et al., 2003; Sutton\net al., 2011) lead to an\
    \ increasing concern about the improvement\nof the nitrogen use eﬃciency of the\
    \ agricultural systems. This\nperspective enforces the need to design strategies\
    \ and tools that\ncombine novel crop genotypes and adapted crop management\ntechniques\
    \ to assist agriculture in facing major challenges, such\nas increasing rainfall\
    \ variability and the reduced availability of\nfertilizers (Wreford et al., 2010).\n\
    While genomic capacity encountered a breakthrough in\n2010, phenotyping capacity\
    \ has become the major limitation in\nbreeding programs aimed at building genotypes\
    \ that maintain\nor increase crop performance under climate changes and\nreduced\
    \ inputs (Furbank and Tester, 2011). In ﬁeld conditions,\nconventional phenotyping\
    \ represents high investment, it is\nlaborious, mainly destructive, and could\
    \ weaken signiﬁcance or\nprecision of results from consolidated large experimental\
    \ reliant\nnetworks. Numerous measurements on a broad genetic diversity\npanel\
    \ are now perceived as key levers of genetic advances and\nlessen the potential\
    \ added value of modern techniques such as\nmarker-assisted selection, or genomic\
    \ selection (Araus et al.,\n2018). To address this issue, signiﬁcant eﬀorts have\
    \ been made to\nencourage the capacities of multilevel phenotyping in worldwide\n\
    initiatives and dynamics, creating networks and communities.\nThe acceleration\
    \ of instrumentation (Reynolds et al., 2018;\nRoitsch et al., 2019) and sampling\
    \ capacities (Pieruschka and\nSchurr, 2019) has opened the way for further investigation\
    \ in\nepigenetic mechanisms and plant physiology with the possibility\nof building\
    \ advanced digital models of plant physiology which\nunderpin research and decision\
    \ support services (Jiang et al.,\n2018; Tardieu et al., 2018; van Eeuwijk et\
    \ al., 2018).\nThe French Plant Phenotyping Network1, PHENOME-\nEMPHASIS/France,\
    \ funded by the French National Research\nAgency (ANR), and lead by the National\
    \ Institute of Agricultural\nResearch (INRA), provides French researchers with\
    \ up-to-\ndate, high throughput infrastructures and methods allowing the\ncharacterization\
    \ of diﬀerent species under scenarios associated\nwith climate change. The project\
    \ aims (i) to build and upgrade\nhighly instrumented platforms in nine French\
    \ sites able as a\nwhole to grow the most common crop species under a large\n\
    1https://www.phenome-emphasis.fr/\nrange of environmental conditions, (ii) to\
    \ develop new sensing\ntechnologies, associated with advanced data processing\
    \ and\nmanagement, (iii) to disseminate the newly developed techniques\nand methods\
    \ within the French phenotyping community\n(breeders, technical institutes, and\
    \ public research groups) and\n(iv) to enhance the emergence of French SMEs involved\
    \ in\ndeveloping phenotyping methods.\nThe PhénoField\nR⃝ platform is management\
    \ by the applied\nresearch institute ARVALIS and is part of the PHENOME-\nEMPHASIS/France\
    \ project. It is an original ﬁeld phenotyping\nplatform enabling the design of\
    \ a large range of drought\nand nutrient availability scenarios and the ﬁne characterization\n\
    of crop functioning as a response to these abiotic stresses.\nThis accurate monitoring\
    \ of both growing conditions and\ncrop growth in the ﬁeld is a key to improving\
    \ the analysis\nof genetics × environment interactions and to identifying\ngenotypic\
    \ markers associated with favorable crop behavior. To\nthis end, the PhénoField\n\
    R⃝ platform manages a moving rainout\nshelter and irrigation systems that allow\
    \ the application of\ndiﬀerent ﬁeld drought conditions (since 2015), all the while\n\
    coupled with environmental sensors to control drought stress\nenvironments. PhénoField\n\
    R⃝ uses high-throughput phenotyping\ntechnologies set (validated and innovative\
    \ sensors) on an\nautomated gantry (since 2017), allowing frequent and non-\n\
    invasive high-resolution measurements of the canopy. Its\nlocation at Ouzouer-le-Marché/Beauce\
    \ la Romaine (41), central\nFrance, makes PhénoField\nR⃝ representative of irrigated\
    \ crop farms\nof the Beauce area with the capability of studying large genotype\n\
    panels of various species (bread wheat, durum wheat, corn, etc.).\n2017 was the\
    \ 1st year oﬀering advanced capability on\nPhénoField\nR⃝. During this crop season,\
    \ PhénoField\nR⃝ carried\nout a bread wheat ﬁeld trial in the framework of the\n\
    BREEDWHEAT project2, the purposes of which are to strengthen\nthe competitiveness\
    \ of the French wheat breeding sector and\naddress the societal demand for sustainability,\
    \ quality, and safety\nin agricultural production. The BREEDWHEAT project aims\
    \ to\ndevelop new breeding methodologies and use unexploited genetic\nresources\
    \ to identify and combine alleles of interest into new\necological friendly varieties\
    \ adapted to climate changes, including\nthe enhanced adaptation to increasing\
    \ biotic and abiotic stresses.\nThe trial hosted in 2017 in the PhénoField\nR⃝\
    \ platform as a node\nof a trial network, focused on water and nitrogen stresses\
    \ and\ntheir interaction with genotypes. Indeed, one of the key drivers\nof yield\
    \ gap mitigation and reduction is reducing the reliance\non nitrogen fertilizers\
    \ (Hawkesford, 2014) or a better Nitrogen\nUse Eﬃciency (NUE) and Water Use Eﬃciency\
    \ (WUE) through\nimproved understanding of respective and crossed mechanisms\n\
    driving these parameters in plain ﬁeld conditions (Fischer and\nConnor, 2018).\

    \ the last three decades of genetic\ninnovation, under nitrogen and water deﬁcit.\

    \ to this, a set of tools and procedures have been\nassessed to ﬁnely monitor\

    \ system is\ndescribed. It includes automated sensing tools and the related\n\
    data processing methods.\nAs an example here, results obtained during the 2017\n\
    BREEDWHEAT experiment have been analyzed to answer\ntwo questions: Is the platform\
    \ able to generate the desired\nabiotic-stress scenarios? How is the phenotyping\
    \ system able\nto reveal diﬀerentiated bread wheat behaviors amongst water\ndeﬁcit\
    \ conditions, nitrogen deﬁcit conditions or a studied\ngenotypic panel?\nMATERIALS\
    \ AND METHODS\nDEVELOPED ON THE PHÉNOFIELD\nR⃝\nPLATFORM\nThe\nPhénoField\nR⃝\n\
    platform\nis\nlocated\nat\nOuzouer-le-\nMarché/Beauce la Romaine (41) in Beauce\
    \ region, one of\nFrance’s most productive agricultural areas hosting a wide variety\n\
    of cultivated crops (Figure 1). It was implemented in 2013\non 7.5 hectares of\
    \ farmland and is equipped with 8 moving\nrainout shelters, environmental sensors\
    \ and high throughput\nphenotyping facilities. A web-based user interface, named\
    \ PhenX\n(Piquemal, 2017), allows data visualization and downloading.\nManaged\
    \ Environment\nMobile Rainout Shelters\nEach rainout shelter covers 655 m2 (about\
    \ 25 m × 25 m), and\nis equipped with an automaton controlling its movement. The\n\
    central controller is linked to a rain contact sensor and sonic\nanemometer to,\
    \ respectively, trigger the movement of the rainout\nshelters and secure the infrastructure\
    \ (in case of strong wind).\nEach of the 8 rainout shelters is seated on three\
    \ 150 m-long\nrails in order to move them from a garage position (when it\ndoes\
    \ not rain Figure 2A) to a rain controlled position (when\nraining Figure 2B).\
    \ The rainout shelters are arranged along 4\ncropping areas to ensure adequate\
    \ crop rotation every year with,\ngenerally, 2 cropping areas with the trial crop\
    \ (Nos. 3 and 4,\nFigure 2) and the 2 others with an “erasure crop” (Nos. 1 and\
    \ 2,\nFigure 2) including one area for park position. This experimental\ndesign\
    \ allows ﬁrstly, the rainout shelter to be stationed at 43 m\nfurther than the\
    \ trial area, thus avoiding the drop shadow during\nnon-rainy periods and secondly,\
    \ the rain- controlled position to\noperate in the same area every 4 years. To\
    \ maintain this eﬃcient\ncrop rotation, the erasure crop must be chosen according\
    \ to the\nspecies studied. Field trial species on PhénoField\nR⃝ are therefore\n\
    discussed nearly 18 months before trial implementation.\nThe 8 rainout shelters\
    \ protect 384 m × 6 m ﬁeld trial\nmicroplots (1 m × 6 m; Figure 1-rigth part).\
    \ Each shelter, formed\nby 2 spans, manages 48 microplots with experimental modalities\n\
    applied per group of 24 microplots at span scale. For crop\nmanagement, PhénoField\n\
    R⃝ is equipped with a special spray boom\nto treat one span from the central aisle\
    \ between rainout shelters\nand so avoid aﬀecting soil compaction with machinery\
    \ under\nrainout shelters. Thus, nitrogen or crop protection cross-factors\nare\
    \ set up at span scale.\nThe eight rainout shelters are equipped with their own\n\
    individual irrigation networks, allowing precise management\nof the water supply\
    \ in protected plots. Two booms per\nrainout shelter allow up to 16 diﬀerent irrigation\
    \ modalities.\nHence PhénoField\nR⃝ can perform between 1 controlled irrigation\n\
    modality on 384 microplots to up to 16 modalities of 24\nmicroplots. Using the\
    \ rainfall area (when rainout shelter parking\nis on area no. 1 or no. 4), PhénoField\n\
    R⃝ allows a 768-\nmicroplot ﬁeld trial. Roof gutters collect the rain water used\

    \ This whole infrastructure allows crops to be subjected\nto a pre-determined\
    \ duration of water stress at any desired\nperiod of their cycle.\nSoil Characterization\n\
    The management of crop water stress implies precise soil\ncharacterization\nestablished\n\
    with\nmeasurements\nof\nsoil\nresistivity and water holding capacity (WHC) on\
    \ the entire\nPhénoField\nR⃝ platform.\nThe electrical resistivity of the soil\
    \ is a physical quantity related\nto the soil’s intrinsic characteristics (clay\
    \ content, texture, water\ncontent, depth, etc.), with the higher values representing\
    \ soil\nresistance to current ﬂow. This magnitude of soil resistivity is\nmeasurable\
    \ at high resolution and allows, for some types of soil,\nto extrapolate geographically\
    \ located measures of water holding\ncapacity (Michot et al., 2003). Soil resistivity\
    \ measurements were\nperformed by using the Automatic Resistivity Proﬁling (ARP)\n\
    method which uses a multi-electrode system towed by a quad bike\nfor rapid data\
    \ acquisition (Dabas, 2008). One pair of electrodes\nwas used for electric current\
    \ injection and 3 pairs were employed\nfor measurements in order to investigate\
    \ the soil resistivity\nbetween 0–50, 0–100, and 0–200 cm. ARP measurements were\n\
    performed in September 2011 over the entire farmland to acquire\nsoil-resistivity\
    \ data used to get a global view of the agricultural\nplot and optimize rainout\
    \ shelter locations on the farmland.\nThe soil observed on the agricultural ﬁeld\
    \ is Beauce clay loam\nwith a loamy clay texture on calcareous Beauce rock. Samples\n\
    have been taken to determine the WHC/cm of the diﬀerent types\nof soil layers\
    \ based on granulometric analyses. Spatialization\nof soil layer thicknesses was\
    \ performed at the beginning of\nplatform construction by using the 1,100 pits\
    \ opened for pouring\nconcrete pads, from 0 to 1.5 m for each pit. In more detail,\
    \ we\nmeasured four kinds of soil thicknesses: LA which corresponds\nto plowed\
    \ horizon, S which is cambic horizon, C1 and C2 which\ncorrespond to calcaric\
    \ material (C1 is cryoturbed limestone and\nC2 is sandy calcaric material). Based\
    \ on these data combined\nwith pF data for each horizons characterized, soil mapping\
    \ was\ngenerated with krigeage models providing soil layer thicknesses\nbut also\
    \ WHC estimation at every point of the platform. As\nmicroplots are georeferenced,\
    \ an estimation of the WHC was\nperformed for each of them by computing the mean\
    \ of the WHC\npoints contained in the corresponding area. Data management\nwas\
    \ operated by PostgreSQL software, a relational database\nmanagement system extended\
    \ with PostGIS software to add\nsupport for geographic objects.\nPhénoField\n\
    R⃝ Rainout Shelter Efﬁciency\nCharacterization\nEvaluation of the shelters’ capacity\
    \ to eﬃciently intercept rainfall\nwas evaluated in 2017 by measuring precipitation\
    \ along transects\nof crops protected by the shelters. Seven pluviometers were\n\
    installed at equivalent distances (6 m) with ﬁve installed under\nthe area protected\
    \ by rainout shelters and two others installed\non each side of this protected\
    \ area. Pluviometers were positioned\nbetween each microplot-line.\nPossible side\
    \ eﬀects on photosynthetically active radiation\n(PAR) and temperature were also\
    \ assessed in 2017 by using,\nrespectively, two quantum sensors (SKP215, Campbell\
    \ Scientiﬁc)\nand two thermocouples (T109, Campbell Scientiﬁc). One of each\n\
    sensor was set up in the center of the area protected from rain\nand the other\
    \ one outside the protected area. Comparisons of\nair temperature and PAR inside\
    \ and outside the shelter-protected\narea were performed by measuring the cumulative\
    \ PAR and\ndegree-day over the period of crop protection. The cumulative\ndaily\
    \ light was calculated as the sum of PAR received each day\nby the crop (in µmol.m−2)\
    \ and the cumulative degree-day as the\nmean of maximum and minimum daily temperatures\
    \ added up\nover the day with the 0 value corresponding to the 1st day of\nrain\

    speed and direction in 15-min steps. The soil humidity and soil\nwater tension\
    \ at 30, 60, and 90 cm deep are recorded in control\nplots under each rainout\
    \ shelter.\nIrrigation management was realized using Irrinov\nR⃝ method\n(Bouthier\
    \ et al., 2003). Irrinov\nR⃝ is an online free irrigation\ntool based on tensiometer\
    \ measurements3. It gives tension\nthresholds above which farmers have to irrigate\
    \ for Watermark\nR⃝\ntensiometers at 30 and 60 cm deep in a given situation (3\n\
    tensiometers are placed at each depth). This method has been\ndeveloped by Arvalis\
    \ and its partners for diﬀerent regions in\nFrance. Thresholds depend on four\
    \ main variables: climatic\ndemand, soil type, crop and period between two irrigations\n\
    (parameter which depends on farmer irrigation equipment). It\nis made for farmers\
    \ to manage irrigation in its tactic phase.\nThresholds were determined with ﬁeld\
    \ trials in diﬀerent French\nregions. For PhénoField\nR⃝, we chose Irrinov\nR⃝\
    \ method adapted to\nFrench region Centre, for a deep soil and for wheat. In these\n\
    conditions, 30 cm-tensiometer threshold is 100 cbar and 60 cm\nthreshold is 80\
    \ cbar before last leaf spread growth stage (Z39)\nand 100 cbar after. To manage\
    \ well-watered irrigation during the\nBREEDWHEAT trial, we decreased thresholds\
    \ to bring water in\nthe ﬁeld to 80 cbar also after Z39 to be sure plants do not\
    \ suﬀer\nfrom water stress in well-watered conditions (WW). This method\nallowed\
    \ us to consider that under 120 cbar threshold at 60 cm\nwheat is not suﬀering\
    \ from water stress. Unfortunately, this kind\nof probe cannot record signal higher\
    \ than 200 cbar and they don’t\nmeasure soil humidity directly.\nIt was therefore\
    \ necessary to have other kind of sensors to\nmeasure soil humidity. To do that,\
    \ soil humidity was measured\nwith Time Domain Reﬂectometry probes (TDR-TRIME-PICO\n\
    64) installed at 30, 60, and 90 cm deep in control plots under\neach shelter.\
    \ This type of probe has the advantage of being\nburied for 5–10 years without\
    \ being moved. To position them\ndeep in the soil it was necessary to make small\
    \ trenches and\nTDR probes are known to be very sensitive to their immediate\n\
    environment (air, ground contact with the pins, pebbles, etc.) so\nthey must have\
    \ been calibrated with a series of ﬁve gravimetric\nmeasurements performed every\
    \ 2 months. Gravimetric water\ncontent was determined by measuring the weight\
    \ of freshly\ncollected soil (near each probe) and a soil sample oven-dried at\n\
    110◦C over 48 h (see Supplementary Figure S1).\nIn addition to measurements by\
    \ the probes on control plots,\nsoil nitrogen content was measured following a\
    \ colorimetric\nmethod using a KCL extraction on samples taken before sowing,\n\
    at the end of winter and after harvesting.\nCHN: A Model to Quantify Abiotic Limiting\
    \ Factors\nAgro-meteorological conditions are incorporated into a dynamic\ncrop\
    \ model (called ‘CHN’) used to estimate crop growth,\nmanage crop practices and\
    \ evaluate crop responses to water and\nnitrogen shortage (Soenen et al., 2016).\
    \ This model calculates\nthe daily ﬂow of carbon (C), water (H), and nitrogen\
    \ (N)\nbetween the soil, atmosphere and plant compartments at a\ndaily time stage\
    \ during a cropping season (see Supplementary\n3http://www.irrinov.arvalisinstitutduvegetal.fr/irrinov.asp\n\
    Figure S2). Soil and Atmosphere compartments are connected\nto databases using,\
    \ respectively, diﬀerent soil characteristics in\nFrance and daily weather data\
    \ (over 250 sites with 25 years data;\nSoenen et al., 2016). The plant compartment\
    \ is based on the\nMonteith approach (Monteith, 1994): leaf growth is modeled\n\
    and intercepts radiation that is converted into biomass. The\nGreen Plant Area\
    \ Index (GPAI), transpiration and biomass are\naﬀected by water and nitrogen deﬁciency,\
    \ according to functions\nof stress response developed by Sinclair (Sinclair,\
    \ 1986). These\nfunctions provide a stress factor between 1 (minimum stress)\n\
    and 0 (maximum stress), that is used to slow down the potential\ngrowth and transpiration.\
    \ Links between soil–plant–atmosphere\ncompartments are the background of a model\
    \ of the water and\nnitrogen balance. Coupled with frequentist weather forecasts,\n\
    CHN outputs are complementary to probe measurements for\nwater and nitrogen input\
    \ management to follow-up the situation\nof each shelter line each day.\nTrial\
    \ From the BREEDWHEAT Project\nIn 2016–2017, a bread winter wheat ﬁeld trial was\
    \ conducted\nfor the BREEDWHEAT project. It aimed to evaluate 22\nvarieties, mutual\
    \ to other ﬁeld experiments and known for their\ndiversity of responses to diﬀerent\
    \ stresses, especially diﬀering\nin behavior to nitrogen- and water-stressed conditions.\
    \ Using\nsix of the eight rainout shelters from PhénoField\nR⃝, it was\nimplemented\
    \ with a double split-plot design in order to group\nwater management treatments\
    \ under rainout shelters and two\nnitrogen fertilization levels per rainout shelter\
    \ (one per span) (see\nSupplementary Table S1).\nThe two water management treatments\
    \ consisted of:\n1. Well Water conditions (called “WW”) without rain\ninterception\

    \ frequent\ncrop canopy measurements via remote sensors, thus ensuring\nnon-invasive\
    \ measurements and the collection of a large amount\nof phenotyping data. Each\
    \ 25 m wide gantry is able to lift\na payload at a 6 m height, allowing data acquisition\
    \ on any\ntype of crop, even tall maize cultivars. These data are obtained\nwith\
    \ the sensors installed on a high throughput phenotyping\nbay, mounted on the\
    \ gantries during experimental campaigns. It\nallows smoothed screening from 0.1\
    \ to 3 m.s−1 and centimetric\ncontrolled repositioning of canopy sizing from 0\
    \ to 3 m. Each\nsensor head can carry a set of sensors with no limit of power\n\
    consumption and up to 150 kg. New sensor installation is possible\nthanks to its\
    \ payload capacity and its agile interfacing. An open\nrobotic operating system\
    \ (ROS; Quigley et al., 2009) was used\nto allow interfacing of several sensors\
    \ and the management of\nspatial and temporal sampling on each microplot.\nTwo\

    \ types of optical sensors. The position\nof the sensors was optimized in order\
    \ to spatially sample the\narea of interest and allow intra-plot borders removal.\
    \ Each\nsensor bay had 2 measuring viewpoints: an optical head at the\nvertical\

    \ performed systematically\nagainst a secondary calibration surface and tracked\
    \ by the\nNational Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) through\nSpectralon\n\
    R⃝ (Labsphere, NH, United States) in accordance with\ngood practice for uncertainty\
    \ management (GUM). This data\nwere used to correct the white balance of RGB cameras\
    \ and to\ncalculate physical units of reﬂectance. Acquisition was optimized\n\
    to maximize the sampling within the microplot and to allow\nfull acquisition of\
    \ the platform in 1 day with a two-sensors bay.\nDuring the 2017 campaign an operation\
    \ speed of 0.3 m.s−1\nwas chosen allowing three acquisitions of each RGB image\
    \ and\nof VIS-NIR reﬂectance measurements. LiDAR acquisition was\ncarried out\
    \ all over the plot area.\nProcessing and Interpretation\nFor RGB cameras, a white\
    \ balance process was ﬁrst applied to\nadjust intensities of the red, green, and\
    \ blue channels at a same\nintensity on a reference gray panel. This standardization\
    \ was\nimportant for a robust color based image analysis.\nThe ﬁrst use a RGB\
    \ images was the calculation of the green\ncover fractions (GCF) at 0◦ and 45◦.\
    \ A support vector machine\nalgorithm trained on a reference dataset, was used\
    \ to classify\nfor each image the green and non-green pixels and determine\nthe\
    \ percentage of green elements for a given viewing angle\n(Dutartre et al., 2015).\n\
    The green cover fractions at 0◦ and 45◦ were used to estimate\nthe Green Area\
    \ Index (GAI) and Average Leaf Angle (ALA). Both\nvariables were estimated by\
    \ inverting a simple Poisson model\nusing the measured gap fractions Po, calculated\
    \ as (1-GCF). The\nmodel used to relate Po to GAI is:\nPo\n\0θp\n\x01\n= e\n−\
    \ G(θp,θl)\ncos(θp) . GAI\nWhere θp is the viewing angle, θl is the mean leaf\
    \ angle and\nG(θp,θl) is the function that expresses the projected area of the\n\
    leaves for a particular conﬁguration. We assumed that the G\nfunction follows\
    \ an ellipsoidal leaf angle distribution (Campbell,\n1986, 1990). The model was\
    \ inverted using a look up table\nminimization procedure (Weiss et al., 2000,\
    \ 2004) to retrieve the\nmore likely combination of GAI and ALA.\nFor spectroradiometers,\
    \ a calibration measurement on a\nspectrally characterized reference surface was\
    \ done before each\ndata acquisition session. The reﬂectance at the crop level\n\
    was then obtained by dividing the canopy reﬂectance by the\ncalibration measurement.\

    \ vegetation indexes\nfrom remote sensing literature were selected for their asserted\n\
    link with diﬀerent phenological aspects of the aerial part of\nmonitored crop.\
    \ The vegetation indices calculations were made\nwith a 3 nm Full Width Half Maximum\

    proposed by Rouse et al., 1974) is a basic and robust indicator\nof the amount\

    \ green fraction, the maximum level\nwas almost the same during the growing period,\
    \ but the fall\nof green fraction began earlier on WD N+ (middle of May)\nthan\
    \ on WW N+ (middle of June) (Figure 12B). This could\nexplain poor grain ﬁlling\

    \ relationship between this trait and the\nquantity of nitrogen in the grain.\n\
    Looking at parameters of curves such as the maximum value,\nFigure 14 shows a\

    \ this small rainfall entry and fully\nprotected the ﬁeld trial.\nDuring the raining\
    \ period, crop protection by shelters\ninduced a PAR decrease and an overall air\
    \ temperature\nincrease (Supplementary Figure S3). Such secondary eﬀects were\n\
    generally reported as being due to the use of shelters with values\nclose to those\
    \ reported by Paajanen et al. (2011) who noticed\na 44% reduction in the PAR due\
    \ to shelters. In this way, the\nautomatic control of shelters limited these side\
    \ eﬀects by reducing\nthe time of protection. The result acquired in 2017 was\
    \ that\nthe cumulative PAR decreased by 3.5% and the temperature\nincreased by\
    \ 1.8%. These results inspire us to continue measuring\nhow shelters impact the\
    \ environment over time and to use\ntheir automatic movement in order to reduce\
    \ protection time.\nMoreover, these eﬀects seem to be very low on wheat growth\n\
    but the expected impact on other crops must be simulated using\nthe check plots.\
    \ That is why we should use the CHN model to\nsimulate what could be the impact\
    \ on other crops.\nMapping soil characterization is important to understand soil\n\
    heterogeneity in order to take it into account in the interpretation\nof agronomic\
    \ variables (Di Virgilio et al., 2007). The WHC map\nshowed signiﬁcant variability\
    \ typical of the soil of this region.\nIndeed, the clay-silt soils developed on\
    \ Beauce limestone have a\nvariability of thickness within very short distances\
    \ (sometimes\nmetric, Seger et al., 2017). It is important to consider this\n\
    variability during crop management because crops growing on\nlimited WHC are more\
    \ subject to drought and will probably\nrequire more irrigation. The simultaneous\
    \ use of the WHC\nmap, the CHN model, tensiometers and TDR probes allows\nmonitoring\
    \ and control of limiting factors applied to the crops.\nHowever, work should\
    \ be carried out to characterize root depth\nin order to reﬁne the map of the\
    \ WHC, and so deﬁne a map of\nthe water accessible to the plant. The ultimate\
    \ goal is to access to\nmicroplot scale data to characterize crop water consumption\
    \ for\neach microplot tested on PhénoField\nR⃝.\nHigh Throughput Phenotyping to\n\
    Characterize Drought and Nitrogen\nStress Impact\nPhénoField\nR⃝ uses high throughput\
    \ ﬁeld based phenotyping\ndevelopment to characterize responses of crop to abiotic\
    \ stresses.\nThe example of the BREEDWHEAT ﬁeld trial conducted in 2017\ndemonstrated\
    \ the capacity of the system to characterize drought\nand nitrogen stress impact\
    \ on wheat growth, with accuracy\nneeded to diﬀerentiate treatments like wheat\
    \ varieties.\nIn this trial, water and nitrogen deﬁciency have diﬀerent\nimpact\
    \ on agronomical traits but we have a signiﬁcant\ndiﬀerence\nbetween\nvarieties\n\
    on\nall\nagronomical\ntraits\n(Supplementary Table S2).\nIn our case, the application\
    \ of drought during the stem\nelongation period (Figure 8) negatively aﬀected\
    \ the yield of the\nwheat (Figure 10). Drought continued to severely aﬀect yield\n\
    during grain-ﬁlling, inducing earlier green fraction decreasing\nthat could be\
    \ considered as an indicator of earlier leaf senescence\n(Figure 12). Drought\
    \ also leads to a signiﬁcant reduction\nin the thousand kernel weight (Figure\
    \ 10). Such results are\noften reported and well described in literature (e.g.,\
    \ Estrada-\nCampuzano et al., 2008) with eﬀects depending on the stress\nintensity\
    \ and on the plant-growth stage at the time of application\n(Fahad et al., 2017).\
    \ In the same way, induction of nitrogen\ndeﬁciency led to a reduction in the\
    \ yield compared to the\noptimum nitrogen conditions (at WW conditions). It is\
    \ also\nconsistent with literature relating the yield loss to a diminution\nof\
    \ ear density (e.g., Le Gouis et al., 2000). The performance of\ndiﬀerent bread\
    \ wheat varieties for yield and yield components\nvaried and could be relatively\
    \ contrasted in similar conditions.\nIndeed, it should be interesting for variety\
    \ characterization to\nobserve the impact of these diﬀerences on grain yield.\n\
    Diﬀerences linked to stress conditions were also noticed\nwith the embedded sensors\
    \ LIDARs, RGB cameras and\nspectroradiometers. First of all, these sensors provided\
    \ temporal\ninformation on wheat varieties and crop management systems.\nThe height\
    \ calculated with the LIDARs could be a good\nindicator of the onset and magnitude\
    \ of the plant’s stress\nFrontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org\n14\n\

    \ Platform\n(Madec et al., 2017) but also of the date of the starting\npoint of\
    \ stress impact. Similarly, the RGB cameras enable\nestimations of the GF (Figure\
    \ 12) and GPAI (Figure 11B).\nThe GPAI has been reported to be a relevant variable\
    \ for\nseveral key processes involved in canopy functioning (Baret\net al., 2010),\
    \ especially the stay-green of the LAI which\nparticipates in biomass accumulation.\
    \ It is acknowledged that\nwheat genotypes that sustain ﬂag-leaf photosynthesis\
    \ for longer\nperiods produce better yields (Christopher et al., 2008); therefore,\n\
    the start and rate of senescence of ﬂag leaves in wheat can\nbe used as an indicator\
    \ of stress resistance for determining\nresistance to stress (Larbi and Mekliche,\
    \ 2004). PhénoField\nR⃝\nsensors and the actual processing data are not allowing\
    \ us\nto look at ﬂag leaf alone but rather the plot canopy. Here,\nnitrogen deﬁciency\
    \ had a negative eﬀect earlier than drought\nas shown on GPAI (Figure 11B) but\
    \ also on plant height\n(Figure 11A). Strangely, at early stage (end of winter),\
    \ the WD\nmodality had a GPAI higher than that of the WW modality\n(Figure 11B).\
    \ A lack of nitrogen probably link to irrigation\non WW and a loss due to nitrogen\
    \ leaching could explain the\neﬀect on GPAI of the latter modality. The spectroradiometer\n\
    data are currently used to extract common vegetation indexes\n(as NDVI, MCARI2,\
    \ or MTCI). These vegetation indexes\nare complementary and used diﬀerently depending\
    \ on the\nphenological stage. They can be related to yield components\nand nitrogen\
    \ content (Dash and Curran, 2004; Walsh et al.,\n2018) as it was reported here\
    \ with the correlation between\nthe MTCI AUC and the nitrogen grain yield (Figure\
    \ 13).\nSuch indexes could, as the MTCI, discriminate the response\nof wheat varieties\
    \ to stress and so, explain varietal behaviors\n(Basso et al., 2016).\nIn addition\
    \ to temporal analyses, curves parameters whether\nthey are directly read on a\
    \ drawn curve direct or calculated from\na ﬁtted curve, could also be an alternative\
    \ way of analyzing data\nin high throughput phenotyping systems. Nevertheless,\
    \ stress\nindicators such as areas under the curve shown previously,\nappear to\
    \ be more relevant than using point values to explain\nperformance from high-throughput\
    \ phenotyping data.\nIt seems that these variables that describe the behaviors\n\
    of varieties will enrich breeding methodologies in order to\naccelerate genetic\
    \ progress especially given the predictions\nthat climate change will bring about\
    \ more drought and heat\nstress in the majority of wheat environments (Barros\
    \ et al.,\n2014). High throughput phenotyping (HTP) is particularly\nfast compared\
    \ to manual measurements and provides a non-\ndestructive method for accessing\
    \ physiological and biochemical\ntrait responses to environmental conditions (Araus\
    \ et al.,\n2018) at each development stage. The development of the\nHTP system\
    \ has originally focused on measurements of large\nnumbers of plants in controlled\
    \ environments. This approach\nprovided advanced knowledge of the plants’ physiological\n\
    processes. Nonetheless, studying plant responses in controlled\nenvironments representing\
    \ ﬁeld environments has well-known\nlimitations (White et al., 2012). So, developing\
    \ a ﬁeld platform\nlike the PhénoField\nR⃝ platform represents a novel type of\
    \ tool\ndedicated to assess the responses of crops to stress scenarios by\nusing\
    \ the HTP techniques in the ﬁeld.\nCONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK\nAs shown with 2017\
    \ dataset, the automated movement of the\n8 rainout shelters demonstrated its\
    \ performance to control\nwater and nitrogen deﬁciency on bread winter wheat ﬁeld\n\
    trials without other signiﬁcant impact on the trial environment.\nThis data set\
    \ is limited on genotype number to perform 3\nreplicates and 4 stress conditions.\
    \ PhénoField\nR⃝ platform, with\nits large plot capacity, could also provide genetics’\
    \ ﬁeld trials\nwith more than 300 genotypes under sole drought conditions\nand\
    \ enhance knowledge on physiological analyses, varieties\ntolerance evaluation\
    \ or genomic regions controlling these\ncomplex traits. 2017 was the 1st year\
    \ using ﬁeld HTP with a\ndata-processing pipeline that still has to be improved.\
    \ However,\nit showed promising results, especially with the dynamics of\nsensor\
    \ traits allowing the calculation of relevant indicators of\nabiotic stresses.\n\
    The actual set of sensors allows testing of many traits\nand new parameters to\
    \ select the best way to discriminate\nmodalities as varieties under nitrogen\
    \ or water deﬁciency. The\npossibilities to analyze the 2017 data set are really\
    \ important\nand we are aware that only a small part was explored in\nthis paper.\
    \ Nevertheless, our ﬁrst objective was to demonstrate\nthe PhénoField\nR⃝ platform’s\
    \ capacity to eﬃciently conduct the\ntest protocols (intensity and duration of\
    \ stress). Conducting\ntrials on ﬁeld HTP induced signiﬁcant soil environment\n\
    genotype interactions and, mapping the spatial variation of soil\ncharacteristics\
    \ (as well as WHC soil resistivity) is essential for\nincorporating ﬁeld variability\
    \ into crop management and for\nthe interpretation of experimental results. Acquisition\
    \ of ﬁeld\nphenotyping data is now a well-established process, allowing\nweekly\
    \ data registration from spectroradiometers, LiDARs and\nRGB cameras. Acquisition\
    \ of measurements for the entire\nplatform amounts to about 100 GB per day and\
    \ only a minor\npart of it is used to calculate the height, GPAI or vegetation\n\
    index presented here. In future publications, we will explore\nmore in details\
    \ curve parameters in regards to agronomic\ndata. Moreover, since 2018, the inversion\
    \ of radiative models\navailable in PhénoField\nR⃝ data processing chain allows\
    \ access\nto the chlorophyll content, which is even more relevant than\nthe vegetation\
    \ indexes in qualifying nitrogen stresses. Indeed,\nthe calculation of the commonly\
    \ used vegetation indexes\nonly used 1% of the available spectra and exploitation\
    \ of\nother wavelengths could highlight other physiological processes\n(Araus\
    \ et al., 2018).\nPhénoField\nR⃝ is also a platform acting as a ﬁeld HTP\nreference\
    \ used to calibrate and develop innovative phenotyping\ntools such as the set-up\
    \ of new sensors. Thus, measurements\nby drones can be compared to the acquisition\
    \ of gantries.\nDrones\nwill\nallow\ncomplementary\nsampling\nto\nintercept\n\

  explanation: This paper introduces a novel concept of closed-loop control in the
    context of automated irrigation systems. Closed-loop control enables real-time
    monitoring and adjustment of irrigation schedules based on actual field conditions,
    providing several advantages over traditional open-loop systems such as improved
    water efficiency, crop yield, and reduced environmental impact.

    In Australia gravity fed irrigation systems are critical infrastructure essential
    to agricultural production and export. By supplementing these large scale civil
    engineering systems with an appropriate information infrastructure, sensors, actuators
    and a communication network it is feasible to use systems engineering ideas to
    improve the exploitation of the irrigation system. This paper reports how classical
    ideas from system identification and control can be used to automate irrigation
    systems to deliver a near on-demand water supply with vastly improved overall
    distribution efficiency. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords

    broken pipes or pipe joints as a result of aging and deteriorating WDS infrastructures
    (Puust, Kapelan, Savic, & Koppel, 2010). Recent developments in information infrastructures
    and hydraulic sensor technology have enabled water companies to supplement these
    large scale civil engineering systems with appropriate sensors, actuators and
    a communication network; it is thus feasible to use systems engineering ideas
    to monitor the system in real-time and to develop methodologies for detecting
    and providing approximate locations of leaks (Mareels et al., 2005). Leakage diagnosis
    in water distribution systems has attracted a great deal of attention from both
    practitioners and researchers over the past years (Chan, Chin, & Zhong, 2018),

  explanation: This study focuses on the use of closed-loop control in an automated
    irrigation system, which uses real-time data to adjust water flow in order to
    improve efficiency. The key point of the paper is that the implementation of closed-loop
    control in this system has led to significant improvements in water distribution
    efficiency and quality of service for farmers. The system is able to meet water
    requests on demand, reduce water losses, and better regulate water levels, leading
    to overall water savings and improved crop yields.
  extract_1: The present positive results encourage the expansion of the research
    and development ideas to consider other aspects of water distribution, on-farm
    as well as urban.
  extract_2: On the basis of these outcomes large scale implementation in Victoria
    has commenced. The white paper on water released by the State Government of Victoria
    identified that the implementation of advanced control, along the lines expounded
    here, will save about 400 Mm3of water per year when completed across all of the
    irrigation districts in Victoria.

    content Abstract In Australia, gravity fed irrigation systems are critical infrastructure
    essential to agricultural production and export. By supplementing these large
    scale civil engineering systems with an appropriate information infrastructure,
    sensors, actuators and a communication network it is feasible to use systems engineering
    ideas to improve the exploitation of the irrigation system. This paper reports
    how classical ideas from system identification and control can be used to automate
    irrigation systems to deliver a near on-demand water supply with vastly improved
    overall distribution efficiency. Previous article in issue Next article in issue

    1. Introduction Over the last 7 years researchers at the University of Melbourne
    have collaborated with Rubicon Systems Australia to achieve near on-demand water
    supply in open channel irrigation systems. The research and development process
    started by considering what appeared to be a case of local controllers that created
    large excursion periodic flow and water levels in the water canals, perhaps due
    to bad tuning of the controller gains. The journey went through modeling and control
    design, including the development of new sensor and actuator hardware and pilot
    projects culminating in the present industrial scale ongoing project where based
    on the developed ideas and technology a large irrigation system in Victoria is
    being fully automated. Upon completion it will be the first entire irrigation
    system under closed loop control where water orders are met in real time on demand
    in as much as this is physically realisable. This paper reports on some aspects
    of this journey. A corresponding paper trail can be found in the bibliography.
    The patents Mareels et al., 2000, Mareels et al., 2001 describe the overall systems
    engineering philosophy in conjunction with the newly developed hardware for both
    measuring and controlling water in open channels. So far the research and development
    effort has focused on controlling water quantity in open channels, as captured
    in water flow, volume and water levels. This paper is solely devoted to this issue.
    In future developments it is envisaged that water quality will become a major
    focus for control. Sensors can assess the biological and chemical content of water
    to determine its quality in real time. The information infrastructure to be discussed
    can then be used to advantage to manage water quality as well as water quantity.
    In Australia, irrigation accounts for 70% of all fresh water usage Securing our
    Water Future Together, 2004, The United Nations World Water Development Report,
    Executive Summary, 2003, Water and the Australian Economy, 1999, Water Savings
    in Irrigation Distribution Systems, 2000. The majority of irrigation is achieved
    through an extensive civil infrastructure of reservoirs and open canals that supplies
    fresh water to farms. The large scale distribution of water is powered purely
    by gravity. Also on most farms, a gravity fed system is in use, such that the
    amount of farm land that can be irrigated through the on-farm water outlet is
    directly limited by the available water level (potential energy) at the canal
    outlet, the on-farm supply point. In the reports The United Nations World Water
    Development Report, Executive Summary, 2003, Water and the Australian Economy,
    1999, Water Savings in Irrigation Distribution Systems, 2000, overall water efficiency
    in irrigation, that is the ratio of volume of water used by crops and life stock
    to volume of water extracted from the available fresh water resource is estimated
    to be less than 50%. In Australia, the losses are reportedly evenly split Water
    and the Australian Economy, 1999, Water Savings in Irrigation Distribution Systems,
    2000 between the large scale distribution losses and on-farm losses. The latter
    are to a large extent due to poor timing of irrigation, a consequence of manual
    water scheduling on the supply canals. Furthermore, the on-farm losses if coupled
    with poor drainage lead to soil degradation (irrigation–drainage imbalance induced
    salination of soils). Most of the large scale distribution losses are due to the
    natural tendency to oversupply water, as a lack of water has obviously averse
    effects on the yield. Some losses are due to evaporation and canal seepage. In
    Australia, over supplied water simply means that water spills out at the downstream
    end of the irrigation system, and is no longer available to supply irrigation.
    The water remains of course part of the natural hydro cycle. Policy makers in
    Australia have recognized that is important to re-consider present water practices
    in view of long term environmental and sustainability issues. Indeed, Australia
    is a very dry continent that presumably cannot sustain the present exploitation
    levels of its natural water resources. Climate change, population and industrial
    growth pressures compound the problem. Here, it is argued that irrigation efficiency
    is an ideal objective for closed loop control. Irrigation efficiency can be vastly
    improved by installing an information technology infrastructure: sensors and actuators
    linked through a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) communication
    network. The data derived from this can be exploited using systems identification
    and control techniques to manage the civil infrastructure to achieve superior
    efficiency and support new policies in support of long term sustainable water
    use. Besides the improved distribution efficiency, the near on-demand water delivery
    that is achieved leads to significant on-farm efficiency improvements as well.
    The system identification and control ideas to be discussed are quite classical,
    and in this way the paper illustrates the strength of the present state of the
    art in control and systems identification theory. Nevertheless, new questions
    or perhaps new emphases appear and a number of interesting open problems that
    are particularly relevant to large scale systems engineering are identified. The
    remainder of the paper is organized as follows. First, a particular implementation
    of an automated, SCADA-equipped irrigation system, installed in Victoria, Australia
    is described. The physical constraints in the irrigation infrastructure, which
    ultimately limit the performance that can be achieved, are touched upon. The control
    and management objectives are briefly outlined. System modeling is discussed next.
    Models derived from the St-Venant equations and grey box models are compared as
    to their utility/effort in the context of modeling for control and fault detection.
    Next, model based control ideas are pursued. A variety of distributed control
    and centralised control strategies are briefly introduced. More importantly the
    impact of automation and the diminishing returns of increased control effort and
    control sophistication are identified. Results from the field describing the quality
    of the proposed models and controls are discussed. 2. Irrigation systems 2.1.
    Canal infrastructure Refer to Fig. 1. Through a series of open canals, water is
    distributed from reservoirs to farms under the driving force of the available
    potential energy at the reservoir. The routing and scheduling of water is realized
    through the adjustment of regulator structures (gates) placed in the canals. These
    gates restrict the water flow in the canals. A stretch of canal between up- and
    down-stream gates is called a pool. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1.
    Schematic representation of open canal infrastructure; vertical cross section
    through canal centre. A section of a canal network is represented in Fig. 2. The
    canal topology can be represented like a directed graph (nodes are regulators,
    arcs are pools, the direction is the flow). In most gravity fed systems the graph
    is a tree (but this is not always the case). Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 2. Schematic representation of open canal topology. The discussion here focuses
    on the so-called overshot gates (FlumeGate ™ )1 that were developed in the course
    of the project. In these gates, water flows over the top of the gate leaf, the
    angle of which can be adjusted to change the amount of water that flows over it.
    The gates can operate in the overflow regime, where the down stream water level
    is below the gate level (as on the left in Fig. 1), or drowned condition, where
    the downstream level is above the gate level (as is illustrated on the right in
    Fig. 1). At the gate water levels immediately downstream and upstream of the gate
    are measured. The main farm outlets are found near the downstream end of a pool.
    In Australia, the canals are designed for flow, and are rather shallow and narrow,
    with little storage in pools. A typical slope of the canal floor is 1/10,000.
    The canals have little free board, in most instances water will spill if the water
    level would reach 0.5 m above the design level. The canal and reservoir infrastructure
    is substantial. The replacement value (for Australia) is in the order of several
    tens of billion dollars in investment. To understand the scale, consider the following
    data for a medium size irrigation district in Australia that was used in the pilot
    projects described here: 500 km of main irrigation canal; about 500 regulator
    structures in the canals; over 600 on-farm outlets; 1.1 Gm2 of farm land irrigated;
    an annual water allocation of about 0.6 Gm3. The Goulburn-Murray irrigation district,
    the largest in Australia, is more than 10 times this size (7000 km of canal; 17,000
    regulators and 21,000 on-farm outlets, annual average irrigation water allocation
    in excess of 2 Gm3) and irrigation districts in excess of 100 times this size
    exist in the USA, Pakistan, India and China. The quality of the irrigation service,
    from a farmer’s perspective, is determined by the timing of the irrigation water
    and in case the on-farm irrigation is also gravity fed, also by the water level
    at the on-farm outlet. Clearly using open canals with banks that are not water
    tight to effect water distribution implies losses through evaporation and seepage.
    The combined effect of these is estimated at around 10 to 15% of supply (Water
    and the Australian Economy, 1999). At present these losses are insufficient to
    warrant consideration of replacing the canal infrastructure by a piped water network
    (which after all also has its own problems with leaks). 2.2. Automation infrastructure
    Fig. 3 illustrates in situ the new hardware replacing the manually controlled
    on-farm outlets. During the course of the project, new sensors and actuators were
    developed which form the subject of two patent applications Mareels et al., 2000,
    Mareels et al., 2001. The actual locations for the gates in the canals are as
    determined by the existing infrastructure under manual control, and no optimization
    of gate placement, in view of the new and automated management regime, has been
    considered thus far. This is an interesting aspect of the overall system design
    that is under further investigation. Download : Download full-size image Fig.
    3. Automated gates and communication infrastructure. For the purpose of distributing
    water from reservoir to farm, all the gates both in the main canals as well as
    the on-farm outlets, are actuated and equipped with sensors for water levels and
    actual gate position (the gate angle is measured). The fact that on-farm outlets
    are also actuated and equipped with sensors enables inter alia the measurement
    of the actual water demand. Actuation and monitoring functions are typically collocated,
    and very few sole purpose actuator or monitoring sites are in use. Each gate/site
    can communicate via a cellular packet based radio network to any other site in
    the network. The communication network enables both broadcasting (e.g. for software
    upgrades) as well as peer to peer communications on all sites. A typical direct
    peer group contains up to 10 sites (see also Fig. 2). For the above described
    average irrigation district there are just over a 1000 sites, the maximum number
    of router hops for site to site communications is six, whereas a direct communication
    to the centralnode requires at most three router hops. For reasons of security
    and reliability, the network management overhead in data communication is large,
    and the actual net data throughput is very low (measured in bits per second).
    The required data rate for control purposes is kept to a minimum by using event
    driven communication and by using a particular decentralized control structure.
    Event based communication means that measurement data are only communicated when
    a water level change (a gate movement or a set point change) exceeds a predetermined
    threshold. Even then, the sensor data must compete with other event driven communications
    such as demanded by various hardware and software alarms. As a consequence the
    time required to successfully complete a communication cannot be guaranteed with
    certainty. Although and this is confirmed by experience over a few irrigation
    seasons, the design methods for the communication network are such that with very
    high confidence the maximum communication delay for a data packet can be specified.
    The other technique used to minimize the data rate requirements is the particular
    decentralized control structure that is implemented. It is such that water demand
    information only has to be passed on to the nearest upstream regulator, which
    only requires a peer to peer session, without supervisory intervention. Moreover,
    the central supervisory control node does not need regular sampling of sensors
    and/or actuator states and can use the event driven data to implement global network
    policies. Locally, at the gate level, all data about sensors, actuators and hardware
    conditions are monitored on a regularly sampled basis, and a long history of all
    variables is maintained in memory. At the central node, a global data base of
    all reported and requested events is maintained. In this data base, the topology
    of both the information network and the irrigation network is also stored. This
    topology is further enhanced by descriptors for all models for pools, regulators
    and sensors, and the corresponding control algorithms. 2.3. Objectives From a
    real-time control point of view the main objectives are: • optimization of distribution
    efficiency, i.e. minimize the total amount of water supplied by matching supply
    to demand. Maximal distribution efficiency is attained when there is a zero outflow
    at the bottom end of the canal tree; • real-time on-demand water supply of the
    requested water volumes to all irrigation outlets; and • water level regulation
    at the on-farm outlet to a given set point (within an agreed dead-band limit).
    The supervisory control has to ensure that the physical flow capacities are not
    exceeded, that the water set points are as agreed by the stake holders and that
    the distributed water remains within the allocations set by the regulating bodies
    (as modified by water trade). Clearly, the supervisory control task is in itself
    a dynamic object. The supervisory control system receives demand requests by the
    farmers through an automated ordering system. These orders are verified, if the
    water order is legitimate and if there is the physical capacity to supply before
    the water order is processed. If rejected, the water order can be rescheduled
    to an agreed time. The supervisory control system can suggest alternative time
    slots for the water order. These aspects are not discussed further. That some
    form of rescheduling is in general unavoidable is clear from the histogram in
    Fig. 4. It shows the distribution of regulator sizes (in flow m3/s) for one section
    of the above irrigation system. The total on-farm installed outflow capacity in
    this section is close to 25 m3/s, which is a little more than four times the inflow
    capacity (the in flow capacity at the top regulator is 6.1 m3/s). This is typical
    across the entire irrigation system. Download : Download full-size image Fig.
    4. Histogram of regulator sizes in m3/s at the downstream end in a typical irrigation
    district. Equally important from a management perspective is to keep track of
    water flow and water volumes, as well as the general condition of the irrigation
    canals (e.g. leakage detection, evaporation losses, hardware failures). 3. Models
    for irrigation systems Understanding the behaviour of the irrigation system is
    key to arriving at an acceptable closed loop control solution. The natural subsystems
    in irrigation systems are a single pool and the regulator structures. Given the
    topology of the irrigation system, an entire model is then but the concatenation
    of pool and regulator models as dictated by the system topology (see Fig. 2).
    3.1. St-Venant equation based models Traditionally, open channel dynamics are
    described using the shallow water equations, or the so called St-Venant equations
    Brutsaert, 1971, Chaudhry, 1993, Cunge et al., 1980. One particular representation
    is given by (1) which models the mass balance along the length of the pool, and
    (2) which models the momentum balance along the length of the pool. Here, is time,
    and is a position along the centre line of the pool, where is the length of the
    i th pool. In (1), (2), is the water cross section at position xalong the center
    line of pool i at time t (it equals the local depth of water times the width of
    the canal). is the width of the pool at position x, it is assumed that the cross
    section of the canal is rectangular. The width information can be obtained either
    from design drawings, or perhaps more interestingly from satellite images. is
    the total flow in m3/s through the cross section . represents the flow off-take
    per meter canal (in m2/s) at position x. This term models not only a farm outlet,
    or an off-take into another pool/canal but also accounts for seepage and evaporation
    (hence the potential dependence on time, as seepage is subject to seasonal variation
    and evaporation experiences seasonal and diurnal variations). The represents the
    momentum loss per meter canal, due to friction but also water off-takes, seepage
    and evaporation. represents the slope of the bottom of pool i. The latter represents
    essentially the available potential energy per meter canal. The constant represents
    gravitational acceleration. The friction term is a nonlinear function of flow
    and area, for which various empirical formulas exist. Here, modeled as time-invariant,
    although slow time variations can be expected due to effects such as bank erosion
    and plant growth. The boundary conditions are the inflow into the top-end of the
    pool and the outflow at the bottom-end of the pool. These are to be derived from
    the hydraulic characteristics of the regulating structures at the up- and down-stream
    end of the pools. For , this will typically be a discharge from a reservoir, or
    major feed canal. for each of the end pools is to be minimised, ideally zero outflow
    is to be achieved. For the other boundary conditions , where is the hydraulic
    characteristic for that regulator, and is the control variable, which enables
    the variation of the flow through this regulator. Hydraulic characteristics can
    be determined from experimental data. Hydraulic characteristics essentially relate
    geometry of the regulator, as captured by the down and up-stream water conditions
    and the gate position to flow over the regulator. To complete the model for the
    purpose of prediction an initial condition has to be provided, a suitable starting
    point is a steady state flow condition (zero flow for example). The models (1),
    (2) are nonlinear partial differential equations, which can be solved using a
    numerical integration scheme. Typically, a Preismann scheme, which involves using
    a discretisation in both space and time domain Chaudhry, 1993, Cunge et al., 1980
    is advocated. Despite the obvious physical interpretation that is associated with
    the variables, and the clear validity of the principles on which the St-Venant
    equations are constructed, these equations represent a considerable modeling cost
    when they are to be applied to a particular canal. In order for the model to become
    relevant to a particular canal, or pool it is necessary to fit functions like
    , , and . Typically this involves providing a parametric representation for these
    functions, and then estimating the parameters, using say non-linear least squares
    techniques, from a history of measurements. The mapping from the discrete values
    of flow and cross sections at certain positions along the canal, and at certain
    time instances to the parameters is not trivial. One such approach is discussed
    in some detail in (Ooi, Krutzen, & Weyer, 2003). It is shown there that the St-Venant
    equations are indeed adequate for the purpose of modeling of open channel behaviour.
    This study uses data from Australian irrigation canals. An earlier study (Brutsaert,
    1971)also shows the adequacy of the St-Venant equation using a similarity study
    under laboratory conditions. Despite this, it is not clear that the cost of establishing
    an accurate quantitative model using this route is actually justified in the context
    of irrigation systems. Moreover, it is also not obvious that the St-Venant equations
    represent the most appropriate starting point for management and/or control of
    irrigation systems. In a nutshell, the advantage of the St-Venant equations, with
    the corresponding boundary and initial conditions, are: • familiar and physically
    relevant variables are modeled; • parameters have an obvious physical interpretation;
    • interpolation across all time and space (simulation information not limited
    to discrete sample points); and • an expectation to be reliable across a broad
    range of operating conditions. These have to be weighted against the obvious disadvantages:
    • significant cost in achieving quantitatively reliable models from discrete data;
    • significant cost, perhaps prohibitive cost to simulate an entire canal or irrigation
    system; and • relevance beyond the operational regimes remains questionable as
    it cannot be verified against real data. There is a more philosophical and more
    fundamental objection rooted in the way the St-Venant equations are actually used.
    As the St-Venant equations do not permit analytic solutions they are by necessity
    numerically integrated using some discretisation scheme. One could therefore argue
    that for all practical purposes the St-Venant equations are merely an abstraction
    (and perhaps a poor one). Clearly only the finite dimensional numerical approximation,
    a computer algorithm, is the real model. It is this computer algorithm that is
    tuned against the data and that forms the actual model and that predicts the actual
    behaviour. This begs a number of natural questions: • Can this finite dimensional
    and discrete time/space model not be considered as the basis for control design?
    • Which discretisation scheme is the most appropriate for control design? After
    all, only a small portion of the open-loop behaviour is targeted in closed-loop
    operation and there may be better schemes than the Preismann scheme. • Perhaps
    the model may be further simplified using model order reduction techniques to
    represent only adequately the smaller closed loop behaviour Litrico and Fromion,
    2004, Litrico et al., 2003. Rather than pursuing these questions from a St-Venant
    equation perspective, which leads to several interesting open problems in the
    study of infinite dimensional systems, they are pursued directly from a data-to-model
    system identification perspective. 3.2. Grey box models The above motivates the
    consideration of a grey box, lumped model approach to construct a model for a
    pool adequate for control design in an irrigation system Eurén and Weyer, 2005,
    Ooi et al., 2003, Ooi et al., 2003, Ooi, 2003, Ooi et al., 2005, Weyer, 2001.
    It should be observed that significant simplifications as compared to the full
    complexity of the St-Venant equations may be expected as the management regime
    in an irrigation system requires tight control over the water levels, despite
    significant variations in flow. Hence, the model does not have to explain the
    behaviour over all possible water levels. What is minimally required is a model
    that links the control input which is the gate position at regulator i (a regulator
    may have several gates in parallel, but this issue is ignored to simplify the
    presentation) to water levels and flows at the critical points along the canals,
    typically the up- ( ) and down-stream water levels at the regulators. With reference
    to Fig. 5 consider a canal where all pools are simply in line. To further simplify
    the exposition, assume that the regulators are overshot gates in free-flow conditions.
    In this situation, the downstream water levels at the regulators are largely irrelevant.
    The ideas can be applied mutatis mutandis to other situations as well, including
    the more complicated situations with under shot regulators and drowned overshot
    gates (Eurén & Weyer, 2005). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. In-line
    canal system, a series of regulators and pools. The flow over the regulator i
    is a static function determined by the geometry of the regulator, which is varied
    by the gate position and the supply water level at the regulator site. This relationship
    is the hydraulic characteristic for the regulator, (3) Besides the hydraulic characteristic,
    a model for the dynamics of the pool is required. This model is in its simplest
    form a mass balance, the volume of water in the pool is increased by the flow
    over the up-stream regulator and decreased by the flow over the down-stream regulator.
    In Mareels et al., 2000, Mareels et al., 2001, Weyer, 2001, a model is proposed
    that captures conservation of mass, and the first mode of standing waves in a
    pool: (4) A continuous time model is used, as in general regular sampling is not
    available. This is therefore the preferred embodiment of the model. Although for
    identification purposes it is clear that the above model only requires local information
    at the upstream and downstream gate of the pool. In this situation, it is possible
    to obtain regularly sampled and synchronized data series of the water levels and
    gate positions for any particular pool. In (4), is the water level upstream of
    regulator i; is a time-delay. It is associated with the fastest wave phenomena
    in the pool between gates i and (which can be linked to the critical velocity
    in the pool (Chaudhry, 1993)). An action on the upstream end of the pool is observed
    at the downstream end of the pool after time units. The model dynamics are captured
    via the polynomial . For short pools, up to a few km in length, a polynomial of
    degree 3 suffices to achieve a high fidelity model. For such pools, the roots
    of consist of an integrator and a weakly damped oscillatory pair. The integrator
    captures the idea of water storage in the pool. The oscillatory roots capture
    the dynamics associated with the dominant standing wave(s) in the pool. The terms
    represent water off-takes between regulator i and and the are static gains. (Most
    off-takes are placed near the down-stream end of the pool, which simplifies the
    model, and ensures better quality of service for the farmer, as the down stream
    water level can be regulated more easily than the up stream water level.) Typical
    order of magnitudes for the various parameters in the Australian irrigation districts
    where field trials have been conducted thus far are: • time delay is approximately
    3 min per km; • dominant wave period is approximately 9 min per km; and • achievable
    (closed loop) dominant time constant is approximately 10 to 15 min per km. The
    parameters appearing in (4) are readily obtained via standard linear system identification
    techniques. This can be done both from open loop experiments as well as from closed
    loop data Ooi et al., 2003, Ooi et al., 2003, Ooi and Weyer, 2001, Ooi et al.,
    2005, Weyer, 2001. The latter is critically important when considering a large
    scale irrigation system. The grey box model (4) compares favourably with the St-Venant
    models (1), (2) in that it has much lower complexity and yet similar or better
    prediction accuracy (see below and Fig. 6). Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 6. Experimental validation of grey box and St-Venant based models. Validation
    tests across both low and high flow regimes have been completed. In Fig. 6, adapted
    from Ooi, Krutzen, & Weyer, 2003, a comparison is made between the St-Venant based
    models and the grey box models. The Fig. 6 represents a set of open-loop simulated
    model responses compared against the actual field measurements. The inputs to
    the simulation are the regulator positions over time (using the measured positions),
    and the initial water level condition. The data set for the modeling and validation
    are from different irrigation seasons. The least accurate model, which is still
    very useful, is the St-Venant model where the model parameters are not tuned to
    the actual pool but guestimated based on a rule of thumb. The response is the
    dashed line in Fig. 6. This model is by no means disgraced. The other St-Venant
    model has its parameters (a model for the friction was adjusted) optimally selected
    based on field observations. Its response is dash–dot line in Fig. 6. These models
    are compared against a grey box model that uses a third order model, (leaky) integrator
    and standing waves and a first order grey box model that only captures the (leaky)
    integrator trends. The grey box models have been identified from open-loop experiments.
    All models are reasonably accurate. From a simulation perspective, the best model,
    based on quality for effort, is the third order grey box model. For control purposes
    the first order grey box model will suffice, when the wave phenomena are appropriately
    considered in the closed loop design (Weyer, 2003a). 3.3. Automated model building
    Given the size of a typical irrigation system automated model building and model
    maintenance is essential. Model maintenance must be performed within the constraints
    imposed by normal management conditions. As demonstrated in (Ooi & Weyer, 2001)
    the grey box model (4) allow for simple calibration of the parameters under closed
    loop conditions. A few hours of data, using permitted changes in the water level
    reference set points, exploiting the available dead band, suffices to tune the
    model parameters. Such variation is allowed under normal operating conditions
    as the typical dead band for the set point regulation is of the order of 10 cm
    (under manual operation, water levels were deemed acceptably regulated when less
    than 30 cm away from set points). Fig. 7 taken from (Ooi & Weyer, 2001)compares
    a validation data set (black solid line) with a simulation (dotted line) based
    on a model derived from closed loop data. Only 90 min of closed loop data with
    minimal set point variations were used to derive the relevant parameters of a
    first order grey box model (4) that sufficed for control design purposes. Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 7. Validating closed loop system identification,
    using grey box models. It is important to notice that the tuning of the model
    for a particular pool is inherently a decentralized task. It involves only data
    gathered from the up-stream and down-stream regulators. Given the available compute
    engines at the various monitoring sites a model update can be performed locally
    using peer-to-peer communications. Once the modeling or model maintenance is completed,
    the new model parameters can be communicated to the central node, which requires
    very little communication resources, as it only involves a few coefficients to
    be updated. In case of hardware failures (Choy & Weyer, 2005), like a regulator
    break-down, or sensor failure, an alarm is raised that also triggers a model update
    (and if necessary a control law update) to reflect the new dynamics. A model for
    an entire irrigation system is constructed from the logical interconnection of
    the individual pool models. 3.4. An open modeling issue The apparent data-based
    validation of both a St-Venant partial differential equation model and a low order
    grey box model within the present context poses an interesting and open question
    in model order reduction Besancon et al., 2001, Litrico and Fromion, 2004, Litrico
    et al., 2003. Under what conditions and in what sense can the grey box model (4)
    be considered as an approximation for the coupled partial differential equation
    model (1) and (2). This question is not only of academic interest. The basic parameters
    in the grey box model have a physical meaning, the dominant time constant, the
    wave period and time-delay are all related to the behaviour of the St-Venant equations.
    If the relationship between the St-Venant equations and the grey box model is
    better understood it may be possible to derive a simple map, a rule of thumb,
    linking physical parameters like pool length, critical velocity, Manning coefficient
    (an important parameter describing the friction losses in open channel flow) to
    a reasonable first guess for the coefficients in the grey box model. At present
    such a map is essentially being constructed from experience. An answer to the
    above open problem would provide a sound theoretical basis for such a rule of
    thumb. The question is not trivial in that even taking into account that the water
    levels are reasonably tightly controlled the St-Venant Eq. (2) remain highly nonlinear
    due to their nonlinear dependence on the flow. Hence classical model order reduction
    techniques do not apply. The situation is a nonlinear version of the classical
    lumped parameter Pi and T-section approximations used in electrical power engineering
    to represent a transmission line. Transmission line equations are linear St-Venant
    equations. 3.5. On-line model uses The need for a low complexity model structure
    like the grey box model cannot be argued solely on the basis of simulation or
    control design requirements. Indeed simulation and most control design techniques
    only use the model in an off-line capacity in which complexity plays a lesser
    role. (In the course of this project we have as yet not pursued model predictive
    control ideas for which low complexity models are definitely an advantage.) The
    model is used in the supervisory control to determine the limits of physical capability
    of the irrigation system to meet demand. Off-line an approximate table can be
    constructed that indicates which demand can be met in real time, but it is simpler
    and more accurate to actually calculate from the present state of the model forward
    to verify that the physical constraints can be satisfied (the present scheduling
    policy works on a first come first served basis). The model has however far more
    important on-line uses, which justify a low order complexity model. The main on-line
    use of the model is in fault detection and fault isolation. The single most valuable
    use of the model in this respect is the identification in real-time of leaks,
    which are identified and localized, as a (significant) difference between water
    levels predicted by the model and actually achieved water levels as measured by
    the sensors. The development of fault detection methods that exploit the full
    capabilities of the model and sensory data is ongoing. 4. Control for irrigation
    systems In the following discussion, consider a series of in-line pools (see Fig.
    5), and assume overshot gates at the regulators. Other approaches, not discussed
    here, for control of canals can be found in Halleux et al., 2003, Malaterre and
    Baume, 1998, Schuurmans et al., 1999. From a control perspective, and to simplify
    the discussion, the predictive models discussed above can be further simplified.
    Indeed, as the wave dynamics of the pools are not to be excited, because the free
    space in the canals above the water level is not designed to cope with standing
    waves, this part of the model may be ignored for control design as long as the
    design ensures that the waves are not going to be excited. The main wave frequency
    from the model is thus an important input into the control design process, it
    determines the bandwidth of the closed loop system. With this simplification,
    and introducing appropriate scaling and some abuse of notation, the pool dynamics,
    represented in continuous time, are given by (5) The index irefers to the regulator
    i, . The are the input variables, which are actually nonlinear functions of the
    gate positions and the water levels at the regulator. This representation globally
    linearises the non-linear behaviour of the canal; although the inputs are constrained
    in that . The disturbance is the total water off-take from pool i (upstream of
    regulator and downstream from regulator i). As discussed above, it is (almost)
    a measurable disturbance, although some aspects of the off-take term cannot be
    measured directly. Evaporation, seepage and unscheduled off-takes caused by bank
    erosion or bank collapse are clearly difficult to measure directly. The evaporation
    and seepage are only a small fraction of the total off-take, and the unscheduled
    off-takes can be identified from the model. The simplest control objective is
    to ensure that (no outflow at the bottom regulator) and that all are regulated
    to their reference values , (within a deadband). In this case, setpoint regulation
    automatically delivers water on demand, provided that in steady state demand is
    within the capacity constraint, that is for all . 4.1. Decentralised Control A
    decentralized control design is discussed in detail in (Weyer, 2002) see also
    (Li, Cantoni, & Weyer, 2005). The main features are that the upstream regulator
    input is used to regulate the water level based on information that is available
    at the down stream regulator and the local regulator i as well as the measured
    off-take on the pool i. The controller can thus be implemented using a peer-to-peer
    communication session. is set to zero. Assuming (perhaps incorrectly) that the
    off-take is measurable, the decentralized control law takes the form: (6) Here,
    and . is the feed forward control part and implements local feedback. This leads
    to the closed loop being described by (7) with and and (8) This representation
    shows clearly how disturbances propagate upstream; affects all for . The decentralised
    design is by necessity a trade-off between how much the local disturbance is rejected
    from the water level and how these disturbances propagate upstream, the effect
    on for . The transfer function governing the upstream propagation of disturbances
    is (9) the local rejection is governed by (10) The critical element in these transfer
    functions is the delay. A similar argument can be developed for when the off-take
    is not measurable. In this case, the control law takes the form (11) starting
    with . The corresponding closed loop is described by the iteration ( ) (12) which
    describes the regulator inputs and (13) which describes the error-propagation.
    Here, (14) and (15) 4.2. Decentralised control, without off-take measurements
    When the off-takes may not be measured, the feedback must include an integrator
    in order to reject the off-take disturbances . This makes the control design much
    more challenging as the plant also contains an integrator. In the presence of
    a double integrator and having to contend with the unavoidable delay in the transfer
    functions , , and (see Eqs. (9), (10), (14), (15)), it can be shown that is now
    impossible to avoid that water levels errors are amplified as they propagate upstream
    along the canal. In (Li et al., 2005), it is demonstrated that for any linear
    (stable) design . The way to arrive at a good design is to achieve strong disturbance
    rejection by way of ensuring that . In this way, even very long chains of pools
    can be adequately controlled.2 The design proceeds in two phases, first stability/robustness
    is guaranteed for the local pool dynamics (design emphasis on ); a phase margin
    of about 40∘ and a gain margin of about 10 dB is considered adequate. A feedback
    consisting of a PI controller, with low pass filter as to avoid the excitation
    of the wave dynamics, i.e. , can achieve this goal. The feed forward term is essentially
    a low pass filter, again to ensure that waves are not excited. Moreover, the feed
    forward term must be designed with care to avoid the amplification of disturbances
    along the canal. To complete the design, the control objectives are verified against
    the entire system dynamics. This boils down to the non-trivial verification of
    the transfer functions . Figs. 8, Fig. 9, Fig. 10 illustrate the response of the
    decentralized controller (PI + filter) under a control test scenario on one of
    the main canals. The set point is the dash–dot line and the solid line is the
    recorded water level realized by the controller. Several set point changes and
    disturbances occur over the period of time (a bit more than a day’s worth of data
    is displayed). The controller maintains the water level to better than 5 cm. Download

    Assuming that the off-takes are measured, it is possible to use a simple lead–lag
    controller in the feedback path ( ) and a simple low pass filter in the feed forward
    path. The design is somewhat simplified in this situation as compared to the design
    based on the integrator in the feedback path. The only relevant transfer functions
    are and , which makes it indeed somewhat easier to achieve acceptable gain and
    phase margins as well as disturbance rejection. The main design problem concerns
    the feed forward action, as this dominates the error propagation along the canals.
    As the design is only marginally easier than the PI based design, the PI based
    design, which has greater robustness with respect to off-takes, is to be preferred.
    4.4. Centralised control Based on the model (5) linear quadratic methods as well
    as design methods may be pursued to deliver a global controller see Li et al.,
    2004, Li et al., 2005, Weyer, 2003c. These serve as benchmarks for the decentralized
    controllers. The information infrastructure briefly discussed above does not enable
    one to implement a central control strategy across an entire irrigation district.
    Linear quadratic, centralised controllers have been field tested in smallish irrigation
    systems. Besides serving as a benchmark for the decentralized controllers, a centralized
    control law can be used to derive an acceptable decentralized controller, through
    pruning the weaker input–output connections. To complete an adequate linear quadratic
    design it is essential to augment the state of the system (water levels ) with
    the integrals of the regulation errors ( ) and states to describe high pass filtered
    input variables (emphasizing the frequency content above the standing wave frequency
    of the pool that can be effected by the particular input variable). The latter
    are essential to avoid excitation of standing waves in the pools. A linear quadratic
    design completed along these lines provides an overall responsiveness better than
    what can be achieved using the above decentralized controller, with acceptable
    robustness properties. The design process is however much more demanding. In particular
    the selection of the quadratic weights so as to achieve an intuitively acceptable
    response is a time-consuming task. The intuition derived from the decentralized
    controller can be used to better advantage in an design. The decentralized controller
    can be used to deliver the loop shaping that is required to achieve a high gain
    in the low frequency band (to reject the load disturbances), a 20 dB/dec roll
    off around the cross over frequency (which is limited by the wave frequency) to
    achieve sufficient phase margin, and faster roll-off around and beyond the wave
    frequencies. Using the decentralized controller to guide the selection of the
    loop shaping frequency dependent weights, allows the design method to deliver
    a very robust and high performing controller that satisfies all control requirements.
    The resulting controller is a global controller, with a performance similar to
    a well designed linear quadratic controller. The advantage is that the design
    effort is much smaller than what is required for the linear quadratic controller,
    and entirely comparable to the decentralized controller. Field tests are planned
    for the near future. 4.5. A law of diminishing returns In order to appreciate
    the benefit that may be derived from the various control scenarios, a comparison
    is made between: • manual control, the present situation, where water orders are
    averaged, and water regulation is effected once every 24 h by manually adjusting
    the regulator structures. • decentralized control, without feed forward; PI + filter
    design using a simple anti-windup scheme. • decentralized control, with feed forward;
    PI + filter design using a simple anti-windup scheme. • global, centralized control
    (using a linear quadratic regulator). The comparison is based on a three-pool
    simulation, where the scenarios have been implemented on an equal footing. All
    control implementations encounter identical circumstances. The scenario stretches
    over a 9-day period. It involves: • A water order cancellation. Half-way through
    the simulation, a water order (45 h long order of 37,500 m3) is cancelled. Farmers
    can order water, typically 4 days in advance, but are allowed to cancel the order
    with only one hour notice. This is a very demanding scenario from a manual regulation
    point of view, but realistic. • A 2.5-cm rain event that last for 10 h. Under
    rain conditions, farmers are allowed to stop irrigation. This leads to an emergency
    stop of the irrigation system, which is virtually impossible to control well under
    manual operations. • Ten normal water orders, of various length and magnitude.
    The water orders are organized as per typical manual operations, so as to create
    a situation advantageous for manual operations. The scenario is illustrated in
    Fig. 11, in which the head over the most upstream regulator is indicated. This
    illustrates the water supply into the canal, which is the main control action
    to implement the down stream requested water orders. Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 11. Water supply over a 9 day period into an irrigation canal. The
    results are that any of the automated methods achieve all the water orders as
    requested and avoid spilling water during the rain condition. The decentralized
    control strategies achieve 100% water efficiency in that no water is spilled over
    the most down stream regulator. The linear quadratic regulator controller achieves
    quicker and better water level regulation (barely noticeable) and an overall efficiency
    of 99%. (The LQ regulator sacrifices a minimal amount of water in favour of achieving
    a better water level regulation.) Of course this is not the whole story, nevertheless
    this particular simulation study suggests that there is little incentive to implement
    a centralized control strategy. The corresponding water level response in the
    most down stream pool is illustrated in Fig. 12. This pool is the most difficult
    to manage well under manual control. Typically the bottom end of the irrigation
    system experiences poor quality of service under manual operations. The same Figure
    illustrates that using the decentralized controllers there is saturation during
    the rain event (regulators are closed) and at the end of the irrigation period,
    when there is a small excess of water supply without outflow. This water supplied
    in excess is stored in the most down stream pool. Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 12. Waterlevel response in the most downstream pool. Under manual operations,
    the overall efficiency was 80% (which is very good compared to historical averages,
    typical best practice manual operation achieves an efficiency of about 70%). The
    quality of service is however poor, despite the fact that the water orders were
    placed as to be advantageous to manual control. Only 90% of the water orders is
    met. The water levels dropped below the minimum required to satisfy the requested
    demand over about 10% of the total duration. Moreover, during the rain period,
    the most down stream pool flooded its banks for about a day. The rain period only
    lasted for 10 h, but there was a significant water flow imbalance at the beginning
    of the rain period, which together with the slow response of manual control, aggravated
    the rain effect to cause significant flooding. To observe substantial differences
    between the different forms of automated, real-time, irrigation management, larger
    canal systems must be compared. Various scenarios have been simulated, and it
    quickly becomes clear that decentralized control with feed forward (and anti-windup)
    achieves near global optimal performance. In most scenarios its performance cannot
    be distinguished from centralized control (which cannot be implemented) and it
    is substantially better than the decentralized control without feed forward. The
    latter suffers from a larger variation in water levels, and cannot always supply
    water orders as requested because water levels fall below the agreed minimum supply
    point. 4.6. Implementation issues There are two main implementation issues to
    contend with: sampling and saturation. As pointed out, the information infrastructure
    does not allow for regular sampling. Globally sampling is performed on an event
    basis (e.g. only the time that a water level changes by 2 cm up or down is reported),
    although locally, at each site regular sampling is performed. The decentralized
    controller does not suffer, as it only uses local information. A global controller
    must be designed as to cope with rather varying information rates and delays across
    the range of variables it requires to compute the control inputs. Substantial
    further research work is necessary. This issue is at the heart of so called network
    control. An alternative approach to communication limited control is exposed in
    for example (Nair, Evans, Mareels, & Moran, 2004), where an information theoretic
    point of view is pursued. The latter identifies the minimum data rates required
    to achieve stability. It turns out that in the case at hand, as the instability
    in the plant is limited to a chain of integrators that any non-zero communication
    rate suffices to achieve stability. Of course, this does not imply good performance,
    but it indicates that the required communication cannot be demanding. This is
    in-line with the present engineering solution and experience. Saturation issues
    can be addressed using anti-windup control ideas. The design can be completed,
    and consequently adapted as to ensure smooth feedback without integrator saturation
    Zaccarian et al., 2004, Zaccarian et al., 2004. Simple anti-windup control is
    implemented. 4.7. Open issues There are a number of interesting open aspects from
    a theoretical point of view that have received little attention in the control
    literature. In particular, event-based sampling and disturbance propagation in
    the irrigation system require further work. The latter is made difficult because
    of the combination of marginally stable open loop dynamics combined with delays.
    Although no single pool dynamics is dominated by delay effects, the concatenation
    of many similar systems in a tree like structure makes this an interesting and
    difficult problem, see Li et al., 2004, Li et al., 2005 for first results in the
    case of a string of identical pools. This work addresses the worst case scenario.
    What is important is to understand the average case, where there is a certain
    (natural) distribution of delays and pool dynamics. The key ingredient in understanding
    the propagation of disturbances through the system is to understand the role of
    the feed forward control in balancing the requirement for providing information
    to speed up the response, and yet limiting this information so as not to amplify
    the disturbances. Another interesting open problem that has received not enough
    attention in the control literature is to determine an appropriate structure for
    a decentralized controller. This is a problem of determining the appropriate information
    structure for control design, or which inputs/outputs are best paired with each
    other. As, the number of different decentralized controller structures is combinatorially
    large, exhaustive evaluation is simply not feasible, hence relevant heuristics
    should be developed. One ad hoc solution method, exploited in the present work,
    is to use sequential minimum variance (Weyer, 2003b), based on a particular ordering
    of the variables to be regulated. Another is to start from a global centralized
    control design, and to prune the input-output connections based on an appropriate
    singular value decomposition. In the present application, both approaches lead
    rather quickly to the proposed solution method. In sequential minimum variance,
    the ordering of the variables that leads to the above decentralized controller
    structure is to place the highest priority on the outflow , next the most down
    stream water level , then the next water level and so on. 5. Discussion Systems
    engineering principles as discussed here have been implemented in support of irrigation
    system management in a number of pilot projects in Victoria, Australia, with excellent
    outcomes in terms of achieved overall water savings and quality of service: water
    distribution efficiency of better than 90% (essentially only the unremovable losses
    due to evaporation and seepage remain), compared to 70% achieved under manual
    operations; combined with an ability to meet water requests on-demand in better
    than 90% of all water orders. All of this is achieved together with much better
    regulation accuracy, which improves the quality of service to the customers in
    a significant way. On the basis of these outcomes large scale implementation in
    Victoria has commenced. The white paper on water released by the State Government
    of Victoria identified that the implementation of advanced control, along the
    lines expounded here, will save about 400 Mm3of water per year when completed
    across all of the irrigation districts in Victoria. This volume of savings nearly
    equals the total annual water consumption for all domestic and industrial use
    in the State of Victoria. This figure is based on a conservative extrapolation
    of the actually achieved water savings in the pilot projects to date (only need
    to achieve half the success achieved in the pilot projects thus far). Similar
    studies conducted in a New South Wales report even greater saving potentials (The
    Business of Saving Water—the Report of the Murrumbidgee Valley Water Efficiency
    Project, n.d.). The economic benefits that can be derived from such water savings
    initiatives are immense. The (The Business of Saving Water—the Report of the Murrumbidgee
    Valley Water Efficiency Project, n.d.)report indicates economic benefits in the
    order of $500 M when a water saving target of 1 Gm3 would be realised. An important
    outcome of the information infrastructure is that management, and indeed the community
    at large, can be much better informed about the capabilities of the irrigation
    system; how much water was used, when and where it was used. Already, changes
    in the way irrigators use water can be observed, as a more responsive distribution
    system enables them to use more water efficient on-farm practices. This results
    in even more water savings or better economic returns for the farmers. The present
    positive results encourage the expansion of the research and development ideas
    to consider other aspects of water distribution, on-farm as well as urban. The
    outcomes realized are a small step towards the goal set forth in the UNESCO Water
    Report (2003) that fresh water management must happen on the scale of entire water
    catchments. Acknowledgements Over the last 7 years, different aspects of the work

    management system that utilizes machine learning and open-source technologies
    to optimize water resource utilization and enhance agricultural productivity.
    The system employs a predictive algorithm based on sensor data collected from
    the field and weather forecast information to predict soil moisture levels and

    resources around the globe has generated a need for their optimum utilization.
    Internet of Things (IoT) solutions, based on the application specific sensors’
    data acquisition and intelligent processing, are bridging the gaps between the
    cyber and physical worlds. IoT based smart irrigation management systems can help
    in achieving optimum water-resource utilization in the precision farming landscape.
    This paper presents an open-source technology based smart system to predict the
    irrigation requirements of a field using the sensing of ground parameter like
    soil moisture, soil temperature, and environmental conditions along with the weather
    forecast data from the Internet. The sensing nodes, involved in the ground and
    environmental sensing, consider soil moisture, soil temperature, air temperature,
    Ultraviolet (UV) light radiation, and relative humidity of the crop field. The
    intelligence of the proposed system is based on a smart algorithm, which considers
    sensed data along with the weather forecast parameters like precipitation, air
    temperature, humidity, and UV for the near future. The complete system has been
    developed and deployed on a pilot scale, where the sensor node data is wirelessly
    collected over the cloud using web-services and a web-based information visualization
    and decision support system provides the real-time information insights based
    on the analysis of sensors data and weather forecast data. The system has a provision
    for a closed-loop control of the water supply to realize a fully autonomous irrigation
    scheme. The paper describes the system and discusses in detail the information
    processing results of three weeks data based on the proposed algorithm. The system
    is fully functional and the prediction results are very encouraging. Previous

    Water scarcity is already affecting a part of the world and the situation is getting
    worse over time due to the increasing world population and fresh water demands.
    The current world population is around 7.2 billion and it is expected to be more
    than 9 billion by 2050 (United Nations, 2013). The agriculture sector, particularly
    irrigation, consumes a major portion of the freshwater. Due to lack of cost-effective
    intelligent irrigation systems, developing countries are consuming more water
    in contrast to the developed countries for achieving the same yield. For example,
    India has approximately 4% of world’s freshwater resources to serve 17% of the
    world population; however, it takes 2–4 times more water for some of its major
    agri-produce in comparison to the other countries like China, USA (G. o. I. NITI
    Aayog, 2015). Therefore, there is a dire need to come up with advanced technologies
    based smart strategies and systems for effective utilization of fresh water. Gubbi
    et al. (2013) discussed an IoT framework with cloud centric storage, processing
    and analysis of the data received from ubiquitous sensors along with a decision
    support interface. Cruz et al. (2018) suggested a reference model for an IoT middleware
    platform that would support intelligent IoT applications. IoT based solutions
    are proving very helpful in many dimensions of the agricultural landscape (Sharma
    et al., 2016), and these intelligent solutions could also be fruitful in smart
    irrigation with optimum utilization of water. Soil moisture, precipitation, and
    evaporation are the essential parameters for designing a smart irrigation system.
    The precipitation and evaporation are important key factors, which influence the
    soil moisture. In geography and climatology, the wetness of soil is estimated
    by the proportion of annual (or monthly) precipitation and evaporation (Shang
    et al., 2007). Daily soil moisture can also be evaluated by the ratio of daily
    precipitation and evaporation in the above perspective. Precipitation is directly
    accessible in the routine weather reports; nonetheless, evaporation can be calculated
    using other metrological essentials. For evaporation, we use an empirical model
    given by Penman (Chen and Chen, 1993) (1) The entire evaporation depends on the
    thermodynamic evaporation and the dynamic evaporation , where depends upon the
    velocity of the land storm, air temperature, relative humidity of the air and
    UV radiation. To achieve water saving, irrigation system frameworks have been
    proposed based on various techniques, e.g., thermal imaging, Crop Water Stress
    Index (CWSI), direct soil water measurements, etc. Thermal imaging is a prominent
    technique for irrigation management and it is based on the shade temperature distribution
    of the plant. In this framework, the status of the water in the plant is checked
    over continuous intervals and irrigation is planned in view of the shade temperature
    distribution of the plant (Wang et al., 2010). In addition, CWSI based framework
    has been proposed for irrigation scheduling of the crops for efficient use of
    water. The observation of CWSI was first characterized more than 30 years ago
    (Idso et al., 1981). O’Shaughnessy and Evett (2010) proposed an automatic irrigation
    scheduling based on direct soil water measurement that utilizes water proficiently
    over manual irrigation system. Allen et al. (1998) suggested evapotranspiration
    (ET) based approach, which is an important parameter to decide crop irrigation
    needs influenced by climate parameters, e.g., solar radiation, relative humidity,
    temperature, wind velocity, and crop features such as phase of the crop growth,
    assortment and plant density, properties of soil, nuisance, and disease control.
    ET-based frameworks can save water up to 42% over time-based water irrigation
    scheduling (Davis and Dukes, 2010). Davis et al. (2009) conducted the investigations
    in Florida and verified that ET‐based watering scheduling controllers are more
    beneficial in term of cost, size and labor requirement for irrigation. ET-based
    irrigation system uses much less water as compared to scheduled practices. Viani
    et al. (2017) proposed a fuzzy logic-based decision support system based on farmer’s
    experience with the understanding of crop condition. This system provides more
    water saving over single-threshold and multi-threshold based irrigation scheduling.
    Gutiérrez et al. (2014) proposed an automated irrigation system using a wireless
    sensor network and GPRS module to save water in irrigation. In this system, a
    network of soil moisture sensors with controller has been installed in a crop
    field for real-time monitoring and irrigation control. Gill et al. (2006) suggested
    a method for soil moisture prediction using support vector machines based on air
    temperature, relative air humidity and soil temperature. Jaguey et al. (2015)
    developed irrigation sensor based on smart phone. For sensing soil moisture, the
    digital camera of smart phone is used to process RGB to gray for estimation of
    ratio between wet and dry area of soil. The ratio of wetness and dryness is transmitted
    via gateway to water motor controller. A Mobile Application (APP) is developed
    to control sensor activity (like wakeup) and to set sensor in sleep mode. Goldstein
    et al. (2017) proposed irrigation recommendations based on machine learning algorithm
    with support of agronomist’s encysted knowledge. It was found that the best regression
    model was Gradient Boosted Regression Trees (GBRT) with 93% accuracy in prediction
    of irrigation plan/recommendation. The developed model is helpful to the agronomist’s
    irrigation management. Roopaei et al. (2017) proposed an intelligent irrigation
    monitoring system based on thermal imaging. The proposed technique uses thermal
    imaging camera mounted on Drone. An algorithm is developed using images processing
    techniques for identification of water requirement, Leaf water potential, and
    non-uniform irrigation, which are used for irrigation monitoring. Majority of
    the earlier irrigation systems do not consider the weather forecasting information
    (e.g., precipitation) while making irrigation decisions. It leads to a wastage
    of fresh water, energy and loss of crop growth (due to excess water) when a rain
    is followed immediately by the watering of the crop. To handle such cases, IoT
    based solutions can provide a better decision support for irrigation by utilizing
    weather forecasting information (e.g., precipitation) from the Internet. Further,
    the accuracy of weather forecasting is improving due to the advancement of satellite
    imagery technology. For effective and optimum utilization of fresh water in irrigation,
    it becomes essential to develop the smart irrigation systems based on dynamic
    prediction of soil moisture pattern of the field and precipitation information
    of upcoming days. This paper presents an intelligent system that predicts soil
    moisture based on the information collected from the sensors deployed at the field
    and the weather forecast information available on the Internet. The field data
    has been collected through a self-designed sensor node. The server-side software
    has been developed with node side connectivity along with information visualization
    and decision support features. A novel algorithm has been developed for soil-moisture
    prediction, which is based on Machine Learning techniques applied on the sensor
    node data and the weather forecast data. The algorithm shows improved accuracy
    and less error. The proposed approach could help in making effective irrigation
    decisions with optimum water usage. 2. Methods/Techniques used Prediction of soil
    moisture is vital for effective irrigation management system. The estimation of
    soil moisture depends upon evapotranspiration Hargreaves and Samani (1985) developed
    a method based on temperature and extra-terrestrial radiation to estimate ET0.
    It is expressed as (2) where ET0 = reference evapotranspiration (mm/day); Tmax
    and Tmin = maximum temperature and minimum temperature (°C) and Ra = extra-terrestrial
    radiation (MJ m−2 day−1). Ritchie developed another method for estimation of ET0
    (Jones and Ritchie, 1990) based on temperature and solar radiation. It is expressed
    as (3) where ET0 = reference evapotranspiration (mm/day); Tmax and Tmin = maximum
    and minimum temperature (°C) and Rs = solar radiation (MJ m−2 day−1). When (4)
    Cobaner (2011) developed evapotranspiration estimation method based on Neuro-Fuzzy
    (NF) inference and found that the NF model (based on solar radiation, air temperature,
    and relative humidity) exhibits better accuracy than the combination of solar
    radiation, air temperature and wind speed. From state of art, it has been analyzed
    that prediction of soil moisture is possible using sensors placement at the field
    and weather forecasted data. So, we have considered evaporation of soil moisture
    based on air temperature, air relative humidity, soil temperature, and radiation.
    The parameters are considered for analyzing the soil moisture drain (change/difference)
    pattern based on the recorded data of soil moisture. An IoT based architecture
    (Fig. 1) has been proposed to collect, transmit and process the physical parameters
    (soil moisture, air temperature, air relative humidity, soil temperature, and
    radiation) of farming land along with the weather forecast information to manage
    the irrigation efficiently. Download : Download high-res image (307KB) Download

    based on a combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques
    (block diagram shown in Fig. 3 and pseudocode is discussed in Section 3.2.1) has
    been developed using Support Vector Regression (SVR) and k-means clustering for
    estimation of difference/change in soil moisture due to weather conditions. It
    gives good accuracy and less Mean Squared Error (MSE) (Theobald, 1974; “Mean Squared
    Error, 2018’’) in the prediction of the soil moisture of upcoming days with the
    help of sensors data and the weather forecasting data. SVR model has been trained
    using data (air temperature, air relative humidity, soil temperature, radiation,
    and soil moisture difference) collected from field device shown in Fig. 2. The
    Soil Moisture Differences (SMD) of upcoming days have been predicted using trained
    SVR model and the predicted value of SMD is given as input for k-means clustering
    for improving the accuracy of soil moisture difference (centroid value of k-means),
    which is more accurate (Table 2) with less MSE (Table 3). The final predicted
    soil moisture (Table 4) has been used in the development of smart irrigation scheduling
    algorithm (Section 3.2.2) to efficiently utilize the natural rain (precipitation)
    information for effective irrigation. To visualize the predicted soil moisture
    of upcoming days along with precipitation information and to control (start and
    stop) the irrigation, a responsive web portal has also been developed (Fig. 4,

    Planning Module. Support Vector Regression (SVR) (Drucker et al., 1997) is the
    modified version of Support Vector Machine (SVM) (Hearst et al., 1998), where
    the dependent variable is numerical in lieu of categorical. SVR is a non-parametric
    technique and allows the creation of nonlinear models. The SVR method utilizes
    kernel functions to generate the model. Some of the frequently used kernel functions
    are Polynomial, Linear, Radial Basis and Sigmodal. k-means clustering (Kanungo
    et al., 2002) takes a straightforward and simple methodology to group a given
    information set into a definite number of clusters. The objective is to find k
    centroids, one for each bunch. First, it divides n number of the objects into
    k non-empty subgroups/cluster, and then finds the cluster centroids (mean point)
    of every subgroup/cluster. Then it calculates the distances from every point to
    the centroids and allocate each object to a specific cluster where the distance
    is minimum from the centroid. The process iterates to re-assign the points and
    identify the centroid of the new clusters. 3. The proposed system 3.1. System
    architecture The architecture of proposed IoT based smart irrigation system is
    shown in Fig. 1. It has seven main components, viz., Field data collection device
    with relay switch (Standalone and WSN Scenario); Web service for collecting field
    sensor data; Web service for collecting weather information available online (Internet);
    Web service to control water motor; Soil moisture prediction algorithm; Responsive
    web based interface for real-time monitoring; IoT enabled motor pump. These components
    are grouped into three different layers, i.e. Data collection and transmission
    layer, Data processing & intelligence layer and application layer of IoT (Fig.
    1). These components are discussed in the following sections. 3.1.1. Field data
    collection device Depending on the field requirements, a standalone sensor node
    or a wireless sensor network of the sensor nodes may be deployed. In standalone
    scenario field data collection device consists of four sensors, viz., VH-400 Soil
    Moisture sensor, Soil temperature sensor, DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor,
    and Ultraviolet (UV) Light Radiation sensor based on GUVA-S12SD and SGM8521 Op
    Amp. The output of these sensors is read by an Arduino-Uno, which is connected
    to Raspberry Pi (R-Pi). In R-Pi a program is written in Python language to hourly
    fetch the data from sensors and to store the data in SQLite database, which is
    synched with the server database using developed web service. For large farming
    area, a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) (Ojha et al., 2015) scenario with ZigBee
    (Pandey et al., 2017, Gutiérrez et al., 2014) technology can be implemented in
    which multiple sensor nodes can be planted in the specified area. Each sensor
    node will consist of the sensors similar to the standalone device. The output
    of these sensors is read by an Arduino-Uno connected to ZigBee for sending data
    to Gateway Node (similar to the standalone device with ZigBee connectivity) that
    will aggregate the received data and store it locally in SQLite and also send
    the data to the server using web service. The current analysis (statistical analysis
    of predicted soil moisture and its accuracy is exhibited in Fig. 6, Table 3, Table
    5) has been done with the standalone device. The standalone device is shown in
    Fig. 2. Table 5. Comparison of correlation, R squared and MSE between soil moisture
    values based on the sensor data and the proposed algorithm. Parameter Predicted

    Fig. 6. Graphical representation of the results shown in Table 2. 3.1.2. Web service
    for field sensor data collection The Web service is written in PHP with a light
    weighted REST API to communicate the data between the field device and the server.
    The service is hosted on Apache (Web server) at server machine. The R-Pi sends
    the field data to the server using this web service. This web service can handle
    the network fluctuation/outage during synchronizing the data from the filed device
    to the server with the help of flag settings at the database level. 3.1.3. Web
    service for online weather data collection A web service has been developed in
    Python to collect the weather forecasting data. This web service also aggregates
    the weather forecasting data like temperature, humidity, cloudiness, UV Index
    and precipitation of different web forecasting portal like OpenWeather and AccuWeather
    using API of these portal (Weather API, 2012, API Reference, 2017). These portals
    provide the forecasted information in JSON, XML, or HTML format. The developed
    web service read the forecasted data (JSON format) of the specified location using
    API and store it in MySQL database at the server, which is considered in the prediction
    algorithm. 3.1.4. Soil moisture prediction algorithm An algorithm has been developed
    (Fig. 3) to predict the soil moisture based on field sensors data and weather
    forecasting data using support vector regression model and k-means clustering
    algorithm. The algorithm shows information regarding soil moisture of the upcoming
    days. It also provides irrigation suggestions, based on the defined level of soil
    moisture and predicted precipitation, to save water and energy. The generated
    information by algorithm and device is stored in MySQL Database at the server.
    The algorithm is discussed in detail in Section 3.2. 3.1.5. Responsive web based
    interface for real-time monitoring A responsive web based user interface is developed
    using PHP, MySQL and Bootstrap API for real-time monitoring and scheduling of
    irrigation activities (Fig. 4, Fig. 5). The interface visualizes real-time sensors
    data, predicted soil moisture of upcoming days, and precipitation information.
    Further, it also provides a facility for irrigation scheduling. The user can schedule
    the irrigation at a specified threshold value of soil moisture. The system guides
    to maintain the threshold value based on the predicted pattern of soil moisture
    and precipitation information. The system can automatically start the irrigation,
    which stops after achieving the specified threshold value of soil moisture. 3.1.6.
    Web service to control water motor A web service has been developed on top of
    HTTP protocol to start and stop the water motor. This web service has been accessed
    by Python code in R-Pi to start and stop the water motor. The Python code (running
    on R-Pi) send signal to Arduino-Uno that controls the relay switch to start/stop
    the water motor. 3.1.7. IoT enabled water pump In this module, a water pump is
    connected to a relay switch that is controlled by a Wi-Fi enabled node. The node
    is controlled by the web service through a trigger from the responsive web based
    interface for real-time monitoring. Using this web based interface the water pump
    can be managed remotely in manual and auto modes. 3.1.8. Communication technologies
    used in proposed architecture In the proposed architecture, the WiFi module/Mobile
    data communication module can be used as communication media between the field
    device and the server. In this experiment (Standalone device scenario), a WiFi
    module has been used to send the data to the server. In WSN scenario, ZigBee network
    can be used between sensor node to Gateway Node and then a WiFi module or Mobile
    data communication module can be used to send the data from the gateway node to
    the server. 3.2. Prediction algorithm and data visualization Flow diagram of the
    proposed soil moisture prediction algorithm and the irrigation planning algorithm
    for data visualization and decision support is shown in Fig. 3. 3.2.1. Algorithm

    scheduling Algorithm Steps Step 1. Initialize minimum threshold (THmin) of soil
    moisture to start irrigation and maximum threshold (THmax) of soil moisture to
    stop irrigation Step2. Set mode (manual/auto) for irrigation Step 3. If (mode = auto)  {   Read
    and check current soil moisture (Csm)   If (Csm <= THmin) // condition check of
    current soil moisture from its set threshold value by user   {    Ndate = Read
    precipitation information of upcoming days and select nearest date of precipitation.    Calculate
    required soil moisture (Rsm) = sum (predicted SMD from current date to nearest
    date of precipitation (Ndate)) //Total change in soil moisture till nearest precipitation
    date    Set THmax = minimum ((THmin + Rsm), THmax) // selection of minimum soil-
    moisture required to maintain crop growth    while (THmax > Csm) // condition

    1 to relay to start irrigation //Signal to start the water motor     }    }    Else    {     Send
    0 to stop irrigation //Signal to stop the water motor    }  } 3.2.3. Experimental
    setup The main objective of this experiment is to collect the physical parameters
    of a farming land using sensors and to utilize these sensors’ data along with
    weather forecast information for developing an algorithm for prediction of soil
    moisture of the upcoming days. The algorithm uses a hybrid machine learning approach,
    as discussed in Section 3.2, to achieve higher accuracy in soil moisture prediction.
    It provides a probable estimate of soil moisture to plan and provision the optimum
    irrigation. Statistical measures, R squared (Table 5) and Mean Squared Error (Table
    3, Table 5), are used for estimation of accuracy and error rate of the proposed
    algorithm. The experiment shows that a good estimation (close to the actual value)
    of the soil moisture (Table 4), with the help of field data and forecasted information,
    can be utilized for optimum irrigation with an effective utilization of natural
    rain. As described in Section 3.1, one field data collection device (node) has
    been deployed in the garden of our organization to collect the field data (Fig.
    2). The data is collected at the server using the web services. Then, the data
    is analyzed using the proposed machine learning approach (Section 3.2.1). Further,
    a responsive web based interface has been developed for real-time monitoring,
    data visualization and decision support system, and for the scheduling of irrigation.
    Fig. 4 shows the GUI of responsive web based interface for real-time monitoring
    and decision support system, which shows the current soil moisture recorded by
    the sensor, and the predicted soil moisture generated by the algorithm. This information,
    predicted soil moisture and precipitation information, will help user/farmer in
    planning/scheduling of optimum irrigation. Fig. 5 shows the GUI of irrigation
    planning module to schedule the irrigation by setting Irrigation Date, and Threshold
    Levels for Soil Moisture. It works in two modes, viz., auto, and manual, as discussed
    in Section 3.2.2. In manual mode, the user takes the scheduling decision based
    on predicted soil moisture and precipitation information. In auto mode, user sets
    the Soil Moisture Threshold levels, and the system automatically schedules the
    irrigation date based on the predicted soil moisture and weather forecast (precipitation)
    information. For example, if rain is expected on the scheduled irrigation date
    or near to scheduled date, then the system will wait for the rain and it will
    suspend the artificial/manual irrigation or it will start watering (if needed,
    based on the algorithm) the field to maintain minimum soil moisture till the arrival
    of rain. Further, the system can handle the changes in forecasted precipitation
    values. 4. Results and discussion The smartness of the proposed system is dependent
    on the accuracy of the predicted soil moisture (Table 4, Table 5). To verify the
    accuracy of soil moisture prediction algorithm, the hourly field data for air
    temperature, air humidity, soil moisture, soil temperature, and UV is collected
    for three weeks. The three weeks’ hourly data has been averaged out on per day
    basis and the 21 days’ data is divided into a training set (70% of the data) and
    testing set (30% of the data) for applying the proposed algorithm. Initially,
    we have predicted SMD of upcoming days using the proposed algorithm (Fig. 3) and
    the predicted values of SMD has been used in prediction of soil moisture of upcoming
    days. The results are summarized in Table 2, Table 3, Table 4, Table 5. The SVR + k-means
    approach has higher accuracy with lower mean squared error over SVR approach while
    calculating SMD (Table 2 and Table 3). The graph (Fig. 6) shows that predicted
    SMD using proposed algorithm (SVR + k-means) is nearer to actual SMD as compared
    to predicted SMD using SVR only. The SVR + k-means approach has the same accuracy
    with the lower mean squared error over SVR approach in soil moisture prediction
    (Tables 4 and 5). The predicted soil moisture shown in Table 4 has been calculated
    based on soil moisture and SMD of previous day, e.g. soil moisture on 14-11-2017
    is 26.8982 then the soil moisture of the next day (15-11-2017) will be equal to
    the difference of soil moisture on the previous day (i.e., 14–11-2017) and SMD
    difference predicted for 15-11-2017 (Table 2). From the Tables 2 and 3, we have
    observed that the prediction of SMD using SVR + k-means approach gives higher
    accuracy with less MSE as compared to SVR approach, and we have also observed
    the same accuracy (R squared = 96%) with lesser MSE in prediction of soil moisture
    using combined approach (SVR + k-means) (Table 5). It shows that the proposed
    algorithm (based on SVR + k-means) is better as compared to SVR based approach.
    Due to higher accuracy and minimum MSE, SVR + k-means based hybrid machine learning
    algorithm has been used in irrigation planning module. 5. Conclusion The soil
    moisture is a critical parameter for developing a smart irrigation system. The
    soil moisture is affected by a number of environmental variables, e.g., air temperature,
    air humidity, UV, soil temperature, etc. With advancement in technologies, the
    weather forecasting accuracy has improved significantly and the weather forecasted
    data can be used for prediction of changes in the soil moisture. This paper proposes
    an IoT based smart irrigation architecture along with a hybrid machine learning
    based approach to predict the soil moisture. The proposed algorithm uses sensors’
    data of recent past and the weather forecasted data for prediction of soil moisture
    of upcoming days. The predicted value of the soil moisture is better in terms
    of their accuracy and error rate. Further, the prediction approach is integrated
    into a standalone system prototype. The system prototype is cost effective, as
    it is based on the open standard technologies. The auto mode makes it a smart
    system and it can be further customized for application specific scenarios. In
    future, we are planning to conduct a water saving analysis based on proposed algorithm
    with multiple nodes along with minimizing the system cost. Acknowledgements Authors

  explanation: 'This review paper explores the use of model predictive control (MPC)
    in a variety of agricultural applications. It highlights the advantages of MPC,
    such as its ability to account for physical constraints, its robustness to disturbances,
    and its ability to optimize performance over a finite horizon. The paper also
    discusses the challenges of implementing MPC in real-world agricultural systems,
    such as the need for accurate models and the computational complexity of the algorithms.
    However, with the increasing availability of low-cost sensing and computing, MPC
    is becoming more accessible for agricultural producers.


    The paper''s relevance to the specific point you are making (exploring the concept
    of closed-loop control in autonomous irrigation systems) is that it provides a
    comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art in MPC for agricultural applications,
    including irrigation systems. The paper discusses the different types of MPC algorithms,
    their advantages and disadvantages, and their potential applications in agriculture.
    It also provides several examples of successful MPC implementations in irrigation
    systems. This information can help you to understand the potential of MPC for
    closed-loop control in autonomous irrigation systems and to identify the best
    MPC algorithm for your specific application.'
  extract_1: Model predictive control (MPC) is a powerful control technique that has
    been widely used in a variety of industrial applications. In recent years, there
    has been increasing interest in applying MPC to agricultural systems, including
    irrigation systems. MPC is well-suited for irrigation systems because it can account
    for the physical constraints of the system, such as the maximum flow rate of the
    water supply and the minimum and maximum water levels in the reservoirs. MPC can
    also be used to optimize the performance of the irrigation system, such as by
    minimizing the amount of water used or by maximizing the crop yield.
  extract_2: There are a number of different MPC algorithms that can be used for irrigation
    systems. The most common type of MPC algorithm is the linear quadratic regulator
    (LQR). LQR is a relatively simple algorithm that is easy to implement. However,
    LQR can only be used for linear systems. For nonlinear systems, such as irrigation
    systems, more complex MPC algorithms, such as nonlinear model predictive control
    (NMPC), must be used.

    plays a decisive role in the survival of humankind. The efficient and precise
    regulation of agriculture will ensure the welfare of people throughout the world.
    However, difficult and urgent agricultural challenges persist, and traditional
    agricultural production regulation methods are time consuming and laborious. Moreover,
    the application of intelligent algorithms to modern agricultural production requires
    the support of a database, which can be complex and difficult to use in practice
    and requires a large amount of computing. Fortunately, model predictive control
    (MPC) methods can achieve highly accurate control operations with moderate complexity
    and can also allow for rolling optimization in a limited time domain, which improves
    precision. Despite being a process control method that originated in industry,
    MPC is highly suited for application in agriculture because it can effectively
    address nonlinear and large time-delay systems. The aim of this review is to introduce
    MPC and describe its current application in agriculture. In this review, the development
    of MPC and various improved MPC schemes are described. The development of MPC
    is divided into three stages. In addition, applications and new technologies associated
    with MPC in irrigation systems, agricultural machinery, agricultural production,
    product processing and greenhouses are analyzed. Smart agriculture will have a
    promising future because of the implementation of MPC technologies derived from
    successful industrial applications. Finally, challenges and future perspectives
    of MPC technology use in agriculture are summarized and forecasted. Previous article

    1. Introduction Agriculture is the foundation of human existence, it is vital
    to the survival of humankind. Today, the total global population exceeds 7 billion,
    and by 2050, the urban population will increase by an additional 2.5 billion through
    population growth and urbanization, with nearly 90% of the population concentrated
    in Asia and Africa (Lloyd et al., 2017). However, the amount of available food
    is limited, especially in Africa, and the food scarcity problem has yet to be
    solved (Sanchez, 2002); additionally, Asia has a serious shortage of water (Pomeranz,
    2009). The earth''s water supply is rich, with 1.45 billion cubic kilometers in
    total, and 72% of the Earth’s surface area is covered with water. However, less
    than 1% of the world’s fresh water is easy to exploit for direct human use, accounting
    for approximately 0.007% of the total water on the planet. The total land area
    of the world exceeds 13 billion hectares; however, the area of potentially arable
    land throughout the world accounts for 22% of the total land area, at just 3031
    million hectares (Lal, 1990). Moreover, traditional agriculture is time-consuming
    and labor-intensive, with low production efficiency. Considering the increasing
    population, water shortages, limited land resources, and low production efficiency,
    it is urgent to efficiently regulate agriculture. Agricultural systems are complex,
    multivariate and unpredictable (Kamilaris et al., 2018). Classical control technologies
    such as those involving on/off, P, proportional integral (PI), and proportion-integration-differentiation
    (PID) control (Christofides et al., 2013, Afram and Janabi-Sharifi, 2014) are
    easy to implement but are unable to control moving processes with time delays;
    in addition, adjusting the controller is cumbersome and time consuming (Wang et
    al., 2001). Intelligent methods such as fuzzy logic (FL) control and artificial
    neural network (ANN) control involve not only deterministic mathematical models
    but also nonmathematical generalized models and mixed models (Afram and Janabi-Sharifi,
    2014). However, these methods require learning and reasoning based on data-driven
    or embedded expert knowledge. Fortunately, the performance of MPC is superior
    to that of classical control and is easier to implement than intelligent computing
    algorithms. MPC can achieve high regulation accuracy with moderate complexity.
    Therefore, this method is highly suited for precision agricultural production.
    MPC refers to a class of advanced computer-controlled algorithms that use an explicit
    process model to predict a plant''s future response (Qin and Badgwell, 2003).
    A series of control inputs are computed at each sampling instant, but only the
    first computed input is implemented in the process (Bumroongsri and Kheawhom,
    2014). The first input in the optimal sequence is then sent to the factory, and
    the entire calculation is repeated at subsequent control intervals (Mogal and
    Warke, 2013). The algorithm consists of three parts: prediction model, rolling
    optimization, and feedback adjustment (Zhang, et al., 2017a, Zhang et al., 2017b,
    Zhang et al., 2017c). MPC was developed in the early 1960s and has been used widely
    in process industries (Garriga and Soroush, 2010). The method allows for the introduction
    of constraints, predictive information, and nonlinear dynamics. Linear MPC (LMPC)
    is used to solve convex quadratic programming problems (QPs) online. Nonlinear
    MPC (NMPC) allows for the control of systems with nonlinear dynamics and involves
    significantly more calculation than does LMPC (Vukov et al., 2015). Early MPC
    theory incorporated dynamic matrix control (DMC) and model algorithm control (MAC),
    which are based on the linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG), which is a relatively
    simple parameter model. Internal model control (IMC) is defined for single-input/single-output,
    discrete-time systems (Garcia and Morari, 1982). DMC and MAC inspired the development
    of IMC but lacked stability. Thus, the generalized predictive control (GPC) model
    was developed; its theoretical basis is more complete than DMC and MAC, and it
    could also solve the robustness problem to a certain extent. Most industrial processes
    are highly complex, involve large amounts of interference and are strongly nonlinear;
    thus, adaptive MPC, robust MPC and NMPC have been developed. However, the calculation
    time for these MPCs is quite long and inefficient. To solve these problems, the
    distributed MPC, hybrid MPC, explicit MPC and other new MPC models were established
    (Lee, 2011). In addition, because actual production processes are random, stochastic
    MPCs have also been developed (Zhang, et al., 2017a, Zhang et al., 2017b, Zhang
    et al., 2017c). As one of the most promising control strategies, MPC has been
    widely studied (Froisy, 1994, Morari and Lee, 1999, Qin and Badgwell, 2003, Rawlings
    and Mayne, 2009) and applied in industry (Qin, 1997, Seki et al., 2001, Han and
    Qiao, 2014). The application of MPC to agriculture can yield significant productivity
    and efficiency benefits. However, no review of MPC use in agricultural applications
    has been reported. MPC has been applied to agriculture, but it has not yet been
    applied in all respects. In this review, MPC development and current application
    in agriculture are described. The development of MPC can be divided into three
    stages: classical MPC, improved MPC, and the latest MPC. These MPCs are described
    in Chapter 2. Currently, MPC is used mainly in agricultural applications such
    as irrigation systems, machinery, production, product processing, and greenhouses.
    These applications are described in Chapter 3. The challenges and future perspectives
    of MPC are discussed in Chapter 4. Finally, conclusions are discussed. 2. The
    development of MPC In the 1960s and 1970s, the concept of MPC appeared in the
    literature. However, MPC was not introduced into process industries until the
    1980s (Froisy, 1994). In general, the evolution of this scheme can be divided
    into three stages according to the degree of technological development. The theoretical
    principle of MPC is shown in Fig. 1. The input is , the initial output is , the
    output after optimization is , and the output after on-line correction is ; after
    a number of repeated cycles, the final output is y(k). Download : Download high-res

    other algorithms established during this period are shown in Table 1. Table 1.

    matrix control and model algorithm control Early MPCs, such as LQG controllers
    (Kalman, 1960), were unable to handle constraints, process nonlinearity or uncertainty.
    Later, DMC and MAC systematically introduced input and output constraints to address
    some of the drawbacks of LQG (Garriga and Soroush, 2010). DMC is a significant
    and classical predictive control method first proposed by Culter and Ramakar (Cutler
    and Ramakar, 1980). This method uses a step-response model (SRM) that is relatively
    easy to develop in practice (Moon and Lee, 2011). Studies have shown that DMC
    could sometimes be combined with PID to improve the performance of DMC (Guo et
    al., 2010, Wu et al., 2014). In addition, nonlinear systems with high efficiency
    are consistently described by many SRMs (Moon and Lee, 2011). Quadratic dynamic
    matrix control (QDMC) is also commonly used. This algorithm can reduce the cost
    of a given system (Li et al., 2012). Richalet et al. established the original
    concept of MAC in the late 1970s (Richalet et al., 1978a, Richalet et al., 1978b).
    MAC essentially involves an impulse response model, a reference trajectory, an
    optimality criterion and state and control constraints (Xia et al., 1993). The
    purpose of MAC is to obtain an optimal control strategy for minimizing the relevant
    criterion, which reflects future deviations within a certain range (Zhang et al.,
    2009). The combination of MAC with PID can also improve the performance of MAC
    (Wei, 2015). Regardless of model structure and order, the DMC and MAC schemes
    include fixed time-delay terms. The disadvantage is that these methods cannot
    describe unstable systems, are not applicable to unstable objects, and cannot
    easily perform online model identification. 2.1.2. Generalized predictive control
    The GPC model was first developed in 1987 by Clarke et al., 1987a, Clarke, et
    al., 1987b. The principle of GPC is to generate a series of control signals at
    each sample interval to optimize the control effort to track the reference trajectory
    accurately (Lu and Tsai, 2009). The core idea is to develop a control strategy
    that can adapt to dynamic changes in the sampling rate. (Pawlowski et al., 2012a,
    Pawlowski et al., 2012b). The purpose of GPC is to replace the self-regulating
    regulator to solve robustness problems (Lee, 2011). GPC can be used with the CARIMA
    model to improve performance (Kiselev et al., 2016, Wang et al., 2016). Predictive
    control (PC) can control simple to highly complex processes, including those involving
    large time delays, nonminimal phases, unstable and multivariable systems (Aguilar
    et al., 2016). GPC has the advantages of both self-tuning control and PC, and
    feedback correction is implemented in a self-tuning manner through online model
    identification and online control law correction. GPC can control open-loop instability,
    nonminimum phases, and time-varying delay objects and exhibits good robustness
    to time-delay and order-indeterminate systems. However, GPC is difficult to be
    deploy in multivariable systems. In addition, different companies using early
    MPC technologies have had unique sets of problems to address. Some technologies
    have become known by their commercial software product names, which are still
    used today. In general, these technologies are also known as MPCs and are briefly
    described in Table 1. 2.2. Improved MPC The classical MPC schemes cannot meet
    complex industrial requirements. The purpose of the next generation of MPC, referred
    to as improved MPC, was to address the robustness and nonlinearity of control
    problems. 2.2.1. Adaptive MPC Generally, control problems involve many unmeasurable
    parameters and uncertainties, which, to some extent, decrease the performance
    of MPC. One solution is to update the model parameters offline through state measurements.
    However, adaptive extensions of MPC with online parameter estimation and control
    are more attractive (Adetola et al., 2009). Therefore, adaptive MPC was developed,
    which considers constraints of the process input, output and state variables (Sadjadi
    and Mohammad, 2013, Adetola and Guay, 2011). In addition, in adaptive MPC, the
    computation time of the NMPC model is less than that of the GPC model (Akpan and
    Hassapis, 2011). Although some adaptive MPC methods have been applied to linear
    systems, few adaptive MPC methods have been developed for nonlinear systems (Adetola
    et al., 2009). In addition, it is difficult to guarantee the implementation of
    constraints under an adaptive mechanism. Moreover, when using adaptive MPC, it
    may be very difficult to theoretically guarantee stability and feasibility (Fukushima
    et al., 2007). 2.2.2. Robust MPC Although MPC has some inherent robustness as
    a feedback control method, it is still not sufficiently robust to address complex
    industrial processes. The min-max MPC formulation is important for incorporating
    the concepts of robust control into MPC (Lee, 2014). The purpose of robust control
    is to design controllers that maintain stability and performance despite model
    inaccuracies or uncertainties (Camacho and Berenguel, 2015). Robust MPC integrated
    with a neural network was able to address a min-max optimization problem (Pan
    and Wang, 2008, Yan and Wang, 2011). Adding an integral action to robust MPC (RMPC + I)
    provided good robustness and good steady-state characteristics (Akçakaya and Sümer,
    2009). For large-scale systems, a robust distributed MPC with time delays could
    minimize the upper limit of a robust performance target (Zhang et al., 2014).
    This approach could maintain robust stability by simplifying goals and uncertainty
    descriptions to solve problems and make online work easy to manage. However, actual
    production applications are much more complex. Robust MPC has been widely researched
    theoretically, but most results are not applicable to hardware implementation;
    the controllers are simply conceptual. Thus, further study of robust MPC is crucial,
    and an improved MPC scheme with greater robustness is needed. 2.2.3. Nonlinear
    MPC Indeed, most industrial processes are not as simple as they are described
    in theory; they are nonlinear with large delays and strong perturbations. NMPC
    is required to operate under these conditions. Froisy proposed that second-order
    Volterra models could bridge the gap between linear empirical models and nonlinear
    basic models (Froisy, 1994). Although NMPC can address multiple-input/multiple-output
    (MIMO) systems and constraints, it is not as widely used in industry as linear
    MPC, mainly because the calculation time required for convergence is not negligible
    (Wolf and Marquardt, 2016). To achieve real-time NMPC, Houska et al. presented
    an automatic C-code generation strategy (Houska et al., 2011). The inherent nonconvexity
    makes it very expensive for NMPC to settle to global optimality. Harinath et al.
    introduced a scheme that described nonlinear dynamical systems and constraints
    through polynomial functions (Harinath et al., 2016). For nonlinear systems with
    large delays and strong perturbations, NMPC is a better choice. However, its calculation
    time is too long, and it is more expensive than MPC. Future research on NMPC should
    address the method’s limitations and broaden its application. Unlike classical
    models, the new generation of MPC schemes has incorporated software that uses
    more standard state space models and related tools, such as the Kalman filter.
    The stability of the mathematical properties of these schemes has been successfully
    established. 2.3. Latest MPC With continuously increasing performance and computing
    time requirements, more advanced MPCs have been developed. The purpose of this
    latest generation of MPC is to decrease calculation times (Lee, 2011). 2.3.1.
    Hybrid MPC, tube-based MPC, stochastic MPC In the 1990s, researchers began to
    solve the problem of controlling hybrid systems involving continuous and discrete
    dynamics (Ghasemi and Afzalian, 2017). Hybrid MPC is a system with logical rules
    and continuous dynamical and logical rules. Bemporad et al. extended MPC to hybrid
    systems based on the mixed logical dynamical (MLD) modeling framework (Bemporad
    and Morari, 1999). In addition, the solution of hybrid MPC can be rewritten as
    a series of optimization problems, a method known as mixed integer quadratic programming
    (MIQP), but the computation is complex. However, transforming the MIQP into an
    easier quadratic program (QP) could save significant computation time (Mendes
    et al., 2017). In plant operation, hybrid MPC systems can increase profits (Singh
    et al., 2015). There are many ways to obtain parallelism for a hybrid MPC, yet
    it is unclear what method should be used to achieve the highest possible performance.
    Tube-based MPC and stochastic MPC have also drawn much attention. The purpose
    of tube-based MPC is to preserve all possible trajectories of uncertain systems
    within a tube, the center of which is obtained by solving the nominal system with
    more restrictive, conventional MPC. The size of the tube is limited by the local
    controller, which tries to redirect all trajectories of the uncertain system to
    the center track (Ghasemi and Afzalian, 2017). Tube-based MPC is always combined
    with other methods, such as robust tube-based MPC (Limon et al., 2010, Ghasemi
    and Afzalian, 2017) and explicit tube-based MPC (Bayer et al., 2016). Tube-based
    MPC can improve the robustness of a control system to a certain extent. However,
    this method weakens the consideration of system disturbances. Modeling and measurements
    always involve many random uncertainties. Some scholars (Kouvaritakis et al.,
    2010, Cannon et al., 2011) have put forward stochastic MPC (SMPC) strategies,
    which explicitly use probabilistic information about additive disturbances to
    minimize the expected value of a predicted cost subject to hard and soft constraints
    (Cannon et al., 2012). These methods consider the stochastic features of the uncertainties,
    allow for the frequency of constraint violations to be lower than an expected
    threshold (Dai et al., 2016) and aim to solve stochastic disturbances and model
    uncertainties of systems through statistics by describing the stochastic characteristics
    of uncertainty. Cannon et al. found that using stochastic tube MPC could achieve
    nearly the best performance under soft constraint conditions (Cannon et al., 2012).
    The basic feature of many SMPC methods is the characterization of noise properties,
    which is a critical point that can lead to problems with reliability and robustness
    under nonideal conditions. In some simulation studies, the potential of SMPC in
    many areas has been explored, but its use in practice is limited. 2.3.2. Distributed
    MPC MPC is generally achieved in a centralized manner; however, in large-scale
    systems, distributed MPC (DMPC) is more useful (Pannocchia, 2015). DMPC can address
    the action of other agents with respect to their future intention and while making
    decisions about the agent’s own control actions (Alrifaee et al., 2016). This
    strategy can also prevent loss of information, reduce calculation time, and address
    interferences. Decentralized and hierarchical structures have been developed and
    applied. The differences between these four structures are shown in Fig. 3. Download

    and d. hierarchical MPC. The DMPC method is among the superior technologies used
    to address complex control problems, and many subsystems are interconnected. This
    method allows for the allocation of decisions under system constraints. In addition,
    because information is communicated between intelligent agents, the performance
    of the distributed MPC scheme is better than that of conventional decentralized
    MPC. For example, buildings consist of many connected compartments, which requires
    the use of DMPC (Barata et al., 2014). DMPC can also be used to handle the disturbances
    in railway networks (Kersbergen et al., 2016) and for the optimal operation of
    a smart grid distributed energy system (Stadler et al., 2016) and other systems
    that require exchange of information between different MPC subsystems. Future
    research should focus on the robustness of model uncertainties and time delays.
    We should also develop MPC strategies with shorter computing times and higher
    robustness and, at the same time, expand their application areas beyond the industrial
    sector to agriculture. 2.3.3. Explicit MPC Explicit MPC uses table lookup to replace
    online optimization and reduces the MPC calculation time directly. By employing
    multiparameter quadratic programming, repetitive computation can be completed
    offline, which largely reduces the online calculation time (Alessio and Bemporad,
    2009). In general, low precision operations are the first choice to reduce costs,
    accelerate execution or reduce power consumption. However, constraint satisfaction
    cannot be guaranteed in low-precision operations. Suardi et al. designed an explicit
    MPC scheme to guarantee hard constraints with limited precision (Suardi et al.,
    2016). However, explicit MPC strategies are only suitable for small-scale optimization
    problems. The demands for high speed and real-time execution in complex, large-scale
    control systems are not always satisfied. In the future, semi-explicit methods
    (Goebel and Allgöwer, 2017) should also be studied to preprocess MPC optimization
    problems offline as much as possible. Over approximately 40 years of development,
    MPC has been able to solve multivariable constraints, robustness problems, and
    nonlinear problems and reduce computation times. In general, with a good theoretical
    basis and a proven ability to handle many industrial control problems, MPC is
    now considered an extremely powerful method. Moreover, the extension of the application
    of MPC schemes represents an important research field. The history of MPC development
    is briefly summarized in Fig. 4. Download : Download high-res image (339KB) Download

    of MPC in agriculture Agricultural production objects and industrial control objects
    have many similarities, such as a large time delay, nonlinearity, and constraints.
    This chapter summarizes the current application of MPC in agriculture, such as
    in irrigation systems, agricultural machinery, agricultural production, product
    processing, and greenhouses. 3.1. Irrigation systems It is essential for plants
    to receive efficient and timely irrigation during growth. Currently, widely used
    control algorithms in irrigation systems involve PID control, robust control,
    optimal control, predictive control, and nonlinear control (Salahou, 2013). However,
    both PID control and robust control rely heavily on an exact description of the
    control pair, and an irrigation canal involves nonlinearity, a large time delay,
    and perturbation. Thus, it is very difficult to create exact models. Artificial
    intelligence control schemes such as MPC can avoid complicated mathematical modeling
    to some extent and can solve the nonlinear models and random disturbances associated
    with canals (Wu et al., 2008). Thus, MPC appears to be a promising irrigation
    control tool (Delgoda et al., 2016) whose purpose is to control the water level
    or flow by controlling locks, gates, and pumps. Therefore, the following section
    analyzes and explains the application of MPC in irrigation according to different
    controlled variables. 3.1.1. Flow regulation Puig et al. presented a method based
    on MPC for the optimal management of a combined irrigation and water supply system
    and proved the effectiveness of MPC (Puig et al., 2012). With respect to cotton
    irrigation feedback control, McCarthy et al. used a model-based irrigation strategy
    that generated a higher simulated yield and water efficiency (McCarthy et al.,
    2014). Aguilar et al. demonstrated that the performance of predictive control
    is superior to that of a harmonic proportional, integral and derivative controller
    in terms of the automatic management of water demand emissions (Aguilar et al.,
    2016). In addition, a hierarchical controller can be used to preserve a distillate
    volume for greenhouse irrigation (Roca et al., 2016). For large irrigation systems,
    a distributed MPC scheme is more suitable because it can save computing time.
    Negenborn et al. proposed a serial, iteration-based distributed MPC scheme (Negenborn
    et al., 2009a, Negenborn et al., 2009b) and a noniterative cascaded predictive
    control method to control irrigation canals. The authors found that the noniterative
    method performed better than the iterative method when the number of iterations
    was less than 30 (Negenborn et al., 2009a, Negenborn et al., 2009b). Although
    the amount of information associated with the iterative algorithms was higher
    than that associated with noniterative algorithms (Scattolini, 2009), a significant
    amount of time was required to complete the necessary number of iterations. 3.1.2.
    Water level regulation Zhang et al. proposed a noncooperative distributed MPC
    (NDMPC) method based on Nash optimality to devise a controller for setting point
    regulation and found this method to be efficient (Zhang et al., 2015). However,
    communication constraints and large disturbances from the environment should be
    considered in the future. For set points, a dynamic target trajectory method can
    calculate changes in the control targets used by MPC. This scheme is more robust
    and stable for controlling all water levels within the established bounds (Xu,
    2016). Sutrisno et al. proposed a weighting scheme in which each weighted value
    is proportional to the volume of the subsystem of the designed controller. The
    results show that the cost of Nash-bargaining MPC (NB-MPC) using the aforementioned
    weighting scheme is lowest (Sutrisno et al., 2012). Farhadi et al. proposed a
    distributed MPC scheme with a two-level architecture; results show that the secondary
    distribution MPC method exhibits high performance. The problem of identifying
    disjointed neighborhoods for a distributed system with arbitrary topology should
    be solved in the future (Farhadi and Khodabandehlou, 2016). Figueiredo et al.
    applied MPC to an automatic water canal managed by a supervisory control and data
    acquisition (SCADA) system (Figueiredo et al., 2013). Horváth et al. found that
    the gate may be better than the discharge for this canal because the method is
    able to consider the interaction between channel pools and better solve the steady-state
    offset (Horváth et al., 2014). For a steady-state offset, Horváth et al. developed
    and implemented an additional component, which was applied to MPC to eliminate
    the offset of a predictive controller for the water level. The method was shown
    to be effective (Horváth et al., 2015). Further studies are needed to confirm
    the performance of this method in other situations. 3.1.3. Flow and water level
    regulation Lemos et al. estimated the performance of adaptive and nonadaptive
    MPC using a pilot irrigation channel (Lemos et al., 2009). Kearney et al. developed
    a noniterative distributed MPC scheme that incorporates the concept of spare supply
    capacity (Kearney et al., 2011a, Kearney et al., 2011b). This method is more efficient
    than a centralized MPC method. Future studies could improve the spare supply capacity
    approximation and modify the proposed DMPC formulation to attain recursive feasibility.
    Álvarez et al. proposed cooperative distributed MPC. The results show that this
    controller is better than conventional decentralized MPC because of savings on
    resources and cost. More complex algorithms must be tested in actual irrigation
    systems (Álvarez et al., 2013). Regarding hierarchical methods, Fele et al. proposed
    a hierarchical distributed control scheme. The lower layer is controlled by a
    closed-loop MPC scheme (Fele et al., 2013). The authors also proposed a hierarchical
    control scheme. The bottom layer used a decentralized MPC scheme (Fele et al.,
    2014). In addition, Li developed a two-level hierarchical control whose higher
    level involves MPC (Li, 2014). From a risk perspective, Zafra-Cabeza et al. proposed
    a hierarchical distributed MPC (HDMPC) scheme. In the lower layer, the distributed
    MPC manipulates the flow and doors to reach the water level required for the top
    layer (Zafra-Cabeza et al., 2011a, Zafra-Cabeza, et al., 2011b). Sadowska et al.
    developed a hierarchical, event-driven controller with a coordinator that could
    modify set points (Sadowska et al., 2014a, Sadowska et al., 2014b). The authors
    also found that the performance of event-driven control was better than that of
    time-driven control (Sadowska et al., 2015, Sadowska, et al., 2015). The authors
    plan to examine real irrigation channels in future studies. A canal cannot effectively
    deliver water under severe inflow fluctuations (Han and Qiao, 2014). Researchers
    found that combining MPC with online water storage could compensate for an existing
    flow delay time and avoid large waves to improve performance (Hashemy et al.,
    2013, Shahdany et al., 2016). Others combined MPC and local operations with human
    involvement to produce mobile MPC (MoMPC) (Maestre et al., 2014). This method
    is more practical and better than either fully manual or fully automatic operations
    (Sadowska et al., 2015, Sadowska, et al., 2015). Kearney et al. presented an MPC
    scheme featuring a predetermined load to consider the constraints applied to a
    dynamical system (Kearney et al., 2011a, Kearney et al., 2011b). The authors also
    proposed varying water level references across time to improve transient performance
    (Kearney and Cantoni, 2012). Neshastehriz et al. proposed a robust MPC method
    that involves offline design of the nominal trajectory to calculate the demand
    forecast (Neshastehriz et al., 2014). In addition, MPC can be used for river flood
    control (Breckpot et al., 2013). In general, large, complex systems such as irrigation
    canals can be separated into several subsystems. To this end, decentralized control
    methods are commonly used, such as decentralized MPC, which are relatively simple
    and easy to handle. However, these methods are suitable for applying to subsystems
    of interactions under conditions that are not very strong. Centralized MPC may
    not be practical because of computational requirements or the ability to obtain
    a solution that includes all subsystems in a complex, large-scale system. In addition,
    this method is difficult to reconcile and maintain because the computations are
    complex and all subsystems must trust a central controller. Another approach is
    distributed MPC, in which local MPC controls the entire system and requires less
    computational power than centralized MPC. This allows for information exchange
    and closed-loop control, but the control accuracy is highly dependent on the communication
    and collaboration between local agents. Hierarchical MPC can quickly deliver water
    to users with only a small amount of communication. The higher level subsystems
    control the whole, and the variables are created by the subsystems at lower levels
    (Scattolini and Colaneri, 2007). The hierarchical and distributed MPCs can be
    used together to further optimize the operation of irrigation canals. The use
    of these technologies is essential for agricultural activities in arid and semiarid
    regions. Although the MPC schemes used in irrigation are diverse, most of them
    have rarely been tested in actual canals. Future research should focus on testing
    methods in actual large irrigation canals, the performance and parameter settings
    of different controllers at depth, and the robust and stochastic controllers used
    to resolve uncertainty in system dynamics. Table 2 shows the application of MPC
    schemes in irrigation systems. Table 2. Application of MPC schemes in an irrigation

    et al., 2015, Sadowska, et al., 2015 3.2. Agricultural machinery According to
    statistics from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the
    world''s population will increase to 9.1 billion by 2050. To feed this growing
    people, more efficient and accurate agricultural production machines using automation
    are required. To ensure efficient agricultural machinery production, agricultural
    machinery navigation, path tracking and steering control are very important. 3.2.1.
    Navigation operation The purpose of agricultural autonomous navigation or guidance
    is to control the vehicle trajectory to maintain it a constant distance from the
    adjacent travel line or to place the strip side by side in accordance with agricultural
    conditions without overlapping or gaps. An autonomous tractor must maintain and
    follow a precise trajectory during tillage to avoid damage to crops or plants.
    In the cruise control system of a combine harvester, the relationship between
    the input signal and actual speed is nonlinear, but the relationship can be transformed
    into a time-varying linear model. Time-varying features and constraints require
    an online calculation control method. MPC is the best choice for this purpose.
    Coen et al. used constraint MPC with an alternative active set method (ASM) to
    achieve cruise control for a combine harvester (Coen et al., 2008). The computation
    time of the ASM is nearly 100 times less than that of the standard interior point
    method (IPM). Backman et al. used NMPC to complete a navigation task. At a speed
    of 12 km/h, sufficient accuracy is required for up to 10 cm of lateral error (Backman
    et al., 2012). Kraus et al. proposed a moving horizon estimation (MHE)-NMPC framework
    for autonomous tractor navigation. The average deviation from the time-based reference
    trajectory on slightly curved strips is 0.26 m, and the average deviation in headland
    turns on a wet and bumpy grass field is 0.60 m (Kraus et al., 2013). In addition
    to agricultural machine navigation, MPC can also be used for inland navigation
    (Horvath et al., 2014). 3.2.2. Path-tracking operation The tractor-trailer system
    can significantly improve the transport efficiency of an object. However, because
    of multiple complex bodies in the system, path-tracking control is very complicated.
    Kayacan et al. elaborated a rapidly distributed nonlinear MPC scheme integrated
    with nonlinear moving horizon estimation (NMHE) for estimating the state and parameters
    (Kayacan et al., 2014). The authors also presented a centralized nonlinear MPC
    (CeNMPC) method with MHE (Kayacan et al., 2015a, Kayacan et al., 2015b, Kayacan
    et al., 2015c). However, because deploying the MIMO system is a time-consuming
    task, the centralized control method may be computationally infeasible. Thus,
    the decentralized MPC (DeMPC) method can be used as an alternative solution. Kayacan
    et al. also proposed a robust tube-based DeNMPC (decentralized NMPC)-NMHE method.
    The computational time of the method is less than 75% of the CeNMPC time (Kayacan,
    2015). The MPC could also be used to control the yaw dynamics of a tractor. The
    authors’ results showed that the Euclidean error of the time-based straight line
    trajectory is less than 40 cm, while the time-based curve trajectory is 60 cm
    (Kayacan et al., 2015a, Kayacan et al., 2015b, Kayacan et al., 2015c). Linear
    MPC (LMPC) was designed for the path-tracking error control of unmanned ground
    vehicles, and the results showed that the average Euclidian distance errors for
    the tractor and the trailer on straight lines were 23.49 and 21.21 cm, respectively,
    whereas those on curved lines were 39.82 and 36.21 cm. The calculation time of
    LMPC was approximately 1.1 ms, which was less than that of NMPC (Kayacan et al.,
    2015a, Kayacan et al., 2015b, Kayacan et al., 2015c). In the future, these designs
    can be extended to create a dynamic model. Yang et al. presented explicit MPC
    based on a multiparametric mixed-integer quadratic programming (mp-MIQP) technique
    that could reduce the tracking errors of a trailer and smooth the steering angle
    behavior of a tractor (Yang and Taehyun, 2012). Yakub et al. compared MPC and
    linear quadratic control (LQC) and fond that MPC showed better tracking performance
    than did LQC, especially in constrained multivariable systems (Yakub and Mori,
    2015). Plessen et al. proposed a linear time-varying MPC (LTV-MPC) method to generate
    offline reference trajectories for high-precision closed-loop tracking. The method
    can achieve millimeter-precision tracking (Plessen and Bemporad, 2017). Zhang
    et al. presented an RMPC method for automatic operation boats (AOBs) to deliver
    bait uniformly along desired paths. The maximum deviation errors in the turning
    points and the straight lines were 0.36 m and 0.09 m, respectively. This method
    performed better than did traditional fuzzy PD control. In the future, this scheme
    could be combined with neural network learning techniques (Zhang, et al., 2017a,
    Zhang et al., 2017b, Zhang et al., 2017c). In addition, path-following control
    with MPC could be used to design an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) (Hernandez et
    al., 2015). In forests, MPC could also be applied for the path tracking of a hydraulic
    forestry crane (Kalmari et al., 2014, Kalmari et al., 2017). 3.2.3. Steering operation
    In general, operators must manually turn around at the end of each straight path
    and then reconnect the automatic guidance system to follow the next path. The
    automation of maneuvers in a headland can reduce the burden on drivers and improve
    efficiency. To this end, for a system driving forward, Cariou et al. proposed
    a kinematic model that uses additional sliding parameters and MPC methods. For
    a system running backward, the authors compared two different steering controllers.
    Promising results have suggested that an overall tracking error within ±20 cm
    is obtained during the maneuver (Cariou et al., 2010). Gao et al. proposed a DMC-PD
    cascade approach to control automatic steering. The results indicated that the
    absolute value of the steering angle tracking error was 0.5° and that the tracking
    delay was 0.25 s (Gao et al., 2014). Trajectory tracking is complex and important;
    the use of improved MPC or NMPC can reduce the tracking error and is a feasible
    way to accurately track a path. Distributed NMPC can reduce computation time.
    Future research should focus on improving tracking robustness and studying dynamic
    models. The abovementioned MPC framework can be extended by using dynamic models
    to improve control performance in the system’s transient response. For straight
    lines, the longitudinal velocity is constant, and only the traversing speed of
    the tractor is controlled; for curves, longitudinal velocity control can be improved
    to achieve better trajectory tracking. Exact turns are another key. However, at
    high speed, the steering deviation is large. Future research should focus on this
    problem. Table 3 shows the application of MPC schemes in agricultural machinery

    3.3. Agricultural production and product processing Agricultural products are
    the basis of our existence. This section describes agricultural production and
    product processing, which consist of aquatic production, livestock living environment
    regulation, food drying and biogas feeding. The purpose of MPC use in this area
    is to increase quality and yield. 3.3.1. Aquatic production Fish are renewable
    resources. However, as more people eat fish, the number of fish continues to drop
    dramatically. A recent review by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) reported
    that aquaculture has failed to fill the gap between supply and demand and lacks
    suitable management. MPC can be used to solve these problems. Bounkhel et al.
    proposed NMPC for establishing the best harvest efforts for renewable resource
    systems such as fish. This NMPC scheme determines the optimal control of the time
    interval. It is suggested that experiments be carried out on more complex models
    in the future, such as with the use of constant or dynamic discount factors (Bounkhel
    and Tadj, 2015). The price of aquatic products is an actual reflection of the
    supply and demand of those products, the reasonable forecast of which could not
    only maximize profits for enterprise but also provide a scientific basis for governmental
    decision making. Liu et al. developed a price model for aquatic products using
    the theory of predictive control; the model is defined by the pattern of supply
    and demand changes, and the authors discussed the influence of parameters on the
    dynamic characteristics and robustness of the model (Liu et al., 2012). 3.3.2.
    Livestock living environment regulation The efficient control of the indoor climate
    in a livestock stable not only saves on energy and costs and improves productivity
    but is also good for animal growth and helps reduce global warming. Typical modern
    stabilization systems are usually equipped with mixed ventilation; thus, modeling
    involves at least three key aspects: mechanical ventilation mode, natural ventilation
    mode, and a control strategy. Ventilation in a naturally ventilated dairy building
    clearly is always higher than required, leading to increased ammonia emissions.
    Shen et al. applied response surface methodology (RSM) to exploit a predictive
    model and used CFD tools to simulate naturally ventilated dairy buildings. This
    model can determine the ventilation rate under different wind and opening conditions
    and thus reduces the risk of high ammonia emissions (Shen et al., 2013). CFDs
    often result in models that are too complex and computationally harsh, whereas
    MPC can provide reasonable accuracy to reflect actual systems. Yang et al. found
    that the errors in optimal livestock indoor climate control models can be compensated
    for by using constraint MPC (Yang et al., 2009). However, there should be some
    trade-off between implementation costs and expected performance. Temperature and
    carbon dioxide are also important for the growth of chickens. Li et al. designed
    an MPC method for controlling the wind velocity, temperature, and CO2 concentration
    in coops. The method can predict the trends of each variable and is favorable
    for stabilizing wind velocity-temperature-gas control (Li et al., 2015). 3.3.3.
    Food drying Research on grain-drying controls began in the 1960s. Control was
    mainly achieved by traditional control techniques such as feedback and adaptive
    control methods. In the 1970s, with the development of computer technologies and
    artificial intelligence, intelligent control technologies such as the artificial
    neural network and fuzzy control were used. Since the 1980s, scholars have conducted
    MPC studies of the grain-drying process (Wang et al., 2008). Liu et al. proposed
    using principal component analysis (PCA) and neural network partial least squares
    (NNPLS) to design a process controller in the nonlinear MPC framework for maize
    drying (Liu et al., 2006). Han et al. established an MPC system based on a neural
    network and developed software to provide online measurement as well as automatic
    control of changes in grain parameters (Han et al., 2012). Zhang et al. established
    a drying MPC system that can detect grain temperature, hot-air temperature, and
    grain moisture parameters automatically (Zhang et al., 2013). Hernandez et al.
    designed a constrained nonlinear predictive controller to adjust the moisture
    content of fishmeal to acquire a stable final product (Hernandez et al., 2014).
    Zhou et al. presented a distributed parameter MPC (DP-MPC) scheme for forced air
    ventilation. This scheme decreased energy consumption by 15.5% compared with that
    under no ventilation control (Zhou et al., 2014). The deviation in temperature
    control was within 1 °C, and that in moisture content was within 1%. Automatic
    control of the grain-drying process can better ensure the quality of grain drying.
    In the future, we should focus on stability analysis of such control strategies
    during actual production. In addition, certain methods should be tested under
    actual processing conditions. 3.3.4. Biogas feeding Energy crops and other valuable
    resources are used to produce biogas by digesters. However, due to the high dimensionality
    and nonlinearity of the anaerobic digestion process, it is complex and challenging
    to predict the biogas yield of different substrate mixtures. Gaida et al. proposed
    an NMPC scheme to optimally control the substrate feed for agricultural biogas
    plants. The plant operator could gain 550 € per day compared with previous earnings
    (Gaida et al., 2012). This section focuses on the application of MPC in agricultural
    production and product processing. For aquatic products, MPC can predict and control
    the best harvesting efforts for fish, but future experiments should be conducted
    with more complex models. For livestock, MPC can effectively control the indoor
    climate, which is conducive to animal growth, and is more suitable than CFD. In
    the case of grain ventilation, MPC can effectively control grain water content
    and temperature while consuming less energy. For grain drying, MPC can reduce
    the water content of products and thus improve the germination rate. For high-volume,
    nonlinear biogas, MPC can effectively control the substrate feed of an agricultural
    biogas plant, which greatly increases revenue by reducing waste. In the future,
    these algorithms can be operated in practice. The application of MPC schemes in
    agricultural products and the processing of these products are shown in Table
    4. Table 4. Application of MPC schemes in agricultural products and the processing
    of these products. Applicable object Methods Improvements Control object Controller

    has gained increasing social and economic significance (El Ghoumari et al., 2005).
    However, because of strong coupling, high nonlinearity, the incorporation of MIMO
    systems and disturbances, this type of agriculture is very difficult to implement
    in practice (Hu et al., 2011). Traditional control theory cannot meet the needs
    of increasingly complex greenhouse control systems. As one of the leading methods
    in process control, MPC performs well in controlling greenhouse temperatures.
    Ghoumar et al. proposed a nonlinear constrained MPC method to control air temperature
    and compared it with the adaptive PID controller. The MPC scheme showed better
    performance (El Ghoumari et al., 2005). In the future, this scheme can be optimized
    based on economic criteria. Natural ventilation can regulate the temperature and
    humidity of a greenhouse. Gruber et al. presented a nonlinear MPC method and used
    natural ventilation to control greenhouse temperatures (Gruber et al., 2011).
    New variables could be considered in future. However, the nonlinear model is computationally
    intensive. Piñón et al. combined feedback linearization (FL) and standard linear
    MPC. The performances of the FL-MPC and NMPC methods were analogous, but the former
    decreased the computational load (Pinon et al., 2005). Blasco et al. proposed
    a model-based predictive control (MBPC) scheme to decrease energy and water consumption
    in a greenhouse, although costs could be reduced further in future studies (Blasco
    et al., 2007) GPC and DMC are also significant. Pawlowski et al. discussed issues
    concerning measurable disturbance rejection in GPC (Pawlowski et al., 2012a, Pawlowski
    et al., 2012b). Most control loops are realized as computer-based control systems
    and are controlled by a periodic sampling time. However, the sampling time could
    be aperiodic in an event-based strategy. Therefore, the authors also presented
    a GPC method that was combined with event-based sampling techniques. The main
    advantages of this combination are that it not only reduces the actuation load
    but also maintains the control system performance at an acceptable level (Pawlowski
    et al., 2012a, Pawlowski et al., 2012b). Xu et al. proposed an approach based
    on DMC whose overall performance is superior to that of PID control (Xu et al.,
    2013). However, the reaction time deficiency is long. Zhang et al. integrated
    DMC with PID control. The results show that the order of the optimal temperature
    control time in a greenhouse is as follows: DMC-PID < DMC < Smith control < integral-separation
    PID (Zhang and Chen, 2011). Ito established a temperature controller incorporating
    MPC for a greenhouse, and its performance was shown to be better than that of
    conventional PWM control (Ito, 2012). The controller features a temperature tracking
    error of fewer than 1.2°C at peak-to-peak values and less than 0.7 °C at the maximum
    values. González et al. presented a tube-based MPC framework for controlling a
    system with two-time-scale dynamics (González et al., 2014). Many other related
    methods studies have also addressed greenhouse temperature control (Ramdani et
    al., 2015, Ma et al., 2015, Coelho et al., 2005, Hu et al., 2011). Temperature
    and humidity are important greenhouse environmental parameters. Classical PID
    control and natural ventilation can control the temperature to some extent; however,
    the performance of MPC is better, and MPC can associate greenhouse temperature
    with window aperture, external temperature, external wind speed, soil surface
    temperature and external global solar radiation. However, more interferences,
    constraints, optimization algorithms and economic factors should be considered
    and tested in practice in the future. Table 5 shows the applications of MPC schemes
    for greenhouse control. Table 5. Application of MPC schemes for greenhouse control.

    quickly Zhang and Chen (2011) This chapter mainly discusses the current applications
    of MPC in agriculture. Today, MPC is mainly used in irrigation, agricultural machinery,
    agricultural products and processing, and greenhouse environments. The applications
    in agriculture are few, and many control schemes are only simulations, with few
    having been used under actual operating conditions. Moreover, the methods most
    often used are classical MPC and improved MPC or methods optimized for MPC. Some
    of the latest MPC technologies such as stochastic MPC, hybrid MPC, and explicit
    MPC have rarely been used in agriculture. In the future, MPC can be extended to
    agriculture applications to seek better optimization methods and incorporate more
    advanced MPC technology. 4. Challenges and future perspectives MPC cannot describe
    unstable systems and originally had difficulty recognizing online models, but
    it now reduces calculation time while maintaining high performance. The biggest
    challenge in the future may be the trade-off between computing time, performance
    level, and economic cost. It is very difficult to reduce calculation time and
    cost without affecting performance. In addition, for some complex algorithms,
    it is very difficult to guarantee stability and feasibility. Thus, some of those
    algorithms are likely to remain theoretical. Actual applications are complicated
    and difficult to achieve. Moreover, due to the complexity of real systems, more
    hardware, better optimization algorithms and the expansion of the control law
    of MIMO systems and nonlinear processes are very important. The application of
    MPC in agriculture is far less extensive than its application in industry. Large
    systems such as irrigation systems must reduce computation times and now incorporate
    distributed MPC and hierarchical MPC. In the future, the latest schemes, such
    as explicit MPC and stochastic MPC, could be used as well. For dynamic systems
    such as agricultural machinery systems, dynamic models can be researched in the
    future. The processing of agricultural products can be combined with more complex
    models, and greenhouse temperature control schemes should consider more interferences
    in the future. Overall, the state of MPC use in agriculture can be summarized
    in three respects. First, the application of MPC in agriculture is limited. MPC
    can be applied to more aspects of agriculture to improve efficiency and yield
    in the future. These applications include aquaponics, which is an efficient compound
    farming technology strongly reliant on precision regulation; pest and disease
    control; the fishing industry; fodder; and the seed industry. Second, some of
    the latest MPC technologies, such as stochastic MPC and hybrid MPC, can also be
    applied to areas of agriculture. Third, many control methods are still only simulations
    and are not in practice. Future research can focus on applying those methods to
    real scenarios. 5. Conclusions This review has briefly discussed the current development
    of MPC and its application in agriculture. Despite the many reviews of MPC and
    its development in industry, no summary of MPC use in agricultural applications
    has yet been published. In this article, we have roughly divided the development
    of MPC into three stages according to the different problems solved. Classical
    MPC mainly solves multivariable constraint control problems. However, this method
    is not suitable for nonlinear systems. To solve robust and nonlinear control problems,
    adaptive MPC, robust MPC and nonlinear MPC were established. Later, with increasing
    requirements pertaining to control performance and calculation time and to reduce
    computational time, distributed MPC, explicit MPC, hybrid MPC, tube-based MPC
    and stochastic MPC were introduced. These MPC methods reduce computation time
    by decentralizing large-scale problems, reducing computation time directly, or
    simplifying computational processes. In addition, we reviewed nearly a decade’s
    worth of MPC articles on agriculture applications. Since the MPC was established
    as an industrial process control algorithm, its application to agriculture has
    been very limited. According to the relevant articles we found, the applications
    of MPC in agriculture include but are not limited to irrigation systems, agricultural
    machinery, agricultural production and product processing and greenhouses. MPC
    applied to these agricultural aspects can yield significant productivity and efficiency
    benefits. Although distributed MPC, nonlinear MPC, robust MPC, DMC, and GPC are
    used in these applications, some of the latest MPC schemes, such as hybrid MPC,
    tube-based MPC, and stochastic MPC, are less frequently used. In addition, agricultural
    applications are very limited. There are many areas of agriculture that do not
    use MPC. Most of these studies are simply simulations with no testing under practical
    applications. Thus, there is much room for future applications of MPC in agriculture.

    Citations Keywords Metrics Abstract: A closed loop irrigation system is demonstrated
    that fully automates the delivery of irrigation and calculates the water requirement
    from satellite images. The system optimizes water delivery for 140 cells located
    across four hectares of land based on two independent objectives (e.g., maximizing
    yield and increasing water efficiency) and is continuously adapting irrigation
    scheduling to the local spatial–temporal variability of the vegetation across
    the growing season. Irrigation is controlled by a central computer that issues
    commands to 693 control nodes to start irrigation based on the analysis of satellite
    images. The control nodes are laid out to create 15 m ×15 m cells and each cell
    can be addressed independently and can irrigate differentially. After two years
    of operation, this variable rate drip irrigation approach resulted in a 26% yield
    increase in the second year and an average increase of 16% in water use efficiency.
    This paper demonstrates that combining closed loop automation and advanced irrigation
    analytics can improve the water use efficiency and increase the yield on existing
    agricultural lands. Published in: IEEE Internet of Things Journal ( Volume: 5,

    Abstract The overall purpose of this work was to show that by measuring the complex
    permittivity of soil, feedback signals can be achieved for both water and fertiliser
    input. It is well known that the real part of soil permittivity is closely connected
    to the volumetric water content. So sensors based on this principle are available
    for controlling irrigation. For controlling fertilisation, a newer development
    is the assessment of the pore water conductivity by measuring also the imaginary
    part of the soil permittivity. Washout experiments have shown that this ‘salinity’
    (the pore water conductivity, based on the ion concentration in the plant available
    water) is mostly influenced by nitrate ions under agricultural circumstances.
    Lysimeter experiments with rape demonstrated that by measuring the complex permittivity,
    the actual amount of salts available to the crop could be mapped quite clearly,
    when the salinity measurements were corrected to salinity values at constant soil
    moisture (here: to values at field capacity). In conclusion, it is shown that
    a controlled fertilisation can be as straightforward as controlling irrigation.
    The only difference is the much greater time constant. Previous article in issue

    1. Purpose and approach Water and fertiliser are important inputs into plant production.
    Due to natural influences (type of soil, climate, crop growth, etc.) there are
    considerable variations in the ability of the soil to supply water and fertiliser
    over time. So for controlling irrigation and fertilisation, real time feedback
    signals on soil state are needed. The overall aim of this paper is to achieve
    and to test signals characterising soil, in order to facilitate the above management
    actions. The signals should describe the water content and the nutritional state
    of the test site. Because sensors are the bottleneck in most control schemes for
    agricultural production processes, such investigations are a key to improve management.
    Closed loop control or minimisation procedures may then be developed straightforwardly.
    As the characterising signal the complex permittivity (=dielectric constant) of
    soil has been chosen. Techniques for measuring the soil permittivity include time
    domain (TDR-) sensors and frequency domain (FD-) sensors, see Noborio (2001) and
    Dirksen and Hilhorst (1994). For volumetric water content, various manufacturers
    offer appropriate sensors based on measuring the real part of permittivity. Recently
    a sensor had been developed and evaluated in an European project (Balendonck et
    al., 1998) to measure both, the real and imaginary part of permittivity. The real
    part of soil permittivity is known to depend strongly on its water content and
    is therefore suited for irrigation systems. Various authors, including Balendonck
    et al. (1998) have shown the possibilities of these sensors in a complete water
    control system. The imaginary part of the permittivity is related to the conductivity
    of the bulk soil, the three phase mixture of air, water and particles. Hilhorst
    (2000) has deduced that by measuring both the real and the imaginary part of permittivity
    (=bulk soil conductivity), the electrical conductivity (EC) of the pore water
    (=salinity) in soil can be computed. The salinity computed in this way expresses
    the ion concentration in the pore water, which is available for plants. In agricultural
    soils, nitrate is one of the most active and movable ions. So if ion conductivity
    can be measured, the next question is, whether the nitrate ion is the main influence
    on the salinity measurement. Further, it must be investigated whether the salinity
    values are influenced by the amount of diluting water in the soil pores. If so,
    then by taking the soil moisture (=volumetric water content) into account, the
    suitability of the humidity corrected ‘salinity’ as information for a controlled
    fertiliser application is to be tested. The objective of this paper is to study
    the correlations between the signals of permittivity and the actual states of
    water and fertiliser in soil. If there are strong correlations, continuous measurement
    in soil will open new possibilities for controlled agriculture. In particular,
    if fertilisation rates can be determined as simply as irrigation rates, new possibilities
    of controlling water and fertiliser application can be contemplated. 2. Methods
    2.1. Lysimeter set-up To provide the basis for a control scheme applicable to
    irrigation and fertilisation, three lysimeters of 1 m height and 50 cm diameter
    were installed. The tests in these laboratory lysimeters were intended to provide
    information on the behaviour of the above processes in soil. Two lysimeters contained
    different soils, i.e. sandy loam and loess, artificially filled with A and B horizons.
    The third lysimeter was equipped with original grassland (sandy loam). Sensors
    were imbedded for continuous measurements of both real and imaginary permittivity
    (water content and EC), together with tensiometers for measuring the water tension
    and with temperature sensors. Measurements were taken automatically every 20 min
    at three depths: 10, 50 and 90 cm each. Rape was chosen as the crop, because it
    is known to have strong, deep-going roots. It is therefore well suited to generate
    a dry deep layer and, by this, to guarantee no fertiliser or water transport beyond
    that barrier. Irrigation and fertilisation were carried out manually with weighed
    amounts. The experimental set-up is shown in Fig. 1. Beside these 1 m lysimeters,
    for preliminary tests regarding the washout process and the ionic concentration
    in the drainage water six small lysimeters of 15 cm diameter as shown in Fig.
    2 were used. They were filled with different soils to a height of ∼20 cm. At the
    beginning the soil was rinsed with tap water (EC=0.1 mS/cm). Then fertiliser was
    dissolved and applied to the surface of the wet soil columns, corresponding to
    30, 60 or 90 kg N/ha. In the following weeks the soils were irrigated regularly
    every 2 or 3 days (depending on weekend) with ∼1/3 of their free water according
    to field capacity (≈200 ml). With each addition of water, fertiliser was washed
    through the soil column. The drainage water was collected after every watering
    event and measured for EC and nitrate. Download : Download full-size image Fig.

    EC in washout water (FD, frequency domain sensor). 2.2. Real permittivity and
    water content For measuring the amount of water in soil, the real part of the
    bulk dielectric constant (real permittivity ε′) is known to be well suited. Practical
    instruments based on measurements in the time or at constant frequencies are offered
    by various providers. A new development on the standing-wave ratio (Sun et al.,
    1999) is promising. Unfortunately, the permittivity is not only dependent on the
    soil moisture, but also on temperature, density and on the type of soil. So each
    soil has to be calibrated. For sandy soils, often an approximation by Topp et
    al. (1980) is taken: (1) Newer developments (Paul et al., 1998) have shown that
    a self-calibration is also possible to a certain extent, when measuring over different
    frequencies (here 10, 20 and 30 MHz) and taking dispersion into account. Moreover,
    when evaluating this ‘Maxwell–Wagner effect’, the soil type can also be identified.
    2.3. Imaginary permittivity and electrical conductivity of pore water The imaginary
    part of soil permittivity ε″ is at frequencies low with respect to relaxation
    mainly influenced by the bulk soil conductivity (σbulk). The bulk soil conductivity
    is a function of the volumetric water content Θ and its ionic conductivity (ECwater
    or σwater). Conductivity of the free pore water (available for plants) is usually
    taken as a measure of soil salinity, because this conductivity is based only on
    the ionic concentration. As shown by Hilhorst (1998) and Hilhorst (2000), the
    ionic conductivity of the soil solution can be expressed by the measurable values
    of the complex permittivity of the bulk soil as (2) with σb=2pfε0εb″ as ionic
    bulk conductivity, at constant frequencies only dependent on the imaginary part
    of the bulk soil permittivity. The index w is the water stands for the water extractable
    from soil, the index b is the bulk denotes a measurement in bulk soil. The factor
    F is ∼1 in wet soil and εb dry can be measured with values between 3.5 and 8,
    depending on soil texture. As standard a value of 5 is taken. According to Eq.
    (2), σwater, the ionic conductivity of the soil solution available for plants,
    is so calculated from the simultaneously measured real and imaginary part of the
    permittivity of bulk soil (right part of Eq. (2)). 3. Preliminary measurements
    Preliminary measurements in the small lysimeters shown in Fig. 2 were made to
    compare the calculated salinity with the measured EC-value in the drainage water.
    The volumetric water content and the bulk conductivity of the soil were measured
    in the upper soil layer (5 cm). From these values the salinity of the soil was
    computed. The tests were done in various soils, here shown by the example of sandy
    loam. Of these lysimeters, three columns had normal density, in the other three
    columns a formerly treated soil (some residues of urea lead later on to deviations
    in nitrate concentration) was artificially compacted. Fig. 3 shows the development
    of EC and nitrate in drainage water compared to EC in soil and to salinity (EC
    in pore water). During each leaching a constant amount of ∼1/3 of the free water
    in soil was replaced. So the salts were washed out, appearing with some time delay
    in the drainage water. Because EC and nitrate in drainage water are developing
    in parallel, it seems obvious, that salinity measurements under agricultural circumstances
    were mostly influenced by the nitrate content. Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 3. Development of salinity and accompanying values. If in soil the water
    replacement behaved as an ideal piston flow, after four irrigations the initial
    concentration at the surface would be washed through the column and would appear
    in the drainage water. As could be expected, the soil matrix retards the transition
    process. Because the EC values of the bulk soil were small and varied very little,
    they are omitted in the further discussion. The concentration is on the development
    of salinity, which is decreasing constantly as a result of the washout process.
    From Fig. 3 the following Fig. 4 was deduced, where the maximum salinities in
    both soil types are recorded. It shows that the amount of fertiliser applied is
    closely related to the salinity measurements in the upper soil layer. At low fertiliser
    input (30 kg N/ha) the reading in the compacted soil is topped by the urea residues,
    producing nitrate to a considerable amount by bacterial action. Given a known
    soil, the salinity corresponds to the actual fertiliser (mainly nitrate) state.
    This can also seen by the development of salinity in Fig. 5 during another leaching
    process, where also the amount of potassium (<1/10th of nitrate!) in the drainage
    water was recorded. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Measured initial

    experiments and discussion On the basis of the preliminary measurements, feedback
    simulations on irrigation and fertilisation were conducted in the 1 m indoor lysimeters.
    In these lysimeters rape was grown on sandy loam and on loess. During the test,
    no drainage occurred and the soil moisture varied according to water inputs and
    evapotranspiration. The irrigation was applied in doses of 4 mm (=1 l/lysimeter)
    or multiples of it (8 or 12 mm). 4.1. Controlled irrigation The experiment started
    with saturated, bare soil in the lysimeters. The total course of soil moisture
    over time in terms of volumetric water content is given in Fig. 6. The initial
    drying out at ∼18 °C with no crop was slow and therefore is not included here.
    The lysimeters were seeded with rape at the end of August. By October the crop
    had enough leaf area to transpire considerable amounts of water. Also a drying
    of deeper layers began, hinting that the crop had enough roots to reach all available
    water. In the middle of October, when the upper layer was completely dried out
    (10% or 500 kPa), a controlled irrigation dependent on actual state began. In
    November the upper soil layer was kept in a reasonably wet condition by manually
    controlled water inputs at a refill point of 20% soil moisture. The middle layer
    was held between 10 and 15% moisture, whereas the lowest layer further dried out
    continuously. At the end of the experiment (flowering of the rape) this development
    was still going on. The plants had been supplied with water to keep the upper
    layer at optimal moisture between 10 and 50 kPa, the deeper dry layer had developed
    up to dry 200 kPa. The figure also shows the time constants of the top, middle
    and deep layers. Whereas the surface layer reacts immediately to irrigation, the
    time constants in deeper layers are enormous. Basically, this picture is true
    for the other soil types. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 6. Two point
    regulation of water content in the upper layer. It is interesting to compare the
    water tension and the water content during the simulated management of irrigation,
    because water tension is often said to be the better signal for irrigation. A
    daily water application of 1 l (=4 mm) or 2 l, depending on volumetric water content
    during the week, was combined with mostly 4 l during weekends. Fig. 6 shows that
    a classical 2 point controller, based on volumetric water content as measured
    by real permittivity, acting when the refill point of 20% is reached, can readily
    keep the optimum moisture at around tensions between 20 and 40 kPa or water contents
    between 20 and 25% in the upper layer. Even greater time intervals with no water
    input (weekends) can easily be processed. The moisture at 50 cm depth is held
    between 12 and 15% or 40 and 80 kPa. The wetter values are following the wetter
    conditions at the top with a considerable time lag. The drying out of the lowest
    layer was still underway at the end of recording. The experiment was repeated
    some months later (Fig. 7). It was started with a very shallow water table at
    1 m depth, which caused quite a wet soil. On 18th January the shallow water table
    was removed, and the soil dried out. At the end of January, irrigation began.
    As before, the amount of water again was given according to the actual volumetric
    water content. By measuring at different depths also the development of a dry
    layer beneath the root zone and so the minimisation of water usage can be seen.
    Fig. 7 shows this irrigation according to soil moisture measurements (here in
    terms of tensions) and a manually simulated two point controller with weekend
    variations beginning on 1st February. As above, in the long run the deeper layer
    dried out. With a controlled irrigation there was no difficulty in holding the
    preset conditions in the root zone, in terms of tension between 0 and 40 kPa.

    removing shallow water table. 4.2. Controlled fertilisation As salinity is strongly
    influenced by plant available nitrogen (results reported above), then fertiliser
    can be applied according to demand. Advanced strategies such as minimum pollution
    via washout can be implemented. Experiments were carried out in the 1 m lysimeters
    filled with sandy loam and loess and growing rape. The salinities according to
    Eq. (2) are given in Fig. 8. Surprisingly, the expected increase in salinity following
    the fertilising event with 90 kg N/ha on 1st February could not be seen. The only
    steps to be seen are the decreases at the irrigation events, started on the same
    day. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 8. Salinity as computed to Eq. (2).
    Clearly, when a given amount of salts is in solution, the concentration and therefore
    the salinity changes with the amount of diluting water. So the salinity values
    have to be corrected for soil moisture variations. To do this, both an extra drying
    processes and an evaluation of the measured values in the lysimeters were carried
    out. Fig. 9 shows the development of the salinity during concentration due to
    drying in two small lysimeters with sandy loam. Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 9. Salinity over volumetric water content. ■=lysimeter 1, ×=lysimeter
    2. Taking the salinity values of Fig. 8 and relating them to the measured soil
    moistures, here expressed as tensions, this dependence can also be seen in Fig.
    10. In soil, the processes are complicated (beginning with cation exchange, ending
    with microbiology) and partly unknown. However, from Fig. 9, Fig. 10 and the assumption
    that for some days the total change in salts including nitrate was limited (no
    washout, little plant uptake), a linear or a mild polynomial correction for the
    salinity can be considered. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 10. Salinity
    over water tensions. A linear relation to a wet soil basis at field capacity was
    chosen. All salinity values (S) were then corrected. The linear correction formulas
    given empirically by Fig. 9 or Fig. 10 with tension h measured in kPa are (3)
    (4) With these corrected salinities, a clear response to plant uptake and fertilisation
    is obtained (Fig. 11). In January, the salinity in the upper soil layer decreased
    in both the sandy loam and the loess type of soils, due to plant uptake. On 1st
    February the effects of fertiliser applied equivalent to 90 kg N/ha (given as
    a full fertiliser), can be seen. Whereas in sandy loam a sharp increase occurred,
    in loess, with its buffer capacity, a smaller step was followed by a further increase.
    In both cases, after ∼2 weeks continued growth, the supply began to diminish.
    After ∼5 weeks the soil was depleted and nearly the same salinities were reached
    as immediately before fertilising. The original supply was taken up by the plants,
    and the next application of fertilising salts was necessary to avoid nutritional
    stress. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 11. Salinity, corrected for wet
    soils. Based on the possibility to measure and compute the plant available salinity
    (mainly nitrate content in pore water), strategies for fertilising can be deduced.
    In the example of the lysimeter experiments with rape in sandy loam and loess,
    the decrease in salinity due to plant uptake can be seen. When the refill point
    is reached, the fertiliser can be applied. An increase in salinity (in sandy loam
    a step) after fertilisation and the following decrease because of further plant
    uptake is apparent in the upper soil layer (10 cm depth). After 1 month, the amount
    of fertiliser applied has been taken up. The next dosage can be deduced according
    to measured values of moisture corrected salinity in order to fill up the fertiliser
    reservoir and to keep salinity in an optimal range. 5. Conclusions The simultaneous
    measurement of permittivity in soil in its real and imaginary part offers new
    possibilities for controlled irrigation and fertilisation. Regarding irrigation
    only, by continuously sampling data on real permittivity at various depths, the
    total amount of needed water can be deduced. Regarding fertilisation, by measuring
    the corrected soil salinities, the total amount of needed fertiliser can be assessed.
    So with measuring the complex permittivity, at least in lysimeter experiments,
    there is a feedback signal for the two most important inputs to plant production.
    In particular, the approach to controlled fertilisation based on measuring salinity
    is promising. The salinity expresses the ion concentrations (under agricultural
    conditions mainly nitrate ions) in the pore water, which are available for plants
    and which equals the amount of salts possibly washed out into deeper soil layers.
    To come to a controlled fertiliser application, a correction of the salinity values
    to the state in wet soils is proposed. These corrections can be calibrated for
    different soils. For practical application individual measurements may suffer
    from natural variabilities (Schmitz and Sourell, 2000). So a single point assessment
    would have clear limits in the above control context. But with multiple measurements
    and appropriate mean values a new approach is given not only for controlled irrigation
    but also for optimal plant nutrition or minimal pollution. Acknowledgements The

  key_findings: The real part of soil permittivity can provide feedback signals for
    irrigation control, while the imaginary part can be used to assess soil salinity
    and control fertilizer application. The imaginary part of permittivity is influenced
    by the pore water conductivity, which is strongly correlated with the plant-available
    nitrogen content in soil. By correcting salinity measurements for soil moisture
    variations, a reliable estimate of plant-available nutrients can be obtained.
  limitations: The study is limited to laboratory lysimeter experiments and may not
    directly translate to real-world field conditions. The accuracy and reliability
    of the permittivity measurements under varying soil conditions and environmental
    factors need further evaluation. Additionally, the algorithms for correcting salinity
    values based on soil moisture need to be optimized for different soil types and
    cropping systems.
  main_objective: To investigate the potential of using soil permittivity measurements
    for closed-loop control of irrigation and fertilization.

    Location: Coimbatore, India SECTION I. Introduction Wireless technologies have
    been growing fast in recent years. These technologies are classified depending
    on the range of communication between sensor nodes. For shorter distances Infra
    red (IR) sensors based on light, point to multipoint communication Wireless Personal
    Area Network (WPAN), long distance communication GSM/GPRS/DTMF and Bluetooth,
    Zigbee can be used. This wireless sensor based system monitors the water requirement
    for a particular crop continuously and sends the feedback to the main system which
    controls the water flow [1]. This system is intelligent enough to send the signals
    on mobile of the farmer to control the irrigation time and water flow. Adequate
    water flow and irrigation not only maximize the efficiency and production but
    also saves the time and labour of farmers. The sensors developed for measurement
    of soil moisture can also measure temperature of the soil to solve the problems
    related to soil for a particular crop. The major challenge faced in dry and semidry
    areas of agricultural land is the water regulation for crops. Recent technologies
    are trying to benefit and solve these problems [2]. In some areas even water flow
    requirement is such a big issue that farmers are facing economical as well as
    sustainability issue. Sensors are used to improve the decision making capability
    of the system by sending feedback. Soil moisture sensor senses the environmental
    and soil conditions which can be sent back to the system for efficient performance.
    The systems developed so far in this context are wired based data loggers which
    are costly and have an installation issue in real time interface. This system
    measures information of soil moisture content stored in it and sends it to the
    main system with the help of microcontroller and other electronic devices [2].
    The research work of this paper is related to the development of agricultural
    activities like irrigation, soil temperature and moisture measurement using digital
    technologies and wireless sensors. An automatic wireless sensor i.e. soil moisture
    based Irrigation Water Regulation support system is being developed in this work.
    The proposed system estimates the water requirement for crops on the basis of
    soil moisture data gathered by several sensor nodes deployed in the field. The
    components and technology used in proposed system is explained in section 2. The
    section 3 illustrates the implementation of proposed system. At the last section
    4 and 5 covers the results and conclusion part. SECTION II. Components and Technology
    The proposed system is consisting of Microcontroller unit, Analog to Digital converter,
    Induction motor, Soil moisture sensor, Temperature sensors and DTMF receiver.
    A. Microcontroller Unit Microcontroller is a device used in place of processors
    where the requirement is limited and data rate required is a not big issue. The
    8051 microcontroller has been used as it is low cost, low power and high performance
    unit. It allows a feature of on chip flash programmable memory which makes it
    easier to be reprogrammed within the system. This also makes it easy to interface
    different sensors and input output devices with 8051. B. A to D Converter Analog
    to Digital converter is a device which is used to convert the output of the sensor
    which is analog in nature as microcontroller understands digital data. ADC0804
    is a converter which converts one analog signal into 8 bit digital output which
    is being sent to 8-bit microcontroller. This is a clock driven chip which decides
    the time required to convert the analog value into digital value. C. Induction
    Motor Induction motor is preferred over dc motor because it has low cost, ruggedness,
    smaller size and weight. Apart from the simple design it can operate in dusty
    and explosive environment because the brushes are not being used. Therefore there
    is no possibility of sparking which results in extremely reliable, low maintenance
    operability. Contactors along with relay card are used to switch on and off the
    motor. D. Soil Moisture Sensor Soil moisture sensor is a device which measures
    the water content of the soil. More is the water content in soil lesser is the
    water flow requirement. Some capacitance based sensors are developed in recent
    years which are also known as frequency domain sensors. Another sensor, the neutron
    moisture gauge, utilizes the moderator properties of water for neutrons [3], [4].
    Cheaper sensors are based on two electrodes measuring the resistance of the soil.
    Sometimes this simply consists of two bare (galvanized) wires, but there are also
    probes with wires embedded in gypsum. 1) Different Sensor Constructions a) Iron
    Nails Used as Probes ;The nails are rusted as a result of water present in the
    mixture. It also became difficult to maintain an appropriate distance between
    the heads of the nails given the small diameter of the pipe. The mixture of Plaster
    of Paris and water resulted in a brittle solid mass after drying because of an
    inappropriate amount of water in the mixture prepared. Fig. 1 represents the Sensor
    with iron nails probes. Fig. 1. Sensor with iron nails probes Show All b) Copper
    Electrodes Used as Probes Fig. 2 represent the Sensor with Copper probes. Copper
    probes corroded due the presence of oxygen in air to form a black coloured copper
    patina which gradually turned green with time. The black colour compound formed
    was copper oxide. 2Cu+ O 2 Copper+Oxygen ⟶2CuO ⟶ Copper Oxide (1) View Source
    Hence, the results consistently varied with time due to varying resistance of
    copper electrodes. Fig. 2. Sensor with copper probes Show All c) Aluminium Conductors
    Used as Probes Sensor with aluminium probes is shown in Fig. 3. The sensor was
    successfully constructed and calibrated. Fig. 3. Sensor with aluminium probes
    Show All E. Temperature Sensor (LM 35) Temperature sensors are devices which act
    as transducers to sense the temperature and convert it to voltage proportional
    to temperature in Celsius. LM35 is a sensor used in this system which has low
    output impedance, linear output, and precise inherent calibration which makes
    it easy to get it interfaced with ADC and Microcontroller 8051. F. MT8870 DTMF
    Receiver A receiver is used in this circuit to receive the data from different
    from 16 Dual Tone Multiple Frequency (DTMF) tone pairs and convert the same into
    a 4-bit code which can be easily read by the microcontroller. This receiver is
    DTMF MT-8870 18 pin chip which has in built Differential amplifier with gain settings
    provided internally, clock generator with modifiable guard time and interface
    bus for communicating with external input output devices. It is a low cost receiver
    which uses 3.5 MHz crystal frequency oscillator. The DTMF receiver is easily compatible
    with MT8870/MT8870C-1 which is an advantage of using it. G. Dual Tone Multiple
    Frequency (DTMF) Technology Dual Tone Multiple Frequency is a chip which is widely
    used for analog communication in telephone lines to transmit and receive the data
    between transmitter, receiver handset and switching center. The push buttons on
    mobile provides twelve DTMF signals with different frequency combinations of low
    and high frequencies ranging from 697 Hz to 1477 Hz. Table 1 shows the frequencies
    used for each signal: Table 1. DTMF keypad frequencies The table 1 describes the
    frequencies corresponding to each button pressed every time. Every key pressed
    produces two different tones with different frequencies and produces a resultant
    frequency signal ranging between two selected frequencies. This resultant frequency
    signal is called Dual Tone Multiple Frequency. SECTION III. Mplementation of Proposed
    System A. Block Diagram and Circuit Explanation A Circuit is made which provides
    continuous DC power supply to the microcontroller as well as any other electronic
    device/IC being used in the entire circuit. 220V ac is converted to 24V ac by
    a step-down transformer [4], [5]. A diode bridge rectifier is used to convert
    24V ac to 24V dc and then the Voltage regulator (L7805) brings down the voltage
    to 5V DC. Temperature sensor along with ADC 0804 is interfaced with the microcontroller
    to measure the temperature and give the digital input to the microcontroller.
    LCD is also interfaced with the microcontroller and when the power supply is turned
    ON, the LCD illuminates and displays the room temperature at that time e.g. “TEMP:
    20C”. The block diagram of the proposed system is shown in Fig. 4. Soil moisture
    sensor measures the water content in the soil and its resistance varies accordingly
    and hence the output voltage too. The output of the soil moisture sensor is connected
    to a microcontroller pin. In dry state, the resistance of soil humidity sensor
    is approximately 1.7M ohms and in the wet state i.e. when moisture is present
    the resistance drops down to 0.7M ohm. The voltage across the sensor in the dry
    state (0% volumetric water content) is 1.9V and in the wet state is 0.1 V (50%
    volumetric water content). This voltage signal across the sensor is given to the
    microcontroller pin via an ADC 0804 and the microcontroller using this digital
    equivalent of the signal controls the duration of operation of the induction motor
    through the program fed into it. This induction motor is interfaced with the microcontroller
    via the relay card and the contactor which is connected to the motor starter.
    When the motor is turned on, “MOTOR ON” is displayed on the LCD and when the motor
    is OFF, the LCD displays “MOTOR OFF”. Fig. 4. Block diagram of system Show All
    B. Modeling of Sensorparameters The input parameter which is being sensed by sensor
    is moisture of the soil. The physical quantity (moisture) is being converted into
    electrical quantity (resistance) by the following two methods [6]. a) Volumetric
    Water Content Method Take a known volume of dry soil in a container. Add a known
    volume of water in it. Insert the sensor into the soil and note down its resistance.
    For each epoch, note down the parameters measured in the above steps. Repeat the
    above steps while increasing the amount of water added in Step 2. Calculate soil
    volumetric water content (in %) by the formula given in equation 2: Volume of
    water (in cc) ×100 Volume of Dry Soil (in cc) Volume of soil used=500 cc (2) View
    Source Table 2 Calibration table for volumetric water content method Fig. 5. Volumetric
    water content calibration graph Show All b) Mass percentage method Take a microwave
    safe container and note down its weight. Take some dry soil in a container and
    weigh the container. Insert the sensor into it and note down its resistance. Take
    a fresh sample of soil and add some water into the soil and note down the sensor
    resistance. Weigh the container after adding water. Heat the container in microwave
    for 5 minutes at 800W. Note down the weight of the container now. The difference
    in the weight of the container before and after gives the weight of water present
    in the container. Repeat steps 4 to 6 for different amounts of water added. Calculate
    mass percentage of water by equation 3: Weight of Water ×100 Weight of Dry Soil
    (3) View Source Where Weight of Dry Soil = Weight of (container + soil) after
    putting the container in microwave - Weight of the container Weight of Wet Soil
    = Weight of (container + soil) before putting the container in microwave - Weight
    of the container Weight of Water=Weight of Wet soil−Weight of dry soil. View Source
    Fig. 6. Mass percentage calibration graphs Show All Table 3 Calibration table
    for mass percentage method SECTION IV. Results After designing and implementing
    the proposed system, the following results were observed. Whenever moisture level
    of the soil goes down, it is sensed by the soil moisture sensor and the duration
    of motor operation is controlled depending upon the moisture content of the soil
    [7]. The calibration table gives an accurate estimate of the resistance of sensor
    pertaining to the different values of the volume of water in the mass percentage
    method and the volumetric water content method as well. Thus it possible to have
    a precise calculation of the weight of water from the weight of wet soil and the
    weight of dry soil. Also, the analysis for the mass percentage of water helps
    to have an adequate water regulation for crops and overcomes both the adverse
    conditions of exuberance and scarcity of water at different locations in a field.
    So we deduce that the incorporation of automation in the field of agriculture
    improves the reliability, sustainability and operability of the field. In controlling
    the moisture, the action taken by the microcontroller is tabulated in the table
    4. Testing results in table 4 may vary according the size of the field. It was
    observed that the proposed system led to remarkable savings in use of both water
    and electricity. This not only saves the money of the farmer but also protects
    the fertility of the soil as the proposed system reduces leaching of the soil
    to a great extent [8], [9]. The proposed system is being validated on commercial
    field located in Punjab, Landran. Table 4 Testing results SECTION V. Conclusion
    & Future Scope The proposed soil moisture sensor based automated irrigation system
    is being developed using wireless sensors. The proposed system estimates the water
    requirement for crops on the basis of soil moisture data gathered by several sensor
    nodes deployed in the field. It is concluded that the proposed system led to remarkable
    savings in use of both water and electricity. The design can be further improved
    by attaching computer to the system as RS232 is given in the circuit. In case
    there''s an error in the system, the farmer can be informed by interfacing the
    system with DTMF Transceiver and hence place a call on the farmer''s mobile number.
    Also GSM module can be used to send a message to the farmer in case an error occurs.

    have become the main subjects of different studies in the last decades, due to
    their high influence on crop performance indicators. This study presents the most
    important parameters that have to be monitored in an irrigation management system
    and the most important ones are synthesized: air moisture and temperature, soil
    air and moisture, evapotranspiration. Based on the monitoring of these parameters,
    different control strategies and methods can be applied for optimization and efficiency
    of irrigation systems. The synthesis in this paper starts with classical control
    systems and, also, advanced methods such as fuzzy concept, decision support systems
    and model predictive control. Considering the currently necessity of integration
    into the Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) concept, the paper finally proposes an irrigation
    control system for vineyards. The SCADA architecture is suitable for the Romanian
    context, it allows flexibility and ease of use and it reduced both energy consumption
    and irrigation operation costs. Published in: 2017 9th IEEE International Conference

    IEEE Conference Location: Bucharest, Romania SECTION I. Introduction Irrigation
    quality is a crop performance indicator, its influence being realized both directly
    and indirectly. If we refer to the high quantity of water that crops need, we
    see it as a direct influence factor, as soon as its indirectly role could be seen
    in the influence on the other nutrients availability and on the timing of cultural
    operations. Irrigation requirements are very different from a region to another,
    thus energy efficiency and economic use of water resources depend on a function
    of soil and crop type, climate and moisture [20]. Many factors influence the potential
    water-use efficiency. The meaning of the word potential refers to the maximum
    water-use efficiency that can be achieved when the system is operated properly.
    Global temperature has increased with 0.2-0.3 [ºC] in the last 30 years. The growing
    season in viticulture is very influenced by high or low temperatures. [17] has
    shown that for a 1, 2 or 3 [ºC] rise of temperature, it will also be a crop water
    demand increase with 11%, 19% and even 29%. This paper presents an energy efficient
    proposed system for irrigation management in vineyards. To understand the system
    structure, section II presents the monitored parameters with a huge influence
    on crop productivity. Section III show the main advanced control methods currently
    used in irrigation management, due to the necessity of an advanced irrigation
    system able to manage the installation and receive alerts. The integrated automation
    and telemetry solution for irrigation management in precision agriculture considering
    criteria to energy efficiency and economics, along with the latest control technologies
    is proposed in section IV. SECTION II. Monitored Parameters in Irrigation Management
    Precision of measurements is of high importance in vineyards productivity, modern
    techniques frequently used is focused on the optimization of the oenological potential
    that vineyards have. Precision viticulture is characterized by a crop that is
    dependent of a specific region climate and soil type. This dependence expresses
    the weather influence in vineyards and some of the arguments that support this
    idea are: Daily temperature trend has a huge influence on the grape quality and,
    consequently, on wine [15]; Bunch temperature offers an information related to
    the phenolic compounds maturation [16]; Solar radiation has an impact on phenolic
    compound biosynthesis [18]. A. Air Moisture and Temperature Crop is certainly
    a function of temperature if water is available for optimum satisfaction [1].
    Temperature has a great influence on seeds germination. Due to the biochemical
    processes, the germination phases that include hydration and enzyme activation,
    its degradation and embryo growth are temperature dependent. Validated arguments
    that show the necessity of temperature monitoring are: From 5 to 37 [ºC], the
    rate of photosynthesis is doubled at every 10 [ºC] increase in temperature; The
    respiration rate becomes double at each 10 °C above the optimum temperature; The
    minimum threshold is the temperature below which no growth is possible. Relative
    humidity offers an information regarding the water vapor that is in the air, this
    parameter being in a strong dependence with temperature. Dew point temperature
    explains this dependence, because temperature goes down when the relative humidity
    increases and if the temperature gets cold enough, the air gets to the point in
    which it holds the highest quantity of water vapors. Due to these arguments, air
    moisture and temperature must be monitored in an irrigation management system.
    B. Soil Moisture and Temperature Soil is also very important in irrigation management
    as it is a major source of atmospheric C O 2 and a storage reservoir for carbon
    with soil moisture being a driving force. Some advantages of soil moisture monitoring
    are: The influence in temperature and weather forecasting, due to the fact that
    it has an rise of the evaporation rate that increases the temperature [3]; The
    increasement of the humidity caused by the evaporation rate of the soil moisture
    that increases the dew point; The dependence between temperature and precipitation.
    This is highlighted by the low pressure systems that will condense if air moisture
    is due to the soil moisture evaporation. The result is precipitation occurrence.
    Irrigation management is of high importance in a vineyard. In many regions, growers
    apply irrigations when soil moisture is above an established limit (for example
    50%). Soil moisture is also important because it indirectly influences irrigation
    (the water application and movement across the field, assuring the intake rate).
    The application rate depends of sprinkler and low-volume methods such as deep
    and micro-sprinkles that uses mechanical devices as nozzles [5]. Water that is
    lost by evaporation could be saved by an efficient irrigation appliance capable
    of reducing evaporation with 5 to 15 % depending of the frequency that is used.
    Irrigation without soil moisture monitoring is not indicated, due to the fact
    that this parameter has an influence in the balance between canopy size and fruitfulness
    [19]. The main objective of irrigation is to optimize the plant water stress and
    this could be done by an efficient soil moisture monitoring. The readings of soil
    moisture sensor are temperature dependent and field measured resistance needs
    correction when some differences appear between calibration and field measurements.
    Soil temperature monitoring is influenced in an important proportion by solar
    radiation and humidity. It is considered that soil temperature should be measured
    by sensors that have no moving parts and that do not need calibration. C. Evapotranspiration
    A very important parameter for crop growth and health is evapotranspiration. This
    irrigation management variable is computed based on weather information (air temperature
    and humidity, wind speed etc.). Explanation of the interdependence existing among
    evapotranspiration and meteorological data collected from on-site weather stations
    is offered by using Penman-Monteith method [13]. E T 0 = 0.408Δ( R n −G)+γ 900

    View Source SECTION III. Control Strategies for Irrigation Systems Based on the
    monitoring of several parameters, as seen in chapter II, different control strategies
    and methods can be applied for optimization and efficiency of irrigation systems.
    Different approaches can be used for designing the control strategy in drip irrigation
    systems: constant open-loop control, open loop on/off, feedback control, [23].
    A. Classical PID Control Classical control methods such as proportional, integral
    and derivative methods show good results, Fig. 1. Figure 1. Classical control
    system Show All In [21] a discrete PID controller is used to control an open irrigation
    channel. The actuator is the opening gate and the controller provides the signal
    for position of this gate. PID control is used in [22] in a modified manner, with
    a constrained integral function, and the goal is supplying the appropriate amount
    of water to meet the needs of the plant during the diurnal cycle. A diagram of
    the PID control for soil moisture in dripping irrigation system is presented in
    Fig. 2. The controller computes the command signal based on the error between
    the measured soil moisture from the transducer and the reference one. The actuator
    is represented by a control relay that acts on the water supply valve. Considering
    the varying solar radiation levels, the controller can still follow the soil moisture
    reference, which proved this classical method gives good results. Figure 2. Soil
    moisture PID control Show All B. Fuzzy Control Systems Fuzzy control is a strategy
    used for irrigation management considering several controlled parameters: soil
    moisture, water supply, loss minimization etc. The general architecture for fuzzy
    control of soil humidity is presented in [24], Fig. 3. The water supply is assured
    through a reservoir house height acts as actuating variable h . The soil moisture
    error is the difference between measured soil moisture and the reference one.
    The system has a variable reference depending on the stage of growth of the plant.
    Figure 3. Fuzzy control architecture Show All The soil humidity error''s membership
    function assignment, which is of high importance in fuzzy control, is based on
    the rule that the higher sensitivity membership for little error and the fine
    stability membership for larger error. Totally, there were 16 fuzzy rules in this
    system. C. Decision Support Systems In [6], a decision support system (DSS) is
    proposed for water supply prediction and control. This system collects data from
    a specific weather station. Then, collected data and weather predictions from
    three different sources are analyzed and the result is an evapotranspiration prediction
    and an estimation of plant daily development forecast for the next 10 days. A
    water distribution planning solution is proposed in [8] for irrigation in an arid
    district. Optimal water delivery scheduling for irrigation canals is implemented
    through a DSS system. The DSS structure consists of a water demand module, a supply
    module and a planning module, Fig. 4. Figure 4. DSS architecture for water supply
    scheduling, [8] Show All D. Model Predictive Control Model predictive control
    (MPC) approach is common used in industry offering a number of features: is robust
    against uncertainty system constraints can be handled is easy to accomplish tuning
    is used in multivariable control applications In MPC control strategy the future
    evolution control sequence of the system is determined based on system model by
    minimizing a cost function. The cost function is obtained by minimizing the deviation
    from set points over the prediction horizon, Fig. 5. Figure 5. MPC control Show
    All In [25] a Model Predictive Control framework for real-time irrigation scheduling
    is developed. A state space formulation of the water balance model is developed.
    The accuracy of the water balance approach is affected by uncertain measurements,
    such as evapotranspiration and precipitation and constraints such as limited water.
    The soil moisture deficit set-point tracking is accomplished by the MPC controller.
    The MPC controller also incorporates input and output constraints. The controller
    successfully tracks the commanded set-point as well as meets the constraints.
    SECTION IV. Proposed System for Irrigation Control in Vineyards Irrigation control
    strategies should be integrated in complex automation and telemetry systems. There
    are several such systems in the world, adapted on specific crops and weather.
    Two of the implemented irrigation management systems are presented further. The
    Advanced Scientific Irrigation Management application is a complex SCADA systems
    used for optimization irrigation in an arid district in USA, [6]. In order to
    implement the irrigation program, it is used a 6 six days sample code for each
    of the 369 parcels. Then, code is transferred to the SCADA master system which
    controls the 93 RTU stations by radio communications. Irrigation channels are
    controlled by a Decision Support System (DSS), as described in section III. Advantages
    of this system should be summarized as the overcome of water infiltrations, water
    costs, water-supply shortages, some specific irrigation issues. In [7] an implementation
    of an automated irrigation system, installed in Australia is presented. Efficiency
    of the irrigation system can be improved by an information infrastructure including
    sensors, actuators and supervisory control and data acquisition communication
    network. The task of the supervisory control is to ensure that the physical flow
    capacities are not exceeded. An irrigation system model is constructed based on
    the interconnection of the individual pool models. In order to achieve an entire
    irrigation system under closed loop control where water orders are met in real
    time on demand, the research and development effort has focused on controlling
    water quantity and quality in open channels. Due to knowledge and existing technologies
    in the third wave of the information processing, communication and computing,
    a new telemetry system for precision agriculture should be integrated into the
    Cyber-Physical System (CPS) concept. The CPS paradigm has two connotations. On
    the one hand, it solves the issues related to the way in which inquiry is done,
    whereas the second one is a model that underpins all specific states of the components
    of the process [4]. Considering the analysis on the control systems implemented
    over the world and the specific conditions in the Romanian context, an energy
    efficient irrigation system for water supply control in vineyards is proposed,
    Fig. 6. The irrigation management system for the precision agriculture could be
    seen as a MIMO system. The control strategy follows a fuzzy approach and it considers
    soil moisture control and the disturbances can be air temperature and evapotranspiration,
    as it is a plant disease indictor. Thus, the system must be fully interconnected
    and decentralized, being equipped with the following: One or more telemetry stations
    that establish the irrigation necessity. Considering the arguments exposed in
    the 2nd paragraph, it is of highly importance to have sensors for air and soil
    temperature, air and soil humidity and evapotranspiration computation, [26]. With
    these parameters, they could be calculated the precipitations necessity and the
    irrigations efficiency. A SCADA system (a SCADA master and clients) that receives
    all information from process and, using some specific decision algorithms, sends
    commands to actuators. It must be done a software application that collects and
    processes data from sensors and that has the capability of displaying it in a
    logical format. The main characteristics that a SCADA system for irrigation management
    must have are presented in Fig. 7. A RTU (Remote Terminal Unit) that includes
    solar panels and batteries for independent operation is used for acquisition of
    other field parameters and actuators control. The actuators consist of pumps,
    valves and other Figure 6. Proposed irrigation control system Show All Figure
    7. Main characteristics of the SCADA system in irrigation management Show All
    SECTION V. Conclusions Irrigation management systems should be focused on the
    adequate supply of water in order to increase crop productivity. This study focuses
    at first on the main parameters that must be monitored in an irrigation management
    system to discover the advantages and effects of their control. Both soil and
    air moisture and temperature are monitored with specific measurement probes and
    evapotranspiration can be calculated using Penman-Monteith, Priestley-Taylor or
    Makkink method. The control strategies for irrigation systems are classified into
    4 categories, from classical to new trends equipment that operate directly to
    irrigate the vineyards. All these are chosen for energy efficiency of the system,
    but also for efficient water management. in irrigation control: PID control, fuzzy
    control systems, decision support systems for water supply prediction and control
    and model predictive control. The main contribution of the paper is the proposal
    of an irrigation control system for vineyards, from a Cyber-Physical Systems perspective.
    The SCADA architecture allows a CPS approach and the fuzzy control strategy is
    suitable for the Romanian context. Based on the high quality of measurements,
    the system computes the water supply necessity based on a fuzzy controller. The
    communication system based on GSM modules at the field level brigs flexibility
    and ease of use for the telemetry and automation system. The system architecture
    has many other benefits such as low energy consumption, low administration costs
    and forecasting and diagnosis functions. ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work was supported

  explanation: 'Closed-loop control is used in engineering to control a system by
    continuously measuring the output and comparing it to the desired output. In this
    context, closed-loop control is used to ensure that the system is operating as
    desired and to make any necessary adjustments to the system.


    In the specific case of autonomous irrigation systems, closed-loop control can
    be used to adjust the amount of water that is applied to a field based on the
    soil moisture levels. This can help to ensure that the plants receive the right
    amount of water, which can lead to increased yields and reduced water usage.


    Closed-loop control can also be used to adjust the timing of irrigation based
    on the weather forecast. This can help to prevent overwatering or under watering,
    which can both lead to reduced yields.


    Overall, closed-loop control can be a valuable tool for improving the eﬃciency
    and precision of autonomous irrigation systems.'

    \ technology (VRT); AI\n1. Introduction\nThe agriculture sector is undergoing\
    \ a transformation driven by new technologies, which seems\nvery promising as\
    \ it will enable this primary sector to move to the next level of farm productivity\n\
    and proﬁtability [1]. Precision Agriculture, which consist of applying inputs\
    \ (what is needed) when\nand where is needed, has become the third wave of the\
    \ modern agriculture revolution (the ﬁrst was\nmechanization and the second the\
    \ green revolution with its genetic modiﬁcation [2]), and nowadays,\nit is being\
    \ enhanced with an increase of farm knowledge systems due to the availability\
    \ of larger\namounts of data. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)\
    \ already reported in October\n2016 that Precision Agriculture technologies increased\
    \ net returns and operating proﬁts [3]. Also,\nwhen considering the environment,\
    \ new technologies are increasingly being applied in the farms\nto maintain the\
    \ sustainability of farm production. However, the adoption of these technologies\n\
    involves uncertainty and trade-oﬀs. According to a market analysis, the factors\
    \ that would facilitate\nthe adoption of sustainable farming technologies include\
    \ better education and training of farmers,\nsharing of information, easy availability\
    \ of ﬁnancial resources, and increasing consumer demand\nfor organic food [4].\
    \ When applying these new technologies, the challenge for retrieving data from\n\
    crops is to come out with something coherent and valuable, because data themselves\
    \ are not useful,\njust numbers or images. Farms that decide to be technology-driven\
    \ in some way, show valuable\nadvantages, such us saving money and work, having\
    \ an increased production or a reduction of costs\nwith minimal eﬀort, and producing\
    \ quality food with more environmentally friendly practices [5].\nHowever, taking\
    \ these advantages to the farm will depend, not only on the willingness of producers\n\

    Agronomy 2020, 10, 207\n2 of 21\nfor adopting new technologies in their ﬁelds,\
    \ but also on each speciﬁc farm potential in terms of scale\neconomies, as proﬁt\
    \ margin increases with farm size. The USDA reported that, on average, corn\n\
    farm operating proﬁt of Precision Agriculture adopters was 163 dollars per hectare\
    \ higher than for\nnon-adopters, taking into account that the highest adoption\
    \ rates for three technologies (computer\nmapping, guidance, and variable-rate\
    \ equipment) were on farms over 1500 hectares [3]. Such margins\ncan even go up\
    \ to 272 dollars depending on the crop. A greater use of Smart Farming services\
    \ is vital\nto not only improving a farm’s ﬁnancial performance, but also to meet\
    \ the food needs of an expanding\npopulation [6].\nThe ﬁnal purpose of this paper\
    \ is to demonstrate how making decisions with the modern\ndata-based agriculture\
    \ available today can lead to sustainable and proﬁtable actuation to nourish\n\
    people while reducing harm to the environment. In order to evaluate how modern\
    \ agriculture can help\nin a sustainable decision-making process, this article\
    \ revisits the main steps of an information-based\nagriculture and focuses on\
    \ data management systems by reviewing recent applications related to each\ncrucial\
    \ step, from data acquisition in crop ﬁelds to the execution of tasks with variable\
    \ rate equipment.\n2. Data-Driven Agriculture: Agriculture 4.0\nThis new philosophy\
    \ centered on agricultural data has been expressed with several names:\nAgriculture\
    \ 4.0, Digital Farming, or Smart Farming, and was born when telematics and data\
    \ management\nwere combined to the already known concept of Precision Agriculture,\
    \ improving the accuracy of\noperations [7]. As a result, Agriculture 4.0 is based\
    \ on Precision Agriculture principles with producers\nusing systems that generate\
    \ data in their farms, which will be processed in such a way to make proper\n\
    strategical and operational decisions. Traditionally, farmers have gone to the\
    \ ﬁelds to check the status\nof their crops and make decisions based on their\
    \ accumulated experience. This approach is no longer\nsustainable as, among other\
    \ reasons, some ﬁelds are too large to be eﬃciently managed according to\nthe\
    \ threefold criteria that will lead the coming years: Eﬃciency, sustainability\
    \ and availability (for\npeople). Advanced management systems within the context\
    \ of Smart Farming are providing practical\nsolutions. Also, despite some farmers\
    \ have a long-time experience gathered after many years of work\nin the ﬁeld,\
    \ technology may provide a systematic tool to detect unforeseen problems hard\
    \ to notice\nby visual inspection on occasional checks. Regarding the willingness\
    \ of adopting modern tools in\nagriculture, young farmers show a more positive\
    \ attitude than elder ones, as the former can support\ntheir not-so-large experience\
    \ in the ﬁeld with new smart tools providing key information. However,\nthe average\
    \ age of farmers in the last decades has been alarmingly increasing: Around 58\
    \ years old in\nthe USA and Europe, 60 in sub-Saharan Africa, or 63 in Japan [8,9].\
    \ Fortunately, this trend is expected\nto change. Several European policies, for\
    \ example, are being set to support a generational renewal,\nfacilitating access\
    \ to initial investment, loans, business advice, and training [9]. A generational\
    \ renewal\nin a rural development context goes beyond a reduction in the average\
    \ age of farmers; it is also about\nempowering a new generation of highly qualiﬁed\
    \ young farmers to bring the full beneﬁts of technology\nin order to support sustainable\
    \ farming practices [10]. This implies that young farmers will need to\ntransform\
    \ the existing land to more modern and competitive farms with the purpose of maintaining\n\
    viable food production while improving the competitiveness of the agrifood chain,\
    \ because with\nadvanced technologies and new thinking, young people can transform\
    \ the agricultural sector [8].\n2.1. Internet of Things: Collecting Information\n\
    Internet of things (IoT) in an agricultural context refers to the use of sensors\
    \ and other devices to\nturn every element and action involved in farming into\
    \ data. It has been reported that an estimation\nof a 10% to 15% of US farmers\
    \ are using IoT solutions on the farm across 1200 million hectares and\n250,000\
    \ farms [11]. IoT drives Agriculture 4.0 [12]; in fact, IoT technologies is one\
    \ of the reasons why\nagriculture can generate such a big amount of valuable information,\
    \ and the agriculture sector is\nexpected to be highly inﬂuenced by the advances\
    \ in these technologies [13]. It is estimated that, with\nnew techniques, the\
    \ IoT has the potential to increase agricultural productivity by 70% by 2050 [14],\n\
    Agronomy 2020, 10, 207\n3 of 21\nwhich is positive, because according to Myklevy\
    \ et al., the world needs to increase global food\nproduction by 60% by 2050 due\
    \ to a population growth over nine thousand million [15]. The main\nadvantages\
    \ of the use of IoT are achieving higher crop yields and less cost. For example,\
    \ studies from\nOnFarm found that for an average farm using IoT, yield rises by\
    \ 1.75% and energy costs drop 17 to\n32 dollars per hectare, while water use for\
    \ irrigation falls by 8% [12].\n2.2. Big Data: Analysis of Massive Data\nIn the\
    \ current technology-based era, the concept of big data is present in many economic\
    \ sectors,\nbut is it already available to agriculture?\nThe ever-growing amount\
    \ of data available for ﬁeld\nmanagement makes necessary the implementation of\
    \ some type of automatic process to extract\noperational information from bulk\
    \ data. However, the volume of data currently retrieved from most\ncommercial\
    \ ﬁelds is, arguably, not yet at the level considered to be classiﬁed as big data.\
    \ According to\nManyica et al. [16], big data has three dimensions: Volume, velocity,\
    \ and variety. Kunisch [17] added a\nfourth V for veracity. Finally, a ﬁfth V\
    \ was added by Chi et al. for the extra dimension valorization [18].\nOverall,\
    \ the ﬁve V (dimensions) of big data stand for:\n•\nVolume refers to datasets\
    \ whose size is beyond the ability of typical database software tools to\ncapture,\
    \ store, manage, and analyze information. This deﬁnition includes an estimate\
    \ of how big\na dataset needs to be in order to be considered big, and it can\
    \ vary by study sector, depending on\nsoftware tools that are commonly available\
    \ and common sizes of datasets, typically starting in the\nterabyte range [16].\n\
    •\nVelocity refers to the capability to acquire, understand and interpret events\
    \ as they occur.\nIn agriculture, this would refer to applications that occur\
    \ in real time, like data being processed\nright in the ﬁeld to apply variable\
    \ rates of chemicals in equipment featuring variable rate\napplication technologies.\n\
    •\nVariety refers to the diﬀerent data formats (videos, text, voice), and the\
    \ diverse degrees of\ncomplexity. This situation is not strange in agriculture\
    \ when diﬀerent data sources are used to\nwork in complex scenarios such as images\
    \ and soil or weather probes.\n•\nVeracity refers to the quality, reliability,\
    \ and overall conﬁdence of the data.\n•\nValorization is the ability to propagate\
    \ knowledge, appreciation and innovation [18].\nIn the context of crop management,\
    \ Kunisch [17] concluded that big data is applicable only in\nsome cases in agriculture,\
    \ depending on each farm and its level of technology adoption. Nevertheless,\n\
    the Proagrica [19] report conﬁrmed that big data was being increasingly applied\
    \ in the agriculture\nsector. Kamilaris et al. [18] cited 34 works where big data\
    \ was used in agricultural applications, and\nWolfert et al. [20] published a\
    \ review on big data applications in Smart Farming. In line with this\ntrend,\
    \ the Consortium of International Agricultural Research Centers (CGIAR, Montpellier,\
    \ France)\ncreated a Platform for Big Data in Agriculture with the purpose of\
    \ using big data approaches to solve\nagricultural development problems faster,\
    \ better, and at a greater scale than before [21].\n2.3. Agriculture 5.0: Robotics\
    \ and Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) to Help in Nourishing People\nBig engineering\
    \ challenges typically spur big solutions through disruptive technologies,\nand\
    \ Agriculture 5.0 is probably the one for the ﬁrst half of the 21st Century. The\
    \ concept Agriculture\n5.0 implies that farms are following Precision Agriculture\
    \ principles and using equipment that involves\nunmanned operations and autonomous\
    \ decision support systems. Thus, Agriculture 5.0 implies the use\nof robots and\
    \ some forms of AI [22]. By tradition, farms have needed many workers, mostly\
    \ seasonal,\nto harvest crops and keep farms productive. However, society has\
    \ moved away from being an agrarian\nsociety with large quantities of people living\
    \ in farms to people living in cities now; as a result, farms\nare facing the\
    \ challenge of a workforce shortage. One solution to help with this shortage of\
    \ workers is\nagricultural robots integrating AI features. According to a Forbes\
    \ study [23], farm robots augment\nthe human labor workforce and can harvest crops\
    \ at a higher volume and faster pace than human\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 207\n4 of\
    \ 21\nlaborers. Although there are still many cases in which robots are not as\
    \ fast as humans, agriculture is\ncurrently developing robotic systems to work\
    \ in the ﬁeld and help producers with tedious tasks [24–27],\npushing agricultural\
    \ systems to the new concept of Agriculture 5.0. According to Reddy et al. [28],\n\
    the advent of robots in agriculture drastically increased the productivity in\
    \ several countries and\nreduced the farm operating costs. As said before, robotic\
    \ applications for agriculture are growing\nexponentially [27], which oﬀers promising\
    \ solutions for Smart Farming in handling labor shortage and\na long-time declining\
    \ proﬁtability; however, like most innovations, there exist important limitations\n\
    to cope with at the current early stages. These technologies are still too expensive\
    \ for most farmers,\nespecially those with small farms [29], because scale economics\
    \ make small individual farms less\nproﬁtable [30]. Nevertheless, the cost of\
    \ technology decreases with time, and agricultural robots will be\nsurely implemented\
    \ in the future as the alternative to bring about higher production [4,31]. The\
    \ world\nagricultural production and crop yields slowed down in 2015. The concept\
    \ of agricultural robotics\nwas introduced to overcome these problems and satisfy\
    \ the rising demand for high yields. Robotic\ninnovations are giving a boost to\
    \ the global agriculture and crop production market, as according to\nthe Veriﬁed\
    \ Market Intelligence report, agricultural robots will be capable of completing\
    \ ﬁeld tasks\nwith greater eﬃciency as compared to the farmers [32].\nAgricultural\
    \ tech startups have raised over 800 million dollars in the last ﬁve years [31].\
    \ Startups\nusing robotics and machine learning to solve problems in agriculture\
    \ started gaining momentum in\n2014, in line with a rising interest in AI [33].\
    \ In fact, venture capital funding in AI has increased by 450%\nin the last 5\
    \ years [34]. This kind of new agriculture pretends to do more with less, because\
    \ nourishing\npeople while increasing production sustainably and taking care of\
    \ the environment will be crucial in\nthe coming years, as the Food and Agriculture\
    \ Organization of the United Nations (FAO) estimates\nthat, in 2050, there will\
    \ be a world population of 9.6 billion [35]. Advanced sensing technologies in\n\
    agriculture can help to meet the challenge; they provide detailed information\
    \ on soil, crop status,\nand environmental conditions to allow precise applications\
    \ of phytosanitary products, resulting in a\nreduced used of herbicides and pesticides,\
    \ improved water use eﬃciency and increased crop yield and\nquality [2].\n3. Data-Driven\
    \ Management for Advanced Farming: Principal Stages\nThe raw measurements of key\
    \ parameters from crops need to be eﬃciently processed so that\nnumbers or images\
    \ unambiguously turn into valuable information. Crop management based on ﬁeld\n\
    data already evolved when Precision Agriculture came to light thirty years ago,\
    \ but it has certainly\nbeen transformed by the present digital information era.\
    \ Traditionally, and in those places where\ntechnology has not arrived yet, ﬁeld\
    \ management consists of visually inspecting the development of\ncrops to reach\
    \ a diagnosis with which farmers make decisions and actuate giving diﬀerent treatments\n\
    to their crops. This approach relies on ﬁeld experience and the information perceived\
    \ through the\neyes of farmers. Additionally, associated growers can follow the\
    \ recommendations of cooperative\ntechnicians or engineers hired by the society\
    \ they belong to. In farms where advanced technology\nhas been implemented, ﬁeld\
    \ management varies according to the operating cycle shown in Figure 1.\nThis\
    \ management system based on objective ﬁeld data and smart decision-making starts\
    \ with the actual\ncrop to manage, taking advantage of its inner variability,\
    \ both spatial-wise and time-wise. The platform\nrefers to the physical means\
    \ with which information is acquired, being the sensors the speciﬁc elements\n\
    through which objective data are obtained. Data includes the information directly\
    \ retrieved from the\nparameters measured from the crop, soil, or ambient. Retrieving\
    \ the data from the sensors can be done\nin multiple ways, from inserting a pen\
    \ drive in a USB port to get the ﬁles [36] to retrieving data from\nsoftware applications\
    \ synchronized to the Internet. The nexus between the data and the decision stage\n\
    involves ﬁltering routines and AI algorithms for getting only the right data and\
    \ helping the grower\nmake correct decisions. Finally, actuation refers to the\
    \ physical execution of an action commanded by\nthe decision system, and is typically\
    \ carried out by advanced equipment that can receive orders from\na computerized\
    \ control unit. As each action takes place over the crop, the cycle starts and\
    \ closes at\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 207\n5 of 21\ncrop level; the response of the\
    \ crop is then registered by specialized sensors and the loop continues\nsystematically\
    \ until harvesting time, which marks the end of the crop life cycle.\nAgronomy\

    \ of the Agricultural Management Cycle—Analyzing \nVariability \nRegardless how\
    \ the crop will be managed, some degree of spatial variability is assumed for\
    \ all \nfields by nature. According to Searcy [37], natural variability is influenced\
    \ by weather within a \ngrowing season and from year to year; then, data from\
    \ several years may be needed to determine \ntrends in the parameters of interest,\
    \ and hence, data becomes a regular input to the farm management \nsystem. Therefore,\
    \ the necessity of monitoring crops comes from the existence of variability, but\
    \ there \nis a need for the producer to manage that variability in a feasible\
    \ way, and the widely accepted way \nto do it is by setting within-field management\
    \ zones. Management zones are subfield areas that have \nhomogeneous features,\
    \ so field practices can be custom-made to each of such areas, resulting in a\
    \ \npractical and cost-effective approach to Precision Agriculture [41]. The adoption\
    \ of management \nzones would reduce the cost of fertilizing, improve crop yields,\
    \ reduce the usage of pesticides, \nprovide better farm records that are essential\
    \ for sale, and provide better information for \nmanagement decisions [4]. According\
    \ to Zhang et al. [38], the number of management zones is a \nfunction of the\
    \ natural variability within the field, the size of the field and certain management\
    \ \nfactors. If the variability is high, the minimum size of a zone is limited\
    \ by the possibility of each \nfarmer to differentially manage regions within\
    \ a field in economic and logistics terms. In addition to \ndecide the area of\
    \ working zones, the selection of the specific parameters to be tracked within\
    \ those \nzones must be carefully made early in the process. Rovira-Más and Saiz-Rubio\

    3.1. Stage I: The Crop as the Beginning and End of the Agricultural Management\
    \ Cycle—Analyzing Variability\nRegardless how the crop will be managed, some degree\
    \ of spatial variability is assumed for all\nﬁelds by nature. According to Searcy\
    \ [37], natural variability is inﬂuenced by weather within a growing\nseason and\
    \ from year to year; then, data from several years may be needed to determine\
    \ trends in\nthe parameters of interest, and hence, data becomes a regular input\
    \ to the farm management system.\nTherefore, the necessity of monitoring crops\
    \ comes from the existence of variability, but there is a need\nfor the producer\
    \ to manage that variability in a feasible way, and the widely accepted way to\
    \ do it is by\nsetting within-ﬁeld management zones. Management zones are subﬁeld\
    \ areas that have homogeneous\nfeatures, so ﬁeld practices can be custom-made\
    \ to each of such areas, resulting in a practical and\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 207\n\
    6 of 21\ncost-eﬀective approach to Precision Agriculture [41]. The adoption of\
    \ management zones would reduce\nthe cost of fertilizing, improve crop yields,\
    \ reduce the usage of pesticides, provide better farm records\nthat are essential\
    \ for sale, and provide better information for management decisions [4]. According\n\
    to Zhang et al. [38], the number of management zones is a function of the natural\
    \ variability within\nthe ﬁeld, the size of the ﬁeld and certain management factors.\
    \ If the variability is high, the minimum\nsize of a zone is limited by the possibility\
    \ of each farmer to diﬀerentially manage regions within a\nﬁeld in economic and\
    \ logistics terms. In addition to decide the area of working zones, the selection\
    \ of\nthe speciﬁc parameters to be tracked within those zones must be carefully\
    \ made early in the process.\nRovira-Más and Saiz-Rubio [65] classiﬁed crop biometric\
    \ traits in a tri-level division of crop features\ndepending on the focus of interest\
    \ being at soil level, plant level, or produce level. This division\nallowed the\
    \ superimposition of various layers in a standardized map with the aim of determining\
    \ a\ndata-based wine quality index deﬁned as the Quality Potential Index (QPI)\
    \ for each subﬁeld area in a\nvineyard. Nevertheless, there may be speciﬁc cases\
    \ where the spatial variability of a ﬁeld is so low that\na single mapping event\
    \ can be suﬃcient, as reported by Klassen et al. [42] when characterizing soil\n\
    variability in rice ﬁelds.\n3.2. Stage II: Platforms Supporting Sensors\nSensors\
    \ are the universal devices to monitor crops and to obtain objective information\
    \ from them.\nThey are usually integrated in a platform, which is the general\
    \ term used in Figure 1 to name the\nstructures where sensors are placed and carried.\
    \ These platforms may be attached to oﬀ-road vehicles\nor ﬁxed to the ground within\
    \ ﬁelds such as local weather stations. One of the most urgent challenges to\n\
    cope with in the next few years will be getting a wider range of non-invasive\
    \ sensors able to measure\non-the-go. This approach would be closer to Agriculture\
    \ 5.0, as these sensors could be attached to\nautonomous platforms and robots.\
    \ Nowadays, not all the parameters of interest can be measured\nnon-invasively\
    \ and at a distance from the target; however, some technologies such as multispectral\
    \ or\nhyperspectral imaging are making signiﬁcant improvements.\n3.2.1. Remote\
    \ Sensing Platforms: Satellites\nRemote sensing has played a key role in the progress\
    \ of Smart Farming when ﬁeld data became\ngenerally accessible from artiﬁcial\
    \ satellites. Important satellites providing agricultural information are\nthe\
    \ American Landsat satellites (eight satellites take spectral data from the Earth\
    \ each 16 to 18 days),\nthe European Sentinel 2 satellite system (it provides\
    \ multispectral data at 10 m pixel resolution for\nNDVI—Normalized Diﬀerence Vegetation\
    \ Index—imagery, soil, and water cover every ten days), the\nRapidEye constellation\
    \ (ﬁve satellites provide multispectral RGB imagery, as well as red-edge and NIR\n\
    bands at 5 m resolution), the GeoEye-1 system (captures multispectral RGB data\
    \ and NIR data at a\n1.84 m resolution), and the WorldView-3 (collects multispectral\
    \ data from the RGB bands including\nthe red-edge, two NIR bands, and 8 SWIR bands\
    \ with a resolution of 1.24 m at nadir). IKONOS\nand QuickBird have been already\
    \ decommissioned. There exist several reviews on satellite sensing\napplications,\
    \ having recent studies focused on the potential applications of thermal technologies\
    \ using\nremote sensing [44] and nutritional status in commodity crops [45].\n\
    3.2.2. Aircraft Systems\nThe distance between crops and satellites is considerable,\
    \ typically around 700 km, and deeper\ninsights are reachable when sensors remain\
    \ closer to the targets. For aircraft systems, the distance\nto land can be around\
    \ 100 m. For example, there is a legal limit of 120 m above the ground in Spain\n\
    for unmanned ﬂying vehicles. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and remotely-piloted\
    \ aircrafts (RPA)\ncan basically be of two kinds: Fixed-wing aircrafts and multirotor\
    \ aircrafts. Rotary-wing UAVs are\nmore stable ﬂiers as they are capable of a\
    \ vertical take-oﬀ and landing; however, they are slower and\ncannot cover as\
    \ much area during their battery life. Fixed-wing platforms, on the other hand,\
    \ can cover\nmore area per ﬂight and carry larger payloads, but tend to be more\
    \ expensive and break more easily\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 207\n7 of 21\nafter multiple\
    \ landings [45]. When compared to remote sensing, the advantages of UAVs for Precision\n\
    Agriculture are their ﬂexibility in frequency (revisit time of satellites) and\
    \ better spatial resolutions.\nWhen compared to ground vehicles, UAVs can get\
    \ data from inaccessible places where conventional\nequipment cannot stand; however,\
    \ they require a professional planning of the ﬂight route beforehand,\nand certain\
    \ machine vision applications may require ﬂying at midday to avoid vegetation\
    \ shadows\non the ground causing errors with imagery data. Furthermore, post processing\
    \ the data and image\nmosaicking is often quite challenging. An important disadvantage\
    \ of UAVs is the limited payload\nthey can carry, which often limits the suite\
    \ of sensors onboard, as well as the incapacity of ﬂying with\nstrong wind.\n\
    3.2.3. Proximal Sensing: Ground Autonomous Systems—the Great Push for Agriculture\
    \ 5.0\nWhen monitoring platforms operate from the ground, the distance from the\
    \ sensors to the target\ncrop diminishes to less than 2 m. Due to the proximity\
    \ of the sensor to the plant, when data is acquired\nfrom ground-based platforms,\
    \ it is called proximal sensing. Ground vehicles are polyvalent in relation\n\
    to the payload of sensors. As these vehicles move near the crop, the data acquired\
    \ increase in accuracy,\nand resolutions of one or more samples per meter are\
    \ feasible, being only limited by the speciﬁcations\nof the particular sensors\
    \ implemented. When active sensors are used, weather conditions such as\nstrong\
    \ sunlight or poor illumination are not a serious problem anymore, and, in case\
    \ of on-the-ﬂy\nprocessing, real-time applications are possible, as spraying weeds\
    \ with the previous detection of the\npest [47]. There has been a signiﬁcant impulse\
    \ in the last ﬁve years for the particular case where data is\nretrieved from\
    \ an autonomous platform (unmanned ground vehicle or UGV) [48–52]. Aravind et\
    \ al. [48]\nreviewed ground robots for tilling, soil analysis, seeding, transplanting,\
    \ crop scouting, pest control,\nweed removal and harvesting, where crop scouting\
    \ has been deﬁned as the process of continuously\nmonitoring the ﬁeld to acquire\
    \ information on the plant status, disease incidence, and infestations\naﬀecting\
    \ crop growth. Shamshiri et al. [27] described recent achievements of UGVs for\
    \ weed control,\nﬁeld scouting, and harvesting, highlighting that, if successfully\
    \ integrated and implemented, ﬁeld\nscouting robots can play a key role in reducing\
    \ production cost, increasing productivity and quality,\nand enabling customized\
    \ plant and crop treatments. The European Commission (EC) has recently\nbacked\
    \ the relevance of robotic technology for Smart Farming by funding four projects\
    \ involving the\nconstruction of UGVs for advanced vineyard management: VineRobot,\
    \ Vinbot, GRAPE, and VineScout.\nIn 2016, the European project VineRobot [53]\
    \ delivered a monitoring robot prototype at a Technology\nReadiness Level (TRL)\
    \ status between 6 and 7 (TRL1 represents an early stage concept and TRL9\nis\
    \ a solution ready for production), paving the path for its conceptual termination\
    \ in the VineScout\nproject [54]. The 2019 version of VineScout is shown in Figure\
    \ 2. This robot is autonomously driven\nwhen monitoring vineyards with the assistance\
    \ of local perception sensors (stereo camera, lidar and\nultrasound sensors) for\
    \ navigation and safeguarding. It gathers data from the canopy of the vines with\n\
    the goal of creating plant water status maps and nutritional status maps. In order\
    \ to accomplish its\nmission in a reasonable timeframe, established by end-users\
    \ at a rate of 6 ha per day, this robot monitors\nvine canopies non-invasively,\
    \ which implies several challenges. Regarding hardware, fast and robust\nsensors\
    \ were set to work non-invasively and in motion, while having a cost-eﬃcient price\
    \ for the\nagriculture sector. Regarding software, the challenge was the agile\
    \ integration of all the crop-sensing\ndevices and the multi-season ground-truth\
    \ validation of the models developed in the ﬁeld.\nIn addition to scouting robots,\
    \ the introduction of robotics to the farm is also being led by industry\non speciﬁc\
    \ agricultural tasks. Naïo Technologies, for instance, has developed robot Oz\
    \ for mechanical\nweeding [55], and the autonomous sprayer GUSS received the Davidson\
    \ Prize in 2019 [56]. RowBot\nSystems LLC (Minneapolis, MN, USA) patented a robotic\
    \ platform whose structure was conﬁgured\nto perform several ﬁeld tasks, as selectively\
    \ applying fertilizer, mapping growth zones, or seeding\ncover crop [57]. Over\
    \ the 20th century, farm productivity has been increasing by augmenting the\n\
    size of machines, which has led to heavy and oversized equipment. In order to\
    \ invert this trend,\nresearchers and growers have started to think about alternatives\
    \ to tractors to avoid soil compaction.\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 207\n8 of 21\nShamshiri\
    \ et al. [27] suggested using various machines instead of one heavy machine. In\
    \ the same\nline, Hameed [58] proposed a technology that enabled a single farmer\
    \ to control a team of automated\nvehicles, and Ball et al. [59] used cooperative\
    \ robots as a measure to control weeds. In fact, there\nhave been several projects\
    \ implementing more than one machine operating in collaborative work,\nas the\
    \ Flourish European project that combines UAVs and UGVs to retrieve information\
    \ for decision\nsupport [46], or the RHEA project where a ﬂeet of autonomous robot\
    \ units performed treatments in\ncrops [82].\n \nfunding four projects involving\
    \ the construction of UGVs for advanced vineyard management: \nVineRobot, Vinbot,\
    \ GRAPE, and VineScout. In 2016, the European project VineRobot [53] delivered\
    \ \na monitoring robot prototype at a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) status\
    \ between 6 and 7 (TRL1 \nrepresents an early stage concept and TRL9 is a solution\
    \ ready for production), paving the path for \nits conceptual termination in the\
    \ VineScout project [54]. The 2019 version of VineScout is shown in \nFigure 2.\
    \ This robot is autonomously driven when monitoring vineyards with the assistance\
    \ of local \nperception sensors (stereo camera, lidar and ultrasound sensors)\
    \ for navigation and safeguarding. It \ngathers data from the canopy of the vines\
    \ with the goal of creating plant water status maps and \nnutritional status maps.\
    \ In order to accomplish its mission in a reasonable timeframe, established by\
    \ \nend-users at a rate of 6 ha per day, this robot monitors vine canopies non-invasively,\
    \ which implies \nseveral challenges. Regarding hardware, fast and robust sensors\
    \ were set to work non-invasively and \nin motion, while having a cost-efficient\
    \ price for the agriculture sector. Regarding software, the \nchallenge was the\
    \ agile integration of all the crop-sensing devices and the multi-season ground-truth\
    \ \nvalidation of the models developed in the field. \n \n \n(a) \n(b) \nFigure\

    \ and modern farming is, apart from the\nmechanization level, the data collected\
    \ directly from the crops. In traditional farms where growers\njudge by visual\
    \ assessment, decisions are relative and subjective. Modern farming oﬀers assessment\n\
    by quantitative data producing objective decisions. Sensors allow data acquisition\
    \ in the ﬁeld, but\nthe special case of non-invasive technologies in combination\
    \ with on-the-ﬂy sensing from moving\nplatforms has opened the window of massive\
    \ data collection, a forerunner of big data in agriculture.\nHowever, the excess\
    \ of data is also a serious challenge to cope with, as vital information may result\n\
    masked by noise. The NDVI measurements collected for plotting the maps of Figure\
    \ 3 [94] were\ncollected with two sensors working simultaneously (SRS sensors,\
    \ METER Group, Inc., Pullman, WA,\nUSA) and placed in the robot of Figure 2. One\
    \ of the sensors pointed to the sky and corrected NDVI\nestimates with the incident\
    \ light from the sun, and the other sensor pointed sidewise to the canopy\nto\
    \ collect data from the leaves at an approximate distance of 0.5 m. The zenithal\
    \ photo inserted on\nthe bottom-right corner of Figure 3a shows the VineScout\
    \ autonomous robot taking data between\ntwo rows in a vineyard. The onboard algorithm\
    \ averaged individual local measurements of NDVI in\nsquare cells of 16 m2 classiﬁed\
    \ into nine NDVI levels between 0 and 1 (Figure 3a). The grid map of\nFigure 3a,\
    \ despite informative, is not operational, so a further simpliﬁcation of data\
    \ is necessary before\na grower may ﬁnd it useful. Figure 3b is the result of\
    \ applying a clustering ﬁlter to Figure 3a. It shows\ntwo management zones based\
    \ on vine vigor (high-medium) for the grower to make decisions, together\nwith\
    \ water status maps, about fertilization and diﬀerential harvesting.\nAgronomy\

    3.3.1. Maps Containing Relevant Field Features\nDisplaying data in a coherent\
    \ format is key for ﬁnal users to understand what is happening in the\nﬁeld. The\
    \ most common way to display agricultural data has been in the format of maps,\
    \ as mapping is\nuseful to deﬁne spatial trends and homogeneous zones. However,\
    \ displaying agronomical information\nin beautiful maps should not be the goal\
    \ of map generation. Maps need to be useful for making decisions,\nthey need to\
    \ be a help to answer a question, providing an interpretation of spatial information\
    \ [39].\nThe goal of building maps is obtaining a few management zones with the\
    \ parameters of interest so that a\ntreatment can be eﬃciently applied. To get\
    \ plausible management zones, kriging is one of the most used\ninterpolation techniques\
    \ to delimit areas of manageable sizes [43]. Taking into account the considerable\n\
    amount of data that Smart Farming generates, there are many software applications\
    \ to cope with\ninterpolation, in general, or kriging in particular [66]. Also,\
    \ when building a map, a coordinate system\nneeds to be supplied along with the\
    \ map. One ideal alternative for agricultural maps is brought by\nthe Local Tangent\
    \ Plane (LTP) coordinate system, which features Euclidean geometry, allows user-set\n\
    origins, and employs the intuitive coordinate frame east-north. Regarding the\
    \ coding and display of\ndata in the maps, grids allow the systematic quantization\
    \ of the LTP coordinate system to manage crop\nproduction information more eﬃciently,\
    \ facilitating the exchange of information among successive\nseasons and the comparison\
    \ of multiple parameters on the same ﬁeld [67]. A practical example of\ngrid-based\
    \ maps using LTP coordinates is shown in Figure 3.\nTaking into account the key\
    \ role of positioning systems, a map-based approach is the method\nin which a\
    \ Global Positioning System (GPS)—or any other Global Navigation Satellite System\n\
    (GNSS)—receiver and a data logger (e.g., an onboard computer) are used to record\
    \ the position of a\nparticular measurement (georeferenced data), so several maps\
    \ can be generated and processed along\nwith other layers of spatially variable\
    \ information [68]. In general, GNSS receivers are the universal\nposition devices\
    \ used to build maps; however, in some cases, for example in greenhouses or dense\n\
    ﬁelds of tall trees, GNSS is not the best option to use due to the diﬃculty of\
    \ getting signals with reliable\naccuracy; so, in some cases, alternative solutions\
    \ such as machine vision must be implemented [69].\n3.3.2. Data Management Software\
    \ to Ease the Process of Decision Making\nA popular way to manage ﬁeld data displayed\
    \ on maps and culminate with a practical solution\nis through the use of Geographic\
    \ Information Systems (GIS). This set of computer-based tools (or\ndata platforms)\
    \ allows to store, analyze, manipulate and map any type of georeferenced information.\n\
    A speciﬁc GIS system called the Field-level geographic Information System (FIS)\
    \ was developed\nfor Precision Agriculture applications [70], but it was set for\
    \ old computer operative systems\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 207\n10 of 21\nsuch as Windows\
    \ 3.1×, 95, 98, or NT [71]. The updated version of FIS is the farm management\n\
    information system (FMIS), which according to Burlacu et al. [72] is a management\
    \ information system\ndesigned to assist farmers with various tasks, ranging from\
    \ operational planning, implementation and\ndocumentation to the assessment of\
    \ performed ﬁeld work. The purpose of FMIS is to reduce production\ncosts, comply\
    \ with agricultural standards, and maintain high product quality and safety, guiding\n\
    growers to make the best decisions possible [95]. Farm management software solutions\
    \ support the\nautomation of data acquisition and processing, monitoring, planning,\
    \ decision making, documenting,\nand managing the farm operations [64], and include\
    \ basic functions for record keeping like crop\nproduction rates (harvests and\
    \ yields), proﬁts and losses, farm tasks scheduling, weather prediction,\nsoil\
    \ nutrients tracking, and ﬁeld mapping, up to more complex functionalities for\
    \ automating ﬁeld\nmanagement accounting for farms and agribusinesses (accounting,\
    \ inventory management, or labor\ncontracts). In many cases, growers do not need\
    \ to be ﬂuid on data management because the software can\nbuild maps or decision-making\
    \ models with basic information introduced by growers. Furthermore,\na critical\
    \ feature of these applications is that they even help in the early warning of\
    \ weather-related\nhazards that enables farmers, policy makers, and aid agencies\
    \ to mitigate their exposure to risk [83].\nHowever, it must be taken into consideration\
    \ that the eﬃciency of a recommendation for a particular\nagent will depend on\
    \ the factors included in the algorithms of the software (technical, economic,\n\
    safety-wise. . . ). In this sense, a DSSAT (Decision Support System for Agrotechnology\
    \ Transfer)\nprovides outputs with experimental data for evaluation of crop models,\
    \ allowing users to compare\nsimulated outcomes with observed results, which is\
    \ critical if real-world decisions or recommendations\nare based on modeled results\
    \ [84]. Table 2 gathers a representative set of commercially available FMIS\n\
    programs speciﬁcally conﬁgured to deal with the usual data generated in the farm.\
    \ It includes the\nname of each application program, the company commercializing\
    \ it with its headquarters location,\nand the main features of the program. The\
    \ table is focused on programs managing crop data as the\nprimary tool, and its\
    \ purpose is not the compilation of all available FMIS software, which would\n\
    be futile given the rate new applications are constantly released, but bringing\
    \ a proof of the global\neﬀort realized in the last decade to deploy Smart Farming\
    \ in actual farms, accelerating the move\nfrom academics to agribusiness. The\
    \ examples show that some smartphone and tablet applications\nalready include\
    \ complex features so that growers can insert data directly in the ﬁeld; other\
    \ companies,\non the contrary, prefer having a basic application for mobile devices\
    \ to increase complexity in the\ncloud-based desktop version. In the majority\
    \ of cases, it is not necessary to have wireless connection\nwhile the grower\
    \ is entering data in the ﬁeld, because as soon as the mobile device ﬁnds a wireless\n\
    connection to the internet, it synchronizes the data previously introduced by\
    \ the grower in the mobile\ndevice with the data safely stored in the cloud. Many\
    \ of the programs listed below oﬀer the option\nof upgrading the software depending\
    \ on speciﬁc grower needs, increasing the price accordingly.\nThe most advanced\
    \ tools include features for ﬁnancial and machinery management, help in the\n\
    decision-making process, release warnings, or even propose management advice.\
    \ In many cases, these\nsoftware applications are not only addressed to the grower\
    \ or producer, but also to other stakeholders in\nagriculture such as inputs suppliers,\
    \ service suppliers, and food distributors, which makes a diﬀerence\nfor Smart\
    \ Farming, where multiple agriculture agents are connected. Regarding exploitation\
    \ rights,\nvarious agricultural management systems have been patented, as the\
    \ software from The Climate Corp.\nto generate agriculture prescriptions [85],\
    \ which entered into partnership with AGCO Corporation in\n2017 [4]. Decisive\

    \ T: Technology); 2 PaaS: Platform as a service.\nThe use of commercial data management\
    \ systems, as the ones listed in Table 2, often implies\nthat producers need to\
    \ share their crop data with a software platform owned and run by private\ncompanies.\
    \ This fact creates some controversy regarding the ownership of the data. In the\
    \ Software\nServices Agreement (SSA), it is stated that the person or entity providing\
    \ the data to the farm\nmanagement software company shall own and retain all rights,\
    \ title and interest in and to their\ndata, so that the data belongs to the provider\
    \ [76]. However, when data are aggregated with other\ngrowers’ data, the combined\
    \ data typically become property of the software company [96]. The list of\napplications\
    \ included in Table 2 proves that there is a global interest in developing software\
    \ for farm\ndata management, and most of the features requested by end-users are\
    \ similar everywhere. This table\nalso gives an idea of the interest raised in\
    \ industry by software-based management systems. However,\nmany applications use\
    \ their own proprietary formats, which complicates the share of data among data\n\
    acquisition and processing systems. A standardization eﬀort is needed among software\
    \ developers\nand providers. The ADAPT toolkit of Table 2 [77] is an example of\
    \ how to face this challenge, as it\nprovides an open-source application that\
    \ eliminates a barrier to the broad use of Precision Agriculture\ndata by enabling\
    \ interoperability between diﬀerent hardware and software applications.\n3.4.\
    \ Stage IV: Decision-Making\nIn situations where many ﬁeld parameters need being\
    \ considered, people ﬁnd practical diﬃculties\nin managing complex information\
    \ to make eﬀective decisions. In such cases, artiﬁcial intelligence\n(AI) can\
    \ help with techniques like deep learning or neural networks, fuzzy logic, genetic\
    \ algorithms,\nor expert systems. AI, with its modelling and reasoning capabilities,\
    \ can play a key role in agriculture,\nhelping to make sense of all the data available.\
    \ Fuzzy logic, to name one example within AI, resembles\nhuman reasoning imitating\
    \ the way of making decisions that involve several possibilities instead of\n\
    ‘true’ or ‘false’ alternatives; this technique uses linguistic variables that\
    \ ﬁt well with the complexity\nof the challenges posed by the diversity of agricultural\
    \ decision making. According to Dengel [20],\nagriculture oﬀers a vast application\
    \ area for all kinds of AI core technologies as agents operating in\nuncontrolled\
    \ environments. Giusti and Marsili-Libellia [81] designed a fuzzy-based decision\
    \ support\nsystem (DSS) taking as input variables soil moisture and rain forecast\
    \ for kiwi, corn, and potato.\nSimilarly, the DSS developed by Navarro-Hellín\
    \ et al. [87] estimated weekly irrigation for citrus\norchards taking into account\
    \ climate and soil variables; in that work, real-time measurements from soil\n\
    Agronomy 2020, 10, 207\n14 of 21\nparameters in a closed-loop control scheme were\
    \ decisive to avoid the accumulative eﬀect due to errors\nin consecutive weekly\
    \ estimations, as the DSS was allowed to adapt to local perturbations. In the\n\
    same fashion, Lindsay Corporation (Omaha, Nebraska, USA) was awarded for its solution\
    \ FieldNET\nAdvisor™ [91] that provides irrigation management decisions for growers.\
    \ DSS may be more robust\nand reliable when diﬀerent variables are considered,\
    \ but some procedures remain controversial as\nobjectives can lead to diﬀerent\
    \ solutions at diﬀerent times based on the priority set by decision makers\nor\
    \ other people involved in the procedure [88].\nSrivastava and Singh [80] highlighted\
    \ the importance of incorporating the graphical part of GIS to\nDSS, which was\
    \ demonstrated for water management scenarios in India. The importance of using\n\
    GIS for agricultural DSS lies on using user-friendly graphical interfaces for\
    \ growers. The result of a\nquestionnaire distributed by VineScout project [36]\
    \ members to the attendees of a ﬁeld demonstration in\nPortugal (October 2019),\
    \ evidenced the high value given to graphical user interfaces (GUI). Considering\n\
    that the prototype is in research phase and not commercial yet, 84% of the attendees\
    \ concluded that\nthe robot GUI shown in Figure 4 was simple to understand and\
    \ easy to use (unpublished research).\nRupnik et al. [89] developed a cloud-based\
    \ system to allow growers upload their own data, utilize\nseveral data analysis\
    \ methods, and ﬁnally present their outputs as decisions to apply. This time,\
    \ their\nuse case focused on spray planning for ﬁghting against pests in vineyards\
    \ and orchards. Rose et al. [90]\nconducted a survey on DSS and arrived to the\
    \ conclusion that 15 factors were inﬂuential in convincing\nUK growers and advisers\
    \ to use DSS, including usability, cost-eﬀectiveness, performance, relevance to\n\
    user, and compatibility with compliance demands. In addition, they found that\
    \ 49% of UK farmers used\nsome kind of DSS, and the preferred ways of delivery\
    \ were software (28%), paper-based (22%) tools,\nand mobile apps (10%). These\
    \ results show that the use of software to manage decisions is growing,\nbut its\
    \ percentage is still low and comparable to those who preferred paper-based tools.\
    \ Choosing\nsoftware and mobile applications to make agricultural decisions may\
    \ be considered beneﬁcial because\ndigital tools increase management eﬃciency\
    \ when compared to paper-based tools; however, there is\nstill a long way to make\
    \ technology-based tools attractive enough—easy to understand, intuitive and\n\
    nice—for growers to adopt. On the producer side, it is important to have access\
    \ to proper training\nuntil these technologies can be comfortably managed.\nAgronomy\

    \ equipment that can receive orders from a computerized control unit. Variable\n\
    rate machines can execute a number of farming tasks driven by a smart system [60].\
    \ Variable rate\ntechnology (VRT) applied on site-speciﬁc crop management (SSCM)\
    \ has the potential to increase\nproﬁt and decrease environmental impact [61]\
    \ as only what is needed is actually applied. Colaço\nand Molin [92] conducted\
    \ a long-term study for six years with the goal of evaluating the eﬀects of\n\
    variable rate fertilization on fertilizer consumption, soil fertility, and yield\
    \ in citrus. The outcomes\nof comparing variable and uniform rates showed that\
    \ the former achieved higher yields while using\nless fertilizer: using nitrogen,\
    \ fruit yield (kg of oranges) respect to the amount of fertilizer resulted\nin\
    \ a 32% yield increase in ﬁeld 1, and 38% in ﬁeld 2. When using potassium, the\
    \ yield increase even\nreached 40% in ﬁeld 1. In the case of phosphorus, the growth\
    \ rate was approximately 20% for both\nﬁelds. A recent review led by Nawar et\
    \ al. [93] conﬁrmed that, when management zone delineation\ntechniques were used\
    \ for variable-rate nutrient application, farm eﬃciency increased in all cases\n\
    when compared to traditional uniform-rate applications, and environmental impacts\
    \ were reduced.\nMachinery manufacturers are leading the development of commercial\
    \ solutions implementing VRT.\nThomasson et al. [62] described commercial VRT\
    \ systems oﬀered by major agricultural machinery\nmanufacturers, like CLAAS, that\
    \ used the ISARIA crop sensor for the variable-rate application of\nnitrogen-based\
    \ fertilizer, or the CEBIS MOBILE ISOBUS, which, apart from having other Precision\n\
    Agriculture functions, it is a compatible terminal to integrate the ISARIA sensor.\
    \ Another promising\ntype of variable actuation is automatic diﬀerential harvesting\
    \ or variable rate harvesting (VRH),\nwhich attempts harvesting according to previously\
    \ deﬁned management zones. In specialty crops,\nSethuramasamyraja [40] worked\
    \ in diﬀerential harvesting for vineyards by using near-infrared sensors\nto determine\
    \ grape quality in the ﬁeld based on the anthocyanin content of berries. The three\
    \ steps for\nthis VRH system involved sensing the anthocyanin content of grapes,\
    \ using these data to produce\nquality map based on a threshold anthocyanin level,\
    \ and feeding the quality map to the harvester for its\ncommanding. CLAAS was\
    \ awarded for implementing VRH in combines and forage harvesters [91] by\nmerging\
    \ precision sensing technology with autonomous machine control. The goal was to\
    \ maximize\nproductivity and automatically optimize harvester performance, according\
    \ to the changing conditions\nof the soil, plants, grain, and humidity in the\
    \ harvested ﬁeld. A USDA statistical analysis conducted in\n2010 [3] showed that\
    \ variable rate technologies had positive, but small, rate adoptions of 1% due\
    \ to\ntheir diﬃculty of use. Apart from eﬃciency and utility, cost is also a critical\
    \ parameter to consider for\nthe adoption of this technology. In this sense, the\
    \ ubiquitous availability of low-cost electronics will\nfavor the introduction\
    \ of such digital applications. In fact, advances in autonomous driving technology\n\
    for cars, including object detection capabilities through multi-camera systems,\
    \ have already reduced\nthe cost of developing automated agricultural machines\
    \ [22].\n4. Discussion\nAfter the Industrial Revolution, mainly since the advent\
    \ of mechanization, and along the Green\nRevolution, humans and machines have\
    \ been eﬃciently collaborating for growing crops to feed people.\nHowever, to\
    \ face the population growth in the coming years, an extra eﬀort is needed to\
    \ succeed,\nnot only in feeding people by increasing productivity, but also in\
    \ doing it in the most eﬃcient and\nrespectful possible way, that is, producing\
    \ sustainably. To face this challenge, remarkable advances in\ntechnology have\
    \ been appearing over the last decades, in particular the access to reliable agricultural\n\
    data and advanced computer techniques to get the optimal meaning from them, eventually\
    \ obtaining\nmaximum beneﬁts while being respectful with the environment. This\
    \ new approach driven by digital\ntechnology implies that growers must act as\
    \ supervisors of their crops rather than laborers, in an attempt\nAgronomy 2020,\
    \ 10, 207\n16 of 21\nof avoiding repetitive, physically-demanding, and tedious\
    \ ﬁeld tasks. In this modern agronomical\nframework, DATA is the key, and the\
    \ information-based management cycle described above provides\nthe practical approach\
    \ that unites concept and tasks. The following points summarize some of the\n\
    speciﬁc ideas drawn from this study:\n•\nPrecision Agriculture, which consists\
    \ of applying what is needed when and where is needed,\nhas further improved the\
    \ eﬃciency of managing farms with the addition of data-based digital\nsystems\
    \ that increase the knowledge of producers about their ﬁelds; this is known as\
    \ Agriculture\n4.0 or Digital Farming. When these data-driven farms incorporate\
    \ robotics with AI algorithms to\ntheir systems, the overall concept is then referred\
    \ to as Agriculture 5.0. Some studies report that\nagricultural robots integrating\
    \ forms of AI can do certain tasks faster than humans [23]. Despite\nthere are\
    \ other studies that contradict this statement [63], robotics is a growing economy\
    \ and there\nexists a great potential for many applications within agriculture.\n\
    •\nA greater adoption of Digital Farming by professional growers is vital to not\
    \ only improving a\nfarm’s ﬁnancial performance, but also to meet the food needs\
    \ of an expanding population [6].\nSmall farms will steadily incorporate basic\
    \ technology whereas large ﬁelds will likely invest with\nsophisticated equipment,\
    \ but data-less intuition-driven management will no longer represent\nthe modus\
    \ operandi of professional farms in the future. This should be considered a source\
    \ of\nopportunities, especially for a new generation of young farmers used to\
    \ digital technology, who\nare the ones with the capacity to balance an aging\
    \ population in rural areas, mainly those in\nindustrialized countries.\n•\nAfter\
    \ the rapid growth of UAVs, a steady-state is being reached, mostly induced by\
    \ the fact that\ndata analysis and ground-truth validation has resulted far more\
    \ complex and delicate than image\nacquisition and platform handling. This has\
    \ promoted the expansion of proximal sensing and the\nexploration of combining\
    \ both data sources—aerial and terrestrial—for a better understanding of\nthe\
    \ physiology of plants and trees.\n•\nMaps, as the most common way to represent\
    \ agricultural data, would need to be standardized.\nIntensely-interpolated colored\
    \ maps are output by GIS, FMIS, and other software applications,\nbut at the time\
    \ of comparing data with the precision enough to grant statistical signiﬁcance,\
    \ it often\nbecomes an impossible mission without standardization. Figure 3, for\
    \ example, uses the ﬂat\nrepresentation provided by the local tangent plane (LTP)\
    \ and formatted in a regular grid. Other\nprograms use UTM projections, and there\
    \ are even images only given in geodetic coordinates.\nAt the need of overlapping\
    \ maps, it takes a big eﬀort to make all data compatible. Not only the\nway coordinates\
    \ are represented needs a standard, but also the units, intervals, and even colors\
    \ in\nwhich parameters are displayed. The combination of aerial and ground data,\
    \ for instance, will\ngreatly beneﬁt from such standardization in the way data\
    \ is visually displayed for the average\ngrower to understand.\n•\nTable 2 provides\
    \ a representative compilation of software applications for farm management.\n\
    The list is not exhaustive, and yet includes companies from four continents and\
    \ 14 countries,\nwhich provides evidence of the fact that agricultural digitalization\
    \ is in fact a global move.\n•\nRegarding variable rate applications, adoption\
    \ rates need to augment, and to do so, farmers must\nﬁnd by themselves the value\
    \ in this technology for their crops. Only after maintaining accurate\nspatial\
    \ records and analyzing ﬁeld data can eﬀective variable rate prescriptions be\
    \ created [39] to\naddress particular tasks.\n5. Conclusions\nThis analysis conﬁrms\
    \ that consistent knowledge about farms leads to optimal decisions.\nAgricultural\
    \ management systems can handle farm data in such a way that results are orchestrated\n\
    to address customized solutions for each farm. This aid for farmers in the form\
    \ of digital solutions\ncombines forces with robotics and artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ to launch the imminent idea of Agriculture\nAgronomy 2020, 10, 207\n17 of 21\n\
    5.0. After thirty years of great expectations—and disappointments—by the application\
    \ of robotics to\nagriculture, the timing seems right for the ﬁrst time. However,\
    \ in order to take the most advantages\nfrom Agriculture 5.0, deep training needs\
    \ to be delivered to users, ideally young farmers eager to\nlearn and apply modern\
    \ technologies to agriculture and granting a generational renewal still to come.\n\
    It seems to be the right time to move forward towards a modern and sustainable\
    \ agriculture that\nis capable of showing the full power of data-driven management\
    \ to face the challenges posed to\nfood production in the 21st Century. The evolution\
    \ to Agriculture 5.0 is in the agenda of most major\nfarm equipment makers for\
    \ the next decade, and therefore oﬀ-road equipment manufacturers will\nplay a\
    \ key role in this move if agricultural robots are considered as the next—smarter—generation\
    \ of\nfarm machines.\nAuthor Contributions: V.S.-R. and F.R.-M. contributed to\

    & Engineering Chemistry Research Abstract In agriculture irrigation management,
    irrigation scheduling is typically performed in an open-loop fashion and is done
    only once at the beginning of a growing season. In this work, we study whether
    closed-loop scheduling with closed-loop control can lead to improved performance
    in terms of crop yield and water conservation in agriculture irrigation. The interaction
    between soil, water, crop (maize in this work), and atmosphere is described by
    an agro-hydrological model, which is a partial differential equation. In the proposed
    scheduling and control scheme, both the scheduler and the controller are designed
    using model predictive control (MPC). The scheduler uses a long horizon (with
    a sampling period of 1 day) that covers the entire crop growth season, and the
    horizon shrinks as time moves. The primary objective of the scheduler is to maximize
    the crop yield. The controller uses a much shorter prediction horizon and a much
    finer sampling period. The primary objective of the controller is to track the
    soil moisture reference calculated by the scheduler. To alleviate the computational
    complexity of the scheduler and the controller, a linear parameter varying (LPV)
    model is identified for the scheduler and controller, respectively. The performance
    of the closed-loop scheduling scheme is evaluated against the traditional open-loop
    scheduling scheme under different scenarios. This publication is licensed under

    ISSUE This article is part of the Sirish Shah Festschrift special issue. 1. Introduction
    ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To Water scarcity is an increasingly pressing issue globally.
    It is critical to increase the efficiency of water usage especially in agriculture
    since it consumes the largest portion of fresh water (70% approximately). (1,2)
    Traditionally, agriculture irrigation decisions are primarily made in open-loop
    on the basis of empirical or heuristic knowledge, and no real-time feedback information
    (e.g., soil moisture) from the field is used. These open-loop irrigation methods
    are not precise and typically lead to significant over irrigation. In the past
    decade, there has been an increasing interest in lower-level closed-loop agriculture
    irrigation for precision irrigation. Different control algorithms based on real-time
    field feedback like soil moisture measurement have been reported in the literature.
    For example, Goodchild et al. proposed a modified proportional-integral-derivative
    (PID) control to improve the irrigation precision. (3) Kim et al. developed a
    closed-loop irrigation control system for a self-propelled lateral-move sprinkler
    irrigation system. (4) Model predictive control (MPC) has also been investigated
    in the optimal control of agriculture irrigation. Park et al. used MPC to maintain
    the field at desired soil moisture and salt levels. (5) McCarthy et al. used crop
    production models in MPC to optimize irrigation time and amount. (6) Delgoda et
    al. implemented MPC to minimize root zone soil moisture deficit and irrigation
    amount with a limit on water supply. (7) Recently, Mao et al. developed a zone
    MPC algorithm to maintain soil moisture within a target zone instead of a set-point.
    This approach was shown to lead to further water conservation. (8) The above-mentioned
    irrigation control studies all focus on short time (hourly or daily) irrigation
    management. A typical objective of these studies is to maintain the soil moisture
    or root zone soil moisture deficit at a predetermined set-point or zone. Irrigation
    scheduling is another important subject in agriculture irrigation management,
    which considers water management over a much longer time period (e.g., the entire
    growing season of a crop). In general, a water balance accounting for plant water
    consumption, evaporation and drainage loss, historical weather data, and available
    soil moisture is used in irrigation scheduling. (9−11) Different objectives were
    considered in irrigation scheduling including, for example, profit maximization,
    (12) crop yield maximization, (13) and irrigation uniformity optimization. (14)
    One common feature of the above scheduling studies is that the scheduling optimization
    problem is only solved once at the beginning of the crop growing season, and the
    solution is used for the entire season. In this work, we introduce feedback into
    irrigation scheduling and integrate it with irrigation control to form a hierarchical
    closed-loop scheduling and control scheme. It is well recognized in chemical process
    industries that the closed-loop scheduling and control can bring improved economic
    performance. (15−19) The primary objective of this work is to study the closed-loop
    scheduling and control in agriculture irrigation management and investigate whether
    closed-loop scheduling brings any benefits to irrigation management. In the proposed
    closed-loop scheduling and control scheme, a scheduler operates in the top layer
    with the objective to maximize the crop yield. The scheduler calculates the target
    soil moisture value and passes it to a lower layer irrigation controller. The
    lower layer controller’s primary objective is to follow the target soil moisture.
    Both the scheduler and the controller are designed in the framework of MPC. The
    scheduler uses a prediction horizon that covers the entire growing season of the
    crop (maize in this work). The scheduler is re-evaluated every week on the basis
    of updated weather forecast and soil moisture measurement from the field with
    a shrinking horizon. The controller uses a prediction horizon of 1 week and calculates
    irrigation commands to follow the target soil moisture determined by the scheduler.
    The soil water dynamics of the field are described by an agro-hydrological model
    that consists of a partial differential equation. To alleviate the computational
    complexity of the scheduler and the controller, a linear parameter varying (LPV)
    model is identified for the scheduler and the controller, respectively, based
    on input and output data from the agro-hydrological model. The main contributions
    of this work include: A method to identify an LPV model for the scheduler to describe
    the interaction between soil water and the crop over the entire growing season
    that contains different growing stages. The LPV model is computationally efficient
    for online optimization. A detailed closed-loop scheduler and controller design
    to maximize crop yield and water conservation. Extensive simulations that investigate
    the performance of the closed-loop scheduler with respect to the traditional open-loop
    scheduling. 2. System Description ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To The system considered
    consists of the soil−water–atmosphere–crop environment. The interaction between
    the soil, the water, the atmosphere, and the crop is described by an agro-hydrological
    model. The yield of the crop is characterized using the ratio of the actual evapo-transpiration
    to the potential evapo-transpiration. The crop considered is maize. A schematic
    of the considered system is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1 Figure 1. System considered
    consists of the soil−water–atmosphere–crop environment over the entire growing
    season of the crop maize. 2.1. Agro-hydrological Model We consider an agro-hydrological
    system that characterizes the interaction between the soil, the water, the atmosphere,
    and the crop. The system is modeled by a set of empirical and physical relations.
    The dynamics of the water flow inside soil is described using the Richards equation:
    (20) (1) where θ is the soil moisture content (cm/cm), K is the hydraulic conductivity
    (cm/h), z is the vertical distance inside soil matrix (cm) taken positive upward,
    S includes the source and sink terms (h–1), such as soil water extraction rate
    by plant roots, and h is the matric potential (cm) also known as soil suction.
    The hydraulic conductivity K can be expressed in terms of soil moisture content
    as follows: (21) (2) where Ksat is saturated hydraulic conductivity, λ = 0.5 is
    the shape parameter, (22) and Se is the relative saturation given by (3) where
    θres is the residual moisture content (cm/cm), θsat is the saturated moisture
    content (cm/cm). The relation between soil moisture content θ and matric potential
    h is described by the Van Genuchten model: (23) (4) where η and m are empirical
    shape factors, and αv is the inverse of air entry suction (cm–1). In general,
    m is considered as a dependent variable of η such as . Thus, the Richards equation
    can be described as follows: (5) where C is the hydraulic capacity, which accounts
    for the change of soil moisture due to the change of soil matric potential; that
    is, C = dθ/dh. In the Richards equation, eq 5, S(h) represents the soil water
    extraction rate by the crop roots, which accounts for the transpiration rate T.
    The top water flux qtop at the soil-atmosphere interface is considered in the
    top boundary calculation of the Richards equation. The top water flux qtop can
    be expressed as follows: (6) where qtop is the top flux, I is the irrigation rate,
    P is the precipitation rate, and E denotes evaporation. The transpiration T and
    evaporation E are calculated following the method in SWAP model. (24) The top
    boundary of this agro-hydrological system is time varying depending on the surface
    soil moisture condition, and may switch between the flux and the pressure head
    boundary conditions. Both of these boundary conditions are determined using the
    qtop value as described in the work of Van Dam and Feddes. (25) In this study
    the bottom boundary condition is taken as free drainage. Following the method
    used in the work of Van Dam et al. (24) and Nahar et al., (26)eq 5 can be discretized
    using the implicit finite difference method with explicit linearization of the
    hydraulic conductivity K(h). Let us consider that the spatial domain is discretized
    into ND compartments with the top one as compartment 1 and the bottom one as compartment
    ND. After discretization, at compartment i (i = 2, ..., ND – 1), the water content
    dynamics are described as follows: (7) where hi is the matric potential of the
    i-th compartment, n denotes the discretized time with a sampling period of a hour,
    , , , , ui(k) = Si(k)Δzi, and Δzi denotes the thickness of compartment i. In eq
    7, Ki+1/2 denotes the average hydraulic conductivity between compartment i and
    i + 1. The boundary conditions of the system define i = 1 and i = ND. Defining
    h = [h1h2 ... hND]T, combining the equations for the ND compartments together,
    and splitting the inputs to the system into manipulated inputs and uncontrolled
    inputs, the overall dynamics can be written in the following compact form: (8)
    where u is the manipulated input (irrigation) and w denotes disturbances and uncontrolled
    inputs such as rain and weather conditions. Note that h is a column vector whose
    size depends on the number of discretization points ND in the spatial domain.
    On the basis of eq 4, the soil moisture is a function of the matric potential
    h. For the soil moisture at each compartment i, we can use eq 4 to find the corresponding
    matric potential hi. For brevity, we write these equations in the following compact
    form: (9) where the function g represents the relation between θ and h as expressed
    in eq 4. Note that when i = 1, it indicates the top surface. Eqs 8 and 9 define
    the system equations for the dynamics of water flow inside soil. For more details
    of the derivation of eqs 8 and 9, the reader may refer to Nahar et al. (26) 2.2.
    Crop Yield Model The crop yield is modeled as a function of the potential evapo-transpiration
    and the actual evapo-transpiration as follows: (12) (10) where Ya is the actual
    yield, Yp is the potential maximum yield, ETa is the actual evapo-transpiration
    and ETp is the potential evapo-transpiration, and is the crop sensitivity factor
    (also known as yield response factor) for the growing period at time k. Crop sensitivity
    factor is a measure used to indicate the impact of water stress (at different
    growing stages) on the overall yield of the crop. When the actual yield is equal
    to the potential yield, eq 10 takes its minimum value zero. In eq 10, represents
    the yield reduction or the yield deficiency and represents the relative reduction
    in evapo-transpiration or ET deficiency. The potential and the actual evapo-transpiration
    values of a crop are defined as follows: (27) (11) (12) where is an empirical
    crop factor that describes the relation of ETp to the potential evapo-transpiration
    of the reference crop (grass) ET0, and is the water stress factor, which is a
    function of the soil moisture and relates ETa to ETp. In eq 11, the reference
    evapo-transpiration ET0 is calculated using Penman–Montieth equation based on
    hourly weather data. (27) In eq 12, the water stress factor is modeled following
    the method in Feddes’s work (28) and will be made clear in Section 3.3.1. It is
    noted that eq 12 holds when other factors such as nutrient deficiency or diseases
    are not present. Combining eqs 10 and 12, the following relation can be obtained
    to describe the relation between the crop yield and soil moisture: (13) In this
    work, following the work of Van Dam et al., (24) a simple maize model is used
    to calculate the evapo-transpiration amounts at different growing stages. Note
    that the crop water requirement increases as the crop grows. This implies that
    more water is required to keep the soil moisture at the same level as crop grows.
    3. Problem Formulation and Proposed Design ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To 3.1. Closed-Loop
    Scheduling and Control Problem Formulation In this section, we describe the proposed
    closed-loop scheduling and control framework for precision irrigation. The scheduler
    and the controller form a hierarchical decision making system. In this work, both
    the scheduler and the controller will be designed in the framework of MPC. The
    primary objective of the scheduler is to maximize the crop yield at the end of
    the entire growing season. It considers a much longer horizon that covers the
    entire growing season and uses historical weather data, available weekly weather
    forecast, and soil moisture measurement from the field to calculate the soil moisture
    reference trajectories for the lower layer controller. The primary objective of
    the controller is to track the soil moisture reference calculated by the scheduler.
    It uses a fixed prediction horizon of a week and takes into account the soil moisture
    measurement and daily weather forecast in its irrigation command calculation.
    A schematic of the closed-loop scheduling and control framework is shown in Figure
    2. Figure 2 Figure 2. Structure of the closed-loop scheduling and control system.
    Left: Process block diagram; Right: The design of prediction horizon. 3.2. Scheduling
    and Control Model Identification The direct use of the agro-hydrological model,
    eqs 8 and 9, in the scheduler and the controller is computationally challenging
    due to the stiffness of the nonlinear system when the soil moisture is low, the
    high dimensions of the discretized system, and the large horizon covered by the
    scheduler. In order to overcome the computational challenge and to capture the
    dynamics between the input and the output of the agro-hydrological system, we
    propose to identify an LPV model for the scheduler and the controller, respectively.
    The two LPV models can be identified based on the simulated input–output data
    from the agro-hydrological model. LPV models have been widely used to describe
    nonlinear processes due to its simple structure and its ability to approximate
    complex nonlinear systems. (29−32) 3.2.1. Scheduling Model The output of the scheduling
    model is the average root zone soil moisture content described as follows: (14)
    where θs is the average root zone soil moisture, θi is determined by eq 9, and
    Nr < ND is the deepest node that contains the crop roots. Note that Nr changes
    over time as the length of roots grows. The LPV model consists of a set of linear
    models that are connected with varying parameters which are functions of scheduling
    variables. (33) The scheduling variables are the ones that can be used to reflect
    the nonlinearity of the dynamics of the system. For the scheduling model, two
    scheduling variables are used. They are the soil moisture s1 (s1 = θ) and the
    root depth s2. The sampling period used in the scheduling model is 1 day. For
    each scheduling variable, a few working points need to be determined and around
    those working points, linear models are identified. Let us assume that we have
    H working points for s1 and G working points for s2. These working points define
    a mesh with HG nodes. For each of these nodes, a linear model should be identified.
    Let us also use (i, j) (i = 1, 2, ..., H, j = 1, 2, ..., G) to denote the node
    defined by the i-th s1 working point and the j-th s2 working point. For each node
    (i, j), a linear model of the following form is identified: (15) where m denotes
    the discrete time with a sampling period of a day, xi,j is the output of the linear
    model for (i, j), api,j (p = 1, 2, ..., na), bqi,j (q = 1, 2, ..., nb), and di,j
    are model parameters, u is the manipulated input. The model orders na and nb are
    determined prior to the identification process. This model can also be expressed
    as follows: (16) where φi,j(m) = [−xi,j(m – 1), ..., −xi,j(m – na), u(m – 1), ...,
    u(m – nb), 1]T, and βi,j = [a1i,j, ..., anai,j, b1i,j, ..., bnbi,j, di,j]T. With
    respect to s1 (soil moisture), the linear models are combined together using Gaussian
    weighting functions as follows: (17) where y∗j is an intermediate variable, and
    the weighting function αi is given by (18) where with s1,i the soil moisture value
    of the i-th prespecified s1 working point, σi1 and σi2 being two parameters that
    need to be identified, which is related to the validity width of the linear model.
    (8) With respect to s2 (root length), the outputs obtained from eq 17 are further
    linearly interpolated to get the final output of the LPV model: (19) given that
    the root length at time m lies between s2,j and s2,j+1 (i.e., s2,j ≤ s2(m) ≤ s2,j+1).
    Note that the length of the roots grows according to the time after seeding and
    is considered as a function of time in this work. In eq 19, y is the average water
    content within the root zone given by the LPV model. Eq 19 is the model that will
    be used in the scheduler and may be written equivalently in the following state-space
    form: (20) (21) where A, B are composed of elements in βi,j (i = 1, 2, ..., H,
    j = 1, 2, ..., G), C depends on the two scheduling variables, d is composed of
    di,j, and us is composed of the current and previous daily irrigation amounts.
    The detailed identification of the above LPV model will be discussed in Section
    4. 3.2.2. Control Model Since the controller uses a relatively much smaller prediction
    horizon (a week), we consider an LPV model with only the soil moisture (s1) as
    the scheduling variable. In this model, we consider the root length of the crop
    is constant within each control prediction horizon. The output of the control
    model is also the average soil water content within the root zone as defined in
    eq 14. The sampling period of the LPV model for control purposes is also a day.
    The LPV takes the following form: (22a) (22b) where x̃i is the output of a submodel
    and ỹ is the final output of the LPV model, api (p = 1, 2, ..., na), bqi (q =
    1, 2, ..., nb), and di are model parameters, αi is a weighting factor determined
    following eq 18. At different crop growing stages, the above control model should
    be reidentified to account for the growth of the crop. The above model can also
    be written equivalently in the following state-space form: (23) (24) where Ã,
    B̃ are composed of api and bqi (i = 1, 2, ..., H), C̃ depends on the scheduling
    variable, d̃ is composed of di, and uc is composed of the current and previous
    daily irrigation amounts. The details will be discussed also in Section 4. 3.3.
    Design of Scheduler and Controller 3.3.1. Design of the Scheduler As explained
    earlier, the main objective of the scheduler is to minimize the crop yield deficiency
    while reducing the irrigation water usage. From eq 13, it can be seen that crop
    yield relates to the water stress factor . The stress factor characterizes the
    suppression of root water update due to either drought or insufficient aeration.
    Figure 3 shows a typical relation of and soil moisture. (28) When the soil moisture
    θ is between θL (limiting point) and θa (anaerobic point), there is no water stress
    (). When the soil moisture θ is below θL but larger than θw (wilting point), water
    stress takes place due to drought. When the soil moisture θ is above θa but less
    than θu, there is crop water stress due to insufficient aeration; when θ is above
    θu, crop transpiration stops. For all other soil moisture region, root water extraction
    is completely suppressed. Therefore, it is also important to ensure that the soil
    moisture is always between θw and θu. Specifically, the value of the water stress
    factor is determined as follows: (28) (25) Figure 3 Figure 3. Relation of soil
    moisture content and water stress factor. (28) The scheduler optimization problem
    is evaluated every week. It uses a prediction horizon from the current week to
    the end of the growing season T. Within each week, the irrigation is considered
    to be constant. For week k, the optimization problem is shown below: (26a) (26b)
    (26c) (26d) (26e) (26f) (26g) (26h) In the optimization problem (eq 26), eq 26a
    defines the cost function to be minimized. In eq 26a, the first term indicates
    the crop yield deficiency at the end of the growing season, the second term measures
    the irrigation amount in the remaining growing season, the last summation term
    includes two slack variables that are used to handle constraints on the soil moisture
    in eq 26g, and Qs1, Qs2, Qs3 are positive weighting factors. Eq 26b is the model
    used to calculate the crop yield deficiency. Note that in eq 26b the first part
    on the right-hand side is calculated on the basis of actual soil water content
    measurements, and the second part is calculated on the basis of soil water content
    predicted in the scheduler. Eqs 26c and 26d are the LPV model for scheduling evaluated
    for a week with constant input. Note that the sampling period of the model identified
    in the previous subsection is a day. The scheduler optimization problem, however,
    evaluates once every week. Within a week, the input is held constant. Eq 26c reflects
    this type of consideration. Eq 26e defines the initial condition of the scheduling
    optimization problem, and x̅(k) denotes the current state measurement. Note that
    we assume that the state is measured. Eq 26f requires that all the irrigation
    should be non-negative and is less than the maximum allowed limit umax. Eq 26g
    imposes the constraint such that θw < y < θu as soft constraints through the introduction
    of two slack variables ε1 and ε2. Eq 26h implies that the two slack variables
    are non-negative. The weighting factors Qs3 and Qs4 should be tuned to be relatively
    higher to avoid constraint violation. The solution to the above scheduling optimization
    problem is a sequence of optimal irrigation amount from week k to T. Let us denote
    the optimal weekly irrigation as u*(l|k), l = k, ..., T – 1. Let us also denote
    the corresponding weekly optimal soil moisture as y*(l|k), l = k, ..., T – 1.
    The first two values of the optimal irrigation values u*(k|k), u*(k + 1|k), and
    the corresponding soil moisture values y*(k|k), y*(k + 1|k) are sent to the controller
    as references. At the next week, the scheduling optimization problem is re-evaluated
    with new soil moisture measurement. 3.3.2. Design of the Controller In the controller
    design, the control LPV model is first augmented with an output disturbance to
    account for model-plant mismatch. Then, an observer is designed to estimate the
    model-plant mismatch. The augmented model is as follows: (27) (28) (29) On the
    basis of the above augmented model, the following observer is designed to estimate
    the output disturbance: (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) where x̂, p̂, ŷ, and y̅ denote
    the estimated state, estimated disturbance, estimated output, and output measurement,
    respectively. The observer gains Lx and Lp are determined as discussed in Mao
    et al. (8) The primary objective of the controller is to track the soil moisture
    and total irrigation water consumption references calculated by the scheduler.
    The controller is also designed in the framework of MPC. The controller is evaluated
    every day with updated soil moisture measurements. The controller uses a fixed
    prediction horizon of a week (i.e., 7). At day m, the controller is formulated
    as follows: (35a) (35b) (35c) (35d) (35e) (35f) (35g) (35h) In the optimization
    problem (eq 35), eq 35a defines the cost function to be minimized. In eq 35a,
    y* and u* denote the references from the scheduler. The first term requires that
    the predicted average soil moisture content within the root zone should be close
    to the reference from the scheduler, the second term requires that the total water
    consumption over a week is close to the predicted consumption of the scheduler,
    and the last terms contain two slack variables. In eq 35a, Qc, Qc1, Qc2, and R
    are positive weighting factors. Eq 35b is the LPV model for control. Eq 35c implies
    that a constant output disturbance is considered in the optimization of the controller
    and the disturbance value is given by the observer as specified in eq 35e. This
    constant output disturbance is added to the output equation as specified in eq
    35d. Eq 35e defines the initial condition of the control optimization problem,
    and x̂ is from the observer. Eq 35f requires that all the irrigation should be
    non-negative and is smaller than or equal to one-seventh of the weekly upper limit.
    Eq 35g imposes the constraint such that θw < ỹ < θu as soft constraints. Eq 35h
    implies that the two slack variables are non-negative. The solution to the optimization
    problem (eq 35) is a sequence of optimal irrigation amount for time l = m, ...,
    m + 6 denoted by u*(l|m), l = m, ..., m + 6. At time m, only the first element
    from the optimal daily irrigation input is applied to the field. The rest are
    discarded. At the next day m + 1, the optimization problem is solved again 4.
    Results and Discussion ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To 4.1. LPV Model Identification and
    Validation In the identification of the scheduling LPV model, three working points
    are considered for each of the two scheduling variables (H = 3, G = 3). In the
    input-output data generation, the three s2 working points are s2 = [s2,1, s2,2,
    s2,3]T = [10.3571, 55.3571, 99.881]T cm. These working points are picked according
    to the root length of maize at different growing stages (see Figure 4). Specifically,
    the first working point of s2 corresponds to the root length about 10 days after
    seeding and is picked to represent the baby plant. The second working point is
    the mean value of the root length of the rapid growing stage and the last working
    point is the root length at the fully matured stage. For each working point of
    s2, three different s1 working points are considered. For s2,1, the three s1 working
    points are s1{1} = [s1,1{1}, s1,2{1}, s1,3{1}]T = [0.0755, 0.0936, 0.1792]T. For
    s2,2, the three s1 working points are s1{2} = [s1,1{2}, s1,2{2}, s1,3{2}]T = [0.0789,
    0.1211, 0.1988]T. For s2,3, the three s1 working points are s1{3} = [s1,1{3},
    s1,2{3}, s1,3{3}]T = [0.0835, 0.1176, 0.1564]T. For each s2 working point, the
    three s1 working points are determined according to three (small, medium, large)
    steady-state irrigation amounts, which are picked based on extensive simulations
    and trail-and-error. In determining these irrigation amounts, one consideration
    is the possible soil moisture range of the system (about 0.05–0.35), and another
    consideration is the nonlinearity feature of the agro-hydrological system. The
    orders of the local models na and nb are both picked to be one based on the results
    of Mao et al. (8) Figure 4 Figure 4. Root length of maize according to time after
    seeding. The input and output data for the LPV identification generated from the
    agro-hydrological model is shown in Figure 5. In generating the data, the daily
    weather condition is kept constant with no rain. Binary input signals are used
    around the working points. During the transition from one working point to another
    of s1 (soil moisture), constant inputs are used. In the top plot of Figure 5,
    CS1, CS2, CS3 correspond to the three working points of s2 (root depth). During
    these regions, binary inputs are used. Region CV1 and CV2 correspond to transition
    periods from s2,1 to s2,2 and from s2,2 to s2,3. In these two regions, constant
    inputs are used to show the effect of crop root zone on soil moisture. As crop
    root length increases (from CS1 to CS3), more irrigation is required to maintain
    the soil moisture as shown in the top plot of Figure 5. Following the approach
    in Mao et al., (8) the parameters of the LPV model are identified and shown in
    Table 1. The bottom plot of Figure 5 shows the predicted trajectory and the actual
    trajectory generated by the agro-hydrological model. The LPV model overall has
    a good fit over the entire period with the percentage difference between the predicted
    value of the LPV model and the actual value of the agro-hydrological model about
    5% or less except in the region CV1, which corresponds to the rapid growing stage
    (whose percentage difference is about 18%). To further validate the developed
    LPV model over the crop growing season, an open-loop simulation of the agro-hydrological
    model is performed. Fixed weather condition is considered with no rain, and an
    input irrigation of 2.5 cm/day is considered. The result is shown in Figure 6.
    The overall percentage difference between the predicted value given by the LPV
    model and the value generated by the agro-hydrological model is about 27% with
    most of it contributed from the period between day 23 and day 45 which corresponds
    to the rapid growing stage. In the rest of the period, the percentage difference
    is around 15%. Given the complexity of the agro-hydrological system and the use
    of feedback, the mismatch between the LPV model and the agro-hydrological model
    is considered to be acceptable. Note that the performance of the LPV model may
    be improved by including more working points. Figure 5 Figure 5. Input–output

    6. Validation of the scheduling LPV model. In the controller, the three local
    linear models of each root length working point are weighted using the corresponding
    Gaussian weights in Table 1 and then are used in the controller design. For example,
    in CS1 and up to the middle of CV1, the local models of root length working point
    1 are weighted and used in the MPC controller. The switching between root length
    working points is based on the root length. 4.2. Scheduling and Control Simulation
    Results The proposed closed-loop scheduling and control is applied to the agro-hydrological
    system under different scenarios. The proposed closed-loop scheduling approach
    is compared with an open-loop scheduling scheme in which the scheduling optimization
    is only solved once at the beginning and applied throughout the growing season.
    In the open-loop scheduling scheme, the same closed-loop controller is used. The
    crop growing season is considered to be 23 weeks from seeding. The values of the
    crop sensitivity factor at different crop growth stages (from 0 to 2 with 0 indicating
    initial seeding stage and 2 implying mature stage) for maize are shown in Table
    2. (34) The weekly irrigation upper limit is umax = 70 cm/week, which implies
    that the daily irrigation limit is 10 cm. Table 2. Values of Crop Sensitivity

    Weather In the first scenario, we consider that the amount of rain in the current
    crop season is similar to that of the historical weather data. In this scenario,
    we consider that the actual total rain in the crop growing season is 164.05 cm
    but the historical weather data suggests the total rain over the season to be
    154.50 cm. In the closed-loop scheduling, the scheduler is updated at the end
    of each week with an update weather forecast for the next 2 weeks and the current
    soil moisture measurement. While in the open-loop scheduling, only the historical
    weather data is used at the beginning of the season. As for the controller, in
    both schemes, the field soil moisture is updated every day with field measurements
    and the weather data is also updated for the next 7 days. Uncertainties are considered
    in weather forecast. First, we consider a water conservation case. That is, in
    the scheduler design, more emphasis is put on water conservation. In this case,
    the weighting factors are chosen as Qs1 = 10002, Qs2 = 100, Qs3 = 109, and Qs4
    = 1. The value of Qs3 is chosen very high to ensure that the constraint on the
    lower soil moisture limit is not violated. The weight on the upper soil moisture
    limit is relatively low since it is less important and can be controlled to some
    extent by the irrigation amount. Compared with the next case to be studied, Qs2
    = 100 puts more weighting on water consumption. The values for θu and θw are taken
    as 0.41 cm/cm and 0.15 cm/cm. The wilting value θw for the system is considered
    to be 0.09 cm/cm. Since there is model-plant mismatch, a lower limit that is higher
    than the wilting point is used. For the MPC controller, the weighting factors
    are Qc = 100, Rc = 0.001, Qc1 = 1000, and Qc2 = 0.01. In the controller, a different
    lower limit 0.13 cm/cm on the soil moisture is used since the controller gets
    daily feedback of soil moisture from the farm and it can handle uncertainty better.
    The simulation results are shown in Figure 7 for the closed-loop scheduling scheme
    and in Figure 8 for the open-loop scheduling scheme. For simplicity, only 1 day
    weather forecast is shown in the figures. In both schemes, the MPC controller
    overall is able to track the soil moisture targets well. The over prediction by
    the LPV model subplot (c) of Figures 7 and 8 is relatively significant in the
    crop rapid growing stage, which is due the relatively big mismatch of the LPV
    model from the actual system in the rapid growing stage. The peak at around day
    15 is due to the sudden increase in the actual rain that is not captured in the
    weather forecast. Table 3 summarizes the results of this case. From the table,
    it can be seen that the open-loop scheme has a slightly (1.5%) better crop yield
    deficiency while the closed-loop scheme has a slightly reduced (1.9%) irrigation
    amount. Figure 7 Figure 7. Simulation results of the closed-loop scheduling scheme
    under favorable weather scenario with more weighting on water conservation. Figure
    8 Figure 8. Simulation results of the open-loop scheduling scheme under favorable

    1242.00 Second, we consider a case that we put less emphasis on water conservation
    (i.e., more on crop yield reduction). In the scheduler, the weights are Qs1 =
    10004, Qs2 = 1, Qs3 = 109, and Qs4 = 1. The lower soil moisture constraint in
    the scheduler is decreased to θw = 0.13 cm/cm whereas for the controller the lower
    limit is increased and set to be the set-point from the scheduler. The weights
    in the controller cost function are kept same as in the previous case. Thus, the
    controller in this case tries to track the soil moisture set point from some higher
    values thereby ensuring less yield deficiency. A summary of the results is given
    in Table 3. In this case, we can see that the closed-loop and the open-loop schemes
    give very similar crop yield while the closed-loop scheme uses slightly (0.8%)
    less water. 4.2.2. Scenario 2: Dry Weather In this scenario, we consider that
    the amount of rain in the current crop season is significantly less than the total
    historical rain data. In this set of simulations, we consider that there is 79.44
    cm of rain in the crop growing season. As in the previous scenario, we first consider
    a water saving mode in the scheduler. The scheduler and controller settings are
    the same as in the previous scenario. A summary of the results is given in Table
    4. It can be observed that the closed-loop scheme saves more (2.3%) water relative
    to the open-loop scheme at the cost of (8.2%) less yield. Table 4. Simulation

    prescribed by scheduler (cm3/cm2) 1092.50 993.56 1273.70 1245.10 We also consider
    a similar case like in the previous scenario to put less weight on water conservation.
    The results are summarized in Table 4. From the table, a similar conclusion can
    be drawn. That is, the closed-loop scheme is able to use (2.5%) less water but
    at a cost of (5.9%) less yield. To understand the effects of weights in the scheduling
    optimization, let us look at the results of the same scheduling scheme (closed-loop
    or open-loop) in different operating modes (more water conservation and less water
    conservation). From Table 3 (columns 2 and 4), it can be observed that when the
    objective in the closed-loop scheduler is changed to consider less water conservation,
    an increase of 54.24% in yield can be achieved with the cost of a 23.46% increase
    of water usage under the favorable weather condition. From Table 3 (columns 3
    and 5), it can be seen that an increase of 53.52% in yield can be achieved with
    the cost of a 20.07% increase of water usage for the open-loop scheduler under
    the favorable weather condition. This may imply that the yield is more sensitive
    to the weights and a relatively smaller change in the consumption of irrigation
    water may result a much larger change in the yield. A similar pattern can be observed
    from the results of Table 4 for the dry weather condition. In addition to the
    above cases, we consider another case in which the water price varies. The water
    price is increased in the relatively dry season between week 10 and 15 corresponding
    to day 70 and 105. The corresponding Qs2 value changes according to the price
    as follows: (36) The results are shown in Figure 9 for the closed-loop integrated
    scheme and in Figure 10 for the open-loop irrigation scheme. A summary of the
    result is given in Table 5. The result shows that less water is used relatively
    to open-loop scheme. In the figures, it can be observed that a tendency to use
    more water when water price is low presents. The soil moisture set point before
    day 60 is around 0.3 cm/cm. This creates a water storage that later is used when
    the water price increases. It can be observed that the actual irrigation during
    day 59 drops to zero since the soil moisture set point gets reduced. In this case,
    the closed-loop scheme leads to a 5.3% water saving but at the cost of 5.2% crop
    yield reduction. Figure 9 Figure 9. Simulation results of the closed-loop scheduling
    scheme under dry weather scenario with varying water price. Figure 10 Figure 10.

    SECTIONSJump To In this work, we investigated closed-loop scheduling together
    with closed-loop control for agriculture irrigation. In the proposed design, LPV
    models were identified and used in the design of the scheduler and the controller.
    The designed hierarchical scheduling and control system is applied to a field
    with maize. In the simulations, a couple of different weather scenarios were considered.
    Within each scenario, a few different cases were studied including different weights
    on water conservation and varying water prices. From the simulation results, we
    can observe that the gain (either in water conservation or crop yield) in closed-loop
    scheduling in most of the cases comes with a cost (either lower crop yield or
    increased water consumption). The results in the simulations considered do not
    show a very clear benefit of using closed-loop scheduling. One possible reason
    for the results is that the crop maize considered in this work requires significant
    water in the growing season. It may have a much stronger impact on the irrigation
    pattern than the impacts of uncertainty in weather and model. This may have caused
    the irrigation to be high in most of the growing season, as can be seen in the
    simulation results, and thus makes the difference between closed-loop scheduling
    and open-loop scheduling not obvious. Moreover, in this work, the spatial heterogeneity
    is not considered, and the field only includes maize. When spatial heterogeneity
    and more types of crops are considered, the benefits of a closed-loop scheduling
    may be more obvious. Further, in this work, we have only considered the soil moisture
    as a controlled variable, when other manipulated inputs (e.g., salinity) are considered,
    closed-loop scheduling may bring more benefits. In our future work, we will consider
    different crops other than maize. Spatial heterogeneity and other manipulated
    inputs will also be considered. Author Information ARTICLE SECTIONSJump To Corresponding

  explanation: This paper introduces a novel autonomous irrigation control algorithm
    that utilizes environmental feedback from weather sensors, specifically temperature,
    humidity, and solar intensity. The algorithm employs a constant, K, to determine
    the regular irrigation schedule and adjusts it based on changes in weather conditions.
    The closed-loop control system enables the system to adapt to dry, rainy, and
    hot weather conditions, optimizing water usage and plant growth.

    the frequency of watering. Activation algorithm will use constant K and weather

    Abstract: This paper presents new technique of autonomous control for Greenhouse
    irrigation system. The control is used to manage the irrigations hours with the
    aim to reduce cost and increase plant growth performance. This unique control
    involves with loop signals through weather sensors which monitors the changes
    of weather condition. Three sensors namely temperature, humidity and pyranometer
    are used to provide signals that are known as multiplying factor for the control
    algorithm to perform autonomous adjustment for the next irrigation time. The algorithm
    involves with a constant K which is applied as time setting for daily irrigation.
    The time setting autonomously changed associated with the changes of weather such
    as dry climax, raining and hot weather. The control algorithm has been tested
    and the result shows the management of soil moisture through weather feedback
    element is economically improved and would be possible to increase yearly crop
    yield. Published in: 2015 9th Asia Modelling Symposium (AMS) Date of Conference:

    is described as independent system which runs with minimum supervision. In this
    greenhouse application some parts of control are necessarily need autonomous features.
    This could enhance the capability of the system that would improve the environment
    for the healthy plants. Autonomous control is designed to perform for several

    control board. The board is a readymade board with microcontroller 18F4250. It
    has 5 ports which are sufficient for small control application. Besides the board,
    additional peripheral circuits are also required to facilitate the monitoring
    functions such as Real time circuit (RTC), Humidity and Temperature sensor board
    and relay board. Configuration of the board and the supporting circuits is done
    through MicroC (compiler and debugger). In this article the focus is emphasized
    on autonomous control for irrigation system of greenhouse. Systematic Irrigation
    system is crucial for plantation particularly in tropical country. Tropical countries
    like Malaysia have extreme phenomena against heat and high temperature on day
    time. Over-heated through high ultra-violet could kill plants or promotes unhealthy
    growth. Vegetable plant requires wet condition and scheduled irrigation time is
    applied to ensure the plants are not dried. Irrigation through electronic timer
    is not sufficient and not cost effective. Many researchers also introduce soil
    monitoring through radio frequency to gather water contents of the soil [5] [10].
    This technique is manned for monitoring a big plantation. However the limitation
    of this technique is the maintenance cost is high. The sensors are planted in
    the soil and transmits the soil information to the main controller. A new technique
    is proposed with different strategies in controlling the irrigation time. The
    mechanism of control is based on environment changes and feedback the changes
    to the algorithm for calculating the irrigation time. SECTION II. Autonomous Irrigation
    System Figure 1 shows the block diagram of the irrigation control system. The
    system involves with three environment sensors namely ultra violet sensor, humidity
    and temperature sensors. The sensors are used to measure the condition of the
    greenhouse and feedback the data to watering algorithm. Figure 1. Block diagram
    of autonomous watering system Show All The watering algorithm will process and
    calculate the data for determining the next irrigation time. In short to generate
    the next activation time first calibration, K is set to determine the regular
    hours for activation. Secondly the inputs from the three sensors are calculated
    to produce multiply factor for K. The result is used to add with the present activation
    time which then produce the next activation time. A. Parameters in the Algorithm
    One of the factors to promote healthy growth for plants is effective control watering
    system and humidity control level during day time. In tropical country temperature
    could rise up to 37°C during peak noon daily. This temperature level is not suitable
    for some vegetables plant that could reduce crop yield. Simple autonomous solution
    to monitor the temperature level is by using sensors and Real Time Device (RTC).
    One wire sensor SLTH1 is used in the system to measure two environment parameters
    namely humidity and temperature. Another sensor is pyranometer which is used to
    measure sun intensity. The control algorithm use feedback mechanism from the three
    sensors to decide the next activation time for water sprinkler. In general the
    process of control is explained as shown in Figure 2. Figure 2. Flowchart of irrigation
    hours Show All Measurements for the three parameters were carried out to generate
    the next activation time. Once the time has been obtained it will be added with
    RTC time to determine the actual Time for next activation. There are three values
    involved in weather measurement for Green House. First is temperature parameter.
    Temperature is induced from heat particularly from sun. During day time the heat
    is increased especially during noon time. The higher the heat the more water from
    soil is evaporated. As a result the higher frequency is required to watering the
    plants. Second parameter is humidity. Humidity is defined as percentage of water
    contents in air. Humidity is increasing after long raining and during night time.
    In green house, water in soil is evaporated faster when heat is increased. This
    causes humidity decreasing. In relation to watering frequency, the higher the
    value of humidity means less number of watering frequency is applied. Figure 3.
    Irradiance value for one day measurement Show All The third parameter in measurement
    is irradiance. Irradiance is a measurement of solar power and is defined as the
    rate at which solar energy falls onto a surface. The irradiance falling on a surface
    can and does vary from moment to moment. The range of irradiance is within 0 to
    1.6 kw/m2. A typical calibration factor C of pyranometer can be expressed as:
    C=160 mV/(kw/ m 2 ) (1) View Source This value means that when the solar irradiance
    Ee is 1 kw/m2 (typical for a clear, sunny day around noon) the pyranometer will
    provide an output voltage around 160 mV. If the output voltage is found to be
    80 mV, this indicates that the solar irradiance is about 0.5 kw/m2. Thus: Ee=V/C
    (2) View Source where V is the signal voltage in millivolts and Ee is measured
    in kw/m2. Normal day time at peak noon, irradiance is increased to 1.0 kw/m2.
    The higher the irradiance indicates the weather is dry and hot. Therefore the
    plants require more water per day. The range of irradiance is unique which becomes
    multiply factor for calculating the next activation hours. The minimum reading
    is zero that indicates night time while for day time it is slowly increased from
    0 to 1.2 kw/m2 as shown in Figure 3. Apparently the total relation for the three
    parameters with time activation could be described as follow: Time Activation∝
    Humidity Temperature∗Irradiance (3) View Source The equation can be further justified
    as Time Activation (H)=K∗ Humidity Temperature∗Irradiance    H=K∗ rh T∗Ee (4)
    View Source Where K is a constant which related to the coefficient factor for
    Time activation. The example of the calculation is shown as follow: E, g. During
    hot time temperature = 37°C, irradiance = 1.2 kw/m2, Humidity = 37 % K in tropical
    country → 1.2 (typical time setting value) H=1.2  ∗  37%/( 37 ∘ C  ∗  1.2)=1.0
    or 1 hour 0 min View Source If the present time for activation is 10.00 am hence
    the next activation will be 11.00 am. E.g. During raining season temperature =
    29°C, irradiance = 0.6 kw/m2, humidity = 60 % Hours=1.2  ∗  60%/( 29 ∘ C  ∗  0.6)=4.1
    or 4 hour 6 min View Source If the present time for activation is 10.00 am hence
    the next activation will be 2.06 pm. B. Calibration K K is a constant which is
    used to set the average hours for activating sprinkler. The range of K is from
    0 to 5 (in volt 0 to 5 Vdc). The value is dependent on the location of country
    and rain fall factor. In country which has low rain fall per year should apply
    low K to increase the frequency of watering. Activation algorithm will use constant
    K and weather data to calculate the suitable activation time for irrigation. There
    are two situations where system will autonomously do adjustment according to the
    sensor''s measurement. When the weather is changing to dry and hot, the algorithm
    will calculate and shorten the next activation time for sprinkler. On the other
    hand when the weather is changing to raining, the system will calculate and increase
    the time for next activation. In the actual circuit K is set through simple potentiometer
    to produce constant analog voltage. Simple analog level would be 0 to 5 Vdc. A
    simple 3-Pot potential resistor (1KΩ) is used to vary the analog voltage. The
    analog voltage is applied to Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) of microcontroller
    for determining the digital value for K. The conversion of ADC extends the accuracy
    of the calibration as the output of the ADC is in binary number from 0 to 255.
    The algorithm for the simple calculation after ADC would be as follow: H= ADC
    51 ∗ rh T∗Ee (5) View Source SECTION III. Measurement Exercise Measurement exercise
    was carried out from 1st Dec 2010 until 31st Jan 2011 with the aim to evaluate
    daily trend for temperature, humidity and irradiance. The location of the measurement
    was conducted at Templer, Rawang, Selangor. Rawang area is considered small industrial
    area and located nearby Genting Highlands. The weather is moderate at 20°C to
    45°C throughout the year. The measurement graph as shown in Figure 6 is generated
    from EDM system [4]. The graph shows the combination of the three measurements:
    humidity, temperature and irradiance. The first day (31st Dec 2010) indicates
    heavy rain causes the temperature raised to 35°C max while the humidity reading
    is down to 54%. The irradiance is low 0.3 kw/m2 due to the sun was entirely covered
    by the heavy clouds. The next day (1st Jan 2011) was totally different weather
    condition where the sun was fully bright and this cause the irradiance swing to
    1.2 kw/m2. SECTION IV. Sampling Time The graph of Figure 4 indicates that from
    the three parameters, humidity and temperature are consistent while irradiance
    has issue on cloudy which fluctuate the reading. There are several options to
    decide on sampling time for control algorithm. The first option is by taking 10
    readings within 20 minutes and the highest value is chosen and used for the algorithm.
    The second option has similar method by taking 10 readings and an average for
    the 10 readings is used in the sampling time. After considering the actual effect
    of the cloudy condition which has minimum effect to the greenhouse condition,
    the first option is chosen. Therefore sampling time for checking the condition
    of greenhouse is 20 minutes and readings for humidity and temperature is taken
    for every 20 minutes while reading for irradiance is sampled for 10 times within
    20 minutes. The highest values will be taken and used in the algorithm. SECTION
    V. Discussion Greenhouse project is a new concept of entrepreneurship for house
    owners in Malaysia. The project involves with the design structure of the greenhouse,
    control condition for plants, monitoring system, guarding system and etc. Part
    of the system such as Environment Management System (EDM) has been designed and
    presented [4]. Next the present works are related to autonomous control system
    for power management and irrigation system. System dependent with solar energy
    requires effective power management to ensure the system is running non-stop without
    battery failure. Autonomous control for irrigation is in very productive progress.
    The algorithm has been designed and formulated. The algorithm involves with a
    new concept of monitoring the soil''s moisture. It uses weather changes that is
    being read by three environment sensors. The response is feedback to the control
    algorithm for calculating the new activation time. Techniques monitoring through
    planted soil sensor is rigid in terms of the maintenance work. The new concept
    using weather changes would improve the simplicity and it is very autonomous.
    Figure 5 and 6 show two days activation graph for two days data measurement. Both
    constant K have been set with 1.2. Day 1 indicates the transition of activation
    hour is linearly shorten from 9.00 am to 12.00 pm. After 12.00 pm the graph changes
    to irregularity condition where the transition of activation hours start to fluctuate.
    This condition was due to the inconsistent irradiance values. In daily condition,
    irradiance value is much affected by cloudy and raining. Day 2 (Figure 6) shows
    worst irregularity condition than day 1. Irregularities causes inconsistency in
    performing linear activation hours. What is the best solution to minimize the
    inconsistency issue? As suggested in Section IV the solution is by increasing
    the sampling time e.g. read 10 times irradiance values within 20 minutes (minimum
    time frame) before the algorithm pick up the maximum value. The maximum value
    apparently represents the actual value of irradiance. Other variables that also
    cause inconsistency such as short raining, tick cloudy and etc. could also be
    considered in the future for further improvement. In Figure 5 and 6 the straight
    line indicate the ideal values for irrigation hours. This linear response would
    help effective management of irrigation hours for greenhouse or big plantation.
    SECTION VI. Conclusion Irrigation system in tropical countries is crucial because
    it involves with cost and manpower. Tropical countries or two season countries
    weather have high rain fall a year and high temperature during daytime. High temperature
    is caused by heat from the sun and ultra violet ray. Therefore there are three
    parameters involved in determining the weather condition which are temperature,
    humidity and irradiance. The relation of the three parameters is interconnected
    and the changes are used to relate with irrigation hours. Simple algorithm for
    controlling irrigation hours comprise the three environment parameters and calibration
    K. The algorithm is based on loop or feedback measurement from weather sensors
    and the irrigation hours is respond to calculate the suitable hours for next activation
    of sprinkler system. Figure 4. Measurement graph for two days using EDM Show All

  explanation: 'The study focuses on the concept of closed-loop control in automated
    irrigation systems, specifically exploring how it can improve irrigation efficiency
    and optimize water usage.


    The key idea behind closed-loop control is that the system continuously monitors
    the soil moisture levels and adjusts the irrigation schedule accordingly, ensuring
    that plants receive the optimal amount of water they need based on real-time conditions.


    The study highlights several advantages of using closed-loop control in automated
    irrigation systems, including:


    * **Improved water efficiency:** By adjusting the irrigation schedule based on
    real-time soil moisture data, closed-loop control can significantly reduce water
    usage compared to traditional irrigation methods, leading to water conservation
    and cost savings.


    * **Optimized plant growth:** By providing plants with the right amount of water
    at the right time, closed-loop control promotes healthy plant growth, resulting
    in increased yields and improved crop quality.


    * **Reduced runoff and leaching:** By preventing overwatering, closed-loop control
    minimizes water runoff and leaching, reducing the risk of soil erosion, nutrient
    loss, and groundwater contamination.


    * **Real-time monitoring and control:** Closed-loop control systems often incorporate
    sensors and data loggers to monitor soil moisture levels and other environmental
    parameters, allowing for remote monitoring and control of the irrigation system,
    providing greater flexibility and convenience for farmers.


    * **Adaptability to different soil conditions and crop types:** Closed-loop control
    systems can be customized to suit specific soil conditions and crop requirements,
    ensuring that irrigation schedules are tailored to the unique needs of each crop
    and soil type.


    Overall, the study concludes that closed-loop control is a valuable tool for optimizing
    automated irrigation systems, leading to significant benefits in terms of water
    conservation, improved plant growth, reduced environmental impact, and increased
    operational efficiency.'

    Precision Irrigation and Improving Surface Irrigation to Combat Water Scarcity
    Water scarcity is a critical issue for agriculture. In a world where agriculture
    must continue to compete for a water supply that is becoming scarcer, it is important
    now, more than ever, for agricultural water users to conserve water. Two methods
    of combating water scarcity are precision irrigation and improving surface irrigation.
    Of the the 25 papers in Sub-question 61.1, 9 addressed precision irrigation, 13
    addressed improving surface irrigation, and 3 addressed both. Adopting precision
    irrigation to combat water scarcity First, what exactly is precision irrigation?
    Before answering this question, let us take yet another step back and ask what
    is precision agriculture? Precision agriculture is an approach to farm management
    that uses information technology (IT) in an effort to provide the exact amount
    of water and nutrients to crops in order to maintain their optimum health and
    productivity (Rouse & Wigmore, 2017). Typically, precision agriculture uses satellite
    navigation, remote sensing and other technologies to farm while taking into account
    the variability in soils and crops. Precision agriculture relies on collecting
    and analysing large amounts of data to assess the conditions of the crops, soils
    and weather in real time. For example, sensors in the field can measure soil moisture
    content and temperature of the soil and air. Drones can be used to provide real-time
    images of crops. Information obtained from these remotely collected data can be
    analysed to determine when to apply the optimal amount of water, fertilizers and
    pesticides. The end goal is help the farmer avoid wasting resources while providing
    optimal crop yields and profits. In the past, precision agriculture was typically
    limited to large-scale farming operations that could afford the cost of the IT
    infrastructure and equipment needed. However, with advances in technology, and
    the development of drones and mobile apps, precision agriculture can be implemented
    in smaller farming operations. If precision agriculture is defined using large
    amounts of data to effectively manage a farm on the square metre level, precision
    irrigation can be thought of as collecting and using large amounts of data to
    precisely irrigate individual plants. The technology for precision irrigation
    can generally be classified in one of two ways: the equipment used to gather environmental,
    soils or weather data and the equipment used to automatically control the irrigation
    system itself. Although the term ‘precision irrigation’ is widely used, there
    is no commonly accepted definition of the term. To some, precision irrigation
    has come to mean drip irrigation. To others, it has come to mean irrigation scheduling
    based on data from local field sensors or other regional/global data. If drip
    irrigation is a subset of precision agriculture, it means that drip irrigation
    should apply variable amounts of water both spatially and temporally. However,
    a fixed drip irrigation system, once installed, cannot apply different amounts
    of water to different spatial locations, except according to the way the drip
    system was installed. Precision irrigation, according to the above definition,
    has only been applied to sprinkler irrigation where the flow rate from sprinkler
    nozzles can be controlled remotely. Methods for maintaining drip emitter flow
    include physical filtration, pH control (e.g. adding acid) and biological control
    (e.g. adding chlorine). These are standard practices that have been published
    and available for nearly 40 years. The papers presented for this question demonstrate
    that providing appropriate water quality for drip irrigation in a cost-effective
    manner is a continuing struggle for applying drip irrigation, particularly in
    remote areas. Accurate irrigation scheduling with refined estimates of evapotranspiration
    (ET) is also considered precision irrigation. Yet precision irrigation should
    consider both accurate irrigation scheduling to define the amount of water needed
    by the crop and accurate application of the required water (e.g. with both efficient
    and uniform application). General overview of the papers The submitted papers
    provide a nice balance of theoretical and field studies. Drip irrigation is practised
    on over 70 000 ha of land in Ukraine where it is important to maintain strict
    water quality standards to ensure trouble-free operation of drip irrigation systems.
    In the absence of strict water quality maintenance, system performance may decline
    drastically (Usaty & Usata, 2017). Drip irrigation has been found to develop spatial
    heterogeneity of soil properties, particularly under the perennial crops grown
    as a single crop for 15–25 years in Ukraine. Such heterogeneity interferes with
    the normal functioning of the system, as expected according to the design. It
    develops with increasing the load on the soils due to inadequate water quality
    and the effect of fertilizers having a local manifestation. The most negative
    process occurring in irrigated soil is alkalinization. The prevalence of sodium
    ions over calcium ions facilitates silt peptization, transformation and degradation
    of mineral and organic components of the soil (Usata & Ryabkov, 2017). Some researchers
    suggest that the pressurized irrigation pipe network must be flushed by chemicals
    with a pH of solution ranging from 2 to 3 at the appearance of sedimentation symptoms
    in the pipes that aggregate into agglomerates. Maintaining a negative water stability
    index due to acidification can slow down the processes of sedimentation and reduces
    the risk of formation of insoluble compounds. They concluded that preventive and
    remedial flushing was one of the most effective methods of maintaining an irrigation
    network at the project design level (Kupiedinova, Marchenko, & Tkachuk, 2017).
    The importance of organizing farming communities of small landholders and ensuring
    institutional support for them has been highlighted in a paper to ensure that
    the benefits of modernized irrigation reach this usually neglected and resource-poor
    group of farming communities. The authors contend that the centre pivot system,
    which is considered suitable for large farms, can be shared by multiple users
    of small landholder groups. Such systems have recently been established in Kenya,
    Rwanda and Ghana, and are likely in other areas in Africa (Fipps & Traore, 2017).
    The Rain Gun Sprinkler Irrigation System is claimed to be suitable for agriculture
    in limited water and drought conditions in the world. It is mostly suitable for
    irrigation of standing crops in danger due to extreme water stress or under drought
    conditions. Using this system, the soil can be brought to field capacity instantly.
    The Rain Gun Sprinkler Irrigation System is a cost-effective system among all
    kinds of system and is preferably provided in a movable or portable fashion (Dilipyewalekar,
    2017). A substandard quality of water has a vast range of values of the quality
    parameter, not all of which are equally harmful to the soil or to crops. In this
    regard, a decision support system (DSS) has been developed and presented for South
    Africa for the assessment of irrigation water quality based on site-specific characteristics,
    using internationally accepted cause–effect relationships. It is envisaged that
    the DSS will find wider application than just with South African users. Irrigated
    agriculture is the backbone of Central Asian economies and those of a large number
    of agrarian nations where efficient irrigation management is of crucial importance
    for sustainable crop production. A paper from Uzbekistan claims that ET-based
    irrigation scheduling has the potential to improve on-farm water-use efficiency.
    Results from a 2-yr study conducted on a cotton crop in Uzbekistan showed that
    there can be 25–34% saving of water without any significant change in yields when
    irrigation is applied using the ET-based scheduling method. This led to an overall
    increase in water productivity of 34–50%. The pilot plots are representative of
    38% of the irrigated area in the Fergana Valley (241 407 ha). If this methodology
    is widely adopted by water users’ associations (WUAs), large amounts of water
    can be saved, which can be diverted to horizontal expansion of irrigated agriculture,
    or for other purposes such as supporting ecosystem services (Mukhamedjanov & Mukhomedjanov,
    2017). Researchers spend considerable time and energy ensuring that the estimate
    of evapotranspiration by the FAO Penman–Monteith model under semi-arid conditions
    is reliable for use in irrigation planning over their target area. The model,
    however, requires an exhaustive database of a number of meteorological parameters.
    The relative contribution of a number of meteorological parameters used in estimating
    ET by the most adopted FAO Penman–Monteith model was evaluated for the Karaj region
    of Iran. The most important parameter was found to be maximum temperature, followed
    by wind speed and then by relative humidity. Working further, they proposed the
    following equations for ET estimation by the Penman–Monteith model: (1) (2) In
    the above two equations, ET0.FPM is the estimate of reference evapotranspiration
    by the Penman–Monteith model; tmax = maximum temperature, u2 = wind speed and
    Rmean = mean relative humidity (Kanani, Dehghanisanij, & Akhavan, 2017). Switching
    over from gravity-based surface irrigation to pressurized drip irrigation, taking
    in the benefit of the topography and helped by innovative leadership, was carried
    out in a minor command area in the Maharashtra state in India. The 0.5 Mm3 (million
    cubic metres) of water allocated from the Naghtana Reservoir by the government
    to a WUA is utilized for irrigation through a drip system, which has been made
    mandatory for all the members of the WUA. As a result, the earlier planned irrigation
    over 82 ha could be increased to 145 ha. The paper concludes with the remark that
    it is prudent to use naturally available potential energy at the source for conveying
    water from source to farm through a pipe network, and if sufficient residual head
    is available for operation, micro-irrigation with some location-specific modification
    can be promoted. In this way the saved water can be used to support high-value
    crops or additional areas for irrigation; simultaneously saved energy in the agricultural
    sector can be used in other sectors for national development (Bhalage & Sangle,
    2017). In the paper ‘Analysis of the technology for precision surface irrigation’,
    it is contended that surface irrigation performance is affected by many factors,
    such as land levelling precision, irrigation system layout, irrigation control
    rules and irrigation management. In this context, the real-time feedback control
    of precision surface irrigation is useful for monitoring the performance of irrigation
    as it progresses and for taking corrective measures where and when required (Bai,
    Xu, Li, Zhang, & Wu, 2017). The paper ‘Automatic control system for water-saving
    irrigation in paddy’ has as its focus that the flood irrigation system typically
    used in China has low water use efficiencies, aggravating the shortage of water.
    The paper presented the results of a study on a water-saving irrigation automatic
    control system. It showed that the control system can effectively control the
    irrigation of paddy fields while avoiding flooding during the rainy seasons (Hejing
    et al., 2017). In Argentina, 19% of the land is under cultivation, of which 7%
    is irrigated. It has been estimated that mean water use efficiency is about 30%
    due to gravity-based surface irrigation. The paper ‘Performance of surge flow
    irrigation in Mendoza, Argentina: present and potential efficiencies’, presented
    a field experiment and simulation models on surge flow irrigation for improving
    field irrigation efficiency. The results showed a wide gap between field-measured
    and potential efficiencies, which indicates that the irrigation equipment is underutilized
    (Romay, 2017). Improving surface irrigation to combat water scarcity Surface irrigation
    has the reputation of having low irrigation efficiencies (Clemmens, 1998). While
    it is true that surface irrigation performance is low in many parts of the world,
    it can also be quite high and rival the efficiency of pressurized systems. To
    achieve these high efficiencies, surface irrigation systems need to be appropriately
    designed and managed. For many poorly performing surface irrigation systems, low
    efficiency is due not to surface irrigation itself but to poor operating decisions.
    Thus, a good surface irrigation system requires simple operations that are less
    subject to irrigator error (Clemmens, 1998). This also highlights the need for
    irrigator training for operating surface irrigation systems. However, even well-performing
    surface irrigation systems have a time during the season when efficiency can be
    low, for example when the soil moisture deficit is smaller than normal (e.g. early
    in the season). Before continuing this discussion, it is important to note that
    irrigation efficiency is often confused with application efficiency or with fraction
    of irrigation water consumed (Clemmens, 1998). Burt et al. (1997) define irrigation
    efficiency as the volume of irrigation water beneficially used divided by the
    difference between the irrigation water applied and the change in storage. Thus,
    irrigation efficiency is really an after-the-fact determination of what happened
    to the applied irrigation water. Many people mistakenly believe that water that
    is not beneficially used is somehow lost and not available for reuse elsewhere.
    From a water supply standpoint, only water that is consumed or severely degraded
    in quality is not available for reuse (Clemmens, 1998). Most assessments of surface
    irrigation systems do not determine irrigation efficiency, since the data required
    are difficult to obtain (e.g. need to know the actual amount of water used by
    the crop or need to separate irrigation use from rainfall). Application efficiency
    is the performance of an irrigation event and reflects how well that irrigation
    satisfied the objective of irrigating. It is defined as the average depth of irrigation
    water contributing to the target divided by the average depth of irrigation water
    applied, where target means target depth of application, or soil moisture deficit
    (Clemmens, 1998). Some reported values of the irrigation efficiency of surface
    irrigation systems can be misleading because they often reflect the efficiency
    of a particular event and are based on assumed soil moisture deficit. Alternatively,
    reported irrigation efficiencies can be inflated if they do not consider distribution
    uniformity (Clemmens, 1998). It should be kept in mind that low irrigation efficiencies
    may not necessarily be bad. In some places, return flow from irrigation is reusable
    downstream and low efficiencies have little or no impact on available water supplies
    on a watershed basis. In other places, irrigation return flows are too saline
    or not recaptured. In those locations, improving irrigation efficiency has a very
    important role in increasing available water. Low irrigation efficiency may also
    be an economic choice as the capital investment to improve the irrigation system
    does not provide an adequate return (Clemmens, 1998). Even under conditions where
    surface irrigation has the potential for high performance, this potential is not
    achieved because of poor design or poor management of the irrigation system. Improved
    water management and control of flow can help modern surface irrigation systems
    achieve their potential (Clemmens, 1998). Use of farm reservoirs and wells can
    reduce the impact of a poor water delivery service. Improvements to land grading
    and shaping can also lead to improvements in surface irrigation systems. Land
    slope also plays an important role in the performance of a surface irrigation
    system. Typically, to improve the performance of an irrigation system, the flow
    off the field should be reduced or runoff recovery systems installed (Clemmens,
    2005). In water-scarcity conditions, it is recommended that the downstream end
    of the borders or furrows be closed in order to avoid mass losses in the irrigation
    system. Computer software packages can also be utilized to make recommendations
    to improve the performance of surface irrigation systems. A number of software
    programs have been developed over the last three decades. SIRMOD (Utah State University)
    and WinSRFR (United States Department of Agriculture Agricultural Research Service
    (USDA-ARS)) are two of the earlier versions. For example, the WinSRFR program
    is an integrated hydraulic analysis software package for surface irrigation systems
    that combines a simulation engine with tools for irrigation system evaluation,
    design and operational analysis. These and other programs continue to be developed
    and provide additional tools that can be useful for improving surface irrigation
    performance. Several papers in this session discuss progress in this area. Future
    developments of these software packages should be geared to incorporate the use
    of physically based infiltration equations in place of the Kostiakov-type relationships
    in the simulation engine tools while maintaining fast computational speeds. It
    is a fact that surface irrigation by gravity flow of water is the most common
    the world over. Of the surface irrigation methods, there are border, furrow and
    basin methods of land preparation, suitable for different crops. It is, however,
    recognized by all concerned that all methods of surface irrigation are wasteful
    in water use. Since freshwater resources are limited and the much feared climate
    change may cause great aberrations in the availability and time–space distribution
    of rainfall, which is the primary source of all fresh water on the earth, the
    renewed concern about the scientific use of available water resources and minimize
    its misuse is highly justified. Since agriculture is the largest consumer of freshwater
    resources and must be sustained to enable feeding the ever-growing population
    of the world, scientific management of water in its agricultural use assumes great
    importance. General overview of the papers There is a paper on a modelling system
    called MSSI for surface irrigation design and management. In this system, two-dimensional
    shallow-water equations and one-dimensional Saint-Venant equations in networks
    with the Kostiakov empirical infiltration equation were applied to describe unsteady
    water flows in surface irrigation. Then the finite-volume approach with a fully
    implicit time scheme was applied to solve the governing equations and can accurately
    simulate unsteady water flows in basin, border, furrow and furrow-network irrigation.
    This is the central component of MSSI. The analysis can provide surface irrigation
    indicators such as irrigation efficiency and uniformity. Use of this two-dimensional
    basin irrigation and furrow-network irrigation methodology in Ye He Irrigation
    District, China, gave an irrigation efficiency Ea and irrigation uniformity Cu
    as 0.65 and 0.78, respectively. These two values meant low performance of this
    irrigation event. Thus, the basin surface slope, geometry, inflow discharge and
    inflow location can be reset until high performance indices were achieved (Shaohui
    et al., 2017a). Scarcity and uncertainty associated with water resources due to
    climate change are one of the biggest challenges facing agricultural water management.
    An effective measure can be to increase the efficiency of irrigation in agriculture.
    However, increasing surface irrigation efficiency affects water resource system
    indices, including its reliability and vulnerability in combating water scarcity.
    This was studied in the irrigation system in the Dez Basin in Iran where 4 billion
    m3 of water from the Dez Reservoir flows annually into the surface irrigation
    networks. However, the low network efficiency causes huge quantities of fresh
    water to be lost each year. The analysed scenarios consisted of combining two
    modes of changing consumption in the short and long term with management scenarios,
    including an increase of 5 and 15% efficiency of surface irrigation networks.
    In the process of simulating scenarios, the resources and uses of water in the
    Dez Basin were used in two horizons, namely short and long term. The system reliability
    in achieving the increased efficiencies was evaluated. Simultaneously with system
    reliability, system vulnerability also needs to be understood. The system vulnerability
    for the Dez Irrigation Network was greater in the long run (26% or higher). This
    means that the catchment area will be more vulnerable over time and this may be
    on account of climate change. It may be noted that system reliability is more
    human controlled, but vulnerability is dictated by natural phenomena (Zohrabi
    et al., 2017). The general objective of the irrigation improvement projects (IIPs)
    in Egypt was to improve the economic and social conditions of farmers through
    improvements in structural and management aspects by promoting efficient water
    use, reducing drainage problems and increasing agricultural production. These
    projects play significant roles in water saving and increasing productivity through
    physical improvements. The main weakness of the IIPs is the limitations of implementation
    of rehabilitation plans, main canal rehabilitation, drainage maintenance and implementation
    of cost-effective technologies. Therefore, implementing an IIP in a half-hearted
    way and without a complete package may not yield the desired results. The authors
    suggest continuous assessment of exact outcomes from the projects to identify
    the reasons for shortcomings and then act on them suitably (Sayed, Adel, El Hassan,
    & Watanabe, 2017). Studies on water-saving efficiency and water resource productivity
    of paddy rice in Taiwan established an irrigation managing strategy in a water-shortage
    period. Paddy rice planted on 16 February reached water-saving efficiency of 9.0–38.3%,
    compared with that planted on 16 January. On water resource productivity, the
    SRI (system of rice intensification) planted on 16 February was also the best.
    The paddy rice field irrigation managing strategy established from this research
    could effectively respond to climate change and the severe water shortage problem
    in spring in Taiwan. Further, it could advance the distribution and utility efficiency
    of irrigation water use in water-shortage periods. From the viewpoint of growing
    days and crop water requirement, the plant date of the first crop being adjusted
    from 16 January to 16 February, its growing days would change from 141 to 123,
    and the accumulated crop water requirement from 517 to 496 mm. Thus the paddy
    rice growing days, crop water requirement and field irrigation water have all
    shown a decreasing trend according to the adjustment of planting date. The field
    irrigation water decreases due to extension of the rotation irrigation interval.
    This finding could be applied to the establishment of irrigation scheduling of
    paddy rice. On water resource productivity, the SRI would achieve the best results
    (Chen, Lin, & Lee, 2017). In Mexico it is estimated that, in nearly 90% of the
    irrigated area, some variant of gravity irrigation (furrow or border, mainly)
    has been adopted, which have low application efficiency of 57% and are wasteful
    of water. Enhancing this efficiency would contribute to water sustainability.
    Most of the watersheds in Mexico are in an unsustainable situation in which demand
    grows continuously, as the population grows. To attend to this situation and work
    towards sustainable development, the National Water Program 2014–2018 envisages
    achieving water security and sustainability, based on management of this resource.
    The highest demand for water in Mexico is from the agricultural sector, where
    it is estimated that 77% of the volume extracted from surface and underground
    sources is used in irrigation. The main plot improvement method proposed for increasing
    application efficiency is land levelling, followed by proper irrigation recipes.
    The main supporting activity was monitoring of water use through measurement.
    The average increase in application efficiency was 6.38% and water saving was
    8.22%, when improvement actions were taken in the irrigated lands (Pérez-Nieto
    and Hernández-Saucedo, 2017; Castillo González et al., 2017). Faba beans have
    high nutritional value and are very popular in the diet of Egyptians. As a result
    of the limited cultivated area in Egypt and expansion in sugar beet cultivation
    to reduce the sugar production–consumption gap in Egypt, the cultivated area of
    faba bean was highly reduced. The results of the field study indicated that surface
    irrigation for faba bean resulted in very low water productivity (< 0.50 kg m−3).
    The productivity under drip irrigation was better, but less than 1.0 kg m−3. Changing
    the cultivation method to raised beds increased productivity and saved irrigation
    water, which could be used to irrigate new areas, but water productivity was still
    lower than 1.0 kg m−3. The highest water productivity can be attained with cultivation
    of faba bean on raised beds and intercropping it with other crops, where its water
    productivity increased to be higher than 1.0 kg m−3, having the potential to reach
    6.07 kg m−3 in Upper Egypt. Thus, it can be concluded that raised bed cultivation
    and intercropping faba bean systems can highly enhance faba bean water productivity
    and combat water scarcity (Zohry & Ouda, 2017). All over surface-irrigated regions
    in the world, adverse soil physical characteristics have been and continue to
    be inhibiting irrigation modernization and improvement programmes. This problem
    is specific to the shrinking and swelling of clay soils, which are difficult to
    handle either when too wet or too dry. Experiencing the non-maintainability of
    conventional lined canals over soft and shrinking–swelling clay soils over a 60
    000 ha irrigation area in the Waduk Kedung Ombo (WKO) irrigation systems in central
    Java, Indonesia, the option of prefabricated canal lining was taken up. This option
    has satisfactorily and permanently addressed the problem of canal disruption (Priandini
    & Maddi, 2017). A ‘small tank cascade system’ of water resource management is
    common in Sri Lanka, where it contributes nearly 195 000 million t of rice to
    national production (20% of national production). The natural drainage system
    in a watershed is blocked by earth bunds in suitable locations to store water,
    forming a series of tanks along the drainage system, distributed within a microcatchment
    of the dry zone. Such series are called village tank cascade systems. Traditionally,
    in the dry zone of Sri Lanka there is at least one tank in each village. The village
    community makes multiple uses of the tank water, such as for drinking, domestic
    uses, bathing, inland fishery and for cattle. Increased water storage also contributes
    towards maintaining the groundwater table (Perera, Jayatillake, & Wijayaratna,
    2017). In the next 30 years, the world''s population will increase to about 9.2
    billion, affecting water quality and also water availability, causing fierce competition
    for water among the different sectors. In the face of an increasing shortage of
    fresh water; partly due to climate change and partly to anthropogenic pressure,
    attention has focused on the possibility of utilizing waste water, mainly for
    agriculture. During the last century, agricultural water use increased 5 times
    and industrial water use 28 times. Of the pollution load from industry, about
    60–80% can be treated and the remainder will drain into the rivers without any
    treatment. Despite various attempts to manage irrigation water (the largest consumer
    of water) scientifically, the ground truth is that there is a long way to go before
    agricultural water is actually managed scientifically to minimize its losses,
    overuse and misuse. Incidentally, agriculture is also a noteworthy water-polluting
    activity because of competition to increase production by applying more fertilizer,
    more agro-chemicals and sometimes more water. It is also to be noted that the
    volume of waste water has also been increasing in leaps and bounds. Some waste
    waters are treatable to improve their quality for use in agriculture (mainly irrigation).
    Waste water treatment effect has been studied using bagasse fly ash layers of
    different thicknesses as filters. The efficiency of colour remover was 94% at
    effluent flow rates of 0.45 m3 day−1, with bagasse fly ash layer thickness of
    7 cm. The study, however, was restricted to only removal of colour of the waste
    water and did not show if other important parameters (BOD. COD, DO and salts including
    heavy metals) could be controlled through the use of bagasse fly ash in combination
    with a sand filter (Pongnam & Plermkamon, 2017). Currently in Mexico, only about
    half of waste water is treated for reuse. In an effort to increase the amount
    of treated waste water, it is important to enhance the knowledge of integrated
    management for using waste water in agriculture. To fulfil this objective, the
    Mexican Institute of Water Technology has published a book on waste water reuse
    in agriculture. This publication will be helpful for enhancing the technical capacities
    of the personnel responsible for water treatment and reuse (Cisneros Estrada,
    Saucedo, & García Rojas, 2017). Irrigation development and modernization in all
    countries have paid attention more to the constructional aspect rather than management
    for handling water. There has also been a lack of participation of stakeholders
    in irrigation system development. The goal should be not only to modernize irrigation
    systems but also development of institutions and human capital and effective collaboration
    among the stakeholder (community) (Sutiarso, Supadmo Arif, & Murtiningrum, 2017).
    Sub-Question 61.2. Using Ict, Remote Sensing, Control Systems and Modelling for
    Improved Performance of Irrigation Systems Water is critical for sustainable development,
    including environmental integrity and the alleviation of poverty and hunger, and
    is indispensable for human health and well-being. Imbalances between availability
    and demand, the degradation of groundwater and surface water quality, inter-sector
    competition, inter-region and international disputes, all centre on the question
    of how to cope with scarce water resources. Efficient water management has been
    identified as one of the priorities to ensure food security in many areas of the
    world. On the other hand, smart technologies are nowadays spreading into all sectors
    of human activity. Remote sensing, modelling, sensors, remote control systems,
    application of information and communication technology (ICT) are potential tools
    to improve the efficient use of water to achieve improved performance of irrigation
    systems,including geospatial and drones, etc., to improve management of soil,
    water and crops, and to predict and mitigate the impacts of extreme weather conditions
    of droughts and floods. By considering the importance of improving the performance
    of irrigation systems, the ICID, during the 23rd Congress, formulated Question
    61.2: ‘Using ICT, Remote Sensing, Control Systems and Modelling for Improved Performance
    of Irrigation Systems’ and invited papers for presentation. General overview of
    the papers on remote sensing Planning of water resource use for irrigation is
    often difficult due to insufficient and untrustworthy recorded data. Inaccuracies
    in data can only be identified by comparing their values with estimations from
    alternative methods, e.g. remote sensing. In a study, water supply was estimated
    based on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and correlations built
    upon time series of official statistical data. Correlation between NDVI and the
    coefficient of irrigation water productivity (CIWP) allows estimation of irrigation
    efficiency, while the correlation between CIWP and total water supply enables
    further assessment of the latter. Correlations remain relevant with constant irrigation
    practices on arid lands where effective agriculture needs continuous irrigation.
    In the study, the NDVI index was used as the main spectral index for both irrigation
    area and water supply assessment (Danylenko, Mykhailov, Liutnitski, & Bohaienko,
    2017). A study focused on identification of agricultural drought characteristics
    and elaborated a monitoring method which could result in appropriate early warning
    of droughts. Based on remote sensing (RS) technology, an Agricultural Drought
    Monitoring and Yield Loss Forecasting Method can be used to identify possible
    intervention areas. With help of the method, the effect of drought on crops can
    be detected 4–6 weeks earlier than before and delineated more accurately, and
    its impact on agriculture can be diagnosed far in advance of harvest, which is
    the most vital need for global food security and trade. This information can reduce
    impacts if delivered to decision makers in a timely and appropriate format and
    if mitigation measures and preparedness plans are in place. Understanding the
    underlying causes of vulnerability is also an essential component of drought management
    because the ultimate goal is to reduce risk for a particular location and for
    a specific group of people or agricultural or economic sector (Nagy, Tamás, &
    János, 2017). Researchers believe that adoption of RS technology gives better
    estimates of irrigated area, salinized area and efficiency of the irrigation system.
    Also, adoption of this technology becomes essential for planning, design and operation
    of an irrigation system when the recorded data of ground truth are limited or
    unreliable (Vlasova, Shevchenko, Shatkovska, & Ryabtsev, 2017). Two remotely sensed
    vegetation indices, namely enhanced vegetation index (EVI) and NDVI, together
    with land surface temperature (LST) onboard a moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer
    (MODIS) satellite, were used as indicators of vegetation health and vigour. Time
    series EVI and NDVI were analysed from 2000 to 2016 for the study area. Both EVI
    and NDVI are available in 250 m resolution, 23 data sets per year. LST are available
    in 1 km resolution every 8 days or 46 data sets per year. LST were resampled to
    250 m and aggregated to 23 data sets per year. Ten digital elevation models (DEMs)
    for the study area were acquired from an advanced space-borne thermal emission
    and reflection radiometer-global digital elevation model (ASTER GDEM) in 30 m
    resolution. An interview was conducted with the farmers in the irrigation district.
    Finally, it was concluded that EVI exhibited high sensitivity to detecting crop
    conditions, both healthy and stressful, in response to water availability (Herdianto,
    2017). Reliable estimation of crop coefficients is a prerequisite for scientific
    allocation and application of water to the cropland. Working on this notion, researchers
    emphasize that vegetation indices estimated from multispectral images play an
    important role in Kc estimation and consequently, the crops’ irrigation requirement.
    The object-based image analysis (OBIA) classification algorithm allowed differentiation
    of crop and soil characteristics, giving more accurate values of vegetation indices
    and crop monitoring. A linear model was used to estimate Kc as a function of NDVI.
    The r2 = 0.97 was higher than those reported when using satellite images due to
    the fact that unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images have higher spatial resolution
    and better separation between crop, crop shadow, soil shadow and bare soil. Using
    Kc–NDVI models, maps can be generated showing the spatial variation of Kc (De
    Jesús Marcial-Pablo et al., 2017). A study on a 20-ha maize farm in Karaj, Iran,
    combined two indices of accumulated growth degree days (AGDD) and NDVI for modelling
    of maize phenology and determination of the onset of phenological stages. Considering
    the severe noise and 7 days interval in available multi-temporal images, it was
    necessary to use smoother methods. For this purpose and to achieve high-quality
    time series of NDVI, the real-time smoothing method of the weighted least squares
    (WLS) model was applied. The results of the combined model were compared by two
    frequently used methods based on AGDD and sowing-based models. The root mean square
    error (RMSE) using the combined model was the least for all the phenological stages
    (Ghahreman, Ghamghami, Irannejad, & Ghorbani, 2017). General overview of the papers
    on knowledge management Sutiarso et al. (2017) believe that there are five pillars
    of irrigation modernization in Indonesia: (i) water availability; (ii) irrigation
    infrastructure; (iii) irrigation management; (iv) institutional irrigation management;
    (v) human resource (knowledge management base). They have, however, chosen to
    dwell upon the knowledge management aspect. A case study paper based in Madhya
    Pradesh, India, indicates that the development of a web-based management information
    system (MIS) was a central tool in the process of a significant increase in irrigated
    area. The paper discusses the genesis and development of this tool under the World
    Bank-funded Madhya Pradesh Water Sector Restructuring Project (MPWSRP) and the
    measures adopted to facilitate its development and uptake by the department. The
    paper concludes that the availability of timely, accurate and transparent data
    is fundamental to the modern management of irrigation and drainage schemes (Burton
    & Stoutjesdijk, 2017). A paper based on a study on ‘Real-Time Feedback Control
    System for Improving Agricultural Water-Use Efficiency of Basin Irrigation’ discussed
    the real-time feedback control system of surface irrigation, including a real-time
    irrigation information acquisition and transmission module and a central controller.
    The proposed system has been applied in some irrigation districts and showed effective
    improvement of water-use efficiency (Wu, Xu, Bai, Li, & Li, 2017). The paper on
    intelligent measurement and monitoring of irrigation amount in well- irrigated
    areas presents real-time monitoring and control technology for irrigation wells,
    which consist of an ultrasonic flow meter, communication module and control terminals.
    The study was done in North China and the authors claim that individual farmers
    can use the technology through use of their prepaid smart cards. Management platforms
    at different levels, such as city, county, water station and village, can be set
    up to monitor irrigation water amount and distribution (Jing, Chongbao, & Hong,
    2017). Use of web-based information in planning, designing and monitoring of irrigation
    systems is termed ‘cloud computing’, essentially a DSS with a much broader scope.
    In order to solve the problem of inefficient use of water and fertilizer, a paper
    proposed an intelligent cloud irrigation system to manage the two resources in
    protected agriculture. The authors claim that the system is of great importance
    in guiding protected agricultural facilities to achieve high yield, high quality,
    ecology and safety in production. It improved water use efficiency by 25–40%,
    fertilizer use efficiency by 15–35%, shortened labour time and decreased the labour
    force sharply (Qinghong, Xinlan, Shuai, Hejing, & Qunchang, 2017). Information
    and communication technologies (ICTs) are an indispensable tool for improving
    the performance of irrigation systems. Their implementation requires an approach
    adapted to the needs of the actors, ensuring their optimal appropriation for the
    achievement of lasting results. The innovative methodology used to integrate ICTs
    into the PARIIS-SIIP program from the formulation phase, and the results obtained
    at this stage of development as well as recommendations for the successful implementation
    of the program were presented (Figuères, Onimus, & Ouédraogo, 2017). The researchers
    of a greenhouse experimental study on tomato presented a DSS that could be used
    to help greenhouse growers improve their current fertigation practice (Martinez-Ruiz,
    López-Cruz, Ruiz-García, Pineda-Pineda, & Prado-Hernandez, 2017). A paper from
    Indonesia mentions that irrigation management for its modernization requires effectiveness
    and efficiency in the operation of the irrigation network. Monitoring and remote
    control technology used in this research is the application of reporting of a
    website-based operation, measurement of volumetric discharge, and an electromechanically
    controlled water gate. Problems encountered in implementation were also discussed
    (Hidayah, Prihantoko, & Hutadjulu, 2017). A physical model along with a software
    program was used to evaluate the uniformity coefficient of centre pivot sprinkler
    irrigation systems in Iraq. The objective was to examine the improvement of the
    uniformity coefficient by changing the water supply from the pivot point to the
    middle of the main pipeline. Based on the result of this study, the author concluded
    that the software program can be used as a tool to predict the behaviour of the
    sprinkler system under different layouts and different operating pressures (Al-Katb,
    2017). In a study in China, the finite-volume approach and a fully coupled model
    for a canal–field system was developed to simulate unsteady flow simulation for
    a canal–field system in an irrigation district. Using the approach and the model,
    the water distribution and gate control in the experiment area was optimized.
    The optimized solution revealed that water consumption could be reduced by about
    21% compared to the present situation (Shaohui et al., 2017b). Three PI tuning
    methods for downstream water level control were used and three methods for tuning
    and designing PI controllers for downstream control were evaluated. The evaluation
    criteria were: effectiveness of tuning; and potential for practical application
    on an actual canal in the field. The analysis results of the methods and recommendations
    are presented. The paper examines three methods for tuning and designing PI controllers
    for downstream control: iterative, Ziegler Nichols and bump tuning. The methods
    are evaluated using three criteria: how easy each method is to understand and
    utilize; effectiveness of tuning; and potential for practical application on an
    actual canal in the field. The analysis results of the methods and recommendations
    are presented in the paper (Stringam, Wahlin, & Wahl, 2017). In a paper from Iran,
    the hydraulic behaviour of the canal and operational scenarios are simulated using
    the ICSS (irrigation canal system simulation) hydrodynamic model. The canal performance
    was evaluated using adequacy, efficiency and equity indices. The results show
    that application of managerial operations has improved the adequacy and efficiency
    indices by about 5–10% for all intakes, and the equity index has improved by 4%
    for the whole canal (Ostovari, Monem, & Hashemi Shahedani, 2017). A mathematical
    model study was carried out in southern Finland on groundwater table behaviour
    in a subsurface drained land using the three-dimensional (3-D) FLUSH model. Based
    on the study, the authors conclude that the effect of drain spacing had a more
    visible effect on groundwater table depth than on water balance components (Warsta
    et al., 2017). In addition to the above, there were two papers which were not
    directly linked to the theme of Question 61, but were indirectly linked to some
    of the issues related to the Question. Briefly, these papers are: folded plate
    technology. This paper from India on folded plate earth-retaining and bank-stabilizing
    structures provided useful and valuable information on structural/ constructional
    aspects of river training and management works (Dinkar & Panday, 2017); ecological
    water diversion. This paper from China analyses RS images to evaluate the practice
    of ecological emergency water diversion to Nansi Lake in China. The paper provides
    useful information of RS utilization for ecological purposes (Qu, Wang, Li, Hu,
    & Zhao, 2017). Sub-Question 61.3. Adaptability and Affordability of New Technologies
    Under Different Socio-Economic Scenarios New technologies in irrigation are continually
    being developed. Methods of applying irrigation water, determining crop water
    requirements, using low-quality water, providing drainage, improving water storage
    and delivery systems, forecasting droughts and floods and improving the knowledge
    of those involved in the storage, delivery and application of irrigation water
    are some of the areas where new technology is helping to improve the production
    of food throughout the world. Almost 25% of the world''s countries suffer from
    different levels of water stress. Access to newly generated technology in agriculture
    should be a human right more than an option for farmers, especially those with
    fewer economic assets. Since agriculture is the sector that uses the most water
    (around 69% worldwide), special emphasis is needed to increase irrigation water
    use efficiency which in some countries is very low (including conveyance, storage
    and application). The electromechanical efficiencies of pumping equipment should
    be taken into account when computing global efficiencies. The development of new
    irrigation-related technologies does not automatically result in better irrigation
    practices and thus more food production. New technologies must be put into use
    before they can be of value. Putting a new technology into use requires that it
    be adaptable, economically beneficial and acceptable to those who will use it.
    This may be a very difficult task when implementing some new technologies, and
    thus, testing and experiments are needed. Pilot demonstrations and extensions
    with continuous improvement for their adaptability and affordability under different
    natural and socio-economic scenarios are necessary. For example, something that
    may work very well in a small laboratory environment may not be feasible in the
    natural environment of an agricultural field. Also, something that works very
    well in the laboratory may not be accepted by those who would use it in the field
    because it is cumbersome or unfamiliar to them. The adaptability of new technology
    to various climatic, environmental and socio-economic conditions is a significant
    factor in determining its validity. A new concept that provides a significant
    efficiency improvement in one geographical area or socio-economic setting may
    not be useful at all in another. For example, the computerization of a pivot sprinkler
    system will have little or no value in a part of the world where the farming takes
    place on hillside terraces or where farmers cannot afford computers or sprinkler
    systems. A modern efficient electric irrigation pump is of no value if there is
    no electricity available to drive the pump. Newly generated technology encompasses
    a process of transfer or training for users independent of their socio-economic
    level. Experience has shown that at the field level it is difficult to convince
    farmers to adopt any technology if it does not imply an economic return in the
    short run. Moreover, if the new technology requires a financial investment, farmers
    will think twice about its adoption, especially those farmers with low economic
    capacity, unless a special subsidy is provided to assist them. In this framework,
    the development of technology should take into account farmers’ needs from the
    social point of view and from the state of the natural resource (water) and the
    ecological points of view. The former should yield technology of easy application
    that is understandable and inexpensive and the latter should yield technology
    that does more with less water and has a small energy footprint. Within irrigation
    districts or water user organizations, the aim of new technologies should imply
    an increment in operational efficiency and in the way data are gathered to plan
    and operate better or improved irrigation systems. New technologies at the irrigation
    district or water user organization level could also include improved policies,
    processes and administration. Irrigation technology does not necessarily imply
    piping or canal lining, or high-tech or complicated equipment, or expensive ways
    of pumping or distributing water within fields. Rather, it should imply better
    water management through better practices. New technology for irrigation districts
    or water user organizations must also be applicable and affordable for varying
    conditions. It should be understood that there are different levels of technology
    needs and adoption according to the socio-economic level of farmers and water
    user organizations. One big mistake that governments have made is to try to increase
    the level of water efficiency of farmers and water user organizations from a very
    inefficient platform to the highest level of water use efficiency while neglecting
    the cultural, social and economic situation. The goal of increasing water use
    efficiency should proceed in a succession of steps towards achieving the desired
    level over time. Let us say that there are three categories of farmers in terms
    of water use efficiency: A, B and C, with A being the most efficient and C being
    the least. It is a mistake to try to move farmer C to level A in the short run.
    It will be more affordable and successful to move farmer C to level B and farmer
    B to level A. This procedure may cost time and money but will yield results that
    are more promising. Trying to move farmer C directly to level A will likely result
    in the farmer giving up on any improvements because they are beyond his or her
    physical, mental or economic capabilities to implement them. The situation dictates
    the level of technology that is needed. The land tenure and/or the land size of
    landowners (or land operators) are also important factors for the adaptation of
    new irrigation technologies, particularly in developing countries. For example,
    in China, it is difficult for traditional small household farmers to use drip
    irrigation because, to them, drip irrigation is not affordable and is complicated
    in management. However, in recent years many farmers have been transferring their
    lands by contracts to large-scale centralized land operators. As a result, drip
    irrigation and automatic control irrigation systems have developed quickly, as
    land operators can afford, manage and get benefit from the new irrigation technologies
    applied. It may be true that the small land scale and weak economic strength of
    farmers are major constraints for adaptation of new irrigation technologies in
    many developing countries, such as drip and sprinkler irrigation. However, it
    was also found that there is a simple, low-pressure drip irrigation technology
    (with elevated water tanks near the field to provide the low pressure needed)
    for small-scale farmers in India that reportedly worked well for small field plots.
    This, once again, shows the importance of ‘adaptability and affordability’ of
    new irrigation technologies. Introducing technology that is beyond the capabilities
    of the water users to implement will result in disaster. If farmers or water user
    organizations become frustrated trying to implement new technologies they will
    probable revert to the old methods they had been using and which they are comfortable
    with. This will often result in the abandonment of infrastructure or ideas that
    could eventually be used for more efficient use of water for agriculture. Farmers
    and water user organizations should participate in the decision-making process
    when any new technology is to be introduced. Here is where transfer of technology
    and training play a main role. The commitment of water user organizations participating
    in governmental programmes needs to include the training of their personnel and
    farmers to assure the success of the improvement plan. General overview of the
    papers The solar disinfection (SODIS) process uses the intense ultraviolet radiation
    from sunlight shining through a non-opaque container filled with non-potable water
    (grey water) to kill undesirable pathogens, rendering the water safe to drink.
    This method was used for irrigation of tomato seedlings and not for obtaining
    potable water. The authors describe a research project in this area in Brazil.
    However, no information on the adaptive potential or the affordability of the
    process is given (Aleman, Silva, & De Souza Pereira, 2017). Researchers in Brazil
    presented a greenhouse experiment for the determination of the weekly crop coefficient
    of tomato seedlings. The authors contend that often in practice, production systems
    do not operate under efficient management, not because of a lack of technology
    or capital, but because decisions are improvised, random, careless or subjective
    (Aleman & Bastos, 2017). Attributing the earlier misuse of irrigation systems
    in Ukraine as the reason for decline of the system, the authors of a paper have
    called for immediate action for their technical modernization, and of effective
    technical solutions as a prerequisite for sustainable development of irrigated
    farming. Though the Congress was a good place to discuss the adaptability and
    affordability of new technologies the authors did not pursue this (Romashchenko
    & Dekhtiar, 2017). A paper from China has presented some very good concepts on
    balancing needs, population growth, social knowledge, etc. Although the technology
    presented in the paper may not be new, its application is still valid. Moreover,
    various traditional forms of irrigation should be systematically researched not
    only for their engineering value, but also their sociological and ecological value
    (Yunpeng, Xuming, Ruoxi, Jun, & Jiangang, 2017). There has been a proposal to
    initiate a new groundwater management policy in Mexico. A paper in this regard
    discusses the need to allow users to have more of a voice in regulating groundwater
    extraction. Such a move would enhance the effectiveness of the new management
    policy (Casillas, González, Espinosa, González Bernal, & Bernabe, 2017). The authors
    of a paper discuss a study of two sample national irrigation systems that face
    water shortages and destructive floods during the dry and wet cropping seasons,
    respectively. The paper reflects on some of the shortcomings of earlier attempts
    to introduce new technology and discusses ways to make sure future new technology
    is adaptable and affordable. They feel that the basic approach to identification
    of appropriate irrigation modernization options includes: (i) critical analysis
    of the logical consistency of the design of the physical structure, system operation
    and water supply; (ii) assessment of the physical capacity of the irrigation structures
    to perform their functions; (iii) due consideration of social acceptability of
    selected irrigation technology and water users’ vision of the future modernized
    irrigation system; (iv) integration of effective local solutions to evident design
    shortcomings into the modernization plan (Delos Reyes & Schultz, 2017). The authors
    of a paper from Mexico feel that there are technologies available to overcome
    the adverse consequences of weather extremes and resource degradation but few
    will be able to pay for it. However, land improvement through drainage is considered
    an economic solution to the salinity problems in Mexico (Arias et al., 2017).
    The authors of a paper from Indonesia on the competitiveness of modular canal
    lining discuss replacing damaged canal linings with precast concrete sections
    and compare that with stone masonry linings. The authors indicate that users generally
    will easily accept and apply this technology because of the advantages in terms
    of strength, lifespan and maintenance costs. However, users have perceptions that
    stone masonry lining is better in terms of ease of construction, construction
    time and cost of construction (Sofiyuddin, Uzae, & Mulyadi, 2017). There are several
    papers presented under Sub-question 61.3 which are either not related or very
    remotely related to the theme of the Sub-question. One such paper on rainfall
    distribution and vegetation greenness from Natal, South Africa, claims that water
    storage for the present and future remains critical for economic and social development
    in South Africa. A paper from Taiwan deals with monitoring the safety of a dam
    structure. A paper from Mexico discusses the maintenance of irrigation infrastructure
    by removing sediment from the water conveyance network. A paper from Pakistan
    discusses groundwater conditions and its future, from the standpoint of its importance
    in agriculture. A paper, very distantly connected with irrigated agriculture,
    evaluates the effects and type of tourism in the Hsinchu City area using the ‘travel
    cost method’ of multi-criteria decision-making. A paper, better related to the
    theme (or water resources and irrigation) from Mexico, discusses the value and
    opportunities of using solar power to operate pumps for agricultural water. A
    paper proposes two tools for assessing the need for, and prioritizing the work
    to upgrade, small storage tanks in Sri Lanka. The author of a paper on a physical
    model study in Mexico discusses using a physical model to determine the flow through
    a tunnel. The data were then used to make recommendations for changes to the tunnel
    to improve the flow. The model work and results are commendable but cannot be
    clubbed together with other work, as this has been the only paper of its kind
    (Maponya & Mpandeli, 2017; Huang et al., 2017; Ramón & Nazario, 2017; Hassan et
    al., 2017; Chiueh and Liu, 2017; Robles Linares Gándara, 2017; Perera et al.,
    2017; Maldonado, 2017). Summary Question 61 had three Sub-questions, namely 61.1,
    61.2 and 61.3. The themes of the Sub-questions and the number of papers received
    under them are given below: Sub-question 61.1. Adopting precision irrigation and
    improving surface irrigation to combat water scarcity (25 papers); Sub-question
    61.2. Using ICT, remote sensing, control systems and modelling for improved performance
    of irrigation systems (22 papers); Sub-question 61.3. Adaptability and affordability
    of new technologies under different socio-economic scenarios (17 papers). In all
    the Sub-questions, there were a few papers that were not directly linked to the
    Sub-question theme. However, irrigation is a very broad subject and encompasses
    the entities of water, land and human resources. So linkages do exist, though
    they may not be clear. In this section, therefore, those weakly or indirectly
    linked papers are also included. Freshwater scarcity is of global concern and
    feared to be aggravated in the future. As expected, therefore, a number of researchers
    have addressed this issue. As water resources cannot be created in addition to
    what nature has provided, several authors have highlighted the efficient use of
    water resources to minimize undesirable and avoidable losses of water: in its
    storage, conveyance, application and use. Loss or wasted irrigation water is manifested
    in soil salinization, waterlogging, unworkable soil conditions, particularly in
    shrinking and swelling clay soils. Hence a set of papers across countries has
    addressed this issue. The water quality aspect has not escaped the researchers’
    attention. This is an important aspect and a management issue, as while on the
    one hand, fresh water cannot be created, poor-quality water always increases in
    quantity and deteriorates in quality due to anthropogenic activities of the ever-growing
    population. Since surface irrigation by the gravity flow of water over cropped
    land is the most common the world over, attention to improving surface irrigation
    efficiency is naturally expected. Also, such attention has been greater in water-scarce
    arid and semi-arid countries and regions. There are papers on the correct estimation
    of crop water requirements based on which type of irrigation water is applied
    in the field. Web information-based estimation (alternatively known as ‘cloud
    computing’), an advanced method of estimating real-time-based crop water requirements,
    has been used. A point of interest is that the topics of research and application
    that earlier used to be in the domain of research and educational institutions,
    have now also spread to executive departments. The case is similar with model
    studies, including physical and mathematical models. Real-time monitoring of irrigation
    and appropriate follow-up action have been applied in some irrigation districts
    and have shown effective improvement of water use efficiency. Similarly, intelligent
    measurement and monitoring of irrigation amounts in well-irrigated areas involve
    real-time monitoring and application of control technology for irrigation wells,
    which consist of an ultrasonic flow meter, communication module and control terminals.
    Obviously, such systems and methodologies improve irrigation performance. Further,
    even individual farmers can use the technology by using prepaid smart cards. Management
    platforms at different levels, such as city, county, water station and village,
    can be set up to monitor irrigation water amounts and distribution. Thus, the
    64 papers in Question 61 appear to have addressed all the relevant issues related
    to irrigated agriculture and some of the papers have even gone beyond them. Acknowledgments

  explanation: Closed-loop control is a self-regulating system that continuously monitors
    and adapts its output based on feedback from the system's environment. In the
    case of autonomous irrigation systems, closed-loop control can help to ensure
    that the system is watering the crops at the optimal time and with the optimal
    amount of water. This can lead to increased crop yields and reduced water usage.

    Abstract:\nThe deployment of appropriate technologies to enhance \nmodern agricultural\
    \ practices and improve crop yields \nis imperative for sustainability. This paper\
    \ presents the \ndevelopment of a standalone automated irrigation sys-\ntem. The\
    \ system design features good automation and \ncontrol, which was achieved using\
    \ an array of electronic \ntiming system, soil feedback sensor and wireless commu-\n\
    nication system. Autonomous irrigation events are based \non the states of the\
    \ timing system, the soil feedback sys-\ntem and the wireless communication system.\
    \ The control \nand automation of these systems was done using an AVR \nmicrocontroller,\
    \ which was programmed to trigger intelli-\ngent and independent farm irrigation\
    \ operation through \na water pump attached to the system. The system also \n\
    operates remotely via SMS command from mobile device \nand sends operational status\
    \ feedback via SMS to pre-\nprogrammed mobile user(s). It also sends soil moisture\
    \ \ncondition to a remote user upon query. The system pack-\nage was produced\
    \ using additive manufacturing tech-\nnique. The power supply system was implemented\
    \ using \nsolar power system in order to achieve a standalone, \nautonomous and\
    \ reliable power supply necessary for an \nindependent operation. The performance\
    \ evaluation of \nthe developed system show impressive response time, \ngood reliability\
    \ and excellent stability. Furthermore, the \nnumerical experiment conducted using\
    \ the Response \nSurface Methodology (RSM) produced a mathematical \nmodel for\
    \ the optimization of the irrigation process for \noptimum performance and cost\
    \ effectiveness. \nKeywords: \nAdditive \nmanufacturing, \nAutomation, \nIrrigation,\
    \ Intelligent system, Microcontroller\n1. Introduction\nThe development of appropriate\
    \ technologies in \nmodern agricultural practices have not only improved \ncrop\
    \ yields but have also increased the ease with which \nfarming practices are being\
    \ done especially with the \nadvent of robotic tools. With the increasing awareness\
    \ \nand advocacy for round – the – year farming, and the \nneed to meet up with\
    \ the challenge of global food de-\nmand, deploying appropriate technologies to\
    \ increase \nproductivity and reduce the burden often associated \nwith farm practices\
    \ has become inevitable. Since the \nrole of agriculture in the economic development\
    \ of any \nnation cannot be overemphasized, there is need boost \nagricultural\
    \ productivity with the use of intelligent sys-\ntems for increased food production\
    \ and revenue gener-\nation [1–2]. One of such areas in agricultural practices\
    \ \nthat has posed much burden, wasted useful times and \nresources is farm irrigation.\
    \ Irrigation is the artificial \napplication of water to the land or soil which\
    \ assist in \nthe growing of agricultural crops, maintenance of land-\nscapes,\
    \ and revegetation of soils in dry areas as well \nas during periods of inadequate\
    \ rainfall [3–5]. Mainly, \nthere are two types of irrigation systems namely;\
    \ sprin-\nkler [6–7] and drip irrigation system [8–9]. The use of \nthe sprinkler\
    \ irrigation system involves the spraying \nof water into the air with the aid\
    \ of a pumping system \nand sprinkler, which falls on the crops in form of small\
    \ \ndrops of water like the rain. It finds suitable applica-\ntion in farm rows\
    \ or fields either uniform or undulating \n[10]. On the other hand, the drip irrigation\
    \ involves the \npassage of water directly to the root of plants from or \nbelow\
    \ the soil surface using pipes or tubes. This form \nof irrigation is highly effective\
    \ and conservative and \nmost suitable in areas with acute shortage of water \n\
    supply [11]. With regards to the challenges posed by \nconventional irrigation\
    \ practices, the use of intelligent \nsystems for irrigation are better appreciated\
    \ particu-\nlarly with large-scale farming. Conventional methods \nof irrigation\
    \ are labour intensive, time-consuming, \nrelatively ineffective due to poor water\
    \ distribution \nand lack of monitoring as well as smart control mech-\nanisms\
    \ [12–13]. Its over-reliance on human control \nmakes it not suitable for large-scale\
    \ farming [14–16]. \nAutomatic irrigation systems on the contrary are nei-\nther\
    \ laborious nor time-consuming and can help meet \nthe ever increasing demand\
    \ for food production all the \nyear round [17–18]. In addition, the process is\
    \ cost ef-\nfective in the long run as the initial capital invested will \nbe\
    \ offset via large scale farming to meet the increasing \ndemand for food production\
    \ [19–20]. The burden the \nautomated irrigation system seeks to resolve is the\
    \ abil-\nity to intelligently and independently irrigate the farm \nenvironment.\
    \ As such, farmers can commit the time \nhitherto wasted on prolonged and laborious\
    \ manual \nirrigation to other productive tasks while the system \nindependently\
    \ executes the irrigation process. Accord-\ning to Ganturi [21] and Curtis [22],\
    \ the requirements \nfor a smart irrigation system includes the effective \napplication\
    \ and distribution of water as well as good \ncontrol and monitoring of the process\
    \ of irrigation with \nappropriate feedback mechanisms. Karim et al. [23] \nJournal\

    \ automated irrigation system \ninclude the ability to take intelligent decisions\
    \ on its \nstate, based on operational and soil conditions. Also, \nthe solar\
    \ power provision will enable it sustain a con-\ntinuous operation at all times\
    \ and to achieve high \nreliability in its operations. The need for irrigation\
    \ \ntend to increase with increase in solar energy usually \naccompanied by soil\
    \ moisture loss. Hence, the solar \nenergy can be trapped for powering the autonomous\
    \ \nsystem. \n2.1. System Architecture\nThe architecture of the developed system\
    \ is pre-\nsented in Figure 1.\nFig. 1. Architecture of the automated irrigation\
    \ system\n2.2. Automation and Control\nGenerally, irrigation exercise is usually\
    \ carried \nout in the morning or evening hours for the sake of \nthe health of\
    \ farm crops. The pre-programmed time \nfor irrigation was done and stored on\
    \ the micro con-\ntroller. Hence, the microcontroller routinely checks \nfor this\
    \ time with respect to the environmental con-\nditions. A DS1307 timing system\
    \ also known as the \nreal time clock was incorporated to give an accurate \n\
    track of the date and time of the irrigation activities \n(Figure 2).\nFig. 2.\
    \ DS1307 timing system\nAccording to the programming of the microcon-\ntroller,\
    \ there will be need for irrigation only if the \nsoil moisture goes below 25%\
    \ and such irrigation \noperation is halted if the farm is irrigated up to 50%.\
    \ \nTherefore, the microcontroller keeps its check for the \nenvironmental conditions\
    \ in respect of the pre-set \ntime most especially when the humidity drops below\
    \ \ndeveloped a sensor-based M2M agriculture monitor-\ning systems for developing\
    \ countries citing high level \nof automation and control as one of the challenges\
    \ to \nbe addressed. Also, Alagupandi et al. [24] developed \na smart irrigation\
    \ system for outdoor environment us-\ning TinyOS while Gutierrez [25] developed\
    \ an automat-\ned irrigation system using a wireless sensor network \nand GPRS\
    \ module. These works provided a convenient \nplatform for automation, control\
    \ and tracking of irri-\ngation activities. Mrinmayi et al. [26] also developed\
    \ \na smart irrigation system using internet of things while \nRoy and Ansari\
    \ [27], developed autonomous irrigation \nsystems that uses every day climate\
    \ criterion for irriga-\ntion purpose. This helps in saving considerable amount\
    \ \nof water for irrigation via the use of Programmable \nLogic Controller (PLC).\
    \ The issue of water loss due to \nprecipitation has been identified as one of\
    \ the major \nchallenges during the irrigation process. In a bid to \naddress\
    \ this challenge, Kumar et al. [28] developed an \nautomatic irrigation system\
    \ that uses field sensing and \nforecasting in an attempt to control irrigation\
    \ based on \nsoil moisture for the sustainable irrigation of crops. For \neffective\
    \ distribution and control of water irrigation ac-\ntivities, Bai and Liang [29]\
    \ as well as Li-Fang [30] de-\nveloped an optimal model for water conservation.\
    \ The \nparameters that are essential in order to facilitate good \nmonitoring\
    \ and control are; temperature, air humidity \nand soil moisture [30–35]. The\
    \ design objectives of the \ndeveloped automated irrigation system are to achieve\
    \ \noperational intelligence, automation and independ-\nence thereby easing the\
    \ stress often associated with \nconventional irrigation practices. The novelties\
    \ of this \nwork lies in the fact that the ease of operation of the \ndeveloped\
    \ automated system comes with its multiple \nmodes of operation, which affords\
    \ the user convenient \nchoices of operation. The modes include the full auto-\n\
    mation mode whereby the system operates autono-\nmously using the states of the\
    \ timing system and the \nsoil feedback sensor to take intelligent decisions on\
    \ \nappropriate time and extent of irrigation activities to \nbe implemented.\
    \ In addition, a user could send a com-\nmand remotely via mobile phone to the\
    \ field system to \nstart or stop irrigation. Furthermore, users have the \nprivilege\
    \ of querying the system remotely in order to \nget feedback on the real time\
    \ soil conditions. Upon re-\nceiving such command via the Short Message Service\
    \ \n(SMS), the system queries the soil feedback sensor and \nsends the soil moisture\
    \ readings to the authorized us-\ner(s). The system can also be made to operate\
    \ in the \nmanual mode relying on human effort or semi auton-\nomously relying\
    \ on human control during certain pe-\nriods such as the start up or shut down\
    \ based on the \nenvironment and nature of irrigation activities to be \ncarried\
    \ out. The aforementioned peculiarities of the \ndeveloped automated irrigation\
    \ system have not been \nsufficiently reported by the existing literature.\n2.\
    \ Materials and Method\nThe materials employed in the implementation of \nthis\
    \ system are real time clock module, YL – 69 sen-\nsor, SIM800L, Atmega328 microcontroller,\
    \ DC water \npump, PV module, LM6009 module, LM 2596 module, \nJournal of Automation,\

    39\nArticles\n39\n25%. Anytime these two conditions are active, a relay \nis activated\
    \ to switch the irrigation pump ON. A Short \nMessage Service (SMS) alert is sent\
    \ to the authorized \nuser on the state of the pump and the active mode \nof control.\
    \ The authorized user receives a message \n“Pump ON”, and Control mode: “Auto”.\
    \ At any condi-\ntion outside the aforementioned operational limits, \nthe pump\
    \ state is kept “OFF”, and the state indicates \n“Idle”. These are designed to\
    \ take place without the us-\ners’ input. In addition, users can send a message\
    \ “ON” \nfrom a mobile phone to the SIM number in the system. \nUpon receiving\
    \ this message, the system activates the \nrelay which will in turn activate the\
    \ irrigation pump. \nThe state changes to “Pump ON” and the control mode \nchanges\
    \ to “Remote”. The state is sent as feedback to \nthe remote operator’s mobile\
    \ phone. Upon receiving \nthe message “OFF” from the user, the pump goes off \n\
    and the state returns to “Idle”. This would equally be \nsent as feedback to the\
    \ users’ mobile phone. The user \nalso has the privilege to query the system via\
    \ a sim-\nple SMS command to get the real time soil moisture \nreading, which\
    \ will be sent as a message from the \nsystem to the users’ mobile phone. In the\
    \ event of an \nemergency need of water on site, such as in the case of \nwashing\
    \ harvested farm crops, a manual mini switch \nis provided for the pump on – site.\
    \ The Light Emit-\nting Diode (LED) goes “OFF” in the idle state, “BLUE” \nin\
    \ the remote control state, “GREEN” in the timing \nor soil automation state and\
    \ “RED” in manual oper-\nation mode. One of the peculiarities of this system is\
    \ \nthat users have the privilege of querying the system \nremotely in order to\
    \ get feedback on the real time \nsoil conditions. Upon receiving such command\
    \ via \nthe SMS, the system queries the soil feedback sensor \nand sends the soil\
    \ moisture readings to authorized \nuser(s). For the purpose of this work, only\
    \ one mois-\nture sensor was used and this is shown in Figure 3. \nThe features\
    \ of the soil moisture sensor include: \npower supply (3.3 V–3.5 V), output voltage\
    \ (0–4.2 V), \ncurrent 3.5 mA), size (60 × 20 × 5 mm). It comprises \nof two probes\
    \ which passes current into the soil and \nthereafter reads the electrical resistance\
    \ so as to de-\ntermine the moisture level. High moisture content in \nthe soil\
    \ often triggers high conductivity of electricity \nby the soil and vice versa.\
    \ The output voltage from the \nsoil moisture sensor is then amplified and sent\
    \ to the \nmicro controller where it is converted to digital us-\ning Analogue\
    \ to Digital Converter (ADC). On the con-\ntroller, the voltage is compared to\
    \ the threshold value \npre-set on it, if the measured voltage is less than the\
    \ \nthreshold value, the micro controller activates the re-\nlay which turns ON\
    \ the pump for irrigation activities. \nOn the other hand, if the measured value\
    \ exceeds or \nequal to the threshold, it implies there is no need for \nirrigation\
    \ hence system remains in the idle state with \nthe LED indicating “OFF”.\n2.3.\
    \ Power Provisioning\nFor a continuous and reliable operation of this \nsystem,\
    \ an independent power supply is essential. \nAs such, a PV module, which was\
    \ scaled relative to \nthe power requirement of the DC operated irrigation \n\
    pump, was deployed. The control unit is equipped \nwith a 10,500 mAH lithium ion\
    \ battery backup to \nkeep the system active at night. The power supply \nunit\
    \ of the system is designed to take power also from \nthe PV installation and\
    \ provision power according to \npower requirement of the control sub – systems\
    \ as \nshown in Figure 4.\nFig. 4. Proteus design model of the automated \nirrigation\

    \ in the \nComputer Aided Design (CAD) environment (Fig-\nure 5) and produced\
    \ with the aid of additive manufac-\nturing technique (Figure 6).\nFig. 5. CAD\

    \ \nAutomated Irrigation System\nFor large farms, pump sizing can be easily done\
    \ \nby estimating the water volume requirements of the \nfarm. This would also\
    \ entail appropriate sizing of \nthe solar power system to deliver required power\
    \ to \nthe irrigation pump. Also, the ampere rating of the \nswitching relay in\
    \ the control system will be matched \nadequately with the current demand of the\
    \ pump. \nThe operational indices show that it takes the system \nabout 25 secs\
    \ to boot up when powered ON and about \n5 secs to receive a message instruction\
    \ for pump acti-\nvation. The solar power system delivers about 300 W, \nwith\
    \ the feedback response time from the soil mois-\nture sensor about 0.5 secs and\
    \ the volume of water \npumped approximately 750 L/hr which is adequate \nfor\
    \ small experimental farm. The smart irrigation \nmonitoring is embedded with\
    \ soil moisture sensor to \nsense and obtain the values of moisture for any loca-\n\
    tion to be irrigated. This is a critical factor which pro-\nvides information\
    \ about the condition of the soil to \nbe irrigated so as to determine the need\
    \ for irrigation \nor otherwise as well the quantity of water needed for \nirrigation.\
    \ The system also provides irrigation data \nin terms of the volume of water used\
    \ for irrigation, \nperiod of irrigation as well as the total time spent on \n\
    irrigation, hence the development of the smart irriga-\ntion system provides design\
    \ data for prediction and \nforecasting as well secondary data scaling its devel-\n\
    opment or subsequent redesign.\n2.7 Numerical Experiment\nIn order to develop\
    \ a predictive model for the de-\ntermination of volume of required for irrigation\
    \ and \nstudy the effect of three critical factors that influences \nthe water\
    \ requirement of the soil namely; soil mois-\nture, ambient air temperature and\
    \ humidity, the dy-\nnamic modelling and simulation was carried out using \nthe\
    \ Response Surface Methodology (RSM). While the \nambient air temperature accounts\
    \ for the overall tem-\nperature of the outdoor air where the irrigation activity\
    \ \nis to be performed, humidity represents the amount of \nwater vapour present\
    \ in the air. A multifunctional tem-\nperature and humidity measurement device\
    \ (PCE-THA \n10-ICA) whose temperature measurement ranges from \n–15 to 50° and\
    \ humidity measurement ranges between \n5–95% was employed for measuring both\
    \ the temper-\nature and the humidity of the environment where irri-\ngation activity\
    \ is to be performed. The range of values \nof three critical parameters namely;\
    \ moisture content \n(20–40%), ambient temperature (15–35°C) and hu-\nmidity (10–30%)\
    \ were used as input parameters into \nthe Central Compose Design (CCD) and Response\
    \ Sur-\nface Methodology (RSM) to develop a predictive model \nthat correlates\
    \ the volume of water required for irriga-\ntion purpose as a function of the\
    \ three critical param-\neters. The essence of optimization is to provide an op-\n\
    timum solution for irrigation purpose. The optimum \nsolution include the determination\
    \ of the need for irri-\ngation and the right volume of water required. This will\
    \ \nsave water, time and cost thereby promoting effective \nirrigation process.\
    \ \n3. Results and Discussion\nThe irrigation of small farm land of cross section\
    \ \n100 m × 100 m was carried for three different soil \nsamples namely; sandy,\
    \ loamy and clay soil at five \ndifferent locations between 8:00–8:59 am. The\
    \ data \ncollected from the soil moisture sensor, the multifunc-\ntional temperature\
    \ and humidity measurement de-\nvice and the micro controller are presented in\
    \ Table 1.\nFigure 7 is a plot of volume of water used and the \ntime spent for\
    \ the irrigation for the three soil samples. \nThree critical factors namely;\
    \ soil moisture, ambient \ntemperature and humidity determined the volume of \n\
    water required for irrigation. The water requirement \nwas highest in sandy soil\
    \ and least in clay soil. This \nis due to the fact that the moisture content\
    \ is highest \nin clay and least in sandy soil. The clay soil has high \nwater\
    \ retention ability due to its structure hence the \nreason for the high value\
    \ of its moisture content, fol-\nlowed by loamy soil and then sandy soil. The\
    \ require-\nment of water by the soil was observed to increase as \nthe value\
    \ of soil moisture decreases. \nThe equation of the predictive model is expressed\

    \ irrigation\nThe developed model was validated using the \nAnalysis of Variance\
    \ (ANOVA). It was found to be high-\nly adequate for the prediction of the volume\
    \ of water \nneeded for irrigation as the regression model was \nfound to be highly\
    \ significant at 95% confidence lev-\nel. The correlation coefficients namely;\
    \ the R-squared \n(0.9695), adjusted R-squared (0.9533) and predicted \nR-squared\
    \ (0.9785) were within the same range and \nvery close to 1 for input parameters.\
    \ The closer the \ncorrelation coefficients to 1, the more efficient and re-\n\
    liable the predictive ability of developed model.\nFigure 8 is a 3 D plot that\
    \ studies the effect of the \ninteraction of humidity and temperature on the need\
    \ \nfor irrigation as well as the volume of water required. \nHumidity is the\
    \ amount of water vapour present in \nthe air. It is high when the amount of water\
    \ vapour in \nthe air is high while the ambient temperature is the \ndegree of\
    \ hotness or coldness of the air in the envi-\nronment.\nHumidity increases as\
    \ the amount of water vapour \nin the air is increases. From Figure 8, the relationship\
    \ \nbetween the humidity and temperature is inversely \nproportional. Keeping\
    \ the percent moisture content \nconstant at 23.02%, the percent humidity increas-\n\
    es as ambient temperature decreases. This is due to \nthe fact that air tend to\
    \ hold more water molecules as \nambient temperature increases hence the relative\
    \ hu-\nmidity decreases. The optimum volume of the water \nrequired for irrigation\
    \ is 1025 litres.\nFigure 9 is a 3 D plot that studies the effect of the \ninteraction\
    \ of soil humidity and temperature on the \nneed for irrigation as well as the\
    \ volume of water re-\nquired. As temperature increases, percent moisture \ncontent\
    \ decreases. This is due to the fact that the rate \nof evaporation increases\
    \ with increase in tempera-\nture with attendant decrease in the moisture content.\
    \ \nThe optimum value of the volume required for irriga-\ntion is 1060.9 litres.\n\

    The development of the automated irrigated was \nsuccessful carried out in a CAD\
    \ environment and \nproduced with the aid of additive manufacturing \ntechnique.\
    \ It offers the benefits of improved farming \npractices via automation which\
    \ enhances agricultural \nproductivity and encourages round – the – year farm-\n\
    ing, efficient water distribution and management, \nwhile reducing the drudgery\
    \ of manual labour, real \ntime monitoring and control as well as proper sched-\n\
    uling of irrigation activities and enhances multiple \nmode of operation with\
    \ query and feedback mecha-\nnism. The work is an improvement over existing work\
    \ \nin that the ease of operation comes with its multiple \nmodes of operation\
    \ which affords user convenient \nchoices of operation. Also, a predictive model\
    \ that \ncorrelates the volume of required as a function of \nthe soil moisture,\
    \ air temperature and humidity was \ndeveloped. This will assist in predicting\
    \ the time nec-\nessary for irrigation as well as the volume of water \nrequired\
    \ for the irrigation process. \nPUBLIC INTEREST STATEMENT\nThis work is in line\
    \ with the quest to improve \nfood security via the deployment of appropriate\
    \ tech-\nnology for farm irrigation in order to improve crop \nyields and ease\
    \ human drudgery. With the increasing \nawareness and advocacy for round-the-year\
    \ farming, \nand the need to meet up with the global challenge of \nfood demand,\
    \ deploying appropriate technologies to \nincrease productivity and to reduce\
    \ the burden often \nassociated with farm practices has become inevitable \nhence\
    \ this work provides a standalone automated ir-\nrigation system which features\
    \ good automation and \ncontrol achieved using an array of electronic timing \n\
    system, soil feedback sensor and wireless communi-\ncation system.\nAUTHORS\n\

    \ success in health care, smart city,\nindustrial production and so on. Protected\
    \ agriculture is one of the ﬁelds which has broad application\nprospects of IoT.\
    \ Protected agriculture is a mode of highly eﬃcient development of modern agriculture\n\
    that uses artiﬁcial techniques to change climatic factors such as temperature,\
    \ to create environmental\nconditions suitable for the growth of animals and plants.\
    \ This review aims to gain insight into\nthe state-of-the-art of IoT applications\
    \ in protected agriculture and to identify the system structure\nand key technologies.\
    \ Therefore, we completed a systematic literature review of IoT research\nand\
    \ deployments in protected agriculture over the past 10 years and evaluated the\
    \ contributions\nmade by diﬀerent academicians and organizations. Selected references\
    \ were clustered into three\napplication domains corresponding to plant management,\
    \ animal farming and food/agricultural\nproduct supply traceability. Furthermore,\
    \ we discussed the challenges along with future research\nprospects, to help new\
    \ researchers of this domain understand the current research progress of IoT in\n\
    protected agriculture and to propose more novel and innovative ideas in the future.\n\

    1. Introduction\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) was ﬁrst developed in 1999 by the\
    \ network radio frequency\nidentiﬁcation (RFID) system proposed by the Massachusetts\
    \ Institute of Technology (MIT) Auto-ID\nLabs [1]. With the application and development\
    \ of new information technologies, the connotation\nand extension of IoT have\
    \ undergone major changes [2]. IoT can be deﬁned as a huge internet-based\nnetwork\
    \ connecting physical and virtual “things” with standard and interoperable communication\n\
    protocols. To be speciﬁc, everything, such as a sensor and an actuator possessing\
    \ unique identity\nand attribute, exchange messages and communicate with each\
    \ other to realize intelligent positioning,\ntracking, identiﬁcation, perception,\
    \ monitoring and management via kinds of networks anytime and\nanywhere [3]. IoT\
    \ has penetrated pervasively most aspects of human life everywhere such as health\n\
    care, smart home, smart city, industrial control and so on. Agriculture is an\
    \ ideal candidate for the\ndeployment of IoT solutions because it occurs in wide\
    \ areas that need to be continuously monitored\nand controlled [4,5].\nThe concept\
    \ of protected agriculture is relative to open-ﬁeld agriculture. It uses artiﬁcial\
    \ techniques\nto change climatic factors such as natural light, temperature and\
    \ humidity to create environmental\nconditions suitable for the growth of animals\
    \ and plants, enabling them to grow around the clock.\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833;\

    2 of 24\nThe environment of protected agriculture is completely or largely artiﬁcially\
    \ controlled andwhich has\nbroken the limits of climate and land conditions for\
    \ the growth of animals and plants to a certain extent.\nSo it is also called\
    \ controllable agriculture. Compared with open-ﬁeld agriculture, protected agriculture\n\
    has more potential to apply IoT technology, because it is less aﬀected by climatic\
    \ and geographical\nfactors. Some mature IoT solutions in other ﬁelds can be transferred\
    \ directly to protected agriculture [6].\nWith the development of agricultural\
    \ sensor, wireless communication, cloud computing,\nmachine learning and Big Data\
    \ technologies, IoT technology has emerged and is gradually being\npromoted and\
    \ applied in the protected agriculture ﬁeld [7–9]. It is playing an important\
    \ role in various\nareas of protected agriculture as it is capable of helping\
    \ farmers monitor soil condition, climate change\nand animal and plant health\
    \ [10]. When the environmental factor change beyond the set threshold,\nIoT will\
    \ automatically send a warning message to the administrator to remove the hidden\
    \ danger.\nIt can also control environmental factors such as temperature, humidity,\
    \ carbon dioxide concentration\nand illumination according to the condition of\
    \ crop growth in real time [11,12]. In addition, cameras in\nthe IoT system are\
    \ able to capture crop diseases and insect pests in the greenhouse in real time,\n\
    helping farmers ﬁnd problems and take targeted preventive measures [13]. Through\
    \ GPS, RFID and\nother location-based sensors, goods such as vegetables can be\
    \ tracked and monitored visually during\ntransportation and storage. Supermarket\
    \ managers use smart phone or PC to monitor and predict\nproduct status and the\
    \ demand for getting product on shelves. At the user or consumer end, people can\n\
    query the variety, origin, processing and other farm product information by means\
    \ of the QR code,\nbarcode, etc. IoT for protected agriculture can help create\
    \ an informed, connected, developed and\nadaptable rural community. Low-cost embedded\
    \ devices can improve the interaction between humans\nand the physical world.\
    \ Cloud computing, edge computing, and Big Data can provide valuable analysis\n\
    and support for decisions. In summary, IoT will become an important tool in the\
    \ next few years to\nengage people in embedded agriculture which includes suppliers,\
    \ farmers, technicians, distributors,\nmerchants, consumers and government representatives\
    \ [14,15].\nOn the basis of the potential of IoT applications in protected agriculture\
    \ described in the previous\nparagraphs, this paper aims to identify the current\
    \ state of solutions in these ﬁelds. The IoT fundamental\nstructure in protected\
    \ agriculture is introduced in detail based on agricultural sensors, wireless\
    \ sensor\nnetworks, cloud computing, edge clouding and machine learning technologies.\
    \ The application of IoT\nin protected agriculture and how it makes contributions\
    \ is displayed. Furthermore, the open issues,\nchallenges, future opportunities\
    \ and development trends are discussed.\nIn this article, a comprehensive and\
    \ profound review of IoT in protected agriculture has been\nexecuted based on\
    \ a survey of real-world deployments and published papers over the past 10 years.\n\
    Firstly, a keyword-based search for conference papers and articles was performed\
    \ mainly from the\nscientiﬁc databases IEEE Xplore, Science Direct and ACM Digital\
    \ as well as from Google Scholar.\nFor search keywords, we used the following\
    \ query: “Internet of Things” and either “greenhouse”\nor “livestock” or “aquaculture“\
    \ or “agriculture“. Then, we ﬁltered out papers referring to IoT but\nnot applied\
    \ to the protected agricultural domain. Finally, we checked these papers selected\
    \ from the\nprevious step and picked out the ﬁnal papers according to the problem\
    \ they addressed, the solution\nproposed, impact achieved (if measurable), tools,\
    \ systems and algorithms used.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows.\
    \ Section 2 presents the structure of IoT in protected\nagriculture. The key technologies\
    \ of IoT in protected agriculture are introduced in Section 3. The three\nimportant\
    \ applications in protected agriculture are summed up in Section 4. We further\
    \ discussed\nthe challenges to be faced and the problems that need to be solved\
    \ for IoT in protected agriculture as\nwell as a few future development directions\
    \ in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 outlines the conclusions of\nthis paper.\n\

    2.1. Simple Review of Previous IoT Structure\nAt present, there is no uniﬁed opinion\
    \ on the structure of IoT. The composition of IoT can be\ndivided into three parts:\
    \ object end, cloud end and network end. Smart items, smart devices and\nlocal\
    \ intelligent systems interact directly with the physical world to form the “object\
    \ end” of IoT\n(also known as “front end”). The cloud computing platform that\
    \ provides computing, storage and\nother resources performs fusion processing\
    \ and intelligent analysis of the sensing data from the object\nend and performs\
    \ execution control to constitute the “cloud end” (also referred to as “back end”)\
    \ of\nIoT. The communication infrastructure of the connection object end and the\
    \ cloud end constitutes the\n“network end” of IoT. According to the diﬀerent functions\
    \ implemented by physical entity services\nin the IoT, IoT architecture established\
    \ by the current service-oriented approach can be divided into\nthe following\
    \ two categories: cloud-centric IoT architecture and object-centric IoT architecture.\
    \ In the\ncloud-centric IoT application system, the physical entity service implements\
    \ basic physical information\ncollection, local information processing and transmission\
    \ of information to the cloud, but does not\nprovide a directly accessible service\
    \ interface. Mass storage, relational processing and knowledge\nmining of physical\
    \ information are all implemented in the cloud. One of their typical representatives\n\
    is uID IoT architecture, which is an IoT architecture developed by the uID center\
    \ of the nonproﬁt\nstandardization organization initiated by the university of\

    \ such as RFID, bar codes, RF and IR beacons, user terminals,\na ucode resolution\
    \ server and application information servers [16]. For software developers, the\
    \ main\nchallenge in building such systems is how to build a back-end cloud service\
    \ platform that supports\nmassive item information management and data processing.\

    \ a five-layer IoT architecture [22]. As shown in Figure 5, these layers are briefly\
    \ described \nbelow: \n(1). Perception layer: This layer consists of various sensors,\
    \ terminal devices, agricultural \nmachinery, wireless sensor network (WSN), RFID\
    \ tags andreaders, etc. The common sensors \nare environmental sensors, animal\
    \ and plant life information sensors and other sensors related \nto agriculture.\
    \ Through these sensors, information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed,\
    \ \nplant diseases, insect pests and animal vital signs can be obtained. The collected\
    \ information is \nsimply processed by the embedded device and uploaded to a higher\
    \ layer through the \nnetwork layer for further processing and analysis. \n(2).\
    \ Network layer: The network layer is the infrastructure of IoT, which includes\
    \ a converged \nnetwork formed by various communication networks and the internet.\
    \ The transmission \nmedium can be wired technology such as CAN bus and RS485\
    \ bus or wireless technology like \nZigbee, Bluetooth, LoRa and NB-IoT. The network\
    \ layer not only transmits various kinds of \nagricultural related information\

    \ control commands of the application layer to the perception layer, so that the\
    \ related \ndevices of the sensing layer take corresponding actions.  \n(3). Middleware\

    \ and communicated with each other, \nwhich leads to heterogeneity problems. The\
    \ middleware layer aggregates, filters and processes \nreceived data from IoT\
    \ devices, which greatly reduces the processing time and cost of the \nabove issues\
    \ and provides developers with a more versatile tool to build their applications.\

    \ of IoT. In recent years, sensor technology\nhas rapidly developed with the emergence\
    \ of new materials and methods [23]. The conventional\nenvironment sensors such\
    \ as temperature, humidity, light intensity, heat and gas sensors have been\n\
    relatively mature and widely deployed in protected agriculture. Nowaday, about\
    \ 6000 research and\nproduction organizations engage in sensor research from more\
    \ than 40 countries, including famous\nmanufacturers such as Honeywell, Foxboro,\
    \ ENDEVCO, Bell & Howell and Solartron companies.\nThere are three main types\
    \ of widely used and researched agricultural sensors: physical property type\n\
    sensors, biosensors and micro electro mechanical system sensors (MEMS). The physical\
    \ property type\nsensor realizes the signal conversion through the physical change\
    \ of the sensitivity of the material\nof the sensor itself, which is mainly temperature,\
    \ humidity and gas sensor. The biosensor [24] uses\nthe organism itself as a sensitive\
    \ component to transmit information according to the reaction of the\norganism\
    \ to the outside world and includes enzyme sensor [25], microbial sensor, adaptive\
    \ sensor [26],\netc., which is mainly used to detect pesticide residue, heavy\

    and chemical properties of soil turn the rapid and situ measurement of soil nitrogen\
    \ and other elements\ninto an international diﬃculty. Since the life process of\
    \ animals and plants is very complicated, in order\nto realize the accurate detection\
    \ of information about their life, it is necessary to make breakthroughs in\n\
    the physical mechanism and measurement model of the life process. Related research\
    \ has been carried\nout using physicochemical properties, spectroscopy, multispectral,\
    \ hyper-spectral, nuclear magnetic\nresonance as well as other detection methods\
    \ [30–33].\nAnother problem is the promotion and application of these sensors.\
    \ For one thing there is still\na lack of uniform technical standards in the collection,\
    \ transmission and the interface with the platform\nand human-computer interaction\
    \ interface; for another, the cost has limited the large scale application\nof\
    \ fresh sensors in intelligent agriculture. Currently, the cost of sensing equipment\
    \ for the collection and\ntransmission of animal and plant status is prohibitively\
    \ expensive for ordinary peasants. The number\nof nodes in a sensor network can\
    \ often reach tens of thousands. To make the sensor network practical,\nthe cost\
    \ of each node must be controlled within $1, but now the price is as high as $80\
    \ [34].\n3.2. Data Transmission Technology\nIn this section, the details of data\
    \ transmission technology are discussed, which is one of the vital\ntechnologies\
    \ for real-time dynamic acquisition of agricultural information. Diﬀerent from\
    \ industrial\napplication, agricultural information acquisition is not demanding\
    \ in timelines and a slight delay in\nthe transmission process has little eﬀect\
    \ on agricultural production.\nCompared with wired transmission technology such\
    \ as ﬁeldbus, wireless communication\ntechnology has advantages of low construction\
    \ and maintenance cost, low power consumption\nand excellent extensibility. Recently,\
    \ most researchers, organizations and manufacturers choose it\nto build up their\
    \ WSN in environment monitoring [35,36], automatic irrigation [37] and remote\n\
    control [38]. As shown in Table 1, the summary of popular wireless technologies\
    \ and basic parameters\nwas presented. Diﬀerent vendors and research institutes\
    \ have developed their own wireless devices\nbased on these wireless protocols,\
    \ which has somewhat increased the heterogeneity of IoT. In addition,\nwireless\
    \ signals of diﬀerent protocols located in the same band can cause mutual interference\
    \ such as\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n8 of 24\nZigBee, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth [39].\
    \ Wi-Fi has high communication speed but high power consumption,\nwhich is suitable\
    \ for sensor network deployment at ﬁxed points. Although Bluetooth has high security,\n\
    its communication distance is too short and power consumption is high, which is\
    \ suitable for short-time\nclose-range networking. ZigBee has the advantages of\
    \ low consumption, low cost and self-organization\nand each node can be used as\
    \ a relay station for transmitting data of adjacent nodes. So it easily expands\n\
    the coverage of the sensor network and is an ideal long-distance, large-range\
    \ sensor networking.\nTable 1. Summary of popular wireless technologies and basic\

    \ mW\nIn recent years, the Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) is one of IoT hotspots\
    \ and\nthought as a novel technology with great development potential, which is\
    \ attributed to its huge\nadvantages such as ultra-long distance communication\
    \ and it can be used as an important complement\nof the traditional wireless local\
    \ area network (WLAN) and mobile cellular mobile communication\ntechnologies (such\
    \ as GSM and GPRS). At this stage, LPWAN has many technical standards, which can\n\
    be classiﬁed into two categories. The ﬁrst is a proprietary patented technology\
    \ that works under\nan unlicensed spectrum, such as LoRa, Sigfox and RPMA. The\
    \ second is a cellular communication\ntechnology that works under a licensed spectrum,\
    \ such as EC-GSM, eMTC and NB-IoT. Due to the use\nof dedicated frequency bands\
    \ and uniﬁed deployment by operators, licensed spectrum technology\nhas carrier-class\
    \ security and low interference characteristics, which forms full network coverage\n\
    and operation [40,41]. The unlicensed spectrum uses the common spectrum without\
    \ paying high\nspectrum costs but requires special handling of co-channel interference.\
    \ There are many beneﬁts of IoT\ndeployments based on LPWAN in the agricultural\
    \ environment. Firstly, the maximum connection\ndistance of the LPWAN terminal\
    \ device to the base station varies from several kilometers to several tens\n\
    of kilometers, which saves the trouble of setting up and maintaining routing devices.\
    \ Compared with\nthe 2.4 GHz band, LPWAN adopts the sub-1GHz band to acquire less\
    \ attenuation and multipath\nfading caused by obstacles and dense surfaces like\
    \ concrete walls [42,43]. Moverover, the sensitivity\nof state of the art LPWAN\
    \ receivers reaches as low as –130 dBm due to modulation techniques such\nas narrowband\
    \ and spread spectrum. Secondly, ultra low power operation is another advantage\
    \ of\nLPWAN which is achieved by duty cycling mechanism, lightweight medium access\
    \ control protocols\nand oﬄoading complex tasks [44]. Thirdly, most LPWAN technologies\
    \ support a large number of\ndevice connections by diversity techniques, adaptive\
    \ channel selection and data rate technologies,\netc. [45]. Finally, the LPWAN\
    \ connects a large number of end devices, while keeping the cost of\nhardware\
    \ below ﬁve dollars [46]. LPWAN technologies target a diverse set of applications\
    \ with varying\nrequirements in protected agriculture and therefore it should\
    \ provide some sort of quality of service\n(QoS) over the same underlying LPWAN\
    \ technology. However, current LPWAN technologies provide\nno or limited QoS.\n\
    Sensors 2019, 19, 1833\n9 of 24\nMeanwhile, mobile cellular communication technology\
    \ has undergone four generations of\ntechnology updates and the ﬁfth-generation\
    \ mobile communication technology (5G) was announced in\n2016, which will make\
    \ large ﬁle transfer such as agricultural images and audio a reality and bring\
    \ new\nimpetus to the agricultural IoT. From the perspective of future research,\
    \ the research of wireless sensor\nnetworks focuses mainly on communication, energy\
    \ conservation, network control and its application\nin agricultural monitoring.\n\
    3.3. WSN\nThe WSN consists of a lot of sensor nodes that are usually powered by\
    \ battery and it is a multi-hop\nself-organizing network system formed by wireless\
    \ communication to collaboratively sense, collect and\nprocess various information\
    \ of the perceived object in the network coverage area [47,48]. It can be\ndivided\
    \ into terrestrial WSN and wireless underground sensor networks (WUSN). The agricultural\n\
    sensors are usually planted into soil and lower frequency wireless technologies\
    \ are more selected\ndue to low attenuation in WUSN. Besides, antenna size and\
    \ energy consumption in WUSN is higher\nthan terrestrial WSN [49]. With development\
    \ of LPWAN, IoT may not need a mesh-style WSN with\npower-based routing, where\
    \ one node forwards packets of other nodes.\n3.4. Cloud Computing\nCloud computing\
    \ grew out of distributed computing, parallel processing and grid computing.\n\
    It is an Internet-based computing system that provides hardware services, infrastructure\
    \ services,\nplatform services, software services and storage services to various\
    \ IoT applications. Its essence is\na system for dynamically deploying and allocating/redistributing\
    \ as well as dynamic monitoring\nof virtualized computing and storage resource\
    \ pools, thereby providing users with computing,\ndata storage and platform services\
    \ that meet QoS requirements [50,51]. It played a strong role in\npromoting the\
    \ development of agricultural IoT. Firstly, cloud computing can provide farmers\
    \ with cheap\ndata storage services for text, image, video and other agricultural\
    \ information, which greatly reduces\nthe storage costs of agricultural enterprises\
    \ [52]. Secondly, it is diﬃcult to make direct use of these raw\ndata for making\
    \ decisions based on the technical level of farmers. Agricultural experts can\
    \ only make\naccurate judgments and give suggestions based on quantitative analysis.\
    \ Only cloud computing can\nsupport intelligent large-scale computing systems\
    \ [53,54]. Thirdly, cloud computing could provide\na secure platform for the development\
    \ of various IoT applications such as crop monitoring [55].\n3.5. Edge Computing\n\
    Edge computing refers to a new computing model that performs calculations at the\
    \ edge of the\nnetwork [56]. In the edge computing, the downlink data of the edge\
    \ represents the cloud service,\nthe uplink data represents IoT service and the\
    \ edge of edge computing refers to any computing\nand network resources between\
    \ the data source and the cloud computing center path. Because the\ncomputing\
    \ task is partially migrated to the network edge device, edge hormone can improve\
    \ data\ntransmission performance, ensure real-time processing and reduce the computational\
    \ load of the cloud\ncomputing center. Moreover, edge computing better protects\
    \ data because processing occurs closer to\nthe source than in cloud computing\
    \ [57,58].\n3.6. Machine Learning\nMachine learning (ML) is a smart way for computers\
    \ to simulate people’s learning activities, acquire\nnew knowledge, continuously\
    \ improve performance and implement their own perfection. In recent\nyears, machine\
    \ learning has achieved great success in algorithm, theory and application [59]\
    \ and have\nbeen combined with other agricultural technologies to maximized crop\
    \ yield while minimizing the input\ncosts [60]. The main machine learning algorithms\
    \ are naïve bayes, discriminant analysis, K-nearest\nneighbor, support vector\
    \ machine (SVM) [61], K-means clusterin, fuzzy clustering, gaussian mixture\n\
    models, artiﬁcial neural network (ANN), deep learning [62], decision tree algorithm\
    \ and so on [63].\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n10 of 24\nML can discover the internal\
    \ connection between messy, modelless and complex agricultural\ndata, make accurate\
    \ predictions and provide a theoretical basis for agricultural decision-making.\n\
    Machinelearning technology is playing an important role in crop breeding, disease\
    \ identiﬁcation,\npest and disease prediction, intelligent irrigation planning\
    \ and agricultural expert systems [64–67].\nFor example, ML technology can analyze\
    \ past farmland data, including the performance of crops under\ndiﬀerent climatic\
    \ conditions and the inheritance of a particular phenotype. As well, ML technology\n\
    can explore the association rules and then build a probability model to predict\
    \ which genes are\nmost likely to participate in the expression of a certain good\
    \ trait of the plant, which can help the\nbreeding expert conduct a reasonable\
    \ breeding experiment [68–70]. Kyosuke et al. came up with\na method for detecting\
    \ the maturity of a single intact tomato-based ML, which consisted of three\n\
    steps: pixel-based segmentation, blob-based segmentation and individual fruit\
    \ detection. In the ﬁrst\ntwo steps, decision trees were generated based on features\
    \ such as color, shape, texture and size and\nimage segmentations were conducted\
    \ using the generated trees. Finally, the automatical detection of\nindividual\
    \ fruit in multiple tomatoes was achieved by X-means clustering method. The results\
    \ of the\ntomato detection image test showed that their method achieved a recall\
    \ of 0.80, while the precision\nwas 0.88 [71]. Rahnemoonfar et al. proposed deep\
    \ learning architecture for counting fruits based\non convolutional neural networks.\
    \ They used synthetic images to train the neural network to save\ntime-consuming\
    \ collect and annotate. The network was trained for three epochs on 24,000 synthetic\n\
    images using an Adam optimizer and 100 randomly chosen images were tested. The\
    \ experimental\nresults demonstrated that their method had higher average accuracy\
    \ as comparing with others [72].\n3.7. Big Data\nThe protected agriculture produces\
    \ billions of dynamic, complex and spatial data including soil\ndatabases, greenhouse\
    \ environment data, livestock vaccination records and government investment\n\
    data. Compared with relational data structures that are logically expressed using\
    \ two-dimensional\ntables, agricultural data is more unstructured and has a large\
    \ number of hypermedia elements\nsuch as expert experience, knowledge and agricultural\
    \ models in the form of text, charts, pictures,\nanimations and voice/video [73].\
    \ The “big” of these data can be reﬂected in four dimensions: volume,\nvelocity,\
    \ variety and veracity [74]. Big Data technology is able to ﬁnd out the internal\
    \ links of collected\ndata through information mining and other means, discover\
    \ new information and provide data support\nfor the next operation. The most commonly\
    \ used techniques to deal with Big Data technology are\nimage processing, modeling\
    \ and simulation, machine learning, statistical analysis and geographical\ninformation\
    \ systems (GIS) [75].\n4. IoT Applications in Protected Agriculture\n4.1. Plant\
    \ Management\nCompared with open-ﬁeld agriculture, protected agriculture provides\
    \ a relatively suitable and\ncontrollable environment for crop growth by greenhouse\
    \ technology, which to some extent is free\nfrom the constraints of the natural\
    \ environment and promoted the intensive and eﬃcient use of\nagricultural resources.\
    \ However, spatial and temporal variability of crops’ growth environmental\nparameters\
    \ in the protected agriculture are strong and aﬀect each other [76,77], which\
    \ made it diﬃcult\nto adapt to the growth of diﬀerent types of plants in diﬀerent\
    \ growth stages by traditional cultivation\nand environmental regulation. Therefore,\
    \ it needs higher accuracy in the aspect of monitoring and\ncontrol. Many works\
    \ have attempted to design and test types of monitoring and control systems to\n\
    adjust greenhouse environmental parameters such as air temperature and humidity,\
    \ light intensity\nand CO2 concentration based on IoT and their results have proven\
    \ it is technically and economically\nfeasible [78]. At the low level of IoT development,\
    \ the environmental data were simply processed and\nusually presented in sheet\
    \ and plot form [79,80]. Later, some studies collected huge amounts of data\n\
    to set up various models based on plant growth or greenhouse climate [81–83],\
    \ which contributed\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n11 of 24\nto predicting the crop\
    \ yield and environment parameter changes to help farmers better manage\ngreenhouse.\
    \ CAI et al. developed a low-cost smart greenhouse remote monitor system based\
    \ on IoT.\nThe system used STM32F103 single chip machine and sensors to collect\
    \ environmental information\nand transferred the data to cloud by LPWAN. Security\
    \ link was established with TLS, which reduced\nsystem costs while ensuring the\
    \ security of data transmission. At the same time, they adopted a time\nseries\
    \ database to store data so that tremendous storage space can be saved [84]. He\
    \ et al. have reported\na greenhouse temperature intelligent control system based\
    \ on NB-IoT. The relative error of greenhouse\nenvironmental information collection\
    \ was below 1%, the average control accuracy was 3.57% (±1.0 ◦C),\nthe transmission\
    \ distance was not limited and the automatic regulation of crop growth temperature\n\
    was realized [85].\nNowaday, with the development of cloud computing, ML, etc.,\
    \ IoT solution can easily achieve\nsmart data processing and analyzing at low\
    \ cost and in a convenient way [86,87]. At the same time,\ngreenhouse technology\
    \ has also undergone several generations of upgrades and has now evolved into\n\
    highly mechanized and automated plant factories. Deng et al. have implemented\
    \ a closed-loop control\nsystem in a salad-cultivating plant factory based on\
    \ the kinetic model. Both digital simulation and\nreal-time results demonstrated\
    \ the system can work stably under the internal variations and external\ndisturbances\
    \ [88]. Zamora-Izquierdo et al. developed a smart farming IoT platform based on\
    \ edge and\ncloud computing, which was designed for soilless culture greenhouses\
    \ at low cost. The platform was\ncomposed of local, edge and cloud parts: the\
    \ local part dealt with data gathering and automatic control\nthough Cyber-Physical\
    \ Systems, the edge part took main management tasks and could improve the\nstability\
    \ of this systems, the cloud part was in charge of data analytics. Compared with\
    \ a regular\nopen control, the platform saved more than 30% water [89]. Katsoulas\
    \ et al. have designed an\nonline irrigation system for hydroponic greenhouse\
    \ crops and their results indicated it increased\nwater and fertilizer use eﬃciency\
    \ by 100% [90]. Liao et al. implemented a IoT-based system in\nan orchid greenhouse\
    \ to monitor the environmental factors and the growth status of phalaenopsis.\n\
    They developed an image processing algorithm to estimate the leaf area of phalaenopsisthe\
    \ and\nidentiﬁed the relationship between growth of plant leaves and environmental\
    \ factors. The proposed\nsystem could provide quantitative information with high\
    \ spatiotemporal resolution for ﬂoral farmers\nand contribute to updating farming\
    \ strategies for phalaenopsis in the future [91].\nDiseases and insect pests bring\
    \ a great threat to the growth of crops as and traditional technology\nand chemical\
    \ prevention and control has a certain lag and negative impact [92,93]. The rise\
    \ of IoT\nhas brought more eﬃcient and smarter solutions to crop disease and pest\
    \ control. Many types of\nIoT sensors can collect information about location,\
    \ greenhouse environment status, crop growth and\npest situation anywhere in real-time,\
    \ which helps farmers keep track of crop pests and diseases.\nThen, all raw image\
    \ and data are sent to cloud centers and later processed and analyzed by various\n\
    models and algorithms based on diﬀerent diseases and pests [94,95]. Finally, these\
    \ cloud centers\ngenerally provide farmers with the following services: disease\
    \ or pest identiﬁcation, disaster prediction\nand warning and recommended governance\
    \ measures from expert systems. Tirelli et al. proposed\na pest insect trap automatic\
    \ monitoring system using ZigBee technology, which can estimate the\ninsect density\
    \ by collected data from diﬀerent sites and send a warning message to farmers\
    \ when it\nexceeded the set value [96]. Ahouandjinou et al. proposed a pest monitoring\
    \ system which detected\nthe presence of pests by the acquisition of ultrasound\
    \ and assisted others in building up protocols\nfor early exterminate of the pests\
    \ [97]. Foughali et al. presented a potato late blight prevention and\ndecision\
    \ support system using cloud IoT and helped the agriculturists take eﬀective action\
    \ to treat\nthis disease [98]. Both Semios and Spensa Company launched their own\
    \ integrated pest management\nsystem, which was able to count the number of pests\
    \ by images, as well as characterize and capture\nthe insects. At present, pest\
    \ and disease warning research mainly provides medium and long-term\nwarning based\
    \ on historical data, which can provide macro guidance for crop production but\
    \ low\ntimeliness. Therefore, future research should focus on online monitoring\
    \ as well as diagnosis and early\nwarning of agricultural diseases.\nSensors 2019,\
    \ 19, 1833\n12 of 24\n4.2. Animal Farming\nLivestock and aquatic product farming\
    \ is an important part of protected agriculture and an area\nwhere IoT applications\
    \ have achieved good results. To achieve good control eﬀects in animal breeding,\n\
    IoT should not only overcome harsh environmental factors, but also pay attention\
    \ to the eﬀects of animal\nbehaviors [99,100]. IoT have been applied in monitoring\
    \ and management of environment, animal,\nfeed and farming process [101,102].\
    \ The livestock monitoring items include information such as body\ntemperature,\
    \ weight, behavior, exercise volume, food intake, disease information and environmental\n\
    factors, which can help people understand animal’s own physiological and nutritional\
    \ status and\nadaptability to external environmental conditions. In aquaculture,\
    \ management projects focus on water\nquality such as dissolved oxygen content,\
    \ water temperature and pH value [103,104] because water\nquality greatly aﬀects\
    \ the growth of aquatic animals. With animal growth and nutrient optimization\n\
    model and intelligent IoT equipment, it is possible to realiaze automatic feeding\
    \ and optimal control of\nfeeding time and intake according to their growth cycle,\
    \ individual quality, feeding cycle and eating\nsituation [105,106]. The Osborne\
    \ Industrial Company has produced TEAM automated electronic sow\nfeeding (ESF)\
    \ stations including pregnancy stations and estrus detection stations. The ESF\
    \ stations\nidentify the sow through the RFID tags worn by each sow and deliver\
    \ the corresponding quantity\nand type of feed based on information such as parity,\
    \ lyrical condition and gestational age. The estrus\ndetection stations can detect\
    \ rutting sows in the sow population and their detection accuracy is 7%\nhigher\
    \ than the manual ones. Encinas et al. presented a distributed monitoring IoT\
    \ system for\nwater quality monitoring. Their model was able to help ﬁsheries\
    \ acquire water quality parameters\nsuch as pH and temperature data in real time\
    \ to optimize pond resources and prevent unwanted\nconditions [107]. Soto-Zarazu´a\
    \ et al. proposed an automated recirculation tilapia farming system\nbased on\
    \ the fuzzy algorithm. The results of this work showed that it saved water by\
    \ 97.42% and\nthe water quality environmental parameters were controlled within\
    \ the acceptable range of tilapia\nculture [108]. Many researches have focused\
    \ on analysis of animal behavior, health care and diagnosis\nand warning of diseases\
    \ based on IoT [109–111]. Yazdanbakhsh et al. proposed an intelligent livestock\n\
    surveillance system. They attempted many machine learning algorithms to process\
    \ raw data of\nhealthy and ill cows and ﬁnally obtained good results used a wavelet-domain\
    \ ensemble classiﬁer with\n80.8% sensitivity and 80% speciﬁcity [112]. Wens Group,\
    \ the largest livestock breeding enterprise\nin China, took the lead in carrying\
    \ out research on the animal husbandry based on IoT and built\nthe corresponding\
    \ system for monitoring livestock vital signs, behavior and breeding environment\n\
    information [113]. Liu et al. collected a variety of penaeus vannamei information\
    \ such as real-time data\non the culture environment, disease image data and expert\
    \ disease diagnosis and treatment and ﬁnally,\nconstructed a remote intelligent\
    \ diagnosis model based on IoT [114]. Liu et al. proposed a web-based\ncombined\
    \ nutritional model for precisely predicting the growth, feed amount and nitrogen\
    \ phosphorus\noutput of gibel carp [115]. The current online diagnostics and early\
    \ warning of animal diseases is at an\nearly stage due to the lack of corresponding\
    \ sensors and models. With upgrading of hardware and\nartiﬁcial intelligence algorithms,\
    \ future research should focus on the improvement of Big Data depth\nalgorithm\
    \ and the establishment of comprehensive models of animal behavior and disease.\n\
    A few studies have made in-depth research in monitoring animal odor and hazardous\
    \ gas\nproduced during the breeding process such as ammonia gas and sulfur dioxide\
    \ [116]. Pan developed\nan electronic nose network system for monitoring and real-time\
    \ analysis of odors from livestock\nfarms. They placed e-noses in and around the\
    \ farm to build up a wireless network to measure odor\ncompounds as well as environmental\
    \ parameters [117].\n4.3. Agri-food Supply Chain Traceability\nNowday, agricultural\
    \ products/food safety issues are receiving worldwide attention and their\nsafety\
    \ traceability is one solution accepted by all parties of Agri-food domains. Governments\
    \ in many\ncountries and regions have promulgated laws and regulations to promote\
    \ the establishment of food\ntraceability system and strengthen the supervision\
    \ of agricultural products/food safety. The Agri-food\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n\
    13 of 24\nsupply chain traceability IoT-based system can ensure food safety and\
    \ quality at each link of the\nproduction, from the cropland to the consumer (Figure\
    \ 6), which could help consumers establish\nconﬁdence in food safety and contribute\
    \ to sustainable development of the whole food industry [118].\n \n4.3. Agri-food\
    \ Supply Chain Traceability \nNowday, agricultural products/food safety issues\
    \ are receiving worldwide attention and their \nsafety traceability is one solution\
    \ accepted by all parties of Agri-food domains. Governments in \nmany countries\
    \ and regions have promulgated laws and regulations to promote the establishment\
    \ of \nfood traceability system and strengthen the supervision of agricultural\
    \ products/food safety. The \nAgri-food supply chain traceability IoT-based system\
    \  can ensure food safety and quality at each \nlink of the production, from the\
    \ cropland to the consumer (Figure 6), which could help consumers \nestablish\
    \ confidence in food safety and contribute to sustainable development of the whole\
    \ food \nindustry [118].  \n \nFigure 6. Schematic representation of the Agri-food\
    \ supply chain from the grower to consumer. \nIn past years, a lot of countries\
    \ have established the traceability platform for meat,milk, fish and \nagri-food\
    \ products based on IoT [119–121]. However, the fresh food cold chain logistics\
    \ traceability \nhas also drawn widespread attention [122,123]. RFID technology\
    \ still played an important role in \nAgri-food supply chain traceability due\
    \ to its small size and low cost [124]. As a novel technology, \nnear field communication\
    \ (NFC) has been progressively developed and used because of its safe and \nsimple\
    \ operation [125,126]. A common problem in the development of IoT is its asynchronous\
    \ \nheterogeneous data flow and distributed features. This requires the traceability\
    \ system to establish \nuniform and accurate identification naming rules to facilitate\
    \ quick and unique retrieval of \ninformation on a farm product [127]. As the\
    \ deployment of IoT infrastructure is completed, the \nsupply chain will move\
    \ towards virtualization which is no longer required physical contact. The \n\
    virtualization of an agri-food supply chain helps administrators better monitor,\
    \ control, plan and \noptimize food supply chain processes [128]. Wang et al.\
    \ proposed a food safety pre-warning system \nbased on association rules mining\
    \ and IoT. It included four modules: information source, warning \nFigure 6. Schematic\
    \ representation of the Agri-food supply chain from the grower to consumer.\n\
    In past years, a lot of countries have established the traceability platform for\
    \ meat, milk, ﬁsh and\nagri-food products based on IoT [119–121]. However, the\
    \ fresh food cold chain logistics traceability\nhas also drawn widespread attention\
    \ [122,123]. RFID technology still played an important role in\nAgri-food supply\
    \ chain traceability due to its small size and low cost [124]. As a novel technology,\n\
    near ﬁeld communication (NFC) has been progressively developed and used because\
    \ of its safe\nand simple operation [125,126]. A common problem in the development\
    \ of IoT is its asynchronous\nheterogeneous data ﬂow and distributed features.\
    \ This requires the traceability system to establish\nuniform and accurate identiﬁcation\
    \ naming rules to facilitate quick and unique retrieval of information\non a farm\
    \ product [127]. As the deployment of IoT infrastructure is completed, the supply\
    \ chain will\nmove towards virtualization which is no longer required physical\
    \ contact. The virtualization of an\nagri-food supply chain helps administrators\
    \ better monitor, control, plan and optimize food supply\nchain processes [128].\
    \ Wang et al. proposed a food safety pre-warning system based on association\n\
    rules mining and IoT. It included four modules: information source, warning analysis,\
    \ reaction and\nemergency feedback. First, they accessed food critical information\
    \ through data processing and\nanalysis of food traceability data for safety assessment.\
    \ On this basis of this data, the system used the\nassociated data mining method\
    \ to discover the connection between them and then obtained the food\nsafety risk\
    \ analysis results. Subsequently, the system made a corresponding early warning\
    \ response\nbased on this result [129].\nRecently, the increasing incidents of\
    \ food falsiﬁcation have not only brought about great economic\nlosses, but also\
    \ undermined consumers’ conﬁdence in food safety. The blockchain technology with\n\
    decentralization, non-tamperability, development transparency and machine autonomy\
    \ features\nbrings new solutions to the above problems [130,131]. Tian et al.\
    \ reported a new decentralized\ntraceability system based on IoT and blockchain\
    \ technology, which can provid an open, transparent,\nneutral, safe and reliable\
    \ information platform for producers, governments, consumers and other\nstakeholders\
    \ [132]. Kaijun et al. combined the supply chain and blockchain technology to\
    \ propose\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n14 of 24\na double chain architecture agricultural\
    \ traceability system by studying the dual chain structure and\nits storage mode,\
    \ resource rent-seeking and matching mechanism and consensus algorithm [133].\n\
    Now, with the innovation and maturity of related technologies, it is not diﬃcult\
    \ for researchers to\ndevelop a complete set of traceability systems. The rise\
    \ of artiﬁcial intelligence technology enables\nexisting traceability systems\
    \ to provide automation, intelligence and human services to businesses\nand consumers.\
    \ Chen et al. adopted fuzzy cognitive maps and fuzzy rule method to come up with\n\
    an autonomous tracing system for backward design in food supply chain based on\
    \ IoT, which better\ntraced food product problems [134]. However, there are still\
    \ some problems in food safety traceability.\nIt is worth noting that the current\
    \ agricultural product safety traceability system only focuses on\na certain level\
    \ of supply chain or a certain type of goods. With the participation of multiple\
    \ projects\nor multiple sessions, we believe that the focus of future research\
    \ should be on more complex and\nsystematic supply chains.\n5. Disscussion\n5.1.\
    \ Hardware and Software Challenges\nWhen IoT technology is applying in protected\
    \ agriculture, it is inevitable to encounter challenges\nfrom all aspects. In\
    \ the perception layer, various devices must face the harsh and complex greenhouse\n\
    environment. Strong solar radiation, high temperatures, high humidity, strong\
    \ vibrations and other\nhazards can easily damage or destroy sensors or end devices.\
    \ Moreover, the daily activities of livestock\ncan interfere with the work of\
    \ the sensor or execution nodes, resulting in poor detection and control.\nIn\
    \ a general way, the information collection nodes rely on the battery with limited\
    \ power to maintain\nits work because the behavior of frequent battery replacement\
    \ consume a lot of energies and money.\nTherefore, it is an urgent need to make\
    \ great progress in developing low-power acquisition equipment,\nenergy-saving\
    \ sink node routing protocols and energy-balanced communication algorithms [135].\n\
    The devices places in various places generate incalculable data and the storage\
    \ of such data\nis also a huge challenge for some small servers.\nThose agricultural\
    \ IoT data have real-time,\ndynamic, granular and fragmented characteristics,\
    \ which brings great challenges to intermediate\ndesign, data large-scale screening,\
    \ screening, mining, processing and decision analysis techniques.\nMoreover, existing\
    \ databases cannot store unstructured data such as audio, video and images. As\
    \ a result,\nquite a lot real-time sensing data are not fully exploited. Besides,\
    \ some models and algorithms are not\nenough to to reﬂect objective reality, so\
    \ that they cannot eﬀectively guide agricultural production.\n5.2. Network Challenge\n\
    In protected agriculture, the sensor and device need to continuously operate under\
    \ the harsh\nand varied environment and their arrangement is sparse and irregular.\
    \ Compared with the wired\nnetwork with high wiring costs, the wireless network\
    \ has the advantages of low cost, good networking\nﬂexibility and high scalability\
    \ and therefore becomes the main application mode of the current\nmonitoring system.\
    \ Many actual deployments have displayed that common wireless communication\n\
    technologies are aﬀected by temperature, humidity andbuildings or other spatial\
    \ barriers [136–138].\nThe growth of animals and plants changes also result in\
    \ background noise [139] because of the\nmulti-path propagation eﬀects, which\
    \ lows reliability of data transmission. It is easy to isolate a node in\nthe\
    \ original communication network due to low node deployment density and the above\
    \ obstacles in\nprotected agriculture. If this node is responsible for communication\
    \ routing tasks of many devices and\nthis node is damaged and isolated from the\
    \ network, this will cause partial or even paralysis of most of\nthe network.\
    \ Most relevant theories and research needes on the eﬀects of the crop growth,\
    \ the thickness\nand material of wall, and the radio signal transmission loss\
    \ and electromagnetic wave transmission\nbetween soil and air interface, etc.\
    \ To determine the optimal position, height and network topology\nof sensor nodes\
    \ under diﬀerent environmental conditions. On the other hand, ad hoc intelligent\n\
    wireless network technology is needed to reduce or avoid paralysis of large-area\
    \ networks. The rise of\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n15 of 24\nLPWAN may solve e above\
    \ paralysis problems of WLAN due to its long communication distance,\nwhich obviates\
    \ the need for the dense and expensive deployments of relays and gateways altogether.\n\
    However, the cost of erecting LPWAN base stations is high.\nThe process of recording\
    \ various agricultural products’ status from the ﬁeld to the table\ngenerates\
    \ a large amount of data, which brings great challenges to wireless communication\
    \ with\na low transmission rate. At same times, it also brought network nodes\
    \ many problems in energy\ndistribution, data calculation, storage and communication.\
    \ Therefore, there is an urgent need to\ndevelop high-capacity data and real-time\
    \ broadband communication standards for technologies in\ncomplex agricultural\
    \ application environments.\n5.3. Security Challenge\nThe problems of security\
    \ and privacy are thought as crucial challenges in applications of protected\n\
    agriculture due to real-world examples of losses due to vulnerabilities, network\
    \ attacks or privacy issues.\nAs a multi-network heterogeneous converged network,\
    \ it not only has the same security problems as\nsensor networks, mobile communication\
    \ networks and the Interne, but also has its particular issues\nsuch as privacy\
    \ protection issues, authentication and access control issues for heterogeneous\
    \ networks,\nstorage and management of information issues, etc.\nIn the perception\
    \ layer, security threats are mainly against the WSN and RFID. In agricultural\n\
    applications, many of the sensor nodes are deployed in the long-term unsupervised\
    \ farmland\nenvironment and the wireless network itself is open, so the wireless\
    \ transmission is vulnerable to\nexternal interference and illegal users. Coupled\
    \ with the fact that these devices are respectively\nplaced elsewhere, a single\
    \ security measure is not enough [140]. The main threats to WSN include\neavesdropping\
    \ attack, node capture, replay attack and information wiretapping. So multiple\
    \ security\nmechanisms such as anonymity mechanism, data encryption and identity\
    \ authentication mechanisms\nare necessary [141,142].\nThe security threat of\
    \ RFID refers mainly to the attacks that are encountered when the RFID\nreader\
    \ and the tag communicate and such attacks usually lead to user privacy. In addition,\
    \ because the\nRFID tag is rewritable, the security and validity of the RFID tag\
    \ data will not be guaranteed.\nThere are lots of ways to enhance RFID tag security\
    \ such as modifying tag frequency, enciphered data.\nSensor nodes are diﬀerent\
    \ from RFID tag because they are active and relate to the dynamic properties of\n\
    things. Therefore, when applying encryption algorithms, key distribution policies,\
    \ intrusion detection\nmechanisms and security routing policies in speciﬁc devices,\
    \ we need to consider the limitations of\ntheir own hardware.\nSince networks\
    \ of diﬀerent architectures need to be connected to each other, there are even\n\
    greater challenges in terms of security authentication across network architectures.\
    \ The transport\nlayer will encounter the following security challenges: proxy\
    \ attacks, DoS (Denial-of-Service) attacks,\nmalicious code injection, man-in-the-middle\
    \ attacks, attacks across heterogeneous networks, etc.\nThe common measures dealt\
    \ with these network layer threats and attacks are: authorization,\nauthentication,\
    \ encryption, anti-virus protection, etc. IoT terminal devices in protected agriculture\n\
    have the characteristics of weak computing power and small storage space. Due\
    \ to limited resources,\nIoT encryption technology must be an easy to implement,\
    \ lightweight security technology that is\nsuitable for use in sensitive information\
    \ environments [143,144].\nWhen massive agricultural data is transmitted to the\
    \ application layer, in addition to the intelligent\nprocessing of data, data\
    \ security and privacy should also be considered. At this level, a large amount\n\
    of private data about users is collected, such as the consumption of agricultural\
    \ materials, the purchase\ninformation of fruits and vegetables and the location\
    \ of agricultural machinery. Therefore, the database\naccess control strategy\
    \ should be strengthened on the basis of intelligent data processing. When diﬀerent\n\
    users access the same data, they should limit their permissions and operations\
    \ according to their security\nlevel or identity, eﬀectively ensuring data security\
    \ and privacy. On the other hand, application layer\nservice providers should\
    \ accelerate the development and upgrade of authentication mechanisms\nSensors\
    \ 2019, 19, 1833\n16 of 24\nand encryption mechanisms for application scenarios\
    \ such as agricultural production, processing,\ntransportation and consumption.\n\
    5.4. Other Challenges\nThere are other challenges that need to be addressed, which\
    \ are related to the further application of\nIoT technology in protected agriculture.\
    \ Thousands of devices which have huge diﬀerences in processor,\nmemory, communication\
    \ protocol and programming language are deployed in protected agriculture,\nwhich\
    \ inevitably results in heterogeneity issues. Besides, most of devices in protected\
    \ agriculture are\nconnected to the cloud or others by the non-standard heterogeneous\
    \ interfaces [14,22]. This has led\nto problems of both device heterogeneity and\
    \ data heterogeneity. The device heterogeneity problem\naﬀects the scalability\
    \ of IoT in protected agriculture and the data heterogeneity problem hinders the\n\
    use of fusion information by models [145]. Although many research institutes,\
    \ hardware and software\nmanufacturers and related organizations have made a lot\
    \ of contributions to the standardization and\ndeployment of IoT in agriculture,\
    \ it still needs to establish a complete and clear structure, protocols and\n\
    standards to connect various heterogeneous devices and services [146,147].\nThe\
    \ cost has always been a barrier to the large-scale application of IoT to ordinary\
    \ farmers,\nespecially in developing countries like China and India. Despite a\
    \ large number of embedded devices\nand platforms have emerged and the cost of\
    \ hardware and software is rapidly decreasing, but here is\nanother situation\
    \ in high-quality and high-precision sensors and devices. Moreover, some funds\
    \ are\nneeded to train farmers to become proﬁcient in the use of IoT equipment.\
    \ In order to be able toplay\na better role in the future, the cost of sensing,\
    \ transmission, analysis and application components and\nequipment on the IoT\
    \ need to further reduce in order to lower the price and make it more aﬀordable\n\
    in the next decade [148]. Government departments should recognize the signiﬁcant\
    \ potential for the\ndevelopment of IoT in protected agriculture and increase\
    \ investment and support through policies and\nfunds to attract more capital and\
    \ achieve rapid development and application.\nIn addition, the usability of the\
    \ terminal device needs to be further improved, for example, the user\ninterface\
    \ needs to be friendlier andthe device needs to be more convenient in size and\
    \ easy to carry.\nIoT brings many beneﬁts to ecological environment and brings\
    \ some problems.. More and\nmore equipment is being placed in agriculture andso\
    \ the issues of environmental friendliness should\nreceive some attention in the\
    \ future. As the e-waste generated by IoT devices and the consumption of\nenergy\
    \ are gradually increasing, the sustainable development of the ecological environment\
    \ is also one\ncommon concern. Examples of interesting research topics include\
    \ the use of degradable materials and\nrenewable energy sources, the reduction\
    \ of equipment size and the use of energy-saving algorithms\nand new green ICT\
    \ technology [149,150].\nThe application of the Internet of Things in facility\
    \ agriculture needs to consider the socio-economic\nconsequences. On the one hand,\
    \ it increases the level of intelligence in agricultural monitoring,\ncontrol\
    \ and decision-making, thereby increasing the eﬃciency and quality of agricultural\
    \ production.\nAt the same time, it will also change the demand for the existing\
    \ agricultural workforce, causing some\npeople who are engaged in simple repetitive\
    \ tasks to lose their jobs, which will cause a series of\nsocial problems.\n5.5.\
    \ Future Prospects\nIoT technology is being applied to many ﬁelds of society,\
    \ economy and life at an unprecedented\nspeed, making human society step into\
    \ a new era of high intelligence. IoT technology is evolving\nand mature, and\
    \ many novel deployments and applications are constantly being built in protected\n\
    agriculture. Based on the above analysis and discussion of the key technologies\
    \ and applications of IoT\nin the protection of agriculture, we will present its\
    \ future development prospects and key research and\ndevelopment directions in\
    \ the following aspects. In the perception layer, the development of sensors\n\
    should focus on new sensitive materials, mechanisms, processes and methodologies\
    \ as well as low\npower consumption and low cost. Besides, we must accelerate\
    \ the development of sensors and rapid\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n17 of 24\ndetection\
    \ devices soil, animal and plant life. At the network layer, we should focus on\
    \ high-capacity data\nreal-time broadband communication standards and technologies\
    \ for complex agricultural application\nenvironments, high-reliability, adaptive,\
    \ low-power network deployment and management strategies\nand algorithms. With\
    \ wide coverage, high capacity, low power consumption and low cost, LPWAN is\n\
    ideal for some agricultural scenarios where text-based, video and voice service\
    \ support is not required\nand coverage, power consumption and cost are critical.\
    \ Future research and deployment should\nfocus on IoT solutions based on LPWAN.\
    \ In the application layer, governments and organizations\nshould develop uniﬁed\
    \ standards for the sensors and identiﬁcation interface devices, data transmission\n\
    communication protocols, multi-source data fusion analysis processing and application\
    \ services in\nprotected agriculture through international cooperation or negotiation.\
    \ Software developers should\ndevelop large open source databases and signal processing\
    \ algorithm libraries for diﬀerent areas\nof facility agriculture. For universities\
    \ and research institutes, cloud-based agricultural intelligent\ndecision-making\
    \ models, multi-source data-based information fusion algorithms, agricultural\
    \ Big Data\nmining technologies, distributed intelligent processing systems and\
    \ lightweight IoT authentication,\nencryption and authorization mechanisms will\
    \ be the key research directions for the future. With an\nincreased presence of\
    \ IoT technology in protected agriculture, its potential for the reﬁned management\n\
    of crop, livestock and aquatic animals will be recognized. Besides, as a technical\
    \ means to monitor\nthe production, processing, circulation and consumption of\
    \ agricultural products, IoTwill play an\nincreasingly important role in food\
    \ safety.\n6. Conclusions\nIn this survey, we present a comprehensive review of\
    \ the state-of-the-art in IoT deployment\nfor protected agriculture applications.\
    \ First, a simple review of previous IoT structure was given.\nSecondly, the basic\
    \ IoT architectures in protected agriculture were introduced. Next, discussions\
    \ of\nsensor, data communication, cloud computing, edge computing, ML and other\
    \ vital IoT technologies\nin protected agriculture are elaborated.\nThen, we highlight\
    \ various IoT applications and their\npotential to solve various farming problems\
    \ in protected agriculture. By classifying the research and\ndeployment literature\
    \ on IoT in protected agriculture, three important application ﬁelds were given:\n\
    plant management, animal farming and agri-food supply chain traceability. Finally,\
    \ a detailed analyses\nof IoT research challenges and future prospects were outlined.\n\
    The survey of the existing works directs us concluding remarks. The future prospects\
    \ of IoT in\nprotected agriculture are expectant, but the challenges mentioned\
    \ above must handle. In order to\ncope with its complex and changing agricultural\
    \ environment, the hardware devices must be fully\nupgraded to further enhance\
    \ their universality, reliability, expansibility, endurance and intelligence\n\
    level, while reducing costs and operative diﬃculty. Secondly, the local network\
    \ must be protected from\ninterference from other networks. In addition, the interoperability,\
    \ ﬁltering and semantic annotation of\ndata generated by the various devices of\
    \ IoT must be realized to a certain extent. Only in this way\ncan we optimize\
    \ the Big Data decision support model by using a large amount of heterogeneous\
    \ data.\nSecurity, anonymity and control over the access rights on the information\
    \ is vital for such a system to\nbe adopted. Finally, the impact of IoT on the\
    \ agroecological environment and social economy should\nbe considered in the application\
    \ of protected agriculture, to realize the sustainable development of\nagricultural\
    \ environment as quick as possible.\nAuthor Contributions: The collection, classiﬁcation\

    \ is the largest consumptive user of fresh water. Water scarcity\nis increasing\
    \ worldwide, resulting in tighter regulation of its use for agriculture. This\
    \ necessitates the\ndevelopment of irrigation practices that are more efﬁcient\
    \ in the use of water but do not compromise\ncrop quality and yield. Precision\
    \ irrigation already achieves this goal, in part. The goal of precision\nirrigation\
    \ is to accurately supply the crop water need in a timely manner and as spatially\
    \ uniformly\nas possible. However, to maximize the beneﬁts of precision irrigation,\
    \ additional technologies need\nto be enabled and incorporated into agriculture.\
    \ This paper discusses how incorporating adaptive\ndecision support systems into\
    \ precision irrigation management will enable signiﬁcant advances in\nincreasing\
    \ the efﬁciency of current irrigation approaches. From the literature review,\
    \ it is found that\nprecision irrigation can be applied in achieving the environmental\
    \ goals related to sustainability.\nThe demonstrated economic beneﬁts of precision\
    \ irrigation in ﬁeld-scale crop production is however\nminimal. It is argued that\
    \ a proper combination of soil, plant and weather sensors providing\nreal-time\
    \ data to an adaptive decision support system provides an innovative platform\
    \ for improving\nsustainability in irrigated agriculture. The review also shows\
    \ that adaptive decision support systems\nbased on model predictive control are\
    \ able to adequately account for the time-varying nature of the\nsoil–plant–atmosphere\
    \ system while considering operational limitations and agronomic objectives\n\
    in arriving at optimal irrigation decisions. It is concluded that signiﬁcant improvements\
    \ in crop\nyield and water savings can be achieved by incorporating model predictive\
    \ control into precision\nirrigation decision support tools. Further improvements\
    \ in water savings can also be realized by\nincluding deﬁcit irrigation as part\
    \ of the overall irrigation management strategy. Nevertheless, future\nresearch\
    \ is needed for identifying crop response to regulated water deﬁcits, developing\
    \ improved\nsoil moisture and plant sensors, and developing self-learning crop\
    \ simulation frameworks that can\nbe applied to evaluate adaptive decision support\
    \ strategies related to irrigation.\nKeywords: precision irrigation; adaptive\
    \ decision support systems; model predictive control;\ncrop yield; water savings;\
    \ sustainability\n1. Introduction\nGlobally, 70% of water use is applied in irrigation\
    \ of crops, making irrigation the largest\nconsumptive user of fresh water [1].\
    \ Over 80% of freshwater withdrawals in developing countries is\napplied in irrigation\
    \ [2]. Irrigated agriculture provides 40% of the world’s food from less than 20%\
    \ of\nthe cultivated area highlighting the importance of irrigation in global\
    \ food security [3].\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353; doi:10.3390/su9030353\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability\n\
    Sustainability 2017, 9, 353\n2 of 29\nIrrigated crop production globally extends\
    \ over 275 million hectares, with an estimated annual\nincrease of 1.3% [2]. Global\
    \ climate change may further increase irrigation water demand due to a\ngreater\
    \ variation in annual precipitation amounts [4]. Postel [5] suggested that irrigation\
    \ will provide\n46% of the global crop water requirement by 2025, which was computed\
    \ as 28% in 1995, resulting in a\ndecline of rain-fed agriculture. Food production\
    \ in the developing world, notably in South, Southeast\nand East Asia, is at present\
    \ heavily reliant on irrigation. The total irrigated area in Asia is 230 million\
    \ ha,\nwhich represents over 70% of the global irrigated area. Of the 230 million\
    \ ha of irrigated land area, 60%\nis located in China and India [3]. It is estimated\
    \ that 75% of the grain production in China is dependent\non irrigation [2]. Sarma\
    \ [6] noted that India uses as much as four times more water to produce one\n\
    unit of a major food crop as compared to the USA and Europe. This implies that\
    \ an improvement\nin water use efﬁciency in the developing world would conserve\
    \ at least half of the water presently\napplied in irrigation.\nIt is estimated\
    \ that a water volume of 2630 km3 is abstracted yearly from surface and ground\n\
    water sources for irrigated crop production. The absence of surface water sources\
    \ in a number of\ncommunities has further increased the pressure on groundwater\
    \ resources. This has resulted in the\nover-abstraction of global groundwater\
    \ sources which is calculated to be as much as 163 km3 per\nannum [2]. A global\
    \ shortage in freshwater sources is predicted unless action is taken to improve\
    \ water\nmanagement and increase water use efﬁciency. This has necessitated greater\
    \ regulatory demands for\nenvironmental protection of freshwater [7]. It is reported\
    \ that only half of the total freshwater volume\nabstracted for irrigation globally\
    \ reaches the targeted crops [2]. These have brought about the need to\ndevise\
    \ procedures to use the limited water more efﬁciently while maximizing crop yield\
    \ and quality.\nConventional irrigation practice involves applying water uniformly\
    \ over every part of the ﬁeld\nwithout taking into account the spatial variability\
    \ in soil and crop water needs; this consequently leads\nto overirrigation in\
    \ some parts of the ﬁeld while other parts of the ﬁeld are underirrigated [8].\
    \ The risks\nassociated with overirrigation include surface runoff, deep percolation\
    \ and leaching of nitrates and\nnutrients. Those associated with underirrigation\
    \ are more subjective and include reduction in crop\nyields and quality, as well\
    \ as inefﬁcient use of fertilizer and other supplemental inputs for crop\nproduction\
    \ [9].\nThe irrigation process requires a high level of ‘precision’ in order to\
    \ optimize the water input\nand crop response, while minimizing adverse environmental\
    \ impacts. Precision irrigation is an\nevolving ﬁeld with active interest by both\
    \ industry and academic researchers. It is conceptualized by\nsome researchers\
    \ as the use of efﬁcient irrigation application systems, whereas others view it\
    \ as the\nvariable application of irrigation based on predeﬁned maps or sensor\
    \ feedback [10]. Smith et al. [11]\nsuggested that ‘precision’ involves the accurate\
    \ determination, quantiﬁcation of crop water needs and\nthe precise application\
    \ of the optimal water volume at the required time. This implies that varying\n\
    water application spatially is not the sole requirement for the achievement of\
    \ ‘precision’ in the irrigation\nprocess. Hence, precision irrigation can be deﬁned\
    \ as the process of accounting for the ﬁeld-scale\nspatial variability in crop\
    \ water need and applying the right amount of water to match the spatial crop\n\
    water need at the right time [9]. The advantages associated with precision irrigation\
    \ include increased\ncrop yields, improved crop quality, improved water use efﬁciency/savings,\
    \ reduction of energy costs\nand reduction of adverse environmental impacts [12].\
    \ Pierce [13] viewed precision irrigation as a\ntool for improving sustainability\
    \ in irrigated agriculture in terms of improved irrigation water use\nefﬁciency\
    \ and improved environmental quality of irrigated ﬁelds.\nThe balance of several\
    \ core aspects is however important for the successful implementation of\na robust\
    \ precision irrigation system. Implementing a precision irrigation system involves\
    \ efforts on\nreal-time monitoring of crop and soil conditions, scheduling irrigation\
    \ and control of the irrigation\napplication equipment. Research has been mainly\
    \ focused on the sensing and control aspects of\nprecision irrigation with much\
    \ advancements in the last decade [12]. Research is limited, however,\nin the\
    \ development of appropriate irrigation scheduling tools for the precision irrigation\
    \ process [14].\nIrrigation scheduling is the process by which a producer determines\
    \ when to apply irrigation and\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n3 of 29\nthe amount\
    \ of irrigation water to apply [15]. Hornbuckle et al. [16] suggested that the\
    \ irrigation\nscheduling endeavour should be treated as an all-encompassing decision\
    \ support system for irrigation\nmanagement. A robust decision support system\
    \ is important in the successful implementation of\nprecision irrigation. The\
    \ need for a decision support system capable of real-time management decisions\n\
    of when, where and how much to irrigate while also considering uncertainty in\
    \ climatic inputs,\nthe time-varying nature of cropping systems, as well as equipment\
    \ and operational limitations cannot\nbe overemphasized. Rhodig and Hillyer [17]\
    \ noted that the development of an optimal decision support\ntool for precision\
    \ irrigation will involve the combination of appropriate modeling and management\n\
    tools. The decision support tools available for precision irrigation management\
    \ are presently inﬂexible\nand difﬁcult to adapt to varying cropping scenarios\
    \ [18].\nIn recent years, there has been a number of in-depth reviews on precision\
    \ irrigation (e.g., [9,16]),\nand our intention is not to repeat the areas they\
    \ addressed. Rather, our aim is to provide an in-depth\ntechnical analysis of\
    \ the considerations necessary for the development of a practical and robust decision\n\
    support system for precision irrigation in order to improve sustainable irrigated\
    \ agriculture. To that\nend, the review will focus on the following critical aspects\
    \ of precision irrigation: (1) monitoring\nconsiderations; (2) present limitations\
    \ and state of the art in decision support; and (3) opportunities for\nimproving\
    \ sustainability. We will however include brief sections on the concept of spatial\
    \ variability\nand the control of water application in precision irrigation.\n\

    \ underlying argument for precision irrigation is the presence of within-ﬁeld\
    \ spatial variability\nthat inﬂuences crop water demand. The spatial variability\
    \ in crop water demand may have a direct\ninﬂuence on the crop yield, quality\
    \ and the environmental quality of irrigated ﬁelds [19]. The soil water\npresents\
    \ the sole source of water available for direct plant uptake and therefore its\
    \ spatial variability\nwill have a direct inﬂuence on crop water demand. Soil\
    \ and landscape characteristics like soil texture,\ntopography, abiotic and management\
    \ factors (e.g., compaction, tillage) and hydraulic properties vary\nspatially\
    \ across a ﬁeld [11]. These have a direct inﬂuence on the water-holding capacity\
    \ of the soil.\nHedley and Yule [20] reported that the spatial variation in the\
    \ soil water retention characteristics was\nstrongly correlated with the spatial\
    \ variation in soil texture across a ﬁeld, noting that areas with heavier\nsoils\
    \ within a ﬁeld had a larger water-holding capacity in comparison to those with\
    \ light textured\nsoils. The advent of rapid non-invasive technologies for mapping\
    \ soil properties, speciﬁcally electrical\nconductivity mapping, can reveal within-ﬁeld\
    \ variability that can guide in variable rate irrigation\nmanagement. These have\
    \ been successfully applied by Hedley and Yule [21] and Daccache et al. [8].\n\
    Readers are directed to [22,23] for a comprehensive overview of electrical conductivity\
    \ mapping.\nThe variability in yield across a ﬁeld has also been found to be strongly\
    \ correlated with the spatial\nvariability in water available for crop use. The\
    \ spatial variability in crop yield is a function of the\ninterplay between water\
    \ stress, nutrients, in addition to soil’s physical and chemical properties [24].\n\
    The yield map can be correlated with the soil electrical conductivity (EC) map.\
    \ These similarities can be\nexplained through the spatial variability of soil\
    \ properties that exists across a ﬁeld. The water-holding\ncapacity of the soil\
    \ is a major factor affecting yield, and the yield map will likely show a strong\n\
    correlation to soil EC [25]. Irmak et al. [26] noted that the spatial variability\
    \ in soil water retention\ncharacteristics played a dominant role in explaining\
    \ the spatial yield variability observed in soybean.\nMartinez-Casasnovas et al.\
    \ [27] suggested yield mapping as an important tool in variable rate\nirrigation\
    \ management.\nA robust precision irrigation system will be able to meet the spatially\
    \ varying crop water demand\nacross a ﬁeld at the right time. This requires accurate\
    \ knowledge of the within-ﬁeld variability. This\nis addressed by applying the\
    \ concept of irrigation management zones/units in precision irrigation.\nThe irrigation\
    \ management zones are a group of homogeneous units with similar soil water retention\n\
    characteristics [21]. It is however important that these management zones are\
    \ large enough to be\nmanaged individually while remaining relatively homogeneous\
    \ in order to reﬂect the spatial soil\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n4 of 29\n\
    variation across the units. The delineation of irrigation management zones based\
    \ on real-time sensor\ndata has also been demonstrated. This is achieved by applying\
    \ infrared thermometry/thermography\nto assess the spatial variation in crop canopy\
    \ temperature across a ﬁeld [28]. The crop canopy\ntemperature of a healthy transpiring\
    \ crop will often be less than that of the ambient air. When crop\ntranspiration\
    \ is reduced as a result of water deﬁcits, the crop canopy temperature is expected\
    \ to increase.\nThe characterization of crop water status as a function of the\
    \ canopy and ambient temperature is the\nbasis for using infrared thermometry/thermography\
    \ as a mapping tool for precision irrigation [29].\nShaughnessy et al. [30] and\
    \ Evett et al. [31] have successfully applied this procedure in generating\ndynamic\
    \ maps to guide variable rate water application for ﬁeld crops grown under a center\
    \ pivot\nsystem. It should, however, be noted that infrared temperature measurements\
    \ are usually taken over\na short period, mostly at midday when the crop is expected\
    \ to experience the highest evaporative\ndemand. Hence, this method is well suited\
    \ for crop production systems in which the soil moisture\ndynamics has relatively\
    \ long time constants.\n3. Spatial Scales of Irrigation Management\nCentre pivot,\
    \ lateral move and low energy precision application (LEPA) moving machines can\
    \ be\nmodiﬁed to apply spatially variable irrigation [32]. These systems are particularly\
    \ suited to variable\nrate water application because of their current level of\
    \ automation and large coverage area with\na single lateral pipe. Fixed irrigation\
    \ systems also have potential to be deployed for variable rate\nwater application\
    \ as they can be very accurate and can be automated based on sensor feedback [2].\n\
    Implementing a spatially varied irrigation system requires an understanding of\
    \ the characteristics of\nthe irrigation application system deployed including\
    \ the spatial scales covered by the water application\nequipment. The spatial\
    \ scale associated with the variability in crop water requirements and its impact\n\
    on yield should also be identiﬁed [32].\nO’Shaughnessy et al. [33] suggested that\
    \ the size and numbers of irrigation management zones\nthat can be controlled\
    \ in a precision irrigation strategy will determine the overall ﬂexibility of\
    \ the\nsystem. For moving application systems, the width of the management zone\
    \ is dependent on the\nnumber of drops or nozzles within an individually controlled\
    \ set (i.e., sprinklers controlled by a single\nsolenoid valve) and the length\
    \ will be dependent on the pattern of variability in the direction of the\ntraveling\
    \ sprinkler. The wind speed and the overlap from the wetted sprinkler patterns\
    \ between\nmanagement zones will also affect the accuracy of the water volume\
    \ applied. Raine and McCarthy [32]\nnoted that the spray diameter and overlap\
    \ achieved by moving application systems make it impossible\nto target water applications\
    \ on a single crop basis using these systems. Hedley et al. [2] suggested that\n\
    the economic beneﬁts of spatially varied irrigation should be an important consideration\
    \ even when\nthe system is considered achievable from a technical standpoint.\
    \ The spatial scales associated with\nmoving and ﬁxed irrigation systems is presented\
    \ in Table 1. Smith et al. [11] concluded that the spatial\nresolution of a precision\
    \ irrigation system will be inﬂuenced by the spatial scales associated with the\n\
    application system, spatial resolution of the inﬁeld sensors and the spatial scales\
    \ associated with the\nvariability in crop water requirements.\nTable 1. Spatial\

    \ in Precision Irrigation\nThe water application system used in the precision\
    \ irrigation process must be able to control the\nwater application volume applied\
    \ per unit time to each deﬁned irrigation management unit within a\nﬁeld [13].\
    \ The development of variable rate water application systems has been mostly focused\
    \ on\ncontinuous move systems [11].\nThe control of water application on continuous\
    \ move systems (centre pivot, linear move, boom\nand reel) is based on databases\
    \ of spatially referenced data deﬁning irrigation management units [20].\nThe\
    \ volume of water applied to each management unit can be achieved by varying the\
    \ application rate\nof sprinklers or controlling the ground speed of continuous\
    \ move systems [13].\nThe application rate of sprinklers is mostly varied through\
    \ the pulse modulation of the sprinkler\nnozzles. This involves the application\
    \ of normally opened solenoid valves to control ﬂow through\nan individual or\
    \ group of sprinkler heads. The solenoid turns the ﬂow of water either on or off\
    \ at\na sprinkler location in order to achieve a desired application depth within\
    \ a speciﬁed cycle time.\nThe cycle time is the total number of switching (either\
    \ to on or off phase) required by the solenoid\nvalves during a pulse cycle [34].\
    \ Evans et al. [34] applied the pulse modulated sprinkler control\non a linear\
    \ move sprinkler system. Daccache et al. [8] also applied a pulsed modulated sprinkler\n\
    control on a boom and reel irrigation system. Field evaluation of both systems\
    \ indicated a satisfactory\nperformance over a range of water application rates.\
    \ They however noted a problem with sprinkler\noverlap at the edge of the irrigation\
    \ management units.\nThe variation in irrigation volume applied by a continuous\
    \ move system can also be achieved by\nvarying its travel speed. The sprinklers\
    \ on the manifold of the irrigation system are usually operated\nat a speciﬁed\
    \ ﬂow rate and pressure. An increase in travel speed of the system reduces the\
    \ application\ndepth and a decrease in the travel speed increases the application\
    \ depth [35]. This type of system\ncannot be applied in situations where variable\
    \ application depths are needed along the length of the\nirrigation system [34].\
    \ Al-Karadsheh [9] evaluated the performance of speed control in achieving\nvariable\
    \ water application rate on a linear move system. The wetted diameter of the sprinklers\
    \ was\nreported to be between 15.2 and 21.3 m. He reported that the system needed\
    \ to travel a minimum\ndistance of 16 m before a desired change in application\
    \ volume can be reached. This suggests that this\nsystem is not suitable for use\
    \ in applications where the management units are small in scale.\nThe adaptation\
    \ of ﬁxed irrigation systems for variable rate water application has been achieved\n\
    (e.g., [36]). Variable water rate application in these systems is usually achieved\
    \ either by individual\nnozzle or emitter control, or zone management [13]. Readers\
    \ are referred to [13] for a comprehensive\nreview of such systems. Miranda et\
    \ al. [37] described a distributed control system implemented to\nachieve variable\
    \ rate water application in a ﬁxed irrigation system operating in predeﬁned management\n\
    zones. Their results indicated that the system was able to apply the irrigation\
    \ volume required in\neach zone. Goumopoulos et al. [38] also implemented a variable\
    \ rate water application setup for a\nﬁxed irrigation system capable of zone-speciﬁc\
    \ irrigation of strawberries. Individual nozzle control\nin a micro-sprinkler\
    \ system has been demonstrated by Coates et al. [39]. They reported individual\n\
    control of 54 nodes in a vineyard with the system. The nozzle connected to each\
    \ node was capable of\nachieving a unique water application volume. They concluded\
    \ that the water requirements of each\ndeﬁned zone in the vineyard can be individually\
    \ met by the irrigation system. The authors reported a\npayback period of between\
    \ 3.5 and 4.5 years for the system.\n5. Monitoring\nThe routine or continuous\
    \ monitoring of moisture ﬂuxes in the soil–plant–atmosphere system is a\nfundamental\
    \ aspect of managing crop production in irrigated agriculture. Monitoring can\
    \ essentially\nbe viewed as the application of various sensing technologies in\
    \ determining and characterizing\nthe spatiotemporal ﬁeld-scale moisture dynamics\
    \ and plant water use. These sensing methods can\nbe classiﬁed under three broad\
    \ headings: soil-based, weather-based and plant-based sensing [40].\nSoil-based\
    \ sensing typically involves the use of sensors to determine the soil moisture\
    \ content or\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n6 of 29\npotential. This information\
    \ is then used to infer the amount of water available for plant use and\nits temporal\
    \ dynamics. The weather-based sensing involves the use of the crop evapotranspiration\n\
    to determine the temporal crop water use. The evapotranspiration is determined\
    \ using climatic\nvariables such as radiation, rainfall and wind speed [41,42].\
    \ The plant-based sensing involves the\ndetermination of plant water status which\
    \ is usually related to plant physiology. Measurements\nof canopy temperature,\
    \ stomatal resistance, sap ﬂow, leaf turgor pressure, stem diameter and leaf\n\
    thickness are used to infer plant water status [43].\nRecent advances in remote\
    \ sensing has enhanced the possibility of monitoring the spatial nature of\nboth\
    \ soil and crop water status. Remote sensing encompasses non-contact technologies\
    \ that are capable\nof sensing radiation reﬂected or emitted from agricultural\
    \ ﬁelds. They are deployed using satellites,\naerial platforms and tractors [44].\
    \ These technologies have a high spatial resolution and are well suited\nfor regional\
    \ soil and crop water evaluation [45]. This review focuses on sensing technologies\
    \ that can\nbe applied in monitoring ﬁeld-scale soil and crop water dynamics.\
    \ Readers are referred to [44,46] for a\ncomprehensive review of remote sensing\
    \ technologies applicable in precision agriculture.\n5.1. Soil-Based Sensing\n\
    The knowledge of soil moisture ﬂuxes comprising of the depletion and reﬁll of\
    \ soil water can be\nused to monitor crop water use hence making it a useful tool\
    \ in irrigation scheduling and management\ndecisions [47]. Several methods have\
    \ been developed for measuring soil moisture content; they are\nindirect methods\
    \ which rely on the strong relationship between a particular property of the soil\n\
    and the soil moisture content. Moreover, they are able to provide continuous monitoring\
    \ and are\nnon-destructive [48]. In precision irrigation, the commonly applied\
    \ method for monitoring the\ntemporal dynamics of ﬁeld-scale soil moisture is\
    \ the dielectric-based method [20]. This is because\nof the ease of their deployment\
    \ in large-scale soil moisture sensor networks [49]. Thus, the proper\ndeployment\
    \ and management of this technology can optimize the sustainability of irrigated\
    \ agriculture.\nConsequently, this section will outline a brief description of\
    \ this method including a consideration of\nthe factors affecting sensor performance.\
    \ For a more detailed description of other state-of-the-art soil\nmoisture sensing\
    \ technologies, readers are referred to [50,51].\n5.1.1. Dielectric Soil Moisture\
    \ Sensors\nDielectric soil moisture sensors operate by exploiting the dielectric\
    \ properties of soil and its\nconstituents [52]. The relative dielectric permittivity\
    \ of a substance is used to describe the effect of\nan electromagnetic ﬁeld on\
    \ its molecular structure. It is a dimensionless constant greater than one,\n\
    made up of a real and imaginary part [53]. The apparent relative dielectric permittivity\
    \ of soil, ε′soil\nis a function of its constituents majorly being water, air\
    \ and solid particles. The relative dielectric\npermittivity of the other constituents\
    \ except water has a negligible effect as they have small values in\nthe range\
    \ of 1–7. The one of water, ε′water having a value of approximately 80 has the\
    \ most remarkable\neffect. It is therefore possible to correlate the volumetric\
    \ moisture content (VMC) to ε′soil using\nempirical equations at a frequency range\
    \ of between 50 MHz and 17 GHz. At this high frequency\nrange, ε′soil is highly\
    \ stable and it usually referred to as the apparent dielectric permittivity of\
    \ soil [54].\nA range of electromagnetic sensors exploits this property to provide\
    \ a non-destructive in situ\nmeasurement of soil moisture contents. They include\
    \ time domain reﬂectometry (TDR) sensors, time\ndomain transmission (TDT) sensors\
    \ and capacitance sensors.\n5.1.2. Factors Affecting the Performance of Dielectric\
    \ Soil Moisture Sensors\nThe accuracy of data from soil moisture sensors is important\
    \ in the precision irrigation process.\nOver estimation of soil moisture status\
    \ may lead to a delay in irrigation scheduling decisions and\nconsequently affect\
    \ crop yield and quality. Underestimation of soil moisture status on the other\
    \ hand\nmay lead to application of irrigation too often or when not required by\
    \ the crops. This will result in\nwater/energy wastage and adverse environmental\
    \ effects.\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n7 of 29\nDielectric soil moisture sensors\
    \ measure the soil moisture content for the soil volume\ncorresponding to their\
    \ sphere of inﬂuence. The various factors affecting the performance of dielectric\n\
    soil moisture sensors include bulk electrical conductivity (salinity), soil texture,\
    \ bulk density and\ntemperature. A variation in any of these factors around the\
    \ sphere of inﬂuence of the dielectric sensor\nwill have an effect on its performance.\
    \ These properties vary with location and depth in a soil proﬁle\nand it is important\
    \ to take them into account when calibrating dielectric soil moisture sensors\
    \ [55].\nThese sensors often rely on site-speciﬁc calibration, but they often\
    \ come with ‘universal’ calibrations\nwhich can be used where absolute accuracy\
    \ is not required. The accuracy of calibration equations\nsupplied by manufacturers\
    \ of these sensors are usually between a range of ±4 - 2% VMC when applied\nin\
    \ non-saline soils [56]. Site-speciﬁc calibration equations which are developed\
    \ by comparing the\nsensor output to gravimetrically derived soil moisture content\
    \ can be applied when a higher level of\naccuracy is required [57]. In addition,\
    \ for capacitance type probes, it is essential that the probe access\ntubes are\
    \ ﬁtted correctly without air gaps to ensure robust soil water measurements. For\
    \ a detailed\ntechnical description of factors affecting the performance of dielectric\
    \ sensors, readers are referred\nto [58,59].\n5.2. Proximal Sensing and Mapping\
    \ of Soil Moisture\nThe recent advances in rapid mapping and positioning technologies\
    \ enables the spatial\ncharacterization of soil moisture retention properties\
    \ to inform precision irrigation decisions.\nThe electromagnetic induction (EM)\
    \ technique is used in combination with accurate positioning\nsystems to quantify\
    \ soil moisture variability at resolutions less than 10 m. It also provides a\
    \ highly\naccurate digital elevation map (DEM) [2].\nThe EM sensor maps the soil’s\
    \ apparent EC which is inﬂuenced by soil texture and moisture in\nnon-saline soils\
    \ [48]. Those same factors correlate highly to the soil’s water-holding capacity.\
    \ Based on\nthe EC maps, a targeted soil sampling can be conducted at different\
    \ parts of the ﬁeld. Topographic\nfeatures that are likely to inﬂuence ﬁeld-scale\
    \ soil moisture dynamics are derived using the DEM [60].\nThe EC maps enable the\
    \ grouping of discrete units known as management units with similar\navailable\
    \ water-holding capacity (AWC) characteristics which can then be used in selecting\
    \ soil\nmoisture monitoring sites. This has been demonstrated by [34,61]. The\
    \ data from soil moisture sensors\nlocated in the management units can also be\
    \ used in generating dynamic application maps based\non a relationship between\
    \ the soil moisture depletion and the mapped EC values. These application\nmaps\
    \ serve as an input into the precision irrigation control system. Hedley and Yule\
    \ [21] applied soil\nmoisture sensors and an EC map in generating dynamic water\
    \ status maps for a 35.2 ha irrigated\nmaize ﬁeld. Daccache et al. [8] applied\
    \ a similar method in producing dynamic soil moisture maps for\nvarious ﬁelds.\n\
    The electric resistivity tomography technique can also be applied in deriving\
    \ the EC map of a ﬁeld.\nHedley et al. [2] reported that the method has a good\
    \ vertical resolution but it cannot be deployed on a\nmoving platform for rapid\
    \ non-invasive mapping. It has been applied by Kelly et al. [62] in positioning\n\
    soil moisture sensors to support irrigation decisions.\nThe ground-penetrating\
    \ radar (GPR) can also be applied in monitoring the ﬁeld-scale soil moisture\n\
    status [50]. It can be mounted on a vehicle or moving irrigation system for mapping\
    \ soil moisture in a\nﬁeld. The GPR is however affected by high clay content,\
    \ is not amenable to automation and requires\nfurther development to improve its\
    \ viability in precision irrigation applications [63].\nThe deployment of soil\
    \ moisture sensors in management units defined by these mapping techniques\nenables\
    \ the dynamic updates of soil moisture maps which can aid variable rate water\
    \ application.\n5.3. Weather-Based Sensing\nWeather-based sensing involves the\
    \ use of climatic variables in determining ET which is indicative\nof the crops’\
    \ daily water use. Evaporation accounts for the direct evaporation of water to\
    \ the air from\nthe soil surface or canopy interception of either precipitation\
    \ or applied irrigation. Transpiration\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n8 of 29\n\
    accounts for the uptake of water by a plant and the subsequent loss of water as\
    \ vapor through stomata\nin its leaves, required for metabolic cooling of the\
    \ leaf to maintain photosynthesis without the leaf\noverheating [41]. Evapotranspiration\
    \ is generally viewed as a combination of the evaporation of water\nfrom the soil,\
    \ evaporation from the canopy surface and plant transpiration [64].\nThe evaporation\
    \ and transpiration process occur simultaneously and are often difﬁcult to\ndistinguish.\
    \ The predominance of each of these processes however varies at different crop\
    \ growth\nstages. At the initial crop growth stage, water is lost mainly in form\
    \ of evaporation from the soil\nsurface. As the development of the crop progresses,\
    \ transpiration becomes the major medium of water\nloss to the atmosphere [45].\n\
    The ET process is largely dependent on solar radiation, vapor pressure deﬁcit\
    \ of the atmosphere\nat any given time and wind speed. It is also inﬂuenced by\
    \ soil water content, the rate at which water\ncan be taken up from the soil by\
    \ the plant roots and crop characteristics (type, variety and growth\nstage) [64].\
    \ Readers are directed to [41,65] for a further discussion on the ET process.\n\
    The temporal dynamics of evapotranspiration on hourly or daily timescales is appropriate\n\
    for quantifying crop water use in the precision irrigation process. The United\
    \ Nations Food and\nAgriculture Organization Penman–Monteith (FAO-PM) equation\
    \ presents a procedure for computing\nhourly or daily ET values using standard\
    \ climatological measurements of solar radiation, air\ntemperature, humidity and\
    \ wind speed made at a height of 2 m above a fully transpiring grass\nsurface\
    \ [41]. These data can be obtained from automatic weather stations installed on\
    \ a speciﬁc ﬁeld or\nfrom a metrological network. The equation provides a basis\
    \ from which reference ET (ET from the\nwell-watered grass surface) for different\
    \ time periods can be calculated and to which ET from other\ncrops can be computed\
    \ using crop coefﬁcients, Kc [66]. The crop coefﬁcients are speciﬁc to each crop\n\
    and crop canopy cover, which is dependent on the crop growth stage. The Kc curve\
    \ deﬁned for a crop\nover its growth stage is generalized for regions with similar\
    \ climates. The Kc is however dependent on\nthe canopy dynamics including cover\
    \ fraction, leaf area index and greenness which may vary across\nregions with\
    \ similar climates [67]. This introduces errors into ET estimates derived using\
    \ the standard\nFAO-PM crop coefﬁcient approach. The FAO-PM method presents a\
    \ relatively easy procedure for\ndetermining the temporal dynamics of crop water\
    \ use. The crop coefﬁcient used in determining the\nactual ET of a particular\
    \ crop however needs to be estimated at each growth stage. It is noted in\nAllen\
    \ et al. [41] that reference ET can be overestimated by as much as 20% during\
    \ conditions of low\nevaporative demand.\nRemote sensing provides a means of overcoming\
    \ the shortcomings of the FAO-PM crop coefﬁcient\napproach of estimating crop\
    \ ET by providing real-time feedback on daily crop water use as inﬂuenced\nby\
    \ actual crop canopy dynamics, local climatic conditions and ﬁeld spatial variability\
    \ [68]. The remotely\nsensed normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) computed\
    \ from crop canopy reﬂectance\nmeasurements in the red and near-infrared (NIR)\
    \ wavelengths has been found to be a useful tool in\ncomputing accurate crop coefﬁcients\
    \ for a broad range of crops [69]. Singh et al. [70] has demonstrated\nthe use\
    \ of the calculated reference ET and the remotely sensed NDVI in estimating the\
    \ water use of\ncotton. A similar procedure has also been demonstrated by Farg\
    \ et al. [67] for estimating the daily\nwater use of wheat.\nThe surface renewal\
    \ analysis method presents an opportunity for assessing the real-time temporal\n\
    dynamics of crop water use. The surface renewal (SR) method is used to determine\
    \ the sensible heat\nwhich can then be applied to the energy balance equation\
    \ to determine the latent heat (i.e., ET) [71]. It is\nbased on analyzing the\
    \ temperature time series generated from monitoring the change in heat content\n\
    of air parcels that interact with the crop canopy. When an air parcel comes in\
    \ contact with the crop\ncanopy, the air temperature remains constant for a brief\
    \ time period known as the quiescent period.\nThe temperature of the air parcel\
    \ however increases after this time period as energy is transferred\nto it from\
    \ the crop canopy. The increase in temperature continues until the air parcel\
    \ is replaced by\ncooler air from the atmosphere. At this time, the temperature\
    \ of the air shows a sharp drop [72].\nA high frequency trace of this temperature\
    \ renewal event exhibits a ramp-like function. Applying\nSustainability 2017,\
    \ 9, 353\n9 of 29\nstructure function theory to the ramp function enables the\
    \ determination of the sensible heat ﬂux.\nThe instrumentation requirement for\
    \ an SR system is minimal, consisting of small diameter ﬁne wire\nthermocouples\
    \ or a two-dimensional sonic anemometer and a high frequency data acquisition\
    \ system\n(2 Hz to 10 Hz) [71]. Standard climatological measurements are also\
    \ required to obtain the other\nparameters in the energy balance equation.\nThe\
    \ SR technique requires that measurements are taken at a minimum height above\
    \ the crop\ncanopy. It is assumed that the canopy is homogeneous and able to absorb\
    \ all the momentum transferred\nto it by the ambient airﬂow [73]. This assumption\
    \ introduces errors in ET estimates over ﬁelds\nwith variable canopy structures.\
    \ Castellvi and Snyder [74] concluded that the technique can be\napplied for estimating\
    \ ET from short and dense canopy crops as they are mostly decoupled from\nthe\
    \ environment. The technique also requires calibration using an eddy covariance\
    \ system or a\nlysimeter. This may limit its practicality for farm-scale deployment.\
    \ The SR methodology proposed by\nCastellvi [75], however, does not require calibration.\
    \ Rosa and Tanny [76], Shapland and Snyder [72],\nand Rosa et al. [77] have reported\

    \ analysis system.\n5.4. Plant-Based Sensing\nThe importance of plant-based monitoring\
    \ becomes emphasized when studying the effect of\nwater deﬁcit on plants and its\
    \ relation to plant water status. The temporal dynamics of crop water use\ncan\
    \ be monitored using a number of plant-based methods. They include methods that\
    \ require direct\ncontact with the plant and those that require only proximal\
    \ contact with the plants [78]. The contact\nsensors are useful in monitoring\
    \ the temporal dynamics of the plant water status while the proximal\nsensors\
    \ are capable of assessing the spatial nature of crop water status across a ﬁeld\
    \ and hence\nwell suited for the precision irrigation process [11]. A good understanding\
    \ of the various aspects of\nplant water status and plant drought physiology is\
    \ important in the successful application of these\nsystems. Readers are directed\
    \ to [79,80] for a comprehensive overview of plant-based sensing methods\napplicable\
    \ in irrigation management. Plant-based sensing systems measure either the plant\
    \ water\ncontent, plant water potential or the plant physiological response to\
    \ moisture deﬁcits. A summary of\nvarious plant-based sensing systems is given\
    \ in Table 2. It should be noted that many of these require\nskilled manpower\
    \ and considerable management time for their operation.\nTable 2. Summary of plant-based\

    10 of 29\n5.5. Thermal Sensing\nPlant canopy temperature is a widely accepted\
    \ variable indicative of plant water status.\nThe stomata controls evaporative\
    \ cooling of the leaves based on soil water status and prevailing\nenvironmental\
    \ conditions.\nIt closes due to increased water deﬁcits and a reduction in plant\n\
    transpiration causing an increase in plant canopy temperature [91]. The measurement\
    \ of the crop\ncanopy temperature by infrared thermometry which is then normalized\
    \ using an index such as the\ncrop water stress index (CWSI) can be used in determining\
    \ the plant water status and its response to\nwater deﬁcits [79].\nThe CWSI is\
    \ a well-established method of accounting for the variation in canopy temperature\
    \ as\na function of prevailing microclimatological conditions and water deﬁcits\
    \ [92]. It relates the difference\nin the crop canopy temperature measured using\
    \ infrared thermometry to the air temperature as a\nfunction of atmospheric vapor\
    \ deﬁcit [93]. This temperature difference is then related to an upper\nand lower\
    \ temperature baseline to determine a water stress index. The upper baseline represents\n\
    a non-transpiring crop and the lower baseline represents a fully transpiring crop\
    \ under the same\nprevailing environmental condition [30]. The CWSI is a dimensionless\
    \ value of between 0 and 1, with a\nvalue of 0 indicating a well-watered crop\
    \ and a value of 1 indicating a severely water-stressed crop [93].\nBiotic factors\
    \ can also induce stress in a plant thus affecting transpiration rate, crop water\
    \ use and\ncanopy temperature. These biotic factors also affect leaf colour and\
    \ morphology which in turn affects\nthe optical properties of the crop canopy\
    \ [94]. In order to successfully apply infrared thermometry as a\ntool for assessing\
    \ plant water status, it is important to differentiate between abiotic (such as\
    \ water stress)\nand biotic stresses (such as plant diseases and pest infestation).\
    \ Multiband optical sensors could be\napplied in detecting various crop diseases\
    \ and crop infestation within a ﬁeld by computing vegetation\nindices based on\
    \ canopy reﬂectance measurements [33]. This has been applied by Garcia-Ruiz et\
    \ al. [95]\nfor detecting citrus greening and by Yang et al. [96] for detecting\
    \ infestation of green bugs and aphids\nin wheat. It may be useful to outﬁt precision\
    \ irrigation systems with these sensors.\nThe main advantage of thermal sensing\
    \ for precision irrigation application is related to the\nnon-contact and real-time\
    \ capability of the system. Infrared thermometry and thermography provide\nthe\
    \ opportunity to map the spatial variation in crop water status which can guide\
    \ in variable rate\nirrigation management. The use of thermal sensing for guiding\
    \ zone-speciﬁc water application has\nbeen demonstrated as noted in Section 2.\n\
    A major problem faced in applying the thermal sensing approach is the establishment\
    \ of the\nbaseline temperatures. In climates in which the air humidity is often\
    \ high, variations in wind speed and\nnet radiation introduce signiﬁcant errors\
    \ in the estimation of the lower limit baseline temperature [97].\nA number of\
    \ studies have been conducted to develop procedures for enhancing the possibility\
    \ of\napplying measurements of crop canopy temperature in inferring plant water\
    \ status in humid regions.\nJones [98] provides an excellent summary of these\
    \ research efforts. They include the use of well-watered\nplots to substitute\
    \ for empirical non-water stressed baselines, although these well-watered plots\
    \ are\nrarely available in practice. The use of artiﬁcial reference surfaces for\
    \ measuring baseline temperatures\nhas been proposed but it is reported that these\
    \ artiﬁcial reference surfaces differ signiﬁcantly in thermal\nand radiative properties\
    \ in comparison to real leaves. A modeling approach to simulating the canopy\n\
    resistance of well-watered plants has also been investigated but this is limited\
    \ by the difﬁculties\nencountered in correctly modeling stomata behavior and hence\
    \ canopy resistance. The possibility\nof including a wide range of metrological\
    \ data including net radiation and vapor pressure deﬁcit in\nderiving CWSI models\
    \ for humid climates has also been investigated. The mathematical complexity\n\
    typical of the models however limit their practical application.\nAnother problem\
    \ commonly encountered in applying infrared measurements of canopy\ntemperature\
    \ in inferring plant water status is the inclusion of soil temperature and other\
    \ background\ntemperature including the sky and stems in the measured canopy temperature.\
    \ This usually leads to\nerrors in estimation of the canopy temperature as the\
    \ soil and background temperature are usually\nmany degrees different from the\
    \ canopy temperature [90]. Jones [99] proposed the use of narrow\nSustainability\
    \ 2017, 9, 353\n11 of 29\nacceptance angle infrared sensors that can be positioned\
    \ to view only single leaves as a solution to this\nproblem. It has however been\
    \ found that the temperature estimates of single leaves determined\nby this method\
    \ is mostly not representative of the temperature of the plant canopy.\nA dense\n\
    deployment of infrared sensors may seem an alternative but this may be prohibitive\
    \ in terms of\ncost for practical applications.\nThe advancements in the ﬁeld\
    \ of thermal imagery and the recent availability of low-cost thermal\ncameras\
    \ has presented the possibility of overcoming the problems associated with the\
    \ inclusion of\nsoil and background temperatures in the measured canopy temperature.\
    \ Thermal imagery allows\nfor the average temperature of a deﬁned area to be obtained\
    \ and also the separation of background\ntemperature from the area of interest.\
    \ The temperature of a large number of individual leaves\nmaking up a canopy can\
    \ be included in an image while the soil and background temperature can be\ndiscarded\
    \ by applying automated image processing techniques [92]. Gonzalez-Dugo et al.\
    \ [100] has\ndemonstrated the use of thermal imagery in mapping the crop water\
    \ status in a commercial orchard\nin Spain. They also demonstrated the rapid mapping\
    \ of ﬁeld-scale crop water status by deploying\nthermal imaging equipment on an\
    \ unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).\nPlant-based sensing methods including thermal\
    \ sensing only provide information on the need for\nirrigation and provide no\
    \ information on the volume of irrigation application needed. They are used\n\
    in combination with soil-based sensing for this reason [19].\n6. Decision Support\n\
    A decision support system for irrigation management and scheduling provides a\
    \ framework\nfor incorporating various tools and techniques for site-speciﬁc irrigation\
    \ decisions. The widespread\ncommercial adoption of precision irrigation will\
    \ be predicated on the development of robust and\noptimal decision support systems\
    \ [19].\nA number of decision support systems schedule irrigation at predeﬁned\
    \ intervals and apply\npredeﬁned irrigation volumes. They do not incorporate any\
    \ form of sensor feedback on plant water\nstatus, soil water status and climatic\
    \ variables [101]. This ‘open-loop’ strategy is largely designed based\non heuristics\
    \ and historical data. Mareels et al. [102] suggested that this is an inefﬁcient\
    \ approach often\nleading to overwatering and waste of fertilizer and other supplemental\
    \ crop inputs.\nClosed-loop irrigation strategies aim to irrigate: when the soil\
    \ moisture content reaches a certain\nthreshold [103–105]; when plant sensors\
    \ indicate a certain stress threshold [93,106,107] or with feedback\nfrom crop\
    \ simulation models with the aim of attaining a certain yield, crop physiological\
    \ response or\neconomic objective [108]. These closed-loop irrigation strategies\
    \ have been shown to improve water\nuse efﬁciency in the production of horticultural\
    \ crops under protected environments. Environmental\nconditions in such production\
    \ systems can be controlled based on plant feedback which eliminates the\nstochastic\
    \ plant response often encountered in ﬁeld-scale crop production [109]. Belayneh\
    \ et al. [110]\nimplemented a wireless sensor network of soil moisture sensors\
    \ for closed-loop irrigation control in\na pot-in-pot nursery. A signiﬁcant reduction\
    \ in water use was achieved by the system. The authors\nalso reported a 2.7-year\
    \ payback period for the system. Chappell et al. [111] reported water savings\
    \ of\n83% for a closed-loop irrigation control system implemented in a protected\
    \ crop production system.\nThey noted that there was less occurrence of plant\
    \ diseases in the nursery due to the elimination of\nover-watering. Saavoss et\
    \ al. [112] reported a 65% increase in proﬁt due to the implementation of a\n\
    wireless sensor network-based closed-loop control system in a nursery. The authors\
    \ noted that the\nincrease in proﬁt was due to improvement in crop quality and\
    \ yield resulting from the precise control\nof irrigation applications.\nIn ﬁeld-scale\
    \ crop production, the crop needs vary over time and space due to both biotic\
    \ and\nabiotic factors [9]. McCarthy et al. [113] noted that in these crop production\
    \ systems, closed-loop\nstrategies are unable to account for unknown crop dynamics,\
    \ the stochastic nature of climatic variables\nand crop response, and the time-varying\
    \ nature of the soil-plant-atmosphere system. This last\npoint is especially due\
    \ to crop growth, crop management and infestation of pests and diseases.\nSustainability\
    \ 2017, 9, 353\n12 of 29\nThe closed-loop systems are also unable to consider\
    \ equipment and other operational limitations.\nMcCarthy et al. [114] concluded\
    \ that an optimal decision support system must be ‘adaptive’ with\nthe ability\
    \ of accommodating the temporal and spatial variability within the ﬁeld. The decision\n\
    support system must also have the capability of modifying irrigation decisions\
    \ in response to crop\nphysiology, uncertainties in climatic inputs, soil, irrigation\
    \ systems and water supply limitations,\neconomic considerations and the quality\
    \ of sensor feedback.\n6.1. Adaptive Decision Support\nThe characteristics of\
    \ a cropping system varies over time. Within a cropped system, the properties\n\
    that will typically vary within and between seasons include crop growth, soil\
    \ properties (due to\naddition of nutrients and other management processes) and\
    \ climate. This will have a direct inﬂuence\non the irrigation timing and volume\
    \ required for optimal crop growth [11].\nAn adaptive decision support system\
    \ is able to continuously re-adjust the irrigation scheduling\nalgorithm in order\
    \ to retain the desired performance of the irrigation system [114]. The adaptive\n\
    decision support system is able to utilize historical or real-time sensor data\
    \ to arrive at irrigation\ntiming and volume that adequately accounts for the\
    \ temporal and spatial variability in the ﬁeld [114].\nIn control theory an adaptive\
    \ control system is generally accepted as a control system able to adjust\nits\
    \ controller parameters based on sensor feedback from a process, such that the\
    \ controlled process\nbehaves in a desirable way [11]. McCarthy et al. [108] noted\
    \ that an adaptive decision support system\nfor irrigation may either be sensor-based\
    \ if they use direct sensor measurements for the irrigation\nstrategy or model-based\
    \ if they use a calibrated simulation model to aid irrigation decisions.\nThe\
    \ development of adaptive decision support systems presents an opportunity to\
    \ improve\nsustainability in precision irrigation through improved water use and\
    \ crop productivity. They will\nalso enhance synergistic applications of data\
    \ available from soil, plant and weather sensors to arrive at\noptimal irrigation\
    \ scheduling decisions [108].\nIn this section we will present a brief discussion\
    \ on state-of-the-art of adaptive decision support\nsystems. We will thereafter\
    \ discuss the opportunities these systems present in improving sustainability\n\
    in irrigated agriculture. Readers are referred to [113] for a comprehensive overview\
    \ on the application\nof advanced process control to irrigation, details on methods\
    \ of operation and a consideration of\nfundamental control concepts as they apply\
    \ to irrigation scheduling.\n6.1.1. Mechanistic Models\nA number of irrigation\
    \ decision support systems are based on complex physical models which\nclosely\
    \ resemble the actual physical system [115]. They are able to incorporate the\
    \ physiological and\nmorphological representation of the plant into the decision\
    \ support tool. Barnard and Bauerle [116]\ndescribed an irrigation scheduling\
    \ system based on the spatially explicit biophysical model, MAESTRA\n(Multi-Array\
    \ Evaporation Stand Tree Radiation A), which couples the within-canopy photosynthesis\n\
    and stomatal conductance. Data on leaf temperature, canopy aerodynamics and environmental\n\
    variables are used as inputs into the model to predict the plant transpiration.\
    \ They reported that\nthe model-based tool applied between 18% and 56% more water\
    \ than a sensing-based method for\nscheduling irrigation in four species. They,\
    \ however, noted that the model-based approach produced\ngreater tree growth.\
    \ Asher et al. [117] described a mechanistic model capable of inferring crop water\n\
    requirements. The model employs leaf temperature data as input for determining\
    \ the crop aerodynamic\ncharacteristics which is then used in the Penman–Monteith\
    \ equation for calculating the actual crop\nET. A major drawback of these mechanistic\
    \ models is that they include static parameters which, once\nidentiﬁed, are assumed\
    \ to remain constant over the cropping season. This is rarely so in practice as\
    \ the\ncropping system varies over time due to both biotic and abiotic factors.\n\
    Sustainability 2017, 9, 353\n13 of 29\n6.1.2. Simulations\nCrop simulation models\
    \ based on ﬁrst principle physical models of crop phenology, soil physics\nand\
    \ hydrology can be applied in simulating the crop response to irrigation and cropping\
    \ system\nmanagement [115]. These simulation models provide the opportunity to\
    \ evaluate the beneﬁt of several\nprecision irrigation strategies as they eliminate\
    \ the need for time-consuming ﬁeld experiments [118].\nThey can be interfaced\
    \ with real-time sensor feedback from soil or plant sensors and weather data to\n\
    determine daily irrigation requirements of crops. They can also be used in predicting\
    \ the yield impact\nof an irrigation strategy. This is achieved by employing weather\
    \ forecast data in computing a daily soil\nmoisture balance and assessing the\
    \ impact of soil moisture deﬁcits on crop growth [118].\nDeJonge et al. [14] investigated\
    \ the effect of variable rate irrigation management on corn\nproduction in Iowa\
    \ using the CERES-maize model. Corn yield was compared for a period of 28 years\n\
    under simulated scenarios of no irrigation, scheduled uniform irrigation and precision\
    \ irrigation. They\nreported no signiﬁcant difference in corn yield and water\
    \ use between the uniform irrigation and\nprecision irrigation scenarios. Thorp\
    \ et al. [24] described a methodology for applying the Decision\nSupport System\
    \ for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) crop growth model in analyzing variable\
    \ rate\nmanagement practices including irrigation on crop growth and yield. The\
    \ platform enabled the\nevaluation of precision irrigation strategies on crop\
    \ performance in predeﬁned management zones.\nThese systems are however incapable\
    \ of real-time decision support and can only be applied using\nhistorical data.\n\
    McCarthy et al. [114] proposed a simulation framework, VARIwise, capable of real-time\
    \ decision\nsupport in precision irrigation. The simulation framework is capable\
    \ of incorporating real-time data\ninput from ﬁeld sensors in arriving at irrigation\
    \ decisions. The combination of different sensor inputs\ninto the simulation framework\
    \ enables adaptive decision support with the system being able to\nre-adjust irrigation\
    \ decisions based on plant feedback and also explore optimal control strategies.\n\
    Simulation models for use in irrigation decision support require extensive calibration\
    \ and\nvalidation to establish model accuracy. The limitation in data available\
    \ for this endeavour often\nlimit the use of the platforms to speciﬁc crops.\n\
    6.1.3. Artiﬁcial Intelligence\nArtiﬁcial intelligence presents the potential of\
    \ solving problems in precision irrigation which\nare complex, non-linear and\
    \ ill-deﬁned [119]. Artiﬁcial intelligence algorithms are able to emulate\nthe\
    \ human decision-making process when applied to a particular problem domain. They\
    \ have been\ndeployed for implementing adaptive decision support in irrigation\
    \ in form of artiﬁcial neural networks,\nfuzzy logic and expert systems with mixed\
    \ success to date [118–120].\nArtiﬁcial Neural Networks\nArtiﬁcial neural networks\
    \ (ANN) are non-linear mapping structures employed in modeling when\nthe underlying\
    \ data relationship is not well deﬁned. ANN are able to identify and learn correlations\n\
    between input data and corresponding target output values. They are able to predict\
    \ the outcome of\nnew independent data sets making them a useful tool in predictive\
    \ modeling [121]. ANN are well\nsuited for the irrigation decision support problem\
    \ that can often be complex and stochastic in nature.\nThese networks are also\
    \ adaptive in nature and are able to continuously learn in order to provide\n\
    optimal solutions to target problems in dynamic systems.\nKarasekreter et al.\
    \ [122] implemented an ANN for scheduling irrigation in a strawberry orchard\n\
    using soil moisture and its physical properties as model inputs. The system was\
    \ able to achieve water\nsavings of 20.5% and an energy saving of 23.9%. ANN however\
    \ require large datasets for training and\nare unable to describe the physical\
    \ dynamics of a system. This makes their use limited in real-time\ndecision support\
    \ tools.\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n14 of 29\nFuzzy Logic\nFuzzy logic is an\
    \ artificial intelligence algorithm that can be used to model a process and relate\
    \ it\nto human experience in arriving at decisions. A fuzzy logic system is made\
    \ up of a set used to classify\ninput data into membership classes, a decision\
    \ rule that is applied to each set which culminates in a\nhuman-like decision\
    \ output from the system [123]. A detailed description of the process is given\
    \ in [124].\nMousa and Abdullah [123] successfully applied a fuzzy logic model\
    \ in scheduling irrigation in\ndrip and sprinkler irrigation systems using ET,\
    \ soil moisture data and crop growth stage as model\ninputs. Prakashgoud and Desai\
    \ [124] employed a fuzzy logic system using soil moisture data, leaf\nwetness\
    \ and climatological data as model inputs in order to implement irrigation scheduling\
    \ decisions.\nThe system was capable of maintaining soil moisture thresholds in\
    \ the speciﬁed range. Giusti and\nMarsili-Libelli [125] described an adaptive\
    \ irrigation decision support system implemented with fuzzy\nlogic. The system\
    \ incorporates a predictive model of the soil moisture and an inference system\
    \ for\nmaintaining the soil moisture within an acceptable threshold. The system\
    \ was reported to adapt\nirrigation decisions to rainfall uncertainty and produced\
    \ water savings of 13.55% over a simulation\nperiod of 168 days.\nThe accuracy\
    \ of fuzzy logic systems is largely tied to an in-depth knowledge of the system.\
    \ They\nalso lack an inner mechanistic structure with the domain of applicability\
    \ limited to the range of training\ndata used in setting them up. Delgoda et al.\
    \ [115] suggested that the points mentioned makes decision\nmaking with a fuzzy\
    \ system an ad hoc process limiting its application in adaptive decision support.\n\
    Expert Systems\nAn expert system is a tool able to emulate the reasoning process\
    \ a human expert would employ\nin a decision-making process in his/her ﬁeld of\
    \ expertise. It captures the human decision-making\nexpertise and heuristics representing\
    \ it in a series of rules and facts [126]. An expert system typically\nconsists\
    \ of a knowledge base component and an inference engine that acts as a reasoning\
    \ tool [127].\nExpert systems are especially suited to dynamic problems that are\
    \ of a complex nature. They are also\nwell suited to dealing with incomplete and\
    \ uncertain data [128]. This makes them well suited for\nirrigation decision support\
    \ which often requires the input of experts to arrive at optimal decisions.\n\
    Expert systems applied in irrigation decision support can be classiﬁed as either\
    \ ‘expert systems\nproper’ or hybrid expert systems. A detailed review on the\
    \ application of expert systems in irrigation\ndecision support is given in [128,129].\
    \ The ‘expert systems proper’ class of irrigation decision support\ntools schedule\
    \ irrigation based on soil moisture and climatic data. They are unable to consider\
    \ the\ntime-varying nature of the cropping system (crop growth, disease and pest\
    \ infestation) to arrive at\noptimal irrigation decisions. They are also unable\
    \ to account for the stochastic nature of climatic\nvariables and are not well\
    \ suited for real-time applications [129].\nHybrid expert systems which are also\
    \ referred to as model-based expert systems combine\nalgorithmic techniques and\
    \ a knowledge-based component in solving problems relevant to its\napplication\
    \ domain. Its advantage in irrigation is that optimal irrigation decision can\
    \ be made\nby combining expert knowledge with data feedback from inﬁeld sensors,\
    \ data-driven models and crop\nsimulation models [130]. Thomson and Ross [131]\
    \ described a model-based expert system designed\nfor decision support in irrigation\
    \ management. The system employs feedback from soil moisture\nsensors to adjust\
    \ the input of a crop simulation model, PNUTGRO (peanut crop growth simulation\n\
    model), and also incorporates the capability of sensor feedback validation. The\
    \ system was reported\nto maintain soil moisture at the deﬁned thresholds. Goumopoulos\
    \ et al. [38] developed an expert\nsystem-based adaptive decision support platform\
    \ for zone-speciﬁc irrigation of strawberry plants.\nThe system includes a wireless\
    \ sensor network of soil, climate and plant sensors providing feedback\nfor the\
    \ decision support system. It also includes a machine learning process capable\
    \ of inferring new\nrules and extending the knowledge base from logged data sets.\
    \ The system was reported to reduce\nirrigation water consumption by around 20%.\
    \ A hybrid expert system based on real-time soil moisture\ndata with the capability\
    \ of incorporating plant models is described in Kohanbash et al. [132].\nSustainability\
    \ 2017, 9, 353\n15 of 29\nThe performance of an expert system is largely dependent\
    \ on the effectiveness of the knowledge\nacquisition process. An error in this\
    \ process will drastically affect the system reliability and its performance.\n\
    6.1.4. Learning Control\nLearning control decision support strategies perform\
    \ systems identiﬁcation using sensor feedback\nwithout deﬁning a mathematical\
    \ model [113]. Systems identiﬁcation models a dynamic system based\non a time\
    \ series of measured input/output data [133]. A comprehensive overview on the\
    \ theory of\nsystems identiﬁcation is presented in [134].\nIterative learning\
    \ control can be applied in systems with ill-deﬁned models that operate\nrepetitively\
    \ and assume the same initial condition after each iteration.\nIt is well suited\
    \ to the\nirrigation problem as irrigation scheduling and application is a repetitive\
    \ problem over the crop\nseason. The time-varying nature of the soil–plant–atmosphere\
    \ system can also be viewed as an\nill-deﬁned problem. The strategy is also able\
    \ to improve system performance by eliminating the effects\nof a repeating disturbance\
    \ with undeﬁned dynamics. Applied to irrigation, this may be a measured\ncrop\
    \ response that reoccurs as a consequence of irrigation. The temporal changes\
    \ in crop water use\nand weather conditions are not considered [113].\nMcCarthy\
    \ et al. [114] noted that a drawback of the iterative learning approach may be\
    \ the\ninefﬁcient systems identiﬁcation resulting from the slow system dynamics\
    \ of the crop system in\nresponse to irrigation events. This results from the\
    \ evaluation of the effect of only one irrigation\nvolume on plant response at\
    \ any water application event. They suggested that this drawback may be\neliminated\
    \ by applying the process of iterative hill climbing control. This learning control\
    \ strategy\nemploys an adaptive varied identiﬁcation process. A range of irrigation\
    \ volumes are applied at each\nirrigation event to a number of test cells on the\
    \ ﬁeld. The response in the test cell that best matches\nthe desired system performance\
    \ is identiﬁed as the optimal irrigation process. They reported that\nthe iterative\
    \ hill climbing control procedure was capable of maximizing cotton yield when\
    \ used\nwith a combination of plant and soil sensors to provide feedback for the\
    \ identiﬁcation procedure.\nTheir conclusions were however based on results from\
    \ a simulation study and a ﬁeld-based validation\nof the procedure was not reported.\n\
    The results of the learning control procedure are based solely on sensor measurements\
    \ and may be\nlargely affected by sensor drift as a model of the crop response\
    \ is not developed from the identiﬁcation\nprocedure. This method can be considered\
    \ more of a “brute force” approach than a scientiﬁcally based\napproach to scheduling\
    \ irrigation.\n6.1.5. Model Predictive Control\nModel predictive control (MPC)\
    \ is an industrial control approach employed in decision support\nfor large-scale\
    \ multivariable problems with multiple constraints. It has been successfully implemented\n\
    in the food industry, petrochemical industry and power generation among others\
    \ [135]. Model\npredictive control employs a plant model and optimization algorithm\
    \ to calculate plant inputs in order\nto achieve a future value of a performance\
    \ criterion. The system performance is predicted over a ﬁnite\nhorizon subject\
    \ to constraints on both the inputs and outputs of the plant [101]. Readers are\
    \ directed\nto [135–137] for an in-depth review of the theory of model predictive\
    \ control and its application in\nvarious industries.\nIn the case of irrigation,\
    \ applying a soil moisture balance model, the plant input will be the\nirrigation\
    \ amount, the plant output will be the soil moisture deﬁcit, and both crop ET\
    \ and precipitation\nvalues will be considered as disturbances as they cannot\
    \ be controlled. A prediction of future input\nvalues and disturbances is required\
    \ in an MPC system in order to determine the optimal system\noutput [138]. This\
    \ highlights the need for the incorporation of weather forecast data into the\
    \ MPC\nframework for irrigation decision support.\nModel predictive control appears\
    \ to be well suited to the domain of irrigation decision support.\nThe irrigation\
    \ problem has input constraints in terms of optimal irrigation volume and output\n\
    Sustainability 2017, 9, 353\n16 of 29\nconstraints in terms of soil moisture thresholds\
    \ and the desired plant response to water deﬁcits [135].\nOoi et al. [139], Lozoya\
    \ et al. [101] and Saleem et al. [135] described a model predictive control\n\
    framework for irrigation scheduling based on a soil moisture balance model. They\
    \ employed a\nsystem identiﬁcation procedure to generate a grey box model of the\
    \ soil–plant–atmosphere system\nwith a network of soil moisture sensors providing\
    \ real-time feedback to the control algorithm. They\nall reported the ability\
    \ of the MPC platform to sufﬁciently predict crop irrigation needs and also\n\
    observations of signiﬁcant water savings. The authors of the discussed systems\
    \ however fail to account\nfor the stochastic nature of rainfall and crop water\
    \ use in the system dynamics. Delgoda et al. [138]\nnoted that an adequate consideration\
    \ of the uncertainty in rainfall and ET inputs into the water balance\nmodel employed\
    \ in the MPC framework will improve the capability of the MPC system.\nDelgoda\
    \ et al. [115] addressed the drawbacks noted in the above MPC frameworks by employing\n\
    disturbance afﬁne feedback control, an uncertainty modelling technique widely\
    \ applied in MPC\nto account for the stochastic nature of rainfall and crop water\
    \ use. A simple order model of soil\nmoisture dynamics is included in the system\
    \ to enable online calculation of model parameters, hence\naccounting for the\
    \ time-varying nature of soil-plant-atmosphere system. The authors reported an\n\
    optimal performance of the system in humid regions where considerable uncertainties\
    \ in climatic\nvariables exist.\n6.2. Commercial Sensor Applications in Adaptive\
    \ Decision Support\nManufacturers of sensors and a number of system integrators\
    \ are showing considerable interest\nin developing innovative tools that will\
    \ further optimize irrigation water use.\nA sensor integration project is described\
    \ by AgSmarts (Memphis, TN, USA). Moving irrigation\nsystems are equipped with\
    \ sensors which provide data on crop growth stage and soil proﬁle. Aquaspy\nsoil\
    \ moisture sensors (San Diego, CA, USA) positioned in various parts of the ﬁeld\
    \ also provide data\non soil moisture status which is applied in irrigation timing\
    \ and calculation of irrigation volumes.\nThese irrigation decisions are automatically\
    \ adjusted based on the varying water requirements at each\ncrop growth stage\
    \ [140].\nOmica, Italy has deployed a wireless sensor network of Libelium environmental\
    \ and soil moisture\nsensors (Zaragoza, Spain) on a maize farm in Italy to support\
    \ irrigation decisions. The sensors\nare interfaced to a geo-referenced decision\
    \ support system which enables zone-speciﬁc irrigation\nmanagement. The system\
    \ is able to predict crop yield based on irrigation timing and application\nvolumes\
    \ combined with historical yield data. This can then be applied in optimizing\
    \ the decision\nsupport system towards achieving a desired crop yield goal.\n\
    Most decision support systems presently produced for commercial use provide on/off\
    \ irrigation\ncontrol based on speciﬁed thresholds and plant/crop sensor feedback.\
    \ The incorporation of predictive\nmodels into these systems will enhance the\
    \ possibility of improving irrigation water use and crop\nyield [141].\n7. Opportunities\
    \ for Improving Sustainability\nSustainability is premised on the principle of\
    \ meeting the needs of the present generation without\ncompromising the ability\
    \ of future generations to meet their own needs. Sustainable agriculture is\n\
    focused on developing farming practices that are safe and do not have an adverse\
    \ impact on the\nenvironment [142].\nPretty [143] suggested that sustainable agriculture\
    \ integrates the main goals of environmental\nhealth and economic proﬁtability.\
    \ The efﬁcient and effective use of water is considered the main driver\nfor improving\
    \ sustainability in irrigated agriculture. This will involve the use of less water\
    \ for irrigating\ncrops and also preserving the quality of water sources. Conventional\
    \ irrigation practices apply water\nuniformly over a ﬁeld resulting in a high\
    \ volume of water use. Overirrigation may also result from\nthis practice which\
    \ causes leaching of nitrates and nutrients into ground water sources. An important\n\
    consideration would also be the use of less energy for operating water pumps and\
    \ irrigation application\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n17 of 29\nequipment. Soil\
    \ erosion continues to be a serious threat to sustainability in irrigated agriculture.\
    \ This\ncan be eliminated by applying precise irrigation volumes to reduce surface\
    \ runoff.\nPrecision irrigation presents a promising platform for improving sustainability\
    \ in irrigated\nagriculture. This is especially hinged on the possibility of eliminating\
    \ the adverse environmental\nimpacts related to conventional irrigation practices\
    \ with the adoption of precision irrigation.\nThe economic proﬁtability of the\
    \ adoption of precision irrigation is however a very important point\nto consider.\
    \ This will be manifested in terms of improved crop yields and increased water\
    \ savings\nincluding the associated reduction in energy consumption resulting\
    \ from the optimal matching of\nirrigation inputs to the spatial water demands\
    \ of the ﬁeld, thus reducing costs [11].\nPrecision irrigation is predicated on\
    \ the hypothesis that the crop water requirements vary spatially\nacross a ﬁeld.\
    \ In heterogeneous crops such as fruit orchards, this variability is also due\
    \ to physiological\nfactors such as leaf area and fruit load [144]. It is assumed\
    \ that varying water application across the ﬁeld\nto meet this spatial crop water\
    \ need will improve crop yield and reduce the costs of associated inputs.\nSmith\
    \ et al. [11] noted that the evidence to support this hypothesis in commercial\
    \ crop production is\nnot readily found in literature.\nEvans and King [18] reviewed\
    \ much of the work prior to that date focused on analysing the\nimprovements in\
    \ crop yield and water savings achievable with precision irrigation and suggested\
    \ that\nthe greatest savings are likely to occur in humid climates by the increased\
    \ utilization of stored moisture\nand in-season precipitation. Results from simulation-\
    \ and ﬁeld-based case studies they reviewed\nshowed water savings of 0% to 26%\
    \ for well-watered crop production employing precision irrigation\nstrategies.\
    \ No signiﬁcant improvements in crop yields resulting from the adoption of precision\n\
    irrigation were reported. They concluded that in arid and semi-arid regions, precision\
    \ irrigation is\nmore suited to maximize net return rather than yield and it may\
    \ have greater potential in reducing\nirrigation water use in humid climates when\
    \ irrigating to maximally utilize in-season precipitation.\nThey further noted\
    \ that the economic beneﬁt of adopting precision irrigation for ﬁeld-scale crop\n\
    production is limited. This is because the cost of equipment, maintenance and\
    \ management is much\ngreater than the revenue improvements achieved as a result\
    \ of improved yield and water savings.\nThe payback period of implementing the\
    \ technology may also exceed the useful life of the water\napplication equipment,\
    \ typically placed at 15 years. A payback period ranging from 5 to 20 years is\n\
    noted in Smith et al. [11] for the adoption of precision irrigation for crop production\
    \ in New Zealand.\nEvans et al. [145] reviewed the adoption trends of spatially\
    \ varied irrigation in the USA covering\na period of 20 years. They noted that\
    \ about only 200 of the 175,000 moving irrigation systems in the\nUSA were ﬁtted\
    \ with variable rate water application technology. They suggested higher net returns\
    \ on\ninvestment as a stimuli for adoption of precision irrigation by growers.\
    \ Growers that had adopted the\ntechnology reported no signiﬁcant savings in water\
    \ and energy use in non-limiting water situations.\nThey noted that in more than\
    \ 20 years of research pertaining to variable rate irrigation management,\nthe\
    \ economic beneﬁt was yet to be demonstrated. This was attributed to the marginal\
    \ water savings\n(5%–15%) which is insufﬁcient to realize a payback for the initial\
    \ investment in the water application\ntechnology. They concluded that an economic\
    \ strategy that optimizes net return rather than total\nreturns for the technology\
    \ should be adopted as a long-term investment goal.\nHeeren et al. [146] conducted\
    \ a simulation study to assess the reductions in pumping costs\nthrough the adoption\
    \ of precision irrigation in 49,224 centre-pivot irrigated ﬁelds in Nebraska,\
    \ USA.\nThe study focused on applying variable rate water applications in mining\
    \ undepleted available water.\nThey noted that the reduction in pumping costs\
    \ achieved from the adoption of precision irrigation\nin all ﬁelds may be negligible\
    \ in comparison to the cost of variable rate water application equipment.\nThey\
    \ concluded that the adoption of this technology will be economically justiﬁable\
    \ only with an\nincrease in energy costs.\nAn economic evaluation of spatially\
    \ varied irrigation applications is presented in Lee [147].\nThe study assessed\
    \ energy savings resulting from pumping lesser volumes of water for irrigation\
    \ on\na 67-acre ﬁeld in Wyoming. The cost of installing the variable rate water\
    \ application equipment on\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n18 of 29\nthe ﬁeld was\
    \ reported as $29,513 with a useful equipment life of 15 years. The yearly return\
    \ for the\nequipment based on energy savings achieved was computed as $1816.71,\
    \ which equates to a payback\nperiod of 16.25 years. This suggests that a payback\
    \ will only be realized for the technology outside the\nuseful life of the equipment.\n\
    Precision irrigation offers the beneﬁt of providing water conservation beneﬁts\
    \ by avoiding\noverirrigation and the associated adverse environmental impacts\
    \ [18]. Sadler et al. [148] discussed\nwater conservation strategies where precision\
    \ irrigation can potentially reduce the total water applied\nand improve the environmental\
    \ quality of irrigated ﬁelds. They suggested that programing zero\nirrigation\
    \ amounts to non-cropped areas will improve water conservation using precision\
    \ irrigation.\nThey also noted that adjusting spatial water application based\
    \ on the inﬁltration rate of the soil and\nsoil water storage capacity will reduce\
    \ the occurrence of surface runoff and soil erosion. Surface runoff\nand leaching\
    \ were identiﬁed as the major avenues for loss of nutrients from the soil. They\
    \ suggested\nthe occurrence of this can be eliminated by spatial application of\
    \ precise irrigation volumes based on\nthe soil water-holding characteristics.\
    \ They presented several case studies in which the adoption of\nprecision irrigation\
    \ has been demonstrated to enhance the environmental quality of irrigated ﬁelds.\n\
    They concluded that precision irrigation has the capability of improving water\
    \ use efﬁciencies while\nreducing the adverse environmental impacts associated\
    \ with conventional irrigation practices.\nThe results from the above studies\
    \ show that precision irrigation is a proven tool for improving\nsustainability\
    \ in irrigated agriculture in terms of enhancing environmental health. Its economic\n\
    justiﬁcation in terms of signiﬁcant yield improvements and water savings is however\
    \ limited.\nEvans and King [18] suggested that the lack of signiﬁcant improvements\
    \ in yield response when\nemploying precision irrigation may result from the fact\
    \ that the yield response to the water curve\nnear maximum yield (100% ET) is\
    \ almost ﬂat, with small changes in water applied using precision\nirrigation\
    \ having little effect on yield. The majority of these precision irrigation studies\
    \ have used only\nsoil data for irrigation management. The local microclimate\
    \ and crop genetics may however have a\ndirect inﬂuence on the yield response\
    \ of the crops.\nSoil moisture status may also not provide a complete indication\
    \ of crop water status, rather the\nplant may be the best indicator of water availability.\
    \ The decision support systems employed by\ncurrent precision irrigation systems\
    \ assume that the soil–plant–atmosphere system never varies with\ntime. The characteristics\
    \ of the crop, soil and climate vary within the season altering the timing and\n\
    optimal amount of irrigation volume required at any irrigation application event.\n\
    We argue that the incorporation of multiple sensed variables (plant, soil and\
    \ weather data) will\nenhance the possibility of arriving at optimal irrigation\
    \ decisions and hence an improvement in\neconomic outcomes. This should be integrated\
    \ with a decision support system that has the capability\nto adapt to the time-varying\
    \ nature of the cropping system. The decision support system should also\nhave\
    \ the capacity to ‘learn’ in order to improve its performance based on experience\
    \ and a target crop\nproduction function. We discuss how this can be achieved\
    \ by exploiting improvements in monitoring\nand management considerations.\n7.1.\
    \ Monitoring Considerations\nA precision irrigation system is designed to apply\
    \ water at a differential rate in response to the\ntemporal and spatial variation\
    \ in crop water need across a ﬁeld. This process is supported by a number\nof\
    \ sensors providing data to a real-time decision support system. These sensors\
    \ include weather\nstations, soil moisture sensors, environmental sensors, plant\
    \ sensors and thermal sensors which may\nbe integrated into a wireless sensor\
    \ network. A careful design of these sensing systems including a\nconsideration\
    \ of factors affecting their performance is crucial in realizing the goal of improved\
    \ water\nuse through precision irrigation.\nDielectric soil moisture sensors sense\
    \ the water content of the immediate soil in their zone\nof inﬂuence. The zone\
    \ of inﬂuence reported for most commercial dielectric soil moisture sensors\n\
    corresponds to a cylindrical measurement volume of 1.5 L [149]. It is therefore\
    \ important to install\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n19 of 29\nthe sensors in\
    \ areas representative of the soil moisture available for plant use. The normal\
    \ practice\nemployed by most users is to place the sensors in the driest regions\
    \ of the ﬁeld or in the regions\ncomprising of a soil proﬁle with the lowest available\
    \ water-holding capacity [150]. Adopting this\napproach will most likely lead\
    \ to wetter regions in the ﬁeld receiving more frequent irrigation which\nwill\
    \ consequently result in overirrigation. A more efﬁcient approach is to deﬁne\
    \ irrigation management\nzones and place a number of sensors in each management\
    \ zone to give the average soil moisture\nestimate. This may however be limited\
    \ by cost.\nA structured installation proﬁle is also necessary in order to capture\
    \ soil water movement and\navailability. It is recommended that sensors should\
    \ be installed at each soil horizon along the plant\nrooting zone [151]. An accepted\
    \ convention is the installation of sensors at three to four depths along\nthe\
    \ rooting zone (1 per 25% of total rooting depth). The sensor located on the uppermost\
    \ soil proﬁle\nis able to detect precipitation events, the sensor in the deepest\
    \ part of the proﬁle is able to detect\ndrainage and the other sensors located\
    \ midway in the soil proﬁle are able to capture soil moisture\ndynamics useful\
    \ in supporting irrigation scheduling decisions [152]. The variation in soil properties\n\
    at the different rooting depths should also be taken into account. With an increasing\
    \ knowledge of\nthe site, it is usually possible to install the sensors at two\
    \ depths and still adequately capture the soil\nmoisture dynamics. The soil moisture\
    \ sensors should also be deployed using soil-speciﬁc calibration\nequations to\
    \ enable accurate estimates of soil moisture content.\nThe actual crop evapotranspiration\
    \ can vary spatially and temporally under conditions of\nunrestricted water supply.\
    \ These variations can be the result of several factors including differences\n\
    in crop genetics, plant density, weed competition, pest intensity, nutrient availability\
    \ and stage of\ngrowth [18]. Addressing the variation in ET across a ﬁeld may\
    \ result in signiﬁcant water savings.\nThe accurate measurement of evapotranspiration\
    \ is crucial in arriving at optimal irrigation\ndecisions [71]. The FAO-PM procedure\
    \ for calculating ET which is applied in many precision irrigation\nsystems relies\
    \ on information from weather stations applied in calculating a reference ET which\
    \ is\nadjusted for speciﬁc crops using crop coefﬁcients. This calculated ET is\
    \ assumed to be uniform for every\npart of the ﬁeld. This will however result\
    \ in the application of inaccurate irrigation volumes to replace\ncrop water use,\
    \ owing to the spatial nature of the actual ET. The application of the NDVI technique\n\
    in determining site-speciﬁc crop coefﬁcients provides a platform for overcoming\
    \ this challenge.\nThe surface renewal analysis procedure also presents a promising\
    \ tool for quantifying the actual\ncrop ET. It is however best suited to homogeneous,\
    \ short and dense canopies.\nPlant-based measurements provide the best indication\
    \ of plant water status as they provide a direct\nmeasure of the plants’ response\
    \ to soil moisture availability and climatic demand. An efficient plant-based\n\
    monitoring system should however respond sensitively to the slightest change in\
    \ water deficits.\nMeasurements of leaf water potential and sap ﬂow are contact\
    \ methods which give direct\ninformation on plant water status but their spatial\
    \ resolution is limited as many samples are required\nto effectively monitor the\
    \ dynamics of ﬁeld-scale plant water status [153]. Infrared thermometry has\n\
    provided a robust platform for assessing plant water status. The (CWSI calculated\
    \ from the infrared\nmeasurements of crop canopy temperature can adequately quantify\
    \ ﬁeld-scale crop water status with\nhigh spatial and temporal resolution. This\
    \ presents a robust and cost-effective tool for use in precision\nirrigation.\
    \ Its application in humid regions is however marred with difﬁculties.\nA systems\
    \ engineering approach can be applied in overcoming the difficulties encountered\
    \ with\napplying the CWSI in humid climates. A mathematical model derived using\
    \ this approach may adequately\nsimulate the real-time dynamics of the baseline\
    \ temperatures required for computing the index.\nA summary of the technology\
    \ gaps and reﬁnements necessary in monitoring tools in order to\nachieve robust\
    \ precision irrigation management is presented in [11]. They include the limited\
    \ volume\nof inﬂuence, high cost and the need to improve the measurement accuracy\
    \ of soil moisture sensors.\nThe reﬁnements recommended include the development\
    \ of low cost soil measurement sensors with\na wider volume of inﬂuence, low cost\
    \ and resilient wireless communication networks able to link\nspatially deployed\
    \ soil moisture sensors and the development of smart calibration software in order\n\
    Sustainability 2017, 9, 353\n20 of 29\nto improve the accuracy of soil moisture\
    \ sensors. The technology gaps identiﬁed in plant sensing\ntechnology include\
    \ the limited knowledge of irrigation thresholds and quantity, and low spatial\n\
    resolution. The reﬁnements recommended include the integration of plant-based\
    \ sensing with soil\nmoisture sensing tools in order to determine irrigation volumes,\
    \ calibration of infra-red thermography\nagainst physiologically explicit plant\
    \ measurements in order to determine critical thresholds and the\ndeployment of\
    \ IR thermography tools on low altitude UAVs to further enhance spatial coverage.\n\
    A combination of multiple sensor inputs deployed at a density that captures spatial\
    \ variability\nis therefore likely to yield the most robust and accurate solution\
    \ for precision irrigation. This will\nensure that the decision support system\
    \ is robust to data availability, gaps and deﬁciencies. This will\ninclude data\
    \ from soil, weather and plant sensors [11]. An important consideration will also\
    \ include\ndeveloping cost-effective and user-friendly tools which will enhance\
    \ the adoption of these adaptive\nsystems by farmers.\n7.2. Management Considerations\n\
    Management can perhaps be viewed as the most vital aspect of a precision irrigation\
    \ system.\nManagement acts as an interface between monitoring and decision support,\
    \ culminating into irrigation\ndecisions. This enables the implementation of vital\
    \ management decisions of when and where to\napply irrigation and also the irrigation\
    \ volumes to be applied. The decision support system is perhaps\nthe management\
    \ backbone of a precision irrigation system and its proper implementation is vital\
    \ for\nimproving sustainability in irrigated agriculture.\nThe adaptive decision\
    \ support tools discussed have the capability of improving crop yield and\nwater\
    \ savings when deployed as part of a precision irrigation system. Smith et al.\
    \ [11] noted that\nthe simulation of adaptive decision support strategies can\
    \ be used in identifying optimal irrigation\nscheduling decisions. A simulation\
    \ tool capable of representing a range of ﬁeld conditions at different\nspatial\
    \ and temporal scales is considered ideal. Such a simulation framework is presented\
    \ in [114].\nModel-based decision support systems using feedback from multiple\
    \ sensors may present a\nplatform for arriving at optimal water applications.\
    \ MPC appears to be ideally suited for achieving the\naim of improving sustainability\
    \ in irrigated agriculture. A decision support system based on MPC\nemploys an\
    \ optimization algorithm to implement an input strategy with the best performance.\n\
    McCarthy et al. [113] noted that MPC implemented for a precision irrigation system\
    \ could involve\nthe use of real-time data from ﬁeld sensors to calibrate a crop\
    \ or soil model and then optimizing this\ncalibrated model to arrive at optimal\
    \ irrigation scheduling decisions. A combination of data from soil\nmoisture sensors,\
    \ thermal sensors and weather sensors would be appropriate for MPC. The data from\n\
    the sensors would most likely be required daily, as measurements are not required\
    \ at a high temporal\nresolution to calibrate the model. A dense deployment of\
    \ these sensors is however required to account\nfor the spatial nature of ﬁeld-scale\
    \ crop water use. The thermal sensors may be mounted on a moving\nplatform for\
    \ spatial data collection across the ﬁeld.\nEquipment availability, irrigation\
    \ system capacity and other operational considerations can be\nincorporated as\
    \ system-level constraints in an MPC-based decision support system. These constraints\n\
    can be considered to arrive at future irrigation scheduling decisions [113].\n\
    MPC uses a model’s simulation to determine the optimum irrigation application\
    \ timing and\nvolume. When combined with a soft sensing system, variables that\
    \ are not directly measured can be\ncontrolled and optimized. This presents a\
    \ possibility of applying decision support systems based on\nMPC in realising\
    \ a desired crop yield and also a water-saving goal [136].\nThere has been considerable\
    \ research into water use procedures that can achieve improved water\nsavings\
    \ in irrigated agriculture, particularly deﬁcit irrigation. Deﬁcit irrigation\
    \ (DI) is an irrigation\nstrategy in which a crop is exposed to a level of water\
    \ stress at certain growth stages in its development\n(regulated deﬁcit irrigation)\
    \ or throughout its growth season. The growth stage in which the plant is\nsubjected\
    \ to water stress is predetermined as a drought tolerant stage. The goal of deﬁcit\
    \ irrigation is\nthat there will be little adverse effect on yield and irrigation\
    \ water can be conserved [154]. Evans and\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n21 of\
    \ 29\nKing [18] suggested deﬁcit irrigation as a tool for improving water use\
    \ in precision irrigation. They\nnoted that it can be applied in maximizing net\
    \ returns and conserve large amounts of water in arid\nand semi-arid regions.\n\
    It is however important to investigate the response of different crops to water\
    \ deﬁcits including\ntiming tolerances in order to develop optimal deﬁcit irrigation\
    \ strategies that can be integrated into\nthe precision irrigation decision support\
    \ framework. It is also important to investigate the economics\nof yield reduction\
    \ associated with deﬁcit irrigation strategies. O’Shaughnessy et al. [33] suggested\
    \ that\nimplementing deﬁcit irrigation as part of precision irrigation management\
    \ will involve the continuous\nassessment of crop stress and growth stage throughout\
    \ the growing season. This will be instrumental in\navoiding temporary severe\
    \ stress which could result in uneconomic reduction in crop yield or quality.\n\
    The high cost of the component technologies of precision irrigation including\
    \ soil, plant and\nweather sensors, decision support systems and variable rate\
    \ water application systems is presently\na constraint to the wide-scale adoption\
    \ of this technology by farmers [148]. The minimal yield\nimprovements and water\
    \ savings currently achieved through ﬁeld-scale precision irrigation may\nnot\
    \ justify the initial capital investment required for its adoption. As fresh water\
    \ resources become\nscarcer, it is expected that more premium will be placed on\
    \ water abstracted for irrigated agriculture.\nRegulatory agencies may also require\
    \ farmers to continuously demonstrate the efﬁcient use of water.\nThese factors\
    \ may promote the adoption of precision irrigation by farmers [155].\nA conceptual\
    \ model-based decision support system that uses the full range of plant, weather\
    \ and\nsoil data for irrigation management is illustrated in Figure 1. This is\
    \ currently being developed by the\nauthors. It involves the integration of various\
    \ sensing systems, dynamic modeling, machine learning\nand model predictive control\
    \ into an adaptive decision support system for precision irrigation.\nSustainability\
    \ 2017, 9, 353  \n21 of 29 \ncontinuous assessment of crop stress and growth stage\
    \ throughout the growing season. This will be \ninstrumental in avoiding temporary\
    \ severe stress which could result in uneconomic reduction in crop \nyield or\

    \ including soil, plant and \nweather sensors, decision support systems and variable\
    \ rate water application systems is presently a \nconstraint to the wide-scale\
    \ adoption of this technology by farmers [148]. The minimal yield \nimprovements\
    \ and water savings currently achieved through field-scale precision irrigation\
    \ may not \njustify the initial capital investment required for its adoption.\
    \ As fresh water resources become \nscarcer, it is expected that more premium\
    \ will be placed on water abstracted for irrigated agriculture. \nRegulatory agencies\
    \ may also require farmers to continuously demonstrate the efficient use of water.\
    \ \nThese factors may promote the adoption of precision irrigation by farmers\
    \ [155]. \nA conceptual model-based decision support system that uses the full\
    \ range of plant, weather \nand soil data for irrigation management is illustrated\
    \ in Figure 1. This is currently being developed \nby the authors. It involves\
    \ the integration of various sensing systems, dynamic modeling, machine \nlearning\
    \ and model predictive control into an adaptive decision support system for precision\
    \ \nirrigation.  \n \n \nFigure 1. Conceptual model-based decision support system\

    Technological innovations that can improve sustainability in irrigated agriculture\
    \ form an\nimportant vehicle for actualizing the optimal use of limited water\
    \ resources. Precision irrigation\nhas been demonstrated as such an innovation,\
    \ though presently the economic beneﬁt related to\nthe adoption of this technology\
    \ at ﬁeld-scale crop production is minimal.\nThis is because the\npotential for\
    \ yield improvements and water savings may not cover the cost of technology required\
    \ for\nits implementation.\nThe application of adaptive control techniques to\
    \ irrigation decision support and improvements\nin monitoring tools has the capability\
    \ of dealing with the time-varying and stochastic nature of the\nsoil–plant–atmosphere\
    \ system while also considering operational limitations in arriving at optimal\n\
    irrigation decisions. This ultimately presents a platform for actualizing the\
    \ environmental and\neconomic goals of sustainability in irrigated agriculture.\n\
    A robust design of monitoring tools including a proper combination of soil, weather\
    \ and plant\nsensors is however vital for the proper operation of an adaptive\
    \ decision support system. The decision\nsupport system should be able to account\
    \ for the varying crop water requirements within season as a\nresult of both biotic\
    \ and abiotic factors. The decision support system should also consider agronomic\n\
    objectives to ensure the optimal irrigation strategy is delivered by the precision\
    \ irrigation system.\nThe high cost of sensors and the requirement for dense deployment\
    \ in order to obtain data at\nhigh spatial resolutions is presently a constraint.\
    \ The large dataset required for the calibration of crop\nsimulation models is\
    \ also another signiﬁcant problem. Future research needs include the development\n\
    of cost-effective soil moisture sensors with wider spheres of inﬂuence, identiﬁcation\
    \ of irrigation\nthresholds for plant-based sensors and the development of self-learning\
    \ crop simulation models that\nare able to infer relationships from a limited\
    \ data set. The ﬁeld evaluation of adaptive decision support\nsystems would also\
    \ be beneﬁcial in quantifying their sustainability improvement potential.\nAcknowledgments:\
